PREFACE


Having so lately in my volumes on the Recent and Fossil Lepadid
expressed as strongly as I could and with the utmost sincerity the
obligations under which I lie to very many naturalists I will not
here repeat my thanks and will only say that the assistance formerly
rendered me from so many quarters has been most kindly continued
without intermission The references under the Habitats in which I
may remark the names of Mr Cuming and of Mr Stutchbury and of the
British Museum so often recur show my deep obligations to these
gentlemen and to Dr Gray and indeed to most of the British and
several Foreign collectors of recent and fossil shells At the
period when the Introduction to this volume was printed I stated that
I did not know whether the Palontographical Society would publish
the few British fossil Balanid the Council has now honoured me by
determining on this publication so that these species will hereafter
be more fully illustrated than they could be in the present volume I
cannot conclude this short preface without again tendering my most
grateful thanks to the Council of the Ray Society for the publication
of my two volumes and for the very kind manner in which they have
acceded to all my requests

DOWN KENT July 

     I feel under special obligation to Mr Dana for several very
    interesting communications connected with the present subject and
    for information derived from his magnificent work on the Crustacea
    collected during the United States Exploring Expedition Also
    to M Bosquet of Maestricht for the loan and gift of several
    interesting fossils described and illustrated with the utmost
    fidelity in his beautiful Monographie des Crustacs fossiles du

ON

THE CIRRIPEDIA




INTRODUCTION


My former volume published by the Ray Society treated only of the
Lepadid one family of the Cirripedia I was induced to print it
from having the materials ready though this partial publication has
been in some respects inconvenient The Palontographical Society has
done me the honour to publish with ample illustrations the fossil
species of this same family of Lepadid This present volume completes
my work on the subclass Cirripedia I had originally intended to
have published a small volume on my anatomical observations but the
full abstract given in my former volume which will be illustrated to a
certain extent in the plates appended to this volume together with the
observations here given under the Balanid appear to me sufficient
and I am unwilling to spend more time on the subject In the volume on
the Lepadid I gave the specific or diagnostic characters in English
and Latin I have here left out the latter inasmuch as I have appended
at the end of this volume a Latin Synopsis of all the species recent
and fossil of the whole class To each species is added a reference
to the pages and plates of my three volumes so that the Synopsis
will serve as a systematic index to the three an alphabetical index
to the present volume is also given In the Lepadid I gave an
additional specific character derived from the softer parts of the
animals body in the Balanid these parts are more alike in the
different species and I have found it impossible to give a diagnostic
character thus derived In those cases in which a Family contains but
one genus or a Genus but one species I have assigned my reasons for
the institution of such groups but have given as heretofore only a
single description in full it would have been easy to have separated
by analogy this description into one for the species another for
the genus or for the family but as I believe such separation and
subordination of the characters would have been largely conjectural
I have thought it best to act as I have done and give thus saving
useless repetitions only a single description and leave it for my
successors when more genera or species are known to separate with
such certainty as is ever possible the generic from the specific
characters

     The number of the British fossil species of the Balanid and
    Verrucid in a recognisable state is so small that I do not
    know whether it will be considered worth while to publish in the
    Palontographical series more detailed illustrations than are given
    in this volume

In nomenclature I have endeavoured rigorously to follow the rules
of the British Association and have never at least intentionally
broken through the great law of priority In accordance with the rules
I have rejected that is as compulsory all names given before the
introduction of the binomial system in  I have given much fewer
synonyms than is usual in conchological works for it is impossible to
recognise with any approach to certainty several even of the common
European forms in the short descriptions given by most authors this
holds good in many cases in which figures in appearance excellent
have been added I assert this the more confidently from having had
the advantage of having gone over some of the Linnean synonyms with Mr
S Hanley I may further venture to express my conviction that giving
references to works in which there is not any original matter or in
which the plates are not of a high order of excellence is absolutely
injurious to the progress of natural history

Sessile Cirripedes partly from being attached to surfaces having
very different characters partly from undergoing a varying amount of
disintegration and partly from unknown innate causes are extremely
variable Under the head of Variation in the Family Balanid and
under the Genus Balanus I have enlarged on this subject and have
shown that there is scarcely a single external character which is not
highly variable in most of the species As whole groups of specimens
often vary in exactly the same manner it is not easy to exaggerate the
difficulty of discriminating species and varieties It is absolutely
necessary in most cases for mere identification that the valves of at
least one specimen in a group should be disarticulated and well cleaned
for which purpose caustic potash is most useful so that the internal
characters may be examined Whoever attempts to make out from external
characters alone without disarticulating the valves the species
even those inhabiting one very confined region for instance the
shores of Great Britain will almost certainly fall into many errors
hence it is and can thus only be accounted for that I have not seen
one collection of British specimens with all the species though so
few in number rightly discriminated and in the large majority of
cases either two or three species certainly distinct were confounded
together or two or three varieties as certainly not distinct were
separated from each other


On the Names Given to the Different Parts of Cirripedes

In my former volume I have stated that I found it indispensable in
part owing to the extreme confusion of the nomenclature previously
used to attach new names to several of the external parts of
Cirripedes Almost all these names are applicable to the Balanid
or sessile Cirripedes and to the Verrucid but a few additional
names are requisite which together with the old names will I
hope be rendered clear by the accompanying woodcuts In sessile
Cirripedes the whole of that which is externally visible may for
convenience sake be divided into the operculum or opercular valves
valv operculares and the shell testa though these parts
homologically present no real difference The operculum is seated
generally some little way down within the orifice of the shell but
in very young specimens and in Verruca the operculum is attached
to the summit of the shell and the shell without the operculum being
removed can hardly be said to have any orifice though of course the
opercular valves themselves have an aperture for the protrusion of the
cirri

The shell consists of the basis called the support by some authors
which is membranous or shelly and flat or cupformed and of the
compartments test valv which vary from eight to four in
number and occasionally are all calcified together

The compartment at that end of the shell where the cirri are exserted
through the aperture or lips of the operculum is called the carina
fig  the compartment opposite to it is the rostrumthese two
lying at the ends of the longitudinal axis of the shell Those on the
sides are the lateral compartments that nearest the carina being
the carinolateral test valva carinolateralis that nearest the
rostrum the rostrolateral and the middle one simply the lateral
compartment but these three compartments are rarely present together
The rostrolateral compartment which always resembles fig  and
may be always known by having radii on both sides is often absent and
not rarely the lateral and carinolateral compartments are confounded
together or one is absent in such cases the compartment that is left
is simply called the lateral one The compartments are separated from
each other by sutures which are often so fine and close as to be
distinguished with difficulty The edge of a compartment which can
only be seen when disarticulated from its neighbour I have called the
sutural edge acies suturalis

Each separate compartment consists of a wall paries or
parietal portion pp in woodcuts which always grows downwards
and forms the basal margin and is furnished on the two sides either
with al fig  or with radii fig  or with an ala on one
side and a radius fig  on the other

The radius adopting the name used by Bruguire Lamarck and
others differs remarkably in appearance though not in essence from
the walls or parietal portion owing to the direction of the lines
of growth and the state of its usually depressed surface In the
upper part the radii overlie the al of the adjoining compartments
in outline r fig    they are wedgeformed with their
points downwards their summits and this is often a useful specific
character are either parallel to the basis or as in fig  and 
oblique The radii are sometimes not developed

     The radii have been called by Ranzani and De Blainville
    are depress the parietal portions of the compartments being
    the are prominentes by Poli are interject by Gray
    sutures by Coldstream compartments of the second order the
    parietal portions being those of the first order by some authors
    as intersticia I may here add that the scuta are the ventral
    valves of Gray the anterior of Ranzani and the inferior
    opercular of De Blainville the terga are the posterior valves
    of Gray and Ranzani but the superior opercular of De Blainville
    the rostrum on the other hand is the anterior valve of Ferussac
    and the ventral of De Blainville the carina being the dorsal
    valve of the latter author

The al so called by Dr Gray are overlapped by the radii and by
part of the walls they usually extend only about half way down the
compartment a fig    their summits are either parallel to
the basis or oblique The al of the several compartments together
with the internal upper thickened surfaces of the walls against a
shoulder of which the sutural edges of the al abut have been called
by Dr Gray the sheath vagina The upper and greater portion of
the sheath is marked by transverse lines caused by the exuviation of
the opercular membrane as that membrane may be called which unites
the operculum all round to the sheath or upper internal surface of the
shell

The carina has always two al as in fig 

The carinolateral and lateral compartments have always an ala on
one the rostral side and a radius on the other the carinal side
as in fig 

The rostrolateral compartment when present has always radii on
both sides as in fig 

The rostrum has normally al on both sides as in fig  but very
often from fusion with the rostrolateral compartments on both sides
it has radii on both sides as in fig 

The walls of the shell the basis and the radii are in very many
cases composed of an outer and inner lamina united together by
longitudinal septa a set of tubes or pores being thus formed The
points of the longitudinal septa generally project beyond the lamin
and are denticulated on both sides see woodcut further on the septa
are sometimes branched several irregular rows of pores between the two
lamin being then formed see Pl  fig  b and Pl  fig 
g  h

Operculum or opercular valvesThese consist of a pair of scuta
and a pair of terga They are joined to the sheath of the shell by the
opercular membrane

Scutum woodcut  this valve is generally subtriangular and its
three margins are the basal the tergal so called from being
articulated with the tergum and the occludent so called from
opening and shutting against the opposed valve The angles are called
from the adjoining margins as basitergal c the upper angle
being the apex The scutum is ordinarily articulated to the tergum by
an articular ridge crista articularis running up to the apex
of the valve and by an articular furrow which latter receives the
scutal margin of the tergum The articular ridge instead of projecting
straight up from the valve when laid flat on its external surface
often bends over to the tergal side and is then said to be reflexed
On the internal surface of the valve there is almost always an
adductor pit or cavity fossa adductoris for the attachment of
the adductor scutorum muscle this pit is often bounded on its tergal
and basal sides by a ridge called the adductor ridge crista
adductoris which in its upper part is often confluent with the
articular ridge Beneath the adductor ridge in the basitergal corner
of the valve there is often a lateraldepressor pit fossa musculi
lateralis depressoris for the attachment of the socalled muscle
and this pit is sometimes furnished with crests

Tergum woodcut  and this valve also has three margins
the scutal basal and carinal its upper end or apex is
sometimes beaked on the basal margin a spur calcar depends
the outer surface of the valve is depressed or longitudinally
furrowed sulcus longitudinalis in the line of the spur The
part called the spur is often so broad that the name becomes not very
appropriate The angles are denominated from the adjoining margins
as basicarinal or basiscutal angle c On the under side in
the upper part there is an articular ridge and on its scutal side
an articular furrow receiving the articular ridge of the scutum In
the basicarinal corner of the valve there are often crests for the
attachment of the tergal depressor muscle

Sack Body Cirri MouthA slitlike orifice between the
opercular valves leads into the sack in which the body is lodged
The body consists of the six perhaps the seven posterior thoracic
segments of the archetype Crustacean the first of these six segments
or first two if there be seven segments is developed on its dorsal
aspect into a part which I have called the prosoma see fig 
c Pl  There is no abdomen The thoracic segments support six
pairs of cirri Each cirrus consists of a twojointed pedicel
carrying two multiarticulated rami Rarely there are articulated
caudal appendages appendices caudales on each side of the anus
The prominent mouth consists of a labrum palpi mandibles
maxill and outer maxill the latter resembling a lower lip
these organs may be conveniently spoken of after Milne Edwards as
gnathites Within the sack attached to its carinolateral end a
folded membrane forms the branchi The sheets of ova lying within
the sack are called the ovigerous lamell

     A discussion on the homologies of the different parts is given
    under the head of the Metamorphoses of the Balanid

I have often found it convenient to designate the membrane investing
the body lining the sack c by its proper chemical name of
chitine instead of by horny or other such equivalents but when
covering parts of the shell for brevitys sake I have often spoken of
it as an epidermis but I do not believe that such is its nature
When this membrane sends into the body of the animal rigid projections
or crests for the attachment of muscles or any other purpose I call
them after Audouin apodemes For the underlying true skin I use
the term corium

Relative position of partsThe centre of the generally flat
basis which is cemented to the supporting surface is properly the
anterior end and the tips of the terga often hidden within the
shell are properly the posterior end of the external covering but
I have found it more convenient to speak of the upper and basal
surfaces and aspects which hardly admit of any mistake A line drawn
from the centre of the basis along the middle of the rostrum to the
tips of the scuta shows the strictly medioventral surface of the
shell and another line drawn from the centre of the basis along the
carina to the tips of the terga shows the strictly mediodorsal
line but from the crooked course of these lines I have found it far
more convenient to speak of the rostral and carinal end or aspect
of the different parts of the shell this is the more necessary with
respect to the internal parts of the animal owing to their remarkable
changes of position during the metamorphosis whence it comes that the
dorsal surface of the thorax faces partly dorsally partly anteriorly
or downwards and partly even ventrally and the ventral surface of the
whole posterior part of the thorax faces upwards or posteriorly but
when we refer these parts to the rostral carinal basal and
upper ends of the shell there can be no mistake There has moreover
been great confusion in these relative terms as applied by different
authors

When a sessile Cirripede is held in the position in which they have
generally been figured namely with the basis downwards and the
scuta towards the beholder then the right and left sides of the
Cirripede correspond with those of the holder

I have followed the example of Botanists and added the interjection
 to synonyms when I have seen an authentic specimen bearing the
name in question

Every locality under each species is given from specimens ticketed
in a manner and under circumstances appearing to me worthy of
confidencethe specific determination being in each case made by
myself




CLASSCRUSTACEA

SubClassCIRRIPEDIA

Crustacea attached by the anterior end of the head by cement
proceeding from a modified portion of the ovaria archetype composed
of seventeen segments with the three first of large size and almost
always developed into a carapace not wholly exuviated and capable of
various movements antenn none eyes rudimentary mouth prominent
formed by the partial confluence of the labrum palpi mandibles and
two pairs of maxill thorax attached to the internal sternal surface
of the carapace generally bearing six pairs of captorial biramous
multiarticulated limbs abdomen generally rudimentary branchi
when present attached to the under sides of the carapace generally
bisexual when unisexual males epizoic on the female penis single
generally probosciformed seated at the posterior end of the abdomen
oviducts none metamorphoses complex


Within the memory of many living naturalists Cirripedes were
universally looked on as belonging to the Molluscous kingdom nor was
this surprising considering the fixed condition of their shells and
the degree of external resemblance between on the one hand Lepas and
Teredo and on the other hand between Balanus and a Mollusc compounded
of a patella and chiton It is remarkable that this external false
appearance overbore even in the mind of Cuvier his knowledge of their
internal structure namely their lateral jaws articulated appendages
and regular ganglionic nervous system which now strike us as such
conclusive evidence of their position in the great Articulate kingdom
Straus was I believe the first who in  maintained that
Cirripedes were most closely allied to Crustacea But this view was
disregarded until J Vaughan Thompsons capital discovery in 
of their metamorphoses since which time Cirripedes have been almost
universally admitted amongst the Crustaceans It is well known that
it is hardly possible to give a definition of this great class which
shall include every member of it nevertheless even if the mature
Cirripede alone be considered the following characters viz the
slight separation of the head and thorax the latter generally bearing
six pairs of appendages and the being enclosed in a carapacetogether
with the periodical exuviation of the greater part of the external
membranes would perhaps suffice to show that it should be classed
amongst Crustacea

     Mmoires du Musum dHistoire Nat tom v p 

     Zoological Researches and Illustrations

But it still remains undecided what rank in this class Cirripedes
should hold Before briefly discussing this point it is indispensable
to indicate their essential characters which I will immediately
attempt For as long as it remained doubtful which was their anterior
extremity which the ventral or dorsal surface as long as the peduncle
was thought by one naturalist to be the legs by another the abdomen
in a modified condition it was hopeless to compare Cirripedes with
ordinary Crustaceans and assign to them their due rank

In the larva in the first stage an eye and two pairs of antenn are
in process of formation or are developed here then according to
the analogy of all Crustaceans we have evidence of the existence of
the first three cephalic segments The mouth always consists of three
pairs of gnathites and hence again from analogy this part may be
inferred to be formed of and supported on three other segments
making thus far six segments In two Orders out of the three into
which Cirripedes may be divided namely in the Abdominalia and Apoda
eight quite distinct segments succeed the mouth of these the first
differs slightly from the seven succeeding segments and may I think
be safely considered as forming the seventh cephalic segment The
next seven segments resemble each other in all essential respects and
are no doubt the normal seven thoracic segments These in both the
above orders are succeeded by three smaller segments which differ
in structure from the thoracic segments and must be abdominal Hence
we here have altogether seventeen segments It should however be
observed that in the two orders just referred to each includes only
a single species but I know of no good reason why on this account
their structure should be valued the less In the third order the
Thoracica which includes all common Cirripedes two segments with
their appendages are missing out of the eight that should succeed
the mouth from the open interval in the pupa between the mouth and
first pair of natatory legs and from some other reasons I believe
that the two missing segments are the seventh and eighth or last
cephalic and first thoracic segments and that they have coalesced
close posteriorly to the mouth In the order Thoracica the abdomen
is quite rudimentary though often still bearing caudal appendages
in the pupa however of this order as in the mature animal of the
two other orders it is formed of three segments Hence I conclude
that notwithstanding the absence of the above two segments with their
appendages in the Thoracica the archetype Cirripede may be safely said
to be composed of seventeen segments

     This question and the whole subject of the homologies of the
    several parts of a Cirripede will be discussed under the head of
    the Metamorphoses of the Balanid

In the classification of Crustacea the relation and number of the
segments of the different parts of the body are viewed both by Prof
Milne Edwards and Mr Dana as of the highest importance
I may premise that both these authors divide the Crustacea into
Podophthalmia Edriophthalmia and Entomostraca Milne Edwards making
a fourth legion the Branchiopoda and another division including
Limulus of equal value to the above four legions altogether whereas
Dana sinks Limulus and the Branchiopoda under his Entomostraca As
far as concerns our present discussion on Cirripedes the first
three divisions as valued by Dana will best serve as standards
of comparison but it is not unimportant to our present purpose
as showing how difficult it is to weigh the value of the higher
divisions of a Class to observe the wide difference in opinion of two
naturalists so eminent for their knowledge of the class in question
and for their high abilities

     Annales des Sciences Nat tom xviii p  

     Crustacea United States Exploring Expedition p  

In the order Thoracica including all common Cirripedes the
cephalic and thoracic segments are as much confounded together but
with coalescence and abortion of two middle segments as in most
Podophthalmia but in the two other orders the cephalic and thoracic
segments are as distinct as in the Edriophthalmia The number of the
segments however which strictly appertain to the anterior part of
the head and mouth being only six is an Entomostracan character on
the other hand the first pair of cirri in the Thoracica has some
claim from their position apparent functions and separation from the
succeeding pairs to be said to belong to the mouth on which view the
first nine segments would in function be cephalic as in the highest
Crustaceans The fewness of the segments of the abdomen and their not
bearing in two of the orders appendages is an Entomostracan character

Cirripedes are permanently attached even before their final
metamorphosis by a tissue or cement first debouching through the
second pair of antenn and subsequently in most cases through
special orifices penetrating the anterior part of the head this
cement proceeds from glands which certainly are modified portions of
the ovarian system This fact I consider of the highest classificatory
importance for it is absolutely the one single character common to all
Cirripedes besides such as show only that these animals belong to the
articulated kingdom and are Crustaceans No structure of this kind has
hitherto been observed in any other member of the class or kingdom
Even in the Suctorial Entomostracans which become immoveably attached
to the fish on which they prey the males are free and the means of
attachment as far as known are quite different

Both the first and second pairs of antenn are absent in the mature
animal for the three terminal segments of the antenn of the pupa
which may always be found cemented under the centre of the surface of
attachment are functionless after maturity The eyes are rudimentary
and are singular from being seated far from the anterior extremity of
the head In their rudimentary state and in the absence of antenn we
have characters common with certain Suctorial Entomostracans and this
similarity apparently arises from the fixed condition of the animals
of both groups

The carapace which covers the dorsal surface of the larva in the first
stage in the last larval or pupal stage is developed so as to enclose
like a bivalve shell the whole body In the mature Cirripede the
whole external covering whether shell and operculum or capitulum and
peduncle can be conclusively shown to be the carapace of the pupa
modified In thus enclosing the mouth and whole body the modified
carapace resembles that of several Entomostracans but in being
apparently formed as I hope hereafter to show by the development
of the third segment of the head and in consisting generally of
distinct sclerodermic plates arranged in an imbricated order there
is I think a closer resemblance to the same part in some of the
Podophthalmia The carapace or portions of the carapace being capable
of other movements besides merely opening and shutting differs I
believe from that of all other Crustaceans as it likewise does in
the greater part not being periodically moulted

     The carapace however of the Isaura a Branchiopod according
    to M Joly Annales des Sc Nat  ser vol xvii p  is
    not moulted

Moreover in all Cirripedes there is another striking peculiarity
connected with these parts namely the exclusive attachment of the
whole thorax or included body to the internal ventral or sternal
surface of the carapace and head In the pupa the thorax as in all
Crustaceans opens into and is continuously united with the large
anterior part of the head but from the singular fact that the thorax
of the young Cirripede is developed not within the thorax but within
the head of the pupa Pl  fig  with its longitudinal axis
placed at right angles to that which it held in the pupal condition
the mouth and the whole exterior being developed conformably with
that of the pupa it comes to pass after the metamorphosis that the
Cirripede is as it were internally cut in twain compare Pl  fig
 and Pl  figs  and  Thus it is as will hereafter be more
fully explained that the sack originates and thus the body becomes
attached to the internal ventral surface of the carapace and front of
head

The thorax in two of the Orders bears no appendages but in all common
Cirripedes it is furnished with six pairs of biramous multiarticulated
cirri which have a peculiar character different from the limbs of
other Crustaceans not being natatory ambulatory or branchial
but captorial or fitted for sweeping the water and thus catching
prey The cirri at least the anterior pairs can besides other
movements lengthen and shorten themselves and this Milne Edwards
states is the case with the Podophthalmia and is considered by him
as an important character The cirri of the first pair are attached
on each side close to the bases of the mandibles and as already
remarked have some claim to be considered as maxillipeds or mouth
organs The three or the four posterior pairs of cirri in the Balanid
form a series somewhat distinct from the two or three anterior pairs
thus recalling a characteristic feature in the Edriophthalmia

     M A Hancock in Annals and Magazine of Natural History d
    series  p  speaks of the cirri acting like a prehensile
    net

     Annales des Sciences Nat tom xviii p  

The mouth is prominent and is formed by the partial confluence of the
labrum palpi and lower segments of the mandibles and of two pairs of
maxill it is capable of movement as a whole in this respect we are
reminded of the Suctorial Entomostracans but I believe the above type
of structure of the mouth is peculiar to Cirripedes

The alimentary canal is simple but can be distinctly divided
intost an sophagus singular from the bellshaped expansion
of its lower end d the stomach which is directed forwards and
then doubled back and d the rectum There is no distinct liver
The circulation is lacunal In one family there are welldeveloped
branchi which differ entirely in their homologies and position
from these organs in all other Crustaceans In the nervous system
the subsophageal ganglions vary in concentration from that degree
observed in the lower Macroura to that in the highest Brachyoura but
the suprasophageal ganglions are always much less concentrated and
are even embryonic in condition presenting a difference not observed
in other Crustaceans On the under side of the subsophageal ganglion
two nerves apparently splanchnic arise and run almost parallel and
under the collar surrounding the sophagus they are very remarkable
from their great size and from forming a plexus together with a
large branch arising on each side from the collar close behind the
suprasophageal gangliona structure unlike anything observed in
other Crustaceans The eyes as already remarked are rudimentary and
singular from being imbedded at a distance from the anterior end of the
animal In the basal confluent segments of the outer maxill there are
two orifices leading into little sacks which I believe are olfactory
organs again there are two other orifices on each side of the thorax
beneath the first pair of cirri leading into sacks with a curious
elastic vesicle suspended within them and these I can hardly doubt are
acoustic organs Of these orifices and organs there is no trace in the
same relative positions in any known Crustacean

Cirripedes are ordinarily bisexual in which they differ from all
Crustaceans when the sexes are separate the males are minute
rudimentary in structure and permanently epizoic on the females to
these latter facts we have a partial analogy in some of the Suctorial
Entomostracans but a far closer analogy in certain Rotifers which are
considered by many naturalists as Crustaceans but to the above subject
I shall almost immediately have to recur

The male excretory organ is probosciformed and capable of the most
varied movements it is single and medial it is seated in the one
instance in which this point can be safely judged of at the extremity
of the abdomen and therefore near the normal position of the anus
in all these respects there is a very great difference from other
Crustaceans in which the male organs are laterally double and are not
seated at the extremity of the abdomen In regard to the female organs
the ovarian tubes and cca inosculate together there are no oviducts
the ova connected together by membrane and so forming the ovigerous
lamell become exposed by the exuviation of the lining tunic of the
carapace or sack and by the formation of a new tunic on the under side
of these lamell a process I believe unknown in other Crustaceans

The metamorphoses are highly complex The larva in its first stage
bears a very close general resemblance in having three pairs of
natatory appendages the first being uniramous and the two others
biramous and in having a single eye on its broad anterior front to
the larv of most Entomostracans but I cannot avoid the belief that
this resemblance is only apparent and not essential and of false
resemblances how many instances occur in the animal kingdom In the
larva when first freed from the egg both pairs of antenn are in
process of formation within envelopes the mouth is probosciformed
and capable of movement but is destitute of gnathites it occupies a
position between the three pairs of natatory limbs and these limbs I
must believe for reasons hereafter to be assigned answer improbable
as I am well aware it must at first appear to the second third
and fourth thoracic legs of the archetype Crustacean the two hinder
pairs of limbs apparently soon become captorial or fitted to secure
prey Now I cannot find in the published accounts of the larv of
Entomostracans any that answer to this description

The larva in the last stage might be included in the vast class of
Entomostracans the attachment of the eyes to the singular apodemes
produced inwards from the basal segment of the great prehensile
antenn and the development of only the posterior six pairs of
thoracic limbs are its chief peculiarities but its rudimentary mouth
owing to its transitional or pupal condition renders the assignment of
its proper rank difficult

                                   

Having now given this short comparative sketch of the structure of
a Cirripede I may venture to express strongly my opinion that the
group is formed on a distinct type as different from the other
three or four main Crustacean groups namely the Podophthalmia
Edriophthalmia Branchiopoda and Entomostraca as these differ from
each other the differences moreover being of the kind considered
by the highest authorities on this subject as the most important It
should be observed that there is no special blending at either end of
the Cirripedial series towards any one of the other main groups of
Crustacea it is hardly possible to take some one Cirripede and say
that it leads more plainly than some other Cirripede into ordinary
Crustaceans Moreover a great range of structure as we shall soon
briefly show is included within the group I can adduce three or four
undoubted Cirripedes very considerably more different from each other
than any two members within the subclass Podophthalmia or within the
Edriophthalmia or the Branchiopoda and quite as different as within
the Entomostraca

The opinion here expressed that Cirripedes form a subclass of equal
value with the other main Crustacean groups I am well pleased to find
accords with Mr Danas view who remarks that this subclass
has so many peculiarities of structure that it should be regarded
as a distinct type rather than a subordinate division of the third
or Entomostracan type M Milne Edwards after dividing all
Crustacea into two groups divides one of them into four legions
and of one of these the Entomostraca he makes the Cirripedes a
subgroup I feel so entire a deference for any opinion on affinities
or classification expressed by Milne Edwards that I differ from
him with the greatest hesitation He does not give his reasons for
assigning so subordinate a rank to Cirripedes but I imagine it is from
the nature of their metamorphoses but if this be the case I cannot
understand why he should assign to his Branchiopods a rank equal to his
Entomostracans Moreover I must repeat that I do not believe that
the larv do resemble the larv of Entomostracans and Branchiopods
nearly so closely as at first appears to be the case I may add that
Burmeister has assigned to the Cirripedes a place amongst the
Crustacea almost equally subordinate to that given to them by Milne
Edwards

     Beitrge zur Naturgesehichte der Rankenfsser 

That Cirripedes have some special affinity to the Entomostraca may
be inferred from the fewness of the cephalic appendages the biramous
legs the state of the abdomen and the form of the carapace Perhaps
in the peculiar state of confluence of the lower segments of the
gnathites in the aborted antenn the rudimentary eyes and in the
minute parasitic males when such exist there is a more direct
relation to the Suctorial division of the Entomostraca but some of
these resemblances are probably only analogical resulting from the
fixed condition of both groups It should not be overlooked that
out of the three orders into which Cirripedes may be divided in
the two latter the mature animal presents hardly any resemblance
to an Entomostracan From the distinct presence in either pupa or
mature animal of the fourteen segments of the cephalothorax from
the apparent composition of the carapace as will be subsequently
explained and from the concentrated condition of the nervous system
one is led to glance at the higher Crustacea and here we shall find
amongst the Podophthalmia one aberrant group of low organisation
namely that including Phyllosoma Amphion c in which more points
of resemblance to Cirripedes may be detected than as I believe in
any other group whatever for we here see that remarkable elongation
of the head in front of the mouth so eminently characteristic of
Cirripedes we have a carapace overlapping the thorax which is
sometimes free beneath we have the abdomen sometimes almost obsolete
we have biramous legs and especially we have the posterior cephalic
and the first thoracic appendages more or less rudimentary and
obsolete and this I infer from Mr Dana is a very rare phenomenon
though characteristic of all ordinary Cirripedes in which the
seventh and eighth segments with their appendages have disappeared
In the order including Phyllosoma c namely in the Macroura the
ganglions which give nerves to the five posterior thoracic limbs are
distinct from the great subsophageal ganglion which supplies the
several anterior appendages this is the case with those Cirripedes in
which all the infrasophageal ganglions are not concentrated into one
In the Macroura and Brachyoura the first pair of legs almost always
differs in structure from the others so does the homologous or second
cirrus in Cirripedes differ from the four succeeding pairs in some
few Macroura the second leg is antenniformed so in some few cases is
the homologous or third cirrus J Vaughan Thompson was even struck
by the resemblance in the curious doubly pectinated spines on the
anterior limbs of Mysis allied to Phyllosoma and on those of
many Cirripedes these several latter resemblances may be small but
certainly I do not believe that they are accidental Now the little
group of Crustaceans which includes Phyllosoma c has lately
been placed by Milne Edwards as a satellite amongst the Macrourous
Podophthalmia it leads into the Stomopoda and likewise as has been
noticed by many authors into the subclass Branchiopoda which latter
subclass is considered by Mr Dana as only a part of the Entomostraca
this group therefore exhibits affinities radiating in several
directions and amongst these lines of relationship one more must I
believe be added plainly directed towards the Cirripedia

     M Martin St Ange Mmoire sur lOrgan des Cirripdes
     extrait des Savans Etrangers tom vi has compared the
    mouth of Lepas with that of Phyllosoma and has given comparative
    figures but the resemblance is founded I believe on quite false
    homologies

One naturally wishes to ascertain how far Cirripedia are highly or
lowly organised and developed but in all cases this as it seems to
me is a very obscure enquiry Mr Dana considers that in Crustacea
the greater or less centralisation of all the appendages round the
mouth is the main sign of high development on this view the anterior
part of a Cirripede from being so much elongated must be considered
as very low in the scale the whole posterior part of the body on the
other hand is in ordinary Cirripedes brought close to the mouth but
this is effected by the abortion of the seventh and eighth segments of
the cephalothorax and of the whole abdomen and so I presume would
not in Mr Danas estimation raise the class much in the scale Von
Baer considers that the perfection of the type of any animal is in
relation to the amount of morphological differentiation which it has
undergone on this view Cirripedes ought to stand high in the scale
for they differ much morphologically from the type of the class to
which they belong as indeed is shown by the long time that elapsed
before their true position namely amongst the Crustacea was even
suspected but something more must I think be added to Von Baers
definition for to take as an example the eyes of a Cirripedeas
seen in the first larval stage there is only one eye and that most
simple in the pupa there are two both compound and furnished with
complicated muscles lastly in the mature animal there are still
two but of very minute size often almost confluent and of the
simplest structure hence then there has been much morphological
differentiation but it is almost a contradiction in terms to speak in
relation to such a case of perfection of type and what has happened
to one organ might happen to other organs and so to the whole animal
Lastly under a physiological point of view and taking the Balanid as
the most perfect type of the class the subsophageal portion of the
nervous system is highly concentrated the organs of sense excepting
the eyes seem more largely developed than in ordinary Crustaceans the
circulating system is of the simplest kind being only lacunal special
Branchi however are developed by the metamorphosis of as I believe
a special organ occurring only in the Lepadid the digestive organs
are very simple from not having any distinct liver the generative
system is very low for both sexes are generally united in the same
individual and the testes and ovaria closely resemble each other
On the other hand the thoracic limbs are to a considerable extent
specialised in their structure and functions only the three posterior
pairs strictly resembling each other Lastly the dermal and muscular
systems are complicated and not to use Professor Owens term by mere
vegetative repetition as will be obvious to any one who will study the
beautifully constructed and modified carapacethat is the operculum
shell and basisof a Balanus On the whole I look at a Cirripede
as a being of a low type which has undergone much morphological
differentiation and which has in some few lines of structure arrived
at considerable perfectionmeaning by the terms perfection and
lowness some vague resemblance to animals universally considered of a
higher rank

It has been seen that I divide the Cirripedia into three ordersthe
Thoracica Abdominalia and Apoda between which the fundamental
difference consists in the limbs or cirri being thoracic in the first
abdominal in the second and entirely absent in the third For the sake
of showing the range of character in Cirripedes to which allusion has
been made I will briefly indicate the leading differences in each
order In the Thoracica three families are includedthe Balanid
or sessile Cirripedes the Verrucid remarkable from their quite
asymmetrical shell and the Lepadid or pedunculated Cirripedes The
great difference in external appearance between these three families is
known to all naturalists Even within the one family of Lepadid there
are great differences in external appearance as will be admitted on
comparison of Lepas Pollicipes Conchoderma c but we have also
important internal differences as in the case of Anelasma in which
the cirri are barely articulated and are not capable of seizing prey
whilst the mouth is almost probosciformed with the outer maxill
and palpi rudimentary still more important are the differences in
Alcippe in which the cirri of the first pair act as brushes the
second third and fourth pairs being quite aborted and the fifth and
sixth pairs consist only of four segments with one of the two normal
rami converted into a crenated buttonlike projection for the sake
apparently of triturating food Alcippe also is very remarkable in
being destitute of a rectum and anus In this same genus Alcippe in
Ibla and Scalpellum there are either separate males or Complemental
males some of which are so utterly abnormal in their characters that
by no definition which I could frame could they be included even in
their proper Order much less in their proper Family

In the second order of Abdominalia Pl  and  the seventh or last
cephalic segment is quite distinct and bears rudimentary organs
answering to the first pair of maxillipeds of ordinary Crustaceans of
which organs and of the segment supporting them there is no trace in
the Thoracica the seven succeeding thoracic segments are destitute
of any appendages but the three segments of the abdomen bear three
pairs of cirri The mouth is peculiar in the labrum being developed
into very large moveable lancetformed organ and the lower end of
the sophagus is armed with beautiful discs of teeth and brushes of
hairsa structure confined to this order The male resembles the
male of Alcippe and the latter genus seems to be the connecting link
between the Thoracica and Abdominalia But the most important character
of this latter order in which it differs from Alcippe and all other
known Cirripedes is in its metamorphoses all the first changes are
merely indicated by changes in form in an egglike larva without the
development of distinct organs and the last or pupal condition which
is attained within the sack of the parent is very peculiar by the
entire absence of natatory limbs

The third order of Apoda is the most peculiar of all it contains
like the last only one known species the most acute naturalist I
am convinced if he had not made the class his special study would
never even have suspected that this animal was a Cirripede We see
much magnified in Pl  fig  a naked plainlyarticulated animal
resembling the larva or maggot of a fly attached by two threads
and these threads on analysis can be clearly shown to be the last
rudiment of the carapace specially modified The last cephalic the
seven thoracic and the three abdominal segments are all equally
destitute of appendages The mouth is suctorial and constructed on a
plan unlike I believe anything known in the articulate kingdom for
the mandibles and maxill have rotated on their axes and stand back
to back they can act only by tearing open a slit and this action is
performed in a hood formed by the confluence of the broad palpi and
labrum Although the sophagus is distinct there is no stomach or
anus Lastly owing to there being no carapace the ova are developed
differently from in all other Cirripedes within the thorax

I will close this preliminary discussion on the confines and type of
the subclass by recalling attention now that a sketch has been given
of the three Orders to the remark before made that a wide range of
structure is included within it and by reurging that the Cirripedia
should be ranked not as one of the subordinate groups but as one of
the main divisions of the Crustacea


On the Sexual Relation of Cirripedes

Cirripedes are commonly bisexual or hermaphrodite but in Ibla
Scalpellum and Alcippe members of the Lepadid in the order
Thoracica and in Cryptophialus in the order Abdominalia the sexes
are separate As two of these genera were described in my former
volume and two others Alcippe and Cryptophialus are described in
this volume I may as well here give a brief summary of the facts as
yet known on this very curious subject The Males in the above four
genera present a wonderful range of structure they are attached in
the usual way by cement proceeding from the notmoulted antenn of the
pupa to different parts in the different species of the female
These males are minute often exceedingly minute and consequently
generally more than one is attached to a single female and I have
seen as many as fourteen adhering on one female In several species
the males are shortlived for they cannot feed being destitute of a
mouth and stomach As the females are longer lived successive crops
of males at each period of propagation become attached to her
It is the females in the above genera which retain the characters
of the genus family and order to which they belong the males
often departing widely from the normal type Some of the males are
rudimentary to a degree which I believe can hardly be equalled in the
whole animal kingdom they may in fact be said to exist as mere bags
of spermatozoa So widely do some of them depart in every character
from their class that twice it has happened to me to examine specimens
with a little care and not even to suspect until a long period
afterwards that these males were Cirripedes

     In my volume on the Lepadid p  in searching for
    analogies for the permanently epizoic and rudimentary condition
    of the male Cirripedes I quoted two cases which I believe are
    now known not to be analogous namely the Syngamus trachealis
    of Von Siebold and the wormlike Hectocotyle which latter was
    quite lately supposed to be a male Cephalopod but has now been
    ascertained to be only one of the arms of the male wonderfully
    adapted and organised as a spermreceptacle The Asplanchna the
    mouthless male of a Rotifer p  alone remains for me

In Scalpellum Peronii and villosum the males are but little
abnormal for if classified independently of their sexual relations
they would be considered as immature specimens of a new genus standing
next to Scalpellum in Scalpellum rostratum the male would form
another and rather more distinct genus The males in the latter are
attached to the other sex between the basal edge of the labrum and
the adductor scutorum muscle but in S Peronii and villosum they
are attached lower down in the furrow between the two scuta and are
thus protected in these three species the internal parts of the male
present nothing particular In Ibla the males are attached low down
within the sack of the female they may be said to consist of a mouth
surmounted on a long peduncle for there is no capitulum or general
covering and the whole thorax is in a rudimentary condition the cirri
being reduced to two distorted pairs As these males certainly moult
several times and grow a little they must feed and as they have no
cirri fit for action they must seize their food by the contortions of
their peduncle which we know homologically consists of the three first
segments of the head The movements of the peduncle must also supply
those of the probosciformed penis almost invariably present with other
Cirripedes but here absent If compelled to class these males without
regard to the female great difficulty would be experienced we could
hardly place in the family of the Lepadid a Cirripede without a
capitulum and without cirri those very organs which give their name
to the class and with a thorax reduced to the dimensions of a lower
lip yet if the presence of a peduncle did determine the classifier to
place these males amongst the Lepadid then undoubtedly the character
of the mouth c would fix their position next to Ibla

The males of Scalpellum vulgare ornatum and rutilum resemble
each other in all essential points and differ wonderfully in
appearance and structure from all ordinary Cirripedes They consist of
a minute flattened bag with a small orifice at the summit and at the
lower end attached by the cemented pupal antenn On each side of the
orifice there is a pair of calcareous beads representing the two
scuta and two terga of ordinary Cirripedes and between the scuta a
minute black eye is generally conspicuous In S ornatum the beads I
may remark on the two sides are not equal those either on the right
or on the left side being larger than those on the opposite side so
that the animal externally is asymmetrical Inside within a tubular
sack the thorax is lodged supporting four instead of six pairs
of limbs and these instead of forming biramous multiarticulated
captorial cirri are reduced to almost a rudiment supporting a few
long sharp spines which apparently act only as defensive organs At
the end of the thorax there is seated a large abdominal lobe which
does not occur in the other sex Hence the thorax though rudimental
has been specially modified Of the mouth and stomach there is not a
vestige Constructed as these males are assuredly they have no claim
to be ranked amongst the Lepadid or pedunculated Cirripedes nor is it
possible to class them in any group whatever of ordinary Cirripedes
In S vulgare the males are attached often several together to the
extreme edges of the two scuta and therefore immediately over the
orifice leading into the sack in S rutilum and ornatum they are
attached in concavities on the under side of both scuta just above the
depression for the adductor scutorum muscle In the former of these
species the pit for the reception of the male is formed by shelly
matter not having been deposited over a certain space on the under side
of the valve and the pit is converted by a covering of membrane into
a pouch As there are two scuta so there are two pouches in each of
which a male is lodged hence according to the Linnean nomenclature
Scalpellum ornatum may be said to belong to Diandria monogynia As
these males from being mouthless soon die they are succeeded by
successive pairs the pupa being led by a wonderful instinct to crawl
into the pouch and there undergo its metamorphosis

Lastly the males of Alcippe and Cryptophialus Pl  fig  and
Pl  fig  are remarkable for their similarity to each other
considering the essential dissimilarity of the two females The females
live in cavities which they excavate in the shells of Molluscs and
within which they are attached by a horny disc this disc is the only
part of the outer integument which is not frequently moulted and
apparently in consequence the males are attached to its edges It
results from this position that the males are protected by being
enclosed within the cavity excavated by the female and it further
results that the males are attached at a considerable distance from
the orifice of the sack of the female into which the spermatozoa
have to be conveyed and to effect this the probosciformed penis is
wonderfully developed so that in Cryptophialus when fully extended
it must equal between eight and nine times the entire length of the
animal These males like those last mentioned of Scalpellum consist
of a mere bag lined by a few muscles enclosing an eye and attached
at the lower end by the pupal antenn it has an orifice at its upper
end and within it there lies coiled up like a great worm the
probosciformed penis and beneath it a single testis with a single
vesicula seminalis These organs complete the whole organisation of the
male for there is no mouth no stomach no thorax no abdomen and
no appendages or limbs of any kind Yet all these parts are present
in the female I know of no other instance in the animal kingdom
of such an amount of abortion The whole exterior of these males
evidently is composed as in all ordinary Cirripedes of the three
first cephalic segments of the fourteen succeeding segments of the
archetype Cirripede we have not a vestige excepting the probosciformed
penis which from analogy should arise from the ventral apex of
the seventeenth segment the first three segments of the head being
counted in the seventeen Here then fourteen out of seventeen
segments have aborted the tip of the seventeenth having coalesced with
the third cephalic segment I am tempted just to notice the case of
Proteolepas in the order Apoda as showing within the limits of the
same subclass a wonderful amount and diversity in abortion for in
Proteolepas the three anterior cephalic segments are reduced to the
merest rudiment encasing the cementducts the fourteen succeeding
segments being unusually well developed whereas in the above described
males we have just seen the three anterior segments fully developed
whilst the fourteen succeeding segments are lost or have coalesced
with the others so that within the same subclass all seventeen
segments of the archetype have almost disappeared

It may be asked how I know that the several above described rudimentary
epizoons are really the males of the Cirripedes to which they are
attached Even if the whole course of the metamorphoses had not been
known in three of the cases the mere fact of these epizoons being
cemented by the three terminal segments of their peculiar pupal
antenn would have been sufficient to have shown that they belonged
to the class of Cirripedes In nearly every case I was able to
demonstrate and not in one or two but in many specimens that these
epizoons were males and as in several instances the spermatozoa
were developed and as notwithstanding in no instance was there a
vestige of ova or ovaria it may safely be concluded that they were not
hermaphrodites and therefore required females of some kind If these
epizoic Cirripedes had been independent animals as they all belong
to the same subclass and all have such peculiar habits it might
have been expected that they would have shown some special affinity
towards each other but this is not the case the epizoon of Ibla is
more nearly related to Ibla and the epizoon of Scalpellum more nearly
related to Scalpellum than are these epizoons to each other If the
several epizoons were classed by themselves they would be grouped in
divisions corresponding with those of the Cirripedes on which they are
attached which is just what might have been expected if these latter
were their females There are also many special relations between
the male epizoons and the Cirripedes to which they are attached thus
the mouth of the epizoon of Ibla is so like the mouth of Ibla which
is peculiar in several respects that I should easily have recognised
it as belonging to a member of that genus Scalpellum villosum is
remarkable as one out of only two or three members of the whole Family
which is destitute of caudal appendages so is its male epizoon again
S villosum is unusually spinose so is its male epizoon on the
other hand Scalpellum ornatum is remarkably smooth so is its male
epizoon and I could give other similar instances Will it be believed
that these coincidences are accidental and that the epizoons have no
special or sexual relation to the Cirripedes to which they are attached

One other instance of coincident structure is so important that it
must even in this sketch be noticed the prehensile antenn of
the pupa are most important and complicated organs and differ in
the different genera of the same family they are preserved in a
functionless condition throughout life and in two instances I was able
accurately to compare these organs in the epizoon and in the Cirripede
to which it was attached and they were identical in every particular
The full force of the excessive improbability of this resemblance
and of the above coincidences in structure on the supposition of the
epizoon and its support not being sexually related will hardly be
perceived without referring to the facts given in detail in my former
volume

Lastly in the case of Cryptophialus and indirectly in that of
Alcippe the nature of the male epizoon is I think actually
demonstrated for I traced both it and the female or ordinary form of
Cryptophialus through the same several larval stages from the egg
enclosed within the sack of the female to the pupa and mature animal
Moreover if the male nature and sexual relation to the supporting
Cirripede be admitted in any one of these epizoons then so close
is the agreement in habits and to a certain extent in structure
in all the foregoing epizoons that probably no one admitting one
instance would dispute the others and further evidence would even be
superfluous Indeed had it not been for the following facts I should
not have brought forward either here in abstract or in other places
in detail so many arguments and so much evidence

I have as yet not entered in detail on the sex of the supporting
Cirripede in Cryptophialus Alcippe and in one species of Ibla I
was able to demonstrate in many specimens that all the male organs
internal and external were entirely absent and consequently that
these Cirripedes were exclusively female In Scalpellum ornatum
also there is no trace of external male organs the state of the four
dried specimens not allowing the internal organs to be examined and
there cannot be any reasonable doubt that this species likewise is
exclusively female It should be borne in mind that the male organs
external and internal are most easily discovered and that in the
above cases I had an abundant supply of excellent specimens On the
other hand in Ibla Cumingii and in four species of Scalpellum I
was able to demonstrate in the supporting Cirripede the presence of
all the male organs as well as of the female and in the vesicul
seminales of several specimens both in the Ibla and in Scalpellum
vulgare spermatozoa were contained the male organs however not
being very amply developed These species consequently are not
exclusively female but are hermaphrodite though having male epizoons
attached to them This statement I am well aware is enough at first
to cast a doubt on all that I have said but let any one reflect on
the evidence of which I have here given a summary and which has
been elsewhere given in full and I think he must admit that at least
those epizoons which are exclusively male and which are attached
to Cirripedes exclusively female are sexually related and form one
species but if he admit this he cannot possibly escape from the
conclusion that some of the other epizoons for instance that of Ibla
quadrivalvis are the males of the hermaphrodites to which they are
attachedthese epizoons not exclusively impregnating the ova of a
female but aiding the selfimpregnation of an hermaphrodite Hence I
have called these males Complemental Males to show that they do not
pair with a female but with a bisexual individual Nothing strictly
analogous is known in the animal kingdom but amongst plants in the
Linnean class Polygamia closely similar instances abound

In the series of facts now given we have one curious illustration
more to the many already known how gradually nature changes from one
condition to the otherin this case from bisexuality to unisexuality
Finally in the four genera so often named we meet the following
several cases some of them even the most diverse occurring in closely
allied species st a female with a single male rarely with two
permanently attached to her protected by her and capable of seizing
by the movements of its pedunculated body any minute animals or
substances found within her sack d a female with successive pairs
of shortlived mouthless males inhabiting pouches on each side under
her scutal valves d a female with many in one instance fourteen
shortlived males destitute of mouth thorax and appendages but
furnished with a stupendously long male organ attached to a thickened
portion of her outer integuments but lying within the cavity which
she has excavated th an hermaphrodite with a male attached within
the sack capable of feeding itself as in the first case th an
hermaphrodite with from one to three males organised like ordinary
Cirripedes and apparently capable of seizing prey in the common way
and attached between the scuta and thus protected th and lastly
an hermaphrodite with from one or two up to five or six shortlived
mouthless males like those in the second case attached in one
particular spot on each side of the orifice leading into the sack




ORDER ITHORACICA

Cirripedia having a carapace consisting either of a capitulum on a
peduncle or of an operculated shell with a basis Body formed of six
thoracic segments generally furnished with six pairs of cirri abdomen
rudimentary but often bearing caudal appendages mouth with the labrum
not capable of independent movements larva firstly uniocular with
three pairs of legs lastly binocular with six pairs of thoracic
legs


In the sketch of the three Orders given in the Introduction it will
have been seen that the differences in their structure are so great
that it would have been hardly possible to have given a single blended
account of the whole Class But as all common Cirripedes are included
in the present Order here would have been the natural place for a
full description of their external and internal structure Having
however been necessarily yet perhaps unfortunately led to give in
my former volume a description of this kind of the Lepadid and as it
is necessary to give a similar account of the other great family of the
Order namely the Balanid I have found it more convenient to make
this latter account comparative and supplemental to the former one on
the Lepadid and so serve for the Order rather than attempt to give
a separate description in full of it For this latter plan would have
involved much useless repetition as on account of the many exceptions
and limitations necessary to almost every statement there is little
choice between a description of great length and a mere diagnostic
character of the Order such as I have given above

The Thoracica may be divided into three very natural Families of
nearly equal value firstly the Balanid or sessile Cirripedes
which may be subdivided into two subfamilies also very natural the
Balanin and Chthamalin secondly the Verrucid containing only
one genus and thirdly the Lepadid or pedunculated Cirripedes
These three families differ from each other besides in mere external
appearance almost exclusively in the relation of the different
portions of their external covering or carapace and of the muscles
moving such portions In the Balanid the four opercular valves
surrounding the orifice leading into the sack are capable of other
movements besides being opened and shut whereas all the other valves
are immoveably united together In the Lepadid the valves answering
to the opercular valves are furnished with a muscle only for shutting
them whereas the peduncle answering to the basis in the Balanid is
capable of various movements In the Verrucid the shell is singularly
asymmetrical only half of the operculum either the right or the left
side this varying even in the same species being moveable the other
half being immoveably united to the remaining valves and the whole
shell has only one muscle serving to shut the moveable half of the
operculum All the internal parts and organs are very similar in the
above three Families If however the internal structure of one of the
two subfamilies into which the Balanid may be divided namely of
the Balanin be compared with that of the Lepadid several important
differences may be detectedon the one hand in the Balanin the
presence of branchi the extremely complicated cementing apparatus
the difference in structure between the third and succeeding pairs of
cirri the large palpi the notched labrum and the laterally double
teeth of the mandiblesand on the other hand in the Lepadid the
presence of ovigerous frna caudal appendages bullate labrum and
often prominent olfactory orifices But if the Lepadid be compared in
these several respects with the other subfamily or Chthamalin which
cannot possibly be removed out of the family of Balanid many of these
differences break down and disappear in some or all of the species

The Lepadid include as has previously been noticed a much greater
range of difference than the Balanid and this is what might have
been expected for it is the most ancient family and extinction has
done its work separating genera which in accordance to analogy we
may suppose were once more nearly connected by intermediate forms The
Lepadid in one sense may be taken as the type of their order for
they have undergone less morphological differentiation that is they
differ the least from the last larval stage and seem to give the most
general idea of a Thoracic Cirripede On the other hand if we mean
as some authors do by the word type that form which in the group in
question has been most modified and illustrates every peculiarity of
its class in the strongest manner then we must look to the Balanin
and to its typical genus Balanus for the most Cirripedial form In
this genus the different portions of the carapace differ most and
subserve to a certain extent different ends and in minute structure
are most complicated here the cementing apparatus which offers the
main characteristic of the whole subclass is most complex here the
several pairs of cirri differ most from each other in structure and
action here the peculiar branchi organs apparently derived from the
modification of another organ itself confined to Cirripedes viz the
ovigerous frna are best developed here the nervous system is most
highly concentrated and lastly here we meet with the largest and
most massive species of the whole group




 Family BALANID or Sessile Cirripedes

Cirripedia without a peduncle scuta and terga furnished with
depressor muscles other valves united immoveably together

Almost every one who has walked over a rocky shore knows that a
barnacle or acornshell is an irregular cone formed generally of six
compartments with an orifice at the top closed by a neatlyfitted
moveable lid or operculum Within this shell the animals body is
lodged and through a slit in the lid it has the power of protruding
six pairs of articulated cirri or legs and of securing by their
means any prey brought by the waters within their reach The basis is
firmly cemented to the surface of attachment The whole shell basis
and operculum consists as we have already seen of the first three
segments of the head modified into a singularly constructed carapace
which encloses the mouth and rest of the body The anterior extremity
of the shell is situated in the centre of the basis where indeed
by due care the antenn of the pupa may be always detected and the
posterior extremity is directed vertically upwards

     The best published description of the structure of the
    shell of a sessile Cirripede is given by Dr Coldstream in the
    Encyclopdia of Anatomy and Physiology article Cirrhopoda


Structure of Shell

When the shell of a sessile Cirripede or barnacle for instance
of a Balanus is first examined the structure appears extremely
complicated but this can hardly be considered as really the case The
structure will I think be best understood by recalling to mind that
of Pollicipesthe oldest known genus from which in one sense all
ordinary Cirripedes both sessile and pedunculated seem to radiate
I must premise and the fact in itself deserves early notice that
the homologies of the several parts in the pedunculated and sessile
Cirripedes admits of no doubtthat is if amongst the pedunculated
the genus Pollicipes or certain species of Scalpellum be taken as a
standard of comparison The peduncle corresponds with the basis
as may be clearly seen if a Pollicipes with a short peduncle and a
Balanus with a deep cupformed or cylindrical basis be compared for
the contained parts are similar and both grow at their upper edges
upwards and outwards Secondly the valves round the lower part of
the capitulum of a Pollicipes though generally much more numerous
and forming more than one whorl or circle and not so closely packed
together answer to the compartments forming the shell of a sessile
Cirripede this is shown by their lateral and downward growth by their
upper ends generally projecting freely above the cavity in which the
animals body is lodged and in the case Pollicipes mitella by an
actual resemblance in outline some being triangular some broad at
the upper end and some subrhomboidal and lastly in the manner in
which they slightly overlap and indent each other moreover further
resemblances in the relative position and even in the size of the
several valves will hereafter be pointed out between certain sessile
genera amongst the Chthamalin and certain genera of the Lepadid
Thirdly the scuta and terga in Pollicipes so strikingly resemble
in manner of growth in position relatively to the animals bodyin
shapeand even in being articulated together the valves which form
the operculum or lid of sessile Cirripedes that their identity is at
once obvious

     Dr J E Gray long ago observed these homologies If Lepas be
    taken the comparison is not quite so simple owing to the growth
    of all the valves in that genus being upwards but in several
    species of Scalpellum we may see the intermediate steps between
    the normal downward growth of the valves in Pollicipes and the
    abnormal upward growth in Lepas

It may be well here further to premise that apparently none of the
sutures in the shells of Cirripedes correspond with the articulations
between the three archetype cephalic segments of which the whole shell
is formed or with the eight elemental pieces of which each separate
segment in the archetype crustacean is known to consist But as I
believe the several valves in the shell of a Cirripede are homologous
or at least analogous with the sclerodermic plates of which
the carapace of the Podophthalmia is formed with this difference
that in the latter they become after their first formation united
together into a single piece and are thus moulted as a whole whereas
in Cirripedes the valves or sclerodermic plates are not moulted but
continue to be added to throughout life

     Milne Edwards Annales des Sciences Naturelles tom xviii
     p 

In Pollicipes there is no difficulty in understanding the growth of
the lower valves of the capitulum especially if a species be taken
in which these valves stand a little way apart at each period of
growth they are added to at their basal edges and a little way up
both sides at the same time a new membrane connecting them together
is formed the old membrane disintegrating or being left hanging in
tatters to the last zone of growth Now if we look at the shell of
a sessile Cirripede there is no essential difference in the growth
of the compartments or valves all grow downwards and laterally but
they overlap each other much more laterally than in Pollicipes and
the connecting membrane is in most parts reduced to a mere film jammed
in between the valves but in the case of the opercular membrane it
still remains wide and is periodically moulted

In the annexed woodcut fig  of the rostrum of Balanus Hameri
the downward growth and the lateral growth on both sides is plain
The modified sides rr for convenience sake have been called the
radii they invariably overlap the adjoining compartments The middle
part p has been called the wall or parietal portion in the
specimen figured the walls and radii are distinctly separated but in
some cases especially amongst the Chthamalin the lines of growth are
absolutely continuous from one to the other In fig  of a Lateral
compartment of the same Balanus we have the same essential structure
but the left side a is more protuberant and is hollowed out in its
lower half it is also more distinctly separated from the parietal
portion this side has for convenience been called the ala it is
invariably overlapped by the adjoining compartment in some few cases
as in Pachylasma the ala is not hollowed out in its lower part and
from being added to in a straight line along its whole edge with the
lines of growth continuous with those on the wall it differs hardly at
all in appearance from a radius Lastly in fig  of the carina or
compartment facing the rostrum we have al aa on both sides these
being as in all cases overlapped by the adjoining compartments

Now the compartments in the shell of every sessile Cirripede are
without exception constructed on the above three simple patterns In
number they are   or  or all confluent together

Considering this simplicity in growth and form of the separated
compartments it seems at first surprising that the construction
and enlargement of the whole shell in Balanus should long have been
viewed as a difficulty But the radii from growing against rectangular
indentations or rather furrows in the opposed compartments come to
be set a little inwards and their external surfaces assume a very
different appearance from the wallportions of the compartments
which grow against the surface of attachment In different species
the summits of the radii and of the al grow either very much more
obliquely than in the species figured or more squarelythat is
they extend from tip to tip of the adjoining compartments parallel
to the basis In this latter case and when the surfaces of the radii
differ considerably in appearance from the walls as in Balanus
tintinnabulum Plate  I am not at all surprised that the radii
should have been described as separate elements and called are
interject or compartments of the second order for the shell of
this Balanus seems to be composed of six wedges with their points
upwards namely the parietal portions of the compartments and of
six other narrower wedges the radii with their points downwards
and the fact that these latter wedges consist simply of the sides
of the parietal portions modified by growing against the adjoining
compartments is completely masked I should add that sometimes the
radii are not developed which simply means that the overlapping
lateral edges of the compartments have not been added to during growth

The al are originally developed at the period of the metamorphosis
as slight lateral protuberances in the upper part of the compartments
from being overlapped and therefore not exposed to external
influences and from growing as in the case of the radii against
rectangular indentations or furrows in the adjoining compartments they
generally assume an extremely different appearance from the parietes
and might naturally be thought to have a very different nature But
the al in all cases as is obvious in Pachylasma are nothing but
the protuberant lateral edges of the compartments rendered thin and
modified during growth In order that the margins of the al should be
received in an indentation the upper internal surfaces of the walls
of the recipient compartments are thickened all round excepting where
they receive the al This thickened upper internal portion of the
walls or shell together with the al themselves form the part called
the sheath The sheath sometimes blends insensibly into the lower parts
of the compartments and then perhaps it would not be thought to be a
distinct element but often it is abruptly separated by an overhanging
edge see Pl  fig  b  b Pl  fig  b Pl  fig 
K from the lower part and then the sheath greatly complicates the
internal appearance but not the essential structure of the shell The
sheath acts beautifully like an internal hoop in strengthening the
shell round the orifice where it is naturally weaker than at the lower
or basal end where it adheres to the surface of attachment in the
upper part of the shell moreover the sutures between the compartments
do not go straight through but owing to the al projecting and being
overlapped are extremely oblique or the joints in the language of
carpenters may be said to be broken

There is one other point of structure in the shells of the Balanid
more especially of species like Balanus tintinnabulum which adds to
their apparent complexity namely that the rim or orifice of the shell
formed by the upper ends of the compartments projects considerably
above the opercular valves In a young Balanus immediately after the
metamorphosis the operculum is attached by the opercular membrane all
round to the summits of the compartments and there cannot be said to
be any orifice to the shell itself but only an orifice or slit between
the opercular valves but during growth as the compartments are added
to at their basal edges their upper ends are deserted and cease to
enclose the sack within which lies the animals body Hence the upper
ends come to project freely either quite separately as in some species
of Pollicipes where they cannot be said to form an orifice or more or
less united into a ring so as to form an orifice as in the different
species of Balanid It follows that to understand the real shape of
a Balanus or rather of the cavity enclosing the animals body all
that part of the shell which projects above the opercular membrane
may in imagination be removed as something extraneous like so many
spines not that I mean to say that these points of shell are dead on
the contrary they are often porose and penetrated by numerous threads
of corium This upper part of the shell thus produced so as to form
an orifice no doubt serves to protect the less strong and moveable
operculum

Horizontal sections through the Shells of the principal genera of
Balanid showing the arrangement of the Compartments Genera   and
 belong to the Chthamalin  and  to the Balanin

Number and Arrangement of the CompartmentsI have already stated
that the shell in every one of the Balanid consists of eight six
or four compartments or of all fused together into a single piece
and that the compartments themselves are all constructed on the three
simple patterns of which woodcuts figs    have been given
They are arranged in a certain definite order The type arrangement is
found amongst the Chthamalin as might have been expected inasmuch
as this subfamily is so closely related to the ancient genera
Pollicipes and Scalpellum whence all the Thoracic Cirripedia may be
said to radiate In Octomeris fig  the typearrangement of the
compartments eight in number is well shown the rostrum and carina
resemble each other and have al on both sides and therefore are
overlapped on both sides the rostrolateral compartments have radii
on both sides and therefore overlap the adjoining compartments on both
sides the lateral and carinolateral compartments have radii on their
carinal and al on their rostral sides and therefore overlap on one
side and are overlapped on the other side Now the shell of every
other sessile Cirripede differs I believe from that of Octomeris
only in the fusion together or abortion of some of the eight normal
compartments in one genus however Catophragmus outer whorls of
small compartments arranged like the lower valves in the capitulum
of Pollicipes are superadded The genus Chthamalus fig  differs
from Octomeris only in the carinolateral compartments being aborted
as will presently be discussed and hence has six compartments
Chamsipho fig  differs from Chthamalus only in the rostrolateral
and lateral compartments being fused together and hence has only four
compartments In Balanus fig  and the whole subfamily of the
Balanin the rostrum is compounded of the true rostrum as seen in the
type Octomeris and of the two rostrolateral compartments hence this
compounded rostrum has radii instead of al on both sides and there
are only six compartments Tetraclita fig  and Elminius differ
from Balanus only in having the carinolateral compartments absent and
probably aborted hence there are only four compartments Lastly in
Pyrgoma all the compartments are blended together into a single piece

In Pollicipes the old typeform of the whole order and in Scalpellum
we have four valves answering to the operculum surrounding the
aperture leading into the sack and the valves below are arranged in
successive whorls with a strong tendency to alternation For the
rostrum alternates with that is faces the interval between the two
scuta the carina alternates with the two terga and the upper lateral
valves alternate with the scutum and tergum on each side These four
valves namely the carina and rostrum which resemble each other
in structure and the pair of upper latera which are larger than
the other lateral valves together form the uppermost whorl or that
beneath the scuta and terga In the next whorl we have the rostro
and carinolateral valves alternating with those above them and
beneath them there are generally other valves which decrease in size
and display the same tendency to alternation The valves here just
specified namely the rostrum carina and three pairs of lateral
valves in the Lepadid are so much larger and are so much more
commonly present than the other valves of the capitulum that to
them alone I affixed special names Now if amongst sessile Cirripedes
we look to that genus viz Catophragmus which comes in its whole
structure the nearest to Pollicipes one of the Lepadid we find as
in fig  firstly a rostrum and carina resembling each other and
a pair of lateral compartments larger than the other lateral pairs
these four valves alternating with the opercular valves and secondly
we find but forming part of the same whorl a pair of rostrolateral
and a pair of carinolateral compartments which just as in
Pollicipes are larger than the exterior and lower valves These lower
little valves I may remark decrease in size in the successive whorls
and tend to alternate in position just as in Pollicipes Observing
these several striking points of correspondence in the valves and
indeed in the whole structure of Catophragmus and Pollicipes one
is strongly inclined to suspect that in Catophragmus and therefore
in Octomeris and other sessile Cirripedes although the rostro and
carinolateral compartments appear to lie in the same whorl with the
rostrum carina and large lateral compartments yet that they really
belong as in Pollicipes and Scalpellum to a lower whorl Now if a
very young shell of Balanus immediately after the metamorphosis be
examined the carinolateral compartments will be found not to have
been developed they first appear after two or three zones of growth
have been added to the other compartments bearing in mind that in
Pollicipes and in Catophragmus the lower whorls are added successively
during growth we find in this fact strong confirmation of the view
that the carinolateral compartments normally belong to a whorl beneath
that including the rostrum carina and lateral compartments Whether
the rostrolateral like the carinolateral compartments are developed
subsequently to the others I have had no opportunity of ascertaining
and therefore cannot confirm the above analogical conclusion namely
that they also belong to a lower whorl

In the subfamily Balanin which includes Balanus woodcut  and
Tetraclita woodcut  the shell is characterised by not having
rostrolateral compartments and by the rostrum having radii now in
Pachylasma giganteum which undoubtedly belongs to the subfamily
Chthamalin at a very early age the rostrolateral compartments become
blended with the true rostrum making a compound rostrum exactly like
the rostrum in the Balanin distinct evidence of a similar fusion
is retained throughout life Pl  fig  in all three species of
Chelonobia which is undoubtedly a member of the Balanin Hence I
think we may conclude that in all the genera of the Balanin the
rostrolateral compartments are probably not aborted but are blended
with a normal rostrum resembling that in woodcuts    making
together a compound rostrum furnished with radii it must however be
observed that I could not detect any actual evidence of this fusion
in Balanus even immediately after the metamorphosis In Chamsipho
woodcut  either the rostrolateral compartments attain a most
unusual breadth or as is more probable they have become confluent
with the lateral compartments which in the Lepadid seem to be the
most persistent of all the lateral valves In such genera as Tetraclita
and Chthamalus in which the carinolateral compartments are absent
they may be fused with the lateral compartments or with the carina but
seeing that they are normally developed later than the other valves
it appears to be the simplest theory to assume until the contrary
be proved that they are aborted Finally the somewhat unexpected
conclusion that the shell not including the operculum of sessile
Cirripedes normally consists of eight valves four belonging to an
upper whorl and four to a lower whorl all forced into a single ring
and often more or less fused together though not strictly proved
is rendered highly probable I will only further add that the Basis
perhaps represents several whorls of the small valves or scales on the
peduncle of Pollicipes fused together the comparison of the basis
with the calcareous cup forming the lowest portion of the peduncle in
Lithotrya which has been made by some authors I do not think is very
accurate as the cup in Lithotrya seems to have a special relation to
the boring habits of that genus

Structure of the Individual Compartments

If the basal margin of a compartment for instance of Balanus
tintinnabulum be examined it appears sufficiently complicated
being composed of an outer and inner lamina separated by longitudinal
septa which are denticulated at their bases and the tubes formed
by these longitudinal septa are crossed by transverse septa On the
other hand in some cases as in the genera Chthamalus and Elminius
each compartment consists of a simple shelly layer These two extreme
states graduate into each other we have firstly on the internal
surface quite irregular points and ridges these become regular
causing the internal surface to be longitudinally ribbed then these
ribs themselves become finely furrowed on their sides and at their
lower ends producing sharp minute ridges the ends of which I have
called the denticuli and lastly some of the denticuli on the
adjoining longitudinal septa become united into a solid layer forming
the internal lamina of the wall These denticuli do not generally
cover the whole surface of the longitudinal ribs but leave a portion
near the outer lamina of the compartment smooth The denticulated ends
of the longitudinal septa project beyond the basal edge of both the
outer and inner lamin and enter the mouths of the tubes where such
occur in the basis and thus strengthen the shell The whole of the
internal lamina generally is more or less striated longitudinally
thus displaying its origin from the union of the inner edges of the
longitudinal septa I need only further remark that on the internal
surface of the outer lamina between the main longitudinal septa there
are generally as in the woodcut smaller longitudinal ridges which do
not reach the inner lamina and on this account alone are not called
septa

Tubes are formed by the longitudinal septa between the outer and
inner lamin These tubes are almost square and are occupied by
threads of corium which enter at pores left open between the edge of
the compartment and that of the basis on which it rests The tubes
extend high up the compartments but in the uppermost part they are
generally cut off by thin transverse calcareous septa deposited by
the ends of the threads of corium a cancellated structure being thus
produced Or the uppermost part of each tube becomes filled up solidly
with compact shelly layers which are always first thrown down on the
side of the tube facing the outside and thus greatly strengthen the
shell in several instances as in Balanus perforatus and Tetraclita
porosa in which the disintegration of the upper part of the shell is
a necessary element in its growth for the enlargement of the orifice
these filled up tubes become exposed In Coronula and Tubicinella the
tubes in their upper parts are I believe crossed only by transverse
membranous septa

Anomalies and exceptionsIn Tetraclita Pl  fig  g  h
from the branching of the longitudinal septa several irregular rows
of tubes are formed In certain varieties of Balanus balanoides
Pl  fig  b and in B cariosus Pl  fig  b slight
branching ridges on the internal surface of the walls seem to
answer to the longitudinal septa and produce during the downward
growth of the shell extremely irregular cells and short tubes In
Balanus vinaceus Pl  fig  d the internal lamina instead
of being solid as in every other species is left cancellated and
thus betrays much more plainly than usual its origin in the united
denticuli of the adjoining longitudinal septa In Balanus porcatus
between the main longitudinal septa there are Pl  fig  e
what may be called rudimentary and disconnected longitudinal septa In
Coronula and its allies Pl  fig  and Pl  fig  c it
is the outer lamina of the compartment which is anomalous for in the
two or three lower zones of growth it forms only a ledge on each side
of the longitudinal septa which ledges higher up become confluent
and so form an ordinary outer lamina In Coronula also the wall of
each compartment see transverse section Pl  figs   is very
remarkable from being deeply folded the folds being on their internal
faces firmly calcified together and on their external faces closely
pressed together often with a neatly serrated suture so that the
whole nature of the shell might be as has happened easily quite
misunderstood and the walls be considered as very thick instead of
being as is really the case very thin In Chelonobia Pl  fig
 however the walls are truly of such great thickness that the
nature of the relative parts might likewise be misunderstood in this
genus the ovarian tubes enter the walls extending up between the
longitudinal septa or as they may here be more naturally called
the radiating septa I will specify a few more peculiarities worthy
of remarkin some species of the subgenus Acasta clefts are left
covered only by membrane on the lines of suture Pl  figs  a
 a between the compartments just above the basis and in other
species the basis is perforated by numerous membranecovered minute
orifices In Platylepas each compartment has one deep inward fold Pl
 fig  somewhat analogous to the three folds in Coronula this
fold is produced into an internal midrib supporting and rendering
convex the membranous basis in this genus also the rostrum owing
to its midrib is generally thrust a little on one side and the shell
thus rendered asymmetrical In Chamsipho scutelliformis the shell
is symmetrically perforated Pl  fig  a by four apertures
Lastly in Chthamalus Hembeli and intertextus after a certain age
the basal edges of the walls become inflected and continue to grow
inwards till they entirely take the place of the true membranous basis


Structure of the Radii

RadiusThis term as we have seen is applied to that side of the
compartment the growth of which is modified by abutting against and
overlapping the adjoining compartment Hence the structure of the
radius is essentially the same with that of the parietal portion of the
compartment When best developed as in Balanus tintinnabulum the
radius consists of an outer and inner lamina separated by denticulated
septa extending in horizontal lines parallel to the basis and is
consequently perforated by minute tubes or pores The tubes become
filled up solidly much more commonly than do the parietal tubes and
the inner lamina in such cases is hardly distinct from the outer
lamina The denticuli often fail or are present only on the lower
sides of the septa and very frequently the edge of the radius can only
be said to be crenated Notwithstanding these frequent anomalies if a
series of species and genera be taken it is certain that there is as
might have been expected a close relationship in internal structure
between the radii and the parietes The edge of the radius is received
in a slight furrow generally marked like a seal with the impression
of the denticulated septa in the opposed compartment sometimes the
outer edge or lid of the recipient furrow is so broad as to give the
false appearance of a radius having been developed at least in the
lower part of the shell on both sides of the suture A crest of corium
runs into each suture between the edge of the radius and the furrow in
the opposed compartment and when the radius is permeated by pores as
in woodcut  threads of corium branch off this crest and enter the
pores In the lower part of the shell these crests of corium project
from the corium forming and surrounding the sack but in the upper
part of the shell above the opercular membrane and therefore above
the sack the corium is produced up each line of suture as a separate
ribbon In proportion as these ribbons extend more or less near to the
summit of the shell so do the edges of the radii continue to be added
to to a greater or less height from the basis and consequently their
summits become less or more oblique

Peculiarities in the Structure of the RadiiIn some of the species
of Tetraclita in which genus the walls consist of several rows of
tubes the radii are likewise perforated by several rows and in some
of the other species Pl  fig  h the edge or disarticulated
surface of the radius is marked by irregularly branching ridges and
these evidently correspond with the branching septa or ridges of the
wall In Chelonobia the outer lamina of the radius as well as of
its recipient furrow is of extraordinary thickness and this lamina
in C testudinaria Pl  fig  a  b and Pl  fig
 f is modelled into sharp transverse ridges and valleys In
the Chthamalin the radii like the parietes are simply solid and
apparently in consequence for the sake of strengthening the sutures
the edges of the radii and of the recipient furrow in Octomeris
Pl  fig  a and in Chthamalus dentatus and Hembeli Pl
 fig  b  a are neatly dentated In some other species
of Chthamalus Pl  fig  a the radii present a slight
modification of this structure the sutures being formed by oblique
interfolding lamin In the radii of Coronula and Tubicinella there
is a peculiarity in apparent connection with the fact that in these
genera the parietal tubes are not crossed by transverse calcareous
septa namely that the pores by which the radii are permeated keep
unclosed throughout their length and open into a special longitudinal
tube Pl  fig  d which runs along that margin of the wall
whence the radius arises In Coronula the wall is of extreme thinness
and in conformity so is the true radius but that the shell might not
thus be rendered very weak complementary or pseudoradii are developed
on their inner sides Pl  fig  adjoining the true radii A d
C d and shaded by distant convex lines Even in the allied genus
Xenobalanus in which the whole shell tends to become rudimentary
traces of these pseudoradii Pl  fig  b d can be detected
In Coronula though the radii Pl  fig  A d C d are by
the above special means rendered thick and though the al also are
thick C a D a yet together they do not equal in thickness the
folded walls and consequently there is left between the radii and al
square chambers v occupied by the branching ovarian tubes


Structure of the Al

These project generally abruptly from the sides of the upper part of
the compartments they appear from the first growth of the shell they
are overlapped by the radius and by part of the wall of the adjoining
compartment they are thinner and have owing apparently to being
overlapped a very different aspect from the parietal portion but
they do not differ from it in essential nature They are solid that
is they are never permeated by pores but their edges are generally
crenated and there is in some cases as in Chelonobia sufficient
evidence that these crenations answer to the horizontal septa on
the edges of the radii also often reduced to mere crenations and
consequently likewise to the longitudinal septa of the parietes
In Coronula the edge of each ala consists of a medial ridge sending
off denticulated septa on both sides and is therefore anomalous as
compared with the al in other genera but corresponds in structure
with the similarly anomalous radius of Coronula In order to allow of
the growth of the edge of the ala a fine thread of corium runs up the
narrow furrow in which the edge is lodged proceeding from the corium
of the sack In proportion as this thread runs up higher or lower
so are the summits of the al rendered during growth less or more
oblique


Structure of the Sheath

As the compartments overlap each other the edges of the al would have
projected and the inner surface of the orifice of the shell would not
have been smooth and rounded had not that part of each wall which
does not overlie an ala been thickened so as to allow of the formation
of a shoulder or indentation against which the edge of the ala fits
and abuts The thickened portions and the al themselves together
form the sheath of which the use seems to be to strengthen like a
broad internal hoop the upper part of the shell round the orifice
where naturally it is weak The sheath is composed of successive fine
shelly layers which extend as the shell is added to at the basal
margin lower and lower down on the inner surface of the walls The
lower edge of the sheath either simply projects a little inwards or
more commonly is formed into a sharp depending ridge as represented
in fig  K Pl  In some species of Pyrgoma Pl  fig 
b the sheath reaches nearly to the bases of the compartments
and in Chelonobia Pl  fig  e c e the inner layer of
shell surrounding the sack which seems to correspond more nearly
to the sheath than to the inner lamina of the walls actually rests
on the basal membrane The opercular membrane is generally but not
invariably attached only a little way above the lower edge of the
sheath at each exuviation a new opercular membrane is formed and is
attached to the next lower zone of the sheath the old membrane being
cast off but a circular slip of it is left investing the last zone
Hence the whole upper part of the sheath above the opercular membrane
comes to be thus invested and is marked by circular lines one above
the other caused by the successive exuviations This investing
membrane often supports rows of minute bristles directed upwards
Generally a film of shell is deposited at the period of the formation
of each new opercular membrane on that part of the sheath which lies
immediately beneath This innermost film or thin layer of shell on
the lines of suture between the compartments breaks joint at least
in some cases with the underlying shelly layersthat is the suture
in this lastformed film does not lie exactly over the suture in the
subjacent layers of the sheath In Tubicinella the sheath extends down
close to the basis and what is unique in this one genus the opercular
membrane gradually thinning out downwards closely adheres to the
whole inner surface of the shell In Tubicinella and in Xenobalanus
Pl  fig  b the sheath separates easily into separate
successive rims of shell and this structure evidently is for the sake
of facilitating the breakage of the upper end of the shell which as
we shall presently see is necessary to allow of the increase in size
of its orifice


Structure of the Basis

This in several genera and species is composed of simple membrane
and consists of successive concentric circular slips added round the
outside at each period of growth In some species of Tetraclita and
Balanus the basis is calcareous but diaphanous very thin smooth or
somewhat granulated In other cases it consists of a single calcareous
lamina either smooth or with ridges radiating from its centre it
is formed of two lamin as is most usual in Balanus separated by
radiating septa These septa as well as the radiating ridges in the
case of the single lamina are homologous with the longitudinal septa
of the parietes The denticulated ends of the latter enter the mouths
of the tubes formed by the radiating septa of the basis threads of
corium pass between the denticuli of the parietal septa and thus
enter the basal tubes The ends of these threads of corium generally
deposit transverse calcareous septa exactly as within the parietal
tubes When the basis is thick the septa themselves ccc between
the proper basal tubes become porose or rather cancellated and
they sometimes expand into a very thick cancellated layer separating
the outer lamina a of the basis from the proper basal tubes which
always lie close under the inner lamina b This structure differs
only slightly from that seen in the parietes of Tetraclita in which
the branching of the longitudinal parietal septa produces thick walls
formed of several rows of tubes or pores With respect to peculiarities
in structure of the basis Balanus lvis offers the most remarkable
case for here in specimens which have grown crowded together the
whole interior appears sometimes to have become too much elongated or
too deep for the animals body and consequently the lower part of
the deeplyconcave basis has been filled up Pl  fig  a by
thin irregular calcareous diaphragms In elongated specimens also
of Balanus balanoides the shell sometimes appears to have grown
too long for the animals body but in this case the membranous basis
becomes extremely convex inwards it still reaches the basal edges of
the parietes all round but in the middle it is raised high above the
surface of attachment yet sometimes threads of the cementing tissue
depend from the middle part to the surface of attachment In Balanus
terebratus Pl  fig  a  b and in some species of Acasta
the basis is riddled as previously stated by numerous minute
membranecovered orifices In B declivis the membranous basis is
always extremely oblique owing to the rostral end of the shell being
twice as high as the carinal and opposite end

Regarding the very remarkable means by which the basis of sessile
Cirripedes is cemented to the surface of attachment it will be
convenient to defer for a little the description on account of its
necessary length


Structure of the Opercular Valves Scuta and Terga

These are situated on each side of the slit or orifice leading into the
sack from their shape their powers of movement their separation by
flexible membrane from the shell to which they serve as a lid they
appear at first as if they constituted an element very distinct from
the shell itself but this is not the case They are together with the
opercular membrane as essentially as the whole of what is externally
visible a part of the modified carapace of which they occupy the
upper or posterior extremity from tracing the metamorphoses or
even by comparison of a Balanus with Pollicipes there can be no
doubt of the truth of this conclusion The opercular valves are four
in numbera pair of scuta and a pair of terga but the latter in
Coronula diadema and regin are either aborted or represented by
a mere rudiment and in Xenobalanus both scuta and terga are quite
absent In several cases more especially in the genus Pyrgoma Pl
 fig  b the scutum and tergum on each side are calcified
together so that sometimes not even a trace of the line of junction
can be discovered In most cases the scutum is firmly united being
articulated in a manner presently to be described to the tergum but
in Coronula Tubicinella Pl  fig  c and Platylepas the ends
of these valves are simply approximated

ScutaThese valves are important inasmuch as the animals body
is attached to them in Pl  fig  the broken line surrounding
a b shows where the body has been cut in removing the scutum
on the near side the other scutum S being left articulated to the
tergum T In shape the scuta are generally subtriangular but in some
species of Pyrgoma and in Chelonobia c they are much elongated The
lines of growth are usually prominent and along the occludent margins
the alternate or sometimes every third or fourth line is developed
into a knob which produces a serrated edge serving to lock the two
opposed valves together there is however no trace of this structure
in Coronula and Tubicinella In some species of Pyrgoma a ledge of
considerable breadth Pl  fig  e c is developed along
the occludent margins of the two scuta as well as of the two terga
giving them an anomalous structure The Terga differ considerably
in outline in the different genera and species their shape approaches
more nearly to a triangle than to any other regular form but there is
generally a projection or spur on the basal margin on the side towards
the scutum In some species of Pyrgoma the tergum is of so irregular a
shape as to defy description In most cases a longitudinal depression
or furrow runs down the valve from the apex to the extremity of the
spur and it not rarely happens that the sides of this furrow become
folded inwards and almost closed The spur probably answers to the
basal point of the usually subrhomboidal tergum in Pollicipes and
Scalpellum The tips of the terga in some species of Balanus c
are specially modified into sharp points or beaks Pl  fig  b
 d bowed a little inwards and projecting considerably above the
tips of the scuta this is effected by the medial uppermost part
of the valve being internally thickened and hardened and then by
the disintegration of the two margins and the external surface the
internal modified portion becomes exposed The whole valve also at
least in such cases as in Balanus psittacus appears to be forced
slowly upwards in the articular furrow of the scutum I am assured by
a competent observer that the beaks of the terga in B porcatus can
give an object placed within the orifice of the shell a sharp tap

     In comparing the Tergum of one of the Balanid with that
    of a typical member of the Lepadid for instance that of
    Balanus with that of Pollicipes apex corresponds with apex
    the extremity of the spur in Balanus corresponds with the basal
    point of the whole valve in Pollicipes the scutal margin which
    in Balanus homologically extends down to the extremity of the
    spur corresponds with the scutal margin of Pollicipes the
    carinal margin in Balanus corresponds with the upper carinal
    margin in Pollicipes the basal margin of Balanus on the carinal
    side of the spur corresponds with the lower carinal margin in
    Pollicipes lastly and this is the chief difference in Balanus
    there is no appreciable occludent margin the apex of the valve
    being brought close to the upper angle of the scutal margin in
    Chthamalus however there is yet left some remnant of an occludent
    marginwhich margin in Pollicipes is conspicuous

The scutum and tergum with the few exceptions above stated are
articulated together at a large or open angle The articulation see
Pl  fig  b c d and fig  b c is effected by the
margin of the tergum being a little inflected and lodged in a furrow
in the margin of the scutum This furrow in the scutum has its further
border generally prominent and often reflexed or curved over I have
called it the articular ridge it also is lodged in a furrow in the
upper part of the tergum which again is bordered by a ridge viz the
articular tergal ridge So that in both scutum and tergum there is an
articular furrow bordered in each case on one side by the margin of
the valve and on the other side by the socalled articular ridge In
Chelonobia Pl  fig  b the articular ridge of the scutum is
horny When as often happens the scuta and terga have been much worn
the manner of their articulation Pl  fig  a is pretty well
shown even from the outside in this case their external appearance
is very different from what it is in those individuals fig  c
of the same species which have not suffered disintegration This
articulation of the scuta and terga is prefigured amongst the Lepadid
in Pollicipes mitella and in Lithotrya

The scuta are brought together by a short strong straight adductor
muscle Pl  fig  a its attachment leaves with very few
exceptions as in Tubicinella a rounded impression or even pit on
the under side of the valve in its upper part This pit is frequently
bounded on its lower side by a sharp ridge which though not in
actual connexion with the adductor muscle I have for convenience
sake called the adductor ridge it serves apparently to give support
to the animals body in some few cases as in B psittacus Pl 
fig  c it is confluent at its upper end with the articular ridge
and converts the whole basitergal corner of the valve into a deep
cavity In some of the species of Pyrgoma Pl  fig  c  b
and in some varieties of Creusia this adductor ridge is enormously
developed so as to depend far beneath the true basal margin or
that to which the opercular membrane is attached At the basitergal
corner of the valve there is generally a small pit or impression and
sometimes distinct crests for the attachment of the lateral depressor
muscle At the rostral end there is also a small cavity formed by the
overfolding of the occludent margin rarely furnished with crests for
the attachment of the rostral depressor muscle In the Terga at the
basicarinal corner there are usually crests though sometimes feebly
developed for the attachment of the tergal depressor muscle But in
Chelonobia Coronula Tubicinella Platylepas and in some other cases
there are no crests The crests when well developed are furnished
with rectangular subcrests or denticuli on both sides in fact they
resemble and are probably homologous with the denticulated ribs or
septa in the parietes radii and basis Altogether the scuta and terga
are attached as far as muscles are concerned to the shell and sack
by three longitudinal pairs


Growth of the Whole Shell and Its Microscopical Structure

The opercular valves are added to along their basal margins alone
the animals body together with the several muscles becoming attached
at each period of growth lower and lower down to the valves this
no doubt is effected by the absorption of the upper surfaces of the
muscles and the formation of new fasci on their lower surfaces The
opercular membrane which though thin and flexible forms part of
the general outer surface of the animal as much as does any portion
of the rigid shell with which indeed it is strictly homologous is
periodically moulted together with the integuments of the whole
included animal The new opercular membrane is of course each time
formed a little larger than the old one In Coronula and Tubicinella
however several successive opercular membranes are preserved one
over the other and the outside membrane gradually disintegrates in
these cases the undermost opercular membrane is formed wrinkled and
considerably too large so as to allow of being stretched before it
is finally cast off In Tubicinella the opercular membrane runs down
adhering to the inner surface of the shell to nearly the basis and
hence during the diametric growth of the shell it is longitudinally
split and is repaired by slips of new membrane which resemble the
radii in form and in direction of the lines of growth

     In some species of Pyrgoma the ledge limbus occludens
    which is added along the occludent margin of both scuta and terga
    and in some species of Balanus a narrow rim or slight protuberance
    which is added along the carinal margin of the terga offer
    unimportant exceptions to the rule that the opercular valves grow
    only at their basal margins

The basis is added to only round the circumference and hence
increases in diameter and when concave in depth The compartments
grow at their basal margins where they are in contact with the basis
hence the shell is added to in height and owing to the outward
inclination of the compartments also in basal diameter but the
compartments likewise in most cases grow along both lateral margins
that is on the edges of the radii and al and hence the upper part
of the shell also increases in diameter The orifice of the shell
moreover thus becomes enlarged In some cases the shell is destitute
of radii only sutures being present that is the compartments do not
grow laterally and sometimes as in the whole genus Pyrgoma there
are not even sutures the compartments having been fused together
in both these cases the shell can increase in diameter only at the
base and the orifice it might have been thought would necessarily
have remained to the destruction of the animal of the same minute
size as when first formed after the metamorphosis this certainly
would have been the case had not the upper ends of the compartments
surrounding and forming the orifice been nicely adapted always to
yield in a certain limited degree to the disintegrating influences
to which every shell is exposed but which most Cirripedes can resist
and the disintegration of the narrow end of a conical tube of course
increases the diameter of its orifice In Tubicinella in which the
shell is furnished with narrow radii and does increase in diameter
from top to bottom the increase is not sufficient in proportion to
the continued elongation of the shell to compensate for this the
orifice is enlarged at short intervals by the breakage of the upper
end of the shell for which purpose as explained under the genus it
is evidently constructed Hence we see that in certain Cirripedes
decay or disintegration and breakage are necessary elements in their
growth It is a remarkable fact which I cannot explain that in
some species in which the orifice of the shell is usually increased
by disintegration if individuals are so situated that they are not
exposed to sufficiently energetic disintegrating influences as may be
inferred from the wellpreserved condition of the whole surface of the
shell then the radii become developed and the orifice is increased in
size by the diametric growth of the upper part of the shell I have
seen instances of this in Tetraclita porosa and purpurascens and
in Balanus perforatus it appeared but of course erroneously as if
the lateral growth of the compartments had been subjected to the will
of the animal

Considering the strength of the shell of sessile Cirripedes the
separation of their compartments one from another and from the basis
during growth has justly been thought a surprising circumstance In
most Chthamalin and in some species of Balanus however if the shell
be boiled in caustic potash the compartments fall apart with a touch
this shows that their union is due to animal and probably to organised
matter and the growth of such matter between the opposed edges of
the compartments and their consequent gradual separation offers
no particular difficulty But in many Balani boiling in potash for
hours does not seem even to weaken in the least degree the sutures
which are wonderfully strongthe shell often breaking rather than
yield on these lines if however the shell be dissolved in acid
the animalised tissue which is left easily separates on the lines of
suture and if this tissue be boiled in potash the remnants of the
compartments fall quite separate These facts seem to me to show that
the compartments in such cases are joined along the lines of suture by
tissue which must be in a calcified state but which nevertheless
continues to grow by intersusception in other words I believe that
the tips of the complicated ridges and points interlocking on the lines
of suture are not separated from each other by films of corium or
simple animal matter but are actually united by corium in a calcified
yet still growing condition

In ordinary Crustaceans the growth is periodical and sudden a new
and larger carapace for instance is formed under the old one and
after the exuviation of the latter the new one soon hardens and does
not subsequently increase in size so it is in the case of Cirripedes
with the membranes of the body and even with certain parts as
the opercular membrane of the external covering But a Cirripede
cannot like a crab crawl into some crevice and remain protected
till its shell becomes hardened hence probably it is that the
shell is never wholly moulted Even if the margins of the opposed
compartments and of the basis were to grow rapidly the shell would
necessarily be much weakened on the lines of suture and unable to
withstand the heavy breakers to which so many species of sessile
Cirripedes are exposed On the other hand although the margins are
thus compelled to grow slowly they do not grow continuously as may
be seen in the zones of increment on all the valves corresponding I
believe with the periods of exuviation of the membranes of the body A
layer of shell often very thin seems to be generally deposited over
the whole internal surface of the several valves at the same time that
the marginal zones are added so that the only essential difference
in the growth of the external covering in Cirripedes as compared
with ordinary Crustaceans is that the old shell is not cast off but
adheres to the outside of the new shell and that the margins are
added to in certain definite directions slowly yet not continuously
instead of the whole being formed at a single period

     In the genus Alcippe and in Cryptophialus the whole of
    the external membranes are moulted excepting the surface of
    attachment but then these Cirripedes live in cavities which
    they form for themselves and are thus protected In Lithotrya
    the membrane of the peduncle with its little valves or scales
    is moulted but here again this very part is protected by the
    tubular cavity which the animal forms and inhabits Neither of
    these three genera belong to the Balanid or sessile Cirripedes
    which we are now more especially describing

If now a section of one of the shelly zones of growth be carefully
examined it can in some cases be distinctly seen to be formed of
successive excessively fine lamin but the animalised tissue which
differs much in amount in different Cirripedes left after the shell
has been dissolved in acid exhibits in most cases neither lamin nor
any other structure whatever The shell seems to be the actual pulpy
corium or true skin in a calcified condition but generally with its
cellular structure modified and much reduced I have taken a bit of
recentlyformed shell of Tetraclita and of Coronula with the corium
still adherent to its under surface and after dissolution in acid I
could not distinguish the part which had just before existed as shell
from the corium itself In the case of Coronula immediately prior
to the period of moulting and growth I found the unaltered corium so
charged as to effervesce with carbonate of lime either in a state of
dissolution or in granules too minute to be visible under the highest
powers

The sutures between the several compartments and the basis are covered
by thin membrane which is continually splitting during the growth
of the opposed edges of the underlying shell but previously to each
splitting a new slip of membrane is I believe already formed under
the old one so that the corium is not even momentarily exposed Owing
to this manner of growth the slips of membrane consist of successive
rims united together in most cases these soon become abraded from the
older parts of the shell but are sometimes preserved The lastformed
slip of membrane over a suture is homologous with the opercular
membrane and both are strictly analogous with the ring of flexible
membrane forming the joint of the leg of a crab In the latter case
the flexible membrane and hardened crust are both moulted together
in the opercular membrane there is a double line of splitting one
close round the opercular valves and the other at the basal edge of
the sheath and the intermediate portion is moulted but with a zone of
membrane left adherent to the nonmoulted valves and sheath lastly
in the slips of membrane covering the sutures there is only a single
line of splitting and no portion I believe is moulted the rims of
membrane on each side remaining adherent on the compartments and basis
until worn away

The opercular membrane when closely examined exhibits no structure
except that it can sometimes be plainly seen to be composed of
successive numerous excessively thin lamin Occasionally however
it presents the false appearance of being permeated by parallel and
anastomosing vessels this appearance is clue to one or more of the
component lamin having been wrinkled before a succeeding lamina was
thrown down and attached to its under side If a small piece of an
opercular valve of Tubicinella with the opercular membrane adhering
to it and with the corium under both be dissolved in acid it may
be clearly made out that the corium under the valve has gone on
being converted into shell whereas under the opercular membrane it
has been converted and condensed into fine constituent lamin of
chitine Inasmuch as the successive layers of shell during each period
of growth go on encroaching on those of the membrane the line of
junction between the shell and chitine becomes oblique or bevelled The
membrane on this bevelled line of junction assumes a slightly different
aspect to what it has elsewhere it becomes yellowish or brown thicker
and very much tougher In many genera it is also furnished with a row
of small bristles At the period of exuviation the opercular membrane
separates just outside this modified portion leaving the latter
adherent as a rim or slip on the valves If however the opercular
membrane be rudely torn off before its proper period of exuviation
it carries with it the as yet continuous but already modified slip
A slightly indented line may sometimes be traced before the period of
exuviation showing where the separation will take place what produces
this line I know not The coloured thickened and modified slips of
opercular membrane which are thus retained adhering to the valves
and which together form an investing membrane have been considered
by most authors as the epidermis but they have no more right to be
thus called than has any other part of the opercular membrane Exactly
similar slips of membrane are left investing the sheath So again the
membrane which when well preserved invests the walls of the shell
is made up as already stated of successively adherent slips which
originally covered the lines of suture

     In the case of Coronula there is a peculiarity described in
    the last section of this Introduction under the head of Cementing
    Apparatus namely that the two or three lastformed exterior
    zones of the Basal membrane continue for a period to increase in
    width being as I believe dragged one from over the other with
    fresh lamin of membrane continually thrown down In this same
    genus and in Tubicinella the walls of the shell are invested
    by membrane which is doubled inwards under their basal edges
    and as the latter grow the investing parietal membrane splits
    and separates from the basal membrane and is pulled outwards and
    downwards This inflected often broad border of membrane seems to
    me more strictly comparable with the opercular membrane than with
    those narrow thickened rims of yellowish membrane which in other
    Cirripedes cover the suture between the basal edges of the walls
    and the basis

The little bristles above alluded to which arise from the slips of
membrane left adherent on the opercular valves sheath and walls
stand in rows a row corresponding to each period of exuviation of
the opercular membrane The bristles are generally largest on the
opercular valves and sheath in Balanus tintinnabulum they are
from  to ths of an inch in length but they are longer in some
other species I may here mention as showing the connexion of these
bristles with the opercular membrane that similar bristles occur in
B perforatus scattered over the surface of that membrane and
are necessarily moulted with it In the imbedded genera Coronula and
Tubicinella none of these bristles exist When a portion of valve or
shell furnished with bristles is dissolved in acid tough sinuous
and apparently hollow threads are seen to run from their bulblike
bases into and up the corresponding layer which before dissolution
existed as shell and they terminate internally in very fine points
which I believe are united to the underlying corium These threads or
tubuli as I have called them in my volume on the Lepadid are
in Tetraclita porosa about ths of an inch in diameter but
only half that size in B tintinnabulum On parts of the shell where
there are no bristles similar tubuli penetrate the shelly layers and
come to the surface The tubuli running to the lowest and lastformed
row of bristles just after a period of exuviation are so delicate as
hardly or not at all to be distinguished in the row above they are
plain and longer and for the next two or three upper rows they are in
some cases as in Tetraclita porosa longer and longer having been
added to during each successive thickening of the valve These tubuli
consist of chitine and no doubt first existed as threads of corium
they are so tough that they must serve to strengthen the successive
layers of shell but I imagine their chief function is to keep up the
vitality of the newlyformed layers of shell May we not also venture
to suppose that by their means some degree of sensibility is given
to the bristles I need only further remark that in some species of
Balanus and of Chthamalus the under side of the shell is penetrated
by irregular pores large enough to be visible to the naked eye into
which threads of corium penetrate but these can hardly be said to
appertain to the microscopical structure and are more nearly related
to those pores and furrows formed by the greater or less development
of the longitudinal septa and in which the threads of corium deposit
or rather become changed into transverse septa or solid shelly
matter as previously described

     I regret that I have used this term tubuli for the threads
    thus designated I believe are not the same with the tubuli of
    Dr Carpenter which are not left after dissolution in acid I have
    seen tubuli as called by me in the shell from the leg of a crab
    after having been placed in acid


Muscles of Sack

In the pupa the thorax as we shall hereafter more fully see is
continuous with and opens into the large anterior end or front part of
the head but during the metamorphosis Pl  fig  the thorax of
the Cirripede becomes owing to the almost transverse position occupied
by the young animal within the pupa to a great extent internally
separated from the anterior endwhich anterior end forms as we know
either the peduncle or the basis Hence it comes to pass that the
body or Thorax Pl  fig  is lodged within a sack f within
the shell The chitine membrane lining this sack is excessively thin
and transparent but less so in Xenobalanus and Tubicinella it is
obviously continuous with that investing the body of the animal it is
also essentially continuous with the opercular valves and membrane
and consequently with the whole shell It is periodically moulted It
is lined by corium as is likewise the surrounding shell hence the
corium is double round the sack as indeed might have been expected
from the shell and opercular valves at least their upper parts being
formed by the prolongation as is obvious in the pupa of the posterior
edges of the carapace Between the two folds of corium which are
united together by transverse ligamentous fibres branching out at
both extremities like the roots and branches of a tree we have the
longitudinal muscles which go to the opercular valves and likewise a
layerlike mass of branching ovarian tubes Pl  fig  g the
ovarian tubes however are often confined to the base of the sack
In Xenobalanus the two folds of corium are united by longitudinal
membranous septa making a series of quite peculiar square tubes

The abovementioned muscles are attached at their upper ends to the
opercular valves and at their lower ends to the basis There are in
fact three pairs but the pair attached to the basicarinal angles of
the two terga Pl  fig  i are almost invariably confluent
forming one great bundle the second pair is attached to the lateral
or basitergal corners of the two scuta and are hidden in the figure
the third pair h is attached also to the scuta to their rostral
angles These muscles can only act as depressores they are often
extremely powerful they belong to the voluntary class for they
are transversely striped By their action the opercular valves are
capable of varied slight movements within the limit allowed by the
width of the flexible opercular membrane By the action of the lateral
scutal depressores the orifice leading into the sack is opened the
movement being generally aided by the protrusion of the cirri By the
sudden contraction of the rostral scutal depressores the blows which
are sometimes given by the beaked terga at the opposite end of the
operculum are probably effected By the contraction of all three pairs
of muscles the opercular valves are held down with quite surprising
force The valves can be raised only by the action of the animals body
against the basis

In Coronula these muscles are more spread out and do not extend
down to the basis their lower portions as is likewise the case in
Tubicinella do not exhibit transverse stri and hence tend to pass
either into the involuntary class or into ligament This condition of
the muscles in the above two genera accords with the littledeveloped
state of their opercular valves In Xenobalanus there is no longer
any evidence of the muscles being collected into five or six bundles
for they are thinly and almost uniformly spread out and show in no
part transverse stri I may add that in much elongated specimens
of Balanus balanoides these muscles become in their lower part
ligamentous and destitute of stri


Branchi

In the Balanin a pair of Branchi is always present they lie on
each side in a somewhat curved position in the angle between the
sides of the shell and the basis In Pl  fig  they are exactly
covered on the further side by the body of the animal They are
attached near each other at the carinal end of the sack in a vertical
line and likewise on each side in a transverse line extending from
close beneath the spur of the tergum towards the point of attachment
of the body to the scutum In Balanus as in the figure Pl  fig
 of B tintinnabulum each branchia consists of a medial fold of
skin a little curved conformably with the sack and slightly tapering
towards its rostral and free extremity but this fold is almost hidden
by the vertical subfolds or membranous ridges themselves plicated and
subplicated which project on both sides these vertical folds are
free at their tips at their lower attached ends they are thickest
On the side nearest the wall of the shell the whole branchia has a
bilobed appearance owing to a very deep indentation caused by the
projection of the scutal lateral depressor muscle the subfolds on
this side are also more plicated The branchia essentially is an inward
plicated fold of the membranes of the sack for its outer very thin
tunic is continuous with and moulted with that lining the sack and
within it we have two layers of delicate pulpy transparent corium
united together as is best seen in Coronula by ligamentous fibres
branched at their two ends all exactly as in the corium surrounding
the sack There are here no distinct vessels any more than in
other parts of the body but a fluid could easily circulate in the
interspaces of the corium From the large size of this organ and its
simplicity of internal structure being adapted exclusively to expose
a great surface of skin to the water I do not doubt that it has been
correctly considered as a respiratory organ By the voluntary movements
of the opercular valves i e part of the carapace the water is
constantly being pumped in and out of the sack the movement indeed
may be almost compared to the heaving of a mans chest Moreover
the branchi on each side are attached so closely to the spur of the
tergum that each time the latter is moved the whole branchia must I
think be agitated and the folds opened as by the action of a lever

In our two commonest tidal sessile Cirripedes viz Balanus
balanoides and Chthamalus stellatus I have observed that when left
uncovered by water they kept the orifice of their operculums a little
open with a bubble of air within their sacks so that the orifice
was in fact closed by a thin septum of water with air beneath when
disturbed they closed their operculums with force and expelled the
bubble of air with a clicking noise which has been noticed by Dr
Coldstream and has been thought to be made by the movement of the
operculum itself Bal crenatus a deepwater species when out of
water keeps its operculum closed

     Encyclopdia of Anatomy and Physiology article Cirrhopoda

In Coronula Platylepas Tubicinella and Xenobalanus each
branchia consists of two unequal folds both plicated on both
sides in the two latter genera they extend far down the deep and
elongated sacks and hence the area of surface altogether gained is
extremely great In most of the species of Chthamalus the branchia
consist of a small fillet barely plicated in the allied Chamsipho
columna they are rudimentary forming a smooth little pouch only
th of an inch in length in Chthamalus scabrosus they are quite
aborted being perhaps represented by a slight hairy ridge but in
Chthamalus dentatus and therefore within the limits of the same
genus the branchi and this seems to me a singular fact are large
each being composed of two plicated folds as in Coronula Tapering
filaments situated near the bases of the cirri such as those occurring
in several species of the Lepadid are not found in any sessile
Cirripede but I have observed nearly similar filaments projecting
upwards and inwards at the base of the sack in several species of
Balanus and in Coronula those which I examined were simply occupied
by delicate corium and no doubt must aid in exposing a greater surface
of corium to the circumambient water

     Burmeister has given a good figure Tab  fig  of the
    branchi of Coronula but the two folds are shaded too unequally
    in his Beitrge zur Naturgeschichte der Rankenfsser

In my former volume on the Lepadid I have described the ovigerous
frna occurring on the two sides of the sack to which the
ovigerous lamell are attached by a peculiar glandular secretion
in the Balanid there are no ovigerous frna but the branchi just
described are identical with the frna in essential structure and
in position differing only in being placed a little nearer to the
carinal end of the sack and in being generally but not always
larger and more plicated seeing this and that in Alcippe lampas
and in some species of Pollicipesthe genus which comes nearest to
the Balanidthe ovigerous frna are large and are destitute of
glands and have therefore lost their normal function of supporting
the ovigerous lamell I can hardly doubt that the branchi in the
Balanid are the ovigerous frna of the Lepadid in a modified
condition a transformation of function not greater than that of the
swimming bladder of a fish into the lungs of the higher Vertebrata

     There is I conceive no foundation for the belief of some
    authors that the branchi of the Balanid are in any way connected
    with the ovaria


Thorax and Body

Parts of the body included within the shell or carapaceThese
parts Pl  fig  consist of the prominent mouth and of the
thorax c with its largely developed portion called the prosoma
c and with its appendages The abdomen is quite rudimentary
being represented merely by a small portion of membrane surrounding
the anus and sometimes inserted like a wedge between the inwardly
inflected posterior thoracic segments in only two genera Catophragmus
and Pachylasma its nature is rendered somewhat plainer by supporting
caudal appendages The probosciformed penis lies folded under the
thorax and I believe from what is seen in the anomalous genus
Proteolepas that it normally arises from the ventral surface of
the terminal point of the rudimentary abdomen The thorax is
laterally compressed the ventral surface being very narrow with
the bases of the cirri placed closely together It consists in
appearance of two very different portions one a soft more or less
rounded bag which I have called the prosoma and the other which
supports the five posterior pairs of cirri is narrower invested
with stiffer membrane and is more or less distinctly composed of
five segments These segments Pl  fig  on their dorsal and
dorsolateral surfaces are generally driven like wedges one into the
other with their points directed anteriorly on the ventral surface
the articulations are transverse The prolongation e of the thin
membrane a surrounding the anus b that is the rudiment of
the abdomen which sometimes carries caudal appendages almost divides
in appearance whether really I know not the hindermost thoracic
segment along the mediodorsal line into two parts I have given the
above drawing of these segments but with the dorsal surface much
flattened in Coronula diadema in most species of Balanus however
the wedges formed by one segment being driven into another are much
sharper on the other hand in Xenobalanus they are nearly straight and
transverse The three posterior segments are always the most distinct
the two next segments are also distinct laterally but along the dorsal
surface they become excepting in Xenobalanus and some few other
cases completely confluent The greater distinctness of the posterior
segments is conformable to what takes place in the higher Crustacea
The articulations between the segments are folded inwards and are
formed of thin membrane which in some cases as in Coronula diadema
forms a marked contrast with the much thicker stiffer and yellowish
membrane of the segments themselves in Balanus tintinnabulum
however the whole membrane of the five thoracic segments is very
thin excepting small wedgeshaped portions along the mediodorsal
line The infolded articulations between the segments supporting the
three anterior pairs of cirri at least in the Balanin are much
wider than those between the three posterior segments the former
segments with their cirri being consequently capable of being moved
further apart from each other Could there have been any doubt as to
the distinctness and reality of the five thoracic segments it would
have been set aside by the arrangement of the muscles attached to
them as will presently be described I need only add that in many
genera there are shieldlike swellings at the exterior bases of the
pedicels of the posterior cirri which I for some time thought were
the epimeral elements of the thoracic segments but I now believe them
to be parts of the pedicels of the cirri The basiexterior margin
moreover of the pedicel of the third pair of cirri in many species of
the Balanin Pl  fig  is produced as a plate thickly fringed
with fine hairs half across the dorsal surface of the thorax serving
apparently as a brush to clean the sack or to prevent the ingress of
any intruding substance

     Von Siebold and Stannius in their Anatomie Compare tom
    i p  and p  footnote consider the articulated
    probosciformed penis as an elongated abdomen a view which at the
    commencement of my examination I was tempted to admit but the
    position of the caudal appendages on the dorsal basis of the penis
    suffice I think to show that this view is not correct for these
    caudal appendages evidently correspond with those borne on the
    very extremity of the abdomen in the pupa Nor indeed does the
    position of the anus accord well with such a view

The soft rounded baglike portion of the body which I have called
the prosoma is usually separated by a notch from the five posterior
thoracic segments at its upper end it may be said to carry the mouth
and first pair of cirri The prosoma includes the main part of the
stomach and the broad ends of the vesicul seminales It is always
clothed by very thin membrane which in Chthamalus dentatus is
hairy In Tubicinella and Xenobalanus the prosoma is much elongated
being produced far down the deep sack That the prosoma is mainly
formed by a great development of that segment homologically the second
thoracic segment which carries the first pair of cirri is certain
and I should not have hesitated to have said that it was exclusively
so formed had not the first thoracic segment in the anomalous genus
Cryptophialus been developed as a distinct and free segment not
attached to the carapace showing that possibly in other Cirripedes
the dorsal half of this first thoracic segment may be concerned in the
formation of the free prosoma


Muscular System

Attachment of the Body to the ShellThe prosoma which carries the
posterior thoracic segments and in appearance the mouth is the only
part of the body which is attached to the general covering Pl 
fig  namely to the opercular valves Except through the continuity
of the lining membranes of the sack the body lies free within the
walls of the shell The area of attachment shown by a sinuous broken
line round a and b extends from about the middle of the two scuta
down to their basal margins As these valves lie obliquely across the
orifice of the shell the animals body comes to be suspended almost
in the middle of the sack The two scuta as we have seen have the
power of opening and shutting a little and are brought together by
the adductor scutorum muscle a which is generally very powerful
The body is attached to these valves round and beneath the adductor
so as to hide it until one of the valves be removed The attachment
is chiefly effected by three pairs of widely expanded superficial
muscles two pairs of which are spread over the flanks of the prosoma
and the third pair over its rounded properly dorsal surface which
lies close to the rostral compartment A fig  of the shell I
should have stated that my chief examination of the attachment of
the body to the scutal valves has been made on Coronula balnaris
and less closely on Balanus tintinnabulum Within these three pairs
of superficial muscles there are besides the adductor no less than
five other pairs of these one long pair is attached at one end to
the basal margin of the labrum e and at the other end to the
under side near to the basal margin of the scuta two other shorter
parallel pairs of muscles are attached at one end to the interspace of
membrane between the basal edge of the labrum and the adductor scutorum
muscle and at the other end to the under side of the scuta above the
attachment of the first pair the fourth and shortest pair curls close
under the adductor and is there attached at both ends beneath it The
action of these four pairs of muscles must be to draw back from the
orifice of the shell the mouth and that interspace of body between
the basal margin of the labrum and the adductor muscle This movement I
saw in living specimens The last and fifth pair of muscles is small
but of considerable length it is a diverging pair attached at the
converging end above and exteriorly to the adductor muscle and at
the diverging end low down on the under side of the scuta I am very
doubtful regarding the function of this pair Altogether we have seen
that round and within the fleshy pedicel by which the body is attached
to the scuta there are no less than eight pairs of muscles The
central space between these muscles is hollow and here many lacunal
channels seem to converge These muscles receive nerves from the
suprasophageal ganglions The interspace above alluded to between
the basal edge of the labrum and the adductor scutorum muscle occupies
a very different position according as the animals body is protruded
as far as it can be or is retracted It is homologically part of
the third cephalic segment and consequently the mouth ought to have
stood posteriorly i e above in the position figured in Pl 
fig  to this interspace yet in fact when the animal is retracted
within its shell the mouth usually lies almost directly beneath this
interspace and the adductor scutorum muscle

Besides these muscles of attachment the prosoma is furnished with
several other muscles There are superficial muscles running up
towards the basal margin of the sides of the mouth and other deeper
muscles to which I presume the movements of the mouth as a whole
are due The muscles moving the gnathites do not as far as I could
make out extend beneath the basal edge of the mouth There are also
powerful muscles giving movement to the basal segments of the pedicel
of the first pair of cirri Again there are superficial muscles
running to the next succeeding thoracic segment the anterior ends of
which are separated by a clear interspace from the lower ends of the
abovedescribed superficial muscles by which the prosoma is attached
to the scuta On each flank moreover but more deeply imbedded are
the long flexor and extensor muscles presently to be described
running to the five posterior thoracic segments The last muscle which
I need here mention is a deepseated diverging pair attached near
the upper end of the stomach on its ventral surface and diverging
from this point to the sides of the prosoma high up beneath the mouth
The probable action of this pair as well as of the three superficial
pairs of muscles by which the body is attached to the scuta is to
draw up the whole prosoma towards or from the orifice and likewise to
contract it firmly so as to serve as a fulcrum for the movements of
the five posterior thoracic segments together with the cirri which
they carry

The muscles of these five thoracic segments are numerous and powerful
they are also complicated chiefly owing to the segments on their
dorsal and dorsolateral surfaces being driven like wedges one into
the other As far as I could make out there are on each side three
superficial dorsolateral and lateral muscles generally if not
always destitute of stri which do not cross the articulations
but extend merely from articulation to articulation and of which
the function can be only to contract each separate segment and
consequently to open out the intermediate infolded articulations
the effect of this would be to separate slightly the cirri from each
othermore especially those borne on the two or three anterior
segments between which the infolded articulations are deeper or
broader There are other more deeply imbedded powerful long
dorsolateral extensor and ventrilateral flexor muscles attached
at one end within the flanks of the prosoma and at the other end to
the successive segments of the thorax The action of the former is to
straighten and stretch out the thorax of the latter or ventrilateral
muscles to retract it In tracing these muscles a fascia could be
seen to become attached to a segment and then this same fascia would
run on to the next succeeding segment the effect of this must be that
each segment can be retracted and protracted either from the prosoma
as a fulcrum or from the antecedent segment as a fulcrum we have
also seen that each segment can by the agency of the superficial
nonstriated muscles contract itself Hence these thoracic segments
are capable of diverse movements as was very evident when the shell
of a living specimen was opened By one movement in common the
whole five posterior segments could be drawn back so as to become
even partly imbedded in the prosoma lateral twisting or wriggling
movements were also quite distinct the three posterior segments
seemed to be capable of less independent movements than the anterior
segments and I observed that the more powerful flexor and extensor
muscles did not run into these three posterior segments The cirri of
course partake of the movements of the thorax and in watching in an
uninjured specimen the alternate protruding gracefully sweeping and
retracting movements of the posterior pairs of cirri it was evident
that the thorax was the chief agent in their movement Besides the
muscles now mentioned there are some immediately to be noticed which
extend from within the thoracic segments to within the pedicels of the
cirri


Movements and Muscles of the Cirri

Although the cirri have not been described it will be most convenient
here to treat shortly of their muscles Each cirrus consists of a
pedicel having a long basal and a short upper segment supporting two
multiarticulate rami The lower segment of the pedicel can be drawn
forward by an adductor muscle attached low down within this segment
and crossing at right angles at least in the case of the anterior
cirri the corresponding muscle of the opposed cirrus on the central
ventral surface of the thorax This segment can also be drawn back
by a muscle springing from the dorsolateral surface of the thorax
and running only a little way within the segment I am far from sure
that the lower segment does not possess other muscles The short upper
segment of the pedicel can be moved backwards and forwards as I saw
in living specimens independently of the lower segment this movement
being best seen in the anterior cirri which are much more often moved
independently of each other than are the posterior cirri The rami
are capable I believe of being moved backwards and forwards as a
whole by the movement of the few lower segments which are generally
more or less confluent They can also be curled up and uncurled by
the combined movement of each separate segment The uncurling seems
to separate the two rami a little laterally Each ramus at least in
the two or three anterior pairs can be moved to a certain extent
independently of the other ramus of the same cirrus and the few
terminal segments either of both rami or of one ramus are often a
little moved and curled and this is especially the case with the long
anterior ramus of the first pair without the lower segments or the
pedicel being moved

The flexor and extensor muscles which as I believe move the upper
segment of the pedicel a and b Pl  fig  are attached at
their upper ends to its basal margin and are thus enabled to draw it
a little way down within the lower segment and so move it The short
flexor muscle c which is attached at its lower end within the
upper segment of the pedicel and the longer extensor d also
attached within this same lower segment serve I believe to move the
lower partially confluent segments of each ramus as a whole In the
case of these muscles and of those last mentioned I am surprised that
the extensors b and d are not attached nearer to the exterior
and dorsal surface Other muscles e f attached at their lower
ends within the upper segment of the pedicel run up each of the two
rami to their tips with some of the fasci terminating within each
segment of these muscles the outer one f f appears to be
the extensor and the inner one e e the flexor But besides
these there are other short flexor muscles g g which run on
the anterior face from segment to segment serving to pull the
front edge of one segment within the edge of the next lower segment
These muscles differ much in plainness in the several genera they are
very distinct in Coronula In some specimens of this genus a few of
the articulations between the basal segments of the rami having been
obliterated the short muscles g g running from articulation to
articulation were absent and their presence and nature in the upper
segments thus rendered the plainer The muscular system in the several
pairs of cirri seems to be the same with the exception of the first
pair in which the muscle answering as I suppose to a namely
the flexor of the upper segment of the pedicel is much spread out at
its lower end and is there attached to the exterior surface of the
lower segment

     For a considerable time I thought that there were muscles
    going to the spines especially to those which arise from the upper
    dorsal edge of each segment but I have since ascertained that
    these are the cases within which new spines with their lower ends
    doubled like the fingers of a glove hastily pulled off are in
    process of formation

The backward and forward movements of the segments both in the rami
and in the pedicels of the cirri are apparently effected as already
noticed by the outer or inner as the movement may be basal edge of
one segment being drawn a little way down within the next succeeding
lower segment If at the same time both the inner and outer margins
of all the segments were drawn one within the other the whole limb
would necessarily be shortened and I distinctly saw a shortening
action with very slight movement in any other direction in the
first and second pairs of cirri and I think it almost certain that
this movement might be performed by the other cirri If I correctly
understand a statement of Milne Edwards this is an important fact
as he asserts that only the higher Crustaceans possess the power of
shortening their limbs

     Annales des Sciences Naturelles tom xviii  p 

When a Cirripede is alive the action of the cirri is really beautiful
from the position of the thoracic segments the posterior cirri three
pairs in the Balanin and four pairs in the Chthamalin form a sort of
semicircle facing the mouth the anterior cirri stand further apart
and are opposed in pairs to each other with the first pair pointing
beyond the mouth Together the cirri form a hollow cone not circular
but elongated with the mouth situated at the lower anterior end The
posterior cirri are protruded by the movement of the whole thorax
curled up close along the carinal end of the orifice as they are
protruded they diverge both by the movement of their pedicels and
as I believe by the separation of the thoracic segments As the two
rami of each separate cirrus are uncurled they also diverge a little
as do the double rows of spines on the segments in each ramus by their
elasticity By the movement of the thorax the cirri are then swept
towards the rostrum and lastly they are brought perpendicularly down
towards the mouth with a rapid movement which would be beautifully
adapted to catch any object floating or swimming in the water hence
I have called the action of the cirri captorial When the shell of
a Balanus is broken open the second and third pairs of cirri are
repeatedly clasped over the mouth with a convulsive movement in a
manner indicating I think that their chief function is to seize
and carry to the mouth any object entangled by the sweeping movement
of the three posterior pairs The first pair is also well adapted
to aid in this seizing action but I suspect that the long anterior
ramus likewise acts as an organ of touch warning the animal of
danger The mouth being itself moveable as a wholethe outer maxill
being capable of a backward and forward sweeping action and being
furnished with orifices apparently olfactorythe inner maxill having
more diversified movementsthe toothed mandibles overhanging the
sophagusand the sophagus itself possessing a powerful swallowing
movement are all admirably adapted to secure any prey when once
entangled by the cirri


Mouth

The mouth in the subfamily Chthamalin cannot be distinguished
from that of the Lepadid which has been pretty fully described
in my former volume In the Balanin however the labrum differs
considerably in not being swollen that is in its outer and inner
fold of membrane being close together and in having a central notch
the palpi are also larger and the lower teeth on the mandibles are
laterally Pl  fig  double as will be more particularly stated
under these two subfamilies I have given a drawing Pl  fig
 of the mouth seen from above of Balanus perforatus with the
righthand palpus d and outer maxilla a cut off in order
that the labrum e mandibles c and inner maxilla b might
be better shown the cutoff bases x x of the first cirrus on
each side are also shown In fig  we have the deep suprasophageal
cavity in Bal improvisus torn open and laid flat with the inner
surfaces of the labrum c and outer maxill a exhibited the
palpi mandibles and inner maxill having been removed Figs  and
 will presently be referred to they are parts of the mouth with
the muscles c removed of Coronula The mouth differs extremely
little in the different genera and species of the Balanid much less
than amongst the Lepadid In the Balanin the crest of the labrum
is sometimes hairy instead of having as is usual from two to six
teeth on each side of the central notch in Balanus improvisus Pl
 fig  and eburneus and in Chelonobia the crest on each
side of the central notch e is furnished with a row of finely
graduated teeth A subtriangular portion of the inner fold of membrane
of the labrum which overhangs the sophagus is always thickened and
yellowish it is also often punctured in patterns Pl  fig 
f which I believe give attachment to little muscles that serve
to open the upper end of the sophagus Opposite to this thickened
subtriangular portion of membrane the thin membrane forming the
suprasophageal cavity or the cavity surrounded by the gnathites
is strengthened by a pair of curved ribs h fig  of thickened
yellowish membrane running down from the inner bases a of the
bilobed outer maxill to the opening of the sophagus g a broad
branch from each of these ribs supports the sides of the orifice of
the sophagus and this branch almost joins on to a slightly thickened
rim or bar f which branches off from the upper part of the
subtriangular f inner fold of the labrum This structure in Bal
improvisus is represented in Pl  fig  as well as it could be
considering that the deep suprasophageal cavity has to be torn open
and then laid flat

The Palpi Pl  fig  differ little except in size in the
different genera being squarish more or less elongated or even
approaching to clubshaped in most of the Balanin they are larger
even than the mandibles of which they normally form a part Their
upper margins especially towards their free extremities are always
thickly clothed with spines and there is generally a single row
either short r or long of spines of greater length which arise
from a little above and stand almost in a parallel line to the basal
margin On the internal surface there is sometimes a row t of
very short little spines which overhang the crest of the labrum The
Mandibles Pl  fig  have from three to five teeth the lower
point or angle is generally pectinated In Coronula and its close
allies there are some small teeth intermediate between the four or
five main teeth and in these genera though members of the subfamily
Balanin the lower teeth exhibit only rudiments of being laterally
double The Maxill sometimes have a notch under the upper large
pair of spines and in Octomeris brunnea there is a double notch in
many species of Balanus the inferior corner stands up like a step Pl
 fig  a in many other genera and species the whole edge is
straight In all or almost all cases the row of spines on the middle
portion is double The Outer Maxill are always bilobed on their
inner faces and are clothed with bristles On all the gnathites the
bristles are often doubly serrated

     M Martin St Ange describes in his Mmoire sur
    lOrganisation des Cirripdes pp  and  une petite
    langue in the mouth of Lepas but I may venture to assert that
    such does not exist it is merely the point of union between the
    outer maxill M St Ange in his comparison of the mouth of
    Lepas with that of Phyllosoma compares the mandible of the latter
    with the palpus of Lepas the first maxilla of Phyllosoma with the
    mandible of Lepas and so on with the other gnathites

Muscles and functions of the Gnathites and their confluenceThe
outer maxill appear at first like a deeplylobed lower lip for they
reach over almost to the labrum Pl  fig  and thus partially
cover the other organs they are separately capable of a strong and
rapid to and fro movement by which no doubt they sweep any prey
entangled by the cirri towards the other gnathites Each outer maxilla
is furnished with a pair of muscles apparently a flexor and extensor
there is also a little muscle between the two maxill I presume for
the purpose of bringing them together The outer and inner maxill
generally stand close together and in several genera a little way
apart from the mandibles but there is no trace of any labrum or true
lower lip bounding the mandibles and orifice of the sophagus The
outer and inner maxill and mandibles are not opposed in pairs to each
other but against the thickened inner fold of the labrum almost in
the same manner as the posterior pairs of cirri are not opposed one to
the other but to the mouth

I have described pretty accurately the muscles of the mandibles in
my former volume and there given a drawing Pl  fig  of them
There are four muscles first the depressor muscle which is the
largest and is attached at its upper end to ligamentous apodemes
under the free toothed portion of the jaw and at its lower end
spreading considerably out is attached to a concavity close above the
basal margin of the labrum to understand the action of these muscles
it should be borne in mind that the mandible almost faces the labrum
In some genera as in Coronula the swelling near the basal margin
of the labrum Pl  fig  k caused by the internal concavity
for the above muscle is conspicuous The depressor muscle is opposed
by a small elevator attached to the mandible close by the depressor
thence it runs upwards and is united at its upper end to the base of
the palpus at the point where the latter adheres to the labrum I have
ventured to call this muscle the elevator from being apparently so
well fitted for this purpose but I feel some little doubt from having
observed an apparent slight movement in the palpi of living Balani
and this is the only muscle entering those organs The free part of
the mandible is articulated on a square thickened piece of membrane
forming part of the side of the mouth Pl  figs   c
and Pl  fig  a b in my volume on the Lepadid to this
square piece of membrane two short muscles are attached one above the
other and which ought in the Plate in my former volume to have been
represented crossing the depressor muscle at nearly right angles at
their further ends they are attached to about the middle of the labrum
where at least in Coronula Pl  fig  i a slight concavity
can be detected The action of these two muscles must be to draw the
whole mandible against the labrum and the depressor muscle might at
the same time draw the toothed edge downwards and thus force any prey
into the sophagus

     This is figured by Burmeister in his Beitrge zur
    Naturgeschichte der Rankenfsser Tab  fig 

The inner maxill are likewise furnished with four muscles very
nearly as figured in my former volume Pl  fig  namely two
muscles one inside and the other outside the curious apodeme which
in the Balanid Pl  fig  b is as invariably present as in
the Lepadid these two muscles are attached at their lower ends to
the outer membrane of the mouth close to its basal articulation the
outer one of these two muscles would I presume act as an elevator
and the inner one as a depressor the free part of the organ working on
the top of the apodeme like an axe on a hinge on the top of a pole
But there is also a larger depressor muscle in an analogous position
with that i e the firstmentioned muscle of the mandibles and a
fourth muscle crossing the latter depressor at nearly right angles
and attached as far as I could make out on the side of the orifice
of the sophagus close under the mandibles the action of this latter
muscle would be to draw the whole organ towards the labrum

I must not conclude my description of the mouth without drawing
particular attention to its peculiar compounded nature It is
prominent and is capable as a whole of movement it is separated
from the body by a fold or articulation which can be traced all
round It is as we have seen composed of a broad labrum and three
pairs of gnathites which latter have only their terminal segments
free and these surround a conical hollow at the bottom of which
lies the opening of the sophagus The prominence of the whole mouth
appears to result from the lateral fusion of the two basal segments of
the three pairs of gnathites I have examined the mouth of ordinary
Crustaceans and can see no trace of a structure like this That there
has been some union of the parts is indisputable for the palpi which
in ordinary Crustaceans are quite free are here firmly united to the
upper and outer corners of the labrum and indeed at first appear to
be more intimately connected with the labrum than with the mandibles
The palpus on its upper and exterior surface is in direct continuity
with the square thickened piece of membrane on which the mandible is
articulated and likewise with that side of the upper or free portion
of the mandible which faces the labrum This face of the mandible
beneath the toothed edge is hollowed out or arched Pl  fig 
p owing to the abovementioned continuity of its membrane with
that of the palpus On the lower surface the palpus is firmly united
to the lateral corners of the labrum or indeed the corners of the
labrum may be almost said to be formed by the soft swollen bases of
the palpi the point of union when viewed from the outside is seen
to form a knob on the shoulder of the labrum beneath the level of
its crest and at this knob Pl  fig  close to d several
thickened bands in the surrounding membrane unite The free portion of
the palpus stands out transversely behind i e anteriorly to in a
homological sense the labrum I suspect that the palpus possibly may
consist of two segments of which the terminal one is free and the
lower one confluent with the labrum

Before proceeding any further I should observe that figs  and  in
Pl  represent the membranes of the mouth of Coronula diadema
perfectly cleaned In fig  all the front part of the mouth has been
removed the mandible on one side the labrum with the two palpi and
the sophagus being alone left and these are viewed from the inner
side the front part however of the suprasophageal cavity has been
cut away In fig  the labrum with the sophagus has been removed
whilst the two outer maxill the righthand inner maxilla and mandible
with the exterior and basal portions d d of one palpus are
seen from the outside but in order that these parts should all be
shown the whole of the righthand side of the mouth has been spread
out for the teeth of the mandible should have stood in a vertical
line between the two outer maxill In the mandibles the free upper
part is separated by a distinct articulation from the square piece
of thickened membrane fig  c on which it is supported and
this latter is separated by a second articulation from a portion of
thickened membrane c the basal edge of which forms the third and
lowest articulation separating the mouth from the body This basal
thickened portion of membrane curls round and inwards towards the
outer maxill or front of the mouth and its terminal points sometimes
even penetrate a little way within the muscles like apodemes it is
not distinctly separated by any line or suture from the membrane which
forms the whole broad labrum so that I at first concluded that the
labrum dipped under the mandibles and thus afforded a support on which
they were articulated but this appears so opposed to all analogy
that it is more probable that the above basal thickened portion of
membrane is truly the basal segment of the mandibles completely
confluent with the labrum and it is I think not very improbable
that even a large portion of what in appearance belongs to the labrum
namely those concavities to which the muscles of the mandibles are
attached may also be part of the basal segment of the mandibles
Whether or no there really are two segments beneath the upper free
portion of the mandibles which have become laterally confluent with
other parts I must think that the square thickened piece of membrane
c represents at least one segment I may here observe that Prof
Milne Edwards seems to consider the mandible of the higher Crustaceans
as answering homologically to the haunch of the leg but according to
M Brull there ought to be two basal segments sousmaxillaire
and maxillaire bearing the proper mandible and giving rise on the
outer side to the palpusa structure which perfectly corresponds
with my view of the mandible and palpus in Cirripedes

     Annales des Scienc Nat d series Zoolog tom ii p
    

Maxill the point whence the long apodeme b Pl  fig
 and fig  arises according to Audouins views must mark an
articulation and this would separate the upper free segment from the
lower segments which I believe to be laterally confluent with the
organs on each side The thickened membrane of which the upper free
part is formed extends a little distance beyond the insertion of the
apodeme and this small portion beneath the point of insertion may
possibly answer to the square thickened piece of membrane or second
segment supporting the mandibles Beneath it a rather wide expanse of
thin flexible membrane reaches down to the basal fold surrounding the
mouth and may thus form the third segment

Outer Maxill the upper free segment has a spinose lobe a
Pl  figs  and  on its inner face which may indicate a lower
and second almost free segment Passing over this we have on the
outside of the mouth beneath the free upper segments an expanse of
membrane which on the side close to the inner maxill is perforated
Pl  fig  n by orifices which I believe are olfactory In
some species as in Bal eburneus and improvisus there is a
longitudinal medial suture in this expanse of membrane which I suppose
indicates the lateral confluence of the middle segments of the two
outer maxill A short transverse articulation or fold separates this
middle segment fig  a of each maxilla from the third or basal
segment and this latter a is separated from the body by a very
distinct fold which at least amongst the Lepadid sends inwards a
short medial tongueformed apodeme Here then we apparently have
as in the mandibles two segments under the upper free segment of
each outer maxilla laterally confluent with the adjoining organs
But I must state that in old specimens and only in old specimens of
Coronula diadema I have found under the outer maxilla an additional
transverse ridge and fold which plainly shows how easily a mere
thickening of the membrane might be mistaken for an articulation I
can however hardly persuade myself that the articulated membrane
under the free part of the mandibles which has now been figured and
described has no homological signification and the fusion of the
palpus and labrum seems too plain to be mistaken Hence I must conclude
that the mouth in the Cirripedia does truly exhibit a compounded
structure of a very peculiar nature


Cirri

There are always six pairs each biramous and multiarticulated
supported on a pedicel formed of two segments A shieldlike swelling
at the exterior bases of these pedicels often appears like another
segment but such I believe is not its nature The five posterior
pairs answer to the five pairs of ambulatory legs in the higher
Crustaceans and as in the case of the latter the three or the four
hindermost pairs almost invariably resemble each other The first
pair which is homologous with the outer maxillipeds of ordinary
Crustaceans is separated by an interval from the second pairthough
this is not the case with the legs of the pupa from which the cirri
are metamorphosed These anterior cirri are attached to the lateral
edges of the mouth namely to the thickened rim of membrane forming
the supposed basal segment of the mandibles They are capable of more
diversified movements than the other cirri the anterior ramus is
always elongated with the terminal segments more or less tapering
and is directed beyond or anteriorly to the mouth the shorter
ramus closely resembles in structure the rami of the second pair
In the Chthamalin the second pair and in the Balanin the second
and third pairs as will be more particularly described under these
subfamilies differ in structure from the posterior pairs from which
they are separated by a slight interval The number of segments on
the posterior cirri is often great amounting in Chelonobia even to
fifty Each segment normally is furnished on its inner face which
is usually somewhat protuberant with from two to rarely eight or
ten pairs of long spines or bristles placed in a double row the
two spines in the lower pairs stand nearer to each other and are
shorter than the spines in the upper pairs Between each pair of
spines there is either a single very thin bristle or often a tuft of
such The pairs are directed somewhat upwards and they diverge when
the cirri are uncurled their function is obviously to entangle the
prey On the dorsal or exterior surface of each segment close to its
upper margin there is a tuft of spines often composed of thicker
and thinner spines these I believe serve to prevent any creature
intruding within the sack On both sides of the upper margin of each
segment there is generally a row of short blunt excessively minute
spines which only deserve notice inasmuch as it is by their increase
in number and size and by the spreading out of the dorsal tufts
and lastly by the increase of the little tuft intermediate between
the pairs of spines situated in front that the segments on the two
or three anterior pairs of cirri become covered like brushes with
bristles The bristles or spines on the second and third cirri are
often especially in Tetraclita doubly and coarsely pectinated The
bristles on the pedicels follow the same arrangement as on the rami
namely being in regular pairs on the posterior cirri and crowded
thickly like a brush on the anterior cirri The segments in the
shorter ramus of the first cirrus and in both rami of the second
and often of the third cirrus are broader than the segments of the
posterior cirri they are also especially in the genus Balanus
frequently produced in their upper antelateral corners into
remarkable prolongations see Pl  fig  of the third cirrus of
Bal perforatus clothed on their inner surfaces and at their
extremities by numerous bristles The number of the segments in each
cirrus is in some degree variable and increases with age this is
likewise the case to a certain extent with the number of the spines
borne on each segment

As compared with ordinary Crustaceans I presume the two rami answer
to the tige and palpe of Milne Edwards and the pedicel as I
have called it to the two basal segments of the leg The fouet
or flabellum does not appear to be developed in any Cirripede for
though the filamentary appendages in certain genera of Lepadid might
at first be thought to be of this nature yet their usual position
beneath the basal articulation of the first pair of cirri and the
occasional presence of more than one proves I think that such is not
the case

     According to this authors new nomenclature the pedicel would
    consist of the coxopodite and basipodite the tige would be the
    ischiopodite and following segments and the palpe would be the
    exopodite the epipodite or flabellum being absent Annales des
    Sciences Naturelles tom xviii 

Though the structure of the cirri is very uniform yet we meet with
some peculiarities In Chelonobia the segments of the posterior cirri
bear only two pairs of main spines whereas in some varieties of
Balanus balanoides they carry as many as ten pairs in a longitudinal
row but in this latter species the number of these spines varies
in a singular manner from six to ten pairs In Tubicinella the
pairs of spines on the segments of the posterior cirri are arranged
so closely one under the other that they appear almost like a single
transverse row Considering the whole family the third pair of cirri
differs most in structure in the different genera Thus in Chthamalus
antennatus the anterior or outer ramus Pl  fig  is thicker
and much longer than the posterior or inner ramus the number of the
segments in one instance being in the two rami  and  in the
longer ramus the spines are arranged abnormally tending to form a
little circle round each segment and the whole ramus may be said to be
antenniformed and I believe acts as an organ of touch the relative
number of the segments I may add in the two rami and the arrangement
of their spines varies greatly in this species In two other species of
the same genus Chthamalus we have occasionally the anterior ramus in
some degree antenniformed so that this whole structure is variable
In the allied Chamsipho columna it is the posterior or inner
ramus which is antenniformed but this peculiar development is more
plainly marked in the case of the second pair of cirri than in that
of the third pair In Tetraclita porosa it is also the posterior
ramus of the third pair which is antenniformed in this third pair
and indeed in the other cirri the relative numbers of the segments
vary extremely A similar structure in the third pair but in a lesser
and variable degree may be observed in some of the other species of
Tetraclita In Balanus vestitus also we have in the third pair
an analogous structure It is scarcely possible to believe that the
circumstance of the second pair of legs which answer to the third pair
of cirri being antenniformed in certain decapod Crustaceans is an
accidental coincidence it must be owing to some special affinity in
the two groups

In Chelonobia the third pair of cirri is of unusual length compared
with the second pair but does not otherwise differ from the type
of its subfamily in Coronula and its allies on the other hand
the third pair is very short and broad as may be seen Pl  fig
 in Xenobalanus in this latter genus the front surfaces of the
segments of the pedicels fig  of the posterior cirri are extremely
protuberant almost as in Scalpellum vulgare

The last peculiarity in the cirri at all worth mentioning is in
the subgenus Acasta in which differently from in all other known
Cirripedes the anterior ramus of the fourth pair does not absolutely
resemble the rami of the fifth and sixth pairs in most of the species
the spines on this anterior ramus are more crowded together are
larger and are mingled with some short thick points and the spines
in the dorsal tufts are also longer than in the two posterior pairs of
cirri but in A sulcata Pl  fig  and in a lesser degree
in A cyathus and A purpurata the front margins of the lower
segments of this anterior ramus and of the upper segment of the
pedicel are developed into strong downwardly curved teeth it is very
remarkable that so beautiful a structure should be extremely variable
as it certainly is in Acasta sulcata


Caudal Appendages

With extremely few exceptions these are present in all the Lepadid
and Verrucid whereas amongst the Balanid they occur only in the
two species of Pachylasma and in one species of Catophragmus
these being the genera most closely allied to the Lepadid and
where consequently their presence might have been anticipated
These appendages are seated close together over the anus they are
multiarticulate each segment being subcylindrical with a few small
bristles round its upper edge


Alimentary Canal

I have not much on this head to add to what I have said under the
Lepadid As in that family the strong internal membrane of the
sophagus terminates in a remarkable bellshaped expansion Pl 
fig  g which as observed by M St Ange serves to keep
the upper broad end of the stomach expanded The sophagus is well
furnished with constrictor and radiating muscles for closing and
opening it and it is thus capable of a strong swallowing movement
The stomach runs down to the lower end of the prosoma and then
doubling back on itself extends to the anus As the prosoma is much
elongated in Tubicinella and Xenobalanus so is the stomach of
unusual length in these genera In several species of Balanus the
upper edge of the stomach is surrounded by from six to eight cca
these cca I ascertained in Balanus perforatus are branched and
penetrate a considerable way into the body and some of them at least
expand a little at their extremities Each ccum from the manner in
which it retained fluid must I think be furnished at the point
where it enters the stomach with a sphincter muscle In Tetraclita
Chthamalus Tubicinella Coronula and Xenobalanus there are no cca
but in Xenobalanus and Coronula balnaris there are longitudinal
approximate folds in the upper broad end of the stomach which would
serve to expose the food to a greater extent of digesting surface

     The presence and absence of these cca in genera so closely
    allied as Balanus and Tetraclita shows I think that these
    cavities are not of high importance and I must doubt whether Von
    Siebolds view Anatomie Compare tom i p  that these
    cca form a passage to a true or isolated liver such as exists in
    the higher Crustacea can be admitted Cca are said by Von Siebold
    to occur in some of the Entomostraca as Daphnia Argulus c

As in the case of the Lepadid a transparent structureless
epithelial tube composed of chitine containing more or less digested
food is found in specimens preserved in spirits occupying the whole
length of the stomach and where there are cca sending branched
prolongations into them It does not extend into the sophagus or into
the rectum This epithelial tube or model of the stomach filled with
excrement is expelled by the rectum whole that is in a single piece
as I observed in some living specimens of Balanus balanoides in
some specimens however of Chthamalus stellatus the excrement was
ejected perhaps from the animal being confined in fragments and the
sack thus became befouled Beneath the epithelial layer the stomach is
lined by a delicate pulpy and cellular mucus layer which easily peels
off in flakes this is surrounded by a muscular layer with the fibres
closely approximated and transverse and this by a layer of stronger
longitudinal muscles but more distant from each other Lastly
outside this double muscular layer there is a rather thick somewhat
laminated pulpy layer abounding with cells often nucleated and
frequently containing much oily matter This structure agrees closely
with Dr C H Joness account of the external covering of the
stomach in Daphnia and which he believes to be hepatic as in Daphnia
there does not seem to be any ducts I may here observe that within
the upper part of the prosoma but not immediately connected with the
stomach I have often observed much white pulpy substance permeated by
lacunal passages and exhibiting no structure except some excessively
minute cells

     Philosophical Transactions  p  Karsten Nov
    Actorum Acad Nat Cur  tab xx has excellently figured
    the testes as the hepatic glands and has indicated the ovaria
    as salivary glands it is singular that this anatomist overlooked
    the ducts which lead from his supposed hepatic glands into the
    vesicul seminales within which he observed spermatozoa

The rectum lined by membrane continuous with that investing the
thorax and seen through it in Pl  fig  c extends inwards
to about opposite the bases of the third or fourth pairs of cirri
It is longitudinally plaited the ends of the folds forming a sort
of valve where joined on to the stomach It is coated by circular
transverse muscular fibres judging from the movements the anus
itself is surrounded by a strong sphincter muscle The anus opens on
the dorsal surface of the thorax fig  b but as in the genera
in which caudal appendages occur it opens under them the orifice I
believe is homologically terminal and owes its dorsal aspect to the
aborted state of the whole abdomen and to the great development of the
probosciformed penis for the anus may be said to be situated on the
dorsal base of this organ

Altogether we see that the alimentary canal is of a very simple
structure The food judging from the contents of the stomach seems
generally to be composed of infusoria and minute animals but in the
case of Tetraclita I have been surprised at the size and number of the
included amphipod isopod and entomostracan Crustaceans in one case
together with an annelid I have also sometimes seen some confervoid
matter within the stomach


Circulatory System

On this subject I can add nothing except to express my conviction that
there is no heart or true vessels the circulation being strictly
lacunal A passage has often been quoted from Poli in which he states
that he saw a pulsating organ close above the anus but I have seen
this movement which appeared to me to be a convulsive twitching of the
sphincter muscle of this orifice The largest lacunal channel extends
down the middle of the rostral compartment of the shell and this
answers to the rostral channel down the peduncle in the Lepadid Large
nerves and the main pair of unbranched ovarian tubes Pl  fig 
leading into g extend along this channel At the basis at least in
Coronula this channel joins on to a large circular one running all
round the sack and sending off branches into the mass of ovarian tubes
and cca


Nervous System

It has been shown in my former volume that in Lepas and in some
other genera of the Lepadid there are six main ganglions one
suprasophageal and five infrasophageal or thoracic In
Pollicipes however there are only four thoracic ganglions the
last ganglion supplying the three posterior pairs of cirri with
nerves whereas in the other genera the last ganglion supplies only
the fifth and sixth pairs of cirri In this genus moreover the
lateral fusion of the ganglions has been so complete that there is
no evidence of their having been formed by the union of two Amongst
sessile cirripedes we discover evidence of much higher concentration
even than in Pollicipes My chief examination has been confined to
Coronula diadema and to Balanus tintinnabulum and in these
genera we find and the fact appears to me highly remarkable as high
a degree of concentration in the infrasophageal ganglion as in any
decapod Crustacean for instance as in Maia judging from the figure
given by Milne Edwards for all the nerves with the exception of
those connected with the suprasophageal ganglions radiate from a
single great ganglion The nervous system is moreover otherwise
complicated

     It must however be observed that according to Mr Dana
    there is in certain suctorial Entomostracans as in Caligus
    only one infrasophageal ganglion Mr Dana speaks of this as
    resulting from reduction In Cirripedes from the gradation which
    may be observed from Lepas through Pollicipes into Balanus the
    ganglions are certainly not reduced but concentrated In Van de
    Hoevens figure of the nervous system in Limulus there is seen to
    be no chain of thoracic ganglions all the nerves rising from the
    circasophageal collar but this on the other hand seems hardly
    developed into a ganglion

To begin with Coronula diadema the great infrasophageal ganglion
Pl  fig  A is seated nearly opposite to the anterior margin of
the second pair of cirri which are homologous with the first pair of
legs in the decapod Crustaceans This ganglion shows no trace of any
longitudinal medial suture its shape is hardly discoverable for it
is formed by the union of eleven principal pairs of nerves besides
several arising from its under surface in outline however it may be
said to be divided into a posterior and anterior half the latter being
somewhat heartshaped and the posterior half elongated The nerves
going to the five posterior pairs of cirri rise from the posterior
margin of the ganglion and run for some distance in a sheet parallel
and close together the pair however going to the second pair of
cirri soon branches off from the others Each of these nerves enters at
the inner and posterior margin of the cirrus to which it belongs and
at least in the case of the first pair divides into two branches as it
enters The nerves Pl  fig  r r going to the fifth
and sixth pairs of cirri are more closely united together than are the
others and appear till they branch off like a single large nerve
That which belongs to the sixth cirrus gives off opposite to the
fifth cirrus a branch s nearly as large as itself which enters
the probosciformed penis I may remark that homologically this is the
only abdominal nerve in any cirripede of the Order From the under side
of the nerves which run to the five posterior pairs of cirri small
branches are given off extending dorsally into the thorax

The anterior end of the great infrasophageal ganglion is formed by
the union of a set of nerves extending parallel in a bundle in a
directly opposite direction to those running to the five posterior
pairs of cirri These nerves consist of an outer larger pair r
entering the first pair of cirri and within these and rather dorsally
to their roots we have the circasophageal chord c c or
collar nerve between the roots of the latter and on the ventral
surface or near side of the figure there are three closely united
small pairs running to the gnathites and as I believe to the
olfactory sacks From the under or dorsal surface of the anterior
end of the ganglion two nerves larger even than the circasophageal
chord and which I shall call the splanchnic pair d d arise
and the singular course of these nerves will presently be described
between this great pair there is a single b medial nerve which
runs down and branches into that large diverging muscle which is
attached to the upper ventral surface of the stomach Posteriorly to
these three nerves we have two pairs of much smaller nerves not
figured running dorsally into the body so that we have seven nerves
rising from the under surface of the infrasophageal ganglion I
need only further add that on each side of this ganglion between
the nerves going to the first and second pairs of cirri there is a
moderately sized nerve k which appeared to run into the muscles of
the thorax a nerve in a similar position is figured by Milne Edwards
in Maia

The circasophageal chord c c nearly equals in length the whole
distance from the centre of the main ganglion to the posterior end
of the thorax This collar bows out on each side where passing the
sophagus  which is seated at its anterior end From the collar a
branch is given off on each side which I traced as far as between the
mandibles and maxill from analogy with other Crustaceans it perhaps
runs to the mandibles The collar has not a transverse commissure such
as described by Milne Edwards in the Podophthalmia and as figured by
Van de Hoeven in Limulus

The suprasophageal ganglions B present a singular contrast with
the infrasophageal ganglion in their little development size or
degree of confluence They lie directly under the basal edge of the
labrum They are laterally quite distinct and consist merely of a
slight enlargement of the circasophageal chord From the anterior
edge of each ganglion a broad nerve f extends for some distance in
a straight line and on close examination can be seen to be formed of
two nerves closely united of which the inner and smaller one after
a space appears to cross over the larger nerve both become at this
point tortuous and giving off branches m m form a plexus The
two nerves f then bend inwards and almost touching each other run
down together with the two ovarian simple ducts along the rostral
compartment of the shell No doubt if the smaller branches from these
nerves could be traced they would be seen to form a network over the
whole sack and would therefore enclose as in a cage the rest of the
nervous system These nerves correspond I believe to the two pair
of antennular nerves of ordinary Crustaceans and hence I will call
them by this name Just in front at the outside corners of the two
suprasophageal ganglions B a branch e arises which I traced
to the ends of the adductor scutorum muscle and to those several
muscles which serve to retract the interspace of membrane between the
mouth and the adductor

The pair of great splanchnic nerves above alluded to which arise from
the anterior and dorsal surface of the infrasophageal ganglion are
in Pl  fig  d d and in fig  laid flat but in nature
they first bow outwards and then penetrating deeper into the body
approach each other and running nearly parallel pass round the lower
end of the sophagus their course consequently is nearly similar
to that of the circasophageal chord with this difference that
the outwardly bowed portion is situated near the infrasophageal
instead of near the suprasophageal ganglion The splanchnic nerve
a little beyond the suprasophageal ganglion joins a plexus d
and into this plexus another large nerve e which I will call the
suprasplanchnic nerve sends branches this nerve takes an almost
semicircular bend over the ovarian glands The suprasplanchnic nerves
e e though appearing to spring from the suprasophageal
ganglions do really arise as may be seen by tracing the constituent
fibres from the circasophageal chord The plexus d lies close
to the coats of the upper end of the stomach several branches
proceeding from it run further on but I was able to trace only a few
of them one went at least in the case of Balanus perforatus to
the adductor scutorum muscle another branch spread out on the flanks
of the prosoma I strongly suspect that one branch goes to the acoustic
sack it appeared also as if some of the small branches entered the
second plexus m where the inner antennular nerve and ophthalmic
nerve cross over the outer antennular nerve

I have called the nerves dd ee splanchnic and suprasplanchnic
from their course and apparent function in supplying the viscera In
the descriptions of the nervous system of other Crustaceans I can find
nothing analogous to my great splanchnic nerve dd the socalled
suprasplanchnic nerves ee which arise from the circasophageal
chord seem to be the analogues of the ordinary splanchnic nerves
though these latter are always described as uniting into a single
medial branch The plexus d is the cervical ganglion of M
Martin St Ange who has likewise indicated the course of my
splanchnic and suprasplanchnic nerves but the plexus when viewed
as a transparent object hardly appears to me to be ganglionic in its
nature In my former volume on the Lepadid I quite misunderstood the
course of these splanchnic nerves

     Mmoire sur lOrganisation des Cirripdes p 

From the commissure between the two suprasophageal ganglions a
straight chord Pl  fig  g arises which terminates in
a small ganglion C barely exhibiting traces of being formed of
two laterally confluent ganglions This is the ophthalmic ganglion
The chord connecting it with the two suprasophageal ganglions is
accompanied by a small nerve h which runs on to the muscles round
the adductor scutorum muscle the chord is encased by much fibrous
tissue and its dissection is thereby rendered difficult From the
ophthalmic ganglion on each side a nerve i goes forth and crosses
the antennular nerve these if I could have traced them would have
been found to run as may be safely inferred from what is known in
Balanus tintinnabulum to a pair D D of eyes

In Balanus tintinnabulum the structure of the great infrasophageal
ganglion Pl  fig  A is essentially the same as described under
Coronula The great pair of splanchnic nerves springing from its under
side are here actually twice as large as the circasophageal chord
The plexus d formed by the splanchnic nerve d on each side
with the suprasplanchnic nerve e which arises close posteriorly
to the suprasophageal ganglion is here much less complicated but
is perfectly distinct and there was no appearance of the cervical
ganglion of M Martin St Ange The chord g running from between
the two suprasophageal ganglions to the ophthalmic ganglion is
nearly as large as the double antennular nerve f on each side of
it The ophthalmic chord which is accompanied in its whole course by a
small branch running to the adductor scutorum muscle terminates in a
small ophthalmic ganglion C which seems to be formed by the almost
complete fusion of two ganglions This ganglion is hardly larger than
the chord which it terminates it appeared to me to give rise to more
than one pair of nerves and a single nerve to my surprise joined the
branch just mentioned which goes to the adductor scutorum muscle

From each suprasophageal ganglion two closely united antennular
nerves f extend of which the inner one crosses over the main
or exterior nerve nearly opposite to the ophthalmic ganglion and
here forms m a plexus The structure of this plexus I was not
able any more than in Coronula to make out thoroughly but I traced
quite distinctly a long nerve i running from it into what must be
considered as the eye As in the case of Coronula I traced a nerve
on each side from the ophthalmic ganglion into the plexus where I
lost it and as here in Balanus I saw on each side of the ophthalmic
ganglion a cut off nerve of about the size of that which runs from
the plexus on each side into the eye I think we may safely conclude
that the latter or optic nerve does really arise from the ganglion here
called ophthalmic I may add that the analogy of the nervous system in
the Lepadid most strongly confirms the view of this latter being the
ophthalmic ganglion


Eyes and Vision

The optic nerve i running from the plexus to the eye is of
considerable size it runs nearly parallel to the main antennular
nerve diverging from it a little It retains nearly the same diameter
throughout and gives off only one single small inner branch It can
be traced beyond the basal edges of the scuta to just under the upper
edge of the transparent opercular membrane which unites the scuta
to the sheath of the rostrum The nerve itself at a little distance
from its further end was in a fullsized specimen ths of an
inch in diameter widening a little it expands slightly and abruptly
terminates in a circular disc about ths of an inch in diameter
see Pl  fig  The nerve just beneath this slight expansion
is coated all round by pellets of dark purple pigmentcells but not
actually united into a continuous layer These pigmentcells are
the more conspicuous from the surrounding parts being colourless I
could not make out distinctly any cornea and I suppose the external
transparent membrane to which the above slight circular expansion is
attached acts as such This description very closely agrees with that
given of these organs in Bal rugosus of Gould B crenatus by
Dr Leidy who first discovered the eye in the adult cirripede
but he did not observe the ophthalmic ganglion These eyes differ from
those in some of the genera of the Lepadid only in the greater length
of the optic nerve and by standing laterally further apart from each
other

     Proceedings of the Acad Nat Sciences of Philadelphia
    vol iv  p  I may add that I have also observed the
    suprasophageal and ophthalmic ganglions in Bal perforatus

I may here mention that I tried a few simple experiments on the senses
of Balanus balanoides B crenatus and Chthamalus stellatus
I found these three species very sensitive to shadows that is to
an object like my hand passing even quickly and at the distance of
about a foot between them and the source of the light They were
indifferent to a gradual change from bright to obscure light but
instantly perceived and drew in their cirri when my hand was passed
between the basin in which they were kept and the window even when
this was tried rather late on a dusky evening and likewise when my
hand was passed between them and a single candle I took of course
the precaution of passing my hand in other directions but this
never produced any effect These species are moderately sensible to
any vibration in the vessel in which they were kept but they were
indifferent to noises made in the air or in the water I found it
impossible to touch under water an individual shell ever so lightly
with a needle without all the immediately surrounding individuals
when several adhered together perceiving it and retracting their
cirri it made no difference whether the one touched had already
withdrawn its cirri and was motionless from this fact and from seeing
that a similar but slighter effect was produced by touching the rock
on which the specimens adhered I infer that the perception by the
others of the one being touched is communicated by vibration When an
individual was touched under water not by a needle but by a pointed
camelhair brush it generally withdrew its cirri but the neighbouring
specimens took no notice when touched by a single hair of the brush
no notice was taken unless the skin of the orifice leading into
the sack was so touched In these trials it is of course necessary
carefully to avoid intercepting the light I could not make out that
cirripedes perceived odours diffused in the water

     I find that this fact was long ago observed by Von Siebold
    Anatomie Compare tom i p 


Acoustic Organs

These are situated in the same position as in the Lepadid namely
in a slight swelling on the sides of the thorax Pl  fig 
d just beneath the basal articulation of the first pair of cirri
The orifice in Tubicinella and Xenobalanus is slightly produced or
is tubular the free part in the former genus projecting ths
of an inch The structure of all the parts is essentially the same
as in the Lepadid but I think all are proportionally larger The
external membrane of the body is turned inwards at the orifice
as a short flattened tube which widens considerably being in a
middlesized specimen of Coronula ths of an inch in width before
it abruptly terminates The meatus as I have called the sacklike
cavity which encloses the true acoustic sack or vesicle is formed
of pulpy membrane and is apparently continuous with the corium of
the whole body but by dissection it can be separated entire The
acoustic vesicle is of various shapes as we shall immediately see but
in all essential respects it is identical with the same part in the
Lepadid it is formed of the same peculiar soft elastic brownish
transparent tissue which seems to be composed of fine transverse
pillars becoming towards the outside fibrous and at their inner ends
appearing when viewed vertically from above like hyaline points In
Coronula diadema I observed on the outside of the acoustic vesicle
some excessively minute bristles only ths of an inch in length
seated on little eminences I examined carefully the contents of the
vesicle in this species in specimens well preserved in spirits and
there was nothing within but a very little thin pulpy fluid and a
few yellowish nucleated cells here and there aggregated into small
groups In Coronula the flattened acoustic vesicle is elongated with
a somewhat sinuous but not very irregular margin Pl  fig 
and is without any ridges on the surface its neck or orifice projects
at right angles to the elongated portion which stands obliquely to
the tubular orifice of the meatus In a moderatelysized specimen of
Coronula diadema the elongated portion of the acoustic vesicle was
ths of an inch in length In Tubicinella the acoustic vesicle
is heartshaped with the neck attached to its broader end and the
surface is covered by zigzag ridges In Balanus tintinnabulum fig
 the acoustic vesicle is almost square at the lower end with the
neck placed at one of the upper corners on the external surface
there is an oblique prominent ridge or fold which sends off downwards
another ridge its length in a large individual was ths of an
inch

In all these cases the acoustic vesicle is mainly attached by its
neck to the upper end of the sacklike meatus but there is likewise
a layer of soft pulpy cellular matter slightly connecting that side
of the vesicle which is opposite to the neck with the walls of the
meatus or outer sack The mouth or orifice of the vesicle is closed
by a delicate lid or diaphragm which can easily be separated and
this diaphragm is formed by the expansion of a large nerve which here
abruptly terminates In a very large specimen of Coronula diadema I
clearly made out the existence of this nerve and traced its course
for some distance from the point where the summit of the meatus and
the neck of the vesicle are joined together the nerve first runs
posteriorly and then turns inwards and doubles back or anteriorly
and I clearly followed it to the anterolateral sides of the uppermost
end of the stomach where it seemed to enter a ganglion so that I
unfortunately cut it off but found only a slight plexus with the cut
off nerve apparently running onwards with nearly the same diameter
The diameter is great fully equalling in its widest part that of
the circasophageal chord but it is very much flattened and so
has not nearly so much bulk as that nerve Before it reached the
stomach it gave off one branch which ran towards the mouth The only
nerves which from their size could I think be continuous with
this from the acoustic sack are the main branches proceeding from
that plexus d formed by the interbranching of the splanchnic and
suprasplanchnic nerves

     I have always feared that anatomists would reject my view of
    these organs being acoustic owing to the absence of otolithes
    but I observe that so high an authority as Von Siebold Anatomie
    Compare tom i p  does not believe that otolithes occur
    in the acoustic organs even of the highest Crustacea He considers
    an ampoule volumineuse a parois mince remplie dun liquide
    transparent and a membrane tympanique though having a fissure
    in the centre as sufficient I may here remark that the nerve
    proceeding from the acoustic vesicle in Cirripedes and apparently
    running to the splanchnic nerve may easily be placed in connexion
    with the antennular nerves by the second plexus m in figs 
    and  pl  I should infer from Von Siebolds remarks on his
    ampoule volumineuse in the higher Crustacea that my acoustic
    vesicle answered to the labyrinth in higher animals


Olfactory Sacks

I can add nothing to the account given of these organs under the
Lepadid I saw them in all the genera which I examined for this
object In Coronula diadema the orifices are large they are seated
in the usual position Pl  fig  n in the confluent segments
beneath the free part of the outer maxill and somewhat exteriorly
or as near as possible to the inner maxill In no sessile cirripede
are the orifices produced or tubular as is the case with several
genera amongst the Lepadid I failed as heretofore in tracing with
certainty the nerve which appears to enter the base of the sack to
its ganglion


Male Organs of Generation

All the Cirripedes of the family we are now describing are bisexual
or hermaphrodite and no instance has been observed of the presence
of males or complemental males I have very little to add to the
observations made by M Martin St Ange and R Wagner and to
those given in my former volume The testes seem always to be confined
to within the thorax including the prosoma With their ducts they
resemble clubmoss or stags horns with the extremities a little
enlarged a figure of a small portion from Balanus perforatus is
given in Pl  fig  It is quite surprising how like in structure
and appearance the branching ovarian tubes often are to the testes with
their ducts but the latter are of smaller diameter Two main ducts
generally unite just before entering the broad often reflexed end of
the vesicula seminalis in Coronula balnaris however I observed
four ducts entering this receptacle The two vesicul seminales lying
within the thorax and prosoma are usually very long and tortuous they
are formed of a thin inner tunic which is strengthened by thicker
reticulated lines and of an outer layer of transverse fibres which
are either elastic or probably muscular as they serve to expel
the contents with force when the end is cut off The inner tunic is
prolonged up the probosciformed penis at the base of which the two
vesicul unite The contents of the vesicul are commonly pulpy and
cellular and from the cells the spermatozoa are developed soon after
their development they are as it appears expelled

     The Report on M Martin St Anges memoir was laid before
    the Academy of Sciences July   so that I suppose it was
    read previously to this date R Wagners paper was published
    in Mllers Archiv  p  Burmeisters Beitrge
    zur Naturgeschichte der Rankenfsser was published this
    same year  so that these three authors published almost
    contemporaneously

     A far better figure is given by Karsten Nov Act Acad Cs
    Nat Cur  Pl  figs    but under the erroneous
    supposition that these organs were hepatic

     In Conchoderma aurita the ducts as shown by Burmeister
    Beitrge c tab ii fig  unite half way up the
    probosciformed penis

I have seen the spermatozoa in Balanus crenatus perforatus and
balanoides and in Chthamalus stellatus The cells from which the
spermatozoa are developed and which are often found in vast numbers
within the vesicul are on an average about th of an inch in
diameter The spermatozoa differ remarkably within the vesicula of
the same individual according to their state of development I have
observed in B perforatus and in the Chthamalus that the shortest
and therefore I presume the youngest Pl  fig  a had a
globular head with no projection in front as they increased in size
this head became less in diameter and a short tapering filament a
b like the tail projected out of it This anterior filament does
not lie in exactly the same line with the posterior filament which is
straight as an arrow In Bal crenatus the anterior filament was
th of an inch in length and the posterior filament th
giving a total length of th in the longest and best developed
specimens of Chthamalus stellatus the nodular enlargement was
much elongated and spindleshaped and not above half the diameter
it had in the earliest stage the posterior filament measured from
the front of the enlargement this consequently being included was
th in length and the front part only th giving a total
length of ths of an inch These observations agree pretty well
with Kllikers but this author states that perfectly developed
spermatozoa are absolutely without any nodular enlargement if this be
the case I have never chanced to see the spermatozoa in their perfect
condition Mr Bate also figures some Pl  fig  c in this
state without any enlargement

     Annales des Sciences Naturelles d series tom xix p
     Klliker refers to Wagners paper on the same subject in
    Wiegmanns Archiv  part ii pl iii fig  He also refers
    to Von Siebolds observations Mr C Spence Bate has figured in
    the Annals and Magazine of Natural History vol viii d series
     the spermatozoa of Balanus balanoides perforatus and
    of Verruca Clitia Strmia and of these I have given copies
    Pl  fig 

The probosciformed penis lies adpressed on the under side of the
thorax with its apex generally projecting between the first and second
pairs of cirri It presents the same ringed or articulated structure as
in the Lepadid it arises from an unarticulated projection or support
which also forms the posterior border to the anus This support
often terminates as first observed by Poli in a very sharp point
but this point cannot be of much functional importance for though
present in Balanus balanoides it is absent in the closely allied
B crenatus in Tubicinella there is only a rudiment of this point
I have not observed it in any member of the Chthamalin The strong
transverse and longitudinal muscles with which the penis is furnished
are attached to this support The apex or orifice of the penis is I
believe invariably surrounded by some bristles Its length varies
much according to its state of contraction or relaxation and this
again I believe is dependent on the condition of the male secreting
organs In a small specimen of Elminius modestus the penis was
actually thrice as long as the whole thorax including the prosoma
in Pachylasma and in Octomeris angulosa the penis is very short
being equal only to once and a half the length of the pedicel of the
sixth cirrus in Octomeris brunnea the unarticulated support is
much elongated being as long as the pedicel of the sixth cirrus in
which respect this organ resembles that of Ibla quadrivalvis and of
no other Cirripede From the attachment of the penis at the posterior
end and on the under side of the anusfrom the position of the caudal
appendages where such occur over the anusfrom the position of
these same appendages in the pupaand lastly from the position of
the papillalike penis in the abnormal Proteolepas I infer that
homologically the penis is situated at the apex of the abdomen on
its ventral surface and that consequently this organ cannot be
considered as the abdomen itself in a modified condition


Female Organs of Generation

I have scarcely anything to add to the statements in my former volume
These organs consist of the true ovaria or glandular bodies seated
on each side not far from the basal edge of the labrum of the main
or unbranched ovarian ducts and of the Pl  fig  g ovarian
branching tubes and cca I traced distinctly in Balanus Tetraclita
and Coronula the two main ovarian ducts running from within the
prosoma to the layer of inosculating branching ovarian cca which
overlie the basis In Coronula diadema one of these main ducts was
th of an inch in diameter Though I traced these ducts near to the
grapelike glandular masses which I cannot doubt are the true
ovaria I did not succeed in tracing them into actual connection As
in the Lepadid these ovarian glands lie on the sides near the basal
margin of the labrum and almost under but rather to the outside of
the antennular nerves The branching and inosculating ovarian cca
form a layer which corresponds with the mass filling up the peduncle
in the Lepadid In Tetraclita they do not cover the whole basis but
are confined to the circumference they however likewise extend
up between the two layers of corium round the walls of the shell
and chiefly in the interspaces between the depressor muscles of the
opercular valves In Chelonobia they enter between the radiating septa
in the thickness of the walls in Coronula diadema they extend from
over the basal membrane into the six large square chambers Pl 
fig  v separating the radii and al in Tubicinella they are
confined to the basis in Xenobalanus they form a layer over the basis
and likewise round the upper part of the pedunclelike body which
answers to the shell of other sessile cirripedes

     These are well described in Lepas by R Wagner in Mllers
    Archiv  p  Von Siebold I observe refers to Burmeister
    as the first author who discovered the ovarian cca within the
    peduncle I had thought that M Martin St Ange had a prior claim

     These are obscurely figured by Karsten Nov Act Acad Cs
    Nat Cur  Pl  fig d as salivary glands they were
    so considered by Cuvier and M Martin St Ange I may observe
    that salivary glands have not been positively recognised in any
    Crustacean

As after the most careful and repeated examinations of various
Lepadid I was convinced that there were no oviducts so I have
come to a similar conclusion in regard to the Balanid the ova
being brought to the surface by the formation of a new membrane
round the sack underneath them and by the subsequent exuviation of
the old membrane The ova are united together by a most delicate
tunic investing each egg the ovigerous lamell being thus formed
as in the Lepadid In the cases of Chthamalus stellatus Balanus
balanoides and Platylepas decorata I saw a pair of very distinct
but fragile lamell In Xenobalanus the two ovigerous lamell form
two subcylindrical packets pointed at their lower ends and often
cohering There are no ovigerous frna for the attachment of the
lamell the ova being sufficiently well retained as it would appear
by the wellclosed shell I have elsewhere stated my full belief that
it is the ovigerous frna which have been metamorphosed into the
branchi of the Balanid Most sessile cirripedes breed when very
young and I have every reason to believe that they breed several times
in the year The ova are ovate and vary in length from th of
an inch in Chthamalus to th in some species of Balanus in
which this greater length was owing to a more elongated shapeup to
th in some other species of Balanus The ova are wonderfully
numerous especially in the genus Coronula

I may here mention the singular case of some elongated specimens
of Balanus balanoides from Tenby in South Wales some of these
presented nothing abnormal but in no less than seven specimens the
two three or four posterior pairs of cirri either on one or both
sides were in an almost rudimentary condition being of small size
and having a shrunk and wasted appearance In six out of these seven
specimens the probosciformed penis was quite short and abruptly
truncated as if from abortion By cutting off the truncated apex and
cleaning the external tissue I ascertained that it was imperforate
apparently in all the cases and I am certain of this fact in several
of the cases In three of the specimens I examined the vesicul
seminales in one I found some spermatozoa but cohering together
in a peculiar manner in the second there were no spermatozoa and
in the third the vesicul were shrunk empty and quite rudimentary
in size So that these three individuals certainly could not have
impregnated their own eggs nevertheless within the shell of these
very three there were perfectly developed larv I am led to conclude
from this fact that adjoining specimens in a perfect condition had
by means of their long probosciformed penis effected the fecundation
of their imperfect neighbours I need only further add that some
out of the above six specimens with more or less aborted cirri and
imperforate male organs were infested by a peculiar parasite allied
to Bopyrus and that these specimens did not contain ova

     I have given a short notice on this parasite in my former
    volume on the Lepadid in a footnote to p 


Metamorphoses and Homologies throughout the Order of Thoracica

In my former volume the metamorphoses were described under three
principal stages or heads but whether these three included all
the main changes I was then hardly able to conjecture But now
I have reason to believe that such is the case for in the genus
Cryptophialus belonging to the Abdominalia the whole course of the
metamorphosis from the egg to the pupa takes place within the sack of
the parent and I found when having on the coast of South America
numerous specimens to examine that the egglike larv Pl  fig
 could be naturally grouped into two main stages but with many
transitional intermediate grades answering to the successive moults in
the first stage of ordinary larv before they passed into the third
or pupal stage And the first two stages in these egglike larv of
Cryptophialus clearly seem to correspond with the first two stages in
ordinary larv for in both the chief changes are the shortening of
the terminal projectionthe increase in size and approximation on the
ventral surface of the anterior horns or cases for the antennand the
compression of the whole body In all members of the Thoracica the
metamorphosis seems to run a remarkably uniform course The larva in
the first stage undergoes several moults and slighter changeshow many
is not knownbefore arriving at its second main stage which has been
observed only in one single instance and judging from Cryptophialus
this second stage passes abruptly by one moult into the pupal stage
and this certainly passes abruptly into the Cirripedial or mature
stage


Larva First Stage

The larv in this stage are known amongst the Balanid in Balanus
Pyrgoma Coronula Platylepas and Chthamalus and these genera include
all the principal forms Amongst the Verrucid they are known in its
one genus Verruca Amongst the Lepadid in Scalpellum Ibla Alcippe
Lepas Conchoderma c and in all these genera the larv present no
important differencehardly any difference which could be viewed as
generic were these larv independent animalsas may be inferred
chiefly from Mr C S Bates descriptions The abstract given in
my former volume was not accompanied by any illustrations and I have
consequently here given Pl  fig  a view of the larva in the
first stage before moulting of Scalpellum vulgare the natatory legs
are not drawn with accuracy only the relative position of the several
organs having been carefully attended to I have also had copied from
Mr Bates memoir a figure of the larva Pl  fig  of Balanus
balanoides in its first stage before moulting with its ventral
surface exhibited and another figure with a few trifling alterations
made after examining specimens most kindly sent me by Mr Bate of
the larva of Chthamalus stellatus fig  in its first stage but
after moulting once It should be observed that Mr Bate has given
a drawing of the larva of this latter cirripede in the first stage
before moulting and it does not differ essentially from that just
referred to fig  of B balanoides but is rather more fully
developed These drawings suffice to show the character of the larv
in the first stage both before and after the first moult and even
after the second moult throughout the Order of Thoracica The larv
sometimes undergo their first moult within the sack of their parent as
I have been informed by Mr Bate and as I have observed in Coronula

     Annals and Magazine of Natural History vol viii d
    series  Plates   and 

I will now make a few remarks on these larv in the first stage before
and after the first moult supplemental to those in my former volume
Their shape is oval and the whole dorsal surface is evidently covered
by a carapace It is remarkable that the body exhibits no distinct
articulations those given by Goodsir being certainly erroneous
Commencing at the anterior extremity the eye varies considerably in
the state of its development in Platylepas decorata it is nearly
circular and in most of the specimens very distinct whereas in
the allied Coronula balnaris before the first moult it is very
imperfect but afterwards square and of considerable size In Balanus
galeatus in the immature larv dissected out of the egg the cellular
matter which was in process of conversion into the eye formed a
transverse band obscurely divided into two portions and this seems
to indicate that the single eye is in fact formed by the confluence of
two eyes In Scalpellum vulgare this heartshaped eye lies between
a Vshaped muscle the nature of which I cannot understand and which
has not been represented in Pl  fig  a I need only further
add that in Chthamalus stellatus after the first moult the eye
exhibits in specimens sent me by Mr Bate some appearance of tending
to become double

     Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal July  Pl  

Arising posteriorly to the eye we see in Scalpellum vulgare a
pair of minute curved horns b directed backwards and within
these horns I distinctly saw an articulated organ These horns are
difficult to be distinguished and probably could not be made out
previously to the first moult in any larva of less size than that of
Scalpellum vulgare But after the first moult Mr Bate has seen in
two species of Balanus in Verruca and in Chthamalus fig  b
a pair of articulated organs in this same position evidently now
forming antenn and directed anteriorly and free from any envelope
It is somewhat important as we shall presently see to bear in mind
that these antenn first appear within an envelope or horn and that I
detected that they included an articulated organ before I had heard
of Mr Bates observations These antenn from their small size from
being seated internally with respect to the horns containing the other
pair of antenn and from the position which the latter assume in the
later stages of the larva I believe to be the first or anterior pair
Their position in appearance posteriorly to the large lateral horns
containing the second pair of antenn is probably due to the anterior
cephalic segments having been driven inwards the truncated outline
of the front of the head and likewise probably the position of the
mouth between the bases of the natatory legs being thus caused

In this same larva of Scalpellum vulgare within the great lateral
horns just alluded to fig  c filiform organs supporting rows
of spines could be distinguished and these appeared to me to be
antenn These horns or cases resemble in structure the smaller pair
just described they arise from the ventral surface and can hardly
therefore be considered as prolongations of the carapace After
the first moult fig  c they are seen to have increased much
in length in some cases they are of considerable length before the
first moult as in Lepas in the Balanid they seem to be generally
shorter than in the Lepadid but in Balanus galeatus I found them
one third of the entire length of the animal Whilst within the
egg these horns are adpressed laterally to the body and so point
posteriorly afterwards they project rectangularly from the sides
or as in Scalpellum vulgare are directed somewhat anteriorly As
in the larv of all ordinary Crustaceans as yet known the antenn
are amongst the earliest developed organs and as the first pair of
natatory legs Pl  figs  e in these Cirripedial larv
might so very naturally be thought to be antenn as has been remarked
to me by Mr Dana both from their structure and from their position a
little anteriorly to the mouth I am well aware that to prove my view
correct namely that these horns are the second pair of antenn in
process of formation it is not sufficient merely to have seen organs
resembling antenn within them nor is it sufficient to advance the
strictly analogical fact of the firstmentioned pair of antenn which
in Scalpellum indisputably appear in their earliest condition within an
envelope or horn Further evidence is required and this is presented
in Cryptophialus in which the lateral horns of the egglike larva in
its first stage Pl  fig  can be actually followed step by
step until in the second stage fig  just before passing into
the pupa the horns are seen to have become larger and more nearly
approximated to each other on the ventral surface and whilst in this
condition I several times dissected out the prehensile antenn of the
future pupa with every character perfectly recognisable Hence I
cannot doubt that in the larv of Cirripedes the law of development is
that in their very earliest condition the small first pair of antenn
are enclosed in cases and that the large second pair remains thus
enveloped until the pupal stage This conclusion we shall immediately
see is in harmony with the late development of the succeeding
appendages or organs of the mouth which certainly do not appear in the
first larval stage and are not known to appear even till after the
final metamorphosis

     According to M Joly Annales des Sciences Naturelles d
    series tom xix p  in the larva of the macrourous Caridina
    the natatory legs appear before the gnathites or parts of the
    mouth so that in ordinary Crustaceans there is no invariable order
    of development from the anterior towards the posterior end of the
    body as has sometimes been supposed

The mouth is more or less probosciformed Pl  figs  d
differing considerably in this respect in different species of the
Lepadid and this probably is due to the larva being born in a more
or less mature condition Its exact position likewise varies for it
arises either between the first or second pairs of natatory legs It is
known from Mr Bates observations to have the power of movement It
is directed posteriorly the sophagus extending anteriorly both these
directions being the same as in the mature cirripede Certainly during
these early stages there are no jaws or gnathites but the margin
answering to the labrum is furnished with some short thick sharp
spines and with hairs In Scalpellum vulgare the orifice of the
sophagus seems to lie rather beneath the upper prominent spinose edge
which as just remarked probably answers to the labrum but this is
one of the species in which the probosciformed mouth at least before
the first moult is not much developed

We come now to the three pairs of natatory legs the first Pl 
figs  e has throughout the order only one ramus whereas the
two succeeding pairs f g are biramous I must here remark that
the straight and strong and the curved plumose spines with which
these limbs after the first moult become furnished now appear to me
as more probably prehensile rather than masticatory as I imagined in
my former volume That these spines are important organs to the larv
I do not doubt With regard to the homologies of these three pairs of
limbs my first impression was that they were the mandibles and the
two pairs of maxill in their earliest condition but I consider this
view as quite untenable for several reasons viz the wide interval
between their bases and the mouth itselfthe somewhat variable
position of the mouth with respect to the legsand the position
which the latter occupy in the second larval stage A far more
tenable view is that these three pairs of legs are the three pairs
of maxillipeds in their earliest condition in accordance with the
view of M Joly on the nature of the three very similar pairs
of natatory legs in the larva of Caridina a macrourous Crustacean
But in Cirripedes the three pairs of natatory legs in the larva
in the first stage are apparently the very same as the first three
pairs in the larva in the second stage and in the pupa And in the
pupa the first three pairs which certainly correspond with the first
three pairs of cirri in the mature animal seem to me for reasons
presently to be assigned to be the second third and fourth thoracic
limbs Hence I am led to the conclusion that the first pair of legs in
the larva in the first stage are homologically the second thoracic
answering to the third pair of maxillipeds in the higher Crustaceans
and that the two succeeding pairs are the third and fourth thoracic
limbs to be succeeded in the pupal stage by the fifth sixth and
seventh thoracic appendages

     Mr Dana moreover has remarked Crustacea United States
    Exploring Expedition p  that he knows of no instance of
    a mandible becoming so completely a leg as to lose wholly the
    mandibular function even of its basal portion

     Annales des Sciences Naturelles d series tom xix 
    p  M Jolys observations were made on the Caridina I owe to
    the great kindness of Mr C Spence Bate an examination of some
    larv of the allied genus Hippolyte varians and I found on
    dissection the view of M Joly that the three pairs of natatory
    legs are the maxillipeds so far strongly confirmed that they
    followed closely with equal intervals the mandibles and two pairs
    of maxill The first pair of natatory legs in Caradina in its
    earliest condition within the egg is uniramous like the first
    pair in the larv of Cirripedes There is one fact which seems
    rather strongly opposed to the view of these three pairs of legs
    in the larv of the macrourous Crustaceans being the maxillipeds
    which is that Capt Du Cane Annals of Nat Hist  vol
    ii pl  and  observed only three pairs of limbs in process
    of formation posteriorly to the first three pairs whereas there
    should be found in accordance with M Jolys view five pairs i
    e all five pairs of ambulatory legs This one fact countenances
    the view which I hold on the nature of the legs in the larv of
    Cirripedes during their early stages namely that they are the
    second third and fourth thoracic limbs to be succeeded by only
    three additional pairs

Lastly behind the natatory legs on the ventral surface Pl 
figs   i the body is much produced and terminates in a
horny fork which after the first moult fig  i becomes much
elongated Anteriorly to this fork on the ventral surface there
is another fork l and again above this I could distinguish in
Chthamalus stellatus after the first moult another fork m
or at least a pair of short thick spines From the structure of the
forked abdomen in the known larv of the Podophthalmia I presume
that this portion of the body is the abdomen of the young Cirripede
but it is not at all plainly articulated After the first moult the
posterior end of the carapace h which is always pointed becomes
much elongated and serrated on both sides reminding one of the
structure of the carapace of the socalled Zoea or larva of certain
Podophthalmia Situated under this posterior prolongation of the
carapace there is a swelling n with long hairs on both sides
which apparently lies on the dorsal surface of the spinose and forked
abdomen here when the larva is compressed the cellular and oily
contents of the body burst forth and I suspect that this swelling
is the anus for it is known from the researches of Rathke that
the anus in the higher Crustaceans opens during the earliest periods
dorsally

     I suspect that the account given by Goodsir Edinburgh New
    Phil Journal  of the posterior points of the carapace and
    abdomen in the larva of a Balanus is not quite accurate

     Annales des Scienc Nat tom xx p 


Larva Second Stage

I have given from Burmeister a lateral view Pl  fig 
of the one single specimen ever observed of a larva in this stage
belonging as is supposed to the genus Lepas The carapace has now
greatly altered its character The two fleshy projections as so
called by Burmeister by which the larva adhered to the seaweed
were supposed by this author to include the great prehensile antenn
of the pupa from my observations already alluded to on the two
projections Pl  fig  in the closely analogous egglike larva
in the second stage of Cryptophialus by which it also adheres I
have not the least doubt that this is the case The small internal
and anterior pairs of antenn are as it would appear now aborted
The eye according to Burmeister has commenced becoming double
but the two approximate eyes are not as yet compound The mouth is
probosciformed m and does not differ much from its condition in
the first stage no gnathites were observed by Burmeister and they
could not be expected to be present for they are not found even in
the pupa The mouth which in the larva in the first stage differs in
different genera in being more or less advanced forward here stands
some way anteriorly to the natatory legs as in the pupal condition
The first pair of legs is uniramous and the two other pairs biramous
this fact together with the number of the legs in this second stage
being still three and their structure being not very different
leaves little doubt on my mind that we here have the same three pairs
as during the first stage The abdomen has become much shortened but
still space is left for the development in the pupa of the three
posterior pairs of legs I may here remark that in the pupa the
anterior natatory legs have become like the others biramous but yet
as it were for the purpose of showing their metamorphosis from the
uniramous legs of the earlier stages they have their bristles arranged
rather differently from those on the succeeding five pairs of legs

Larva in the Last or Pupal Stage

I have given a lateral view of the pupa of Lepas australis Pl 
fig  illustrative of the description in my former volume the
specimen is drawn as if transparent and it was to a certain extent
thus rendered by boiling in caustic potash A sketch of the position
of the young Cirripede within the pupa was made by the camera At
first the drawing will perhaps hardly be comprehended the darker
shaded portion to the left of the letter b shows the extent of the
sack with the included thorax and natatory legs of the pupa to the
right of the same letter if we do not consider the young included
Cirripede the only organs distinguishable in the mass of cellular and
oily matter are the alimentary canal the cementglands t i
e the incipient ovaria and the cementducts t which enter the
antenn A view is also given fig  of the ventral surface of the
pupa and a transverse section fig  of the carapace taken close
to the eyeapodemes On comparison with the larva in the second stage
the changes in external appearance and structure are not very great
the prehensile antenn are freed from their cases the two eyes stand
further apart the three posterior pairs of legs have been developed
and a small abdomen has become distinctly separated from the thorax
Before proceeding to make a few additional remarks and corrections to
my former description of the pupa it will be advisable on account of
the importance of the subject to discuss the homologies of the limbs

From the presence of eyes and of two pairs of antenn in the larva
during its earlier stages the front of the head consists in
accordance with all analogy of three segments the mouth likewise
from being formed of three gnathites which can be detected by
dissection in the pupal state consists also in accordance with all
analogy of three segments making altogether six segmentson the
nature of which I apprehend no objection will be raised In two out
of the three orders into which Cirripedes may be divided the mouth
is succeeded in the adult animal by eleven most distinct segments
of which the first i e the seventh cephalic differs from the
succeeding seven thoracic segments and these seven again differ
from the three abdominal and terminal segments Hence it must be
admitted that as far as the cephalothorax of the archetype Cirripede
is concerned it consists like that of the archetype Crustacean
of fourteen segments of which eight succeed the firstnamed six
that form the mouth and front of the head and that with the three
abdominal segments there are altogether seventeen segments In the
order Thoracica however which includes all common Cirripedes both
in the pupa and in the mature animal only six thoracic segments
with their appendages succeed the mouth two having been lost and
the question arises which are these two whether the seventh and
eighth or the thirteenth and fourteenth i e the two terminal
thoracic segments for there is no reason to suspect any other
segments of having disappeared In my former volume I inferred
without sufficiently entering into my reasons that it was the seventh
and eighth i e the last cephalic and first thoracic segments
which had disappeared but I now find that Mr Dana believes
that in ordinary Crustaceans the abortion of the segments with
their appendages almost always takes place at the posterior end of
the cephalothorax Nevertheless after due deliberation and fresh
examination of the pupa I must retain my former opinion that it
is the last cephalic and first thoracic segments which have either
coalesced with the others or wholly disappeared In the pupa the
mouth although functionless has its place most plainly marked by
being slightly prominent and by the presence of a sort of labrum and
of a shrivelled sophagus round which latter the gnathites and the new
sophagus of the future young cirripede are in process of formation
Now between the mouth of the pupa and the first pair of natatory legs
there is a space of membrane equalling when stretched out the three
succeeding thoracic segments in length and breadth this interspace I
conceive must have some homological signification here then we have
at least an appearance of the abortion of appendages whereas at the
posterior end of the cephalothorax no such appearance is presented
Moreover this interspace of membrane is divided nearly in the middle by
a most conspicuous fold which on the view here adopted would mark
the separation of the seventh cephalic from the eighth thoracic
segment and the interspace and fold are thus simply explained Lastly
I have shown in the Introduction p  that the first and five
succeeding pairs of cirri of the mature Cirripede present certain
small but significant resemblances in structure and in the origin
of their nerves with the outer pair of maxillipeds and with the five
pairs of ambulatory legs in the Podophthalmia which resemblances are
all futile if the cirri belong to the th th th th th and
th segments of the cephalothorax or those immediately succeeding
the mouth but are full of meaning if the six pairs of cirri belong
as I believe to the th th th th th and th segments or
the six posterior segments of the cephalothorax

     Crustacea United States Exploring Expedition p 

Before commencing on details I may premise that I have examined
the pupa of Lepas australis pectinata fascicularis and
anatifera of Conchoderma virgata partially of Dichelaspis
Warwickii of Ibla quadrivalvis and of Alcippe lampas and in
the Balanid of Balanus balanoides and Hameri In the pup of all
these genera there is a most close general agreement in structure
excepting in minute details I was surprised to find exactly the same
slight differences in the spines on the first pair of natatory legs
as compared with the succeeding pairs in Balanus Hameri as in
Lepas The abdomen and caudal appendages of the pupa in the abnormal
Alcippe as we shall presently see offer the only marked exception
to this uniformity of character throughout the Thoracica The outline
of the carapace or shell is usually not so blunt at the anterior end
as in the pupa of Lepas australis Pl  fig  more commonly
the shape is that of the pupa of Alcippe Pl  fig  In Lepas
pectinata the two posterior points of the carapace are produced into
two short spines The surface of the carapace in L australis is
lined as represented in fig  the colour of this species when alive
was blue in L fascicularis the surface is punctured in L
pectinata it is marked with curious points of various shapes often
starshaped in parts reticulated and confluent along the dorsal
margin and in parts lined in B balanoides it is very obscurely
punctured and in B Hameri the punctures pass into lines The whole
of what is externally visible consists of the carapace for this is
produced not only backwards so as to enclose the thorax and abdomen
with their appendages but also forwards so as to overhang the whole
front of the animal and the prehensile antenn in Lepas Ibla
Balanus and probably in all the genera can be retracted within its
lower edge The protection afforded by the carapace to the antenn
is aided by two crests Pl  fig  c parallel to this lower
edge The whole sternal surface is very narrow fig  and is
likewise protected by the carapace that is when the two sides are
drawn together by the adductor muscle The shell however when thus
drawn together gapes a little at the two ends at least in the case
of Lepas australis The adductor muscle if introduced in fig 
would have crossed close anteriorly to the basal margin of the mouth
and in fig  its end on the near side would have been attached under
the dark cca which enter the upper end of the stomach The adductor
is shaped almost like an hourglass and so differs from this muscle
in the mature Lepas in which it is of the same thickness throughout
I may here add that the pupa of Lepas australis could swim very
rapidly and often on one side in a circle it could walk by the aid
of its antenn but often fell over being thus locomotive and as
we shall immediately see well provided with senses it cannot be
considered as very lowly organised

     I took this species alive in the Southern Atlantic Ocean and
    mistaking it for an independent Crustacean was much perplexed
    where to class it I had overlooked these specimens when publishing
    my former volume

Acoustic OrgansCommencing at the anterior end two small elongated
orifices th of an inch in diameter e fig  Pl 
may be seen these lead as described in my former volume into a
sack with a bag suspended in it which is provided with a large
nerve and which I believe to be the acoustic vesicle These orifices
occur in the carapace either in the same position or a little more
posteriorly in the pup of all Cirripedes In Balanus balanoides
they are minute being only th in diameter but are surrounded
with a border in Conchoderma virgata they are also surrounded
by a border in Lepas pectinata the orifices are th of an
inch in diameter and are very singular from being seated on rounded
prominences causing the carapace to have two short blunt horns in
front In Lepas australis and I believe in the other species the
corium round the acoustic orifices is darkly coloured and these
coloured marks can be distinguished for some little time on the
peduncle of the young Cirripede after the metamorphosis and after
the entire organ together with the whole pupal carapace and eyes has
been moulted Knowing the connection in the higher Crustacea of the
acoustic organs and the antenn and seeing the very backward position
figs  and  of the one great pair of antenn I have always
imagined that these orifices probably marked the normal position of the
anterior pair of antenn which since the earlier larval stages have
disappeared And I now find that Schdler affirms that in most
if not in all Daphnid there is a black spot in front of the eye
which is connected with an opening in the basal portion of the anterior
antenn and he concludes that it is an organ of hearing

     Quoted by Dana Crustacea of United States Exploring
    Expedition p 

AntennThese from their present position and from standing in
their earlier stages whilst within their envelopes or horns exteriorly
to the small medial pair since aborted I believe to be the second
pair and this is Mr Danas opinion In my former description of these
very singular and important organs Pl  figs  and  I have
fallen into some considerable mistakes the two plates or segments
fig  N of which the posterior margins are inflected as apodemes
n carrying the eyes are certainly as may be clearly seen in the
pupa of Alcippe Pl  fig  and as affirmed by Burmeister
the basal segments of the antenn The second or main segment
formerly called by me the basal segment has in some species an upper
portion of the membrane of which it is composed next to the body
excessively thin and separated from the rest of the membrane composing
the segment by an oblique line fig  o which I mistook for
its articulation with the body We then come to the disc or third
segment and lastly to the fourth or ultimate segment This ultimate
segment generally has its external corner projecting up as a
step and this sometimes as in Dichelaspis Warwickii gives the
appearance of its consisting of two segments but a careful examination
of this part in Ibla in which the steplike structure is carried to
an extreme makes me believe that there is only one segment The
prehensile antenn therefore like the natatory legs are formed of
four consecutive segments of which the basal segments give rise to the
singular apodemes presently to be noticed fig  that carry the
great compound eyes This basal segment in all Cirripedes is moulted
with the eyes the three other segments invariably remaining cemented
to the surface of attachment

     Beitrge zur Naturgeschichte der Rankenfsser p 
    In tab  of this work there are good drawings of the general
    structure of the pupa of a species of Lepas probably L
    australis I believe this author was the first who made out the
    structure of the abdomen of the pupa

     In the table of measurements of the antenn of the several
    genera and species of the Lepadid p  of my former volume
    the articulation called by me basal I now know to be really
    the articulation between the basal and second segment In the
    fourth column headed Length from end of the disc to the inner
    margin of the basal articulation the term inner margin really
    applies to the oblique curved line separating the thin and scarcely
    visible membrane from the thicker membrane of that segment These
    corrections do not in the least affect the object for which the
    table was given

     In a sketch sent me by Mr Dana of this organ in the pupa
    of a Lepas from the Antarctic Ocean I observe that he divides my
    ultimate segment into two segments

In the Southern Atlantic I took some specimens of the pupa of
Lepas australis not yet attached and therefore with the muscles
of the antenn not having suffered any of that absorption which
they undergo as soon as the pupa is permanently cemented to some
floating object In my former volume I noticed a pair of strong
muscles attached to the tips of the middle forks Pl  fig 
of the apodemes and I now find two pairs attached to the bases of
the two outer forks and directed dorsoanteriorly and two other
pairs also attached to their bases but directed dorsoposteriorly
so that altogether there are five pairs of muscles attached to the
apodemes their chief function I should think was to draw the antenn
posteriorly and upwards within the carapace but as the apodemes cannot
be moved without the great compound eyes being likewise moved the
muscles probably serve a double purpose When the pup were alive I
noticed that their eyes were constantly kept in a state of vibratory
movement Flexor and extensor muscles are attached at one end to the
posterior margin of the basal segment and at the other end to the
second or main segment other powerful muscles attached to this latter
segment are prolonged by ligaments into the disc In Cryptophialus I
observed that the discsegment had a movement almost like that of the
wrist Whether any muscles enter the small terminal segment I know not

The drawing in Pl  fig  of part of the second segment of the
third or disc segment and of the fourth or ultimate segment in
Lepas australis is I think very accurate The second segment
articulates on the upper or dorsal surface of the disc and has the
articulation on one side constricted and formed of thin and flexible
membrane the little terminal segment which is turned outwards at
right angles also articulates on the disc That the disc forms a
true segment is shown clearly in Cryptophialus Pl  fig 
where the articulation with the second segment is not in such close
contact The disc is either circular as in Lepas or hoofshaped as
in Ibla in B balanoides the disc is rather hollowed out on the
inner side It has the power of adhering even to so smooth a substance
as glass placed vertically It is surrounded by a rim of transparent
membrane On the hinder margin some spines arise from the central and
more opaque part in Lepas australis there are no less than seven of
these spines fig  in Conchoderma virgata there are only four
in Scalpellum and Ibla only one When the disc is placed on the
surface of attachment these spines lie parallel to it The middle
part of the disc is almost always nearly opaque and in tracing
the cementducts from within the body of the pupa or of the young
Cirripede I in many cases traced them as far as this point but here
lost them From this same obscure central part of the disc in most
if not in all species of the Lepadid spokes radiate which sometimes
are branched and are not regular not always even resembling each
other on the opposite sides of the same individual Round the proper
membranous border of the disc a second one may be observed fig 
p which differs in shape and extent in different specimens under
favorable circumstances and very high powers it may be seen to
have a reticulated structure and to be of a very pale brown colour
towards the exterior margin the reticulations become finer and are
blended together and lost on the inner margin the substance forming
this membrane may be seen to come out of the spokes This substance
is the cement which has the power of adhering to whatever substance
it grows against and thus the disc of each antenna becomes cemented
down and soon both the antenn are surrounded by a common border of
cement which gradually increases after the metamorphosis in extent
Occasionally the cement forms little projections like short spines on
the edges opposite to the orifices of the spokes

The small terminal segment usually bears on its truncated extremity
six spines some of which are occasionally hooked in Scalpellum two
spines rather longer than the others are borne on a step some way
down on the inner side of this segment but in Lepas two spines fig
 very much longer than the others arise from the outer corner
of the extremity These two are very different from the other four
borne by this segment or indeed any other spines on the body for
they are quite flexible and are furnished with a double row of very
long straight excessively fine hairs which seem to be articulated
on themthe whole presenting a very beautiful appearance These
spines are of considerable length and in Conchoderma virgata they
even equal in length the whole antenna I can hardly doubt that these
beautiful plumose flexible spines into the thick bases of which the
coloured corium could sometimes be seen to enter serve as feelers
Owing to the facts immediately to be mentioned I erroneously stated
in my former volume that there were three long spines

In three species of Lepas in Dichelaspis Warwickii and in
Scalpellum Peronii after having torn the latelycemented antenn
from the surface of attachment I observed proceeding from the end of
the terminal segment from between the above two groups of spines what
appeared to be a long narrow ribbon with its end torn off and which
in the case of Lepas australis I fancied was one of the plumose
long flexible spines ripped open But now that I have examined some
of the pup of this species before their attachment I find as
represented in Pl  fig  v a flattened tube ending in a
blunt point and having a peculiar ringed structure I have noticed
similar appendages to the antenn of specimens just attached of Lepas
anatifera In the Dichelaspis and the Scalpellum the tube was very
long and seemed from its torn appearance to have been firmly
attached to the supporting surface In both these cases the tube came
out from within another slightly larger tube which had been broken
off close to the extremity of the terminal segment of the antenna In
the case of the Lepas anatifera the tube expanded a little after
leaving the antenna In the Dichelaspis it had exactly the same
diameter as the cementduct which could be clearly distinguished
within the two lower segments From these several facts and from the
peculiar appearance of the tube itself I believe it to be a tube of
cementtissue which thus sometimes even before the pupa is attached
independently grows outwards That the cementtissue can grow outwards
and assume definite forms we know from the singular case of Lepas
fascicularis in which the cement proceeding from several apertures
forms a vesicular float round the peduncle of not only a single
individual but often of a group of specimens we shall presently find
a somewhat analogous fact in the case of Coronula It is possible
that this tube proceeding from the extremity of the antenna may be
the channel through which cement continues to be poured forth during
the continued growth of the above Cirripedes and the manner in which
this is effected considering how firmly the end of the peduncle is
cemented down has always appeared to me a difficulty In those pup
of Lepas australis which I caught swimming about unattached it is
surprising that the disc should have been edged with cement and that a
tube similarly formed should have grown out of the ultimate segment
it shows I presume that the cementtissue will grow out whether or
no the pupa has succeeded in finding a proper object for attachment
Lastly I have felt some surprise in two or three instances in
observing some dark purple pigmentcells like those in the corium
within the terminal tube of cement and likewise within the spokes of
cement in the disc this is the only fact which causes me the least
doubt whether I have rightly determined the nature of the terminal
tube as wholly formed of cement tissue or whether it may not be
covered by an outer integument itself lined by true corium coloured
purple

Finally I may add that excepting in small details the prehensile
antenn present no difference throughout the Order I have minutely
examined them in several genera of the Lepadid and in the Balanid
I have seen them in Coronula and in several species of Balanus In
B balanoides I have examined them carefully they are smaller and
thicker than in Lepas with the second or main segment bowed outwards
carrying its usual single spine with the disc excised on its inner
margin and apparently without the spokelike vessels for the cement
and with the ultimate segment proportionably longer and carrying
I believe six spines of which two appeared to be longer and more
flexible than the other four shorter and somewhat hooked spines In
Coronula balnaris also the terminal segment is proportionably
to the others of large size Not only throughout the order but
throughout the whole Class the antenn are singularly uniform in
structure as will be seen when the last two orders are described


EyesThese present no difference except in size throughout the
class and have been sufficiently described in my former volume The
true basal segments of the antenn incorrectly designated formerly as
sternal plates or segments are separated from each other by a deep
fold and are separated from the edges of the carapace on each side
by a crest and slight fold Pl  fig  c and  these folds
and crests die out posteriorly and disappear The hinder rounded
margins of the basal segments are inflected inwards and their corners
are produced far up into the body thus forming the curious UUlike
apodemes These apodemes exist throughout the whole class and the
outer arms always carry the great compound eyes I noticed in Lepas
pectinata that the two middle arms are proportionably longer than in
L australis Owing to the presence of these apodemes and to certain
coloured marks on the adjoining corium the eyes though enclosed
fairly within the carapace yet deceptively appear pedunculated
so that even J Vaughan Thompson was thus deceived I have already
described the several muscles attached to these apodemes and the
constant vibratory movement of the eyes Whilst the pupa remains a
freely swimming animal the eyes are included not only within the
shell or carapace but as would naturally happen within the corium or
true skin lining the carapace but after the pupa has become attached
preparatory to its final metamorphosis in the state represented at Pl
 fig  not only are the muscles as before remarked which are
attached to the apodemes absorbed but so is the corium investing the
apodemes and the immediately adjoining parts of the carapace Hence it
comes that the new corium of the young Cirripede within is formed in
a deep transverse fold across the whole lower half of the animal and
the apodemes with the eyes are thus as it were rejected from within
the corium though still remaining within the carapace Consequently in
this final stage the eyes and apodemes are very conspicuous from the
outside being seen only through the transparent carapace I presume
that the eyes at this period have become functionless with the optic
nerve divided and absorbed The eyes apodemes and carapace soon
afterwards are all moulted together

The eyes of Cirripedes certainly undergo a remarkable series of
changes in the larv in the first stage there is a single eye
perhaps formed by the confluence of two eyes occupying the normal
position in the front of the head in the second stage according to
Burmeister the eye has become double but the two are as yet simple
they are now situated posteriorly to the second pair of antenn in
the third or pupal stage they remain in the same situation but have
become compound of great size and are attached to the apodemes of
the antenn in the mature and fourth stage they have moved someway
posteriorly and again have become simple of minute size and are
either confluent as in the Lepadid or tolerably far apart as in the
Balanid It must not be supposed that the eye of the mature Cirripede
is metamorphosed from the eye of the pupa for such is not the case
the new eyes and old eyes being formed someway apart and frequently
both can be seen within the pupa as in Alcippe Pl  fig  at
the same time It is scarcely possible that the eye of the larva in the
first stage can be changed into the double eyes of the second stage
though these latter may possibly be multiplied into the eyes of the
pupa as both continue to occupy nearly the same position

     Zenker in his Physiological Remarks on the Daphnid
    Journal of the Microscopical Society  p  speaks of
    a tripartite azygous eye as common amongst Crustacea and as
    occurring in conjunction with the aggregated eyes in Artemia
    Argulus c but as appearing regularly in all the Branchiopoda
    and Siphonostomata as the earliest visual organ Hence I
    conclude that this azygous eye is the homologue of that single eye
    which appears in the earliest larval stage of Cirripedes and that
    the compound eyes of the cirripedial pupa answer to the aggregated
    eyes of Artemia and Argulus c with the difference that in
    these latter genera the single eye is retained See also Von
    Siebold Anatomie Compare tom i p 

Mouth thorax limbs abdomenI have nothing to add regarding
the mouth except to confirm my former account viz that it is
functionless consisting merely of crests which project inwardly
between the gnathites of the young Cirripede and of a shrivelled
closed tube representing the sophagus In fact the mouth is a model
of the outside of the mouth of the young Cirripede I may remark that
some little way beneath the membrane answering to the labrum a pair
of ligamentous apodemes the use of which I do not know slightly
penetrate the body The degree of prominence of the mouth varies but
it is far less than in the mature animal On the limbs I have nothing
particular to add the drawing of the first pair of legs Pl  fig
 is I think very accurate I observed all the spines here figured
on the corresponding leg of the pupa of Balanus Hameri The five
posterior pairs of legs differ only in the outer ramus having five
plumose spines instead of four and one short simple spine at the
exterior angle making six altogether The legs in their natural
position fig  have only the terminal segments of their two rami
directed posteriorly and as a consequence the spine close to i
in fig  borne on the penultimate segment of the outer ramus is
directed in the same line with that segment and with the pedicel
namely anteriorly and at right angles to the natatory plumose spines
This short spine acts I imagine as a defensive weapon it has been
omitted in fig  Of the thorax I need not give from my notes any
more details The abdomen fig  is similarly constructed as far as
I have seen throughout the order with the exception of Alcippe Pl
 fig  in which it is composed of only one segment instead of
three In this genus the caudal appendages likewise consist of only one
segment with very short spines In the pupa of Balanus balanoides
the three spines borne on each caudal appendage are very much more
unequal in size than in the pupa of Lepas australis although in the
latter fig  the inner spine is considerably thicker than the two
outer Whether the three segments of which the abdomen is composed are
the three anterior or three posterior of the normal seven segments
I know not on the view that they are the three posterior segments I
presume according to analogy that the caudal appendages are borne on
the penultimate segment and that the ultimate segment is here quite
aborted

On the internal viscera I have nothing to add The cementduct is
represented in Pl  fig  t on the near side running into
the antenn and I repeatedly traced it for the duct is very strong
as far as the disc segment at the other end it joins the cementgland
t on the same side of the body This cementgland is proved by
the clearest series of facts to be converted into the incipient
ovaria and ovarian cca The cementglands in the older pup could be
traced as far as the cca of the stomach exactly where the ovaria lie
in the mature animal but in some young pup they extended further
posteriorly past the mouth between the outer and inner membranes
of the overlapping carapace I have faintly shown the course of the
stomach with its two cca at the upper end the anus lies between the
caudal appendages at the extremity above b of the abdomen At
this age there is no trace of the vesicul seminales so conspicuous in
the mature Cirripede


Young Cirripede whilst within the pupaI repeatedly succeeded in
dissecting the young Lepas australis out of the pupa and by the
previous action of boiling potash and by a strong light I was enabled
to make a camera sketch Pl  fig  of the relative positions of
their several parts The young Cirripede is drawn very faintly and is
best seen by holding the plate in the same position with the mature
animal of which a section is given in my volume on the Lepadid Pl
 fig  I may just notice how complicated are the membranes in a
longitudinal section taken at this period we have st beginning at
the back the horny tissue of the carapace or bivalve shell of the
pupa d the primordial valve z in fig  of the young Cirripede
d and th two folds of corium th the membrane of the sack of the
Cirripede th the membrane of the sack of the pupa th the outer
tunic of the thorax of the pupa th the outer tunic of the thorax
of the young Cirripede th the corium lining the latter membrane
and these nine membranes would be repeated on the opposite side of the
section if it were taken through either side of the shell or carapace
bordering the orifice

After the exuviation of the outer membranes of the pupa certain
preexisting coloured marks in the corium such as those round the eyes
and round the acoustic orifices along the ridge of the back and on the
borders of the orifice c are still retained by the young Cirripede
either temporarily or permanently so that the correspondence of part
with part of the external surface admits of no doubt Moreover the
three terminal segments of the antenn are invariably retained by
the young Cirripede though in a functionless condition and into
them the outer membrane of the body and an important organ viz
the cementducts are still prolonged hence these prolongations must
be considered as aborted antenn Again we have seen that the mouth
of the young Cirripede is formed under the rudimentary mouth of the
pupa with the new sophagus round the old sophagus leading into
the same alimentary canal The twentyfour extreme tips likewise
of the six pairs of biramous cirri of the Cirripede are formed
within the twentyfour extremities of the six pairs of biramous
natatory legs of the pupa Consequently in the Cirripede and pupa
thus far part corresponds with part notwithstanding that new eyes
are formed posteriorly to the old eyes and new acoustic organs in a
quite different position from the old ones but now we come to a most
important diversity in the metamorphosis or rather to follow Professor
Owen in the metagenesis of the young Cirripede Although as
just stated the extremities of the cirri are formed within the legs
of the pupa yet from the great length of the cirri they occupy more
than the whole of the thorax of the pupa so that the thorax of the
young Cirripede is not formed within the preexisting thorax of the
pupa but within that part of the pupa homologically a portion of the
first three cephalic segments which lies anteriorly to the thorax
As a consequence of this the pedicels and lower portions of the
cirri the segments of the thorax and its dorsal surface all come to
occupy a position at nearly right angles to that of the corresponding
parts in the pupa this is shown in Pl  fig  And as a further
consequence and this is the more important point the sack which
both in the young Cirripede and pupa is formed by the overhanging and
produced portion of the carapace and which is internally lined by a
reduplication of the membrane of the thorax is necessarily owing to
the changed position of the thorax altered in extent and carried much
further namely from extending merely parallel to the longitudinal
axis of the pupa from b to b it is now in the young Cirripede
in addition carried to s almost quite across the inside of the
animal Hence it comes that the young Cirripede is as I have said in
my former volume internally almost intersected and its body remains
attached only by a small space see the broken line round a and b
in Pl  fig  of a Balanus with the shell c removed from one
side to the sternal or ventral inner surface of the carapacethe
carapace being modified either into the capitulum and peduncle or into
the shell with its operculum and basis As a still further consequence
of this change of position of the body of the young Cirripede within
the body of the pupa the alimentary canal becomes shortened to fully
half its former length At the same time the interspace between the
mouth and first pair of legs of the pupa consisting of the seventh
and eighth segments of the archetype is quite lost in the Cirripede
by coalescence The final cause of the thorax of the young Cirripede
not being developed within the thorax of the pupa probably is that
the cirri may be formed of considerable length so as to be immediately
enabled to seize prey and that the thorax which supports the cirri
and this probably is even more important should be as free as
possible within the sack so as to aid the captorial action of the
cirri

     Parthenogenesis pp  and 

After these remarks more especially with regard to the formation
of the sack if any one will look at the sectional drawing of a
pedunculated Cirripede in my former volume or of a sessile Cirripede
Pl  fig  in this present volume in which latter the shell adds
to the complexity he will perceive the cause of the extreme difficulty
in understanding the relative position of the parts throughout the
whole class Even after I had discovered that the prehensile antenn
of the pupa might always be found in the centre of the basis or
surface of attachment and which fact it might have been thought
should have convinced me that this was the anterior end of the whole
animal yet still I fancied that the prominent mouth represented the
entire head and that the shell was something quite distinct It is
clear that others have been equally perplexed for that which is the
anterior end in the eyes of one naturalist is the posterior end in
the eyes of another so with the dorsal and ventral surfaces one
naturalist considers the peduncle of the Lepas as the abdomen another
considers it as a pair of metamorphosed thoracic limbs c The
probable position of the segments of the body of a mature Cirripede
in relation to the three anterior cephalic segments or carapace is
shown in the diagram Pl  fig  of the supposed position of the
mature Proteolepas within its pupal envelopes Here in the diagram
the two segments immediately succeeding the mouth c which are the
seventh and eighth of the archetype for the mouth consists of three
segments and all in front of the mouth of three other segments
have come to adhere by their dorsal surfaces to the internal surface
of the carapacethat is of the first three segments which ought
of course to have stood quite in advance of these two segments and
these two segments again ought to have stood in advance of the mouth
The mouth is directed posteriorly instead of from the body and the
three segments of which it is formed closed at their anterior end by
the labrum and are very small compared to the relatively monstrously
great three anterior cephalic segments composing the carapace To
place the segments of the body of Proteolepas in proper sequence in
respect to those of the carapace and in accordance with the sequence
of the archetype Crustacean it would be necessary by seizing the
extremity of the abdomen a to tear the two segments succeeding
the mouth from their dorsal attachment as far back as the basal
margin of the labrum and then pull them till they stood posteriorly
to or in the diagram above the mouth which latter part would
by the same movement be made to project out at right angles to the
ventral surface and would then be preceded only by the first three
great confluent segments of the head which being produced backwards
form the carapace All that has just been said on the position in
Proteolepas of the segments of the body in relation to those forming
the carapace I believe to be applicable to all ordinary Cirripedes
with this difference that in the latter after the metamorphosis
the two segments succeeding the mouth quite disappear on the ventral
surface and dorsally are either aborted or have coalesced with the
adjoining segments

Act of Metamorphosis

When the due time for the act of metamorphosis has arrived the pupal
carapace splits along the dorsal ridge and is cast off together with
the acoustic sacks the basal segments of the two antenn and the
great black compound eyes hanging to the UUlike apodemes The three
terminal segments of the antenn invariably remain cemented to the
surface of attachment The exuvi usually continue for a time united to
the cemented antenn but are finally washed away Besides the split
along the dorsal ridge the carapace separates all round the orifice
from the delicate tunic lining the sack and investing the thorax and
natatory legs of the pupa for these membranes are not moulted for some
considerable time afterwards Hence all these inner parts retain for a
period the appearance and structure of the natatory pupa whilst the
exterior resembles in every respect a fixed and perfect Cirripede

In my former volume I have insisted on the important and curious
results which ensue from the eyeapodemes penetrating so deeply into
the body see Pl  fig  in which the proportions are more correct
than in fig  with the eyes attached exteriorly to their outer
arms for as these apodemes have to be ejected the external membrane
of the young Cirripede Pl  fig  has to be formed in a deep
fold or arch over them and consequently the membrane on the sternal
surface is formed considerably longer than on the dorsal surface From
this it follows when all the membranes are free and are stretched
fully out after the moult that the whole animal posteriorly to the
cementeddown surface turns vertically up and assumes its normal
position at right angles to the surface of attachment and to that
which it held in its pupal condition for the pupa always adheres with
its sternal surface parallel to the surface of attachment A young
Lepas which has just moulted its pupal carapace and has assumed its
proper vertical position with the cemented antenn and the surface of
attachment remaining as before is shown at fig  but is drawn on a
smaller scale than the pupa fig  out of which it may be supposed
to have been excluded In this fig  it may be observed that the
natatory legs and caudal appendages of the pupa have not as yet been
moulted The fact of the stretching out in the young Cirripede of the
fold of membrane which in pupa just before the metamorphosis passes
over the apodemes and eyes is well shown by three darklycoloured
bands in the corium which in the pupa are curled but after the moult
are stretched straight out on the peduncle of the young Lepas

The pupa and consequently the young Cirripede from being attached
at first by the antenn does not adhere by the actual anterior
extremity but by the sternal surface near it the anterior extremity
however soon becomes cemented down and afterwards in ordinary
cases ceases to grow In Cryptophialus however and in certain
genera of the Lepadid as Alcippe Lithotrya and Anelasma the
anterior or basal extremity does continue to grow and is not cemented
down and therefore comes to be prolonged beyond the original point
of attachment in order to allow of this the surface to which the
Cirripede is attached has to yield apparently simply to the pressure
exerted in the case of Anelasma but in the three other genera to
the rasping action of the roughened surface of the extremity of the
peduncle

When after a period the pupal membranes of the sack thorax and
natatory legs are moulted the cirri of the young Cirripede are
curled up and its thorax is raised towards the orifice and we have
the animal in its ordinary position and perfect with the exception
of a few parts to be further developed or modified For instead of
calcareous valves we have at this period only the socalled primordial
valves composed of chitine and in the case of Lepas australis
some minute spines and some coloured marks on the peduncle which soon
disappear The muscles which enter the three terminal segments of the
antenn in the pupa have to be absorbed and converted into ligamentous
threads In Lepas the labrum has to become bullate and the cca have
to increase in number round the upper end of the stomach and their
dark colour and that of the whole alimentary canal has to disappear or
be much weakened The filamentary appendages at the bases of the cirri
which generally contain some of the testes have to be developed
The probosciformed penis which at first equals only the pedicels of
the posterior cirri in length and is apparently imperforate has to
increase greatly in length The testes and vesicul seminales have to
be formed And lastly and this is a more important point the two
gutformed cementglands or incipient ovaria t fig  Pl 
which at the period of the moulting of the carapace and eyeapodemes
and when the whole animal was upturned came to occupy together
with the cementducts t their normal position i e nearly
parallel to the sternal surface now undergo further changes Their
upper and posterior ends lying near the cca of the stomach increase
in size but retain nearly the same character and thus form the two
true ovaria their middle parts become emptied of their cellular
contents and are converted into the two simple ovarian tubes and
their lower ends branch out inosculate and form the inextricable mass
of ovarian tubes and cca The points of junction on each side between
the two cementducts and the newly branched ovarian tubes become now
developed into the two cementglands The cementducts which continue
throughout life growing either still enter the old antenn and there
pour out the cementtissue or they pour it out through special
orifices formed for this purpose in the lower part of the peduncle The
changes supervening during the metamorphosis in the ovaria and in
the cementing apparatus here described I have no doubt are general
throughout the Order

I have above alluded to the primordial valves these are beautiful
objects when viewed under a high power they are composed of chitine
without a trace of calcareous matter but prefigure in shape size
and direction of growth the shelly valves soon to be formed under
and round them They are composed of an outer membrane with its
margins separated by yellow thickened rims from the membrane uniting
the several primordial valves together and this outer membrane is
underlaid by a single layer of generally hexagonal thickish cells Pl
 fig  a varying from  to th of an inch in diameter
These cells seem to contain a nucleus and they are at first separated
from each other by clear interspaces If a specimen be taken only
a little before the formation of the calcareous valves one or more
layers of membrane marked by an hexagonal reticulation can be
separated from the lower surface of the main hexagonal network It
is a singular fact that in those genera in which there are several
valves the primordial valves occur only on five namely on the two
scuta two terga and the carina and these are the most persistent
valves in the several genera The other valves are prefigured only by
brownish membrane without the hexagonal tissue In the mature Lepas
the membrane connecting the several shelly valves is not moulted but
disintegrates in the primordial valves however which stand far
separate from each other this membrane is moulted and immediately
after the first moult the first layer of shell appears under and
a little way beyond each primordial valve shelly matter likewise
appears at least in some cases between the cells of the hexagonal
tissue The young shelly valves are connected together at each
successive moult by narrower strips of membrane till in the case of
Lepas the valves when mature come to touch each other Lepadid Pl
 fig  The primordial valves are often preserved for a long time
on the umbones or centres of growth of the five valves on which they
occur in the same manner as the larvashell is sometimes preserved on
the apex of certain spiral molluscs Had not Cirripedes gone through
so many and such complicated metamorphoses this last state when
furnished only with primordial valves and with several internal organs
only partially or not at all developed would have deserved to have
ranked as a special stage and not as merely subordinate to the last or
pupal condition

In the Balanid or sessile Cirripedes the young animal immediately
after the metamorphosis or still better if dissected out of the
pupal carapace as I succeeded in doing with Balanus balanoides
may be said to be pedunculated for it is attached by a little disc
of cement closely surrounding the antenn the rest of the membranous
basis forming an almost semiglobular flexible peduncle The valves
at this the earliest period are all membranous and do not overlap
each other In the Balanin they do not present the peculiar structure
of the primordial valves of the Lepadid but in the Chthamalin in
Chthamalus I saw traces of this structure Calcareous valves are
soon formed under the membranous valves The opercular valves at
this early period are much larger than the valves or compartments
of the shell which are only four in number for the carinolateral
compartments are not yet formed The compartments from the first are
surprisingly strong and have their al already formed and overlapped
by the adjoining compartments but of the radii there is as yet no
trace The four compartments form a narrow but nearly circular hoop
which from its relatively large diameter tends to draw down the
upper or posterior end of the animal now forming the opercular valves
and as the basis soon becomes throughout cemented to the surface of
attachment the young Cirripede is much depressed Soon the opercular
valves are drawn a little way down within the shell becoming attached
to the sheath instead of as at first to the very summits of the
compartments In regard to the changes which take place in the shell
in the number of the segments in the cirri and in the number of spines
borne on these segments c during the continued growth of the
animal as they are chiefly important for the identification of the
species I will here refer to a discussion on this subject under the
head of the Genus Balanus


On the Homologies of the Carapace and Shelly Valves

In the pupa the carapace is produced not only posteriorly but
anteriorly so as to cover the entire animal with the exception of a
narrow sternal surface Pl  fig  in front it is notched where
the sternal surface terminates and from this notch a faint line runs
along the dorsal surface separating its tergal elements In the young
Cirripede after the metamorphosis there is no trace of this medial
dorsal suture or of the wider sternal surface Looking at the several
genera of the Lepadid the external covering of the whole peduncle and
capitulum is so continuous and of so uniform a nature that I think we
must consider the whole as a carapace of which the sternal borders
have become completely confluent formerly I was inclined to look at
the capitulum alone as formed by the carapace and at the peduncle as
being composed of the two or three anterior cephalic segments cased
only by their own integuments As far as can be discerned the carapace
in the pupa and consequently in the Cirripede consists only of the
tergal elements of the segments and this seems likewise to be the
case with the carapace of the Podophthalmia Until lately Prof
Milne Edwards doubted whether the carapace in the higher Crustaceans
to which I believe the carapace of Cirripedes must be compared was
formed by the backward production of the third segment which bears
the second pair of antenn or of the fourth i e the mandibular
segment but from the distribution of the nerves he now argues that
it must mainly belong to the third segment In Cirripedes the course
of the nerves leads to the same conclusion for the whole shell sack
and peduncle are supplied with nerves proceeding from the compounded
ganglion which belongs to the second and third cephalic segments

     Compare Histoire Naturelle des Crustacs tom i p 
    with Annales des Sciences Nat d series tom xvi  p 

     This conclusion is supported by the structure of Proteolepas
    in this Cirripede there is not a vestige of a carapace and as
    the whole of the animal in front of the mouth is almost utterly
    aborted being reduced to a mere covering to the two cementducts
    and as on the other hand the mouth with the mandibles though
    peculiarly modified is not at all aborted there is a strong
    probability that the abortion of the carapace is connected with
    the aborted state of the three anterior cephalic segments and that
    the carapace in its origin is not any way related to the fourth or
    mandibular segment

The whole of the head in front of the mouth together with the
carapace is as we know formed of three segments and each of these
segments homologically ought to consist of eight elements I recall
to mind these facts inasmuch as the transverse separation between the
peduncle and capitulum in the Lepadid and between the basis the
shell and the opercular valves in the Balanid might be thought to be
connected with the separation of the three cephalic segments So again
as in the Balanid the shell normally consists of eight compartments
these might be thought to be related to the eight elements of one or
other of the three segments But I see no reason for admitting this
view and in the case of the carina and rostrum two of the most
persistent and important of the compartments they exactly cover the
sutures which ought to separate the two tergal and two sternal elements
of the segment The valves moreover often form many more whorls
than three or the number of the true cephalic segments in front of
the mouth and in each whorl the valves tend to stand in tilelike or
alternate order with respect to those in the whorls both above and
below which would not be the case if they were the eight elements of
the segments

For the true homologies of the sclerodermic plates or Shelly valves
with which the external covering of Cirripedes is so generally
strengthened we must I believe look to the carapace of the
Podophthalmia In these latter we find the carapace composed of
sclerodermic plates which though closely joined and only occasionally
separated by sutures yet in their origin are distinct they
tend also to be arranged in alternate or tilelike order As the
animal grows the old sclerodermic plates all joined together are
moulted and new ones also all joined together of a larger size
are formed beneath Now let us imagine the growth to be more gradual
but yet periodical and the new and larger sclerodermic plates when
formed under the old ones to adhere firmly to them the older plates
would thus be prevented from becoming confluent and instead of
being all moulted together as is now the case they would be almost
continually separated from each other owing to the almost continuous
increase in size of the new underlying plates Consequently lines of
splitting would run between the several plates however numerous they
might be instead of there being as now a single line of splitting
extending down the back In fact we should have the identical manner
of growth of the shell or carapace which occurs in Cirripedes It is
on this ground and from the several points of homological resemblance
incidentally mentioned in the last few paragraphs that in the early
part of this Introduction p  when discussing the whole class I
stated that I believed that the carapace of Cirripedes presented more
real resemblance with the carapaces of the Podophthalmia or higher
Crustacea than with those of the lower Crustacea though in mere shape
they more nearly resembled the latter

Cementing Apparatus Plate 

I have already p  given an account of the manner in which in the
pupa of Lepas the cementtissue escapes from the prehensile antenn
and of the structure of the cementducts and of the cementglands
or incipient ovaria and likewise of the changes by which these
organs assume their ultimate form in the mature Cirripede In my
former volume on the Lepadid I described the cementglands and the
cementtissue in several genera and I have there shown singular as
the fact is that the two cementglands with their contents actually
consist of ovarian tubes with their contents for there seemed to be
a relation in the state of fulness in both in a modified condition
In the Balanid I am not able from the difficulty of the dissection
to confirm these conclusions excepting in so far that the tubes on
which the cementglands are formed run into the mass of ovarian cca
but I may add that in the abnormal Proteolepas belonging to another
Order see the section Pl  fig  nothing could be plainer than
that the membrane of the ovarian sack b formed the cementducts
and that their cellular contents which within the sack a were in
process of conversion into ova within the ducts were converted into
the cementtissue This cement by some unknown power travels down the
ducts and debouches at the antenn

In the Lepadid there are only two cementglands which are situated
high up in the midst of the ovarian cca with one cementduct
proceeding from each both the glands and ducts increase in size with
the age of the animal the cement issues either permanently from
the prehensile antenna or after a short period through apertures
in the peduncle arranged irregularly or in straight linesthe last
formed apertures being furthest from the central and basal point of
the peduncle In the Balanin on the other hand at each period of
growth a pair of new cementglands is developed larger than those
last formed and making with the older glands a chain connected
together by what I have called the cementtrunk The cementtrunk
consists of a tube which generally becomes enlarged just before
entering each gland The glands the cementtrunk and cementducts
all adhere to the basal membrane or basal shelly plate Each gland
gives rise to two cementducts these often bifurcate and sometimes
repeatedly bifurcate and inosculate before pouring out their contents
round the circumference of the basis and sometimes they all first
enter a circumferential cementduct The probable cause of the greater
complexity of the cementing apparatus and of the greater number of the
excretory orifices in the Balanid compared with the Lepadid is
that the entire surface of the broad basis which answers to the whole
peduncle in the Lepadid is firmly cemented down to the supporting
object instead of merely the basal end of the peduncle The cement
issues either in a cellular condition or more commonly as a fine
network which at a short distance from the orifices Pl  fig
 a z becomes so fine as to form a sheet or layer I may here
recall the fact that in the cement proceeding from the disc of the
antenn in some species of Lepas a similar structure was observed
The cement itself presents the same transparent brown laminated
structureless appearance and the same chemical reaction as described
in my former volume The cement has the capacity of occupying and
filling up all inequalities in the supporting surface I have seen it
when spread over an encrusting Flustra present an exact model of every
cell in the case of Coronula it seems as we shall immediately see
to have the power of penetrating into and even almost blending with
the epidermis of the supporting Cetacean The lastformed cementglands
and cementducts present a delicate and transparent appearance and
contain cellular matter whereas the old cementglands and sometimes
the old cementducts are filled with brownish cement not acted
on by boiling potash The foregoing remarks are confined to the
subfamily Balanin for I have not been able to examine thoroughly the
Chthamalin and can only affirm that in Chthamalus and Pachylasma the
cementducts repeatedly bifurcate and inosculate in the same manner as
in the Balanin I will now proceed to describe in some detail the
cementing apparatus in the several following genera

     I had some slight reason to suspect in Pollicipes that new
    cementglands were successively formed this is more probable in
    this genus than in the others inasmuch as it is the most nearly
    related to the Balanid

CoronulaThe cementing apparatus is here more simple than in any
other genus of the Balanin and I have studied it more carefully
The basal membrane of Coronula balnaris is figured in Pl  fig
 a and must first be described its relation to the shell will
hardly be understood without looking at the outline of the folded walls
of this species in Pl  fig  The basal membrane closes the
central circular hollow and is continuous with rays not represented
in Pl  extending under the doubled walls and terminal transverse
loops It has eighteen concave sides corresponding with the inner
ends of the folded walls for each of the six compartments is trebly
folded The membrane consists of successive conformable slips c
c bordered exteriorly by thickened yellowish rims and internally
overlapping when viewed from the inner side the few lastformed
slips and then thinning out The membrane forming each slip is itself
laminated The middle portion about th of an inch in diameter
is rather opaque owing to the slips being so close together Beyond
this central part the slips suddenly increase in size but yet have
a different shape from the sided outline which they ultimately
assume this difference is owing to the great changes in shape as
explained under the genus Coronula which the shell undergoes when the
walls at first assume their folded structure The walls are invested
by longitudinally striated membrane p p p fig  a which
turns in under their basal edges and this membrane is united with the
basal membrane by what I shall call the circumferential slip b
and which is shaded in fig  a simply for the sake of catching
the eye It is the circumferential slip of membrane which sends
rays under the spokelike folded walls thin as it is this slip is
yet laminated but is not bordered by thickened edges The membrane
investing the walls is like the basal membrane formed of successive
slips with thickened edges which overlapping viewed from the inside
the lastformed slips project beyond them and so face the edges of
the slips in the basal membrane they are only obscurely indicated in
fig  a The circumferential slip b lies over as viewed from
within both the basal and wall membrane This whole structure will
perhaps be best understood by the sectional diagram fig  b
in which the letters c c show the slips of basal membrane
p the parietal membrane coating the outside surface of the walls
of the shell not here represented b the circumferential slip
overlying both and z z the layers of cement which may for
the present be disregarded In order to allow of the growth of the
shell the circumferential slip b periodically splits in the
middle all round in a line exactly conformable to the edge of the
lastformed slip of basal membrane and likewise in straight medial
lines under the spokelike cut off in fig  a doubled walls I
have seen under a high power the line of splitting very shortly
after its formation with the two edges ragged and near together with
an extremely narrow new circumferential slip just formed between
and over the edges of the previously formed slip What causes the
circumferential slip to split so symmetrically I cannot say the
opposed edges after a time become thickened apparently from adhering
to the underlying layer of cement as will presently be described The
circumferential slip continues increasing in breadth till the period
of its splitting arrives by which time it has become much broader
than the lastformed slip of basal membrane and after the splitting
takes place the interior half towards the basal membrane forms a
new basal slip all round the basis and the exterior half adds a new
slip to the membrane investing the walls This latter membrane being
inflected under the basal edges of the walls is during the growth of
their edges drawn straight down the newlyformed portion taking the
inflected position

In the sectional diagram  b the circumferential slip is not yet
broad enough to split when it has become so it will split under
the letter b The slips of basal membrane are as may be seen in
fig  a narrower towards the circumference but the two or three
lastformed slips are out of proportion narrower than the others and
it is certain from the comparison of the basal membranes of specimens
of different ages that these will afterwards increase in width
I have seen no other instance in Cirripedes of growth in membranes
except at their extreme margins I suspect that these lastformed slips
are pulled during the downward and outward growth of the shell a
little from over the lastformed slips new and larger lamin being
all the time thrown down so as to prevent any fissure being formed I
also suspect that the gradual increase in width of the circumferential
slip itself is due to the opposed edges of the underlying and
lastformed circumferential slip being dragged further apart from each
other new and wider lamin of membrane being continually thrown down
the new circumferential slip being thus also all the time thickened
as well as rendered broader

     In the case of one young shell I found that the
    previouslyformed circumferential slip must have split long before
    it had assumed its proper and ordinary width for the lastformed
    slip of basal membrane was of extreme narrowness and would have
    to be considerably added to in width whilst the new and narrow
    circumferential slip was likewise being added to in width This
    slip of basal membrane though so extremely narrow had its own
    cementducts and glands

The central slip or rather disc of membrane is ths of an inch in
diameter and this shows the basal diameter of the shell immediately
after the metamorphosis In the middle of this little disc I saw
in several specimens the prehensile pupal antenn I made out
distinctly the ultimate segment with its bristles and as I believe
the discsegment which was ths of an inch in diameter but this
portion was much obscured by the quantity of cement When the corium
is removed from the inner side of the basal membrane the two chains
of glands extending from exactly over the antenn in the centre about
half way towards the circumference are conspicuous The cementtrunk
connecting the glands is thin and at the further end is always broken
off by the removal of the corium and overlying layer of ovarian cca
into which the two cementtrunks enter and without which removal
nothing could be seen The two chains of glands form a very large
angle open towards the rostral end of the shell as represented at
fig  c much enlarged by a mistake in fig  a the two have
been drawn in a straight line The cementtrunk increases in diameter
in proceeding from the centre to the circumference and the glands
likewise increase in size at the same time altering somewhat in shape
From near the lower side the basal membrane being viewed from within
of each gland two cementducts proceed which pour out their contents
beneath the basal membrane The orifices of the ducts always exactly
face the middle folds of the two lateral and two carinolateral
compartments In a fullsized specimen there are from thirtyfive to
forty cementglands on each side always corresponding exactly with
the number of slips of basal membrane including the circumferential
slip to which the lastformed pair of glands and cementducts belong
In correspondence with the great number and narrowness of the central
slips of membrane so are the cementglands towards the centre numerous
and very small All the glands in the more central parts consist of
a mere transverse enlargement of the cementtrunk but the exterior
and larger glands which are more closely packed together are more
globular or pearshaped and the two ducts of which the one on the
rostral side is considerably enlarged at its base do not come out of
the gland exactly at the same level The trunk connecting the glands
runs straight from one to the other The ducts proceeding from the
outer and older glands on the carinal side are much curved Pl 
fig  c To give an idea of the dimensions of the several parts I
may state that the largest ducts were ths of an inch in diameter
and the glands belonging to them nearly thrice as much measured in the
direction of the cementtrunk on the other hand some of the ducts
from the small central glands had a diameter eighteen times less than
that of the largest ducts Towards the circumference the ducts that
proceed from the older and larger glands are piled one exactly over the
otherthe last formed being the topmost and all are imbedded in the
corium which overlies the basal membrane this position of the ducts
one over the other which could not be well represented in figs  a
and  c is owing to their all debouching at the same exact point
But the ducts form the smaller and younger glands when the shell
had a different shape are spread out and are all attached to the
basal membrane Altogether the basal membrane of Coronula when well
cleaned and examined under a moderately high power presents the most
singular and elegant appearance

We now come to the cementtissue this lies on the under or outer
side of the basal membrane it is not represented in figs  a or
 c but only in the sectional diagram  b by the letters z
z it presents its usual character and appearance like solid glue
or brown gum but is obliquely laminated and sublaminated it forms
a layer much thicker than the basal membrane itself being as much
as  or  of an inch in thickness It is however difficult
to ascertain its thickness from the singular manner in which it
penetrates into and almost blends with the epidermis of the whales
skin so much so that for a considerable time I thought not then
knowing anything about the cement of Cirripedes that this transparent
horny substance probably answered to a corn on the human foot produced
by pressure But I soon observed that this horny substance certainly
extended into and up the cementducts and this fact first led me to
the examination of the whole subject in the several genera of Lepadid
and Balanid It was not difficult to remove the cementducts leaving
small portions of the contained cement projecting freely up as points
from the general surface of cement The cement adheres slightly to the
whole basal membrane but chiefly to the yellowish rims or edges of
the successive slips and it is indeed this adhesion which I believe
produces the rims for the circumferential slip when first split had
very thin ragged edges The cement also extends under the spokelike
prolongations of the circumferential slip and likewise some way up the
sides of the walls

The cementglands the trunk and the ducts except the two three
or even four lastformed ones are all filled with an apparently
solid thread of transparent brownish cement differing in no respect
from the cement under the central parts of the basal membrane In
one instance in which the lastformed pair of glands and ducts had
apparently been only just developed they were so perfectly transparent
that I could distinguish them only under certain lights and I could
not perceive any contents The lastformed glands and ducts always
appear very delicate and include a tube of very delicate tissue
containing more or less of granular matter The next succeeding pair of
glands and ducts are always more opaque and contain much more granular
matter which in the next or next but one may be seen passing into
the state of pale brown transparent chitine I have seen some most
distinct instances in which in the same duct the part towards the
centre of the basis was filled with homogeneous cement and the part
towards the circumference with still plainly granular matter In the
successive circular slips of cementtissue lying attached under the
circumferential slip and under the two or three succeeding slips of
basal membrane an exactly analogous series of changes is presented as
indeed might have been expected as the slips of cement are absolutely
continuous with the contents of the ducts Moreover if a vertical
section be made across one of the lastformed slips of cement it
may sometimes be seen to be apparently in the act of separating into
layers with the lower layers more pulpy elastic and white than the
upper layers which are less coherent and show as yet even still less
the character of cement The cement under the circumferential and
adjoining slips often presents a peculiar wrinkled appearance in
lines conformable with the outline of the basal membrane but I do not
believe that these are real wrinkles though so like them they seem
to consist of sinuous threads longer or shorter sometimes slightly
branched crossing and interjoined and composed apparently of faintly
coloured cement I suspect that these threads are formed by the union
and subsequent drawing out of aggregations of that matter which within
the ducts is first granular and then changes into cement for at the
orifices of the ducts these wrinkled threads sweep outwards in curved
lines on both sides The cement in these early stages adheres with
very little force to the basal membrane and with only a little more
force to the underlying layers of cement in fact till it assumes the
brown translucent appearance like solid glue it hardly seems to act
as cement

How the cement reaches the skin of the whale will be best understood
by referring to the sectional diagram Pl  fig  b When the
circumferential slip of membrane b splits a new circumferential
slip will be formed over it together with new cementglands and
ducts and cement z z will issue from four new orifices and
will extend on both sides of these orifices till the ends meet and
become united thus forming a narrow sided continuous new slip
of cement with  spokes proceeding from it I have not noticed lines
of union in the cement of any one slip but the matter forming each
slip certainly has proceeded from four distinct orifices Seeing how
perfectly successive layers of cement often become blended together
lines of union or junction could hardly be expected to be preserved
in the same individual layer When the circumferential slip of basal
membrane splits the underlying slip of cement which we will call A
does not split but becomes stretched so that the newly formed slip of
cement which we will call B does not reach the skin of the whale As
the new circumferential slip of basal membranes goes on increasing in
width A continues to be stretched but does not split till at least
another circumferential slip of basal membrane has been formed and
has been split and till B has been also stretched By this time the
cementtissue A has assumed its normal structure and has the power of
adhering to the whales skin which it has now reached owing to the
splitting of the under and older slips of cement At the next period
of growth A itself will split and B will touch the whales skin and
adhere to it and this also will ultimately split It results from
this action that the cement has a stretched and sometimes even a
fibrous appearance with the lower edges of the layers of which each
slip of cement is formed thinning out I have before stated that the
two or three lastformed slips of basal membrane are formed at first
too narrow and apparently have to be dragged outwards over each
other and it is perhaps owing to this circumstance and to globules of
cement having first adhered to the under surface of the slips of basal
membrane that these slips are studded beneath with parallel little
vermiform bodies sometimes of considerable length and furnished
with heads all directed outwards These tapering vermiform bodies
have a considerable resemblance to the threads before mentioned
which give the wrinkled concentric appearance to the newlyformed
layers of cement and have probably a closely analogous origin in
one case indeed it appeared as if some of these concentric threads
were in process of being drawn out at right angles to their original
course Lastly it should be observed that as the exterior half of the
membrane of the circumferential slip after each splitting is dragged
down and thus comes to invest the outer surface of the wall of the
shell the wall not being represented in the diagram but standing
where the letter p stands so it must be with the cement which
thus likewise comes in an unusual manner to invest the outer surface
of the folded walls of the shell and attaches them to the skin of the
whalewhich latter is always growing upwards and tending to bury the
shell

Platylepas decorataThis genus is closely allied to Coronula
and the cementing apparatus is essentially similar In one specimen
I counted no less than fortynine slips of basal membrane each of
which of course had its pair of cementglands and each of the
latter its two ducts The glands consists of a transverse enlargement
of the trunk as in the early stages of Coronula Neither the glands
nor the duct when old become filled up with cement but only the
maintrunk The ducts are very delicate and thin the larger ones being
only  of an inch in diameter The glands stand some way apart
on the two cement trunks and the latter instead of being straight
as in Coronula are deeply serpentine the glands are formed on each
bend so that though all on one side are connected on the same trunk
they form a double row on each side of the basal membrane The basal
membrane in the centre of which I distinctly saw the antenn of the
pupa has six deep bays or excisions corresponding with the midribs
see Pl   a  d of the six compartments and the two ducts
from each gland on the right and left sides debouch at the heads of
the four lateral excisions exactly opposite the midribs of the lateral
and carinolateral compartments The laterformed glands owing to
all of them being situated some way apart from each other on the two
cementtrunks lie further from the centre of the basis than do the
orifices of their ducts hence the laterformed ducts are directed a
little backwards or from near the circumference towards the heads of
the deep excisions

TubicinellaThe cementing apparatus is here less symmetrical but
this I believe is chiefly owing to the basal membrane being formed
of successively larger discs not slips of membrane thrown down not
quite concentrically one over the other each new disc of membrane
seems to cover the lastformed cementglands and ducts and there
are as many ducts and glands as there are discs of membrane all
adhering together In one specimen it appeared that normally there
were four sets of cementducts as in the allied genera of Coronula and
Platylepas but in other specimens the ducts were distributed very
irregularly In one case the two cementtrunks extended parallel and
close together one of them terminating long before the other I have
given a figure Pl  fig  of three of the cementglands removed
from the basal membrane together with their ducts The cementtrunk
f f seemed to be a little enlarged and to be crossed by septa as
it entered the glands h but I could not make out this structure
clearly enough to be represented Whilst young the cementglands stand
some little way apart from each other and in the figure given of some
of the lastformed glands they are hardly separate enough Each gland
gives out obliquely on one side a cementduct c which I traced
in several cases to the margin of one of the discs of basal membrane
where cement issued from it and on the opposite side a tapering spur
b varying in length which may be called and I believe really
is a rudimentary duct Of these spurs we shall meet many instances
in other genera The duct c and the spur b close to where
they entered the gland in some specimens gave off at about right
angles short blunt points or rudimentary branches This duct and spur
correspond I believe with the two ducts in Coronula but besides
these a duct a is given off from one end of the gland from the
surface opposite to that at which the cementtrunk enters This duct
a is very singular from always forming a loop a with two
spurs projecting from it these two spurs occasionally spring from a
common point I have seen nothing like this structure in any other
Cirripede This duct a runs like the duct c to the margin
of its own disc of basal membrane where it debouches Besides these
ducts in the best specimen which I examined there were two other
sets of ducts which were slightly zigzag and at each angular bend
a mere knob or point or at most a short branch was given off but
this branch seemed never to run to the margin of the basal membrane
or to give out cement whereas the main branch did give out cement I
was not able to trace these ducts to their glands In these zigzag
ducts and in the rudimentary points sometimes observed at the base
of the duct c and likewise at the base of the spur b we see
the first indication of that tendency to bifurcation so strongly
characteristic of the cementducts in all the genera excepting those
already described which are allied to Coronula

Chelonobia patulaThe cementing apparatus is here chiefly
remarkable for the thinness and straightness of the main trunk f f
Pl  fig  and from the great distance at which the glands stand
apart had another gland been drawn it would on the scale here used
have stood exactly under the two upper c c in fig  c We
here see that the trunk f before entering the gland h has an
enlarged portion g this I suspect is a very general structure
Each gland gives out on opposite sides two ducts a a b b
larger even than the main trunk and these ducts bifurcate repeatedly
and inosculate By this inosculation it is not improbable that all four
ducts proceeding from the two glands of the same age may be connected
together certainly the bifurcating branches from the same duct thus
become repeatedly connected For the first two or three bifurcations
the ducts decrease very little or not at all in diameter but nearer
the circumference they become smaller The ducts also proceeding
from the younger and smaller glands are of course proportionably
smaller In one case I was able to count four bifurcations in the duct
between the gland and the edge of the basal membrane It follows from
this structure that the basal membrane at each period of growth
is cemented down by cement issuing from several orifices but we
shall presently find that in other genera the cement proceeds from
many more orifices In fig  there is represented by the aid of the
camera a small portion from the outer a to the outer b being
ths of an inch in length of the basal membrane with all the
several cementducts adhering to it which I could distinguish and
drawn of their proper relative sizes this figure also shows some of
the bifurcations but no inosculation happened to be included in the
space here given the basal membrane itself has not been represented
In taking a view of a considerable portion of the basal membrane
especially towards the circumference some parallelism in the branches
could be perceived one set of branches tending to run in the direction
of the ray of the circle and the other set in the line of the
circumference

Elminius KingiiThe cementglands here resemble those of
Chelonobia but the trunk does not seem to be enlarged before
entering the gland The glands are situated rather far apart and
the chief peculiarity is that the trunk connecting the glands is
as tortuous as the track of a worm Each gland gives out two ducts
which bifurcate repeatedly and often inosculate making in parts
an hexagonal meshwork some of the branches do not debouch on the
basal membrane but terminate in blunt points So numerous are the
ducts that the basal membrane may be compared to pieces of paper
with the fine fibrous branching roots of some plant dried and heaped
on it Some of these ducts are very regularly jointed and resemble
a confervaan appearance which I believe is owing to divisions in
the contained cement other ducts are partially marked by little
wrinkles as presently to be described under Balanus The cement
instead of as heretofore invariably forming a slip round and beneath
the circumference of the basal membrane here often forms little
independent circular and irregularlyshaped discs each of which has
issued from a single orifice I may here add that in two species of
Tetraclita I saw the cementducts repeatedly bifurcating with some
of the branches inosculating as in Elminius and Chelonobia

In Balanus balanoides which like all the Cirripedes hitherto
mentioned has a membranous basis I could only make out an amazing
number of bifurcating and inosculating cementducts of very various
diameters The cementtissue on the under side of the basal membrane
generally consisted of little circular discs on an average from  to
ths of an inch in diameter but there were also globules and
short tortuous threads of cement In some very much elongated and
crowded specimensin which during the downward growth of the walls
the basal membrane had ceased to reach the surface of attachment and
being thus suspended had become as viewed from the outside deeply
concavethe cement had apparently continued to try to reach the rock
and now hung down in the form of two thickish roots some tenths of
an inch in length These roots were round and tapered either to a
fine or blunt point one was doubled on itself and so had become
united in the other I could perceive five layers or sheaths of the
cementtissue one within the other the innermost of these layers
which once no doubt formed the outside surface of the root was only
a quarter of its present length

In Balanus tintinnabulum the basis is calcareous when its upper
surface is cleaned dried and examined under a good light the
numerous larger cementducts can be seen even by the naked eye or
under a weak lens and present an elegant appearance These larger
ducts run in parallel lines from the two chains of glands towards the
circumference They are all encrusted with calcareous matter and in
the more central parts are hidden under it at each period of growth
when the basis is added to round the circumference it would appear
that a layer of excessive tenuity of shell is thrown down over the
whole surface just in the same way as in Tubicinella at each period
a new and larger disc of membrane was thrown down over the preexisting
membranes with their cementing apparatus The cementglands in the
middle of the basal plate seem often to give rise to small abnormal
depositions of calcareous matter When the basis it is best to take
a young specimen is slowly dissolved in acid all the cementing
apparatus is left uninjured adhering to the delicate tissue which
before existed in a calcified condition Near the middle I saw the two
antenn of the pupa and from them the two cementtrunks extended about
halfway towards the circumference These two chains of glands are
often placed very irregularly but they tend to form as in Coronula
a large angle open towards the rostral end of the shell The glands
close to the old antenn commence abruptly of rather large size the
laterformed glands with their ducts are in regular order larger than
the younger ones and stand much closer together After immersion in
acid all the glands and ducts appeared empty instead of the older
ones being as in Coronula filled with cement In one case I counted
on each trunk twentyfive glands besides some smaller obscure ones
close to the centre

In Pl  fig  b I have given a drawing of two of the cement
glands the cementtrunk f f is smooth and apparently cylindrical
it becomes enlarged at g before entering the gland it seems even
to be prolonged across the gland under the form of a narrow bar not
represented which apparently serves to keep the two ends of the
trunk on the two sides of the gland in their proper relative places
and distances The gland itself is an elongated bag h which
properly lies exactly over the enlarged portion g of the trunk
but in the drawing has been purposely displaced it gives rise in the
laterformed glands to a sort of neck see the upper gland which
is either so long as to deserve rather to be called a duct and which
soon bifurcates or is quite short see the lower gland and gives rise
to two separate ducts On the opposite side of these glands there
is a spur m of greater or shorter length which is evidently a
rudimentary duct for in the younger glands it existed as a perfect
duct Moreover the firstmentioned duct often gives off branches
t having an exactly similar appearance with the spur m The
membrane of which the cementtrunk f with the enlargements g
is composed is smooth but that of the glands and of all the ducts
presents a very peculiar appearance which at first would be called
scaled but more properly perhaps notchedeach notch being apparently
formed by a line of thickened membrane extending obliquely round only
a short portion of the tube and indenting it The ducts which I
measured were between th and ths of an inch in diameter

In fig  a I have given a drawing of the two chains of glands but
with only those ducts figured which proceeded from the lastformed
pair of glands The specimen here drawn was old and it is rare to
find the structure of the ducts so simple From both glands a neck
or thick duct arises which soon bifurcates one branch runs direct
into the circumferential duct and the other t bifurcates again
of the latter one branch unites with its fellow from the opposite
gland and then forming a single duct t enters as do the two
other branches the circumferential duct Thus into the latter five
main ducts enter the position of their points of entrance with
respect to the shell varies considerably but I think the five points
tend to face the middle of the rostrum and middle of the two lateral
compartments on each side In some other specimens in which the
ducts were nearly as simple I observed that the neck or main duct at
once divided into three branches instead of into two with one soon
bifurcating and on one side a rudimentary branch or spur was given off
above t indicating a tendency to an additional bifurcation In
the laterformed glands the ducts proceed only from the outer sides
and form the ends of the glands furthest from the centre but in the
earlierformed and smaller glands of the same individual other ducts
proceed from the inner sides where in the older glands the spurs m
are situated moreover in the younger glands all the ducts bifurcate
much oftener how often I was not able to ascertain before entering
the circumferential duct many of the branches however terminating in
spurlike points Now if we imagine twenty or thirty repetitions of the
ducts given in fig  a independently of the greater complication
of the ducts of the younger glands each a very little smaller than
the other and placed with the main branches parallel one over and
within the other we shall gain some insight into the wonderfully
complicated structure of the cementing apparatus in this and many other
species of Balanus

     It should be observed that fig  b ought to have been drawn
    with its present upper end downwards to make it correspond in
    position with fig  a

I have as yet only alluded to the circumferential duct i i Pl
 fig  a we have not hitherto met with this duct but I suspect
that the branches which in Chelonobia inosculate and which seem to
run nearly parallel to the circumference of the basal membrane answer
the same purpose of connecting the ducts together and are perhaps
strictly homologous In this and some other species of Balanus the
lastformed circumferential duct runs round the margin of the upper
lamina of the basal plate close to the basal edges of the walls and
as these latter have projecting longitudinal ribs the duct curves
a little round each rib so that the whole duct is formed by as many
short inwardly curved portions as the walls have ribs or longitudinal
septa Between the basal extremities of these parietal longitudinal
septa the extremities of the radiating septa of the basis project
and enter and along the crests of the latter little branchducts
i proceeding from the circumferential duct extend In the basis
beneath the tubes formed by the justmentioned radiating septa there
is a cancellated shelly mass which in fig  a was of unusual
thickness and along the crests of the branching ridges forming this
cancellated mass the subbranches of the above branchducts i
run these soon become so minute as not to be distinguished by the
highest powers and thus form a sheet of cement which attaches the
lastformed zone of the shelly basis to the supporting surface At
what point the membrane forming any one duct ceases the cementtissue
being alone left I was not able to ascertain but the lower parts
of the reticulated slip z z fig  a closely resembled the
cementtissue which surrounds the discsegment of the pupal antenn
in Lepas australis The circumferential duct here and there forms
little loops as may be seen in fig  a and often two branches
running along the crests of two adjoining basal septa proceed from
a common point of the circumferential duct The cement itself under
different parts of the basis appears as little separate discs as
threads globules and as a fine network but most commonly as simple
layers As each thick zone of shelly matter is added round the basis
the exterior branches of the ducts between the circumferential duct
and the new layer of cement beneath are fairly imbedded in shell and
are for ever hidden without indeed acid be used for the dissolution
of the calcareous matter so also the preexisting ducts and glands
and the main trunk would all have been hidden if the layer of
calcareous matter which I believe is thrown down at each period of
growth over the entire surface had not been of excessive tenuity

I cursorily examined the cementing apparatus in Balanus galeatus
improvisus and crenatus which have all calcareous bases and
belong to different sections of the genus and the structure seemed to
be essentially the same In Bal galeatus I found the cementducts
varying in diameter from th to th of an inch in diameter
In B improvisus the cementglands do not differ much from those
of B tintinnabulum but the cementducts bifurcate often before
entering the circumferential duct and the little branches which
proceed from the latter are very short and almost immediately owing
to the thinness of the basis blend into a slip of cement

                                   

I hope to be excused for describing at such length the apparatus by
which sessile cirripedes are permanently attached to a supporting
surface for this is the great leading character of the subclass
not hitherto observed in any other Crustacean It is not easy to
overstate the singularity and complexity of the appearance of the
basal membrane of a Balanus or Coronula and when we consider the
homological nature of the apparatus the subject becomes still more
curious I feel an entire conviction from what I have repeatedly
seen in several genera of the Lepadid both in their mature and
pupal condition and from what I have seen in Proteolepas that the
cementglands and ducts are continuous with and actually a part of an
ovarian tube in a modified condition and that the cellular matter
which in one part goes to the formation of ova or new beings in the
other and modified part goes to the formation of the cementing tissue
To conclude with an hypothesisthose naturalists who believe that
all gaps in the chain of nature would be filled up if the structure
of every extinct and existing creature were known will readily admit
that Cirripedes were once separated by scarcely sensible intervals
from some other now unknown Crustaceans Should these intervening
forms ever be discovered I imagine they would prove to be Crustaceans
of not very low rank with their oviducts opening at or near their
second pair of antenn and that their ova escaped at a period of
exuviation invested with an adhesive substance or tissue which served
to cement them together probably with the exuvi of the parent
to a supporting surface In Cirripedes we may suppose the cementing
apparatus to have been retained the parent herself instead of the
exuvi being cemented down whereas the ova have come to escape by a
new and anomalous course

     Rathke has described Acta Nova  p  in some
    siphonostomatous crustaceans a pair of curious organs which serve
    to secrete a substance that holds the eggs attached together in a
    mass to the parents body these organs Rathke has designated by
    a similar name to that which I have used namely the cementing
    organs or receptacles they are distinct from the oviducts but
    enter them near their external orifices As in Cirripedes the
    cementglands and ducts are certainly continuous with an ovarian
    tube and as they occupy a quite different position in the animals
    body these organs of Rathke though in some degree analogous in
    function must be homologically distinct


Affinities Classification Variation

Under the Order it has been stated that the Balanid are on the
cirripedial type the highest in the class that is they are the
most complicated but not to use Professor Owens term by mere
vegetative repetition Amongst the Balanid the first section of the
genus Balanus may be taken as typical here we have the structure of
the shell extremely complicated yet beautifully adapted for strength
and for the protection of the included body The cementing apparatus
is here also most complicated I have divided the Balanid into two
natural subfamilies the Balanin and Chthamalin in accordance
with certain differences in the structure of the shell and of the
animals body that this division is natural might almost be inferred
from the one fact that all the characters by which the Chthamalin
differ from the Balanin are those by which the former approaches
the family of the Lepadid moreover certain anomalous characters
in the Chthamalin as the supplemental whorls of compartments in
Catophragmus and the presence of caudal appendages in this same genus
and in Pachylasma reveal this same affinity The only objection which
I can see to the separation of the sixteen genera into the above
two subfamilies may be drawn from the degree to which they blend
together thus as far as the shell is concerned Chelonobia in one
important internal point of structure tends to assume the character
of the Chthamalin and on the other hand Pachylasma a member of the
Chthamalin has a shell which if not examined during its earliest
growth would be placed without doubt amongst the Balanin But it
fortunately so happens that in no one character of the body does
Pachylasma approach the Balanin more nearly than do the other members
of its subfamily or Chelonobia approach in the same respects the
Chthamalin It is only in Chthamalus of which the shell clearly
places it in the subfamily bearing its name that in some of the
species the less bullate labrumthe larger palpithe lower teeth
of the mandibles being laterally doubleand the lower segments of
the third pair of cirri being thickly clothed like the lower segments
of the second pair with bristlesall show that these species make an
approach in structure to the Balanin

It will be seen that I have divided the Balanin into two little
groups according as whether the branchi consist of one or of two
plicated folds of membrane and as whether or not the scutum and
tergum are articulated together I have been greatly tempted to
follow Drs Leach and Gray who have separated the second of these
groups containing the genera Coronula Tubicinella Xenobalanus
and Platylepas into the subfamily of the Coronulin Certainly
these genera have a peculiar aspect in common and agree in being
parasitic and imbedded in the skin of Cetaceans as is the case
with the first three genera or in that of turtles manatee and
seasnakes as in Platylepas Though these genera possess several
peculiar characters yet I can find none common to all four excepting
their imbedment in the skin of Vertebrata their double branchi and
their nonarticulated opercular valves and these I do not think of
sufficient importance to serve for the separation of a subfamily for
in Chthamalus one species has double branchi one species has no
branchi at all and the other species have single branchi so again
in Chelonobia the scutum having only a horny articular ridge makes
an approach to Coronula and its allies I may further specify that the
folded walls a singular character common to Coronula Platylepas and
Xenobalanus fails in Tubicinella the open tubes and the imperfect
outer lamina of the parietes towards their bases are characters which
fail in one species of Platylepas the muscles running to the opercular
valves being thinly spread out and partially without transverse stri
is also a character which fails in Platylepas the simplicity of the
cementducts partially fails in Tubicinella and lastly the existence
of small intermediate teeth on the mandibles fails in Xenobalanus
hence I repeat I have not thought it prudent to admit the subfamily
of the Coronulin though in many respects a very natural group

The genera in the Balanin and Chthamalin are founded chiefly on
the number of the compartments the number being apparently due as
previously explained to the fusion or abortion of certain of the
eight typical compartments and secondarily on the nature and even
form of the basis and on the porosity of the walls In Coronula and
its allies the nonarticulated opercular valves and deeply folded
walls come into play As a justification for using these characters in
distinguishing the genera and even to a certain extent in separating
the two subfamilies I must call to mind that the shell with the
basis is not merely a dermal envelope as amongst Molluscs but
actually consists of the first three segments of the head The parts of
the mouth and the cirri are of very little service in distinguishing
the generaa singular fact considering that most of the genera
amongst the Lepadid could be distinguished by these organsthough
trifling details in their structure sometimes come in useful as
specific characters Balanus with the subgenus Acasta Pyrgoma with
the subgenus Creusia Tetraclita and Elminius are genera of about
equal value though perhaps the two latter are rather more nearly
related together than to the others Chelonobia is more distinct it
shows some little affinity to the Chthamalin and likewise to the four
following genera Coronula Platylepas Tubicinella and Xenobalanus
are genera quite distinct from the foregoing and from each other
yet as we have just seen palpably allied together Amongst the
Chthamalin Pachylasma Octomeris and Catophragmus are more closely
related to each other than to the other two genera of the subfamily
yet Pachylasma as far as the shell is concerned leads into the
Balanin and Catophragmus into the Lepadid Octomeris leads towards
Chthamalus and Chthamalus towards Chamsipho

VariationThe discrimination of the species in most of the
genera offers very great difficulties I cannot too strongly impress
on any one intending to study this class not to trust to external
characters he must separate and clean and carefully examine the
internal structure and form of the compartments and more especially
of the opercular valves After considerable experience when numerous
varieties of a species have been carefully examined the eye acquires a
sort of instinctive knowledge by which it can recognise the species
though the character cannot be defined by language but I have found
that no amount of experience with some of the commonest species
will save frequent and grave errors as long as external characters
alone are trusted to Not only does every external character vary
greatly in most of the species but the internal parts very often
vary to a surprising degree and to add to the difficulty groups of
specimens not rarely vary in the same manner After having given up
several years to the study of this class I must express my deliberate
conviction that it is hopeless to find in any species which has a
wide range and of which numerous specimens from different districts
are presented for examination any one part or organwhich from
differing in the different species is fitted for offering specific
charactersabsolutely invariable in form or structure I may in one
respect even go further and affirm that if in a species any part or
organ differs remarkably from the same part in its congeners then if
many specimens are examined especially when collected from different
districts such part or organ will be found eminently variable I
may instance the antenniformed third pair of cirri in Chthamalus
antennatus the teeth on the posterior cirri in Acasta sulcata
the terga in Pyrgoma dentatum the adductor ridge of the scuta in
Pyrgoma cancellatum and in Creusia and other such cases hence it
will not do to found a species on a slight or sometimes even on a
considerable difference in any single point or organ On the other
hand I am far from asserting that if only halfadozen specimens of
some rare species of Cirripede be brought from some one quarter of the
world characters beautifully defined may not be readily discovered In
determining what forms to call varieties I have followed one common
rule namely the discovery of such closelyallied intermediate forms
that the application of a specific name to any one step in the series
was obviously impossible or when such intermediate forms have not
actually been found the knowledge that the differences of structure in
question were such as in several allied forms certainly arose from
variationfor instance in the case of two shells otherwise identical
one being longitudinally ribbed and the other smooth a character which
we know to varybut I have always used this argument from analogy with
great caution Finally as in the large genus Balanus there is an
especial amount of variation I have there entered in detail on this
subject and I hope that those interested in it will refer to that
discussion which is almost verbally applicable to some other genera of
the family as Tetraclita and Chthamalus


Rate of Growth Exuviation Powers of Repairing Injuries

In my former volume I have shown that the pedunculated cirripedes
grow rapidly this is likewise the case with the Balanid Mr
Stutchbury informs me that he has seen numerous specimens of Balanus
tintinnabulum from  to  inches in height and from  to  inches
in circumference and this is nearly the full size which the species
attains on a vessel which had been to sea only during one year At
Coquimbo in Chile I have seen a specimen of B psittacus  of
an inch in basal diameter and  in height adhering to a chain that
had been only six months under water Poli also gives the case of
some Balani probably B perforatus which in about four months
had attained a basal diameter of  inch and a height of th of an
inch Balanus balanoides is a smaller species and of slower growth
for the late Mr W Thompson of Belfast found that in three months
from July d certain marked specimens had increased from 
lines to  lines which is the usual maximum size attained in that
locality From other observations Mr Thompson believes that the
extreme duration of life of this species is about two years whether
the other and apparently quickergrowing species are shorterlived I
have no means of judging

In accordance with this rapid growth is the frequency of the periods
of exuviation Mr Thompson kept twenty specimens of B balanoides
alive and on the twelfth day he found the twentyfirst castoff
integument showing that all had moulted once and one individual
twice within this period This frequency of exuviation together
with the durability of the castoff integuments explains the
astonishing masses of exuvi which Mr Peach assures me he annually
has observed off the coast of Cornwall they are most abundant in
April and May but he has seen quantities also in September he could
easily as he tells me have filled several quartmeasures with them
The specimens sent to me consisted chiefly of Balanus balanoides
perforatus and Chthamalus stellatus The opercular membrane
with a narrow strip from between the two scuta and another narrow
strip from between the two terga are moulted together in connection
with the more delicate membrane lining the sack and investing the
plicated branchi This membrane likewise is continuously connected
with that covering the whole body and its appendages As I have stated
under the Lepadid the inner tunic of the sophagus of the rectum
of the olfactory pouches and that which enters a little way into the
acoustic meatus and the apodemes of the maxill are all moulted
On the cirri and jaws new spines are formed with their upper ends
enclosed within the old spines but with their lower ends projecting
inwards beyond the bases of the old spines and inverted like the
fingers of a glove hastily pulled off The membranes of the body in
the act of exuviation split I believe only over the prosoma How the
neat separation of the opercular membrane from all round the sheath
and opercular valves is effected I do not fully understand but it
is probably analogous to the splitting of the thick carapace of the
common crab I suspect in Coronula in which genus and its allies the
opercular membrane is not periodically moulted that the membrane
lining the sack is not always thrown off at the same exact time with
that of the body In Chthamalus stellatus in the act of moulting
the opercular membrane is the last part that separates from the new
underlying membranes I find that this species can moult when kept in a
damp box out of water The new membranes of the body immediately after
the exuviation are not lax in any extreme degree The exuvi of the
genus Chthamalus and of some other genera amongst the Chthamalin can
at once be recognised by the divergence of the posterior four pairs
of cirri in the case of Chthamalus stellatus I have also noticed
that the animal generally dies with these cirri in the same divergent
position Finally I cannot doubt that the Triton described by
Linnus was only the exuvi of some Balanus probably B porcatus
Linnus mistaking the probosciformed penis for the mouth of his
imagined distinct animal

     In Daphnia Straus Mm du Museum tom vi p  found
    that the individuals moulted every five or six days

     Linnus speaks of the included body inhabitant as he calls
    it of other Cirripedes as a Triton and this I think shows
    that Lessons conjecture that the Triton was an Alepas cannot be
    correct for Linnus could hardly have supposed that a pedunculated
    cirripede inhabited another pedunculated or sessile cirripede

I have seen a few specimens showing that when the shell has been broken
it can be repaired and this I believe is effected by the growth
of a crest of corium between the broken edges and the subsequent
calcification of this crest Mr Stutchbury possesses a monstrous
specimen of Chelonobia testudinaria in which one of the lateral
compartments on one side has not been developed The cirri not rarely
get cut off but are as it appears soon repaired I have observed
a singular number of examples of the act of reparation in a group of
the Australian Balanus vestitus The manner in which the cirri are
repaired seems to me curious the cutoff end is closed by a rounded
scale of yellowish chitine and then the corium in the four or five
subjacent segments separates from the external articulated membrane
which now serves only as a case or capsule The tube of corium thus
enclosed with its contained muscles shrinks a little and soon can be
perceived to be in process of dividing into new and smaller segments
in one instance ten in numberwhich at the next exuviation would no
doubt be invested with an external membrane and be freely exposed In
another instance the pedicel of a posterior cirrus had been cut off
and subsequently closed in this instance a whole immature miniature
cirrus with the two rami each having fifteen minute segments was
thus enclosed in what had been the single lower segment of the pedicel
I have seen several specimens of Balanus balanoides as described
under that species with several of the cirri and the penis truncated
but I believe this was owing to monstrosity which seemed particularly
to affect the male organs of generation for no reparation seemed to be
in progress In a specimen of Coronula however the penis appeared to
have been really cut off by accident it had been closed by a scab
with concentric lines like the articular rings on the penis itself
and within the case thus formed the corium had healed and had become
pointed but inverted I presume that the point would after another
exuviation have been everted and its length thus increased


Geographical Range and Habits

With respect to range the results arrived at have no particular
interest for the species are not sufficiently numerous and what is
still more adverse the genera with unimportant exceptions range over
the world so that there is no scale of differences and it cannot
be said that these two regions differ in their genera and these two
only in their species In all the following remarks I have trusted
exclusively to my own specific identification and have rejected all
assigned localities which appeared from any cause to be doubtful
Sessile cirripedes are found in every sea from lat   north to
Cape Horn The area included between the north point of the Philippine
Archipelago and the south point of Australia extending on the right
hand to New Zealand and on the left to Sumatraan area which
though including two distinct Cirripedial regions is small compared
with the surface of the globe yet includes a greater number of
species especially of peculiar species than the whole rest of the
known world This is probably in chief part due to the broken nature
of the land affording diversified habitats and to much of the coast
being rocky Cirripedes from requiring to be attached cannot live
where the shores and adjoining bottom are sandy or muddy or formed
of moving shingle hence no doubt it arises that there is such a
remarkable contrast in the great number of the species inhabiting
the bold rocky western coast of South America and the few species
living on the sloping and often sandy or muddy or shingly eastern
shores of this continent Hence also I believe it is that not many
species have been brought from India Coralreefs are not favorable to
Cirripedes consequently but few are known to inhabit the islands of
the Pacific Ocean Where Cirripedes can live though the species in no
district are numerous the individuals abound in infinite numbers I
have walked over the coastrocks of the Falkland and Chonos Islands
of Chile and Van Diemens Land fairly encrusted over wide spaces with
a continuous layer of Cirripedes consisting of only two or three
species in the same manner as may be observed on many parts of the
shores of Great Britain and I believe of North America

With respect to the effects of temperature on the range of Cirripedes
no genus having more than one species is confined to the torrid
zones Pyrgoma from being always attached to corals is of course
ordinarily found in the hotter seas but one species ranges from the
Cape de Verde Islands in the torrid zone to the southern shores of
England and Ireland Tetraclita is not found in the colder seas but
is numerous in species and in individuals on the southern shores of
Australia and at the Cape of Good Hope I may here add that the two
genera with the most confined ranges are Chamsipho and Elminius
the former has only two species one inhabiting Australia and the
other the East Indian Archipelago Elminius has four species confined
to the southern hemisphere and inhabiting Australia New Zealand
and South America To return to the effects of temperature in Mr
Danas great work on Crustacea an excellent chart is given in which
the isocrymal lines or those exhibiting the mean temperature of
the waters along their course for the coldest thirty consecutive
days in any season of the year are given and which lines Mr Dana
has shown are the most influential in governing the distribution of
marine animals At the isocryme of  Mr Dana divides the torrid
and subtorrid zones from the several temperate zones and at  the
temperate from the subfrigid and frigid zones but as no Cirripedes
are exclusively confined to these frigid zones we may here disregard
them From Mr Danas table of the areas of the torrid and
temperate oceanzones on both sides of the equator it seems that
they are nearly as  to  in relative area and consequently he
remarks that the marine species in any class if distributed equally
over the two would be one fifth more numerous in the torrid than in
the temperate zones Now of Cirripedes taking all the orders there
are at present known  species of these  have doubtful habitats
leaving  for comparison Of these  nearly one quarter or
 inhabit both the torrid and temperate zones as above defined
 are found exclusively in the torrid and  exclusively in the
temperate zones so that the temperate zones though less in area
and having proportionally even a considerably lesser length of
coastline nevertheless have a preponderance in the number of species
But it should be borne in mind that there are two great temperate
districts separated from each other by one great torrid district
and inasmuch as the number of species in any region seems to depend in
some degree on the isolation of the subregions we might have expected
the other conditions now being and the past conditions having been
alike that the two great temperate areas would have contained more
species perhaps doubly more than the single great torrid area

     Crustacea United States Exploring Expedition p 
    corrected

The proportional numbers above given are not very widely different
whether we take separately the Balanid the Lepadid or all
together Mr Dana has shown at length that generally amongst
the Crustacea the species which he considers of highest rank belong
to the extratorrid zones there seems to me in all such cases to
be some degree of vagueness in the attempt to determine which are
highest or lowest but I have already elsewhere stated that Balanus
is probably the most eminently Cirripedial form and exhibits in the
strongest manner all the characters by which Cirripedes differ from
other Crustacea as this genus is the largest containing  species
of which the habitats are known I may state that of these exactly one
third or  inhabit both zones  exclusively inhabiting the torrid
and  exclusively the temperate zones According to the proportions of
the whole class the numbers should have been  torrid to only 
temperate so that evidently the genus Balanus in one sense typical
inclines towards the temperate regions more strongly than does either
the family or the subclass to which it belongs

     Ibid p 

With respect to the relation between the size acquired by the different
species of sessile cirripedes and the temperature of the localities
inhabited by them the genera Chthamalus Tetraclita and Balanus
alone can serve for comparison in Chthamalus much the largest species
is found in the temperate zone on the other hand the two largest
species of Tetraclita are from the torrid zone though one of them
also sometimes ranges into the temperate seas in Balanus the largest
species and six other species having a basal diameter sometimes over
two inches inhabit the temperate regions and two out of these seven
species flourish even in the Arctic seas whereas within the torrid
zone there are only three species with a diameter sometimes exceeding
two inches but two of these frequently become very large and massive
so that Balanus judging from the size of the species as well as
from their range does not require for its highest development the
temperature of the torrid zones

The greater number of the species of the Balanid have wide ranges as
might be inferred from the fact of between one third and one fourth
of the total number inhabiting both the torrid and temperate zones
but it should not be overlooked that those species as Balanus
tintinnabulum amphitrite improvisus and in a lesser degree
B trigonus and Tetraclita radiata which seem to range over
nearly the whole world excepting the colder seas are species which
are habitually attached to ships and which could hardly fail to be
widely transported Indeed it appears to me surprising that such
species as Balanus psittacus and eburneus which often become
attached to vessels should still be confined the one to Southern
and the other to Northern America But some other Cirripedes which
I have never seen attached to vessels have likewise immense ranges
thus Tetraclita porosa is found in every tropical and warmer sea
and Chthamalus stellatus ranges round the world in the northern
hemisphere and along the eastern side of America far south of the
equator Balanus spongicola and Acasta spongites extend from the
shores of Britain to the Cape of Good Hope Balanus lvis ranges from
Tierra del Fuego to California I may further remark that the only two
other species of Balanus and the one Chthamalus inhabiting Tierra
del Fuego are also found on the shores of Peru But to show the
powers of endurance in some species I may specify the case of Balanus
improvisus which flourishes on the coast of Nova Scotia amongst
the West Indian Islands in Southern Patagonia and near Guayaquil
Even more striking is the case of B crenatus of which I have seen
specimens from latitude   north from the West Indies and the
Cape of Good Hope In these two latter localities however it seems to
be rare and may have been first transported to them from the shores of
Europe on the bottoms of vessels to which it sometimes adheres

The several species of Balanid live attached either to coastrocks
or to objects at various depths down to as in the case of Balanus
crenatus  fathoms Balanus balanoides sometimes adheres to rocks
or wood so high up that it is not covered by water during the neap
tides Mr Thompson has informed me that he once accidentally kept
some specimens of this species out of water for seven days in a warm
room and that they were then quite lively This species is very
easily killed by brackish water as are some other species whilst B
improvisus and eburneus can flourish in it and at the Falkland
Islands I saw Elminius Kingii attached to rocks at the mouth of
a freshwater brook so as to be covered by pure water during the
ebb of each tide Sessile cirripedes adhere to all sorts of objects
floating and fixed animal and vegetable living and dead organic and
inorganic Chthamalus is perhaps more commonly attached to rocks than
are the other genera Living Mollusca are I think the most frequent
objects of attachment Mr Cuming has remarked to me that shells
covered by an epidermis as Patella Haliotis and Mytilus are the
greatest favorites Acasta is always imbedded in sponges or in the
spongelike bark of Isis Pyrgoma and Creusia in corals Chelonobia is
attached to turtles and one species to crabs or very smooth shells
Coronula Tubicinella and Xenobalanus are imbedded in the skin of
Cetaceans and Platylepas in that of manatee turtles or seasnakes

If we attempt with our present not very imperfect materials to
divide the globe into provinces according to the amount of difference
in their Cirripedial inhabitants including all orders and families
and disregarding entirely as I think we ought all probabilities or
conclusions deduced from the distribution of other tribes of animals
we find that the globe may be divided into the four following great
provinces and one subprovince I should premise that in the following
remarks and tables the species of Lepas Conchoderma Chelonobia
Coronula Platylepas and Tubicinella are excluded owing to their
being attached to floating or swimming objects and being consequently
widely and irregularly distributed

     As the number of Cirripedes in the whole class is not very
    great I have given lists of the species in the four main provinces
    and in the one subprovince

The first or North Atlantic province is that of Europe and the
eastern shores of North America from the arctic regions to lat 
the island of Madeira part of the northwest coast of Africa and the
whole Mediterranean being included In this province the abovenamed
genera being excluded we have  species of which  are not found in
any other distant quarter of the globe As some few of these species
range into the West Indies I have not on this account excluded them
from the  peculiar forms Had I included the West Indies in my
first province the total number of species would have been  of
which  would have been peculiar The coast of Brazil even as far
south as the Rio Plata might also have been included for I have not
seen from it a single species not included in the above  West Indian
species So also by adding a single species might the west coast of
equatorial Africa The two coasts of South America and Africa which
face each other within the torrid zone seem to be remarkably barren
in Cirripedes Europe has several more species than the United States
which is inhabited by only ten species including even the probably
imported Balanus tintinnabulum and amphitrite Of these ten United
States species only two are not found in Europe and both these two
range into the West Indies and as far as the northern shores of South
America and therefore cannot be considered as peculiar to the United
States

     The total number of species which I have seen from the West
    Indies is  or  of these only  are peculiar to it or  if
    the United States be likewise included the other  or  species
    being found in other quarters of the world Six peculiar species
    out of  or  has not appeared to me sufficient to institute
    even a subprovince

I have formed my single subprovince for the southern extremity of
Africa for although I know of only  species from this comparatively
short and uniform line of coast yet I was not able to group these
eleven in any of the main provinces  of the species are peculiar
 Australian  European and West Indian and  almost universally
distributed

The second province includes the west coast of North and South America
from Tierra del Fuego to Behrings Straits on this enormously long
line of coast only  species are known to exist but of these no
less than  are peculiar Of these  four are not found south of
the torrid equatorial region and eight are not known to occur north
of this same region so that this long line of coast might have been
divided into two subprovinces of which the southern would have been
the most peculiar but as eight species are found both north and south
of the equatorial region I have not made this subdivision Two of
the species occurring on the western coast of North America seem to
represent species found on its eastern coast and in Europe thus
Balanus glandula takes the places of B crenatus and B cariosus
that of B balanoides Not a single species excepting a few which
are also widely distributed over other parts of the world is known to
be common to the east and west coasts of the two Americas

The third province is that of the East Indian Archipelago and includes
the Philippines Borneo New Guinea Sumatra Java Malacca and the
eastern coast of India Here we find  species of which  are
peculiar I may remark that I have received no species from Madagascar
or the eastern coast of Africa few from India or from the coast of
China and I suspect that on most of these coasts only few exist
Probably our third province will hereafter be found to include the
whole Indian Ocean

The fourth province is that of Australia including New Zealand it
has  species of which  are peculiar Had the temperate Australian
coasts i e those south of the isocryme of  been alone
considered the number of the species would have been probably  of
which  would have been peculiarthat is if we admit within the
 several species which range from the temperate into the torrid
zone but do not extend beyond the Australian shores Owing to the
widelyextended ranges of most Cirripedes no Arctic or Antarctic
provinces can be said to exist

To recapitulate the above results bearing in mind that although the
total number of known existing Cirripedes is  yet that the habitats
of seven are unknown and that eighteen are excluded owing to their
being attached to floating or swimming objects so that there are only
 species referred to in the following table

   Fourth or Australian province                            
  

The least prolific of these provinces contains  species or between
th and th of the total number of species and the most prolific
between rd and th of this same number In each of these
provinces it is remarkable that the peculiar species are very nearly
two thirds of the whole of its inhabitants These facts I think show
that the above provinces are natural divisions of the world as far as
their Cirripedial inhabitants are concerned

As Cirripedes belong to the great class of Crustacea and as the
distribution of the latter has lately been fully discussed by Mr Dana
it may be worth while briefly to compare my results with his more
especially as they are so very different I should premise as perhaps
accounting to a certain extent for this difference that owing to the
wide range of many species and the almost universal extension of the
same genera my provinces are founded merely on a certain proportion
of the species namely two thirds being peculiar or confined to a
region of considerable dimensions whereas in the case of ordinary
Crustaceans the greater number of the species are distinct even in
the subprovinces and the provinces are founded mainly on generic
differences Mr Dana divides the surface of the globe into three great
sections or provinces the AfricoEuropan the extent of which is
shown by its title the Occidental which includes both the east and
west coast of both Americas and the Oriental including the Indian
and Pacific Oceans with the East Indian Archipelago and Australia
Thus Mr Dana entirely separates the Eastern shores of North America
from Europe whereas as far as their Cirripedial inhabitants are
concerned they are most intimately allied and form my first or North
Atlantic province and to this as I have shown even the West Indies
the coast of Brazil and equatorial West Africa might have been added
It follows from this similarity in the Cirripedes on the two sides of
the Atlantic and from their dissimilarity with those on the shores of
the Pacific that the east and west coasts of the two Americas form two
quite distinct Cirripedial provinces though in the northern half
some connection is shown by a few representative species on the other
hand Mr Dana unites both sides of the whole American continent
into his single Occidental province The SouthAfrican province is not
brought out by Mr Dana so prominently as I have found necessary Mr
Dana joins the East Indian Archipelago and Australia into his single
Oriental province and makes New Zealand as a subprovince apparently
as distinct from Australia as Australia is from the East Indian
Archipelago whereas I find that the Cirripedes of New Zealand clearly
belong to Australia and that the Australian Cirripedes especially if
the temperate shores be alone considered are as distinct from those of
the East Indian Archipelago as from those of any other quarter of the
whole world I believe that the provinces deduced from the distribution
of Cirripedes accord better with the Molluscan provinces than with
those given by Mr Dana for the rest of the great class of Crustaceans

In the following tables an asterisk means that the species is not
found in any other distinct region of the globe When found in one
of the five provinces a corresponding number within brackets is
appended to show in which province or subprovince it has been found

Geological History

The ancient history of the Balanid is a brief one No secondary
species has hitherto been discovered in my monograph on the fossil
Lepadid I have shown that the negative evidence in this case is of
considerable value and consequently that there is much reason to doubt
whether any member of the family did exist before the Eocene period
The existence of a Cretaceous Verruca is an apparent exception to the
rule as this genus has hitherto always been ranked amongst sessile
cirripedes but Verruca as we now know must be placed in a family by
itself quite distinct from the Balanid Balanus is the oldest genus
as yet known it first appeared in Europe and North America during
the deposition of the eocene beds and was at that time as far as our
information at present serves represented by very few species In
South America one species of Balanus abounds in individuals in the
ancient Patagonian tertiary formation I have seen in the British
Museum specimens said to have come from the eocene nummulitic beds
near the mouth of the Indus belonging to the second section of the
genus Generally the extinct forms belong to the last section of
this genus which has the parietes not permeated by pores During the
miocene and pliocene ages sessile cirripedes abounded No extinct
genus in this family has hitherto been discovered It is singular
that though the Chthamalin approach much more closely than do the
Balanin to the ancient Lepadid of which so many species have been
found fossil even in the older Secondary formations yet that only one
species of one genus of this subfamily has been hitherto found in any
deposit and that species is the still existing Pachylasma giganteum
in the modern beds of Sicily During the epoch of the Glacial deposits
in Scandinavia Scotland and Canada the still existing species seem
to have abounded and they attained larger average dimensions than
the same species now do on the shores of Great Britain or even on the
shores of the northern United States where the average size seems
larger than on this side of the Atlantic

     Since the note to page  of that work was written I have been
    informed that the socalled cretaceous Tubicinella maxima is not
    a Cirripede

Under the genus Balanus I have given my reasons for never naming
species in this large and difficult genus without examining the
opercular valves it has been owing to this as it appears to me
proper want of caution that there are so many nominal species Thus
it is made to appear in catalogues that the tertiary seas abounded
with species of Balanus to an extent now quite unparalleled in any
quarter of the world Bronn for instance in his invaluable
Index Palontologicus gives the names of  Balani found fossil in
Europe and I have not counted those found only in alluvial deposits
as they would certainly be the same as the still living species Now
I know only  recent Balani on the shores of all Europe from the
North Pole to lat  and of these I doubt whether B balanoides
and improvisus have been found fossil In the Red Crag there is one
extinct Balanus in the Coralline Crag which seems to have been very
favorable to the existence of Cirripedes there are six species of
Balani of which two are absolutely extinct and one does not occur
in any neighbouring sea in the Eocene formations the species seem to
have been rare and I have seen only one and that is an extinct form
Taking these several facts into consideration and bearing in mind
that Cirripedes usually range widely I do not believe if all the
specimens of Balani hitherto found in the several tertiary formations
from the eocene to the glacial deposits throughout Europe were
collected together they would amount to  species I have myself
seen in a recognisable state only  fossil species of which five
are extinct or not found in any neighbouring sea I think it probable
that three other recent species viz B tulipiformis perforatus
and amphitrite may occur in the Mediterranean formations and this
would make  species Therefore in the above estimate of  species
five are allowed for species existing in European collections
but not hitherto seen by me and this I believe is a very full
allowance Consequently even on the supposition that the five
species just admitted as possibly existing in cabinets and that the
other five extinct species which I have seen and examined have all
been previously named by other authors a supposition excessively
improbable even then there would be  superfluous names in Bronn

     To save any other person interested in fossil Cirripedia
    going through the several works quoted by Bronn I have given some
    remarks on his list of species in an appendix at the end of the
    Balanid

The following short table shows how Cirripedes including all three
Families were represented in Great Britain throughout the several

As affording some standard of comparison by which to compare the number
of fossil species at any period in relation to the number of species
probably existing in the neighbouring seas during the same epoch I
may state that there are now living and propagating on the shores of
Great Britain  species belonging to the three Families included
in the above table I have not counted three species in the genera
Alcippe and Conchoderma which from the minuteness of their valves
it is hardly possible would be found fossil On the other hand I have
included in the  five species of Lepas which from floating and
being oceanic are more likely to be cast up on beaches than to be
imbedded in sedimentary deposits so that  would perhaps be a safer
number as a standard of comparison Now in the coralline crag which
seems to have been eminently favorable for the existence and subsequent
preservation of Cirripedes and which has been so well worked only
nine fossil species as may be seen in the table have been as yet
discovered

     At the end of the volume a Synopsis is given which will serve
    as a systematic index for the discovery of generic and specific
    names


The Balanid may be divided into two subfamilies namely the Balanin
and Chthamalin and in the former the genera as we see may be
very naturally grouped into two sections The Balanin differ from the
Chthamalin as far as the shell is concerned in the rostrum having
radii but no al all the lateral compartments having both radii and
al on the other hand in the Chthamalin the rostrum has al and
the rostrolateral compartments radii on both sides and therefore
no al These differences probably arise as already explained from
the perfect confluence in the Balanin of the true rostrum with the
rostrolateral compartments In Chelonobia belonging to the Balanin
we see an intermediate state with the fusion not quite effected
on the other hand in one genus amongst the Chthamalin namely
Pachylasma we must look to the shell at a very early age to find the
rostrum with its al distinct from the rostrolateral compartments
In Tetraclita Elminius and Creusia the carinolateral compartments
are aborted or possibly confluent with the lateral compartments
making altogether only four in Pyrgoma all the compartments are
fused together and form a solid ring The subgenus Acasta is in
one sense very natural as it includes species most closely allied
in another sense it is far from natural as some of the species can
hardly be distinguished from those species of Balanus which live
attached to Gorgoni I almost regret I did not merge the species of
Acasta into Balanus In the Balanin generally the parietes are either
porose or are furnished on their internal surfaces with regular ribs
representing the longitudinal parietal septa which in other species
form the tubes or pores there are however many exceptions to this
rule in several species of Balanus in Acasta and Elminius all of
which have the parietes of their shells internally quite smooth or
only irregularly roughened with points

Looking to the animals body in the Balanin the labrum is always
notched in the middle and is never swollen or bullate for the outer
and inner folds of membrane of which it is composed lie close together
The palpi are large so that their tips almost touch each other The
mandibles generally have their lower main teeth laterally double
Of the cirri the third pair invariably much more closely resembles
in its whole structure and in its action the second than the fourth
pairs and it is also generally separated by a small interval from the
fourth pair

I have already under the Family sufficiently entered on the relations
of the Balanin to the Chthamalin and of the genera one to the
other so that I need not here add anything

I can point out no difference in habits or geographical distribution
between the Balanin and Chthamalin




 GenusBALANUS Auct

     The name Balanus was used almost as at present by Lister and
    Hill before the introduction of the binomial system Since that
    period the first two authors as far as I know who used this name
    were Da Costa in his Hist Nat Test Brit in  and Bock
    in the Naturforscher for the same year Bock however applied
    it to a Chelonobia

General appearanceThe shape of the shell in the different
species varies from depressed conical to cylindrical the latter
form being generally assumed when specimens are crowded together but
some species as B balanoides crenatus and lvis seem more
subject than others to be thus affected The colour is either white
generally tinted by the yellowish or brownish epidermis or any colour
intermediate between bright pink and rich blue purple being the
prevailing tint The persistence of the socalled epidermis is very
different in different species being even sometimes highly variable in
the same species The surface is either smooth or more commonly folded
longitudinally or sharply ribbed The orifice differs in form from
diamondshape to trigonal the carinal end owing to the shape of the
carina being always sharper or narrower than the rostral end The size
of the orifice in proportion to the shell varies accordingly as the
latter is more or less conical or cylindrical The orifice is either
entire or more or less deeply toothed in proportion to the degree of
obliquity of the summits of the radii and al The radii almost always
have smoother surfaces than the parietes In some few species the
radii are not developed the sutures being marked only by fissurelike
lines in others they are very narrow and in this case their upper
margins are generally rounded and smooth instead of being straight
and jagged The carinolateral compartments are usually much narrower
than the lateral compartments occasionally in an extreme degree as in
B allium The shell is generally strong sometimes to a wonderful
degree but the strength and thickness vary in the individuals of some
of the species By the action of hot caustic potash the compartments
in several species such as B Hameri and crenatus separate on a
touch in others they adhere so strongly as to prove that the sutures
must be calcified together In this genus we have the largest known
sessile cirripede viz the B psittacus and on the other hand many
small species but it is very difficult except in wellknown species
to ascertain the average or even the maximum dimensions

ScutumThis valve is almost triangular with the basitergal corner
more or less rounded off The prominent lines of growth are sometimes
crossed by longitudinal stri Internally the articular ridge projects
to a very different degree in the different species its lower end is
sometimes as in B lvis Pl  fig  c produced downwards as a
small sharp free style there is always an articular furrow receiving
the inflected margin of the tergum There is always an impression left
by the attachment of the adductor scutorum muscle and often its lower
side is bounded more or less closely by a sharp adductor ridge running
some way down the valve this ridge is occasionally almost confluent
in its upper part with the articular ridge and in this case sometimes
it forms together with the inflected tergal margin a large tubular
cavity running up as in B psittacus Pl  fig  c almost
to the apex of the valve Almost invariably there is a slight pit or
depression for the lateral depressor muscle sometimes within the
depression there is a little ridge as in B perforatus and nubilus
Pl  fig  a and Pl  fig  a and in the case of B
vestitus flosculus and imperator Pl  figs  a  a
there are regular crests for this same purpose The rostral depressor
muscle is usually attached in a small pit formed by the folding over of
the lower part of the occludent margin in B imperator Pl  fig
 a there are regular crests for its attachment and traces of them
may be discovered in B vestitus

TergumThis valve is more nearly triangular than any other shape
with the spur more or less prominent The apex generally projects a
little above the level of the scutum in some species it consists of
a triangular and solid in others Pl  fig  b of an almost
cylindrical extremely sharp inwardly curved and very prominent beak
This beak is generally purple it is sometimes hollow and occupied by
a thread of corium Its formation and the apparent sliding up of the
whole tergum so as to project above the scutum has been described
under the family From an account given to me by a person who kept
B porcatus alive the beaks appear to be used when the operculum
is touched as an organ of defencethe animal striking with them
The tergal margin is more or less inflected and the carinal margin
is convex in different degrees and in some species is added to
by upturned zones of growth The basal margin either forms a nearly
straight line on opposite sides of the spur or more commonly slopes
towards it in various manners The spur or basal projection is
rarely placed in the middle of the basal margin generally near
sometimes close to the basiscutal angle it varies much in length
and breadth and is sometimes even half the width of the valve The
surface of the valve is almost always more or less depressed sometimes
so much as to form a deepish furrow the longitudinal furrow which
extends from the apex to the extremity of the spur When the furrow is
deep its sides as the specimen grows old almost always become folded
inwards so as to touch and then the furrow becomes converted into a
closed fissure in this latter case the folded sides generally form a
central crest on the spur Internally in the middle of the upper part
of the valve the articular ridge is more or less prominent forming
the carinal margin of the articular furrow in which the articular
ridge of the scutum is lodged occasionally however this articular
ridge can hardly be said to exist In most species the tergal depressor
muscle is attached to sharp crests on the basicarinal corner of the
valve but these are almost obliterated in other species

CompartmentsThe external appearance of the shell has already been
described In the most typical species the parietes consist of an
outer and inner lamina separated by strong longitudinal septa these
septa are denticulated on both sides at their bases but only close
to the inner lamina in fact the inner lamina is apparently formed by
the union thickening and production of some of the denticuli As
it is not the innermost of the denticuli on the basal edges of the
longitudinal septa which thus become united into a solid layer the
longitudinal septa form slightly projecting longitudinal ribs on the
inner lamina These internal ribs are longitudinally striated in
old specimens they often become obliterated especially in the upper
part of the shell The parietal tubes or pores occupied by threads
of corium are generally square and large but in B Ajax they
are very small and in B glandula often extremely minute In the
upper part of the shell and sometimes low down they are generally
crossed by thin transverse calcareous septa in some species as
in B perforatus and in some varieties of B amphitrite the
upper ends of the tubes are filled up solidly with shell In some
varieties of B crenatus and of amphitrite the longitudinal septa
near the outer lamina divide thus giving rise to a very imperfect
row of outer short tubes In B vinaceus Pl  fig  d the
inner lamina is cancellated instead of being solid which is caused
by the basal denticuli of the longitudinal septa being simply united
together by their ends and crossed by transverse septa instead of
being consolidated into a mass In several species as in B Hameri
the walls consist only of the outer lamina with longitudinal ribs no
inner lamina having been formed the ribs here evidently answer to the
longitudinal septa in the foregoing species In B flosculus and
imperator the walls are solid their basal margins being formed of
irregular elongated points and little ridges Pl  fig  c
which apparently prefigure the more regular longitudinal ribs or septa
In B balanoides the walls are generally either nearly smooth and
solid or irregularly cancellated in B cariosus Pl  fig  b
two or three rows of short irregular tubes are formed by unequally
branching septa almost as in the genus Tetraclita

The Radii in all the species are constructed essentially on the
same plan as the parietes thus in the typical forms there is an
outer and inner lamina with septa which near the inner lamina are
furnished with denticuli on both sides hence the radii are permeated
by pores or tubes like the parietes but this holds good only in the
first section of the genus for in the other species the tubes are
filled up quite solidly The denticuli on the septa often occur only on
one side or disappear altogether and lastly the septa themselves
often appear merely like little teeth or disappear altogether as in
B Hameri or occur only near the bases of the radii as in B
amaryllis A slight furrow in the compartment against which each
radius abuts is generally marked by the septa and their denticuli In
regard to the al their lateral or sutural edges are either thin
and smooth or more commonly finely crenated or ribbed The little
transverse crenations are homologous with the septa in the radii and
parietes The edges of the al are usually received in a furrow The
diametric growth of the shell is effected by the growth of the radii
and al and chiefly by that of the former The sutural and lateral
edges of both radii and al are added to either quite up to their
summits or only low down and during the continued growth of the
shell lower and lower down in accordance with this difference in
growth the summits of the radii and al become either very oblique
or they extend parallel to the basis that is from tip to tip of the
adjoining compartments When the radii and al are added to as is most
usual above the level of the opercular membrane and therefore above
the sack ribbons of corium run up the sutures from the sack higher
or lower according to the height to which in the different species
the edges of the radii and al continue to be added to The obliquity
of the summits of the radii and al varies in some cases in the same
species It often happens that when the summits of the radii are very
oblique the summits of the al are but little so and the converse
both however are often either equally oblique or both have square
summits The sheath extends either one third or more than half down
the shell its basal margin often Pl  fig  K freely depends
or overhangs the inner lamina of the walls

BasisIn typical species the basis is calcareous and consists of
an upper and lower lamina separated by radiating septa forming pores
In the same manner as the septa of the parietes sometimes though
rarely become irregularly divided near the outer lamina forming
outer pores so it is but in a much more marked degree with the
basis The basis in such cases becomes extremely thick and consists
of an upper thin lamina with the regular radiating septa and pores
and of an underlying thick cancellated mass which seems wholly to
result from the dividing and subdividing of the septa The basal
radiating pores like the parietal pores are closed at intervals by
calcareous transverse septa The basal points of the parietal septa
enter the orifices of the basal pores and the threads of corium pass
into the latter between the denticuli of the parietal septa In some
species as in B crenatus and Hameri the basis is perfectly
solid the upper lamina being absent just as in some species the
internal lamina of the parietes is absent In B flosculus the basis
is calcareous but consists of so excessively thin a film as hardly
to be distinguished it presents moreover as also is the case with
B imperator a beaded structure Again in some few species as
in B balanoides the basis is simply membranous When the basis
is thin it is always flat and is closely moulded to the irregular
surface of attachment and in this case when specimens are crowded
together their elongation is effected exclusively by the growth of the
walls but when the basis is thick it sometimes becomes in crowded
groups deeply but irregularly cupformed or cylindrical as in B
psittacus and perforatus In B allium however which inhabits
massive corals the basis is as regularly concave or cupformed as
in the genus Pyrgoma in B calceolus and its allies and in some
varieties of the fossil B inclusus the basis is boatformed with
its lower surface deeply grooved longitudinally from clasping the
stem of the Gorgonia or other zoophyte to which it was attached
In certain varieties of B lvis it is very remarkable that the
deeply cupformed basis becomes owing apparently to the whole shell
having grown too deep for the animal halffilled up with irregular
calcareous transverse plates Pl  fig  a resting one upon the
other by irregular points or pillars The cementing apparatus has been
sufficiently described under the Family

MouthThe labrum is always notched sometimes it has no teeth
but generally there are three on each side in B balanoides there
are five or six on each side and in B improvisus and eburneus
there is a whole row of teeth Pl  fig  e graduated in
size on each side of the notch The palpi are large with their
apices nearly touching and furnished with long spines The mandibles
have as it appears normally five teeth but the two lower teeth
are always small and often rudimentary and almost confluent with
the inferior sometimes spinose angle The maxill have either a
simple edge or a notch under the pair of large upper spines or the
lower part forms Pl  fig  a stepformed projection there are
generally two lower spines placed singly or not in pairs larger than
the others with the exception of the uppermost pair The outer
maxill are on their inner faces obscurely divided into two lobes

CirriThe rami of the first pair are unequal the shorter one
sometimes not being more than half the length of the other ramus
the segments of the shorter ramus are broad and are together with
the lower segments of the longer ramus thickly clothed with spines
in some species as in B perforatus the anterior surfaces of the
segments more especially of the shorter ramus and of both rami of the
second pair are produced Pl  fig  so as sometimes to form very
remarkable projections The segments of the second and third pairs are
always thickly clothed with spines as also are their pedicels The
third pair is rather longer than the second but in B vestitus and
imperator it is much longer and is otherwise somewhat different
The dorsal and basal margin of the pedicel of the third pair in some
of the species as in B tintinnabulum is produced backwards on the
thorax and forms a membranous plate fringed with fine spines The
three posterior and longer pairs of cirri have from three to rarely
eight or ten pairs of long spines on each segment with generally one
or two minute spines in the middle between each pair their pedicels
have a regular double row of spines

The penis is long and hairy in most of the species there is at its
dorsal basis a small sharp flattened imperforate projection first
observed by Poli but this is sometimes absent as in B crenatus
though present in the closely allied B balanoides and its presence
is variable in B tintinnabulum All the species have large plicated
branchi The base of the sack in several species is furnished
with inwardly projecting filamentary appendages In B perforatus
crenatus and improvisus and I believe in other species the upper
part of the stomach is furnished with a circle of branching cca


On the variation of the species their arrangement and affinities
value of the characters used changes during growthOwing to the
great variation in external characters to which almost all the species
are subject and likewise to the genus being a very natural one that
is to the species following each other in close and natural order it
is not easy to exaggerate the difficulty of identifying the species
except by a deliberate examination of the internal and external
structure of each individual specimen Every one who has collected
sessile cirripedes must have perceived to what an extent their shape
depends on their position and grouping The surface of attachment has
a great effect on that of the shell for as the walls are added to at
their bases every portion has at one time been in close contact with
the supporting surface thus I have seen a stronglyribbed species
B porcatus and a nearly smooth species B crenatus closely
resembling each other and both having a peculiar appearance owing
to their having been attached to a pecten Dr Gray has pointed out
to me specimens of B patellaris curiously pitted like the wood
to which they had adhered and numberless other instances might be
added Quite independently of the effect produced by the surface of
attachment the degree to which the longitudinal folds and ribs are
developed on the parietes is variable in most of the species as in
B tintinnabulum vestitus and even in B porcatus the presence
or entire absence of these ribs often surprisingly alters the whole
aspect of the shell The persistence of the socalled epidermis is in
some degree variable and in B lvis we have groups of specimens
absolutely naked and others uniformly clothed with a brown membrane
Again some species in certain localities are all subject to the
disintegration of the entire outer lamina of the walls and in such
cases as with B perforatus there is not the smallest resemblance
between the corroded and perfect specimens The size of the orifice
and consequently of the operculum compared with the shell itself
varies accordingly as the shell is more or less conical or cylindrical
in the latter case the summits of the radii are generally more oblique
and the aperture consequently more deeply toothed than in the more
conical varieties Size is a serviceable character in some cases but
very many specimens are required to ascertain the average or maximum
size of each species for there is no method of distinguishing a
halfgrown from a fullgrown specimen and I believe as long as the
individual lives so long does it go on moulting and growing Colour
is of very considerable service though the precise tint varies greatly
in almost every species and what is a far more serious evil the
majority of the species have their white or nearly white varieties the
latter sometimes as numerous as the coloured ones in B perforatus
lvis flosculus amphitrite and in several other species the
common white varieties are eminently deceptive

Besides the slight variation in the obliquity of the summits of the
radii and al dependent on the more or less cylindrical form of
the shell in some species as in B tintinnabulum amphitrite
improvisus trigonus and porcatus their obliquity also varies
occasionally from unknown causes and thus greatly affects the general
appearance of the shell In some few species as in B perforatus
the radii are often either not at all developed or are of very
variable width in others when the shell has become cylindrical or
when very old the radii cease to grow and from the disintegration of
the whole upper part of the shell with the continued growth of the
lower part the radii at last come to exist as mere fissures I have
seen instances of this in B psittacus nigrescens and porcatus
Nevertheless the obliquity of the upper margin and the breadth of the
radii are useful characters and still more useful is the fact whether
the upper margins are smooth and arched or straight and jagged The
fact of the terga being more or less beaked is useful as is likewise
the presence of stri or furrows or rows of pits radiating from the
apices of the scuta but to ascertain the presence of these marks
it is almost invariably necessary to take out the scuta clean and
examine them with a lens these ridges and furrows moreover in some
species as is strikingly the case with B tintinnabulum and in
less degree with B trigonus lvis and concavus appear and
disappear and vary without any apparent cause

Now if we reflect that form size state and nature of the surface
presence of epidermis relative size of the orifice presence of
longitudinal ribs tint and often the existence of any colour are
all highly variable in most of the species and that the obliquity
of the summits of the radii and the presence of longitudinal stri
on the scuta are variable in several species we shall perceive how
difficult it must ever be to distinguish the species from external
characters As some evidence of this I may mention that after having
described nearly  species and when my eye was naturally able to
appreciate small differences I began carefully to examine varieties of
B tintinnabulum amphitrite improvisus porcatus vestitus
c without even a suspicion that they belonged to these species at
that time thoroughly well known to me yet in the cases here referred
to there could be no doubt when a perfect series was examined
that the specimens were only varieties From this cause the labour
of naming a collection is great Let no one attempt to identify the
species of this genus without being prepared to disarticulate clean
and carefully examine with a microscope the basis and parietes and
both the under and upper surfaces of the opercular valves for I feel
convinced that he will otherwise throw away much labour Moreover in
many cases it is almost necessary on account of the variability of
the characters to possess several specimens From these facts I have
not hesitated to form my sections on characters which require close
examination though I would gladly have seized on external characters
could I have found such even moderately constant

The least varying and therefore most important characters must
be taken from the internal structure of the parietes radii and
basis not that these characters are absolutely invariable thus the
porosity of the parietes is slightly variable in B glandula and
highly variable in the fossil B unguiformis it is also highly
variable in B balanoides but under a systematic point of view
this is unimportant as the section including this latter species is
well defined by the membranous basis The porosity of the basis is in
some degree variable in B nubilus improvisus and patellaris
and in B flosculus we see signs of a passage from a calcareous to
a membranous basis Characters derived from the general shape and
from the ridges and depressions on the under side of the scuta and
terga especially of the scuta are highly serviceable The terga
indeed in many species as in B amphitrite vary considerably
and are affected by the general shape of the shell Unfortunately the
differences are not very great between the scuta of the different
species The cause of the opercular valves offering more useful
characters as far as outline is concerned than do the walls of
the shell is no doubt due to their being almost independent of any
influence from the nature of the surface of attachment Even the ridges
and depressions on the under side of the scuta which are in direct
connection with the muscles and soft parts of the animal vary to a
certain extent thus the length and prominence of the adductor ridge
is decidedly variable in B concavus and tintinnabulum and in a
less degree in B lvis the size and form of the little cavity for
the lateral depressor muscle varies in many species so does the exact
shape and degree of prominence of the articular ridge There is one
character in the terga which at first would be thought very useful
namely whether an open longitudinal furrow or a closed fissure
runs down the valve from the apex to the spur but it is found that
the furrow almost always gradually closes up during growth and as a
consequence of this the width of the spur compared to that of the
whole valve as well as its distance from the basiscutal angle and
the form of its basal extremity all vary in some degree The length
of the spur sometimes varies considerably as in B concavus and
amphitrite The parts of the mouth are only occasionally serviceable
for the teeth on the labrum and the state of the lower teeth on the
mandibles and the presence of a stepformed projection at the lower
angle of the maxill are all often variable The relative lengths of
the two rami of the first pair of cirri the degree of protuberance
of the segments and the number of pairs of spines on the segments of
the posterior pairs of cirri are sometimes useful but the relative
lengths of the cirri and more especially the numbers of pairs of
spines on the posterior cirri are apt to vary Finally I must
express my deliberate opinion that every part and organ internal and
external in Cirripedes is liable to some amount of variation in some
of the species

I must now point out the principal changes which supervene during
growth and which cannot properly be called variations In the first
place I think it is scarcely possible to recognise a species when
under the th of an inch in diameter In some cases as in var
dOrbignii of B tintinnabulum the shell is invariably coloured
when old but quite white when very young Generally the tints become
very much darker with age Some species which usually or invariably
have when mature longitudinally folded walls as B flosculus
and balanoides are perfectly smooth in youth The walls in B
eburneus when young have white hyaline longitudinal lines and
are naked whereas with advancing age these lines disappear and the
subsequently formed shell becomes covered with membrane The summits
of the radii are apt to be oblique in the young of B Capensis
psittacus and tintinnabulum whereas they are generally quite
square in old specimens In B eburneus cariosus and in a lesser
degree in B psittacus the scuta become longitudinally striated
only with age On the other hand in very young specimens of B
tintinnabulum the scuta sometimes are deeply impressed by little
pits placed in rows I have already alluded to the longitudinal
furrow on the tergum so entirely changing its character owing to the
edges becoming during growth folded inwards this likewise causes a
decrease in the proportional breadth of the spur In old specimens of
B flosculus var sordidus the whole tergum is much more elongated
than in young specimens The basal margin of the sheath is hollow
beneath in the young of B cariosus and of some other species but
in the old it is continuous with the inner surface of the walls The
inner lamina of the parietes generally loses to a certain extent its
longitudinally ribbed character in old age The basis is solid instead
of being porose in very young specimens of B improvisus In all the
species the carinolateral compartments in early age are very narrow
in proportion to the width of the lateral compartments and in all at
this early period the operculum is large in proportion to the whole
shell The number of spines on the edge of the maxill the number of
segments in all the cirri and the number of spines on each segment
are few in early youth and go on increasing with each successive
exuviation the pedicels of the cirri are long in proportion to the
rami at this same early age

     In some specimens of Balanus perforatus I made the following
    enumeration of the number of segments in the cirri

    
                  Basal diameterBasal diameter   Medium sized

    shorter ramus                                              
                                                                
    Second cirrus      or                                  
                                                                
    Sixth cirrus      or                  in another  
    

    In the specimen th of an inch in basal diameter each segment
    of the posterior cirri carried five pairs of spines whereas
    in fullgrown specimens there are six or seven pairs In the
    th of an inch specimen on the inner maxill there were
    no spines between the upper large and the lower large pair of
    spines whereas in the th of an inch specimen there were five
    intermediate spines and in larger specimens nine or ten spines

Notwithstanding the difficulties now enumerated I hope that owing to
having examined a vast number of specimens of the most varying species
I have not fallen into very many errors I have endeavoured to err
on the side of making too few instead of too many species In those
cases however in which I have seen only a few specimens I have been
sometimes compelled to decide without sufficient evidence

I would gladly have divided this genus already including  species
into smaller genera but so far from being enabled to do so I
have been compelled to form my Sections immediately to be given
on characters not absolutely invariable and far from obvious I
was particularly anxious to separate the elongated species with a
boatformed basis which are attached to Gorgoni and which form the
genus Conopea of Say but I was unable to effect their separation even
as a subgenus for B navicula and cymbiformis graduate in the
most insensible manner through B galeatus the type of Says genus
and B calceolus into B stultus and this into B Ajax yet
this latter species has even been described as a mere variety of the
typical B tintinnabulum Indeed so insensible is this graduation
that the first and second sections of the genus are hardly distinct I
fully admit that if B stultus and Ajax had never existed B
calceolus and its three allies might have formed as natural a little
group though difficult to be characterised as does the subgenus
Acasta or perhaps this group and Acasta might have been combined
together These same species viz B calceolus and its allies
are intimately allied to B terebratus and inclusus which are
contained in the last section F of the genus and this shows that Dr
Grays proposed genus Chirona including the species with nonporose
parietes in sections E and F could hardly have been instituted
even if the porosity of the parietes had not been variable in B
unguiformis balanoides and glandula My fourth section D
founded on the basis not being porose is perhaps the weakest of the
divisions as may be seen in the list of exceptions appended to the
sectional headings

The arrangement of the species is I think as natural as a linear
one could be made every one knows how irregularly and in how many
directions the lines of affinity in every natural genus branch out
Some few species stand rather isolated as B declivis and B
allium cepa and quadrivittatus in a little group by themselves
I have already shown how the species in the first and second sections
A and B blend into each other and that the blending species are
likewise allied to some in the last section F furthermore I shall
have occasion to show that these same species can hardly be separated
naturally from the subgenus Acasta The first section moreover
passes into the third C by B tulipiformis and the third into
the fourth D by B improvisus nubilus corrugatus and
patellaris the fifth and sixth E and F sections are closely
connected together by B cariosus and flosculus and these two
sections blend into the fourth D through B unguiformis and
balanoides and lastly into the third C section by B dolosus
and improvisus

The genus as we have just seen is hardly separated from the subgenus
Acasta by B allium it tends to pass through the subgenus Creusia
into Pyrgoma and by B imperator and flosculus it graduates into
Elminius and Tetraclita


Geographical DistributionThis which is much the largest genus of
sessile cirripedes has its species scattered over the whole world
from the arctic regions in lat   where we have B crenatus
and porcatus throughout the tropical seas to Cape Horn where
B flosculus adheres to the coastrocks Many of the species have
individually very wide ranges thus B tintinnabulum and amphitrite
are found throughout the warmer seas but the wide distribution of
these species may be partly due to their frequent adhesion to ships
bottoms B crenatus ranges from the frozen seas in lat  
north to the West Indies and Cape of Good Hopea wonderful endurance
of the most opposite climates Balanus improvisus again extends
from Europe to Nova Scotia thence southward to Patagonia and up
the western coast of S America someway north of the Equator Most
of the species have considerable ranges thus of the six species
found on the eastern shores of northern America five of them occur
in Great Britain Of the thirtysix species of which the habitats
are known exactly one third or twelve inhabit both the torrid and
temperate zones these being divided by the isocryme of  nine
are found exclusively in the torrid and fifteen exclusively in the
temperate zones Within the warmer latitudes and especially in the
southern hemisphere Tetraclita and Elminius to a certain extent
supplant Balanus In depth the species range from the upper limits
of the tidal zone to even fifty fathoms Balanus improvisus and
eburneus are able to survive in brackish water The different species
are attached to various surfacesrocks shells timber floating
objects seaweed lamelliform corals Millepor Gorgoni and even to
sponges Mr G B Sowerby has remarked that in the species from
the southern hemisphere it is the basis and in the species from the
northern hemisphere it is the parietes which are elongated when the
individuals from being crowded together become cylindrical but this
is erroneous B perforatus in the northern hemisphere sometimes
has an elongated basis but no doubt the basis of our commonest
species as B balanoides crenatus and porcatus from being
either membranous or thin does not become cupshaped whereas this
structure is conspicuous in B psittacus and lvis the two
commonest species in southern South America

Fossil SpeciesHaving already given under the Family some account
of the geological history of sessile cirripedes short as it is I here
only allude to the subject in order to state my conviction that species
cannot be satisfactorily distinguished in a fossil state and rarely
in a recent state without an examination of the opercular valves
Nothing indeed could have been easier than to have affixed names
to many groups of specimens having different aspects but to feel
sure that these were really distinct species requires better evidence
than can be afforded by the shell without the operculum No doubt
in some of the smaller sections of the genusfor instance in that
characterised by a membranous basisit would have been possible to
have distinguished some or several fossil species but such have not as
yet been found When the specimens are much fossilised it is indeed
difficult to make out the primary points of structurenamely whether
the parietes radii and basis are porose to do this it is sometimes
necessary to rub down polish and carefully examine a transverse
section of a piece of the shell

     The following species might owing to variation or to the
    obscurity of their structure without care be classed in the wrong
    sectionsin A Balanus Ajax from living attached to Millepor
    is sometimes elongated in its rostrocarinal axis and from having
    its radii only finely porose it might be classed in B on the
    other hand Bal stultus is sometimes but little elongated and
    the basis hardly boatformed and hence might be classed in A The
    distinction between all the species in B and the subgenus Acasta
    is artificial

    In sections C and D I have seen one specimen of B spongicola
    with a solid basis and very young specimens of B improvisus
    are thus characterised and therefore these species are liable to
    be placed in the wrong section D Bal nubilus also has part
    of its base nonporose and therefore likewise might be placed
    in D on the other hand the circumference of the basis in B
    patellaris is often porose and hence this species which belongs
    to D might be placed in C

    In Bal glandula in D the parietes of the compartments without
    several were examined might be thought to be solid and therefore
    this species might be wrongly placed in F on the other hand the
    fossil B unguiformis in F often has porose parietes and such
    specimens would naturally be placed in D Lastly without care B
    flosculus might be thought to have a membranous basis and so get
    placed in E

    The genus Pachylasma without an examination of the animals body
    might easily get misplaced in the wrong genus amongst the species
    in the last section F of Balanus yet there can be no doubt that
    Pachylasma belongs to the Chthamalin

  General RemarksThis the first species of Balanus is perhaps
  with the exception of B amphitrite the most difficult and
  variable in the genus There are some other species which vary quite
  as much in external appearance for instance B perforatus but
  B tintinnabulum also varies in far more important points as in
  the proportions and structure of the opercular valves The difficulty
  in determining whether or not the differences are specific is
  wonderfully increased by whole groups of individuals varying in
  exactly the same manner I have seen three most distinct varieties
  taken from the bottom of the same vessel so that I did not at first
  entertain the least doubt that they were three distinct species I
  may mention as showing the vacillations which I have experienced
  on this subject that beginning with the impression that the above
  three varieties were really distinct species after going over the
  several immense collections of specimens placed at my disposal
  I came to the conclusion that the above three and several other
  forms presently to be described were only varieties yet after an
  interval of some months having to look at some of these specimens
  again I could not but think that I had come to a false conclusion
  and so went into all the details again and satisfied myself that I
  had followed a right course after another interval I had to repeat
  the same process and even now I can never look at a group of the
  beautifully coloured shells with their small rounded orifices of
  var coccopoma attached to the Avicula margaritifera or again
  at var dOrbignii with its toothed orifice and white tips to
  the compartments without thinking that they must be specifically
  distinct from the dullcoloured specimens with large entire orifices
  so common on ships bottoms yet I can produce a full series of
  intermediate forms and I can further show in each variety that
  the several points of difference by which each is characterised are
  variable I may be permitted to add in order to show that it has
  not been from indolence that I have combined so many forms that I
  had named and already written out full descriptions of most of the
  varieties before determining to sacrifice them

  Seeing that B tintinnabulum and amphitrite are the two most
  variable species in the genus more especially in the important
  characters derived from the opercular valves and knowing that these
  species are attached so very frequently to ships bottoms one is led
  to suspect that their extreme tendency to vary may be due to their
  being exposed to varying and peculiar conditions whilst transported
  to new and distant localities It is even just possible as may be
  inferred from the facts given in the Introduction p  in regard
  to certain monstrous specimens of Bal balanoides having been
  apparently impregnated by adjoining individuals that the varieties
  may interbreed and so produce numerous intermediate forms Whether
  or not this could take place I am inclined to look at these two
  species as in an almost analogous condition with our domestic
  animals which give rise to such infinitely numerous varieties It
  appears to me probable that several of the varieties keep true
  to their peculiarities as long as they continue to breed in the
  same locality but that when their larv become attached to ships
  bottoms and are thus transported and exposed to new conditions they
  give rise to new and evervarying varieties I will first give a full
  description of the more common forms of B tintinnabulum which
  undoubtedly belong to the same species only alluding to the less
  frequent points of difference and then separately describe the more
  marked varieties

  General AppearanceShape of shell generally tubuloconical or
  conical or globuloconical rarely depressed Orifice either large
  and roundedtrigonal or small and oval either entire or less
  frequently toothed Surface quite smooth or longitudinally ribbed
  ribs of variable strength not unfrequently flexuous or branching
  sometimes roughened with blunt or sharp projecting irregular points
  or more rarely with almost cylindrical upturned long spines the
  simple longitudinal ribs are generally most strongly marked in
  young specimens Colour generally varying from pink to pink
  tinged with purple to dark inky purple more or less striped
  longitudinally with white or pale tints rarely the shell is of the
  brightest rosecolour either uniform or longitudinally striped
  sometimes it is pale purplish or dark blue and sometimes dark
  chocolatepurple the ribs when present are generally more or less
  white sometimes snowwhite That there is much variation in colour
  and in the prominence of the longitudinal ribs is quite certain
  as the two sides of the same individual sometimes differ greatly in
  these respects The radii are generally rather darker coloured than
  the parietes but sometimes they are lighter even in the darkest
  tinged specimens The surfaces of the radii are occasionally finely
  plaited in lines parallel to the basis In some infrequent varieties
  the radii have oblique summits making the orifice of the shell to
  be toothed The sheath is generally feebly coloured but sometimes
  bright chesnutbrown and sometimes blueish The strength of the
  shell varies considerably some of the globuloconical varieties are
  extremely massive Size basal diameter of largest specimen very
  nearly three inches height of the highest specimen three inches

  Young specimens are apt to have a peculiar aspect for their shell
  is often strongly ribbed longitudinally and the summits of their
  radii are sometimes oblique Their scuta are sometimes deeply
  pitted in radiating lines Their colours are generally pale I
  have seen specimens attached to kelp from the Cape of Good Hope
  with their parietes white and ribbed and their radii mottled with
  pinkishpurple I have seen other young specimens from the Galapagos
  Archipelago of a uniform grayishblue

  The Scuta generally have their lines of growth moderately
  prominent occasionally they are longitudinally striated with the
  lines of growth flexuous and upturned at intervals into small
  sharp hoodliked projections which are symmetrically arranged in
  straight lines radiating from the apex of the valve I have seen
  this structure in some specimens of var crispatus and in var
  occator Pl  fig  b and I have noticed an intermediate
  state in var communis The degree to which the basitergal corner
  of the valve is rounded off varies much even in var communis Pl
   fig  a  d  e The articular ridge  c  e
  is broad and much reflexed and often but not always distinctly
  hooked  f The adductor ridge is confluent with the articular
  ridge and runs straight down the valve bounding the cavity for
  the depressor muscle generally the adductor ridge is blunt and so
  little prominent as barely to deserve notice but I have seen it
  sharp and prominent in one specimen of var communis and it is
  generally prominent in var coccopoma  f and most remarkably
  so in var concinnus  g The cavity for the lateral depressor
  muscle is generally very slight but in the two vars just mentioned
  and sometimes in var communis it is deep In var concinnus 
  g there is a remarkable plate developed for the attachment of the
  rostral depressor muscle The scuta are coloured either dullpurple
  or reddish or striped longitudinally white and blue The surface is
  sometimes externally depressed in the line of the adductor ridge and
  in young specimens there is sometimes along this line a chain of
  pits  h as in fullgrown specimens of B trigonus and lvis

  The Tergum Pl  figs  i to  o is broad with a generally
  closed longitudinal furrow this furrow is open in young specimens
  and it is often but not always open in rather large specimens of
  var occator it is always open in var dOrbignii Pl  fig 
  m and sometimes in var concinnus Apex barely beaked except
  in var spinosus in which it is sensibly produced Spur placed
  either very nearly in the middle of the basal margin or when least
  medial it stands at above its own width from the basiscutal angle
  yet in some specimens of var occator the spur is less than its own
  width from this angle The basal margin  i on opposite sides of
  the spur either forms a nearly straight line or the scutal portion
  descends lower than the carinal portion and curves very regularly
  towards the spur this is the case in var dOrbignii  n and
  in some specimens of var occator The carinal half of the basal
  margin generally forms an angle with the spur of only a little above
  a rectangle The spur varies a little in length and breadth but
  never exceeds one fourth of the greatest breadth of the valve The
  scutal margin is broadly inflected the inflected portion forming
  either a right angle or somewhat less than a right angle with the
  exterior surface of the valve Internally the articular ridge is
  prominent and is either considerably or slightly curved it extends
  down either about half or three fourths of the length of the valve
  The spur is produced for a considerable distance up the internal
  surface of the valve as a prominence The crests for the tergal
  depressor muscle are very feeble In one specimen in which both the
  shell and operculum had undergone much disintegration the scuta and
  terga were calcified together

  Compartments their exterior appearance has been already described
  The parietal tubes are not large they are generally crossed by
  transverse septa in their uppermost part but they are sometimes
  almost solidly filled up by dark shelly layers The internal surface
  of the parietes is more or less plainly ribbed in old specimens
  however it generally becomes smooth The radii have their septa
  denticulated on both sides and they are porose that is the
  interspaces between the septa are not filled up solidly The radii
  generally extend from tip to tip of the adjoining compartments that
  is their summits are parallel to the basis but in three not common
  varieties viz vars intermedius occator and dOrbignii
  the former of which at least must without the smallest doubt
  be ranked as a mere variety their summits are oblique I have
  occasionally met with specimens of var communis with oblique
  radii and this is not very infrequent in young shells Exteriorly
  the radii are generally smooth but sometimes finely ribbed
  horizontally owing to the projection of the septa The al have
  their sutural edges smooth their summits are usually parallel to
  the basis but they are often much broken in var zebra however
  in every specimen which I examined the summits were oblique The
  sheath varies much in colour in var occator and in a less
  degree in var intermedius and var dOrbignii the portion
  lining the rostrum and lateral compartments is much darker than
  the other parts of the sheath The Basis generally has a thick
  underlying cancellated layer Sometimes the basis Pl  fig b
  is irregularly cupformed

  Mouth labrum with four or six minute teeth mandibles with five
  graduated teeth inferior point more or less spinose Maxill either
  with or without a small notch beneath the upper pair of spines in
  the lower part there are two spines longer than those immediately
  above them Cirri the first pair has the rami unequal in the
  proportion of about  segments in the longer ramus to  in the
  shorter The segments in the latter have their anterior surfaces very
  protuberant The second pair is short with the anterior surfaces of
  the segments protuberant On the thorax Pl  fig  on each
  side at the bases of third pair of cirri there is a projecting
  membranous plate fringed with fine bristles The three posterior
  pairs have their segments shieldshaped in front generally bearing
  four pairs of spines of which the lower pair is minute between
  these pairs there are some minute spines In some young specimens
  from the Cape of Good Hope and in var concinnus I found six
  pairs of spines on the segments of the posterior cirri

  Geographical DistributionThis species is extremely common over
  the whole of the warmer seas It ranges from the Island of Madeira
  to the Cape of Good Hope and on the west coast of America from
  Monterey in lat  N in California to Peru It is attached to
  rocks and sublittoral shells to floating timber to kelp and to
  Lepas anatifera It is attached in wonderful numbers to ships
  bottoms arriving at our ports from West Africa the West Indies
  the East Indian Archipelago and China It is generally associated
  with B amphitrite and amaryllis I have already stated that
  on the bottoms of vessels the different varieties are generally
  grouped together and this makes me believe that they are local In
  Mr Stutchburys collection there are numerous specimens taken from
  a ship which first went to the west coast of Africa for guano and
  then to Patagonia for the same object and it was interesting to see
  the manner in which numbers of B psittacus a Patagonian species
  had become attached on the African B tintinnabulum The varieties
  from the west coast of America seem eminently peculiar we there find
  var coccopoma and concinnus and a blueish rugged variety with
  peculiar opercular valves

  Geological HistoryI have seen specimens in Mr S Woods
  collection from the Red Crag of England which though not
  accompanied by opercular valves I cannot doubt belong to this
  species The specimens named by Mr Sowerby in the Mineral
  Conchology as B crassus and which I have seen through the
  kindness of Mr J de C Sowerby also belong to this species I
  further believe that a specimen in Sir C Lyells collection given
  to him by M Dujardin under the name of B fasciatus from Touraine
  is likewise B tintinnabulum


Varieties

  With respect to var communis I have nothing to remark The
  second var vesiculosus Pl  fig  h is confined to young
  specimens and may perhaps be due to a want of calcareous matter
  With respect to var validus Pl  figs  c  f infra
  I may observe that some of the coarsest and strongest specimens
  which I have seen were said to have been attached to a surface of
  iron I have seen two large lots of var zebra  g taken by
  Mr Stutchbury from the bottoms of ships arriving from Bengal and
  China and in both cases associated with var communis and in one
  case with var coccopoma I at first thought that this variety
  zebra was specifically distinct but now I feel no doubt that it
  is a mere variety its body was in every respect identical with that
  of var communis

  Nor have I any doubt that var crispatus of Schrter Pl  fig
  h is only a variety although the scuta in some specimens have a
  peculiar appearance externally like these valves in var occator
  Pl  fig  b the scutum is here broader and flatter than in
  var communis and the adductor ridge is very feebly developed
  but we shall see how variable this ridge is in all the varieties
  externally the sharp hoodlike points formed by the upturned lines
  of growth have a very remarkable appearance from being arranged in
  quite straight radiating lines This structure is evidently caused by
  the same tendency which produces on the walls the sharp upturned
  irregular points but it is singular that the scuta are smooth in
  some specimens with very rough parietes and on the other hand
  bristling with the symmetrically arranged hoodlike projections in
  other specimens on which I could with difficulty detect only a few
  exceedingly minute points on the walls In var communis I have
  seen a few specimens with a slight tendency in the scuta to become
  striated longitudinally The tergum in var crispatus presents no
  difference from that in var communis Some of the roughest and
  best characterised specimens of var crispatus appear to have come
  off coppersheathed vessels

  I believe var spinosus of Gmelin Pl  fig i has been
  correctly considered by me as a variety but I have unfortunately
  seen only one set of specimens with their opercular valves preserved
  these were attached to Lepas anatifera The colour of the shell
  varies from reddishpurple to nearly white the radii are sometimes
  quite white the walls are slightly ribbed The scuta in the above
  specimens externally were smooth the adductor ridge was rather more
  distinct from the articular ridge than in any other variety and the
  terga rather more plainly beaked The tubular upcurved calcareous
  spines sometimes occur only on one side of the shell and often only
  in the lower part These spines are often coloured brighter than
  the walls Their presence cannot be accounted for any more than
  the state of the scuta in the foregoing var crispatus by the
  nature of the surface to which they are attached for I have seen one
  set attached to a large rugged specimen of B tintinnabulum and
  another to the very smooth valves of Lepas anatifera I believe
  that this form is almost always associated with var communis
  which is an argument that it is only a variety

  To var coccopoma Pl  fig d I alluded in my introductory
  remarks as having so strongly the aspect of a distinct species I
  possess a beautiful group with a globuloconical smooth shell of
  the finest rose colour with a rather small rounded orifice These
  specimens were attached mingled with B trigonus to Avicula
  margaritifera from as Mr Cuming believes Panama I can never
  look at this set of specimens without doubting the correctness of the
  determination at which I have arrived In the British Museum there
  are two sets of specimens taken off a vessel on the west coast of
  South America almost identical in external appearance with those in
  my possession but rather more rugged Mr Stutchbury has sent me
  some specimens from a ship direct from China which are rather paler
  pink and more striped and come near to some ordinary varieties of
  B tintinnabulum The scuta Pl  fig  f in the above three
  sets of specimens agree in having the adductor ridge more developed
  and the pit for the lateral depressor muscle deeper than is usual
  The tergum  l  o in most but not in all these specimens
  has a rather broader spur and some of the specimens have the
  carinal portion of the basal margin considerably hollowed out the
  spur also is placed nearer the basiscutal angle than in ordinary
  cases On the other hand in Mr Cumings collection there are two
  specimens taken off a vessel identical in external appearance with
  the foregoing but which have scuta and terga in every character
  exactly as in var communis hence I am compelled to consider all
  these specimens as mere varieties

  Var concinnus Pl  fig e is perhaps the most remarkable
  of all the varieties I have seen three sets of specimens from the
  west coast of South Americaall identical in appearance having
  longitudinallyribbed walls either rosy or of a dull purple striped
  and freckled in a peculiar manner with white I have however
  seen an approach to this colouring in some few specimens of var
  communis and the shell itself offers no other peculiarities The
  scutum Pl  fig  g resembles in general shape that of var
  coccopoma but the adductor ridge is here much sharper and more
  prominent and the rostral depressor muscle instead of being lodged
  in a little cavity formed by the folding over the occludent margin
  has in addition a small plate on the under side which tends to
  convert the pit into a tube The tergum exactly resembles that of
  var communis The segments in the sixth cirrus bear six instead
  of four pairs of spinesa circumstance which I have noticed
  only in some young specimens of var communis from the Cape of
  Good Hope From these several peculiarities until quite lately I
  resolved to keep this form specifically distinct but I have finally
  concluded that they are not sufficient For firstly I have seen a
  scutum in var communis Pl  fig  d with the adductor
  ridge nearly as sharp and this ridge is always strongly pronounced
  in var coccopoma secondly with respect to the plate for the
  rostral depressor muscle although I have not seen this in any other
  variety yet in Bal concavus a closely analogous plate situated
  in the lateral depressor cavity is highly variable and I am not
  willing to found a new species on one minute point of structurea
  structure which is variable in another species of the same genus

  I have seen some cylindrical and conical specimens of B
  tintinnabulum from the coast of Mexico and California only
  noticeable as far as the shell was concerned from being rugged
  and of a dull blueishpurple but which had opercular valves
  exactly like those of var coccopoma and therefore as far as
  the scutum is concerned approaching closely in structure to var
  concinnusall three from the west coast of America Hence I was
  at one time led to believe that there existed a species on this line
  of coast which represented B tintinnabulum and which varied in
  external shape and colour in an analogous manner to that species But
  as the opercular valves in var coccopoma are sometimes identical
  with those of var communis and as this is always the case with
  the tergum of var concinnus and as the shell itself presents
  no differences it is scarcely possible to admit the existence on
  the west coast of America of this supposed representative of B
  tintinnabulum

  With respect to var intermedius I have little to say in addition
  to the character given above I have seen only two groups of
  specimens in Mr Cumings collection the chief interest in this
  variety is that it shows that the next form must be ranked as a
  variety and not as a distinct species

  Of var occator Pl  fig k I have seen several specimens
  mostly taken off the bottoms of vessels and one specimen marked
  in Mr Cumings collection South Seas After having carefully
  examined these specimens I came to the conclusion that the slightly
  oblique radiithe general colouring and more especially that of the
  sheaththe scuta Pl  fig  b with their sharp hoodlike
  points in radiating linesand the terga with the spur so near to
  the basiscutal angle were amply sufficient to distinguish it as
  a good species Subsequently however I found that the scuta in
  var crispatus presented both externally and internally exactly
  the same peculiar appearance In var intermedius I found the
  summits of the radii equally oblique and the general colouring
  nearly the same and more especially a close approach to the singular
  circumstance of the sheath differing in colour towards the opposite
  ends of the shell So that the position of the spur of the tergum was
  the chief remaining character and this evidently varied considerably
  in the four or five specimens examined by me being either its own
  width or much less than its own width from the basiscutal angle
  the outline also of the small portion of basal margin between the
  spur and the basiscutal angle likewise varied much being either
  angularly indented or gradually curved down towards the spur so
  also the tip of the spur varied in shape The longitudinal furrow
  is unusually apt in this variety to remain open We know that the
  position of the spur varies considerably in var communis Hence
  although the spur on an average lies closer to the basiscutal
  angle in this than in any other variety even than in var
  dOrbignii it would I conceive be preposterous to found a species
  on this one character In the animals body every part agrees
  perfectly with that of var communis

  Lastly we come to var dOrbignii Pl  fig l until quite
  recently I did not even suspect that this form was only a variety
  of B tintinnabulum I have examined a great number of specimens
  in Mr Stutchburys collection which had come attached on a vessel
  from Java and likewise a few other specimens in other collections
  They all closely resemble each other in shape and even in size
  and differ only in tint of colour and in the surface being either
  very smooth or longitudinally ribbed sometimes with rugged sharp
  points From this circumstancefrom the peculiarity of the tint
  with the tips of the parietes and one side of the radii perfectly
  whiteand from the obliquity of the summits of the radii I was led
  to think this form specifically distinct But the colour does not
  differ from that of some other varieties of B tintinnabulum the
  circumstance of the colour being uniform or not striped is common
  to the subvarieties of several varieties and the white tips to
  the parietes and the white borders to the radii result simply
  from the shell whilst young having been wholly white and this is
  not rarely the case with var communis Dismissing therefore
  colour it will be found that hardly any other characters remain by
  which this form can be separated from var occator in both the
  summits of the radii are oblique in both the sheath is coloured in
  nearly the same manner in both the opercular valves especially the
  terga Pl  figs  m  n resemble each other the scuta
  however are smooth in var dOrbignii and rough in var occator
  This latter form certainly cannot be specifically separated from
  var intermedius and this assuredly is only a variety of B
  tintinnabulum Hence I am led to conclude that Balanus dOrbignii
  of Chenu peculiar as its whole aspect is must be ranked only as a
  variety of B tintinnabulum its oblique radii resulting from the
  same cause whatever that may be which has given this structure
  to var intermedius and occator and its peculiar colouring to
  having been exposed owing probably to having been transported on
  vessels to different conditions whilst young and old

    was first used But as Ellis himself did not then know of or
    follow this method it might be disputed whether according to the
    spirit of the law his name ought to stand The only other name
    given to this species is that of tulipa affixed by Poli in 
    but this name had been previously used by Mller in  and by
    Chemnitz in  for another species the B Hameri of this
    work and likewise also previously to Poli by Bruguire in 
    for still another species viz B tintinnabulum of this work
    under these complicated causes of confusion I think it is highly
    advisable to adopt Elliss name I may add that the B tulipa of
    Mr G B Sowerby is the B tintinnabulum of this work It is
    possible that the B conoides of Brown Illustrations Conch
    st edit pl  fig  may be our present species but without
    details of structure it is hardly possible to identify in many
    cases the species of Balanus

Shell dark rosecoloured sometimes tinged with purple orifice
toothed Scutum externally very smooth covered by membrane Tergum
with distinct crests for the depressor muscles

  HabSicily Malta Malaga associated with B perforatus
  Madeira Often growing in clusters and associated with Pachylasma
  giganteum Attached to Millepora aspera oysters and other
  shells According to Poli an inhabitant of deep water yet in mus
  Cuming there are two fine specimens attached to the always floating
  Lepas anatifera Mus Lowe Macandrew Stutchbury


  General AppearanceShell tubuloconical or conical orifice
  large toothed approaching to pentagonal Surface moderately smooth
  naked Colour rosy or tilered with a slight tinge of purple or
  beautiful rich purple Radii nearly as dark as or darker than the
  parietes The portion of the al seen externally is generally white
  Internally the whole shell is nearly white Generally the tints
  outside vary in transverse fasci sometimes there are very fine
  dark longitudinal lines Largest specimen from Malta  of an
  inch in basal diameter usually fullsized specimens are about three
  quarters of an inch in basal diameter

  Scuta Pl  fig  a  c very smooth with the
  growthridges very little prominent sometimes there are obscure
  traces of longitudinal stri surface covered by an unusually thick
  and persistent yellow membrane valve narrow with the upper part
  commonly reflexed the basal margin forms with the occludent margin
  a smaller angle than is usual the tergal margin of the valve is
  rectangularly inflected instead of being as is usual merely
  bowed inwards Internally the articular ridge is rather prominent
  The depth of the slight pit for the lateral depressor muscle is
  variable it sometimes includes a minute central longitudinal ridge

  Terga  b  d the longitudinal furrow is deep with the
  sides folded in the spur is placed at about its own width from
  the basiscutal angle it is moderately long with its lower end
  obliquely rounded off but the length breadth and precise outline
  of the lower end varies a little The basal margin on the opposite
  sides of the spur forms a nearly straight line but with the
  portion on the carinal side very slightly hollowed out Crests for
  the depressor muscle are well developed

  CompartmentsThe radii and al always have their summits oblique
  the sutural edges of the radii are deeply penetrated by pores between
  the strongly denticulated septa the sutural edges of the al are
  quite smooth the tubes in the parietes are crossed in the upper
  part of the shell by septa Basis tubular with an underlying
  cancellated mass

  MouthLabrum with the teeth either absent or very small
  mandibles with the fourth and fifth teeth rudimentary maxill with
  a small notch under the two upper spines near the lower angle
  two spines one beneath the other are larger even than the upper
  pair beneath the lower pair there is a tuft of fine spines
  Cirri segments protuberant in one ramus of the first cirrus and
  in both rami of the second cirrus posterior cirri with the segments
  short and broad each bearing three pairs of spines with a small
  intermediate tuft

  AffinitiesThis species in all essential respects comes very near
  to the three last varieties of B tintinnabulum which have the
  orifices of their shells toothed The smoothness of the scutum with
  its persistent epidermisits peculiar shapeits small and not
  reflexed articular ridgetogether with the crests on the tergum for
  the depressor muscles are sufficient diagnostic characters Even in
  general habit and tint of colour this species has a different aspect
  from B tintinnabulum In some respects B tulipiformis leads
  into the species included in the third section of the genus

forming a tubular cavity which extends up to the apex of the valve
Tergum with the apex produced needlelike purple spur placed at less
than its own width from the basiscutal angle

  HabPeru Chile Chiloe Patagonia Fossil in an ancient tertiary
  deposit Coquimbo and in a superficial recent bed at S Josef in
  Patagonia


  General appearanceShell either almost cylindrical or steeply
  conical generally fleshcoloured sometimes pale pink surface
  either smooth when not disintegrated or sometimes with the parietes
  distinctly and rather strongly ribbed with the ribs distant from
  each other I have seen six or seven ribs on the rostrum alone The
  orifice in the most perfect specimens is nearly equilateral and
  hexagonal The radii generally are very broad but occasionally
  quite narrow and even linear The basis is generally deeply and
  irregularly cupformed

  SizeThis is the largest species in the family I have seen a
  specimen six inches in length and three and a half in diameter and
  another specimen no less than nine in length though only two and a
  half inches in diameter

  ScutaIn fullsized specimens the surface is finely striated
  longitudinally caused by the lines of growth being minutely sinuous
  but in young specimens until they attain a basal diameter of above
  half an inch the surface is smooth The valve is transversely
  arched a line of flexure running from the apex to the basal margin
  at about one third of the width of the valve from the tergal margin
  The basal margin is curved nearly continuously and extends nearly
  halfway up the valve hence the basitergal corner is largely
  rounded off The articular ridge is but little prominent and is not
  reflexed the articular furrow is very narrow The adductor ridge
  consists of a sharp muchprojecting plate running down close to the
  basal margin and is confluent with the lower part of the articular
  ridge This plate and the inflected tergal margin of the valve
  together form a large and deep cavity which extends up almost to the
  apex of the valve The depressor muscle is attached in the middle at
  the lower open end of this cavity

  TergaThese are strongly beaked the beak being from one third
  to one fourth of the total length of the valve including the spur
  the beak is very sharp somewhat flattened and bowed when young
  and when well preserved it is coloured purple it is penetrated
  by a fine tubular cavity occupied by a thread of corium which
  extends about halfway up it The whole valve is narrow being about
  thrice as long as wide The spur is also long and narrow it is
  seated at less than its own width from the basiscutal angle The
  scutal margin is not much inflected The longitudinal furrow has its
  sides in fullgrown specimens closely folded together The basal
  margin slopes down on both sides to the spur There are no crests
  or only traces of them for the attachment of the depressor muscle
  Internally the spur is prolonged as a prominent ridge upwards to
  the beak and serves as an articular ridge In the middle in the
  upper part Pl  fig  d between this articular ridge and the
  carinal margin there is a second narrow ridge which extends from
  the lower part of the beak halfway down the valve and then dies
  out The space between these two ridges and the ridges themselves
  are coloured purple and consist of harder shell than the rest of
  the valve hence when the outer surface and the adjoining scutal and
  carinal margins disintegrate this part remains and so forms the
  beaked purple apex

  CompartmentsThe parietal tubes are unusually large in proportion
  to the size of the shell and run up to the summit without any
  transverse septa the longitudinal septa are strongly denticulated
  The radii are penetrated by large tubes their septa are very
  strongly denticulated and the denticuli themselves often subdivide
  and branch out at their extremities The sutural edges of the al
  are smooth or with a high power can just be seen to be crenated
  The radii are generally very highly developed so that their summits
  are even wider than the bases of the parietes but on the other
  hand in some few large specimens the radii are either very narrow
  or absolutely linear In these latter cases the diametric growth
  has nearly or altogether ceased whilst the walls of the shell have
  continued to be added to at their bases their summits at the same
  time suffering disintegration and thus the orifice has increased in
  size

  Basis generally and occasionally very deeply cupformed An
  unusually thick cancellated layer in most cases forms the under side
  of the basis

  MouthLabrum apparently without teeth or with very minute ones
  mandibles with three teeth of which the third is thicker than the
  first or upper one the fourth and fifth teeth are confluent with the
  inferior angle The maxill have a small notch under the upper pair
  of spines inferior part projecting and supporting two spines placed
  one below the other and equalling in size the upper pair Cirri
  the rami of the first cirrus are unequal by four or five segments
  shorter ramus and both rami of the second cirrus with the segments
  extremely protuberant posterior cirri not much elongated with the
  segments rather broad supporting six pairs of spines

  General RemarksThis which is much the largest known species
  of the genus ranges from Peru Arica being the most northern spot
  whence I have seen specimens along the coast of Chile where it
  is very abundant at a few fathoms depth at least as far south as
  Southern Chiloe it is said by Captain King to attain the largest
  size at Conception On the coast of Eastern Patagonia I dredged
  up this species from nineteen fathoms in lat  In lat 
  S Josef on the same eastern coast I found fossil specimens
  in beds of sand upraised between eighty and one hundred feet In
  the tertiary formation at Coquimbo in Chile it occurs in the
  middle bed associated with the recent B lvis and with various
  mollusca all of which are apparently extinct indicating that the
  formation is of considerable antiquity In the living state on
  the coast of Chile it is often associated with B lvis As it
  frequently adheres to large specimens of the Concholepas it must
  sometimes be an inhabitant of shallow water I have seen one specimen
  attached to Mytilus Magellanicus Mr Cuming believes that about
  six fathoms is the usual depth at which it lives Numerous specimens
  are often congregated together into great masses Mr Stutchbury has
  some interesting specimens which he procured from a ship that had
  first sailed to Ichaboe on the coast of Africa and afterwards
  to Patagonia consequently numerous specimens of B psittacus
  had become attached on B tintinnabulum and subsequently during
  the voyage home some few of the latter again had adhered on B
  psittacus the contrast in the paler colour and hexagonal orifice
  of this species with the darker tints and more trigonal orifice of
  B tintinnabulum was striking At Coquimbo in Chile I procured
  a specimen of B psittacus attached to a chain cable which had
  been in the water only six months this specimen measured  of an
  inch in basal diameter and  in height this shows a rapid rate of
  growth Lastly I may mention that it is asserted by Molina and I am
  assured by Mr Cuming that the statement is perfectly correct that
  this Balanus when cooked is universally esteemed as a delicious
  article of food

  This species comes extremely close to the South American B
  psittacus and I should hardly have attached a specific name to
  it had I not examined many specimens young and old of the true
  B psittacus from Peru Chile and Eastern Patagonia and found
  them all identical in the few apparently trifling points in
  which that species differs from B capensis The animals body
  and the shell agree in every respect excepting that the shell is
  decidedly pinker being often most distinctly and prettily striped
  longitudinally with pale and bright pink In some of the specimens
  the basis is cupformed in some the broad radii are pale pink
  in others they are quite white and in this latter case a singular
  aspect is given to the pinkish varieties In very large specimens
  and I have seen one fully two inches in basal diameter the pink
  colour is extremely feeble and the whole shell has a very rugged
  disintegrated coarse and sometimes dirty appearance in most
  of these large specimens the walls are more massive than in B
  psittacus and the orifice of the shell rather smaller in some
  however the walls certainly are of unusual thinness

  The Scuta differ from those of B psittacus only in the
  basitergal corner not being so much rounded off and consequently
  in the articular ridge which is rather more reflexed descending in
  proportion lower down the valve the cavity at the basitergal corner
  is in proportion broader The valves in the two species differ also
  but only in young specimens in the occludent half being tinted
  both externally and internally purple whereas in B psittacus
  the whole valve at all ages is white In the terga the spur is
  removed fully its own width from the basiscutal angle whereas it
  is not half this distance in B psittacus The scutal margin is
  here much more inflected In B psittacus there is a remarkable
  patch of purple on the inside of the valve between the articular
  ridge and a second special ridge of this purple patch there is here
  no trace consequently the beak or apex is white The beak also is
  less prominent The special ridge just alluded to here runs much
  nearer to the articular ridge and is less prominent indeed in old
  specimens it is often almost obliterated Finally the whole valve
  in proportion to the Scutum is rather broader

  I have seen a young specimen about a quarter of an inch in basal
  diameter with the orifice of the shell toothed owing to the
  obliquity of the summits of the radii and this gave the shell a very
  peculiar aspect The largest wellcoloured specimen which I have seen
  is  of an inch in basal diameter but in Mr Cumings collection
  there are two rugged disintegrated specimens two inches in basal
  diameter and two and a half in height Some specimens  in basal
  diameter in Mr Stutchburys collection are remarkable from the
  radii having been obliteratedthe shell being merely divided by six
  sutures as we have seen is likewise sometimes the case with large
  specimens of B psittacus

  This species is evidently a South African representative of the South
  American B psittacus

There can be no doubt that this species is the B nigrescens in
Chenu who had access to Lamarcks original specimens and there can be
equally little doubt that it is the B gigas of Ranzani collected
during Baudins expedition at King Georges Sound it is essentially
allied to B psittacus but in external appearance strikingly
resembles some of the varieties of B tintinnabulum


  General AppearanceShape tubuloconical walls smooth sometimes
  longitudinally ribbed colour ashygray tinged with blue but many
  specimens are dark purplishblue owing to the disintegration of the
  outer lamina and consequent exposure of the almost solidly filled
  up dark blueish parietal tubes on the other hand some specimens
  are quite white Ranzani describes the colour as earthyviolet which
  is very characteristic of some of the specimens The orifice is apt
  to be rather small compared to the size of the specimens and tends
  to be hexagonal The radii are often rather narrow The opercular
  valves are tinted pale blue The basal diameter of the largest
  specimen is two inches and its height two and a quarter

  The Scuta have their basitergal corner much rounded off as in
  B psittacus so that the tergal margin does not extend more than
  half down the valve The surface is somewhat prominent along a line
  running from the apex to the point of chief curvature in the basal
  margin The surface is not striated Internally the articular ridge
  is little prominent and not reflexed the lower end depends as a
  free sharp style or point The adductor ridge is moderately sharp
  and stands some little way distant from the articular ridge it is
  produced downwards and forms a moderately deep and large cavity for
  the depressor muscle but this cavity is not closed and does not
  extend up as in the two last species to the apex of the valve

  Terga narrow with a sharp prominent needlelike beak Spur
  long narrow placed at less than its own width from the basiscutal
  angle the basal margin on both sides slopes down to the spur the
  scutal margin is not inflected Internally the articular ridge is
  very feebly developed but extends down close to the basiscutal
  angle On the under surface in the upper part of the valve there is
  a short very slight ridge extending on the carinal side near and
  parallel to the articular ridge this slight ridge plays an important
  part as in the two foregoing species in the formation of the beak
  or apex Crests for the depressor muscle are hardly distinguishable

  The Walls appear to vary in some degree in strength and thickness
  as is likewise the case with the opercular valves In some of the
  thinner specimens the parietal tubes are large and the longitudinal
  septa are furnished with small sharp denticula The tubes are often
  thickly lined or almost filled up solidly with blue shell they are
  not crossed by transverse septa

  The Radii vary in width externally they are often finely ribbed
  transversely at other times they are smooth their septa are fine
  and thin with their delicate denticuli not extending to the outer
  lamina they are very porose The al have their summits parallel
  to the basis their sutural edges are most finely crenated The

  distinguished by colour and by the inner lamina of the parietes not
  being cancellated

Scutum finely striated longitudinally Tergum with the longitudinal
furrow shallow and open basal margin on both sides sloping towards the

  HabWest Coast of South America Mus Cuming


  General AppearanceShell conical with a large rhomboidal
  orifice walls rather thin coloured together with the radii and
  operculum dark purplishbrown sheath nearly colourless Walls
  smooth slightly irregular very finely striated longitudinally
  Basal diameter of largest specimen  of an inch

  Opercular Valves unusually smooth that is without prominent
  growthridges Scuta finely striated longitudinally with the
  sharp stri closely approximate The teeth on the occludent margin
  are sharp and stand some way apart from each other Internally the
  whole surface is remarkably flat and smooth the articular ridge is
  of moderate breadth and slightly reflexed there is no adductor
  ridge and the oval depression for the lateral depressor muscle is
  extremely slight Terga with the longitudinal furrow very slight
  the bottom of this furrow is feebly striated longitudinally and
  there is a trace of a fine rounded ridge on the scutal margin as in
  B decorus The basal margin slopes on both sides towards the spur
  which is of moderate length and breadth with its lower end truncated
  and parallel to the carinobasal margin the spur stands at about
  once and a half its own width from the basiscutal angle Internally
  the valve is lined by very dark purplishbrown corium the articular
  ridge is prominent in the upper part of the valve parallel to the
  articular ridge there are two or three feeble ridges there are no
  crests for the tergal depressores

  The Parietes though moderately thick yet are light and fragile
  the denticuli at the bases of the longitudinal septa are prominent
  and those on the adjoining septa are united together making a
  network Pl  fig  d but the interspaces between them are not
  filled up by solid calcareous matter as is the case with every other
  species of the genus but are only crossed at successive levels by
  fine transverse calcareous septa the internal lamina thus becoming
  cancellated and though thick fragile Hence in a transverse
  section of the parietes the ordinary parietal tubes or pores are
  seen to be lined on their inner sides by five or six rows of very
  minute pores I have not seen any other instance of this structure
  The internal lamina is ribbed as usual on its inner surface by
  the projection of the longitudinal septa The ordinary parietal
  tubes are open to nearly the summit of the shell The radii are
  rather thin and unusually fragile their summits are parallel to
  the basis their septa as seen on the sutural edges are extremely
  thin and denticulated on both their upper and lower surfaces on the
  side towards the internal lamina towards the external lamina the
  septa are simple and the small square pores thus formed are open
  or not filled up The al have their summits extremely oblique
  being added to very little during the diametric growth of the shell
  the narrow margin however which is thus added is coloured red
  the rest of the sheath being nearly colourless the sutural edges
  of the al are smooth The basis has a thick underlying finely
  cancellated layer of shell

  Animals body unknown

  A young specimen  of an inch in basal diameter differed from
  the above in being of a much paler purplishbrown This species is
  distinct from all its congeners in its peculiar colour and likewise
  in the structure of the inner lamina of the parietes As already
  stated it comes nearer to B decorus than to any other species

  Mus Cuming Mus Brit and Stutchbury


  General AppearanceShell globuloconvex sometimes much elongated
  in its rostrocarinal axis smooth walls excessively strong
  massive and heavy Orifice oval rather small in proportion to the
  size of shell this being chiefly due to the infolding of the upper
  part of the rostral compartment Parietes pale pink feebly tinted
  with purple radii either paler or tinted of a bright chesnutbrown
  sheath rich purplish chesnutbrown Basal diameter of the largest
  specimen nearly  of an inch height  another specimen had
  a basal longitudinal diameter of  of an inch and a transverse
  diameter of only  this great difference in the two diameters
  being caused by the prolongation of the basal portion of the rostrum
  in the line of the branch of the Millepora to which the shell had
  adhered the height of this same specimen was  and the diameter
  of the orifice both transversely and longitudinally  of an inch

  Scuta broad feebly tinted with pink exterior surface rough
  with sharp hoodformed projections arranged in straight lines
  radiating from the apex an inflected portion of the valve along the
  tergal margin is not roughened Internally Pl  fig  d the
  articular ridge is broad and reflexed An adductor ridge can hardly
  be said to exist but a slight prominence borders the gentle hollow
  in which the lateral depressor muscle is attached The basal margin
  on its inner face is slightly toothed Tergum white with the
  narrow part of the valve on the scutal side of the spur rough with
  the little projecting hoods like those on the scutum the other and
  larger half is smooth spur rather long narrow placed at twice its
  own width from the basiscutal angle on the carinal side about half
  of the basal margin slopes down towards the spur The longitudinal
  furrow is either quite or nearly closed Internally the spur is
  produced upwards on the valve as a prominence the articular ridge
  is not very prominent There are no crests for the tergal depressor
  muscle

  Altogether the opercular valves strikingly resemble those of B
  tintinnabulum but all the characters above mentioned have not been
  observed in any one variety of this species perhaps var coccopoma
  comes nearest both in the external appearance of the shell and in
  the structure of the opercular valves to B Ajax

  The Compartments are remarkably compact and solid the parietal
  tubes are cylindrical and quite minute even close to the basis they
  extend however nearly up to the top of the shell the parietal
  septa at the basis are thick and with blunt denticuli the thickness
  of the walls in the upper part of the shell is excessive in the
  lower part it is also unusually great owing to the thickness of the
  inner lamina and hence the ribs generally formed by the projection
  of the longitudinal septa on the inner lamina are here visible only
  close to the basis The radii are rather wide their summits are
  parallel to the basis the septa on their sutural edges are thin
  straight and closely approximate and most symmetrically furnished
  with little denticuli of equal sizes on both sides the interspaces
  are nearly filled up solidly but with some pores still left open
  In the upper part of the shell the radii like the walls are of
  extraordinary thickness the septa are transverse and horizontal
  as seen externally by slight variations in the colour of the radii
  internally as seen in a vertical section of the shell the septa
  dip inwards at an angle of above  The al are thin and have
  their summits oblique their sutural edges are smooth The pores in
  the basis are crossed by numerous transverse septa and there is an
  underlying cancellated layer the internal surface is very smooth

  Animals body unknown

  The strength of this Balanus is truly remarkable and when by
  repeated blows a specimen which I was examining at last yielded
  the radii broke sooner than separate at their sutures In most of
  its characters this species approaches B tintinnabulum and I
  believe has been included by Chenu as one of its varieties but
  it comes almost equally near to B stultus to which it is much
  more closely allied in its habit of being attached to Millepor
  By a close and unbroken chain of affinities B Ajax through B
  stultus is connected with B calceolus and its allies in section
  B which live attached to Gorgoni Some of the specimens of B
  Ajax are almost as much elongated in their rostrocarinal axis as
  are the species in section B and there is an affinity in the same
  direction in the smallness of the pores in the radii of B Ajax
  indeed had the basis in this species been generally more boator
  cupformed I should have placed it as the first species in section
  B instead of as at present the last species in section A The
  intermediateness of the characters of B Ajax has been one chief
  cause why I have rejected the genus Conopea which was instituted by
  Say for the species living attached to Gorgoni

  HabAttached to Millepor Singapore Mus Cuming West
  Indies Mus BritMus Stutchbury

     This specimen in the British Museum was purchased at the sale
    of the Rev L Guildings collection and therefore it is not
    certain that this habitat is correct but as it was sold in the
    same lot with a Cirripede certainly West Indian and as the main
    collection was made in the West Indies this habitat may I think
    be trusted


I have considerable doubts whether it would not have been more correct
to have placed this species in the last section instead of where
it now stands it certainly is more closely allied to B Ajax
especially in its operculum than to the following species yet the
fact of the radii not being permeated by pores does not permit of its
admission into the last section and both in habits and structure it
undoubtedly comes very near to the following species Those varieties
which are not much elongated and which have the basis nearly flat
would certainly if considered by themselves alone not have gained
admission into our present section

  elongated in the rostrocarinal axis owing to the basal production
  of the rostrum Orifice rather small entire oval pointed at the
  carinal end Radii moderately broad with their summits parallel to
  the basis Colour dirty white often faintly tinged with purple
  sheath pale purplishblue Surface extremely smooth the parietes
  are generally covered as viewed through a lens by a very thin

I must premise with respect to the nomenclature of this and the three
following quite distinct species that in the published descriptions
no allusion is made to any one of the characters by which alone
they can be distinguished hence I have been guided by geographical
probabilities in assigning the specific name of calceolus to the
present species as Elliss specimens came from the Mediterranean and
that of galeatus to the North American and West Indian specimens as
Linnus original specimens according to a statement by Spengler came
from the West Indies I have assigned new names to the two remaining
East Indian species I may here add that Spengler Skrifter af
Naturhist  B tab  fig   has described under the name of
B cassis an allied form attached to the Gorgonia placomus from
the seas of Norway but I do not believe that it is the same with our
present species


  General AppearanceThe degree of elongation of the shell in
  its rostrocarinal axis varies considerably  a  b the
  elongation is due to the production of the rostrum and of the
  corresponding end of the basal cup These two portions of the
  shell always form together an angle and sometimes an acute angle
  whereas in all the many specimens which I have seen the carina and
  the carinal end or heel of the basis together form a straight
  line yet I should not be surprised if this end of the shell was
  sometimes produced The surface of the shell is smooth or sometimes
  marked with very minute projecting points it is almost always
  covered by the horny bark of the Gorgonia The colour is either dull
  purplishred or dull purple with obscure longitudinal stripes
  and often more or less transversely banded with white The rostrum
  is either white or very feebly tinted being always paler than the
  rest of the shell the radii are usually paler than the parietes
  and are sometimes white the carinal end of the basal cup is tinted
  of the same colour with but rather paler than the compartments
  The orifice is rather small compared to the shell and nearly
  heartshaped The carinolateral compartments are about onethird of
  the width of the lateral compartments The shell is very strong and
  the sutures resist the action of boiling caustic potash The largest
  specimen which I have seen was  of an inch in extreme length and
  under  in extreme breadth

  Structure of the shell and basisThe parietes are permeated by
  quite distinct poresa character sufficient by itself to separate
  this from the following species the longitudinal septa forming the
  tubes are slightly denticulated at their bases The radii have their
  summits quite square extending from apex to apex of the adjoining
  compartments The al have oblique summits The sutural edges of
  the radii have approximate septa which are obscurely denticulated
  the interspaces are filled up solidly so that the radii are not
  porose The basis is distinctly porose by which this species can be
  distinguished from B navicula and cymbiformis The basis has a
  deep furrow on the under side from clasping the thin horny axis of
  the Gorgonia the basal point of the rostrum is also notched from the
  same cause and as a consequence its upper surface becomes slightly
  furrowed along its whole length

  The Scuta have an articular ridge but moderately prominent and
  only slightly reflexed the basitergal corner is rounded off there
  is no adductor ridge there is a small rather deep distinct pit
  for the lateral depressor muscle Terga externally the surface is
  considerably depressed in the line of the spur The spur is between
  half and onethird of the width of the valve its lower end is square
  and truncated or in some degree rounded it is sometimes  e
  dentated with a few minute sharp teeth The articular ridge is but
  slightly developed the crests for the depressor muscle are very
  feeble

     If I have assigned the specific title of galeatus to
    the wrong species yet Says name of elongatus ought not
    strictly to be admitted as the Lepas elongata of Gmelin is a
    Balanusprobably a variety of Balanus crenatus I may add that
    as the Lepas galeata of Schrter Einleitung in die Conch
    c was attached to a Gorgonia from the East Indies it cannot be
    our present species but probably is one of the three other allied
    species which all occur in India

Parietes not porose basis porose Tergum with the apex square
caused by the great development of the articular ridge

  HabCharlestown South Carolina Florida West Indies Central
  America attached to Gorgoni Mus Brit Agassiz Cuming
  Stutchbury


  General AppearanceThis and the two following species come so
  close in general appearance to the last that it will be quite
  superfluous to do more than describe the few points of difference
  The shell and basis are generally quite as much elongated as in the
  last species and sometimes much more so owing to the carinal end
  fig  a with the corresponding portion of the basal cup being
  produced like the rostral end into a flattened sharp point I have
  seen a specimen in this state  of an inch in length and only 
  in breadth in the broadest part In many specimens however the
  shape is exactly as in B calceolus but the rostrum seems less
  usually furrowed from clasping the stem of the Gorgonia The colour
  is paler pinker and more distinctly striped longitudinally than
  in B calceolus I have however seen some notstriped purple
  specimens and one transversely freckled with white from the West
  Indies The parietes are stronglyribbed internally and are not
  permeated by pores The radii have their sutural edges crenated The
  basal cup is permeated by pores

  The Scutum differs from that in the last species only in the pit
  for the lateral depressor muscle being much shallower and less
  defined and in the apex being truncated The Tergum is remarkable
  from its broad square truncated summit which underlies the whole
  broad apex of the scutum the square summit of the tergum is formed
  by a great and peculiar development of the uppermost part of the
  articular ridge The spur is a little narrower than in B calceolus

  Mouth on the crest of the labrum there are two teeth on each side
  of the central notch The mandibles have five teeth of which the two
  lower are very small The maxill show a trace of a notch under the
  upper large pair of spines near the inferior angle there are two
  long spines Cirri in the first pair one ramus is nearly twice as
  long as the other the segments are not very protuberant There is
  a sharp point at the dorsal basis of the penis The branchi are of
  moderate size and plicated on one side

Parietes and basis not porose Scutum and Tergum with very small
articular ridges Tergum broad almost equilateral

  HabAttached to a Gorgonia Tubicoreen near Madras Dr
  Johnston Hab unknown Mus Cuming


  General AppearanceI have seen only two specimens kindly sent me
  by Dr Johnston and a single specimen in Mr Cumings collection
  In most points this species agrees with the two last species The
  shell excepting the rostrum and even the opercular valves in Mr
  Cumings specimen were of a very fine purplishred in the other
  specimens they were feebly tinted purple The parietes are strongly
  ribbed internally and are not permeated by pores The basal cup is
  not porose but its inner surface is ribbed in lines radiating from
  the centre and in both these respects this species differs from the
  two foregoing The Radii are rather narrow they are paler coloured
  than the parietes they have their sutural edges plainly crenated
  The al have extremely oblique summits the narrow rim added during
  the diametric growth of the shell is white the rest of the sheath
  being in Mr Cumings specimen finely coloured like the parietes
  Basal diameter of the longer axis of the largest specimen  of an
  inch

  Scutum rather narrow with the basitergal corner much rounded
  off externally the lines of growth are little prominent Internally
  the articular ridge is extremely little developed and not at all
  reflexed there is no adductor ridge there is a minute pit for the
  lateral depressor muscle placed almost on the edge of the valve
  The Tergum is broad forming the spur being excepted an almost
  equilateral triangle The articular ridge is remarkably little
  prominent and placed close to the scutal margin The spur is nearly
  half as broad as the valve with its extremity or basal margin in one
  case obliquely truncated and in another case nearly square

  HabAttached to Gorgoni Tubicoreen Madras associated with B
  calceolus Dr Johnston Hab unknown Mus Brit and Darwin


This is a very distinct form though nearer to the foregoing than to
the other species Its separation from the subgenus Acasta is quite
artificial its affinity to this subgenus is shown by its weaker
shell nonporose parietes and basis by the radii having their sutural
edges smooth and their summits not quite square by the carinolateral
compartments being very narrow by the less elongated basis not
furrowed from not clasping the branches of the Gorgonia and by the
longitudinally striated scuta nevertheless from the similar habits
and from the graduated structure in the five foregoing species it
cannot be removed out of the genus Balanus I have seen three sets of
specimens of this species


  General AppearanceShell sometimes with the rostrum and
  sometimes with the carina and corresponding portions of the basal
  cup elongated but not apparently to so great a degree as in
  the foregoing species basis not furrowed from not clasping the
  branches of the Gorgonia Colour pale blueishpurple with the
  radii whiter The surface is studded with small calcareous points
  The carinolateral compartments are very narrow not more than one
  tenth of the width of the lateral compartments they are moreover
  scarcely wider at the base than at the summit The summits of the
  radii are apparently a little oblique or at least not so square as
  in the foregoing species The shell is not nearly so strong as in the
  last three species and the compartments separate by gentle force
  and from the action of caustic potash The largest specimen was  of
  an inch in basal diameter

  Internally the parietes are not very strongly ribbed or they are
  almost smooth and there are no pores The basis is concave and
  smooth within and is not porose The sutural edges of the radii are
  quite smooth or sometimes they exhibit in the lower part mere
  traces of septaa character by itself sufficient to separate this
  from the foregoing species The al have oblique summits and the
  rather narrow portion added during the diametric growth of the shell
  is white

  The Scutum externally  d has raised stri radiating from
  the apex valve rather thick internally the articular ridge is but
  slightly prominent and its lower end is rounded off the depression
  for the lateral depressor muscle is slight between this depression
  and that for the adductor muscle the surface of the valve is
  prominent Tergum somewhat beaked externally the surface is
  depressed in the line of the spur the carinobasal margin slopes
  towards the spur

  General AppearanceShell conical generally depressed orifice
  broad triangular almost equilateral walls coloured or only mottled
  with purplishpink having either irregularly branching or regular
  longitudinal ribs which are generally white The radii are pale
  pink or nearly white the opercular valves have either their upper
  parts or nearly their whole surface clouded with pinkishpurple
  the epidermis is not persistent the walls are moderately strong the
  largest specimen was one inch but generally fullgrown specimens are
  about half an inch in basal diameter

  The Scuta have the lines of growth highly prominent From one to
  five or six rows  b  c of nearly circular or transversely
  oblong deep pits extend down the middle of the valve rarely there
  is not even one row in this latter case the valve is not striated
  longitudinally These little pits are caused by one or more deep
  longitudinal furrows crossed by the lines or rather ridges of
  growth In the same group of specimens I have seen individuals with
  three five and six rows and even a few specimens with only one
  row or none at all The outline of the valve is elongated with the
  apex slightly reflexed the inner surface is protuberant sometimes
  to a remarkable but variable degree The articular ridge is not
  very prominent but it extends fully halfway down the valve and
  generally ends in a small free point There is a short adductor
  ridge and a deep narrow pit or cleft for the lateraldepressor
  muscle Terga externally smooth flat with scarcely a trace of
  a longitudinal furrow spur broad  e  f varying from half
  to one third of the width of the valve with the end truncated
  situated either near or quite close to the basiscutal angle The
  crests for the depressor muscles are moderately well developed

  CompartmentsThe parietal tubes are in their upper parts filled
  up solidly without transverse septa The radii generally have their
  summits slightly oblique and this is almost always the case with the
  radii of the rostrum the other radii sometimes extend from tip to
  tip of the parietes and are parallel to the basis rarely the radii
  are considerably oblique The septa of the radii are very obscurely
  denticulated and the interspaces between them are filled up solidly
  The al have their sutural edges thin and smooth

  MouthLabrum with three teeth close together on each side of the
  central notch mandibles with four teeth the fourth being small the
  fifth either absent or scarcely distinguishable from the inferior
  angle maxill without any notch with the two lower spines rather
  longer than the others Cirri In the first pair one ramus is only
  half the length of the other in the second pair both rami are short
  and about equal in length in the posterior pairs the segments
  which are not protuberant bear four pairs of spines of which the
  three lower pairs are short


This species is widelydistributed and where found seems to be common
It is generally attached to shells of mollusca but I have seen it also
attached to wood I have found it associated with B tintinnabulum
var concinnus and coccopoma with B psittacus improvisus and
amphitrite and with Elminius modestus

Young specimens bear a considerable resemblance to certain young
varieties of B tintinnabulum and can indeed be distinguished
from them only by a careful examination of the opercular valves for
it should be borne in mind that in certain cases the scuta in B
tintinnabulum are pitted with little cavities This species in some
respects is I think allied to B porcatus but it is far more
closely related to B spongicola and can be discriminated with
difficulty from certain varieties of this latter species In Mr
Cumings collection there is a group of small specimens crowded
between some older specimens which are remarkable from the shell being
oval in a transverse sectionfrom the smoothness of the wallsand
from the absence of pits on the scuta yet there could be no doubt that
these specimens belonged to our present species

  General DescriptionShell tubuloconical orifice of moderate
  size rather deeply toothed colour dull pink or purplish or dark
  fleshcolour sometimes the radii are paler sometimes of the same
  colour with the parietes Surface smooth when well preserved having
  transverse rows of minute spines In the West Indian variety the
  walls are slightly or much folded but I will describe this form
  separately Size of largest specimen Mus Jeffreys  of an inch
  in basal diameter

  Scutum with fine ridges radiating from the apex and with the
  lines of growth crenated internally the articular ridge is small
  adductor ridge short and barely distinct there is a rather deep
  and narrow pit for the lateral depressor muscle The whole valve
  is much thinner than in B trigonus which in most respects it
  closely resembles Tergum with the apex pinkish purple produced
  or beaked but the beak is not needlelike as in B psittacus
  and its allies for the carinal margin is perfectly preserved up to
  the tip Externally the valve is nearly flat for the longitudinal
  furrow is very shallow The spur is about one third of the width of
  the valve its lower end is abruptly truncated in European specimens
   b the whole basal margin on the carinal side slopes down to
  the spur in a straight line which together with the sharpness and
  production of the basiscutal angle of the spur itself gives to the
  whole valve a peculiar appearance in the specimen  c from the
  Lagulhas Bank the basal margin on the carinal side is a little more
  hollowed out but it is quite impossible to doubt about the specific
  identity of these specimens in the West Indian variety  d the
  basal margin on the carinal side forms a distinct but obtuse angle
  with the spur In all cases the crests for the depressor muscles are
  very feebly developed

  The Compartments have their radii developed to a rather varying
  degree with their summits oblique hence the orifice is toothed
  the sutural edges of the radii have their septa barely denticulated
  the sutural edges of the al are smooth The basis as with the
  other species of this section is permeated by pores yet I found
  one specimen from the Cape of Good Hope with the basis apparently
  solid thus offering a very singular anomaly In the specimen
  imbedded in sponge the basis as viewed externally is concave
  whereas in Acasta which always inhabits sponges the basis is highly
  convex or hemispherical

  The Mouth and Cirri resemble those of B trigonus and I can
  point out no distinguishing character

  With respect to the variety from the West Indies I have seen two
  sets of specimens differing somewhat in external appearance one set
  attached to a coral from St Vincents and another set to an Avicula
  from an unknown locality at first I described these specimens with
  some hesitation as a distinct species and I am very far from sure
  whether this would not have been the more correct course although
  I am unable to point out any sufficient diagnostic characters This
  form differs from the ordinary B spongicola in the walls being
  more rugged stronger and slightly or deeply folded longitudinally
  in this latter case the shell in external aspect differs much from
  ordinary specimens of B spongicola but this is a variation so
  common that I dare not place any reliance on it The colour is more
  purple the summits of the radii perhaps rather less oblique In the
  scuta the only difference is that the articular ridge seems rather
  longer and the adductor ridge perhaps more prominent in the terga
  as already remarked the basal margin on the carinal side does not
  slope so straight into the spur These differences I consider all too
  slight to be of specific value The difficulty in determining the
  nature of this variety is added to by its approach to B trigonus
  in all those points in which it departs from the ordinary B
  spongicola so that for a short time I was even tempted to consider
  both these species as varieties of one form But until B trigonus
  is found with its scutum longitudinally striated and with its tergum
  beaked it can hardly be confounded with B spongicola for it
  should be observed that when in B trigonus the rows of little pits
  disappear from the scuta as sometimes happens though rarely yet
  these valves do not become longitudinally striated

  Balanus spongicola occurs mingled with B tulipiformis in the
  Mediterranean and by the external characters of the shell alone
  cannot be distinguished from that species but the striated scuta and
  beaked terga suffice to separate them Again this species at the
  Cape of Good Hope occurs mingled with B Capensis and from the
  nonstriped young varieties of that species it can externally be
  distinguished only by the beak of the tergum not being sharp like a
  needle I have seen a single perfectly characterised specimen with
  its opercular valves preserved found by Mr S Wood in the Coralline
  Crag at Sutton mingled with B inclusus

  Fossil in an ancient tertiary formation middle bed at Coquimbo
  Chile In a recent deposit var nitidus at the height of 
  feet at Valparaiso with Human remains at San Lorenzo Callao Peru


I may premise that having myself collected this species from the same
locality the Strait of Magellan where no allied species occurs
attached to the same Mytilus and associated with the same Verruca I
feel confident that it is the B lvis described by Bruguire and
there can hardly be any doubt that it is the B discors of Ranzani
With respect to the old tertiary specimens from Coquimbo named B
Coquimbensis by Sowerby they differ from the recent in no respect
except in being considerably larger and therefore I cannot consider
them specifically distinct At first I was unwilling to believe that
the specimens with a single very broad longitudinal furrow and those
with two rather broad or with one narrow furrow on their scuta
could belong to the same species but I soon found that all these
varieties occurred mingled together and that they differed in no
other respect whatever Generally however all the individuals in the
same cluster had the same variety of scutumthus adding one more to
the many instances amongst cirripedes of variations common to whole
groups of specimens Still more unwilling was I to believe that var
nitidus and the common variety could belong to the same species Their
general aspect is totally unlike var nitidus has a smooth clean
naked shell either white or pale purple somewhat globuloconical
often with a nearly entire orifice whereas the other common variety
generally has a more steeply conical shell with a toothed orifice
and is covered by a dirty brownish membrane Moreover though I have
seen hundreds of specimens from Tierra del Fuego I have not seen one
specimen of var nitidus or even of an approach to it in appearance
and on the other hand var nitidus is the common form in Chile and
Peru though I have seen one or two specimens of the membranecovered
variety from Valparaiso Such facts strongly induced me to believe that
these forms were specifically distinct but upon careful examination
I could find no other or more important differences than those just
specified Some specimens from northern Chile are in an intermediate
condition and from Concepcion in the south of Chile where the
climate approaches in character to that of the more southern parts of
the Continent there are many specimens in so intermediate a condition
that I know not whether or no to rank them under var nitidus Thus
I became convinced that these forms are only varieties At Concepcion
some few specimens are pale purple and yet are wholly invested by
thick brown membrane thus uniting the two extreme varieties From
California I have seen both varieties but I do not know which is
most common there With respect to the great difference in aspect
between the specimens from northern Chile and Tierra del Fuego we
shall hereafter see a strictly analogous case in Balanus flosculus
Finally I may add that B lvis seems to represent in the southern
hemisphere and on the west coast of North America the B perforatus
of Europe and Western Africa


  General AppearanceShell conical sometimes slightly globular
  surface smooth that is not folded either naked and in that case
  white or pale purple or covered by dirty yellowishbrown membrane
  Orifice small more or less toothed rarely exceeding one third of
  the basal diameter Radii very narrow often not developed the six
  sutures forming in all cases deep and narrow clefts The largest
  recent but much depressed specimen which I have seen from the
  Strait of Magellan was three fourths of an inch in basal diameter
  specimens growing congregated are often much elongated I have seen
  one with the basal cup between two and three times as deep as the
  height of the compartments Of the ancient tertiary specimens the
  largest had a diameter of three fourths of an inch and a total
  length of actually two inches fig  a another of these fossils
  had a basal cup in depth equalling four fifths of the entire length
  of the shell and basis

  The scutum has either one very broad and deep longitudinal furrow
   b or two moderately broad and deep  e or two narrow and
  deep or less frequently one narrow and inconspicuous longitudinal
  furrow  f rarely there is not one furrow sometimes there are
  none towards the apex whilst furrows have been formed in the lower
  part of the valve In young specimens the furrows extend down to
  the actual basal margin but in old specimens they often fall short
  of this and as a consequence the furrows become crossed by one
  two or three calcareous ridges which ridges at successive periods
  formed the basal margin of the valve The external surface is covered
  by yellow membrane and fragments of several successive opercular
  membranes are often attached to the zones of growth

  Internally the articular ridge is not very prominent but is
  remarkable  c  d from its lower point being produced into a
  long sharp subcylindrical free style like the hinge of a common
  gate which is generally broken off in disarticulating the valve
  from the tergum The adductor ridge is either sharp and prominent
  or blunt it extends up the middle of the valve nearly to the apex
  and downwards it trends a little towards the occludent margin The
  pit for the lateral depressor muscle is minute but deep the basal
  margin is sometimes hollowed out under this pit Sometimes there is
  a distinct but blunt ridge caused by one of the furrows outside
  parallel to the adductor ridge and placed between it and the little
  pit for the lateral depressor in this case the basal margin as
  viewed internally is rendered sinuous  d as is best exhibited
  in the great fossil specimens from Coquimbo

  Tergum  gSpur of moderate length and breadth with its
  lower end obliquely truncated and rounded The longitudinal furrow
  has its edges somewhat folded in The basal margin on the carinal
  side of the spur is sometimes a little hollowed out The crests for
  the depressor muscles are well developed but the corner of the valve
  supporting them is extremely thin and is often imperfectly calcified

  CompartmentsThe parietal tubes are not crossed by transverse
  septa but in their upper parts are filled up solidly The radii are
  always very narrow with their summits oblique though to a variable
  degree their sutural edges have fine and closely approximate septa
  with minute denticuli the sutural edges are received in a furrow on
  the opposed compartment of unusual depth hence the lines of suture
  run in the lower part of the shell almost exactly in the middle
  between each two compartments The al are added to above the level
  of the opercular membrane

  The Basis is often thick with an underlying layer largely
  cancellated or honeycombed When many specimens grow crowded
  together the basis is generally deeply cupformed or even
  subcylindrical and equals as much as four fifths of the length of
  the entire shell In such cases in some few recent specimens and
  in all the large or even quartergrown old tertiary specimens but
  not in the quite young fossil specimens a structure is presented
  which I have not seen in any other Cirripede namely the basis Pl
   fig  a is filled up for one third or even for more than
  half its depth by successive separate calcareous transverse
  layers or septa It would appear as if the basal cup had grown too
  large for the animals body and so required filling up The layers
  are thin and fragile a single layer never stretches across the
  whole shell each is irregularly mammillated or blistered with the
  convex surfaces generally directed upwards the layers are furnished
  on their under sides with little pillars and short ridges resting
  on the layers beneath it rarely happens that the supports of one
  layer lie directly over those of another though this is sometimes
  the case In a vertical section the mass formed by these irregular
  layers has a coarsely cancellated structure This structure although
  confined to this one Cirripede is not so anomalous as might at first
  be thought for in most species of the genus each time that the
  circumference of the basis is added to an excessively thin calcified
  film is thrown down over its whole inner surface and in any of these
  species if the films had been formed thicker and had rested only
  on certain points instead of over the whole underlying layer the
  cancellated structure above described would have been produced

  Mouth the labrum is either destitute of teeth or has two or three
  very minute teeth The palpi have a tuft of very long spines at their
  ends The third tooth of the mandibles is thicker and larger than
  the two upper ones The maxill have either a nearly straight edge
  or the inferior corner is obliquely truncated and projects much
  beyond the rest of the edge In the Cirri none of the segments are
  very protuberant in the first pair one ramus is nearly twice as
  long as the other in the posterior pairs the segments are not much
  elongated but each supports seven pairs of spines

  Var nitidus with respect to this variety I have little to add
  to my preliminary remarks on its peculiar appearance owing to its
  smooth naked condition and pure white or pale purple colour This
  colour when examined through a lens is seen to consist of very
  fine longitudinal stripes and is produced by the calcareous matter
  within the longitudinal parietal pores being thus coloured Generally
  the scuta have two longitudinal furrows but I have seen a scutum
  of one perfectly characterised specimen with only a single broad
  furrow like that which frequently occurs in the membranecovered
  variety Var Coquimbensis as before stated differs only in its
  greater size the scutum in the one specimen examined had two
  broad longitudinal furrows neither it nor the tergum differed from
  certain varieties now found on the coast of Chile

     I have very little doubt regarding any of these references
    I have no means of ascertaining the priority within the same
    year of Gmelin and Bruguire but have given it to the latter
    as perforatus is much the best known specific name English
    conchologists seem generally to suppose that the B communis of
    Pulteney and Montagu is the B porcatus of this work but I have
    not the smallest doubt that I have given it rightly as a synonym
    of the present species the indistinctness of the compartments
    the multitude of fine ridges the smallness of the orifice the
    longitudinal furrow on the terga the colour size and habitat
    all given by Pulteney or Montagu will agree with no other British
    species The Lepas balanus of Poli which is certainly a synonym
    of our present species has been erroneously considered by several
    authors to be the same with the L balanoides of Poli which
    latter undoubtedly is the B amphitrite of this work

  HabSouthern shores of England South Wales Mediterranean
  Western Africa southward to Loanda in  S West Indies 
  Generally adhering to rocks at a low tidal level in one case
  attached to the floating Lepas Hillii Mus Jeffreys


This is a wellmarked species and in its essential characters does
not vary much but owing to the shell being almost as often white as
purpleto its being remarkably subject to disintegrationto its
often becoming cylindricalto the radii being either not at all or
slightly or moderately or largely developed and consequently to the
orifice of the shell varying in size the general external appearance
of the different varieties is singularly diversified but when a series
of specimens is examined it is easy to see how one form passes into
another


  General AppearanceShell conical with the orifice oval
  unusually small being generally only from one third to half of the
  basal diameter sometimes moderately large in one single instance as
  wide as the basis Radii often represented by mere lineal fissures
  or they are narrow or sometimes moderately wide Colour pale dull
  purple sometimes lilac often passing into a dead pure white the
  same individual will occasionally have one part of its shell white
  and another purple the purple tint almost invariably is nearly
  uniform or not in stripes The radii are generally white when
  the whole shell is purple but sometimes they are pale purple the
  sheath is apparently always coloured of a fine claretpurple with
  the triangular portion of the al added during diametric growth
  generally white but sometimes purple The surface is quite smooth
  but very often especially on the shores of England whole groups of
  specimens excepting the very young ones have had the outer lamina
  of the parietes entirely corroded and removed in this case the shell
  assumes a dirty more or less dark ashcolour feebly tinted with
  purple and the whole surface owing to the exposure of the solidly
  filledup parietal tubes becomes finely striated or covered with
  very narrow longitudinal ridges When specimens are crowded together
  they often become cylindrical and much elongated owing to the
  basis becoming deeply cupformed I have seen specimens half an
  inch in diameter in the widest part one inch and a half in height
  the walls forming only a third of this The largest specimen which I
  have seen from the southern shores of England had a basal diameter
  of  of an inch some very steeply conical specimens were  of an
  inch in height and  in basal diameter

  Scuta externally slightly convex growthridges approximate
  moderately prominent Internally Pl  fig  a the articular
  ridge is moderately developed with the lower end produced downwards
  into a freely depending flattened style somewhat variable in
  size but not so long as in B lvis and easily broken in
  disarticulating the valves The adductor ridge is very prominent
  running from almost the apex of the valve close to the articular
  ridge to near the basal margin The basitergal portion of the
  valve is converted by the adductor ridge into a rather deep cavity
  within which there is a short sharp and minute ridge close and
  parallel to the adductor ridge and bounding the impression left by
  the lateral depressor muscle this insignificant ridge was present
  in every specimen it occurs only in very few other species as in
  B nubilus and cariosus The thickness of the valve sometimes
  varies a little and when thick the adductor ridge does not appear
  quite so prominent Tergum with the apex moderately beaked and
  produced beak triangular in section coloured dark purple as is
  the upper internal surface of the valve the longitudinal furrow is
  deep and has its edges folded in and even quite closed The spur
  is moderately long and narrow but its width varies a little Pl 
  fig  b  c and consequently it stands at either rather above
  or at twice its own breadth from the basiscutal angle its lower
  end is either bluntly pointed or square and generally is feebly
  toothed on the underside The basal margin of the valve generally
  slopes a little on both sides towards the spur Internally the
  scutal margin is but slightly inflected the articular ridge is but
  slightly prominent and but little curved in the upper part of the
  valve there are generally several very minute ridges parallel to the
  articular ridge on the side towards the scutum The internal surface
  of the spur itself is sometimes concave The crests for the carinal
  depressor muscle are barely developed It may here be mentioned that
  on the opercular membrane many long spines stand rudely arranged in
  rows

  Parietes the parietal tubes have not transverse septa but
  are solidly filled up in their upper parts by darkpurple layers
  of shell The radii as already stated are either not at all
  developed or are extremely or only moderately narrow with their
  summits more or less oblique in Mr Cumings collection however
  there is an unique specimen var mirabilis Pl  fig 
  c with the aperture of the shell as wide as the basis with
  bright purple parietes and white very broad radii having their
  summits parallel to the basis The septa of the radii are finely
  denticulated and the interspaces are filled up solidly The al
  have very oblique summits and their edges are finely crenated
  Basis flat or deeply cupshaped there is often an underlying
  coarselycancellated layer

  Mouth labrum finely hairy but without any teeth mandibles with
  the th tooth small the th confluent with the sometimes smooth
  sometimes pectinated inferior angle Maxill rather broad with a
  slight notch under the upper pair of spines Cirri first pair
  with one ramus having  segments and above one third longer than
  the shorter ramus having  segments these latter segments are
  remarkable by the extent to which their upper front surfaces are
  laterally produced into projections twice as long as the breadth of
  that portion of the segment which is articulated to the adjoining
  segment These projections have a double row of serrated spines on
  their upper edge and a beautiful radiating bundle at the end the
  projections decrease in length both in the upper and lower segments
  The second cirrus Pl  fig  has the segments  in number in
  the same individual with the segments above enumerated of both rami
  produced in the same singular manner as in the first pair The third
  pair have only inverted conical segments coloured darker purple than
  the other cirri The sixth pair had in the same individual  or 
  segments and therefore one or two more than in the longer ramus of
  the first pair The segments in the posterior cirri have their
  anterior faces shieldshaped and bear  or  pairs of spines with
  some minute intermediate spines There is the usual point at the
  dorsal basis of the penis

     Under the Genus p  I have given the numbers of the
    segments in the cirri of this species at successive ages

  RangeThis species is common on the southern shores of England
  and in the Channel Islands the largest specimens which I have seen
  came from these quarters The most northern point whence I have
  seen specimens is Tenby in South Wales This species is common
  throughout the Mediterranean I have seen specimens from Malaga
  Sicily Algiers and Smyrna thence it ranges down the western
  coast of Africa as far south as the Gambia and Loanda in  south
  latitude I believe British specimens are more often corroded than
  those from further south Amongst some old illkept specimens in a
  box in the British Museum marked Kingston Jamaica there were
  some of this species also I received some specimens marked S
  America from Mr G B Sowerby again Ellis in Phil Trans vol
   part  gives a figure Tab  fig  of some specimens from
  the West Indies which I believe to be B perforatus hence it is
  in some degree probable that this species like B tintinnabulum
  and amphitrite and improvisus may be found on both sides of the
  equatorial Atlantic Balanus perforatus is attached together with
  B tulipiformis trigonus amphitrite Chthamalus stellatus
  and Pollicipes cornucopia usually to rocks near the lower limit
  of the tidal level but I believe from specimens kindly sent me
  by Mr Mac Andrew that it is frequently obtained by dredging
  one specimen was even marked  fathoms According to Poli it is
  sometimes attached to the bottoms of vessels and I have seen a
  specimen adhering to the floating Lepas Hillii

  AffinitiesThis is a distinct species closely allied to no other
  species but comes nearest to B lvis which is its representative
  in Southern America and on the whole west coast of that continent
  It is allied to that species and differs from most other species
  in the general form of the shell its small orifice narrow radii
  and often deeply cupformed basis It agrees to a certain extent in
  the colouring though the purple here is much more prevalent and
  is not confined to the shelly matter filling up the parietal tubes
  It agrees with that species in the general structure of the scutum
  but the two or three deep longitudinal furrows are here absent and
  the minute ridge parallel to and almost under the adductor ridge
  is a peculiarity confined to this and very few species in the genus
  The terga differ from those of B lvis chiefly in the spur
  being narrower and in the apex being beaked Lastly the highly
  protuberant segments of the one ramus in the first cirrus and of
  both rami in the second pair are here remarkable With regard to the
  varieties I have nothing to add to their short diagnostic characters
  above given

     I procured this specimen from the Island of S Lorenzo off
    Callao it was imbedded together with seventeen species of recent
    shells and with human remains at the height of eightyfive feet


This species has caused me much trouble Looking first to the recent
specimens I examined several from Panama and California which
though differing greatly in colour resembled each other in their scuta
having the adductor ridge extremely prominent and in having Pl 
fig  a an almost tubular cavity for the attachment of the lateral
depressor musclecharacters which at first appeared of high specific
value but I soon found other specimens from Panama in which these
peculiarities were barely developed I then examined a single specimen
from the Philippine Archipelago resembling in external appearance one
of the Panama varieties but differing in the scuta being externally
strongly denticulated in lines instead of being merely striatedin
the adductor ridge being far less prominentand in the spur of the
tergum being broader and more truncated I therefore considered this
as a distinct species I then examined a single white rugged specimen
from the coast of Peru which differed from the Philippine specimen
in the shape of the welldefined denticulations on the scuta and in
some other trifling respects and in the segments of the posterior
cirri bearing a greater number of spines with considerable doubt I
also named this as distinct But when I came to examine a large series
of fossil specimens from the Coralline Crag of England from northern
Italy from Portugal and from the southern United States I at once
discovered that the form of the denticuli on the scuta was a quite
worthless characterthat in young specimens the scuta were only
striatedthat the prominence of the adductor scutorum ridge and the
depth of the cavity for the lateral depressor muscle varied much as
in the case of the recent specimens owing apparently to the varying
thickness of the valvethat in the terga the spur varied considerably
in length and breadth the latter character being in part determined
by the varying extent to which the edges of the longitudinal furrow
are folded inand lastly that in young specimens the basal end of
the spur is much more abruptly truncated than in the old Hence I have
been compelled to throw all these forms originally considered by me
as specifically distinct into one species I must repeat that this
considerable variation in the prominence of the adductor ridge and in
the depth of the pit for the lateral depressor musclethe pit in some
cases becoming even tubularis a very unusual circumstance

With respect to the fossil specimens from the abovestated several
distant localities I consider them as certainly belonging to one
species though varying considerably in several points of structure
When compared with the recent specimens they differ from them in often
attaining a considerably larger size in the parietes being often but
not always longitudinally ribbed and in the radii often having more
oblique summits On the other hand considering the many points of
identity between the fossil and the recent specimen I have concluded
without much doubt that they ought all to be classed together I may
remark that in the Coralline Crag specimens the spur of the tergum
Pl  fig  d is unusually long and narrow it is broader and
shorter in the Italian specimens  e and variable in this respect
in the United States specimens the scuta of the Lisbon specimens
are remarkable for the greater prominence of the adductor ridge and
for the depth of the lateral depressor cavity Some of the specimens
from all the several localities are identical with the recent ones
from the coast of Peru The walls of the shell in the Coralline Crag
specimens are generally ribbed longitudinally I have entered into
the above particulars on account of in the first place its offering
an excellent example how hopeless it is in most cases to make out the
species of this difficult genus without a large series of specimens
secondly as showing how the characters alter with age and thirdly as
a good instance of the amount of variation which seems especially to
occur in most of the species which have very extensive ranges

     These will be fully illustrated in the monograph on the Fossil
    Balanid to be published by the Palontographical Society

Some of the pinkstriped Panama varieties though having a somewhat
different aspect can be distinguished from certain varieties of B
amphitrite only by their scuta being longitudinally striateda
character in this species variable in degree and in most cases of
very little value Some of the other recent varieties are sufficiently
distinct from B amphitrite and the great fossil Coralline Crag
specimens which stand at the opposite end of the series of varieties
with their ribbed walls very oblique radii and coarsely striated
scuta are extremely unlike B amphitrite With respect to the
nomenclature of the present species I have little doubt that I have
properly identified the Italian fossil specimens with B concavus of
Bronn who has given a very good figure of this species in his Letha
Geognostica it must however be confessed that the longitudinal
stri on the scuta are not there represented Considering the large
size and frequency of this species in Europe and in the United States
it has probably received several other names besides the two incorrect
synonyms quoted at the head of this description I should add that
the true B cylindraceus not var C of Lamarck according to the
plate given by Chenu in his Illust Conch is the B psittacus of
South America I have seen in collections specimens of B concavus
labelled as B tulipa of Poli B tulipiformis of this worka
very natural mistake without the opercular valves be carefully
examined


  General AppearanceShell conical often steeply conical orifice
  rather small with the radii narrow and generally in the fossil
  specimens very oblique surface generally smooth sometimes rugged
  and in the coralline crag specimens generally ribbed longitudinally
  the ribs being narrow Colour various either dull reddishpurple
  with narrow nearly white or wider dark longitudinal bands or
  again pale rosypink with broad white bands or lastly wholly
  white The radii are either darker or paler than the parietes The
  opercular valves are either dark purple or nearly white Pale pink
  and white stripes are visible on some of the Italian and Portuguese
  tertiary specimens and in most of the fossils the sheath is tinged
  dull red

  DimensionsThe largest actually recent specimen which I have
  seen from the Philippine Archipelago had a basal diameter of 
  of an inch the Peruvian pleistocene specimen is  in diameter
  specimens from the crag and from the Italian deposits however
  sometimes slightly exceed two inches in basal diameter and three in
  height

  Scuta these in young and moderatelysized specimens are striated
  sometimes very faintly but generally plainly causing the lines of
  growth to be beaded but often in large and halfgrown specimens
  the lines of growth are extremely prominent and being intersected by
  the radiating stri are converted into little teeth As the stri
  often run in pairs the little teeth frequently stand in pairs
  or broader teeth have a little notch on their summits bearing
  a minute tuft of spines In very old and large specimens the
  prominent lines of growth are generally simply intersected by deep
  and narrow radiating stri In one case a single zone of growth in
  one valve was quite smooth whilst the zones above and below were
  denticulated The valve varies in thickness which I think influences
  the prominence of the lines of growth and the depth of the stri
  These stri often affect the internal surface of the basal margin
  making it bluntly toothed The articular ridge is rather small
  and moderately reflexed the adductor ridge as already stated
  varies remarkably in most of the Panama specimens it is extremely
  prominent and extends down to near the basal margin in other
  specimens it is but slightly prominent especially in some of the
  fossil specimens from Virginia The cavity for the lateral depressor
  also varies greatly it is often bounded on the side towards the
  occludent margin by a very slight straight ridge which occasionally
  folds a little over making almost a tube this at first I thought
  an excellent specific character but far from this being the case
  the cavity often becomes wide quite open and shallow

  Terga very slightly beaked the surface towards the carinal end of
  the valve in some of the fossil specimens is very slightly striated
  longitudinally There is either a slight depression or more commonly
  a deep longitudinal furrow with the edges folded in and touching
  each other extending down the valve to the spur and causing the
  latter to vary in width relatively to its length When the furrow
  is closed in the spur is about one fourth of the entire width of
  the valve and has its lower end obliquely rounded and stands at
  about its own width from the basiscutal angle when there is only
  a slight depression and no furrow as is always the case with young
  specimens the spur is broader equalling one third of the width
  of the valve with its lower end almost truncated and standing at
  about half its own width from the basiscutal angle But the absolute
  length of the spur also varies considerably it is often very long
  compared to the whole valve The basal margin on the carinal side
  is sometimes slightly hollowed out when the furrow is closed this
  latter side slopes towards the spur Internally the articular ridge
  and crests for the tergal depressor muscle are moderately prominent

  Parietes the longitudinal septa sometimes stand near each
  other making the parietal pores small The radii have oblique
  summits but to a variable degree their septa are unusually fine
  and are denticulated on their lower sides the interspaces are
  filled up solidly The al have their summits very oblique
  with their sutural edges nearly or quite smooth In most of the
  fossil specimens and slightly in some of the recent specimens the
  surface of the sheath presents an unusual character in a narrow
  longitudinal slightly raised border running along the sutures on
  the carinal side of each compartment

  Basis thin porose sometimes with an underlaying cancellated layer

  Mouth labrum with six teeth mandibles with the fourth and fifth
  teeth small either sharp or blunt maxill with a straight edge
  or with the inferior part slightly prominent Cirri with the rami
  of the first pair unequal by four or five segments the segments in
  the shorter ramus are extremely protuberant The segments in the
  second cirrus only moderately protuberant but all the specimens were
  in bad condition and it appeared as if in the Panama specimens
  the segments of the second cirrus were more protuberant than in the
  Philippine Island specimens In the posterior cirri there are from
  three to five pairs of spines on each segment even amongst the
  Panama specimens some had three and some four pairs and a white
  Panama specimen had five pairs of spines


All the recent specimens which I have seen were with one exception
attached to various shells and crabs and to each other The Peruvian
specimen was associated with B flosculus The tertiary specimens are
often congregated together into great masses Including the recent and
fossil specimens this species encircles the globe During the miocene
period it seems to have been the commonest existing sessile cirripede
now it does not appear to be common excepting perhaps at Panama
Mr Cuming procured only one specimen from the Philippine archipelago

  extremely common on ships bottoms often attached to floating

  attached to pebbles and various shells


With respect to the nomenclature of this extremely common species
which is widely distributed in all the warmer seas excepting as
far as I have seen on the west coast of America there is some
difficulty I have no doubt that it is the Lepas radiata of Wood
 but Bruguire in  gave this same name to a Balanus which
he had not seen but which is figured in Chemnitz Tab  fig 
I should have thought that this also had been the present species
but Spengler in describing Skrifter af Naturhist Selskabet i B
 this individual specimen which he calls L purpurea states
that it is  lines in basal diameter now this is a size which is
never acquired by B amphitrite and the description habits and
size would apply equally well to the species which I have called B
amaryllis but when no notice is taken of such points of importance
as whether the walls are permeated by pores whether the radii are
smoothedged whether the scuta are striated it is impossible to
identify with any approach to certainty sessile Cirripedes and
the names given ought in my opinion to carry little weight with
them With respect to Lamarcks Balanus radiatus  the
synonyms quoted exhibit some great and inextricable confusion The
B radiatus again of Risso is a fossil and apparently distinct
species There can be no doubt that the present species is the Lepas
balanoides of Poli and of several authors who have followed him
and equally little doubt that the present species is not the true L
balanoides of Linnus which has a membranous basis and which I have
not seen from the Mediterranean Under these circumstances I have
concluded that less confusion would be caused by giving a new name to
this species than by taking that of Wood which ought not to have been
used by him considering Bruguires previous adoption of it

Under the head of B tintinnabulum I have alluded to the great
variation of B amphitrite which consists not only in a vast
diversity in the colouring and in the general aspect but likewise
in the degree of obliquity of the summits of the radii in the form
of the terga and slightly in that of the scuta In order to show
that it has not been from indolence that I have put so many forms
together I may state that I had already named and fully described
in detail eight of the following forms as species when I became
finally convinced that they were only varieties it would require at
least thirty figures which I have not the power to give fully to
illustrate the transitional forms As with B tintinnabulum the
deception is wonderfully enhanced by whole groups of specimens from the
same locality exactly resembling each other and sometimes differing
from other groups attached to the very same object If a person were
to get together only some fifty or sixty specimens from only half a
dozen different localities he would almost certainly come to the same
conclusion as I at first did that several of the varieties are true
species but when he gets several hundred specimens from all quarters
of the globe he will find to his trouble and vexation that character
after character fails and blends away by insensible degrees and he
will be led as the more prudent course to include as I have done
and I hope rightly all under one specific name I have experienced
more doubt regarding the last variety cirratus than on any other
on account of its peculiar colouring and from the basis being often
irregularly cupformed Under B concavus I have remarked how closely
some of its varieties approach to B amphitrite and it is to this
last variety that they approach almost the only difference being that
the scuta in B concavus are longitudinally striated Yet some of the
varieties of the two species are so distinct that it would be puerile
to class them together I will only add that after studying such
varying forms as B tintinnabulum and amphitrite it is difficult to
avoid in utter despair doubting whether there be such a thing as a
distinct species or at least more than half a dozen distinct species
in the whole genus Balanus

As with B tintinnabulum I will first give a full description of the
more common forms alluding only to each less frequent variation and
then separately describe briefly the more marked varieties


  General AppearanceShape conical either steep or considerably
  depressed sometimes tubular orifice either nearly entire or deeply
  toothed not large varying from rhomboidal to roundedtrigonal
  Surface of shell smooth never ribbed generally naked but
  occasionally the yellowish epidermis is persistent in the same
  individual I have seen all the lower part of the shell thus covered
  and the upper part naked the line of separation being defined
  The colour varies much even sometimes considerably on the same
  individual generally white or pale gray with dull violetcoloured
  longitudinal moderately broad stripes these stripes are sometimes
  equidistant but more usually they are arranged so as to leave
  broad white spaces the stripes fade away by endless variations
  the edges of the compartments and the carinal end of the shell
  longest retaining any colour until we have a uniformly white
  shell generally covered with a yellowish epidermis or the white
  is longitudinally marked with hyaline lines this latter variety
  has a very peculiar aspect and I did not doubt it was specifically
  distinct until in a number of specimens on a ship from the West
  Indies I got the most perfect series and another scarcely less
  perfect series from the Mediterranean graduating into common
  coloured varieties Rarely the dull violet or purple stripes become
  approximate and dark so that the whole shell is tinted of a brownish
  slatecolour occasionally freckled with white Again we have
  another set of very pretty varieties with a white or very pale
  pink ground with either narrow bright pink or broad pinkishpurple
  stripes Again I have seen numerous specimens of a variety var
  Stutsburi from the west coast of Africa in which the upper part
  of the shell is white and the lower part shaded with pinkish or
  dark purple approximate stripes which often become confluent in
  one group the whole shell being thus uniformly coloured without
  any vestige of stripes I have seen another group from an unknown
  locality in which the lower part of the shell was uniformly
  blueishgray A variety from Australia has narrow approximate dark
  claretcoloured stripes transversely freckled with white Lastly in
  the variety cirratus the whole shell is very pale purplishbrown
  with indistinct longitudinal brownish stripes transversely freckled
  with white lines I considered this as a distinct species until
  quite lately finding forms which I could not possibly determine
  whether to class as B cirratus or amphitrite

  The radii are generally snowwhite or freckled with a bright
  mahogany tint or rarely clouded with purple or in the pink
  varieties with pink The scuta are dull purple or pink generally
  with a white band along their tergal margin often however they
  are white with merely one or two purple fasci The thickness or
  strength of the shells varies much some specimens attached to a
  floating cane from Natal and the Philippine Archipelago were
  extremely strong others from the Mediterranean and Australia
  and some tubular varieties from the West Indies were very thin
  translucent and fragile Size large specimens generally attain a
  diameter of from half to three quarters of an inch in basal diameter
  and I have seen one or two specimens an inch in diameter

  Scutum sometimes the surface is very smooth but generally the
  growthridges are moderately prominent the latter are occasionally
  very finely beaded and this seems always the case with var
  cirratus Internally the articular ridge is prominent and reflexed
  the adductor ridge is sharp very prominent and straight it runs
  parallel to the occludent margin close to its lower side there is
  often a depression Pl  fig  i sometimes bounded by a slight
  ridge as if for the attachment of a muscle but there certainly is
  no muscle here rarely the adductor ridge is only slightly prominent
  there is a small and shallow little pit of variable depth for the
  lateral depressor muscle

  Tergum  k o this valve is here far more variable than in
  any other species in the commonest purplestriped forms  l the
  valve is rather broad the basal margin lies in nearly a straight
  line on the opposite sides of the spur which is placed at rather
  less than its own width from the basiscutal angle the spur is
  rather short and in width about one fourth of the entire valve its
  lower end is either bluntly pointed or more commonly nearly square
   k and parallel to the basal margin in young specimens it is
  generally sharper than in older ones Externally in the line of
  the spur there is either a slight longitudinal depression or more
  rarely a deep furrow The carinal margin is more or less convex and
  is formed by upturned lines of growth the scutal margin is broadly
  inflected Internally the articular ridge in the upper part is very
  prominent the crests for the tergal depressor muscle are moderately
  prominent but very variable Sometimes the carinal portion of the
  basal margin is slightly hollowed out In var Stutsburi  m 
  n  o and in some white varieties which differ most in the
  shape of the tergum from the commoner varieties the whole valve is
  narrower the spur is much sharper and narrower the carinal half of
  the basal margin is much hollowed out and slopes down towards the
  spur with the crests for the depressor muscles depending beneath the
  basal margin and with the carinal margin sometimes extremely convex
  or protuberant But the shape and position of the spur and the
  outline of the carinal half of the basal margin vary much in nearly
  all the varieties

  CompartmentsThe upper parts of the parietal pores are either
  filled up solidly with generally coloured shell or they are
  crossed by thin transverse calcerous septa the longitudinal parietal
  septa occasionally bifurcate at their bases close to the outer
  lamina making an irregular outer row of minute pores The Radii
  have their septa rather fine and finely denticulated on both sides
  but sometimes only on the lower side the thickness of the septa
  varies a little the interspaces are filled up solidly the summits
  of the radii are jagged and oblique and usually form an angle of
  about  with the basis not being added to above the level of the
  opercular membrane but not rarely they reach up much higher and
  are very nearly parallel to the basis extending from tip to tip of
  the compartments Again in some ordinary varieties and always in
  var Stutsburi the summits of the radii are extremely oblique the
  radii themselves forming a mere border to the compartments to which
  they belong In no other species have I seen so great an amount of
  variation in the form of the summits of the radii The al in like
  manner have their summits either very oblique not being added to
  above the opercular membrane or they are only slightly oblique it
  often happens that in those specimens in which the summits of the
  radii are nearly parallel to the basis the al are very oblique and
  the converse in other individuals both radii and al have equally
  oblique summits The sutural edges of the al vary in thickness
  being either very thin and obscurely crenated or moderately
  thick and ribbed The basis is porose but I have never seen an
  underlying cancellated layer of shell as is so common in several
  species

  Mouth labrum with from four to eight generally with six little
  teeth mandibles with three teeth and two minute lower teeth or
  mere knobs maxill with the edge straight or with the inferior
  part forming a slightly stepformed projection Cirri the rami
  of the first pair are unequal by three or four segments but in
  some specimens by five or six segments with the front surfaces of
  the segments in the shorter ramus extremely protuberant The second
  pair of cirri are short with the front surfaces of the segments
  moderately protuberant the third pair have a tuft of bristles at
  their bases on the thorax The segments in the sixth pair have from
  four to six pairs of spines on the segments equalsized specimens
  seem to vary in this latter respect There is a small sharp
  projection on the dorsal base of the penis


Varieties

  With respect to var  communis I have nothing further to
  remark except that I have seen specimens identically similar from
  the Mediterranean Natal the Philippine Archipelago and Sydney
  at the latter place it is said to be rare but in most places it is
  the commonest variety and is often attached to ships bottoms Of
  var  venustus I have seen specimens from the west coast of
  Africa Natal and Ceylon in groups by themselves and associated
  with var communis it is much less common than var  The third
  variety pallidus is not uncommon I have seen many specimens
  from the bottoms of ships from the West Indies and the west coast
  of Africa Of the var  niveus I have seen the most perfect
  graduated series passing into var  both from the West Indies
  Florida and the Mediterranean I have seen other specimens from the
  Red Sea and Madagascar Of the var  modestus I have seen
  only one group from an unknown locality it is only remarkable from
  its uniform colouring The var  Stutsburi is more remarkable
  than the foregoing until quite lately I did not doubt that it was
  specifically distinct but as I have seen every character graduate
  into other varieties I am now convinced that it is not a true
  species all the specimens which I have seen have come on shells
  or on ships bottoms from West Africa Of var  obscurus I
  have seen three or four groups of specimens from unknown quarters
  both on pebbles shells and on cork probably from the Atlantic
  ocean and likewise some specimens taken from the bottom of Her
  Majestys ship Fly on the east coast of Australia these latter
  are intermediate in character with the next var variegatus
  from the Australian seas which I at first ranked as an undoubted
  species but I have subsequently failed in discovering any sufficient
  diagnostic character Lastly of var cirratus I have seen several
  groups of specimens from India and the Philippine Archipelago and
  a group intermediate in character between this and the first and
  third varieties from Australia I retained this variety owing to
  its peculiar freckled pale brown colouring and beaded scuta of
  which however I have seen decided traces in the common variety
  as a distinct species after I had given up all the foregoing forms
  I entertain some doubts whether I have now acted right but when I
  found some specimens which I found it impossible to decide whether
  to rank as amphitrite or cirratus I determined to take the more
  prudent course and sink the latter as a species This variety also
  seems to connect B amphitrite and concavus very closely




 BALANUS PCILUS Pl  fig  a  b

Shell dull red freckled with white Scutum internally without an
adductor ridge tergum with the spur sharply truncated almost one
third of width of valve

  HabWest coast of South America Mus Cuming attached to an
  Avicula


The appearance of the fragile shell in the one group of specimens
which I have seen leads me to suspect that they may have grown under
unfavorable circumstances This species differs considerably in general
aspect but not much in essential characters from B amphitrite the
absence however of an adductor ridge to the scutum and the sharply
truncated spur of the tergum are sufficient to distinguish them In
the opercular valves this species comes near to B vinaceus also
from the west coast of South America but the striated scuta of that
species the cancellated inner lamina of the parietes the general
colouring and square porose radii are amply diagnostic characters


  General AppearanceShell fragile tubuloconical orifice large
  passing from diamondshaped into oval Colour fine dark rose
  freckled with transverse sharply pointed fine zigzag white lines
  the pink is also so arranged as to obscurely give to the walls a
  longitudinally striped appearance radii generally rather whiter than
  the walls and similarly freckled terga similarly freckled scuta
  dull red with a white band along the scutal margin Basal diameter
  of largest specimen half an inch

  Scutum externally smooth internally articular ridge moderately
  developed slightly reflexed there is no adductor ridge there is
  a distinct pit for the lateral depressor muscle Tergum with the
  scutal margin unusually prominent toothed longitudinal furrow
  shallow the edges apparently having no tendency to fold in spur
  short barely one third of width of valve with the lower end sharply
  truncated parallel to the basal margin articular ridge and crests
  for the depressores moderately prominent

  CompartmentsWalls very fragile with the outer lamina not
  thicker than the inner lamina Radii fragile broad with their
  summits moderately oblique their sutural edges have the septa
  plainly denticulated on both sides with the interspaces filled up
  solidly nearly to the tips of the septa Al with their summits
  more oblique than those of the radii their sutural edges smooth
  Basis with an underlying cancellated layer Mouth labrum with
  three unusually large teeth on each side of the notch mandibles with
  the fourth tooth tolerably well developed the fifth being confluent
  with the inferior angle Maxill simple Cirrifirst pair with
  one ramus longer by about four segments than the other ramus which
  has considerably protuberant segments second pair with segments only
  moderately protuberant sixth pair with segments much elongated but
  bearing only four pairs of spines

  Attached to ships bottoms from Trinidad and Jamaica associated with
  B tintinnabulum amphitrite and improvisus Brackish water
  Salem Massachussetts according to Mr Stimpson Mus Aug Gould
  Agassiz Stutchbury Cuming W Dunker c very common


  General AppearanceShell conical or almost tubular white with
  the surface very smooth covered by thin yellowish epidermis but
  with the radii naked Orifice large passing from rhomboidal into
  pentagonal moderately toothed Average full size about one inch in
  basal diameter I have seen a specimen  in basal diameter and the
  same in height

  Scutum plainly striated longitudinally the teeth on the occludent
  margin small Internally the upper surface is roughened the
  articular ridge is prominent and either slightly or not at all
  reflexed the pit for the adductor muscle is distinct the adductor
  ridge is prominent in a variable degree and is almost confluent
  with the articular ridge In one specimen from Beverly Bay U S
  the scuta were extraordinarily disintegrated and I could perceive
  no trace of the external radiating stri Tergum with the basal
  margin on the carinal side of the spur sometimes deeply Pl  fig
   b and sometimes only slightly fig  d and rarely hardly
  at all hollowed out when much hollowed out the valve may almost
  be said to be twopronged with the carinal prong narrower than
  the spur There is no distinct longitudinal furrow but the whole
  scutal margin projects above the general surface of the valve In the
  carinal margin in the upper part there is a remarkable convexity
  or protuberance in the same plane with the valve from which it
  is separated by a very slight and narrow ridge The spur is about
  one fourth of the width of the valve with its lower end abruptly
  truncated Internally the upper surface is much roughened with
  finely crenated ridges the distinct crests for the depressores cover
  the whole of the socalled carinal prong

  Compartments the radii and al have their summits oblique
  sometimes a little rounded but not smooth The septa on the sutural
  edges of the radii are remarkably fine and closely approximate the
  denticuli are excessively minute The sutural edges of the al are
  most delicately crenated the al are largely added to during the
  diametric growth of the shell and above the level of the opercular
  membrane The parietal pores are square and rather large they are
  crossed by transverse septa almost close down to the basis the
  longitudinal septa have tolerably large denticuli at their bases
  The pores in the basis are crossed by numerous transverse septa
  When specimens grow in a group the basis is sometimes irregularly
  cupformed

  Mouth labrum serrated with small teeth decreasing in size
  downwards on each side of the central notch Mandibles with the
  third tooth rather thick and blunt and with the fourth and fifth
  knoblike Maxill with the inferior part projecting much beyond
  the rest of the edge and bearing two long single spines between
  these two spines and the large upper pair there are in a fullsized
  specimen about seven pairs of moderately long spines feathered on
  their sides Outer maxill thickly clothed with very fine spines
  and remarkably prominent

  Cirri first cirrus with one ramus having twentysix segments
  and longer by ten segments than the shorter ramus which has sixteen
  segments the shorter ramus and both ramii of the second pair have
  their segments remarkably protuberant in front the protuberance
  in the upper segments equalling in length the supporting part of
  each segment rami of the second cirrus unequal in length by five
  segments Third cirrus with the segments only slightly protuberant
  rami considerably longer than those of the second cirrus at the
  dorsal base of the pedicel of this third cirrus there is no tuft of
  fine hairs as is common in many other species Sixth pair with
  the upper segments elongated bearing from six to seven pairs of
  spines dorsal spines short thin and few

  Affinities in external appearance of the shell this species can
  hardly be distinguished from some of the white varieties of B
  amphitrite and there is a considerable resemblance in some of the
  varieties in the opercular valves but the longitudinally striated
  scuta of B eburneus suffice to distinguish these certainly very
  distinct species Equally or even more like externally is this
  species to the B Hameri so that I have received from an eminent
  naturalist in the United States both species mingled in the same lot
  all bearing the same name of B eburneus but when the internal
  structure of the shell is examined the species are at once seen to
  be far removed from each other Still more close is the affinity
  of this species to B improvisus both in internal and external
  characters it agrees with this species in the singular habit of
  being able to live in brackish water these two species are the only
  ones which have the labrum serrated with teeth graduated in size on
  each side of the central notch In the case of young specimens of
  the var assimilis of B improvisus an inhabitant of the same
  seas with B eburneus the diagnosis is most difficult without long
  practice for in the young of eburneus the compartments are only
  partially covered by yellow epidermis and have a striped appearance
  the radii are sometimes very oblique the scuta externally have not
  acquired their longitudinal stri and internally the adductor ridge
  lies not so close to the articular ridge as it does subsequently
  hence I for some time mistook the var assimilis of B improvisus
  for the young of B eburneus But I found in the latter that the
  rami of the first pair of cirri are always even in the earliest
  youth more unequal in length and that each segment of the posterior
  cirri bears a greater number of pairs of spines there being even in
  very minute specimens seven pairs Moreover after having examined
  scores of specimens I found I could almost always distinguish the
  two species by the smoothness and curvature of the summits of the
  radii of B improvisus I entertain no doubt whatever about the
  distinctness of the two species indeed when both are mature
  besides the greater size striated scuta c of B eburneus their
  general aspect is very different




 BALANUS IMPROVISUS Pl  fig  a c

Shell white radii narrow with their upper margins smooth slightly
arched very oblique Tergum with a longitudinal furrow spur with the
end rounded

  Var assimilis with longitudinal white hyaline lines

  HabEngland Scotland Belgium  Nova Scotia United States
  West Indies Rio Plata Southern Patagonia Guayaquil West Colombia
  attached to wood shells rocks ships bottoms from low tidal level
  to twenty fathoms depth


  General AppearanceShell conical with a rather large
  diamondshaped orifice moderately or but little toothed very
  smooth walls never folded longitudinally white with an extremely
  thin paleyellow persistent epidermis The radii are very narrow
  with their summits very oblique rounded and smooth the epidermis
  is generally more persistent on the radii than on other parts and
  this is exactly the reverse of what is common with B eburneus The
  specimens from nearly freshwater in the R Plata hereafter to be
  mentioned are brownish and have undergone a remarkable degree of
  corrosion the outer lamina of the walls having been entirely removed
  to near the base hence the external aspect of these specimens is
  wholly different from ordinary individuals The var assimilis
  has also a very different appearance owing to the dead white of
  the walls being relieved by narrow approximate longitudinal hyaline
  lines corresponding with and caused by the longitudinal parietal
  septa being externally visible through the outer lamina of the
  parietes the epidermis on the radii is also of a rather brighter
  yellow The largest specimens which I have seen are those from the
  Plata and those attached to a ship from the West Indies and they
  had a basal diameter of  of an inch from  to  of an inch is
  the more usual full average size

  Scuta with the lines of growth but little prominent articular
  ridge prominent but little reflexed adductor ridge straight and
  very prominent varying a little in its distance from the articular
  ridge there is scarcely any depression for the lateral depressor
  muscle the upper internal surface of the valve is roughened with
  ridges Terga with a moderately deep longitudinal furrow spur
  short rather narrow with the end rounded placed at less than its
  own width from the basiscutal angle in the Rio Plata specimens the
  spur is close to this angle the basal margin is generally straight
  on opposite sides of the spur but sometimes on the carinal side it
  is a little hollowed out The lines of growth are upturned along the
  carinal margin which consequently is a little protuberant but to a
  varying degree The crests for the depressores are extremely distinct
  and prominent In the varieties having the basicarinal margin
  hollowed out and the carinal margin protuberant there is a marked
  resemblance to the peculiar tergum of B eburneus

  Walls the parietal pores are tolerably large and are crossed by
  numerous transverse septa the longitudinal septa are very finely
  denticulated at their bases but occasionally almost smooth The
  radii are as stated extremely narrow and very remarkable from
  their smooth rounded edges their septa are barely denticulated
  The al are remarkably protuberant they have their summits much
  less oblique than those of the radii and sometimes they are almost
  parallel to the basis their sutural edges are coarsely crenated
  Basis flat thin permeated by pores but the pores do not
  generally run to the very centre they are as usual crossed by
  transverse septa

  Mouth the labrum is the most remarkable part on each side of
  the central notch there are generally two teeth and on the two
  sides of the notch itself nine or eleven smaller teeth decreasing
  regularly in size downwards till they become so minute as to be
  hardly visible even under the compound microscope thus in the two
  specimens closely examined there were altogether twentytwo and
  twentysix teeth on the labrum Mandibles with the two inferior
  teeth reduced to mere knobs maxill with the lower part of the
  edge bearing two large spines and generally but not always
  forming a stepformed projection Cirri the ramii of the first
  pair are but slightly unequal in one specimen examined there were
  fifteen segments in one ramus and twelve in the other segments very
  protuberant in front Second cirrus with the segments only slightly
  protuberant segments thirteen Third cirrus longer than the second
  pair with the rami rather unequal in length there is a tuft of long
  spines on the basal segment of the pedicel of this cirrus Fourth
  cirrus twentytwo segments Sixth cirrus in the same individual
  thirtyfour segments on each of these segments there are five or six
  pairs of spines I may specify that the longer ramus of the first
  cirrus of a large Rio Plata specimen had twentyfour segments

  Varieties affinitiesWhen I first met with the var assimilis
  misguided by its general aspect I did not doubt that it was
  specifically distinct I was strengthened in this view by the
  absolute identity of several hundred specimens attached to two
  vessels from Jamaica and Trinidad in the West Indies with one
  specimen from Charlestown in the United States sent me by Prof
  Agassiz and with several in three lots from the western tropical
  shores of South America yet on close examination I can point out
  no one distinguishing character either in the shell or animals
  body excepting the longitudinal hyaline lines on parietes due to
  the septa being externally visible The presence of similar lines is
  variable in white vars of B amaryllis and amphitrite and
  they are seen in very young specimens of B eburneus hence it is
  impossible to consider so trifling a character as specific moreover
  lately I have seen a British specimen with hyaline lines and some
  few other specimens in an intermediate condition Under the head
  of B eburneus I have stated that although that species and B
  improvisus which in the West Indies are associated together are
  most readily discriminated when old yet when young they so closely
  resemble each other that the eye requires much practice to separate
  them On account of this species and B crenatus being sometimes
  associated together on the shores of England I have pointed out
  under B crenatus the relative diagnostic characters of the two
  The chief affinity of B improvisus is certainly towards B
  eburneus but in the narrow oblique rounded and smoothedged
  radii there is a relationship shown to the species in the last
  section of the genus such as B amaryllis and more especially to
  the fossil B dolosus so close is the resemblance in the external
  appearance of the shell and in the structure of the opercular
  valves to the latter species that I for some time did not discover
  their distinctness Balanus improvisus has hitherto been overlooked
  by naturalists and has probably been confounded with B crenatus
  or balanoides

  Range and habitsThis species as far as my experience goes
  is commoner on the shores of Kent than on other parts of England
  the first specimens which I met with I owed to the kindness of Mr
  Metcalf they were attached to wooden stakes from Herne Bay together
  with a single specimen of B crenatus I have seen other specimens
  from near Woolwich from the Kentish oysterbeds from Sandwich and
  from Ramsgate The only other British specimens which I have seen
  are from the River Itchen in Hampshire and from Loch Shieldaig
  in Rossshire Mus Jeffreys from a depth of twenty fathoms This
  species is often attached to wood At Ramsgate the specimens were
  attached to a small coasting vessel and they must have been immersed
  five or six feet they were associated with B crenatus and with
  a few of B balanoides In the Brit Mus there are specimens
  collected by Mr Redman from Nova Scotia in North America When
  her Majestys ship Beagle was beached at Santa Cruz in Southern
  Patagonia numerous specimens were found adhering to her copper
  bottom some so small as to show that the species breeds in those
  latitudes Near Monte Video in the estuary of La Plata I found
  many large but much corroded specimens adhering to some rocks in a
  small running stream of perfectly fresh water The rise of the tide
  is here small but at high water the specimens apparently were for
  a short time covered by the waters of the estuary here itself only
  brackish and occasionally almost fresh I took home some specimens
  and placing them in perfectly fresh water they continued for many
  hours expanding and retracting their cirri with perfect regularity
  and vigour Here then we have a Balanus capable of living in fresh
  water and likewise in the saltest seas even brackish water is a
  deadly poison to several probably to most species of the genus but
  this as we have seen is not the case with the allied B eburneus
  The water I may add at Woolwich on the Thames whence I have
  received B improvisus must at times be very brackish I have
  already incidentally mentioned that the var assimilis was attached
  in great numbers associated with B eburneus tintinnabulum and
  amphitrite on vessels from the West Indies one specimen sent me
  by Prof Agassiz from Charlestown was attached to a specimen of B
  eburneus and lastly I have seen three sets of the same identical
  variety attached to shells from Guayaquil in Mus Brit and Cuming
  and from West Colombia Here then we have the same species with
  an enormous range from Nova Scotia and Great Britain to South
  Patagonia and which is the case with scarcely a single mollusc it
  lives both on the eastern and western tropical shores of the South
  American continent

the articular ridge minute adductor ridge prominent forming a deep
pit for the lateral depressor muscle tergum with an internal patch of
purple apex produced purple

  HabCalifornia Mus Brit and Aug Gould associated with B
  glandula and attached to wood


I have seen two specimens of this species brought by Lady K Douglas
from California and two from Monterey sent me by Dr Aug Gould This
is a very distinct species coming nearer to B porcatus than to any
other species it is also allied to B cariosus In the basis being
in parts solid or not permeated by pores it has claims to be placed in
the next section in which I at one time included it


  General AppearanceShell conical rugged sometimes furnished
  with sharp longitudinal ribs dirty white Orifice not large oval
  toothed Radii rather narrow with their summits oblique much
  jagged Basal diameter of largest specimen  height only  of an
  inch

  Scuta broad with the lines of growth prominent internally
  articular ridge very little prominent sometimes hardly developed
  but thick ending downwards in a small free point Adductor ridge
  prominent blunt produced straight downwards making a deep
  longitudinal cavity for the lateral depressor muscle in some
  specimens this cavity is almost arched over so as to tend to be
  tubular with a short ridge in the middle Pl  fig  a in
  other specimens there is no trace of this tubular structure Terga
  with the apex beaked beak triangular dull purple the longitudinal
  furrow is so shallow as hardly to exist The basal margin slopes
  down on both sides with a nearly equable curvature towards the
  spur hence the spur is broad in its upper part and narrow at its
  obliquely truncated lower end Internally there is an elongated dark
  purple patch the shallow articular furrow is of quite remarkable
  breadth the articular ridge is medial and the inflected scutal
  margin is not wide The internal surface of the spur is formed into
  a ridge which runs a little way up the valve and is sometimes
  partially separated from the spur itself fig  c making the
  basal extremity toothed or double The crests for the depressores are
  pretty well developed

  Walls moderately strong inner lamina slightly ribbed the
  denticuli on the bases of the parietal longitudinal septa are sharp
  I could not see any transverse septa in the parietal tubes The
  radii are rather narrow their summits are remarkably jagged and
  very oblique the septa are plainly denticulated on both sides but
  chiefly on the lower side each septum itself towards the inner
  lamina of the radius branches and divides the interspaces are
  filled up nearly solidly The al have apparently their summits
  less oblique than those of the radii their sutural edges are finely
  crenated The lower edge of the sheath is hollow underneath The
  basis is flat it is rather thin and imperfectly porose in parts
  it is not at all porose in others it is traversed only by very
  minute pores there is nevertheless in some parts even where the
  upper layer is not porose an underlying cancellated layer

  Animals body unknown




 BALANUS CORRUGATUS Pl  fig  a  b

Shell white longitudinally folded radii narrow Scutum internally
without an adductor ridge

  Fossil SubAppennine formations Colle in Tuscany Mus Greenough


I have seen only two specimens of this species attached to rock
collected by Mr Greenough at Colle and kindly given by him to me
The species comes near to the living B crenatus also found fossil
in deposits of this same age it differs however distinctly from
that species in having its basis permeated by pores and in a less
degree in the sutural edges of the radii being more plainly crenated
the opercular valves of the two species closely resemble each other
This may be the B stellaris of Bronn but it is futile attempting to
identify the species of this genus merely by external characters even
when aided as in this case by an excellent drawing of the shell


  General AppearanceShell conical with broad rounded longitudinal
  folds orifice of moderate size oval radii narrow with their upper
  margins oblique but the summits of both specimens had been much
  broken Colour as it appears originally white Basal diameter of
  largest specimen  of an inch

  Scuta with the upper portion much reflexed the articular
  ridge is very prominent and the articular furrow of great width
  when the valve is viewed from the outside the articular ridge is
  very conspicuous there is no adductor ridge Terga with the
  longitudinal furrow very slight the spur is from one third to
  one fourth of the width of the valve and its basal end is blunt
  and almost truncated it stands about half its own width from the
  basiscutal angle Internally the articular ridge is very prominent
  and the articular furrow narrow and deep extending down the valve in
  the line of the spur

  Parietes the parietal tubes are remarkably large and I think
  this can hardly be an individual peculiarity the tubes are crossed
  by many transverse septa close down to the basis The radii are
  narrow and have jagged oblique summits their sutural edges have
  very distinct septa barely denticulated with the interspaces filled
  up solidly The al have oblique summits I was unable to make out
  the structure of their sutural edges The Basis is very distinctly
  permeated by pores which are crossed by transverse septa


The shell and opercular valves of B corrugatus so closely resemble
the same parts in B crenatus that I should not be much surprised at
seeing the two species graduating into each other if a larger series
of specimens from beds intermediate in age between the SubAppennine
formations and the present time were obtained If indeed the basis of
B crenatus were permeated by pores the two species could hardly be

  General AppearanceShell conical somewhat convex white
  sometimes tinted yellowish from the thin investing membrane
  the produced tips of the terga are purple the parietes of each
  compartment have from two to four strong prominent sharp straight
  longitudinal ribs these are sometimes irregular and rarely as will
  presently be described they are absent The radii are smooth and of
  considerable breadth their summits are nearly parallel to the basis
  or only slightly oblique hence the orifice is entire it is rather
  small and ovate being broad at the rostral end and very sharp and
  narrow at the carinal end

  DimensionsThe largest specimens which I have seen from Great
  Britain or Ireland have been  of an inch in basal diameter
  in Mr Cumings collection however there was one much depressed
  specimen from the Shetland Islands  in basal diameter a
  regularly conical specimen from the coast of Massachussetts attained
  a nearly equal diameter out of the glacial deposits in the Isle of
  Bute Scotland several specimens had this same diameter namely two
  inches and were even more steeply conical being  in height
  some glacial specimens from Uddevalla and Canada in Sir C Lyells
  collection were  in basal diameter Hence it appears as we
  shall presently see is likewise the case with B crenatus and
  Hameri that northern specimens and those from the United States
  and from the glacial deposits often exceed in dimensions those from
  Great Britain or Ireland

  Scutum the lines or ridges of growth are broad and prominent
  they are divided into square beads by fine stri radiating from the
  apex and hence the valve is longitudinally striated Internally
  the articular ridge is extremely little prominent the adductor
  ridge or what must be called such runs straight down under the
  articular ridge making a deep longitudinal pit for the lateral
  depressor muscle Tergum the apex is a little produced and
  coloured purple as well as the upper internal surface of the valve
  there is no longitudinal furrow only a very slight depression the
  spur is placed close to the basiscutal angle it is rather long
  and measured across the upper part is half as wide as the valve
  its lower end is truncated and rounded the basal margin slopes
  towards it Internally a very small portion of the scutal margin is
  inflected the articular furrow is shallow and broad the crests for
  the depressores are feeble In young specimens the spur is bluntly
  pointed

  The Parietes  e have large square parietal tubes in the
  upper part these are filled up solidly without transverse septa
  the longitudinal septa are finely denticulated at their bases and
  the denticuli extend unusually close to the outer lamina In very
  young specimens the inner lamina of the parietes is ribbed in lines
  corresponding with the longitudinal septa as is the case with most
  species of the genus but in medium and largesized specimens
  there are between the ribs thus produced from one to four smaller
  ribs which do not correspond with any longitudinal septa they are
  finely denticulated at their bases and may be considered as the
  representatives of longitudinal septa which have not been developed
  and reached the outer lamina I have seen no other instance of this
  structure namely the presence of a greater number of ribs on
  the inner lamina of the walls than there are longitudinal septa
  The radii have their summits generally parallel to the surface
  of attachment as is usual in the first section of the genus but
  sometimes they are slightly oblique the septa sometimes rudely
  branch a little but they exhibit scarcely a trace of denticuli the
  interspaces are filled up quite solidly The al have their summits
  very oblique their sutural edges are finely crenated

  Basis rather thin translucent not permeated by pores obscurely
  furrowed in lines radiating from the centre the circumference is
  marked in a peculiar manner by the longitudinal septa and by the
  tips of those intermediate denticulated ribs which occur on the
  inner lamina of the parietes

  Mouth labrum with six teeth mandibles with the fourth and fifth
  teeth small and rudimentary maxill with a small notch under
  the upper pair of spines in the lower part there is a single
  large spine Cirri dark brownish purple making a singular
  contrast with the white operculum and shell first pair with one
  ramus having twentysix segments and about twice as long as the
  shorter ramus having twelve or thirteen segments with their front
  surfaces protuberant In the second pair the segments are but little
  protuberant third pair about one third longer than the second pair
  sixth pair elongated having in the same individual fortysix
  segments these segments have shieldshaped fronts bearing five
  pairs of spines with some minute intermediate bristles There is the
  usual point at the dorsal base of the penis

  Range Geological HistoryThis species is common on the shores
  of Scotland and Ireland the most southern point of Europe whence I
  have happened to see a specimen is Tenby in South Wales but I have
  no doubt it is found further south and Mr Jeffreys who knows this
  species well has found it common on the extreme southern shores of
  England In the United States it is found on the shores of Maine and
  Massachussetts northward I have seen specimens from Iceland from
  Daviss Straits and from Lancaster Sound in lat   north
  these latter I owe to Sir J Richardson It is an inhabitant of deep
  water in Mr Thompsons collection there are several specimens from
  the Bay of Belfast marked twentyfive fathoms and one group said
  to have come from about fifty fathoms on the coast of Antrim one
  specimen from Cape St Anne Massachussetts is marked as having come
  from only five fathoms This species is commonly associated on both
  sides of the Atlantic with B crenatus and sometimes with B
  Hameri and Verruca Strmia mollusca such as pectens modioli
  and oysters offer the most usual surfaces of attachment I have
  however seen many specimens on crustaceans on rocks and even on
  the roots of the larger seaweeds This species is very common in the
  glacial deposits of Uddevalla of Skien in Norway and of Canada and
  is associated with the same species as in the living state I have
  seen also specimens from the same formation in the Island of Bute
  Scotland I have seen numerous specimens from the mammaliferous crag
  and a few from the Red Crag of England I owe to the kindness of Mr
  J de C Sowerby an inspection of the original specimens of the B
  tesselatus of the Mineral Conchology which is certainly the present
  species

  AffinitiesThis species is very distinct from every other it
  comes nearest as shown in all the characters derived from its
  opercular valves to B nubilus and in this latter species we
  have seen the basis plainly tending to lose its pores and thus
  become solid B porcatus is perhaps allied in some degree to B
  trigonus and slightly to B crenatus The rather broad radii
  with their summits hardly oblique give this species a very different
  aspect from those species of the genus amongst which it must be
  placed

  VarietiesA conical specimen sent to me from the coast of
  Massachussetts is remarkable from the radii not having been at all
  developed being represented by mere fissures I have seen a few
  specimens of var a one collected by Sir E Parry in the
  arctic seas which had a remarkably different aspect from the common
  forms but which after a careful examination of the opercular valves
  and of the animals body I feel convinced are not specifically
  distinct they are characterised by the walls being smooth and
  absolutely destitute of the external longitudinal ribs by the shell
  being more cylindrical with broader radii and with the orifice
  larger and more rhomboidal the walls and radii are much thinner and
  the internal lamina is less plainly ribbed the beak of the tergum is
  not purple As most of these specimens had grown in a group crowded
  together the difference of shape and perhaps the thinness of the
  walls is thus explained In a specimen from Daviss Straits in
  Mr A Hancocks collection most of the above characters are in an
  intermediate condition there are only a few external longitudinal
  ribs on the parietes and the terga have not purple apices In Mr
  Cumings collection there are some fine brilliantly white specimens
  without opercula from the coast of China these have thin walls
  and radii and the walls are not longitudinally ribbed but they are
  not smooth the orifice is not large nor the shape of the whole
  shell cylindrical It is just possible that these latter specimens
  may be a distinct and representative species but I do not think so

  HabBengal on wood Mus Brit on a shell Mus Stutchbury
  Philippine Archipelago young specimen Mus Cuming According to
  Spengler on the Coromandel and Malabar coasts


  General AppearanceShell depressed sometimes much depressed
  orifice elongated rhomboidal but little toothed surface smooth
  but in old specimens sometimes with the walls slightly folded
  longitudinally The radii are rather narrow with their summits
  oblique in old specimens their summits are rounded and their
  whole surface finely ribbed parallel to the basis Colour in old
  specimens dirty brown tinged with violet sometimes in longitudinal
  bands and with whiter irregular marks in the upper parts owing to
  disintegration in young specimens the walls are regularly banded
  longitudinally with violetbrown and dirty white the radii being
  generally of a paler dirty red or violet Basal diameter of largest
  specimen  of an inch

  Scuta externally rather smooth internally articular ridge
  prominent reflexed with the lower edge hollowed out so as to be
  slightly hookformed adductor ridge small there is a slight pit
  for the lateral depressor Tergum with the spur bluntly pointed
  placed at about its own width from the basiscutal angle there is no
  longitudinal furrow only a slight depression carinal margin arched
  and protuberant internally articular ridge extremely prominent
  running down in the direction of the middle of the spur crests for
  the tergal depressores well developed

  Parietes with the pores rather large the internal lamina is very
  strongly ribbed the ribs being but slightly denticulated at their
  bases the parietal pores do not appear to be crossed by transverse
  septa sheath closely attached to the walls The radii have jagged
  oblique summits forming an angle of about  with the horizon in
  old specimens they become more oblique and narrow and are then
  very remarkable from their summits being arched and rounded with
  a crenated edge and with their whole surface transversely ribbed
  in horizontal lines this is likewise the case with the recipient
  furrow in the opposed compartments in young specimens the radii are
  externally quite smooth the septa on the sutural edges are bluntly
  denticulated the interspaces being filled up solidly The al have
  their summits oblique but much less oblique than the summits of the
  radii their sutural edges are very finely crenated

  Basis thin either quite solid that is not permeated by pores
  but only furrowed in lines radiating from the centre or permeated
  by pores towards the circumference the pores being of very small
  diameterso that we here have an important character variable
  within the limits of the same species Base flat and this holds
  good as remarked by Spengler even when the specimens are attached
  to cylindrical pieces of wood

  Animals body unknown

  AffinitiesIn the basis being sometimes permeated towards the
  circumference by pores and by the colouring the other species in
  this and the next section being dirty white B patellaris has
  almost as strong a claim to be ranked in the last as in the present
  section in the rounded summits of the radii and in the state of
  the basis it perhaps shows more affinity to B improvisus than
  to any other species it is however almost equally allied to B
  glandula

I find in most collections this species confounded with B
balanoides I have even seen the two species placed by Leach on
the same tablet in the British Museum B balanoides is moreover
generally confounded with Chthamalus stellatus nor has any one
hitherto separated the present species from B improvisus On the
other hand trifling varieties both of B balanoides and B
crenatus have commonly been considered as specifically distinct From
these facts it will be seen in what confusion our commonest British
species of Balanus have been left After due deliberation I have
little doubt that this is the B crenatus of Bruguire and probably
the B rugosus of Montagu but this latter author omits all reference
to the really important diagnostic characters between this species and
B balanoides The B crenatus is certainly the B rugosus of Dr
Aug Gould In various collections I find specimens of B crenatus
when coming from the arctic regions called B glacialis arcticus
and borealis though I have not met with an authentic specimen of the
B glacialis of Gray Supp Parrys Voyage  p ccxlvi I
have little doubt that it would prove to be the present species


  General AppearanceWhite usually of a dirty tint from the
  yellowish or brownish persistent epidermis conical generally
  fig  a with the parietes rugged and irregularly folded
  longitudinally but sometimes much depressed and extremely smooth 
  b often cylindrical and very rugged occasionally clubshaped 
  c the upper part being much wider than the lower specimens in
  this latter condition sometimes have extremely narrow parietes like
  mere ribs and wide radii The orifice in the cylindrical varieties
  is often most deeply toothed The radii are generally narrow and
  have jagged oblique summits but not infrequently they are so narrow
  as to form mere linear borders to the compartments The orifice is
  rhomboidal passing into oval either very deeply or very slightly
  toothed

  DimensionsThe largest British specimen which I have seen was
  only  of an inch in basal diameter specimens from Greenland
  and the northern United States frequently attain a diameter of
  threequarters of an inch and I have seen one single somewhat
  distorted specimen actually  of an inch in basal diameter The
  specimens from the glacial deposits of Uddevalla and Canada appear
  on an average to attain as large or larger dimensions than those
  from the United States on the other hand the specimens from the
  mammaliferous and Red Crag are smaller the largest being only  in
  basal diameter When individuals have grown crowded together their
  length is often twice and even occasionally thrice as great as
  their greatest diameter thus I have seen a Greenland specimen  of
  an inch in length and only  in diameter In the British Museum
  there are some arctic specimens one and a half inch in length only
  half an inch in diameter at the summit fig  c thence tapering
  downwards to a blunt point

  Scuta the lines of growth are but little prominent the surface
  is generally covered by disintegrating membrane The upper ends
  are usually a little reflexed so that the tips project freely as
  small flattened points Internally the articular ridge is highly
  prominent and somewhat reflexed there is no adductor ridge but a
  very distinct impression for the adductor muscle the depression for
  the lateral depressor muscle is small but variable The terga
  are rather small the spur is short and placed at rather less than
  its own width from the basiscutal angle the basal margin slopes a
  little towards the spur of which the lower end is rounded or bluntly
  pointed in a variable degree There is no longitudinal furrow hardly
  even a depression Internally the articular ridge is very prominent
  in the upper part the crests for the tergal depressores are well
  developed but variable

  CompartmentsThe internal carinal margin of each compartment
  from the sheath to the basis generally but not invariably projects
  a little inwards beyond the general internal surface of the shell
  in a manner not common with the other species of the genus the
  basal edge of this projecting margin rests on the calcareous basis
  and is crenated like the basal edges of the longitudinal parietal
  septa The whole internal surface of the shell is ribbed but the
  ribs are not very prominent The parietal tubes are large and are
  crossed in the upper part and often low down by transverse thin
  septa the longitudinal parietal septa are only slightly denticulated
  at their bases occasionally they divide at the basis close to the
  outer lamina of the parietes making some short outer subordinate
  pores In the circular furrow beneath the lower edge of the sheath
  there are sometimes little ridges dividing it into small cells
  sometimes however this furrow is filled up by irregular knobs of
  calcareous matter The radii are always rather narrow and often
  they form mere linear ribbons of nearly uniform width along the
  edges of the compartments Their summits or edges are always more or
  less irregular and jagged they form an angle with the horizon of
  generally above  Their septa are fine and barely or not at all
  denticulated The al have oblique summits their sutural edges are
  rather thick and distinctly crenated Basis flat calcareous very
  thin with the surface slightly marked by radiating furrows which
  furrows answer to the radiating pores that occur in the bases of most
  species In a clubshaped arctic specimen one inch and a half in
  length the summit being half an inch and the base only one fifth of
  an inch in diameter the basis was still calcareous thick and not
  permeated by pores

  Mouth labrum with six teeth mandibles with the fourth tooth
  minute or rudimentary and the fifth generally confluent with the
  inferior angle Maxill with generally but not invariably a small
  notch under the upper pair of great spines Cirri first pair with
  the rami very unequal in length one ramus being nearly twice the
  length of the other in a large specimen having a cylindrical shell
  the proportional numbers of the segments in the two rami of the first
  cirrus were ten to twentythree in a small conical specimen the
  numbers were only eight to thirteen The second cirrus has only two
  or three more segments than the shorter ramus of the first pair the
  third cirrus has one or two more segments than the second but it is
  nevertheless decidedly longer than the second On the dorsal surfaces
  of both segments of the pedicel of the third cirrus there is a
  tuft of fine spines The segments of these three pairs of cirri are
  not much protuberant in front The segments of the posterior cirri
  have each four or five or six pairs of spines Penis with a
  straight sharp short point on the dorsal basis

  Range habits cI have received specimens from all parts of the
  coast of Great Britain and Ireland generally attached to crustacea
  and mollusca and never hitherto from rocks uncovered by the tide
  This species is also attached to floating timber sticks fuci and
  occasionally to pebbles at the bottom of the sea Mr Thompson has
  sent me specimens from twentyfive fathoms depth in Belfast Bay
  others on a Pinna from about fifty fathoms on the coast of Antrim
  others from between three and six fathoms attached to Laminaria
  digitata there is a specimen in Mr Jeffreys collection marked
  fortyfive fathoms It is often associated both on the coasts of
  America and Britain with B porcatus and though these species are
  so distinct yet when both have their surfaces similarly affected by
  being attached as is often the case to large Pectens it is not at
  first easy by external characters to distinguish them except by
  close inspection of the terga which in B porcatus are beaked and
  purple The B crenatus is sometimes associated in deep water with
  B Hameri At Ramsgate in Kent I saw a rudder of a ship in which
  the two or three upper feet were thickly coated with B balanoides
  and the two or three lower feet with B crenatus and improvisus
  mingled together with a few of B balanoides occasionally
  vessels are thickly encrusted with this species but I have never
  seen an instance of its concurrence with B tintinnabulum and
  amphitritethe commonest species on ships coming from the south
  I have seen specimens from Greenland Baffins Bay the coast of
  Labrador and other specimens marked simply Arctic regions and
  again others from the shores of Maine and Massachussetts The arctic
  specimens and those from the northern United States are larger
  than the British I have seen one single minute specimen on a crab
  marked as having come from the Mediterranean In the British Museum
  amongst some specimens of B eburneus ticketed as having been sent
  from Jamaica there was a small group of specimens differing in no
  one essential respect from the common varieties of B crenatus
  at first I concluded that this was an erroneous habitat and that
  the specimens had really come from the United States where B
  eburneus is found as well as in the West Indies for it appeared
  to me exceedingly improbable that an animal which can exist in lat
   N should inhabit the hot shores of Jamaica but subsequently I
  have received a specimen from Prof Krauss collected by himself in
  Algoa Bay which is perfectly characterised and even has the little
  cells in the furrow under the sheath so that I am compelled to admit
  this enormous range and capability of resisting the most extreme
  climates That this species should live in the tropical seas is the
  more surprising as the large size of the specimens in the northern
  seas and in the glacial deposits might fairly have been supposed
  to have indicated special adaptation for a cold climate The great
  geographical range of this species accords with its range in time
  from the present day to the Coralline Crag period

  The specimens from the glacial deposits which I have examined
  chiefly in Sir C Lyells collection are very fine and large they
  are often associated like the now living individuals with B
  porcatus and Hameri they come from the wellknown formation of
  Uddevalla and from Canada There are wellcharacterised specimens
  in the mammaliferous Crag at Bramerton and near Norwich in Sir C
  Lyells collection and from Sutton and other places in the Red Crag
  of the eastern shores of England these specimens are decidedly not
  only smaller than the glacial but than the recent English specimens
  for the largest Crag specimens which I have seen had a basal diameter
  of only  of an inch The specimens which I have seen from the
  Coralline Crag and some others sent me by Krantz from the miocene
  formation of Flonheim bei Abzei in Germany had not their opercular
  valves yet I cannot doubt considering how few species there are in
  the present section of the genus that I have rightly identified them

  DiagnosisUnder the head of B balanoides I shall make a few
  remarks on the diagnosis between that and the present species as B
  improvisus is found on the British shores sometimes mingled with
  B crenatus I may observe that externally the only difference
  consists in the edges of the radii in B improvisus being much
  smoother and rounded and in the whole shell being less rugged
  Internally in B improvisus the porose basis the presence of an
  adductor ridge on the under side of the scutum the graduated teeth
  on each side of the central notch in the labrum and the little
  inequality in length of the rami of the first pair of cirri are
  clearly and amply diagnostic




 BALANUS GLANDULA Pl  fig  a  b

Shell white parietes with the internal lamina generally strongly
ribbed longitudinally with the pores imperfect and small sometimes in
part absent radii narrow with their summits rounded Scutum with an
adductor ridge tergum with the spur truncated and rounded

  HabitatCalifornia Mus Cuming Aug Gould attached to shells
  and wood together with B nubilus Southern Pacific ocean
  attached to Pollicipes polymerus Mus Brit


  General AppearanceShell steeply conical or cylindrical and
  elongated dirty white walls rugged longitudinally folded radii
  narrow with their summits very oblique and rounded orifice toothed
  Basal diameter of largest specimen half an inch

  Scutum resembling externally that of B crenatus rather broad
  surface smooth articular ridge very prominent and articular furrow
  very wide hence when the summits of the opercular valves are worn
  down the two scuta together form a square projection indenting
  the two terga as in B balanoides Internally there is a small
  adductor ridge on the lower side of which there is a pit as if
  for a muscle The depression for the lateral depressor muscle is
  small but variable Tergum without any longitudinal furrow and
  hardly a depression spur broad with its lower end truncated and
  rounded internally articular ridge very prominent crests for the
  depressores well developed

  CompartmentsThe internal surface of the parietes is smooth in
  the upper part beneath the sheath but generally very strongly ribbed
  in the lower part the ribs being plainly denticulated at their
  bases in other specimens the ribs are very small and even in parts
  quite obsolete The parietal pores are short and imperfect sometimes
  reduced to an extremely minute size to be detected only when the
  walls are broken across near the basal edge and most carefully
  examined occasionally not even a trace of a pore exists Hence in
  this respect this species offers a singular case of variation The
  radii are narrow and of nearly the same width from top to bottom
  their very oblique summits when well preserved are smooth and
  rounded their sutural edges are ribbed or crenated with extremely
  fine smooth septa the recipient furrow is plainly marked by these
  septa The sutural edges of the al are crenated their summits are
  less oblique than those of the radii

  Basis thin finely furrowed in lines radiating from the centre
  margin sometimes deeply sinuous

  Mouth labrum with the central notch rather widely open with four
  teeth on each side of it palpi with very short spines along their
  inner margins mandibles with the fourth and fifth teeth forming
  mere knobs maxill small with a mere trace of a notch under the
  two great upper spines Cirri first pair with the rami unequal by
  three or four segments the longer ramus being only one quarter of
  its own length longer than the other ramus Second pair short with
  the segments and those of the shorter ramus of first pair somewhat
  protuberant Third pair with the rami one third longer than those of
  the second pair Sixth pair with the upper segments elongated and
  bearing six or seven pairs of spines

  AffinitiesThis species in general appearance closely approaches
  B crenatus and balanoides and it is related to them in many
  essential parts such as in the opercular valves It agrees with B
  balanoides and differs from B crenatus in the smallness and
  imperfection of the parietal pores and in the radii having rounded
  summits it agrees with B crenatus in the structure of its basis
  and in the prominent longitudinal ribs on the internal surface of the
  parietes and differs from that species in the spur of the tergum
  being squarer and in the scutum having an adductor ridge

  RangeFrom the appearance of the Californian specimens I suspect
  that they had adhered to tidal shells and to wood The specimens in
  the British Museum adhering to Pollicipes polymerus consist of
  two lots one of unknown origin and the other certainly brought from
  the southern half of the Pacific Ocean by Sir James Ross it deserves
  notice that the Pollicipes polymerus the supporting object
  ranges from California to the southern Pacific Ocean

  HabitatGreat Britain France Norway Shetland Islands

  common attached to rocks shells and wood within the tidal limits


I have no doubt that the present species is the Lepas balanoides
of Linnus though O Fabricius is the only author who gives in his
Fauna Groenlandica a sufficient description for the species to be
recognised with certainty I believe this also is the B balanoides
of Bruguire though he is in error as far as my experience goes
in stating that the basis is ever calcareous I have little doubt
also that this is the B vulgaris of Da Costa The B balanoides
in its corroded and therefore punctured state is certainly the B
punctatus of most British collections but I do not believe it is
the B punctatus of Montagu which I have scarcely any doubt is
the Chthamalus stellatus so often found in the southern shores of
England and even in some of the best arranged collections mingled
with our present species


  General AppearanceThe shell in middlesized and old specimens
  is almost invariably folded longitudinally and irregularly it is
  either dirty white or very often pale brown and punctured from the
  outer lamina having been corroded to which action it is extremely
  subject In very young specimens the surface is usually quite white
  and smooth The shell is sometimes much depressed generally conical
  but when crowded together cylindrical or clubshaped one specimen
  being even more than fiveandahalf times as long as wide In Mr
  Jeffreys collection there is a specimen  of an inch long  in
  diameter at the summit only  in the middle and rather more than
   near the base Another specimen was  in length its greatest
  diameter being  of an inch at the summit On the other hand I
  have seen a very depressed variety with deeply folded walls in
  Mr Thompsons collection from near Dublin which was no less than
  four times as wide as high so that the difference in proportion of
  height and greatest width in the two extreme specimens was nearly
  as  to  Occasionally from some unknown cause isolated specimens
  become cylindrical The orifice of the shell in the much elongated
  specimens is generally deeply toothed The radii are always narrow
  sometimes extremely narrow and have their summits smooth and rounded

  English specimens do not usually attain half an inch in basal
  diameter I have however seen one from near Yarmouth  of an inch
  in diameter Specimens from Massachussetts seem rather larger than
  the average size of British specimens many being  of an inch and
  one specimen a whole inch in basal diameter

  The opercular valves so closely resemble those of B crenatus
  that the description is necessarily comparative in some cases they
  could hardly be discriminated generally owing to the disintegration
  to which this species is subject the tips of the scuta are worn off
  and hence the articular ridges together form Pl  fig  a a
  square projection indenting the two terga but I have examined young
  specimens and others when not disintegrated in which the opercular
  valves viewed externally presented no difference whatever from
  those of B crenatus The scuta however are I think generally
  rather thicker with the growthridges more prominent and with
  the tips certainly less reflexed than is usual with B crenatus
  Internally the articular ridge is rather less prominent there is
  no distinct adductor ridge The terga are often rather narrower
  in proportion and this especially holds good in the elongated
  varieties in these latter there is occasionally a moderately deep
  longitudinal furrow the spur is often exactly the same shape as in
  B crenatus but it is apt to be rather longer Pl  fig  c
  and more pointed in var a it is pointed fig  d in a
  very remarkable manner Internally the articular ridge is decidedly
  more prominent than in B crenatus the crests for the tergal
  depressor muscles are either well developed or almost absent From
  this description it will be seen how singularly the opercular valves
  of the common varieties of these two species resemble each other I
  may mention that in some of the much elongated specimens the muscles
  going to the opercular valves partially lose their transverse stri
  and become ligamentous

  The Parietes are either quite solid or more commonly are permeated
  by minute pores or by small irregular square tubes Pl  fig 
  b which only run up each successive zone of growth for very
  short distances giving to the shell a cancellated structure which
  from corrosion is often externally visible In the rather rare
  variety a the parietes are permeated by regular tubes extending
  up to the apices of the compartments but crossed by transverse
  septa The longitudinal septa when such can be said to occur in
  no case are denticulated at their bases The internal surface of
  the parietes is either quite smooth or is traversed Pl  fig 
  b by very slight anastomosing ridges but never even in var
  a by regular longitudinal ribs as in most other species The
  carinal margin of each compartment on the inside projects as in
  B crenatus inwards beyond the general surface of the shell and
  running down rests on the basal membrane The lower edge of the
  sheath is rarely hollow beneath The walls are lined by purplish
  or pale brown or sometimes by almost black corium numerous tubuli
  penetrate the under sides of the walls and opercular valves and
  it is the intersection of these tubuli that gives the punctured
  appearance to the often corroded surface of the shell The radii
  are narrow generally very narrow they have their upper and outer
  margins as seen externally very oblique rounded and when well
  preserved smooth their sutural edges are either quite smooth
  or sometimes just perceptibly pitted like the basal margin of
  the walls or occasionally furnished with globular or arborescent
  little ridges The al are also very oblique but to a variable
  degree sometimes only slightly oblique their sutural edges are
  either smooth or obscurely crenated Basis membranous in some
  much elongated specimens during continued growth the basal edges
  of the compartments approach each other so closely as almost to
  touch so that the whole shell becomes pointed at the bottom but
  on careful inspection I have never failed to find even in the most
  pointed specimens a minute basal membrane in other much elongated
  varieties in which the shell has apparently become too large for the
  animals body the basal membrane instead of being flat becomes
  drawn up deeply inwards so as to touch the surface of attachment
  only close round the basal edges of the shell

  Mouth labrum with the teeth on each side of the central notch
  unusually variable in number I have seen specimens with only two
  on each side with four on each side with five on one side and
  four on the other with five on one side and none on the other
  and with six on both sides hence the total number ranges from four
  to twelve Mandibles with the fourth and fifth teeth small or
  quite rudimentary Maxill with scarcely even a trace of a notch
  under the upper pair of spines Cirri first pair with one ramus
  one third or one fourth longer than the other in one specimen the
  number of segments were nine and sixteen in the two rami second
  and third cirri short very nearly equal in length having in the
  justmentioned specimen respectively ten and eleven segments the
  sixth cirrus in this same specimen had twentyfive segments each
  segment being about as long as broad and supporting six pairs of
  spines In the singular variety a the posterior cirri are more
  elongated and each segment supports seven or eight and in one case
  even ten pairs of spines the third pair is also in this variety
  proportionally rather longer At the base of the third pair there
  is a tuft of fine spines The penis has not as in B crenatus a
  point at its dorsal basis The branchi are very little plicated


Varieties

  Of the varieties having much elongated clubshaped hourglass
  shaped and depressed shells there is no necessity to say anything
  in particular With respect to the remarkable variety a I at
  first named and described it as a distinct species I have received
  two lots both from North America one being sent me by Professor
  Agassiz from Cape Cod These agreed in having the parietes permeated
  by regular tubes in having the spur of the tergum most sharply
  pointed in the third pair of cirri being proportionally longer
  compared with the second pair in the sixth pair having more numerous
  segments namely three times as many as in the third pair in the
  segments of the posterior cirri being more elongated and especially
  in the number of pairs of spines on each segmentamounting in one
  case even to ten a number unparalleled in other cirripedes It may
  naturally be asked why I have not retained so well marked a form as
  a distinct species In the first place I found the most remarkable
  character in var a namely the number of pairs of spines
  on the posterior cirri variable there being in one lot seven or
  eight pairs and in the other lot nine or ten pairs on each segment
  Secondly all the characters by which this variety differs from the
  common B balanoides are those which are variable in the latter
  this is especially the case with the structure of the parietes and
  in a lesser degree with the spur of the tergum Thirdly I found a
  specimen in Mr Cumings collection from Sweden so that this var
  a is not confined to North America in which the cirri quite
  resembled those of the American specimens but the spur of the tergum
  was in an intermediate condition as compared to that of ordinary
  varieties and the parietal tubes were of unequal sizes and scarcely
  more regular than sometimes in the true B balanoides And lastly
  I have seen specimens from Ayrshire with the parietes permeated by
  regular tubes but with the tergum in an intermediate condition and
  with the segments of the posterior cirri not more numerous or more
  elongated than in B balanoides supporting only six or seven pairs
  of spines that is only one more than is common with B balanoides
  so that it was impossible to decide whether to rank the Ayrshire
  specimen under var a or under the common form so that I was
  compelled to give up var a as a species

  Monstrous individuals with the male organs aborted
  ParasiteAmongst some specimens chiefly elongated ones sent to
  me from Tenby in South Wales I found no less than seven individuals
  with some of the posterior cirri distorted unequal on the opposite
  sides and in an almost rudimentary condition and in each case
  with the penis truncated without any muscle entering the stump
  which was absolutely imperforate the vesicul seminales were
  much shrunk in one case without any zoosperms in another case
  with headless zoosperms cohering in an unusual manner hence it is
  certain that these individuals were functionally only female and
  could not impregnate their own ova yet in two instances the ova
  had been impregnated no doubt by neighbouring perfect individuals
  for they contained welldeveloped larv Several of these monstrous
  individuals were infested by one two or three curious crustaceans
  which have been described by Mr Goodsir as the male of the
  Balanus but these supposed males are females and were distended
  with ova containing almost mature larv I believe that they are the
  females of the unnamed genus belonging to the family of Ioniens
  described by Mr Goodsir which live parasitic within the sack as I
  likewise found of the same individual Balani

  DiagnosisI have seen several specimens of this species and of
  B crenatus absolutely undistinguishable in external appearance I
  may specify one of B balanoides imbedded in an alcyonidium and
  one of B crenatus imbedded in a sponge and therefore neither at
  all abraded Generally the tips of the scuta in B crenatus are a
  little reflexed whereas in B balanoides when the shell has been
  at all disintegrated the tips form a square projection locked into
  the terga Bal crenatus never assumes the punctured appearance so
  common in B balanoides Very young specimens of the latter can be
  distinguished by their dead white colour and smoothness The edges
  of the radii are almost always smoother than in B crenatus and
  they are never so wide as is sometimes the case with B crenatus
  When a specimen is disarticulated our present species can at once
  be distinguished from B crenatus and from B improvisus by
  its membranous basis and by the solid or cancellated walls which
  are rarely permeated by regular tubes or pores and the walls when
  porose are not internally ribbed I have already pointed out the
  few very trifling points in which the opercula of the two species
  differ The mouth and cirri offer likewise very few differences in
  B balanoides there are often more teeth on the labrum than in B
  crenatus the rami of the first cirri are perhaps here rather less
  unequal the second and third pairs of cirri are certainly in most
  cases more equal in length and lastly the segments of the sixth
  cirri even in the common varieties bear in equalsized specimens
  more pairs of spines than in B crenatus We shall see that in
  habits with regard to depth the two species differ B balanoides
  inhabiting much shallower water than B crenatus

  Range Habitats cThis species is extraordinarily abundant
  within the tidal limits round the shores of Great Britain and
  apparently of the northern United States Besides numerous specimens
  sent to me from very many English localities the late Mr W
  Thompson of Belfast kindly placed in my hands his very large
  collection from these materials it appears that B balanoides
  is the only tidal species in the northern parts of our island but
  in the south and southwest it is associated with the Chthamalus
  stellatus and Balanus perforatus I doubt whether this species
  ever lives below the lowest tides the case of a few specimens being
  mingled with B improvisus and crenatus mentioned under the
  latter species at the bottom of a rudder of a small vessel about
  six feet deep is hardly an exception for the water would there
  be troubled and arated almost as in a breaker and on this very
  rudder the upper two or three feet were coated exclusively by the
  B balanoides This species lives on rocks at both the uppermost
  and lowest limit of the tides I am informed by Mr Thompson that
  he has seen specimens attached to a spot not covered by water
  during neaptides As a proof of its tenacity of life Mr Thompson
  informs me that he accidentally kept some specimens in a box in a
  warm sittingroom and found them alive seven days afterwards This
  same most accurate observer finds however that B balanoides
  is very susceptible to brackish water he says that having kept
  some specimens alive for a week in excellent health the water being
  changed once in thirtysix hours they were one day killed instantly
  by some water though brought from the same part of the estuary as
  usual having been rendered brackish by much rain having lately
  fallen I may recall the fact that B improvisus lives daily for
  hours in absolutely fresh running water

  The B balanoides lives attached often continuously coating
  many square feet of the surface to rocks pebbles woodenpiers
  littoral shells and ulv The most northern point whence I have
  received specimens is in lat   in North America collected
  by Mr Sutherland and the most southern point is Delaware Bay in
  the United States in lat  I do not believe that this species
  extends into the Mediterranean for Ranzani Mem di Storia Nat
  who particularly attended to the nature of the basis was not
  acquainted with any Balanus having a membranous basis and Poli
  Test Ut Sicili describes only two species thus characterised
  and these are manifestly Chthamali


With respect to the rate of growth of this species I am indebted to
Mr W Thompson for the following note

  Sept  I examined a great number of Balani in reference
  to the growth made by them during the present season and found it
  to average three lines in diameter and at most four lines I saw a
  few minute specimens only one line in diameter showing that the
  species continued to breed until lately these latter were probably
  not more than four weeks old The young of the present year are
  plainly distinguished from the older ones by their pure white colour
  and fresh appearance Judging from the size of this years specimens
  and of the older ones on the same stones I am of opinion that the
  term of life of the species is two years Of the older shells which
  I examined and found living in the spring nine tenths are now dead
  the walls only remaining the opercular valves having been washed
  away

Mr Thompson goes on to say that the individuals which had on July 
a basal diameter of from two and a half to three lines had attained
by the th of September a diameter of four and a half lines this
being here the maximum size of the species

narrow with the apex beaked and spur sharply pointed

  HabColumbia River west coast of North America Mus Brit

  according to Pallas Attached to shells and to each other in groups


  General AppearanceShell steeply conical with a rather small
  oval orifice or cylindrical with a large rhomboidal and little
  toothed orifice Colour dirty white Surface either simply rugged
  or more commonly covered by numerous narrow extremely prominent
  longitudinal plaits from the manner in which these overlap each
  other the shell almost appears as if thatched with straw The
  upper corroded part of the shell usually exhibits a cancellated
  and finely punctured surface The radii are generally very narrow
  forming towards the base of the shell a mere narrow ribbon to each
  compartment and often hardly distinguishable but in one specimen
  they were of considerable width in the former case the al are
  often widely exposed The largest specimen which I have seen was 
  of an inch in basal diameter but Pallas gives  as the measurement
  of a specimen from the Kurile Islands

  The opercular valves are united to each other and to the shell by
  unusually strong membrane and the upper parts of both valves in all
  the specimens seen by me have been much disintegrated The Scutum
  in old specimens is faintly striated longitudinally but in some
  there is hardly a trace of this the occludent margin is furnished
  with a few large knobs not corresponding with every alternate line
  of growth as is usual with other species but with every fourth or
  fifth line Internally the articular ridge is moderately prominent
  in young specimens more prominent and reflexed The adductor
  ridge is sharp and prominent in the upper part it is confluent
  with the articular ridge but in young specimens can be seen to be
  distinct in the lower part it borders a large deep cavity for the
  lateral depressor muscle in the middle of which there is a very
  slight longitudinal ridge this cavity sometimes is almost closed or
  arched over in its upper part In one specimen the basal margin of
  the scutum was deeply hollowed out in the middle The Tergum is
  remarkably narrow with its apex produced into a triangular beak
  hollow within and sometimes faintly tinged purple A deep closed
  longitudinal furrow runs down the valve The spur is long remarkably
  narrow and pointed Internally the spur is produced up the valve
  as a ridge the inflected scutal margin and the prominent articular
  ridge are both nearly straight and parallel to the spur The crests
  for the depressores are sharp and very prominent

  The Parietes are very thick and strong unlike every other
  species of the genus they consist of several very irregular rows
  of unequally sized round or angular tubes  b These tubes or
  pores are generally short and are at frequent intervals crossed by
  transverse septa they often rather deserve to be called cells than
  tubes New tubes are formed along the inner as well as along the
  outer lamina They are lined by dusky purple corium The internal
  surface of the parietes is smooth in the upper part and in the
  lower it is reticulated by slight irregularly branching ridges
  The carinal internal margin of each compartment projects a little
  as in the case of B crenatus and balanoides The lower edge of
  the sheath is either hollow beneath or is united to the walls The
  radii in one specimen were broad with slightly oblique jagged
  summits generally they are extremely narrow forming more ribbons
  along the lower edges of the compartments barely extending up as
  high as the sheath They can sometimes hardly or not at all be
  seen until the shell is disarticulated in rather young specimens
  the sutural edge is sometimes quite smooth in old specimens the
  lower part of the edge has coarse arborescent septa with the
  interspaces filled up solidly whilst the upper part is smooth
  The al are conspicuous from the outside owing to the little
  development of the radii but owing to the diametric growth not
  having been great the part added during such growth is narrow
  the summits of the al are only slightly oblique the sutural edge
  is coarsely crenated with the teeth denticulated or slightly
  arborescent

  Basis membranous

  Mouth labrum with only four very minute teeth mandibles with four
  teeth the third tooth broader than the first the fourth small
  Maxill with the two upper spines placed on a slight prominence
  beneath which there is a small notch Cirri of a very dark colour
  much injured the segments of the first second and third pairs
  very broad and short protuberant in front and most thickly clothed
  with spines the third pair is very little longer than the second
  pair the sixth pair in a large specimen above one inch in basal
  diameter had the segments broader than long each furnished with
  seven pairs of spines

  AffinitiesThis species though very distinct evidently comes
  near to B balanoides especially to var a By merely
  doubling or trebling the irregular rows of short tubes in the
  walls of B balanoides with their reticulated inner lamina and
  longitudinally folded outer lamina we should have the structure
  exhibited in B cariosus We have seen also that in var
  a of B balanoides the spur of the tergum is remarkably
  sharp as in B cariosus This species also in a very marked
  manner approaches in many characters especially in the opercular
  valves in the cirri and to a certain extent in the shell and
  basis to B flosculus and even in external appearance to var
  sordidus of the latteran inhabitant of the opposite extremity
  of the continent namely of Tierra del Fuego Again the tergum
  to a certain extent and the scutum in a singular manner resemble
  these valves in B nubilus showing an unequivocal affinity to
  that species With respect to the most remarkable character of the
  species namely the several irregular rows of tubes or pores in the
  walls it deserves notice that in B crenatus which is certainly
  closely allied to B balanoides the longitudinal septa sometimes
  divide near the outer lamina thus giving rise to a few additional
  tubes Of the above several species to which our present species is
  allied B flosculus stands in the next section and B nubilus
  and crenatus in the last hence we see that B cariosus has
  singularly divergent affinities The peculiar structure of the
  parietes together with the general appearance of the shell made me
  at the first moment suppose I was examining a Tetraclita or Conia of
  Leach hence also it has arisen that Lepas cariosa of Pallas
  has often been quite erroneously given as a synonym of Tetraclita
  porosa




 BALANUS DECLIVIS Pl  fig  a d

Parietes solid rostrum nearly twice as long as the carina or
carinolateral compartments hence the basis is oblique Tergum with
the spur truncated half as wide as the valve

  HabWest Indies Mus BritJamaica imbedded in a sponge Mus
  Cuming


This is a remarkable species when first seeing it imbedded in numbers
in a sponge I did not in the least doubt but that it was an Acasta
on examination however it is found to have a membranous basis and
therefore cannot by the definition enter into that subgenus to which
however it is very closely allied It differs from other sessile
cirripedes very remarkably in the rostrum being nearly twice as long as
the carinal compartments so that the basis is always very oblique or
placed almost on one side in this elongation of the rostrum although
in a different direction we are reminded of B calceolus and its
allies and these latter we know can hardly be separated from certain
species of Acasta Hence the position of our present species in this
section is not natural but I am unable to place it elsewhere without
breaking down every definition it should stand somewhat isolated
on one side of a line of affinity connecting Balanus calceolus and
navicula with Acasta purpurata


  General AppearanceThe shell is thin fragile smooth and
  white but covered to a considerable extent by a brown membrane
  which on the sheath and opercular valve is of a bright tint and
  clothed with bristles Viewed laterally the rostrum is seen to
  be considerably bowed and from its being nearly twice as long as
  the other compartments with its lower end bluntly pointed the
  basal margin of the whole shell is rendered very oblique forming a
  slightly concave line The lateral compartments are rather longer
  and about one third broader than the carinolateral compartments
  The rostrum from terminating downwards in a blunt point instead
  of being square or truncated as in all other Cirripedes and from
  the upper end being as is usual pointed has when disarticulated
  from the other compartments the shape of a boat The parietes are
  not at all porose their internal surface sometimes shows traces
  of longitudinal ribs but sometimes there are none The radii are
  narrow with their summits very oblique and their sutural edges
  smooth The sutural edges of the al are likewise smooth The largest
  of Mr Cumings specimens was  of an inch in diameter but a
  disarticulated specimen in the British Museum must have been larger
  having a rostrum  in length The Basis is membranous

  The Scuta are rather convex they have their lines of growth
  approximate most finely crenated so as to be very feebly striated
  longitudinally Internally the articular ridge is pretty well
  developed its lower edge being very oblique there is barely an
  adductor ridge the pit for the lateral depressor muscle is deep
  The spur of the Tergum is placed close to the basiscutal angle
  of the valve it is about half as wide as the valve with the
  lower end truncated sometimes it may be rather said to be bluntly
  pointed owing to its carinal side sloping up to the basal margin
  The articular ridge is pretty well developed The crests for the
  depressor muscles are barely discernible

  Animals body unknown

    For the reference to Ascanius work which is on the binomial

  General appearanceShell tubuloconical very smooth white
  generally more or less covered by yellow thin membrane orifice
  large subtriangular radii moderately broad with their more
  or less oblique summits slightly rounded and smooth from this
  circumstance the shell has been justly compared to the halfopened
  flower of a white tulip Specimens often exceed an inch in basal
  diameter I have seen one from Scarborough two inches in diameter
  and one and three quarters in height another specimen was  in
  diameter and  in height The specimens in the glacial deposits seem
  even to have acquired larger dimensions one from Uddevalla being
  nearly four inches in height

  Scuta elongated flat feebly striated longitudinally
  internally articular ridge short moderately prominent adductor
  ridge confluent in the upper part with the articular ridge
  running straight down and forming a rather large cavity for the
  lateral depressor Terga feebly striated longitudinally with a
  longitudinal furrow having the sides in old specimens partly
  closed in the basal margin slopes much towards the spur which is
  rather long and narrow with its end rounded it is placed at about
  its own width from the basiscutal angle Internally articular
  furrow narrow crests for the depressores moderately prominent but
  in a variable degree

  Compartments these are unusually thin and separate easily the
  parietes are finely ribbed longitudinally on their insides the
  bases of these ribs being just perceptibly denticulated Radii
  with their summits oblique usually at about an angle of 
  slightly arched and quite smooth the smoothness is produced by the
  edge being a little inflected sutural edge quite smooth without
  even a trace of septa or denticuli Al oblique generally rather
  less oblique than the summits of the radii sutural edges smooth
  with an excessively fine linear furrow running along the edge a
  little towards the inner side and filled with a yellow ligamentous
  substance a furrow of this kind I have seen in no other species

  Basis solid not permeated by pores either smooth or slightly
  furrowed in lines radiating from the centre

  Mouth labrum with scarcely perceptible minute beadlike teeth
  thinly scattered along the edge Palpi and outer maxill rather
  sparingly clothed with hairs Mandibles with teeth rather sharp
  the fourth and fifth teeth small but well developed inferior angle
  pointed with fine spines Maxill with a deep notch under the two
  upper great spines Cirri the first pair is short with rami of
  nearly equal length the segments are not protuberant in front either
  in the first or second pairs In the posterior cirri the segments
  bear four pairs of spines with a tuft of rather long intermediate
  spines in young specimens there are only three pairs the spines in
  the dorsal tufts are short and thin

  When the shell is disarticulated this species cannot be confounded
  with any other but judging by external characters alone it may
  sometimes be very easily confounded with B eburneus and I have
  received the two species under this one name from Massachussetts
  generally B Hameri may be distinguished from B eburneus by
  the smoothness of the summits of its radii and by the socalled
  epidermis being of a darker yellow

  With respect to the fossil specimens from the glacial deposits
  I have little to add I have seen one from Uddevalla as already
  remarked four inches in height and a lateral compartment broader by
  one fourth than the same compartment in any recent specimen As Sir
  C Lyell remarks Phil Transact the compartments are always found
  separated which is accounted for by their weak union in a recent
  state This species when fossil is usually associated with its
  deepwater congeners B porcatus and crenatus as at the present
  day

  I must here mention that I have examined a considerable number of
  separated compartments without opercular valves brought from
  Barbados in the West Indies showing the existence there of a
  closely allied or possibly identical species The only difference
  which I can point out in these compartments is that the parietes
  are rather thicker and the radii rather narrower with more oblique
  summits some of the compartments are two inches in length It seems
  very improbable that the true B Hameri should extend to the West
  Indies but after what has been seen in the case of B crenatus
  this is possible

  surface very smooth white longitudinally banded with pinkish or
  leaden purple with sometimes a purplish sometimes a yellowish tint
  the latter owing to the persistent epidermis the bands are pale
  and often fade away in the lower and sometimes in other parts of
  the shell the epidermis is generally more persistent on the narrow
  rounded radii than on the parietes and hence the radii are generally
  yellowish The opercular valves are pale dull purple the sheath is
  darker purple with the exception of the portions of the al added
  during the diametric growth which are of a dead white and are
  externally conspicuous The scuta are striated longitudinally I
  may remark that excepting the narrowness of the radii with their
  quite smooth rounded and very oblique summits some specimens are
  hardly distinguishable in external aspect from varieties of B
  amphitrite If the specimens from the northeast coast of Australia
  of which I have seen many but unfortunately only one small one had
  its opercular valves form as I fully believe merely a variety it
  is characterised by its nearly uniform beautiful rosy pink without
  any distinct longitudinal bands of these specimens I have seen
  one two inches in basal diameter and three in height of ordinary
  dullercoloured striped specimens the largest was  in basal
  diameter Of the perfectly white var b I have seen several
  specimens the largest being  of an inch in diameter these have
  a somewhat peculiar aspect but I have met with only one specimen
  with opercular valves and that was extremely young I at first
  considered this form as specifically distinct but I can point out
  after careful examination of the whole shell operculum and internal
  animal of the young specimen no sufficient diagnostic characters

  the prominent lines of growth into squarish beads internally the
  upper part of the valve is roughened the articular ridge is short
  remarkably little prominent and not reflexed the adductor ridge
  is blunt and little prominent sometimes it is almost confluent
  with the articular ridge there is a deep but variable depression

  like the parietes have no inner lamina the recipient grooves in

  the shell of unusual depth The al differently from the radii
  generally have their summits very slightly oblique but sometimes
  they are highly oblique their sutural edges are most finely
  crenated The basis is generally flat sometimes cupformed it is
  permeated by pores crossed by transverse septa and sometimes there
  is an underlying cancellated layer

tergum with the spur extremely short truncated broad as half the
valve

  HabRaines Islet Barrier Reef Australia Mus Stutchbury Hab
  unknown attached to and coated by Porites Mus Brit


  General AppearanceShell conical smooth but with the lower part
  sometimes narrowly ribbed in lines corresponding with the internal
  longitudinal ribs tinted pale peachblossom purple owing to the
  sheath being finely so coloured or wholly white Radii broad white
  square on the summit hence orifice entire ovate passing into
  rhomboidal The parietal portion of the carinolateral compartments
  extremely narrow about one eighth of the width of the parietes of
  the lateral compartments Basis concave partially imbedded in the
  coral Largest specimen  of an inch in diameter

  There are some specimens in Mr Cumings collection which appear to
  belong to this species and are certainly very closely allied to it
  but not having the opercula cannot be identified positively the
  shell is flatter with the walls strongly ribbed up to the orifice
  which is more rhomboidal the basis is much more cupformed and more
  deeply imbedded in the coral but these differences by themselves are
  by no means sufficiently diagnostic

  Scutum the lines of growth are crenated causing the surface to
  be very obscurely striated longitudinally the articular ridge is
  very prominent as can be best seen from the outside and runs down
  the whole length of the tergal margin with a very regular curve and
  hence differs from the articular ridge in the foregoing species The
  adductor ridge is either absent or very indistinct and parallel
  to the articular ridge there is a deep little pit for the lateral
  depressor muscle Tergum  d with the apex somewhat produced
  or beaked and tinged purple external surface almost flat without
  any longitudinal furrow scutal margin curved Spur very short
  placed quite close to the basiscutal angle of the valve broad as
  half the valve lower end square Internally the articular ridge is
  prominent only in the uppermost part of the valve crests for the
  depressores very feeble

  Parietes their internal surface is very strongly ribbed
  longitudinally the ribs being coarsely denticulated at their bases
  and finely fluted along their sides The sheath is transversely
  ribbed and clothed with an epidermis furnished with transverse
  rows of fine hairs The radii are of a dead white whereas the
  parietes are translucent the summits are parallel to the basis
  they are broad the radii of the carinolateral compartments appear
  extraordinarily broad owing to the narrowness of the parietal
  portion the sutural edges are furnished with coarse septa which
  are sinuous irregular and obtusely denticulated the interspaces
  are filled up solidly The al are thin with their sutural edges
  almost smooth and their summits oblique in some specimens during
  the diametric growth a mere almost threadlike ribbon is added
  to their sutural edges Basis slightly cup or saucershaped
  moderately thick permeated by fine pores and generally ribbed in
  lines radiating from the centre The walls and basis adhere together
  very firmly

  Mouth labrum with six teeth mandibles with five teeth the three
  upper teeth being sharp narrow and unusually prominent the two
  lower teeth minute and sharp maxill without a notch Cirri much
  injured first pair with one ramus apparently one third longer than
  the other segments not very protuberant the posterior cirri have
  elongated segments with five pairs of spines

  AffinitiesThis species is very distinct from all the foregoing
  in the carinolateral compartments being so narrow and tending as
  we may suppose to become aborted in the form and structure of the
  whole shell and in its habits this species shows an affinity and
  passage to the coralinhabiting subgenus Creusia which has only
  four compartments There is also a close affinity to the subgenus
  Acasta This species is so closely allied to the following that
  I at one time felt some doubts whether they ought to have been
  specifically separated it is also probably closely allied to B
  terebratus but the materials hardly suffice for judgment it is
  also related though less obviously to B vestitus

obscurely porose Scutum with the lines of growth crenated tergum with
the spur truncated broad as half the valve and depending beneath the
basiscutal angle as much as half its own breadth

  HabJapan attached to an Isis Mus Cuming Attached to an
  oyster Mus Stutchbury


As already stated this species comes in all essential respects very
near to the last though differing much in appearance I have seen
two sets of specimens and two sets of B allium and there was no
variability or passage in the points in which they differed hence I
must consider them as specifically distinct


  Shell steeply conical strongly but bluntly ribbed longitudinally
  coloured either all over dull reddish purple or with the upper part
  only pinkish purple in one set of specimens the yellow epidermis
  was partially persistent Radii narrow Orifice small ovate The
  wall of the carinolateral compartment is very narrow The internal
  surface of the parietes is ribbed but finely and only in the lower
  part The septa on the sutural edges of the radii are finer than in
  B allium Basis flat obscurely permeated by pores The largest
  specimen is  of an inch in basal diameter

  Scuta these are longitudinally and finely striated the
  basitergal corner is more rounded off than in B allium and the
  articular ridge is not nearly so prominent internally the adductor
  ridge is rather more prominent The Tergum is rather broader its
  apex is produced into a minute sharp point the scutal margin is
  straight the spur is broader and measured from the basiscutal
  angle of the valve considerably longer namely as long as half
  the width of the basal margin of the spur whereas in B allium
  it is only about a quarter as long as the basal margin of the spur
  the lower edge of the spur is not here so directly transverse to
  the longitudinal axis of the valve as in B allium the external
  surface is not so flat as in that species and a depression runs down
  to the basiscutal angle of the spur


Considering the difference in the shape and appearance of the shell
with its narrow radii and small orifice considering the less strongly
ribbed internal lamina of the parietes the finer septa on the sutural
edges of the radii the slight difference in outline in the scuta and
terga more especially the greater length of the spur I conceive I am
right in ranking this form as a distinct species though assuredly it
is very closely allied to B allium and even still closer to the
following B quadrivittatus




 BALANUS QUADRIVITTATUS Pl  fig

  Brit and Stutchbury and Darwin Philippine Archipelago attached to

I have seen four sets of specimens of this species taken in four
different places one set containing above twenty individuals and
all resembled each other exactly nevertheless this species comes so
close to B cepa that I am somewhat doubtful about its specific
distinctness


  General AppearanceShell smooth or slightly folded steeply
  conical white with four longitudinal bands of pale brownishgray
  colour namely on the rostrum the carina and the two lateral
  compartments the carinolateral compartments are very narrow and
  almost white the four brownishgray bands are darkest in the upper
  part of the shell though always rather faint and die out towards
  the base they can sometimes be seen to be formed of several narrow
  longitudinal stripes the tint shows a trace of containing purple
  The orifice of the shell is small rhomboidal and not quite entire
  owing to the obliquity of the summits of the moderately broad radii
  In structure the shell radii and al resemble those in the last
  species The basis however does not appear to be permeated by
  pores Basal diameter of largest specimen  of an inch

  The Scuta most closely resemble those of B cepa but the lines
  of growth are not crenated and internally there is only a very
  minute pit for the lateral depressor muscle placed almost on the
  edge itself of the valve The Tergum hardly differs at all from
  that of B cepa but is perhaps of rather greater breadth

  The Mouth does not differ from that in the last two species In the
  Cirri the three posterior pairs have elongated segments bearing
  only three pairs of spines of which the lowest pair is minute in
  B allium and I believe in B cepa there are five pairs of
  spines on each segment


This species differs from the last only in the peculiar colouring
smoother walls more oblique radii solid basis and more especially
in the scuta having the lines of growth not crenated and internally
in the pit for the lateral depressor muscle being so very minute and
placed on the basitergal edge of the valve The posterior cirri
also I believe differ in the number of the spines which the segments
support nevertheless I cannot feel confident about the specific
distinctness of B quadrivittatus




 BALANUS TEREBRATUS Pl  fig  a b

produced into long points basis concave not permeated by pores but

double rows

  HabUnknown Brit Mus attached to a lamelliferous coral


I have in this instance broken through my rule of not describing a
Cirripede without examining the opercular valves but the species here
named is so peculiar that it would have been a fault to have passed it
over There is but a single specimen in the British Museum without as
just stated the operculum and of course without the animals body


  Shell white depressed conical somewhat elongated in its
  rostrocarinal axis orifice rather small pentagonal toothed
  elongated Parietes rather thin with extremely prominent
  longitudinal ribs produced at the basal edge into long spikes the
  internal surface is also ribbed but less strongly than the outside
  Radii rather narrow with oblique not smooth summits sutural edges
  very finely and obscurely crenated Al with their summits extremely
  oblique Lower edge of sheath closely attached to the walls The
  carinolateral compartments are rather narrow

  Basis slightly concave or saucershaped the circumference
  is produced into long spikes corresponding with those on the
  basal margin of the parietes these projections equal half the
  semidiameter of the shell The internal surface of the basis has
  slightly prominent rounded ridges and the external surface has
  extraordinarily prominent sharp ridges radiating from the centre
  the edges of the external ridges are irregular notched and knobbed
  I have seen in no other species external ridges on the basis or
  surface of attachment and what is more remarkable the interspaces
  between the ridges are penetrated by small rounded apertures of
  irregular shape and unequal sizes and these are generally arranged
  in an irregular double row and externally are closed by the
  membrane which clothes the basis In the subgenus Acasta the basal
  cup is sometimes penetrated by similar holes but these seem never
  to extend over the whole basis and are very variable nevertheless
  in some specimens of Acasta spongites from the Cape of Good Hope
  portions of the basis closely resembled except in the absence of
  the radiating ridges the structure here described but the holes
  were not arranged in any definite order The internal surface of
  the parietes in Acasta sporillus presents a somewhat analogous
  appearance but the pits do not penetrate through the walls This
  species I have no doubt is closely allied to the subgenus Acasta
  and to Balanus navicula with its allies and but much less
  closely to B allium with its allies Indeed had B terebratus
  inhabited a sponge I should have been compelled to have ranked it in
  the subgenus Acasta

radii represented by mere fissures basis solid Scutum with a sharp
curved adductor ridge with crests for the lateral depressor muscle

  HabNew Zealand New South Wales Mus Brit and Stutchbury
  attached to shells


  General AppearanceShape conical often steeply conical orifice
  small radii not developed represented by mere fissures The walls
  are smooth or slightly or strongly ribbed longitudinally The shell
  itself is of a fine peachblossom pink or nearly white but it is
  generally covered by a thick yellow or brownishorange epidermis
  Opercular valves pinkish but similarly covered Basal diameter of
  largest specimen  of an inch

  Scuta with the lines of growth closely approximate surface
  somewhat convex Internally the articular ridge is very little
  prominent but runs far down the tergal margin in some specimens
  however it is shorter and more prominent The adductor ridge is
  strongly prominent is curved towards the rostral angle and runs
  down nearly to the basal margin The rostral depressor muscle is
  lodged in a small cavity formed as usual by the overlapping of
  the occludent margin within this cavity there are either tolerably
  distinct little crests or merely traces of them for the attachment
  of the muscle The lateral depressor muscle is attached to several
  quite distinct crests seated in a concavity beneath the adductor
  ridge Tergum rather narrow with the apex produced or beaked the
  beak is purplish and flat There is a slight rounded longitudinal
  furrow or depression The spur is fully one third of the width of
  the valve it is short with the end truncated and placed close to
  the basiscutal angle the basal margin on the carinal side slopes
  gently towards the spur Internally the scutal margin is scarcely at
  all inflected and the articular ridge is very little prominent the
  crests for the tergal depressores are pretty well developed

  From the points here enumerated it is clear that the opercular
  valves are articulated together much less strongly than is usual with
  most species excepting B allium and its allies It is remarkable
  that in this species the terga are united to the sheath not as is
  usual by a single opercular membrane but by five or six one above
  the other the upper membranes not having been exuviated as each new
  lower one was formed The minute spines on the membrane lining the
  sheath are rather larger and more numerous than is usual and to the
  base of each spine a tubulus of unusual diameter runs imbedded in
  the shell

  The Walls internally have unusually numerous narrow
  approximate strongly prominent longitudinal ribs denticulated at
  their bases and inserted into the furrows on the borders of the
  basis in old specimens these internal ribs die out in the upper
  part of the walls The Radii are not developed in any of the many
  specimens which I have seen and the edges of the compartments on
  both sides of each suture are equally marked by slight irregular
  ridges or knobs answering to the septa and their recipient furrows
  in the species with ordinarily developed radii There is very little
  diametric growth the orifice being gradually enlarged by the
  disintegration of the upper ends of the walls the al however
  in some specimens do grow a little along their lateral or sutural
  edges so that some little diametric growth must be effected The
  summits of the al are very oblique their sutural edges are plainly
  crenated The sheath descends about half way down the walls The
  Basis is flat not permeated by pores but deeply furrowed in lines
  radiating from the centre

  Mouth labrum sometimes with no teeth sometimes with four minute
  teeth mandibles with four teeth of which the third is blunt and
  rather large the fourth is a mere knob Maxill there is as usual
  an upper pair of large spines beneath which there is sometimes
  a small notch but all the lower spines instead of standing as
  usual in pairs form a single row Cirri first pair with the rami
  remarkably unequal in length one ramus having twentytwo segments
  and being more than twice the length of the other having only nine
  segments these segments and likewise those of the second and third
  pairs have an inverted conical shape and they are all less thickly
  clothed with spines than is usual The second pair is short about as
  long as the shorter ramus of the first pair and has ten or twelve
  segments The third pair is above twice as long as the second pair
  and contains twentyfour segments this very unusual length is owing
  to the presence of numerous thin tapering upper segments unlike
  those generally found in Balanus in the third pair of cirri and
  apparently serving as feelers These upper tapering segments are
  of an inverted conical shape and support on their upper margins
  two very small tufts of spines one behind and one in front on the
  segments lower down these tufts increase in size and the spines are
  more spread out so that in the basal segments the tufts in front
  form on the upper margin two or three crowded rows of bristles The
  three posterior pairs of cirri have elongated segments which bear
  on their upper half three pairs of spines of these the lowest pair
  is minute and the middle pair is only one third of the length of
  the upper pair The sixth cirrus in the same individual as before
  contained twentyseven segments in each ramus that is only three
  more than in the third cirrus I must observe that the cirri in
  all the specimens were irregular often distorted and monstrous
  and therefore probably there is considerable variation in the
  proportional numbers of the segments in the cirri

  At the base of the penis there is a minute knifeedged triangular
  projection The branchi are rather narrow pointed and not very
  large

  AffinitiesThis is a very distinct species as shown by the
  peculiarities in the cirri by the absence of radii to the shell
  and by the presence of crests for the attachment of the lateral
  scutal depressores With the exception of this latter character the
  opercular valves clearly show that B vestitus is allied to B
  allium cepa and quadrivittatus In some respects this species
  manifests an affinity to B imperator which latter has its third
  pair of cirri nearly similar to those of B vestitus

  high up the valve there is hardly an adductor ridge but the surface
  of the valve is angularly prominent in a curved line running from
  the articular ridge to near the rostral angle of the valve At the
  rostral angle the occludent margin is not folded inwards as is
  generally the case but the surface is flat and is marked by four

  AffinitiesThis noble Balanus in all the characters derived
  from its opercular valves and from its cirri is closely allied to
  the last species in the structure however of the shell and of
  the basis it comes closer to the following B flosculus The
  crests on the under side of the scutum for the lateral depressores
  are confined to these three species and the crests for the rostral
  depressores are confined to B imperator and vestitus but they
  are generally rudimentary in the latter The internal basal structure
  of the parietes is singularly like that of Chelonobia caretta
  though there is no other special affinity to that genus In the
  nature of basis in the structure to a certain limited extent of
  the walls of the shell in the narrowness of the carinolateral
  compartments in the elongation of the third pair of cirri in the
  crests for the rostral and lateral scutal depressores B imperator
  comes nearer to the genus Tetraclita than does any other species of
  Balanus

  irregular or globuloconical or more rarely cylindrical and
  elongated Walls either with a few rather broad smooth irregular
  longitudinal folds or in var sordidus with numerous sharper
  and more prominent longitudinal ridges basal margin very sinuous
  Colour either fine rich peachblossom purple or so pale as to be
  almost white or in var sordidus dirty white generally stained
  greenish from confervoid matter Orifice small oval entire Radii
  very narrow white or not at all developed and with even the
  sutures not distinguishable The purple coloured varieties with
  the narrow white radii the small oval orifice and folded walls
  have a very pretty appearance which is far from the case with var
  sordidus The largest specimens attained a basal diameter of 
  of an inch but this is an unusual size I have seen a cylindrical
  specimen of var sordidus one inch in length

  The opercular valves are united to the sheath by unusually strong
  membrane internally their upper parts are stained purple Scuta
  these vary considerably in breadth some being even broader than in
  Pl  fig  c and others as much elongated as in fig  d
  these latter come from an elongated cylindrical shell The valve
  externally is unusually convex the apex also projects freely to
  an unusual degree Internally the articular ridge is moderately
  prominent the adductor ridge is prominent and much curved in the
  upper part it either lies close to or at some little distance from
  the articular ridge The lateral depressores are attached to several
  little crests occupying a cavity often bordered above by a little
  ridge close beneath the adductor ridge Tergum extraordinarily
  narrow and elongated beak triangular purple a longitudinal furrow
  runs down the valve spur narrow long bluntly pointed lying close
  to the basiscutal angle of the valve the scutal margin is nearly
  straight and parallel to the spur Internally the articular ridge
  is prominent the crests for the depressores are moderately well
  developed the upper part of the valve is marked by a purple patch
  bounded on one side by the articular ridge and on the other side
  by a very slight special ridge There is some variability in the
  narrowness of the whole valve and in the sharpness of the spur

  ParietesThe under surface in the more depressed varieties is
  roughened in a remarkable manner nearly or quite up to the sheath
  with very irregular projecting and branching ridges and sometimes
  with depending points These ridges and points are granulated on
  their under surfaces The roughened surface in the more conical
  varieties is confined to the basal inner margin This structure is
  nearly the same as that in B imperator represented Pl  fig
   c but the little ridges are here more apt to be concentric
  instead of radiating The lateral edges of the compartments on the
  inside especially the carinal edges project inwards beyond the
  inner surface of the shell The sheath is but little hollow on its
  under side The diametric growth of the shell seems to be quite
  capricious in the same group some individuals thus increasing and
  others not at all When the radii are developed they are narrow and
  white with their upper margins nearly if not quite parallel to the
  basis their sutural edges are formed by large irregular branching
  teeth or septa The al also have their sutural edges coarsely
  crenated and when the shell increases by diametric growth they are
  added to above the opercular membrane so as to be nearly square at
  top

  BasisWhen a shell is removed from the surface of attachment
  and inspected even under a lens there appears to be no basis
  whatever either adhering to the shell or to the supporting surface
  but when a more careful examination is made with a higher power
  an excessively thin translucent calcareous irregular layer or
  rather film can almost always be discovered This would be more
  easily distinguished if the specimens had adhered to rock instead of
  to the rugged shells of molluscs At one time I thought the basis
  was partially membranous for I have certainly scraped off small
  fragments of membrane from the supporting surface but these when
  examined under the compound microscope seemed always to consist of a
  thin sheet of the yellow cementing tissue and in some instances a
  brittle film of shell representing the true basis of the cirripede
  still adhered to the upper surface of the membranous bits of cement
  Nevertheless so imperfect is the calcareous basis that I should not
  be surprised if portions of a true membranous basis did really in
  some cases exist

  Mouth labrum with the notch wide generally with a few little
  teeth mandibles with three teeth and some inferior knobs maxill
  notched Cirri first pair with one ramus shorter by three segments
  than the other ramus Second and third pairs short of nearly
  equal length thickly clothed with spines segments very little
  protuberant Posterior cirri having elongated segments supporting
  seven pairs of spines

  Var sordidusThis form is very common on the tidal shores of
  the Strait of Magellan and of the southernmost parts of Tierra del
  Fuego near Cape Horn it lives attached to rocks mytili and logs
  of wood and is associated with Chthamalus scabrosus It almost
  certainly is the most antarctic form of the genus Balanus If I were
  guided by external appearance alone I should certainly separate
  this form specifically from B flosculus but as will be seen in
  the following description the differences consist only in var
  sordidus being much duller and rather differently coloured in the
  longitudinal folds being sharper and more prominent and in the whole
  shell being rather more globular and on an average rather larger
  but in the true B flosculus there is considerable variation in
  all these respects as there likewise is in var sordidus thus
  some of the cylindrical varieties of the latter have less prominent
  ridges than even B flosculus In general appearance I have seen
  some nearly but not exactly intermediate forms therefore I do
  not feel positive that these forms may not be specifically distinct
  but have failed after careful examination to find any sufficient
  diagnostic characters Moreover in the case of Balanus lvis
  I was led to believe that there is an equal and somewhat analogous
  amount of variation in the specimens inhabiting Tierra del Fuego and
  northern Chile and in this case I was enabled to show the existence
  of strictly intermediate forms in the intermediate districts

  The shell in var sordidus is generally globuloconical dirty
  white frequently with a green tinge from the growth of confervoid
  matter Orifice small The exterior surface is covered with numerous
  prominent narrow sharp ribs or folds the basal margin being
  serrated with projecting points where the folds terminate When
  the radii are not developed the sutures are very often obscure
  Internally the shell is faintly tinted of a portwine purple In
  all points of structure this form is identical with the true B
  flosculus In some few specimens the whole exterior surface was
  disintegrated and smooth and this is generally the case with the
  upper parts of the shell Some other specimens which had grown
  crowded together on wood had become cylindrical and consequently
  the orifice was as large in diameter as the shell namely half an
  inch in some of these cylindrical varieties the sheath was entirely
  soldered to the walls The largest specimens which I have seen were
   of an inch in diameter and above one inch in height

  AffinitiesThis species in its opercular valves even in such
  trifling characters as the strength of the opercular membrane
  and in its cirri approaches closely to B cariosus We even
  see on the under side of the scutum in that species a single
  little ridge foreshadowing as it were the crests for the lateral
  scutal depressores so remarkable in our present species In the
  structure of the shell and of the basis B flosculus is much
  more closely related to the last species or B imperator If it
  had been possible to have arranged the species in a single line

     I am indebted to M Bosquet for a specimen bearing this
    name and reference found in the Systeme Bolderien of Dumont
    miocene according to Sir C Lyell at Bolderberg The specimen
    consists of a rostrum with a portion of the base attached and as
    these parts are in some degree characteristic I fully believe this
    specimen to be the B bisulcatus I hope hereafter to give in
    the Palontographical Series fuller illustrations of this and the
    following fossil species

Radii with their upper margins oblique and smooth sutural edges
smooth basis permeated by large pores Scutum narrow with from two to
four longitudinal furrows tergum with the spur very short broad as
half the valve

  Var plicatus with the walls deeply folded radii narrow with
  their upper margins very oblique

  General AppearanceShell conical or tubuloconical often rather
  globose walls frequently thin either very smooth or deeply
  plicated longitudinally occasionally the same specimen is smooth
  in the upper part and strongly plicated in the lower The Radii in
  the larger specimens are wide and with their upper margins only
  slightly oblique in the smaller they are narrower and much more
  oblique but in each case their upper margins are smooth and slightly
  bowed Colour apparently originally nearly white but with the al
  generally in the smaller specimens clouded with a dark tint
  the radii are usually striped feebly in longitudinal lines Basal
  diameter of largest specimen  of an inch but this seems to have
  been an unusual size

  Scuta narrow with the basal margin forming an unusually small
  angle with the occludent margin surface slightly convex with lines
  of growth approximate moderately prominent on the tergal half
  of the valve two distinct rather broad furrows with sometimes a
  third and even a fourth nearer to the occludent margin Pl 
  fig  a extend from the apex down the valve and give it a very
  peculiar appearance the furrows near the tergal margin are the
  deepest Internally the upper part of the valve is roughened with
  small points the articular furrow is unusually wide the articular
  ridge is very prominent and but little reflexed with the lower end
  almost abruptly cut off the adductor ridge is prominent but short
  there are small deepish pits for the rostral and lateral depressores

  Terga  b broad flat with a slight narrow prominent rim
  along the scutal margin which margin is slightly bowed The basal
  margin on the carinal side of the spur slopes so gradually towards
  the spur that the latter is barely distinct and is very short not
  depending nearly half its own width beneath the basiscutal angle it
  is broad namely measured across the upper part as broad as half
  the valve its basal end is obliquely rounded off on the carinal
  side it is placed close to the basiscutal angle The carinal
  margin of the valve is just perceptibly bowed and is formed by
  rectangularly upturned lines of growth Internally the upper part of
  the valve is rough the articular ridge is prominent the crests for
  the tergal depressor muscles are moderately welldeveloped

  Parietes not porose internally the ribs are smooth with their
  basal edges very finely or barely denticulated The radii as
  already stated are of variable breadth they have their upper
  margins either very slightly or highly oblique but always smooth and
  rounded their sutural edges are quite smooth or sometimes with
  a strong lens traces of transverse stri representing septa can
  just be discovered The al have their upper margins very oblique
  their sutural edges are in the large specimens quite smooth in the
  younger ones plainly crenated the recipient furrow being clearly
  marked with these teeth Basis plainly porose

  VarietiesIt is certain that there are longitudinally plicated
  specimens of this species and that the obliquity of the upper
  margins of the radii also varies a little nevertheless some of the
  deeply plicated specimens undoubtedly have a very different aspect
  from the ordinary varieties and do really differ in the sutural
  edges of the al being crenated and in the greater narrowness and
  obliquity of the radii but these points are all commonly variable
  I have not seen any large specimens of the variety plicatus so
  as to compare them with the large specimens of the normal form yet
  I can hardly entertain any doubt considering their agreement in
  so many important points that I have rightly treated these forms
  as mere varieties it is unfortunate that none of the specimens of
  the var plicatus seen by me have had opercular valves as their
  presence would have removed all shadow of doubt

  Affinities this is a strongly characterised species and nearly
  allied only to the following species B dolosus The furrows on
  the scuta in some degree resemble those on B lvis but there is
  no alliance with that species It is certain that amongst recent
  species the chief affinity is with B Hameri and amaryllis




 BALANUS DOLOSUS Pl  fig

short broad as one third of valve

  Postwick near Norwich Mus Lyell


This species so closely resembles B bisulcatus both externally and
in all the essential characters of the parietes radii and basis
that it is quite superfluous to describe over again these parts The
specific characters are derived from the opercular valves which
present well defined distinctions found by me constant in several
specimens of both species B dolosus like B bisulcatus has
quite smooth and deeply plicated varieties often adhering to the same
univalve The ribs on the inner surfaces of the parietes are remarkably
prominent I think the upper margins of the radii are in this species
rather more oblique than in B bisulcatus The sutural edges of the
radii are marked by the finest stri representing septa The sutural
edges of the al are generally distinctly crenated The basis is often
slightly cupformed and very plainly porose its surface is marked by
radiating ridges The orifice of the shell is large and elongated
especially in young specimens The basal diameter of the largest
specimen is  of an inch


  The Scuta have no trace of the two or three longitudinal furrows so
  conspicuous on these valves in B bisulcatus and which in that
  species run down from the apex of the valve this fact showing that
  the furrows occur in quite young individuals The whole valve is not
  quite so narrow as in B bisulcatus but otherwise agrees with it
  in shape internally there is hardly any difference the articular
  furrow is not so wide the articular ridge is very prominent and
  abruptly truncated at its lower end the adductor ridge is also
  prominent it here runs a little higher up the valve than in B
  bisulcatus The Tergum differs more in the two species the spur
  is not so broad measured in its upper part it is only about one
  third of the entire width of the valve instead of being half as
  wide as the valve it is considerably longer depending beneath the
  basiscutal angle more than half its own width the basal margin of
  the valve on the carinal side does not slope so gradually into the
  spur the occludent and carinal margins are slightly arched as in
  B bisulcatus Internally the surface is rough the articular
  ridge is prominent and the crests for the tergal depressores are
  well developedall as in B bisulcatus It is remarkable how
  generally the opercular valves have been preserved in this species
  in its fossil condition as compared with most other species of the
  genus


It is not easy to distinguish by external characters the rugged
varieties of this species from B crenatus indeed the only
difference is that the furrows receiving the edges of the radii
generally exhibit in B crenatus a slight impression of the septa
which are entirely absent in B dolosus By internal characters
such as the nonporose parietes and porose basis our present species
widely differs from B crenatus

     I am much indebted to M Bosquet for specimens bearing this
    title from Klein Spauwen which certainly appear to me as far as
    can be judged by the separated compartments without the opercular
    valves to belong to our present species

margins oblique sutural edges very finely crenated basis solid

This species the most ancient one as yet well known in the genus
presents to the systematist a most unfortunate peculiarity in the
parietes being almost as often as not permeated by small pores I have
seen no other instance except to a limited degree in B glandula of
this character being variable and hence it must be still considered
of high classificatory value in so varying genus as Balanus Owing
to this varying condition of the parietes together with the basis
being quite solid our present species has as good a claim to be
ranked in the last as in the present section indeed I think it has
more affinity to B crenatus and glandula in the last section
than to any other recent forms I have placed it in its present place
owing to its intimate affinity to B varians in which the parietes
seem always to be solid and partly I believe because all the first
specimens examined by me exhibited no traces of parietal pores
Owing to the kindness of Mr F Edwards I have seen the original
specimens excellently figured by Mr J de C Sowerby in the Mineral
Conchology I can perceive no difference between B unguiformis and
erisma excepting that the walls in the latter are longitudinally
foldeda character we know to be variable in so many species In both
varieties the parietes are sometimes porose and sometimes solid The
smaller specimens however figured in the Mineral Conchology to the
right hand may possibly be a distinct species as I infer from the
narrowness of their radii


  General AppearanceShell tubuloconical sometimes considerably
  elongated and subcylindrical surface either very smooth or
  slightly folded or deeply folded so as to be strongly ribbed
  longitudinally orifice rather large rhomboidal narrow at the
  carinal end toothed but not deeply walls rather thin and fragile
  radii of moderate width with their summits oblique not quite
  smooth Basal diameter of largest specimen about three quarters of
  an inch

  Scuta with the external surface smooth there is a trace of a
  furrow running down the valve from the apex near to the occludent
  margin and this is only worth mentioning from the analogous furrows
  in B bisulcatus Internally the upper surface of the valve is
  roughened the articular ridge is very prominent and slightly
  reflexed there is no distinct adductor ridge there is a slight but
  variable depression for the lateral depressor Tergum with the
  longitudinal furrow shallow spur moderately long about one fourth
  or one fifth of the width of the valve placed at about its own width
  from the basiscutal angle basal end bluntly pointed the basal
  margin on the opposite sides of the spur forms a nearly straight
  line the carinal margin has an extremely narrow border formed by
  upturned lines of growth Internally the surface is roughened with
  little points the articular ridge is prominent the crests for the
  tergal depressores moderately prominent

  Parietes the longitudinal ribs on the internal surface are either
  feebly or in the lower part strongly developed their basal ends
  are only just perceptibly denticulated As already stated in about
  half the specimens there were no traces of parietal pores in the
  other half there were either distinct or obscure pores the pores
  are circular generally of unequal sizes and never large in the
  same individual they would sometimes be almost wholly absent in some
  of the compartments and quite plain in the other compartments The
  Radii are either moderately wide or rather narrow and have their
  upper margins very oblique and not distinctly arched and not quite
  smooth their sutural edges are very finely crenated the teeth or
  septa not being denticulated The upper margins of the al are
  rather less oblique than those of the radii their sutural edges are
  barely crenated The basis is thin and without any trace of pores
  the upper surface is sometimes furrowed in radiating lines

oblique sutural edges almost smooth or finely crenated basis finely
porose Tergum with the spur small narrow bluntly pointed

  HabPort St Julians Patagonia ancient Tertiary formation

This species comes so close to B unguiformis that I have some
doubt whether they ought to be specifically separated the whole shell
is stronger and the basis can be seen to be porose when a polished
section is made the spur of the tergum is smaller more pointed and
more medial but these latter differences may be due to mere variation
Should B varians and unguiformis prove to be the same species the
latter name has the priority


  General AppearanceShell moderately strong and thick shape
  conical or tubular or even inverted conical orifice moderately
  toothed large subtrigonal walls either smooth or longitudinally
  folded the elongated specimens are most apt to be smooth The
  Radii are narrow and oblique Diameter of largest specimen above
  threequarters of an inch

  Scuta with the lines of growth moderately prominent the internal
  surface of the valve has been ill preserved but a very prominent
  hardly reflexed articular ridge can be distinguished as well
  as the absence of an adductor ridge Terga with no distinct
  longitudinal furrow running down the valve spur short bluntly
  pointed narrow about one fifth or one sixth of width of valve
  placed at above its own with from the basiscutal angle the
  basal margin on each side close to the spur curves towards it
  Internally all that can be distinguished is that the articular
  ridge is prominent

  Parietes their inner surfaces appear to have been nearly smooth
  the absence of parietal pores could be made out only by polishing
  a transverse section The Radii are narrow and have their upper
  margins very oblique and rather smooth in the elongated varieties
  the sutural edge appears to be almost absolutely smooth in the
  conical specimens it is slightly crenated the septa being apparently
  not denticulated In living species we have a similar variation in
  the state of the sutural edges of the radii in B balanoides and
  crenatus the edges being much smoother in much elongated specimens
  than in other varieties The al have their upper margins less
  oblique than those of the radii with their sutural edges barely
  crenated The basis is either flat or in the elongated specimens
  deeply cupformed in section it can be seen to be finely and
  irregularly porose

My materials consist of a beautiful series of specimens in Messrs
Wood and Bowerbanks collections but unfortunately only a single
young specimen had its opercular valves preserved Not one specimen
of the very curious variety a had opercular valves yet I
cannot feel any doubt about its being only a variety caused by its
attachment to a thin cylindrical branch of a coral instead of to a
foliaceous Bryozoon it will however be convenient to give a separate
description of this very remarkable form With respect to var b
both sets of specimens came to me with the name B stellaris of
Bronn but as Bronn distinctly states that in his species the parietes
are porose and as such is not here the case this cannot possibly be
that species these specimens did not possess their opercular valves
and therefore cannot be identified with certainty


  General AppearanceShell conical with the orifice rather large
  and rhomboidal The surface is very smooth except in var b
  from the Continent in which it is rugged and longitudinally folded
  The colour is ochreousbrown chiefly no doubt derived from the
  imbedding substance tinged with red The radii often have a much
  darker and more distinct red tint they are sometimes longitudinally
  striped with dirty white The radii are broad with their summits
  straight and very slightly oblique in var b however they slope
  at an angle of about  Basal diameter of largest specimens  of
  an inch but this is an unusual size

  Scuta from a young individual with the growth ridges little
  prominent Internally the articular ridge is moderately prominent
  with its lower end very obliquely rounded off there is no adductor
  ridge there is a minute pit for the lateral depressor muscle
  Terga with a slight longitudinal depression extending down to the
  spur spur short with its lower end almost square or truncated
  about one fourth of width of valve and placed at about half its own
  width from the basiscutal angle Internally the articular ridge is
  prominent the crests for the tergal depressores are feebly developed

  Parietes moderately thick and generally strongly ribbed
  internally without parietal pores Radii wide with their upper
  margins straight not smooth or rounded and very slightly or in
  var b moderately oblique their sutural edges have welldeveloped
  septa which are denticulated the interspaces between the septa
  are filled up solidly The al have their upper margins oblique
  they are only slightly and sometimes not at all added to above the
  level of the opercular membrane their sutural edges are smooth The
  basis is thin but plainly porose

  Var aWith respect to this remarkable variety any one
  would at first think it specifically distinct The shell is much
  compressed or elongated in the rostrocarinal axis sometimes to
  a great degree I have seen a specimen  of an inch in this axis
  and only  in its broadest part but this is a very unusual degree
  of elongation The most remarkable character is the extraordinary
  narrowness of the carina the carinolateral compartments and of the
  rostrum compared with the great breadth especially along the basal
  margin Pl  fig  b  c of the lateral compartments
  The radii are of unusual breadth The tips of the rostrum and of the
  lateral compartments are a little arched in tending to make the
  shell somewhat globular The true basis is extremely narrow fig
   c it is deeply grooved from clasping the thin cylindrical
  stem of the coral to which it had adhered and I have seen specimens
  in which the opposite edges of the groove had met a tube having
  been thus actually formed From the grooved basis and from the
  elongation of the shell in the rostrocarinal axis this species
  presents so close a general resemblance to Balanus calceolus and
  its allies that I have seen it in a collection arranged on the same
  tablet with a fossil specimen of B calceolus Notwithstanding
  the above several stronglymarked characters by which this variety
  differs from the ordinary form there is a resemblance in colour and
  aspect which though difficult to be described made me from the
  first suspect that the two were specifically identical In no point
  of real structure is there any difference excepting that perhaps
  the pores in the basis are here rather smaller but this might arise
  from the little development of the peculiar basis Having come to
  this conclusion I was interested by finding a specimen in Mr Woods
  collection which had originally fixed itself judging from the form
  of the basis on a cylindrical stem but which had subsequently grown
  on to an adjoining flat surface consequently one side of the shell
  presented all the peculiar characters of the present variety whereas
  the other side at the rostral end was undistinguishable from the
  ordinary form The unequal development of the rostrum on the two
  sides was very striking and clearly showed how great an effect could
  be produced by the nature of the surface of attachment

  This singular variety cannot be considered accidental in the sense
  in which this term may be applied to some varieties the larva
  evidently fixes itself intentionally in a certain definite position
  on the branch of the coral when a branch is chosen exactly as in
  the case of Balanus calceolus or Scalpellum vulgare But when
  other species of Balani occasionally fix themselves on branched
  corals their position seems to be accidental and unsymmetrical thus
  among the symmetrically elongated specimens of the present species I
  found one specimen of Balanus bisulcatus which had evidently been
  attached in an almost transverse position to a branch and had thus
  become much distorted so again I have seen specimens of the recent
  B amaryllis attached irregularly to a Gorgonia in the midst of
  the symmetrically elongated shells of Balanus navicula an ally of
  B calceolus

  This variety does not seem to attain so large a size as the ordinary
  form

  AffinitiesThis species is allied to the two last described
  fossils namely B varians and unguiformis but is perhaps
  more nearly related to the recent B allium an inhabitant of
  the Barrier Reef of Australia The longitudinally folded variety
  b can hardly be distinguished by external aspect or even
  by the opercular valves from B crenatus but when the shell
  is disarticulated the porose walls and nonporose basis of B
  crenatus allow of no mistake in the diagnosis of the two species




 SubGenusACASTA Pl 

  ACASTA Leach Journal de Physique tom lxxxv 

Compartments six parietes and basis nonporose basis calcareous
cupformed not elongated attached to sponges or rarely to the bark
of Isis

  Distribution mundane imbedded in sponges and the spongelike bark of
  Isis


This subgenus in one sense is a very natural one inasmuch as all
the species are closely allied in essential structure in general
appearance and in habit On the other hand in the structure of the
shell in all the characters derived from the opercular valves and
animals body Acasta cannot properly be distinguished generically from
some species of Balanus thus B navicula and cymbiformis agree
in the parietes and basis not being porose and in all other essential
respects differing only in the shell being more elongated in the
rostrocarinal axis and in being attached to Gorgoni instead of to
sponges yet we shall see that Acasta purpurata lives imbedded in
the bark of Isis so that even the habit of being imbedded in sponges
fails Balanus terebratus would have been ranked as an Acasta had it
inhabited sponges On the other hand some species of Balanus inhabit
sponges as is often the case with B spongicola and always with
B declivis but both these species are distinguished easily from
Acasta the former by its porose walls and basis and the latter by
its membranous basis it may however be reasonably doubted whether
such differences ought to be considered as even subgeneric The most
important character of Acasta probably consists in the anterior ramus
of the fourth pair of cirri differing slightly in the arrangement
of its spines and in some other points from the rami of the two
posterior pairs of cirria character not as yet observed in any
other cirripede Had not the genus Acasta been already founded and
extensively admitted certainly I should not have formed it but
considering the close similarity in habits aspect and structure of
the nine species of Acasta and considering the already large size of
the genus Balanus I hope I may stand excused for admitting Acasta as a
subgenus

General AppearanceThe shape varies from nearly globular to that
of a somewhat flattened acorn the orifice being often a little
contracted from the inward curvature of the tips of the parietes
In A spongites however the orifice is generally widely open
and on the other hand in A sporillus the orifice is reduced
to a mere pore The usual tint is pale reddish but A purpurata
is purple and A sporillus purplishbrown The surface is either
smooth or is shagreened with minute points as in A sporillus
and fenestrata and in some specimens of A sulcata and in all
the species except A sporillus and fenestrata many individuals
are furnished with elongated curved sharp shelly points like
those in var spinosus of Balanus tintinnabulum The summits of
the radii which are generally of moderate breadth are more or less
oblique their surface is often marked by lines parallel to the basis
instead of by vertical lines corresponding with the lines of growth
as in most species of Balanus The carinolateral compartments vary in
proportional breadth in the different species in A sporillus they
tend to become rudimentary and in this species Pl  fig  b
their basal margins or rather points do not reach down to the basis
The species are all small A glans and undulata are the largest
being sometimes  of an inch in basal diameter

Opercular ValvesThese differ in no generic respect from those
of Balanus The Scuta are striated longitudinally in several of
the species the adductor ridge is barely developed in any being
most prominent in A cyathus The articular ridge is prominent in
A fenestrata and purpurata In the Terga the spur is either
truncated and very broad or moderately narrow and bluntly pointed
the surface of the valve is often depressed and in A spongites
and fenestrata it is furrowed in the line of the spur The articular
ridge and furrow are well developed in A fenestrata and purpurata
The crests for the tergal depressor muscles are either absent or very
feebly developed

Structure of the Parietes and RadiiThe parietes are not porose
internally they are either smooth or slightly or strongly ribbed in
longitudinal lines the presence of these ribs which are homologous
with the parietal septa in Balanus is variable even in the same
species In A sporillus the inner surface is curiously reticulated
The sutural edges of the radii are either smooth or very slightly
crenated by the septa in lines parallel to the basis The upper
margins of both radii and al are always more or less oblique The
radii sometimes do not extend down to the basis and in this case as
will presently be described apertures are left in the lower half
between the compartments In A glans and lvigata the internal
margin of the wall of each compartment from the sheath to the basis
projects inwards forming inside the shell as many double ridges Pl
 fig  b as there are compartments namely six a nearly
analogous structure occurs in certain species of Balanus The basal
edge of the sheath in most of the species  b  b depends
freely and is hollow beneath but this is always a variable point

BasisThe base is either saucer or cupshaped but in A cyathus
it is almost flat it is generally symmetrical and smooth with the
lines of growth closely approximate In A fenestrata the basis is
commonly as deep as the shell is high The edge in several of the
species is crenated with minute teeth or notches and these are so
large in some specimens of A sulcata and cyathus as to make the
edge almost pectinated In A glans and in a lesser degree in A
lvigata there are six knoblike teeth fig  a corresponding
with the points of junction between the basal edges of the inwardly
prominent margins of the six compartments and the basis in those
specimens in which the six teeth are largely developed six ridges
produced by their successive development extend down towards the
centre of the basal cup When the basal cup is dissolved in acid
there is but a little animalised tissue and an external membrane
formed as usual in slips and furnished with blunt little external
points apparently representing spines each of which has a short
tubulus extending to the corium Although I dissolved the basis of
three specimens I could not distinctly make out any cement nor did I
see any cementducts yet these are readily distinguished after the
dissolution of the basis in acid in Balanus Elminius and Tetraclita
There can be no doubt that the young shell must at first be cemented
to a fibre of the sponge but I suspect that the cementingtissue is
not subsequently formed owing to the support afforded by the growth
of the enveloping sponge As some species of Balanus are habitually or
occasionally imbedded in sponges it is important to observe that the
species of Acasta are not only imbedded but are attached to the fibres
of the sponge but even this character as we have already seen is
not sufficient to distinguish the genus Acasta from Balanus for B
declivis is attached exclusively to sponge

Perforations in the ShellCalcification seems often to fail to a
certain extent in this genus the basal cup in most specimens of A
spongites and in some of A glans and other species is irregularly
perforated by numerous minute orifices closed only by the external
membrane and filled up inside by pulpy corium In some specimens of
A spongites from the Cape of Good Hope parts of the basis were
riddled like a sieve I have seen similar perforations in the parietes
of a few specimens of A glans In some specimens of A sulcata
the radii do not extend quite down to the basal edge of the walls
Pl  fig  a and in consequence a small cleft closed only
by membrane is left between the compartments for a little space
above the basal cup In A fenestrata fig  a and in a lesser
degree in A purpurata  a not only do the radii not extend
to the basal cup but the parietes either on one or both sides of
each suture are hollowed out so that six large or small elongated
membranecovered openings are formed which extend from beneath the
sheath down to the basal cup These openings which I have not seen
in any other genus will be more fully described under the respective
species

MouthThe parts of the mouth are identical in the several species
and present no generic differences from those in Balanus The outer
maxill and palpi appear unusually prominent the labrum is deeply
notched with no teeth or very obscure teeth on each side The
mandibles have five teeth but the fifth is sometimes confluent with
the inferior angle The maxill are not notched and carry one or two
spines near their inferior angle nearly as large as the upper pair
The outer maxill are bilobed

Cirri in the first pair the rami are very unequal in length the
one ramus being from half to onethird of the length of the other
The segments in the second and third pairs are not so much broader
or so much more crowded with bristles in comparison with the three
posterior pairs as is the case with most species of Balanus The
three posterior pairs except in A purpurata are much elongated
and the long thin segments bear four and sometimes only three pairs
of spines which are generally doubly and finely serrated or even
feathered The most remarkable fact respecting the cirri is that in
A spongites sulcata cyathus and glans the fourth pair
instead of being identical in structure as in all other genera with
the fifth and sixth pairs has on its anterior ramus the pairs of
spines more crowded together with the little intermediate spines and
those in the dorsal tufts a little longer than in the sixth cirrus
and between the pairs of spines there occur some straight upwardly
pointed very minute and very thick spines or teeth And what is
still more remarkable as will hereafter be described in detail in
certain specimens but not in all of A sulcata the front surfaces
of the lower segments on the anterior ramus are developed into thick
small downwardly curved hooklike teeth this likewise is the case
with the upper segment of the pedicel Pl  fig a most
elegant mandiblelike organ for the prehension of prey being thus
formed The variability of such beautifully contrived teeth is very
surprising Some similar teeth occur on the segments of the anterior
ramus of the fourth cirrus but not on the pedicel in A cyathus A
few teeth resembling the above but thicker occur on the segments of
the anterior ramus of the same cirrus in A purpurata

Branchi cIn A spongites I found the branchi rather small
with transverse plications The muscles of the sack which run to the
opercular valves seemed rather feeble in most of the species The
penis in several species was remarkably long and in A spongites I
noticed the straight projecting point at its dorsal base as is common
in Balanus

Affinities cAt the commencement of the description of the genus
I gave my reasons for keeping Acasta distinct as a subgenus from
Balanus The species are particularly troublesome to identify not only
from the great variability of the most obvious characters but from
the very close general external appearance of most of the species and
the consequent necessity for cleaning and disarticulating at least one
specimen in every group The shape however of the shell and basis
and the state of their disarticulated edges whether smooth crenated
or toothed here offer more serviceable though still very variable
characters for the identification of the species than is usual with
sessile cirripedes and this probably is in part due to the almost
free or unattached condition of the whole shell suspended as it were
in the midst of sponges which they inhabit The opercular valves on
the other hand are less serviceable than usual

Range Habitats cThe species are found all over the world
excepting in the very cold latitudes Acasta lvigata ranges
from the Red Sea to the Philippines A spongites from the south
of England and Wales to the Cape of Good Hope and A cyathus from
Madeira to the West Indies most of the other species seem to have
rather confined ranges The East Indian Archipelago seems to be
the metropolis of the genus for here A lvigata fenestrata
purpurata and sporillus are all found Of these four species
A purpurata lives imbedded not in sponges but in the spongelike
bark of an Isis and I think it probable that A sporillus may
have somewhat analogous habits The same species often lives imbedded
in different kinds of sponge thus I have seen A lvigata and
cyathus in apparently three kinds and A spongites in as I
believe four kinds The genus existed during the miocene period in
the Coralline Crag under a form closely allied to A spongites

     I am greatly indebted to Mr Bowerbank for his great
    kindness in looking over his immense collection of sponges from
    all parts of the world and sending to me all the specimens of
    Acasta he could find imbedded in them

     As the plate to the Supplement to the Encyclop Brit is
    marked as engraved in  I presume Dr Leach gave a proof to
    Lamarck thus enabling him to publish this species four years
    before the Supplement itself appeared

Carinolateral parietes about one sixth of width of lateral parietes
inner surface of the parietes generally ribbed feebly scutum with the
articular ridge abruptly cut off at its lower end tergum with the spur
roundedtruncated about one third of width of valve

  HabSouth coast of England South Wales Tenby Portugal
  Naples Sicily Cape of Good Hope


This species and the three following have caused me much doubt and
trouble At first I took the view here adopted namely that they
were distinct more careful examination made me run them altogether
under one name Finally after still further deliberation and the
examination of a few additional specimens I concluded there was the
least chance of error in classing them separately I may here mention
that in some sponge from the Cape of Good Hope this species was
mingled with Balanus spongicola


  General AppearanceThe shape is usually that of a cup the
  orifice being in most cases rather large and deeply notched owing
  to the great obliquity of the radii and al The surface is generally
  smooth but furnished with sharp calcareous projections The colour
  is pinkish and chiefly in the upper part of the shell the lower
  part is often yellowish from the preserved epidermis The parietes
  in the carinolateral compartments are always narrow being only one
  sixth or one seventh of the width of the parietes in the lateral
  compartments The radii are not very wide never equalling in width
  the parietes The basis is moderately deep and sometimes very deep
  being even occasionally curled like a horn on one side The specimens
  from Lisbon and Naples are a little larger than any British specimen
  which I have seen the former being  of an inch in basal diameter

  Scuta these are striated longitudinally in close lines generally
  plainly but to a variable degree The whole valve is flat thin
  and rather elongated with barely a trace of an adductor ridge
  the articular ridge is short and rather prominent it terminates
  downwards abruptly and this does not appear to be the case in the
  two following species Terga these are small compared with the
  scuta they are slightly beaked the spur is truncated but rounded
  more especially on the carinal side it is rather more than one third
  of the width of the whole valve The articular ridge and crests for
  the depressor muscles are feebly developed

  Structure of the Parietes and RadiiThe state of the inner
  surface of the parietes varies much generally they are slightly
  ribbed close to the basis the ribs sometimes extending up to the
  sheath rarely the surface is quite smooth The edges of the radii
  are slightly crenated The upper internal surfaces of the radii
  where overlying the al are usually marked by feeble undulating
  lines nearly parallel to the basis The al have very oblique
  summits

  Basis this is generally of a regular cuplike form and about two
  thirds as deep as the shell is high sometimes it is pointed at the
  bottom and distorted The edge is feebly crenated and rarely quite
  smooth It is often penetrated by small rounded irregular holes and
  I have seen specimens from the Cape of Good Hope with parts like a
  sieve

  Cirri in the first pair the anterior ramus is nearly thrice as
  long as the posterior ramus The second cirrus is short with one
  ramus longer by three or four segments than the other ramus the
  terminal segments are truncated The third cirrus is about one third
  longer than the second cirrus In the anterior ramus of the fourth
  pair the regular pairs of spines are rather crowded together in the
  upper part of each segment and the intermediate little spines and
  dorsal tufts are rather long in comparison with those of the fifth
  and sixth pairs of cirri moreover amongst the regular pairs a few
  very minute and thick spines pointing upwards could be perceived
  So that we here have the very unusual case of the fourth cirrus not
  exactly resembling the fifth and sixth pairs and we shall see in
  the following species that this same anterior ramus of the fourth
  cirrus presents in addition another very extraordinary character In
  the sixth cirrus there are on each segment four pairs of spines

I am almost ashamed to admit this species so small are its differences
compared with A spongites yet I think that it probably is a
distinct form


  In general appearance and character this species comes very near to
  A spongites As in the latter the parietes of the carinolateral
  compartments are narrow The orifice seems always to be smaller
  Internally the parietes are generally much more strongly ribbed
  and the edges of the basal cup more plainly crenated The sheath is
  generally coloured of a brighter pink sometimes tinged with orange
  The average largest specimens from  to  of an inch in basal
  diameter are a little larger than the largest European specimens
  I have seen one specimen from Moreton Bay  in basal diameter and
  from the basal cup being very deep actually  in height The
  scutum has the articular ridge not so prominent and not so abruptly
  cut off at the lower end as in A spongites on the other hand
  the adductor ridge seems rather more prominent but these differences
  are trifling In the tergum the breadth of the spur fig  c 
  d varies in specimens taken out of the same branch of sponge some
  can hardly be distinguished from the same valves in A spongites
  but generally the spur is broader and squarer

     In Mr Cumings collection there is a specimen from Sydney
    which I fully believe to be the present species but cannot be
    positively sure as the opercular valves have been lost which is
    very remarkable from the walls of the carinolateral compartments
    being reduced to the thickness of a mere thread not one twentieth
    of the width of the lateral compartments we here see the structure
    of Acasta sporillus prefigured

  This species presents some remarkable varieties in one specimen
  from Sydney the parietes were externally ribbed longitudinally
  fig  b the ribs being roughened with minute points giving to
  the shell an elegant appearance and this without doubt is the A
  sulcata of Lamarck procured by Peron at Sharks Bay lat  S
  on the opposite of the Australian continent some specimens from Port
  Lincoln in South Australia were not ribbed only smoothly striated
  in longitudinal lines although both sets of specimens had almost
  smooth scuta and were thus different from common specimens yet
  there could be no doubt from their similarity in all other points
  that they did not differ specifically from them though the latter
  had their scuta striated but not their parietes Hence we see that
  there is no relation between the stri on the parietes and on the
  scuta The Port Lincoln specimens and some others were remarkable
  from the radii not extending down to the basal cup a minute cleft
  covered only by membrane being thus left along the sutures low
  down between the parietes fig  a we shall see this singular
  structure strongly developed in A perforata Owing apparently to
  these clefts the edge of the basal cup exhibited traces of six
  knoblike teeth like those characteristic of A glans

  CirriThe cirri resemble those of A spongites with the
  exception that the segments on the posterior pairs bear only
  three main pairs of spines With respect to the anterior ramus of
  the fourth pair of cirri the following very singular facts were
  observedin a specimen from New South Wales var with the tergum
  having a narrow spur on two or three of the lower but not on the
  lowest segments the front margin was produced or developed into two
  or three minute thick teeth slightly curved like hooks downwards
  in other specimens from New South Wales var with the tergum
  having a broad spur and inhabiting the same branch of sponge with
  the lastmentioned variety there was no trace of these teeth But
  again in two other specimens with the tergum having a broad spur
  collected by different persons near Sydney and in another from
  South Australia this structure was carried to an extreme for in
  these as represented Pl  fig  there were beautifully formed
  teeth on the fourteen lower segments the twelve upper being without
  them and likewise on the upper segment of the pedicel These teeth
  are graduated in size on each segment they are admirably adapted for
  securing any prey and in fact they convert each segment into a
  mandiblelike organ On the segments on which these teeth are well
  developed some of the regular pairs of spines are aborted

  DiagnosisFinally this species if it be as I believe
  distinct differs from A spongites only in the internal surface of
  the parietes being more strongly ribbed and brighter colouredin
  the edge of the basal cup being more plainly crenatedin the
  articular ridge of the scutum being of a different shapein the
  spur of the tergum being often broaderin the segments of the
  posterior cirri having only three pairs of main spinesand lastly
  in the occasional presence of the hooklike teeth on the anterior
  ramus of the fourth cirrus

  HabMadeira Mus Lowe and Bowerbank West Indies Mus

I feel more confidence in this case than in that of A sulcata that
we here have a distinct species though at one time I treated it only
as a marked variety of A spongites I rely chiefly on the great
proportional width of the radii of all the compartments and on the
width of the carinolateral compartments compared with the lateral
compartments and on the general shape of the shell which differs
considerably from that of the two previous forms in consequence of
Acasta being attached to and imbedded in a yielding substance such
as sponge I believe external form to be of more value as a specific
character in this genus than in most sessile cirripedes I have
examined specimens taken out of the yielding Spongia officinalis and
out of an unusually compact sponge and they resembled each other in
every respect


  General AppearanceColour pale pink or that of flesh basis
  remarkably flat and rather small with the walls above bulging out
  a little The radii are very wide being wider than the parietes
  to which they belong the orifice is generally rather large The
  parietes of the carinolateral compartments vary from one third to
  one fourth of the width of the parietes of the lateral compartments
  Basal diameter of largest specimen  of an inch Internally the
  parietes are generally more strongly ribbed than in A spongites

  The Opercular Valves are large owing to the form of the shell The
  Scuta present no particular character and are not distinguishable
  from those of A sulcata but the adductor ridge is perhaps rather
  more developed The Terga Pl  fig  c are nearly as large
  as the scuta and this is an unusual circumstance the spur is more
  than half as wide as the valve it is placed not quite close to the
  basiscutal angle on the carinal side the basal margin of the valve
  slopes a little towards the spur I may mention that in several
  specimens from Madeira the scuta and terga on one side had grown
  to a monstrous thickness

  Cirri these resemble in every respect those of A spongites
  with the remarkable exception that on the anterior ramus of the
  fourth cirrus several segments were furnished with the beautiful
  downward curved mandiblelike teeth as in A sulcata but
  differently from in that species there were none on the upper
  segment of the pedicel I should have thought this an excellent
  specific character had not these teeth been so extremely variable in
  A sulcata

  Finally I think this species is more nearly related to A sulcata
  than to A spongites




 ACASTA UNDULATA Pl  fig 

Shell apparently as in A spongites but larger scutum marked by
longitudinal ridges often in pairs with the intermediate furrows
rather wide spur of tergum nearly half as wide as valve

  Fossil in Coralline Crag Sutton Mus S Wood


I owe to Mr Wood the inspection of a fine suite of separate valves
Owing to the shell never having been found entire its general shape is
not known and what is of more consequence the relative proportional
width of the parietes of the carinolateral compartment is unknown I
have but with doubt given it a distinct specific name owing to the
peculiar character of the furrows on the scuta and to the large size
of the whole shell In its other characters it comes nearest to A
spongites excepting in the spur of the tergum which resembles that
of A sulcata


  The compartments appear to have been rather smooth externally The
  radii are not wide as in A cyathus and the basis is cupformed
  Internally the parietes are feebly ribbed as in A spongites
  Judging from the dimensions of the separated valves this species
  must have equalled and perhaps exceeded the size of the largest
  living species namely A glans from Australia Hence we may
  infer that the basal diameter probably exceeded  of an inch I
  may add that the largest European specimens of A spongites from
  Naples and Portugal are only  of an inch in basal diameter

  ScutaThese seem to resemble the scuta of A spongites in all
  respects except in the longitudinal ridges standing much further
  apart and consequently in the furrows being much wider each ridge
  is generally double Although there is a good deal of variability
  in the character of these ridges in A undulata and likewise in
  A spongites I have not seen any form intermediate between them
  It must however be confessed that this is an extremely variable
  character in many sessile cirripedes In the Terga the spur is
  about half the width of the whole valve and therefore rather wider
  than in A spongites

  c


This fine species seems to be extremely common imbedded in an open
porose sponge on the eastern and southern shores of Australia It
is very distinct from the other species with the exception of the
following A lvigata which with some hesitation I have allowed to
remain specifically separated


  General AppearanceExcepting in its larger size this species
  differs in external appearance but little from A spongites its
  colour is pale dirty reddish The surface is generally studded
  with small calcareous points The parietes of the carinolateral
  compartments are about one fourth of the width of the parietes of the
  lateral compartments and therefore proportionally of the same width
  as in A cyathus The largest specimen which I have seen was 
  of an inch in basal diameter

  ScutaThese are slightly narrower thicker and more convex than
  in A spongites they are strongly striated in longitudinal lines
  The articular ridge is very feebly developed Terga in fullgrown
  specimens the spur is half the width of the whole valve and is
  truncated its basal edge being parallel to the basal margin of the
  valve The articular ridge and crests for the depressor muscles are
  very feebly developed

  Internal structure of the parietesThe inner surface of the
  parietes is quite smooth without even a trace of ribs or teeth But
  the most important character is that the internal lateral margins on
  both sides of each compartment from the sheath to the basis project
  inwards and form a rim so that when the shell is viewed from within
  Pl  fig  b representing the lateral and carinolateral
  compartments and part of the carina the six sutures are seen to be
  strengthened by six double columns

  BasisThis is moderately cupformed The edge in order to
  meet the basal points of the inwardly projecting lateral margins
  of the six compartments has six knoblike teeth These are placed
  at unequal distances for two on each side stand near each other
  owing to the narrowness of the carinolateral compartments The
  degree of their development varies extremely when most developed
  as in the specimen figured Pl  fig  a each tooth is bifid
  and a little hollowed out so as to receive the points of the two
  inwardly projecting margins which form each suture Ridges more or
  less prominent running from each of the six marginal teeth extend
  towards the centre of the cup These six teeth cannot be seen from
  the outside The edge of the cup is rarely crenated but I have seen
  two instances in which this was the case

  CirriIn the first pair the rami are not quite so unequal as
  in A spongites the longer ramus being about twice as long as
  the shorter In the third pair there are some very minute thick
  upwardlypointing spines which I did not notice in A spongites
  In the fourth pair the spines are a little more crowded with longer
  dorsal tufts than in the sixth pair and they are mingled with some
  very minute thick upwardly pointing spines In young individuals
  there are only three pairs of main spines on the segments of the
  sixth pair instead of four pairs

  Var a epidermis coloured dull orangeRed Sea

  HabRed Sea Philippine Archipelago Mus Brit Cuming c


This species of which I have examined many specimens from the above
two and other unknown localities agrees in all essential points of
structure with A glans and consequently I for some time classed
them together but the characters though usually of small value by
which this form differs from A glans being apparently constant I
have with some doubt allowed it to remain specifically distinct These
characters are firstly the much smaller size of the whole shell
in A lvigata secondly the edge of its basal cup being always
crenated which seems to be a rare accident in A glans thirdly
though of secondary importance the scutum being here less plainly
striated and lastly the spur of the tergum being of less breadth
and of a more rounded outline on the other hand it must be confessed
that when small specimens of A glans are taken there is hardly any
difference in the spurs of the terga


  General Appearance and Structure of ShellThe surface of the
  shell is often very smooth but is sometimes studded with some small
  sharp calcareous points The colour is white or pale reddishbrown
  but in the specimens from the Red Sea the tint is more orange
  with the upper part of the shell white The orifice of the shell is
  unusually small The largest specimen which I have seen was only 
  of an inch in basal diameter and therefore less than half the size
  of A glans The internal surfaces of the parietes are smooth
  with the two lateral margins inflected as in A glans The edge of
  the basal cup has six knoblike teeth like those in A glans but
  smaller and in addition it is finely crenated

  Scuta these differ only in being less plainly striated in
  longitudinal lines indeed some specimens show hardly a trace of
  this structure Terga these valves in some varieties Pl  fig
   b can hardly be distinguished from those of equal size from
  young individuals of A glans other varieties have the spur Pl
   fig  a not truncated but broadly pointed and therefore of
  considerably different shape

  Neither in the mouth nor cirri could I detect any difference with
  A glans




 ACASTA FENESTRATA Pl  fig  a c

Shell reddish with six large membranecovered apertures between the
sutures above the basal cup carinolateral parietes half as broad as
lateral parietes internally parietes and edge of basis smooth tergum
with the articular ridge short and prominent spur pointed

  HabPhilippine Archipelago Mus Cuming


  General AppearanceShell rather elongated or tubular with the
  upper part reddish and the surface roughened with very minute
  points The basal cup is generally as deep as the shell is high
  ending downwards in a blunt point often curved to one side The
  summits of the radii as usual are oblique The parietes of the
  carinolateral compartments are about half as wide as the parietes of
  the lateral compartments and are therefore of greater proportional
  width than in the foregoing or any other species of the genus
  The large membranecovered openings or as they may be called
  windows presently to be described between the lower halves of the
  compartments is much the most remarkable character of this species
  The largest specimen which I have seen was only  in diameter and
   of an inch in height measured from the basal point of the cup to
  the tips of the compartments

  ScutaThese barely exhibit a trace of longitudinal stri The
  valve is rather thick and convex The basitergal angle is much
  rounded off Internally the articular ridge is thick and rather
  prominent Terga the valve is furrowed in the line of the spur
  the spur is pointed and rather long it is distinctly separated from
  the basiscutal angle of the valve and the basal margin on the two
  sides of the spur forms a straight line The articular ridge is
  prominent and short

  Structure of the Parietes Radii and BasisThe parietes are
  internally quite smooth down to its basis The edges of the radii are
  also smooth as is the edge of the basal cup The al project less
  than usual The radii are of moderate breadth they extend downwards
  only a little below the sheath namely about half way down the
  shell where they terminate as usual in a point The increase in
  width during growth of the radii and their not extending down to
  the basis would necessarily cause a gap between the opposed edges
  of the walls in the portion beneath the radii but besides this
  the edges of the walls themselves beneath the radii and on the
  opposed side beneath the al are hollowed out but on the latter
  side or beneath the al sometimes in a lesser degree The result of
  this is that the compartments in their lower halves are separated
  from each other by membranecovered windows or apertures arched at
  their upper ends and of considerable size namely about as wide as
  the parietes of the carinolateral compartments I have only further
  to remark that during the downward growth of the parietes the
  apertures increase in size but at the same time become closed up at
  their upper ends and the arched layers of shell added at these upper
  ends assume a very different aspect from the rest of the parietal
  surfaceappearing like two wedges with their points upwards let
  in on one side of the suture between the ordinary parietal surface
  and the radius and on the other side of the suture between the
  ordinary parietal surface and the recipient furrow of the radius

  The animals body was in a bad state of preservation but as far
  as I could make out the cirri resembled those of A glans

  AffinitiesThis species differs from A glans in not having the
  internal margins of the compartments projecting inwards It differs
  from all the ordinary varieties of A spongites in the smoothness
  of the basal edges of the parietes and of the edge of the cup in
  the greater width of the carinolateral compartment though this is
  a variable point in A spongites slightly in the shape of the
  scuta and terga and lastly in the large membranecovered openings
  between the compartments




 ACASTA PURPURATA Pl  fig  a c

Shell dull blueishpurple with six small membranecovered apertures
between the sutures close above the basis tergum with the articular
ridge very short and prominent spur very broad and rounded

  HabSumatra Philippine Archipelago imbedded in the bark of an
  Isis Mus Cuming Stutchbury Brit


This species is perfectly distinct from the others as shown by its
general appearance its habits and the structure of its opercular
valves it is allied to A fenestrata in having membranecovered
apertures between the compartments and in some respects in its
opercular valves it is also allied to A sulcata and cyathus in
the parietes being often internally ribbed in the basal cup having a
crenated edge and in the anterior ramus of the fourth cirrus being
furnished with the minute hooklike spines


  General AppearanceSubglobular slightly compressed with a
  rather small orifice smooth but sometimes furnished with sharp
  shelly points dull purple more or less dark with the upper parts
  of the walls often white The radii are rather narrow and generally
  white with their summits only slightly oblique but variable in
  this latter respect The parietes of the carinolateral compartments
  are narrow being only one sixth of the width of the parietes of the
  lateral compartments In some specimens there are membranecovered
  apertures of considerable size in others mere narrow clefts between
  the basal halves of the compartments The basal cup is moderately
  deep The largest specimen was only  of an inch in basal diameter

  Scuta rather broad externally convex not longitudinally
  striated articular ridge prominent short not extending down above
  one third of the length of the valve Depression for the adductor
  muscle deep On the internal surface near to the rostral angle a
  rather large purple spot of corium adhered to the valve Terga
  broad externally rather convex scutal margin protuberant carinal
  margin slightly inflected or furnished internally with a rim
  articular ridge prominent very short not extending down above one
  fourth of the valve Spur very broad rounded confluent with the
  basiscutal angle of the valve

  Internal Structure of the Parietes Radii and BasisThe
  parietes internally are either quite smooth or more commonly
  ribbed with the basal edge in consequence crenated the ribs
  are either placed at an unusual distance from each other and
  consequently are few in number or are pretty close together The
  edge of the basal cup is either quite smooth or closely crenated
  or distantly toothed in conformity with the state of the internal
  surface of the parietes The radii have nearly smooth edges with
  their summits more or less oblique They sometimes extend down only
  three fourths or only two thirds of the length of the shell and
  the margins of the parietes under the radii being a little hollowed
  out the sutures are converted into clefts or apertures of course
  covered by membrane like but not so large as those in A
  fenestrata The margins of the parietes are hollowed out only on the
  side of the radius and not on both sides of the sutures as is most
  usual in A fenestrata In some specimens the radii extended down
  close to the basal cup and only very minute clefts were left between
  the opposed edges of the parietes

  In the animals body the only noticeable character was that on the
  anterior ramus of the fourth pair of cirri some of the segments were
  furnished with very broad and thick small downwardly curved teeth
  or hooks like those described in certain varieties of A sulcata
  but they are here stronger and thicker The segments in the three
  posterior pairs of cirri are not so much elongated as in the other
  species




 ACASTA SPORILLUS Pl  fig  a d

Shell purplishbrown with the parietes internally strongly ribbed
and reticulated carinolateral compartments extremely narrow not
extending down to the basis

  HabSooloo Islands East Indian Archipelago Mus Dana


I am indebted to Mr Dana the distinguished naturalist of the United
States Antarctic Expedition for two specimens of this interesting
species which in the singular reticulated structure of the inner
surface of the walls and in the almost rudimentary condition of the
carinolateral compartments not extending down to the basal cup is
very distinct from the foregoing species I have used Mr Danas very
appropriate MS name of sporillus The specimens were dredged up
lying quite loose and unattached at the bottom of the Sooloo sea the
one which I opened must have long lain dead but Mr Dana assures me
that some were living and he has sent me drawings of parts of the
mouth and cirri I am much surprised at this circumstance for analogy
would have made me believe that this species must have been imbedded
in some spongelike body such as the bark of a zoophyte and that it
could not have lived unattached I may add that a small fragment of a
brown leathery substance adhered to the upper end of one of the two
specimens and this seems to indicate attachment


  General AppearanceShell shaped like a pointed acorn slightly
  flattened orifice extremely small surface very finely punctured
  covered by a purplishbrown epidermis with transverse stripes of
  different shades and with the apex dark according to Mr Dana when
  fresh the colour was purplishcarmine Radii narrow white The
  carinolateral compartments are extremely narrow the wallportion
  fig  b forming a mere linear rib terminating downwards in
  a sharp point which does not reach the basal cup hence this
  compartment evidently tends to become rudimentary The basal cup is
  moderately deep and pointed Basal diameter  height from the
  bottom of the cup to the top of the shell  of an inch

  Scuta narrow with the upper part produced not striated
  longitudinally coloured by a pale purple longitudinal band
  Internally there is scarcely a trace of an articular ridge which
  in the other species is always more or less developed Terga with
  the spur bluntly pointed nearly the whole basal margin on the
  carinal side slopes towards the spur

  Internal Structure of the Parietes Radii and Basal CupThe
  parietes are strongly ribbed internally and these ribs are connected
  by very narrow less prominent transverse slightly branched ridges
  giving a reticulated structure to the inner surface Between several
  of the main longitudinal ribs in the lower part of the shell new
  ribs may be seen in process of formation and these tend to convert
  the reticulated structure into a double row of minute cells I have
  not met with an exactly similar structure in any other cirripede but
  I have no doubt that the little transverse ridges are homologous with
  the transverse calcareous septa in the parietal pores of many Balani
  in the same manner as the internal longitudinal ribs in this and
  other species of Acasta are homologous with the longitudinal septa
  forming the above pores The edge of the basal cup is pectinated with
  teeth which lock into the teeth formed by the ends of the internal
  parietal ribs The radii are narrow and have smooth edges The al
  project beyond the parietes to a remarkably small extent The sheath
  is free or hollow beneath I have already described the almost
  rudimentary condition of the carinolateral compartments this is
  best exhibited in an internal view of the two compartments as given
  in Pl  fig  b

  Animals body unknown to me from Mr Danas drawing the three
  posterior pairs of cirri seem to have been much elongated and the
  rami of the first pair as usual unequal in length

     From a note by the Editor it appears that Schumachers essay
    appeared before the number of the Journal containing Leachs paper
    so that Schumachers name must be adopted

     I have not seen a complete copy of this work and give the
    title from a catalogue the running heading of the part containing
    the Cirripedia is Opuscoli Scientifici

Compartments four sometimes externally calcified together parietes
permeated by pores generally forming several rows Basis flat
irregular calcareous or membranous

  HabThroughout the tropical and warmer temperate seas


General AppearanceThe shell is conical more or less depressed
and very rarely even when growing in crowded groups becomes
cylindrical or elongated The orifice is seldom large generally
diamondshaped or oval The colour is either nearly white or purple
occasionally even inky black or very dark green and sometimes of a
pale pink peachblossom The surface is sometimes smooth but more
commonly longitudinally ribbed the outer lamina of shell is very often
wholly corroded away excepting close to the basis leaving the solidly
upfilled parietal tubes exposed these give the shell a striated
appearance or they appear like flattened tapering points adpressed to
its surface Pl  fig  b Lamarck attempted to express this
appearance by using the specific name of stalactiferus The colour
of the shell depends to a considerable extent on the colour of the
shelly matter in these exposed parietal tubes We shall presently see
that the corrosion and disintegration to which some of the species
are so liable plays an important part during their growth The radii
are either well developed as in most of the species or they are
entirely absent as in the great majority of specimens of T porosa
and serrata In many individuals of T porosa and purpurascens
not only are the radii absent but the four compartments are calcified
together without any trace on the external surface of the sutures
The largest specimen which I have seen of T porosa which is the
largest species was two inches in basal diameter and nearly one inch
and a half in height

ScutaThese valves are subtriangular and either longitudinally or
transversely elongated Externally the growthridges are moderately
prominent and in T costata and crulescens they are crossed by
longitudinal stri Along the occludent margin the inflected extremity
of each alternate growthridge is generally much thickeneda set of
teeth being thus formed by which the two valves are locked together
In T porosa this character is variable for sometimes every
alternate ridge and sometimes only two or three ridges separated
from each other by several growthridges are thus developed into
teeth The articular ridge is either moderately prominent or is
extremely prominent as in T crulescens but the lower edge in no
case depends as a free hingelike style as sometimes in Balanus
The adductor ridge is generally well developed and distinct from
the articular ridge in T purpurascens it is very blunt in T
serrata it is united to the articular ridge half way up it thus
forming a deep tubular cavity running up to the apex of the valve in
T crulescens the adductor ridge is very short and is united to
or almost continuous with the lower end of the articular ridge a
small subcylindrical tubular cavity being thus formed Small crests
exist for the attachment of the rostral and lateral depressor muscles
in most of the species excepting T purpurascens and costata in
which however more especially in the former there are instead
of crests minute pits for the attachment These crests vary much in
prominence in the same species

TergaThese valves present no essential differences from those of
Balanus they are sometimes beaked and the beak is hollow and occupied
by a thread of corium as in that genus The external surface of the
valve is often depressed in the line of the spur but there is never a
longitudinal furrow with the edges folded in as in Balanus The spur
is very short in T purpurascens In T radiata the articular
ridge is remarkably prominent The crests for the depressor muscles are
well developed in all the species The shape of the terga is variable
in nearly all the species and greatly so in T porosa

CompartmentsOwing to there being only four compartments the
lateral pair are large the size of the carina relatively to the
rostrum varies according as its al have been added to during
diametric growth The walls are very thick and are composed of
numerous tubes in some species as many as fourteen or fifteen rows
being exposed on the basal margin Pl  fig  g The tubes
are generally angular and slightly elongated in the ray of the
circular shell sometimes they are nearly circular and small New
tubes are formed only at the basal edge of the outer lamina by the
bifurcation of the septa which form the tubes In very young specimens
there is only a single row of tubes and in T rosea this holds
good throughout life in this species fig  d the tubes in the
single row are large and quadrangular and the outer lamina of shell
is strengthened by numerous small internal longitudinal plates
I believe the branching septa which separate and form the parietal
tubes correspond with the longitudinal septa in the more simple
walls of Balanus The tubes become solidly filled up in their upper
parts with hard and generally coloured shelly matter The degree
to which they are filled up differs in the different species the
external side of each tube is always first thus coated The thin outer
lamina of shell in several of the species commonly disintegrates and
disappears the upfilled parietal tubes being thus exposed The inner
lamina of the walls is generally smooth but in T radiata it is
longitudinally ribbed as in most species of Balanus The sheath is
generally darkcoloured its lower edge does not project or overhang
the inner lamina as is usual in Balanus excepting in T serrata
and in some few varieties of T porosa

The Radii when developed are either narrow or broad with their
summits either oblique or extending in a straight line from the top
of one compartment to that of another In T serrata I have not
seen a single specimen with the radii developed in T porosa they
are very seldom developed and then apparently only in quite young
specimens in which they are narrow in T purpurascens they seem to
be about as often developed as not and when present they are broad
in T costata crulescens and radiata they are always largely
developed In some specimens of the species in which the radii are
not developed even the sutures do not reach the external surface
the outer lamina of the parietes being continuous all round so that
the shell seems formed of a single piece Even in such specimens the
four compartments viewed from within can be seen to be distinct and
the sutures can generally be traced across the whole thickness of the
parietal tubes in this latter case when the sutures are broken open
the radii are seen to be represented Pl   h by a few small
sinuous ridges Owing to the disintegration of the upper and outer part
of the shell and the consequent exposure of parts of the sheath and
al the radii sometimes appear as if developed when such is not the
case With respect to the internal structure of the radii they are
formed in T purpurascens and costata of tubes like those of the
parietes and therefore according to the normal plan whilst in the
other species they are formed by longitudinal sinuous ridges sending
out on each side irregular denticuli and the interspaces between
the ridges are filled up solidly during the growth of the radii in
all the species except in T radiata in which they are left to a
considerable extent open These sinuous ridges with their denticuli
homologically represent the branching septa which form the parietal
tubes The edges of the al are crenated in all the species except in
T costata

Diametric growthWhen first examining groups of T porosa in
none of which the radii had been developed and in which consequently
the shell could not have grown in diameter but only at its basal
margin I was at first unable to comprehend how the upper part of the
shell and the orifice could have acquired their proper proportional
width The young shell at its first formation starts with an orifice
so small that a pin could hardly be inserted in it and this in many
individuals is never increased in diameter by the diametric growth
of the shell but in place of this as the conical shell is added to
at its base the whole upper part disintegrates and wears away the
orifice becoming thus enlarged We thus see that the corrosion and
wearing away of the upper part of the shell is a necessary element in
its growth The development of the radii which in some of the species
as in T purpurascens at first seems to be quite capricious really
depends upon the fact whether the specimens have been exposed to
disintegration for I have almost always found that when the outer
lamina of shell has been well preserved the radii have been developed
and the orifice has been enlarged by their growth instead of by the
wearing down of the upper part of the conical shell

BasisThis consists of a very thin flat though irregular
translucent calcareous plate which towards the edges is sometimes
membranous In T purpurascens the basis is entirely membranous
When a portion of the calcareous base is dissolved in acid a tissue
is left composed of several lamin to which numerous bifurcating
cementducts are attached even before dissolution these delicate
bifurcating ducts can just be perceived by the aid of a simple lens

MouthThe several organs present no particular characters There
are generally three teeth on each side of the notch in the labrum
The palpi usually have parallel sides but are clubshaped in T
purpurascens and costata The mandibles have generally four teeth
but there are five in T vitiata and only three in T costata The
maxill are notched The outer maxill are bilobed in front

CirriThe segments of the three posterior pairs usually support
only three pairs of main spines but there are four pairs in T
vitiata and costata between each pair there is either a tuft of
fine spines or a single fine spine The rami of the first cirrus
are unequal in length In the third cirrus the posterior ramus is
sometimes much elongated but sometimes both rami are short and blunt
Some of the segments in the third cirrus often support very coarsely
and doubly pectinated spines Under the head of T porosa it will be
seen to what a remarkable degree the relative numbers of the segments
in the several cirri vary even in specimens taken out of the same
cluster

The Branchi are well developed at least in T porosa and
costata as a large plicated tapering fold with a small second
fold on the inner side at the base In T porosa the stomach is
destitute of cca The vesicul seminales in this same species are
large with their broad blunt ends reflexed The ovarian tubes
surround the sack and cover the basal plate

Distribution and HabitatsThis genus is confined to the tropics
and to the warmer parts of the temperate seas in the southern
hemisphere it ranges south to the Cape of Good Hope and to Van
Diemens Land in the northern hemisphere it does not appear to range
so far I do not know of any authentic case of a species having been
found in the Mediterranean or on the shores of the United States
north of the West Indies Tetraclita porosa is found round the whole
world T radiata also has a very wide range inhabiting the West
Indies the East Indian Archipelago and New South Wales This latter
species as well as T crulescens is often attached to the bottoms
of ships adhering to Balanus tintinnabulum The several species live
attached to tidal rocks to littoral shells or to massive corals I
have met with two instances in the West Indies and the Philippine
Archipelago of T porosa adhering to wood Tetraclita porosa
seems to feed chiefly on crustaceans the number and the size of the
amphipods isopods and entomostracans together with an annelid
in the stomachs of some specimens from South America was quite
surprising As many as five species occur in the same region in the
eastern half of the world thus on the shores of New South Wales we
have T porosa vitiata radiata purpurascens and rosea in
the Philippine Archipelago we have T porosa vitiata costata
and crulescens

I have not seen any species of this genus fossil

VariationThe species vary in shape nearly but not quite as much
as in Balanus for we very rarely here see cylindrical varieties but
in the same species we have extremely depressed steeply conical and
convex forms the orifice varies in relative size the state of the
surface whether ribbed or smooth whether well preserved or corroded
the upfilled parietal tubes being thus exposed varies more than in
Balanus The colour also varies specimens of T porosa Pl  fig
 a to  f being dark purple or even inky black white pale
pinkishpurple and green as far as I have seen the pinkish varieties
of T porosa are confined to the eastern half of the world Even the
ridges and crests on the under side of the scutum vary in some degree
and the tergum in T porosa varies considerably and in some of the
other species slightly in general shape I believe that the tergum
becomes narrow and elongated when the shell is steeply conical with
the orifice of small diameter After having spent several days in
disarticulating and closely examining the many specimens of T porosa
in my possession I concluded that its varieties formed at least four
species these being in external appearance extremely distinct but
ultimately the many intermediate forms compelled me to unite all into
a single species Again I may instance the conical ribbed variety
of T purpurascens Pl  fig  b with the outer lamina of
the shell preserved and with the radii widely developed as having not
the smallest resemblance to the other common depressed variety fig 
a having a granulated surface produced by the exposed tips of the
upfilled parietal tubes and without a trace of the radii or even of
the sutures I may add that according to the characters used by some
authors these two varieties would be classed in two separate genera

To distinguish the species of this genus the chief reliance must be
placed as in the case of most other sessile cirripedes on the general
outline of the opercular valves and on the ridges and crests on their
under sides the internal structure however of the radii and in
a lesser degree of the parietes must not be overlooked I have not
found the parts of the mouth or the differences in the cirri of much
service and it will be shown under T porosa that the relative
numbers of the segments in the several cirri and even their shape is
extraordinarily variable

AffinitiesAll the species are pretty closely allied and there is
no ground for making any sectional division of the eight species more
especially not on the ground whether or no the radii are developed
Tetraclita purpurascens taking into account all the characters
including the animals body is perhaps the most distinct species in
the genus but it is closely allied to T costata In the wellmarked
character of the parietes being formed of a single row of large tubes
T rosea differs from all the other species The genus is closely
allied to Balanus I can point out no difference in the animals
body nor any constant difference in the opercular valves The ridges
and crests on the under sides of the scuta are more prominent in
Tetraclita and all the species excepting two have crests though
sometimes very slight for the attachment of the rostral depressor
muscle and these occur only in two species of Balanus crests also
for the attachment of the lateral depressor muscle are common in
Tetraclita but rare in Balanus The main character however of the
genus as compared with Balanus is derived from the existence of
only four compartments and in a lesser degree from the several rows
of parietal pores but as just stated T rosea has only a single
row and on the other hand in Balanus crenatus there is a slight
tendency exhibited in the dividing of the longitudinal septa near
the outer lamina to form a second row of parietal pores and in B
cariosus moreover we actually have two or three rows of irregular
and very short pores The thin yet solid calcareous basis which
occurs in all the species of Tetraclita excepting T purpurascens
resembles the basis in Balanus flosculus and imperator but I
suspect that the structure of the cementducts is different in the two
genera

     As Gmelin and Bruguire published the same year I do not
    know which comes first but I have adopted the best known name
    Most authors give amongst their references Chemnitz vol 
    Tab  fig   but the accompanying description is more
    applicable to T serrata of this work than to T porosa
    without a figure or description however of the under side of the
    scutum it is impossible to decide Several authors also give
    Lepas cariosa of Pallas as a synonym this however is the
    Balanus cariosus of this work

absent shell steeply conical with the surface generally corroded and
having a stalactiferous appearance

  General AppearanceThis the widestdistributed and much
  the commonest species of the genus varies greatly in external
  appearance The usual shape is steeply conical but some individuals
  are much depressed In the common varieties the outer lamina of
  shell has been removed even close to the basal edge the upfilled
  parietal tubes being thus exposed fig  b as flattened
  adpressed points These points are largest in large specimens but
  they vary somewhat in size in specimens of equal growth When the
  outer surface is preserved it is generally ribbed longitudinally
  but is sometimes quite smooth The most general colour is dirty gray
  or dark purple but many specimens are pale pinkishpurple owing
  to the exposure of the parietal tubes upfilled with shelly matter
  of this tint there are also as given under the characters of the
  vars black white and green varieties The sheath is always
  tinted by the prevailing colour The radii are rarely developed
  but generally the four sutures are distinct sometimes these are
  externally quite obliterated the shell as seen from the outside
  consisting of a single piece like a patella or fissurella When the
  radii are developed they are very narrow with their upper edges
  oblique their development seems always coincident with the more or
  less perfect preservation of the shell and their function is to
  enlarge the orifice the enlargement being usually effected by the
  disintegration and removal of the whole upper part of the conical
  shell The size of the orifice varies considerably in the seventh
  variety it was extraordinarily small in outline it varies from oval
  to rounded trigonal or rhomboidal in some specimens with the radii
  well developed it was rounded pentagonal

  SizeTetraclita porosa is the largest species of the genus
  I have seen specimens attached to a large pebble of granite in the
  British Museum which measured two inches in basal diameter and
  nearly one inch and a half in height

  Scuta these are subtriangular and generally a little elongated
  but they vary slightly in relative breadth fig  i  l and
  likewise in the degree to which the basitergal angle is rounded off
  The under surface is clouded with dull or pinkishpurple or with
  green or is nearly white The articular ridge is not prominent and
  the articular furrow is narrow The adductor ridge is prominent and
  runs upwards for some distance close and parallel to the articular
  ridge and sometimes it extends nearly or quite up to the apex of
  the valve in one single specimen the adductor ridge had an abraded
  appearance and was very little developed The crests for the rostral
  and lateral depressores are sharp and distinct Along the occludent
  margin the ends generally of the alternate lines of growth are
  enlarged into knobs serving to lock the two valves together but in
  many specimens only two or three knobs at intervals of several lines
  of growth fig  b are developed

  Terga when the upper end of the valve is not corroded there is
  a distinct beak hollow within for a thread of corium The scutal
  margin is not much inflected and the articular ridge not very
  prominent The spur is placed quite close to the basiscutal angle
  of the valve so that there is no basal margin on that side of the
  valve The width of the valve and of the spur and the acumination of
  the extremity of the latter varies in a remarkable manner In the
  broad and commonest variety fig  k the basal margin of the
  valve form an angle of about  with the carinal side of the spur
  and the basal end of the spur is broad and truncated In the less
  common and narrow variety  m the basal margin in some extreme
  cases forms very nearly a straight line with the carinal side of
  the spur and the spur itself is bluntly pointed in var  it is
  sharply pointed

  Structure of the parietes and radiiIn all cases the four sutures
  are quite distinct from top to bottom on the internal lamina of
  the shell and generally they run through the whole thickness of
  the walls and are visible externally Often they do not quite
  reach the outer lamina and then the shell externally consists of a
  single piece like a patella Sometimes the sutures can be traced
  running through the parietal tubes only for a short distance from
  the internal surface where they cease the two walls of the suture
  become fused together When a perfect suture is split open the
  radius is represented fig  h by a few narrow sinuous ridges
  sending out on each side little branches or denticuli these are
  received into corresponding furrows in the opposed compartment These
  ridges run nearly parallel to each other and somewhat obliquely
  from the outer lamina of the shell to the basis When the radii are
  developed their edges are similarly formed by sinuous denticulated
  ridges with the interspaces between them filled up solidly The al
  are but little prominent

  The mouth does not deviate from the generic type The cirri
  are remarkable from the variability in the several pairs of the
  relative numbers of their segments as shown in the following table
  The segments do not correspond even on opposite sides of the same
  individual as may be seen in the two lower lines of the table I
  believe that variability to this degree is very uncommon in other
  cirripedes though as stated in the Introduction the number of the
  segments always increases with the growth of the individual The
  terminal segments in the longer rami of both the first and third
  cirrus are antenniformedbeing elongated and of a different
  shape with fewer bristles compared with the basal segments of
  the same cirri It is apparently these terminal segments which
  are particularly liable to vary in number In both rami of the
  third cirrus some of the segments from the sixth to the eleventh
  inclusive counting from the bottom more especially the eighth
  ninth and tenth carry a few spines coarsely and doubly pectinated
  but as some of the adjoining segments carry spines which may be
  called doubly serrated it is not easy to draw an exact line of
  demarcation Sometimes though rarely a few of the nearly terminal
  segments in the second cirrus are furnished with similar doubly
  pectinated spines

  VarietiesUnder the generic description I have stated that after
  having spent some time in examining a very large suite of specimens
  of T porosa I concluded that at least four of the varieties were
  true species It so happened that all the specimens which I first
  examined of the var  rubescens had the narrow sloping terga
  and scuta with only two or three great teeth on their occludent
  margins but ultimately in a group thus characterised I found one
  or two individuals with terga precisely of the shape of those in
  var  communis Again in a group of dull purple specimens of
  var communis a few had the narrow sloping terga and scuta with
  teeth on their occludent margins intermediate in size and number
  between the varieties with only one or two great teeth and those
  with every alternate growthridge enlarged into a tooth Hence var
  rubescens completely broke down as a species

  With respect to var  elegans a MS specific name of Leach
  I inferred at first from external appearance alone that it was
  distinct the outer lamina of the shell and even the epidermis is
  preserved the surface is strongly ribbed and the whole shell
  excepting the sheath is nearly white the terga are narrow with a
  sloping basal margin as in var  rubescens Whole groups of
  specimens are thus characterised But as var communis is often
  white and as the surface when the outer lamina is preserved is
  generally as we shall presently see ribbed longitudinally the
  differences in var elegans are quite unimportant

  The th var differs from var communis only in the narrow
  radii having been developed and consequently in the orifice being
  pentagonal and in the outer longitudinally ribbed lamina of the
  shell having been preserved In the same group of specimens I have
  seen every intermediate stage between this and the common form It
  must not however be supposed that the young of var communis
  always pass through these stages for such is not the case In the
  genus Balanus it has been seen how capricious in some species is
  the development of the radii

  Of the other varieties enumerated at the beginning no further
  mention is required excepting with respect to var  the most
  singular of all I have seen only three specimens sent to me by Dr
  Aug Gould of Boston United States and these from the appearance
  of their bases I have no doubt had been attached to a shipthe
  only instance which I have met with in the present species The
  shell is steeply conical with the orifice so small as to be reduced
  to a mere pore the radii are extremely narrow and white the shell
  is thin with the surface smooth but ribbed longitudinally and
  regularly the outer lamina of the shell and the epidermis are
  perfectly preserved the upper part of the shell is reddish purple
  which dies away towards the base careful examination of the apex
  shows that at the first growth the young shell was blueishgreen
  The terga are narrow with a sloping basal margin as in var
  rubescens but with the point of the spur sharper I have formerly
  remarked that the shape of the terga seems influenced by the size
  of the orifice The lower edge of the sheath depends freely I have
  seen no other instance of this latter structure so common but so
  variable in Balanus in the present species except to a partial
  extent in one distorted specimen in Mr Stutchburys collection
  adhering to Balanus tintinnabulum and probably taken from a ships
  bottom I may add that this distorted specimen was remarkable from
  its radii being wider than in any other instancefrom its smooth
  uncoloured surface without longitudinal ribsand from the perfect
  preservation of the epidermis over its entire surface Although Dr
  Goulds specimens in external aspect are absolutely and entirely
  different from the common varieties of T porosa there are so many
  intermediate forms and the differences are so little important that
  I feel no hesitation in attributing them to variation consequent on
  the individuals having been exposed to unusual conditions attached
  to the bottom of a ship




 TETRACLITA SERRATA Pl  fig  a d

Shell dark greenishgray with narrow longitudinal serrated ribs
radii absent scutum with the adductor and articular ridges forming a
cavity which runs up to the apex of the valve

  HabCape of Good Hope Algoa Bay attached to sandstone and to
  Patell Mus Brit Cuming and Stutchbury

     I have seen three separate lots of this species all from the
    Cape of Good Hope one lot was collected by Dr Krauss at Algoa
    Bay and I strongly suspect is the species described by him in his
    Sdafrikanischen Mollusken as Conia porosa If the species
    figured by Chemnitz and mentioned in a note p  under T
    porosa be the present species the specimens probably did not
    come from Tranquebar on which point Chemnitz speaks only from
    memory I have seen one specimen ticketed New South Wales it is
    possible considering the case of T rosea that this may be
    correct but I should like to have further confirmation before
    giving it as a habitat


  General AppearanceColour dark greenish gray form steeply
  conical surface covered especially in the lower half of the shell
  by numerous narrow sharp longitudinal ridges but slightly
  prominent and serrated or transversely divided into small teeth
  when the shell has been much disintegrated the upper part of the
  surface consists of the exposed smooth rather large upfilled
  parietal tubes I have seen no instance of the development of
  the radii sometimes even the sutures are with great difficulty
  distinguishable though I believe they always reach the outer
  surface sometimes the sutures are wide from the disintegration of
  the edges of the compartments Orifice rounded or oval

  ScutaThe scuta and carinal half of the terga are blueishgreen
  In the scuta neither the articular ridge or furrow are much
  developed the adductor ridge is prominent and is united to the
  articular ridge about half way up the latter thus forming a rather
  large triangular cavity which runs up to the apex of the valve

  The Terga are beaked The spur measured across the upper part
  is half as wide as the valve it is bluntly pointed it is placed
  quite close to the basiscutal angle of the valve so that there
  is no basal margin on that side it curves towards the scutum its
  extremity extending beyond the basiscutal angle

  Structure of the Shell and RadiiThe parietal tubes are rather
  large especially those adjoining the inner lamina of the walls The
  shell is of singularly little specific gravity which is due to the
  parietal tubes not being filled up with shelly matter nearly to so
  great an extent as in the other species even in the uppermost part
  the tubes are not solidly filled up only their external sides are
  thickly coated with greenishblack shell which by corrosion becomes
  grayish The radii as stated are not developed the shell breaks
  with singular facility along the sutures and the radii are then seen
  to be most feebly represented by a few very small branching ridges
  The al have their edges plainly crenated The sheath is dark green
  with the lower edge free

  The Mouth presents no particular characters With regard to the
  Cirri I am doubtful whether any confidence can be placed in the
  numbers of the segments being constant but I may state that the
  second cirrus contained thirteen and sixteen segments in its two
  rami the third cirrus only fourteen in both rami and the sixth
  cirrus twentysix segments in both rami Whereas in every specimen
  of T porosa the longer ramus of the third cirrus contained more
  segments than either ramus of the second About half the segments
  namely those in the middle of both rami of the third cirrus are
  furnished with coarsely and doubly pectinated spines like those in
  T porosa

  AffinitiesUpon the whole this species is more nearly allied
  to T porosa than to any other In the cavity formed by the
  union of the adductor and articular ridges it is allied to T
  crulescens This species differs from all in its little specific
  gravity consequent on the parietal tubes being only slightly filled
  up and in the peculiarly serrated narrow approximate ridges on
  the external surface of the walls The character derived from the
  adductor ridge just alluded to is remarkable In the shape of the
  terga in the absence of radii and in the structure of the body
  this species approaches closely to T porosa

     I am greatly indebted to Professor Krauss for having sent
    me for examination the unique specimen collected by himself in
    Algoa Bay There can be no doubt of the identity of the African and
    Australian specimens It is a singular circumstance that the same
    species should occur in these two distant places and as far as at
    present known not in the intermediate more tropical coasts

Shell dirty white tinged with pink parietes formed by a single row
of large tubes radii generally narrow tergum with the spur rather
short and broad

  Twofold Bay South Africa Algoa Bay Attached in Australia to
  littoral rocks and shells often associated with T purpurascens
  Chthamalus antennatus and Catophragmus polymerus Mus Brit
  Cuming Krauss Darwin Stutchbury


  General AppearanceShell steeply conical often rather convex
  dirty or brownish white feebly tinted with pink external surface
  generally much disintegrated and having in the upper part a pillared
  appearance owing to the exposure of the upfilled large square
  parietal tubes and in the lower part a striated and sometimes
  serrated appearance from the exposure of the parallel approximate
  plates with which the outer lamina of the shell is internally
  strengthened In only a few young specimens the whole outer lamina
  of the shell was well preserved and in these the surface was very
  smooth and even glossy giving to the specimens a quite different
  aspect even in partially corroded specimens the lower part of the
  shell sometimes is quite smooth Generally the radii are developed
  in most specimens they are narrow but sometimes of moderate width
  their summits are oblique and their edges often notched or toothed
  The recipient furrow in each opposed compartment is often almost
  as wide as the radius itself and is equally notched In some much
  corroded specimens there were no radii Basal diameter of largest
  specimen  of an inch

  Scuta generally thick sometimes very thick with the external
  surface usually much corroded articular furrow rather wide
  articular ridge not very prominent adductor ridge prominent The
  rostral depressor muscle is attached in a small oblong pit sometimes
  including little crests and the lateral depressor muscle is attached
  to what may be described either as three or four parallel furrows or
  crests

  Terga with the spur placed close to the basiscutal angle so that
  there is no basal margin on that side spur short with its lower end
  truncated and rounded broad even exceeding when measured across
  the upper part half the width of the valve Articular furrow wide
  Apex not beaked

  Structure of Walls and RadiiThis species differs from all the
  others of the genus in having only a single row fig  d of
  parietal tubes these are large quadrangular but elongated in the
  ray of the circle They are not filled up even at the very top of
  the shell but they become thickly lined all round with compact
  shelly matter When the surface of the shell is disintegrated
  these upfilled tubes greatly affect as already stated the
  external appearance The outer lamina near the basis is internally
  strengthened by longitudinal sharp approximate ridges or plates
  which also often affect after corrosion the external appearance
  The radii have their sutural edges formed by a set of narrow
  branching ridges or septa the ends of which seen externally often
  give a notched outline to this edge the recipient furrows in the
  opposed compartments are deep and their edges likewise are often
  notched the interspaces between the branching ridges are filled up
  solidly The al have their edges coarsely crenated The lower edge
  of the sheath is not free

  The mouth and cirri present no particular characters the third
  cirrus has both its rami elongated with the terminal segment
  tapering In the three posterior pairs of cirri the tufts of little
  spines between the main pairs are rather large

  AffinitiesThis species has no particular affinity with any
  other The circumstance of there being only a single row of parietal
  tubes is not so important a difference as might at first be thought
  inasmuch as in the other species during their quite early youth the
  walls are formed of only a single row of tubes or pores

     The descriptions given by Wood and Lamarck are fuller and
    more accurate than is usual in the case of Cirripedes and I have
    no doubt regarding these two names The Conia depressa of Dr
    J E Gray is as I know from having seen the original specimens
    the young of this same species the name is unaccompanied by any
    description or figure

Shell depressed pale purple or dirty white with the surface
longitudinally ribbed or corroded and granulated radii or even
sutures none or radii well developed and broad with their summits
parallel to the basis basis membranous scutum transversely elongated
tergum small with the spur extremely short and rounded

  Diemens Land New Zealand adhering to Pollicipes spinosus
  Mus Brit Cuming Stutchbury Darwin c China  attached to
  Pollicipes mitella Mus Brit and Stutchbury Generally attached
  to tidal rocks sometimes to shells Very common


  General AppearanceShell generally much depressed in a few
  cases rather steeply conical in one single instance cylindrical
  but not much elongated Colour when alive pale but fine purple I
  presume judging from some dried specimens sometimes dirty white
  The state of the surface varies remarkably about half the specimens
  fig  a which I have seen had the outer lamina of shell quite
  removed and the surface granulated owing to the projecting and
  exposed tips of the upfilled parietal tubes the radii are not
  developed and often even there is no trace of the four sutures
  the rather large orifice is somewhat rounded and the two scuta
  with their surfaces disintegrated have their middle parts deeply
  indenting the terga The shell in the other and perhaps more common
  condition fig  b has the outer lamina preserved and is
  longitudinally ribbed with generally at least five or six ribs on
  each compartment the radii are here very wide and extend from tip
  to tip of the compartments so that their summits are parallel to the
  basis they are generally covered by a brownish epidermis thickly
  clothed with little spines the orifice is neatly diamondshaped
  the apices of the opercular valves meet at a common point these
  specimens are almost always smaller and younger than the granulated
  specimens Altogether the specimens in the two opposite states have
  in their external appearance nothing in common and no one without
  careful examination would ever suspect that they were specifically
  identical this however was proved by the intermediate forms
  and in one instance three of the compartments had their surfaces
  granulated and were entirely destitute of the radii whilst the
  fourth by some chance had been preserved from corrosion was
  longitudinally ribbed and had its epidermiscovered radius fully
  developed The difference in the appearance of the opercular valves
  in the two states is simply owing to the degradation of their upper
  parts in the granulated specimens

  The basal diameter of the largest specimen was one inch but the
  height only  of an inch

  Scuta transversely elongated so that the basal margin is nearly
  twice as long as the tergal margin articular ridge very little
  prominent articular furrow wide but shallow adductor ridge very
  blunt slightly prominent sometimes almost absent almost parallel
  to the basal margin there are no distinct crests for the rostral
  or lateral depressor muscles but some small irregular pits for the
  latter In one young specimen the lines of growth were crenated
  showing a tendency in the valve to become longitudinally striated as
  in the allied T costata In some young and immature specimens the
  basal margin was deeply sinuous

  Terga small in area not above half that of the scuta spur
  extremely short broad placed close to the basiscutal angle of the
  valve so that there is no basal margin on that side of the spur The
  lower end and sides of the spur form one uniform curve Articular
  ridge barely developed Crests for the tergal depressores sharp and
  prominent

  Structure of the Shell and RadiiThe walls are very thick and
  the parietal tubes small and numerous there are sometimes from
  twelve to fifteen rows of tubes in the thickness of the wall The
  tubes in their whole upper part are filled up solidly and as
  we have seen are often exposed by disintegration In very young
  specimens of that size in which in T porosa there would be only
  a single row of parietal tubes there were here two or three rows
  The development of the radii as we have seen is very capricious
  the sutures even sometimes being lost The radii when developed
  are broad square on the summit and covered by brownish hirsute
  epidermis internally they are formed of tubes like those forming the
  parietes in this respect differing from all the species except the
  following T costata The tubes in the radii run obliquely down
  towards the basis instead of in a transverse line directly towards
  the opposite compartment as might have been expected from the
  structure of the radii in Balanus The al have their edges finely
  crenated The sheath in all the specimens which I have observed is
  colourless its lower edge is not free The corium entering the
  parietal tubes and lining the opercular valves the mouth and the
  anterior cirri is generally of an extremely dark purple colour

  The Basis is entirely membranous in which respect this species
  differs from all the others in the genus

  Mouth all the trophi are unusually hairy or spinose The labrum is
  deeply notched and apparently destitute of teeth on the crest The
  palpi are clubshaped or enlarged at their extremities The mandibles
  have the fourth tooth rudimentary

  In the Cirri the second and third pairs are remarkably short
  and blunt In one specimen the two rami of the first cirrus had
  respectively six and sixteen segments those of the second six and
  seven those of the third seven and seven and those of the sixth
  cirrus twenty rather elongated segments with a small tuft of spines
  between each main pair of spines

  AffinitiesThis species differs from all in its membranous
  basis and in its transversely elongated scuta It resembles T
  costata and differs from all the other species in its radii
  when developed being square on the summit and in being formed of
  tubesin the smallness and number of the parietal tubesin the
  absence of crests on the under side of the scuta for the rostral
  and lateral depressor musclesin the shortness and rounded form
  of the spur to the tergaand lastly in the clubshaped palpi
  and small size or absence of the fourth tooth in the mandibles T
  purpurascens differs from T costata in those points namely in
  its membranous basis and transversely elongated scuta in which it
  differs from all the other species and moreover in its scuta not
  being plainly striated longitudinally in having more ribs on the
  external surface of the parietes of its shell and in having only
  three pairs of main spines on the three posterior cirri

longitudinal ribs radii broad with their summits parallel to the

  HabPhilippine Archipelago Mus Cuming Attached to various
  shells within the tidal limit


  General AppearanceShell whitish probably tinged when alive
  with reddishpurple depressed surface perfectly preserved smooth
  but having longitudinal very prominent ribs almost invariably ten
  in number namely three on both the rostrum and carina and two on
  the two lateral compartments with ten corresponding projections
  round the basal margin Orifice passing from roundedtrigonal to
  diamondshaped The radii are very broad and square at the summit
  and extend from tip to tip of the compartments Basal diameter of
  largest specimen under half an inch generally from  to  of an
  inch

  Scuta of the usual subtriangular shape and not transversely
  elongated as in T purpurascens External surface striated
  longitudinally in many specimens there is a medial depression or
  a row of very small pits such as occur on the scuta of Balanus
  trigonus and lvis The adductor ridge is moderately developed
  and runs nearly parallel to the occludent margin there are no crests
  for the rostral and lateral depressor muscles

  Terga these in area equal two thirds of the scuta the spur is
  short and rounded and placed as described under T purpurascens
  but the articular ridge seems to be more prominent than in that
  species

  Structure of the Shell and RadiiThe parietal tubes are small
  and very numerous as in T purpurascens The radii are wide
  square on the summits but not so conspicuously covered by hirsute
  epidermis as in that species Internally the tubes forming the radii
  are smaller and run more transversely than in T purpurascens
  that is in the normal course as in Balanus The edges of the al are
  nearly or quite smooth The Basis is as distinctly calcareous as
  in the other species of the genus

  Mouth the trophi are not so hairy as in T purpurascens the
  labrum seems destitute of teeth the palpi are clubshaped at their
  ends the mandibles have only three teeth The second and third
  cirri are not so short and blunt relatively to the others as in T
  purpurascens In the posterior cirri the elongated segments carry
  four main pairs of spines between which there is no intermediate
  tuft of fine spines

  The Affinities of this species have been fully pointed out under
  the last and closely related species In external appearance T
  costata can at first hardly be distinguished from those young and
  palecoloured varieties of T purpurascens which have their
  external surface not corroded and their radii well developed

  General AppearanceShell conical moderately steep white
  generally with a tinge of pinkishpurple in the upper part owing to
  the exposure of the tips of the upfilled parietal tubes The lower
  part of the surface is generally well preserved and is formed by
  very irregular branching longitudinal slightly prominent ridges
  Radii of moderate width with their summits oblique Orifice rather
  large rounded trigonal

  Scuta rather narrow with the upper part acuminated the external
  surface generally much disintegrated and marked with some irregular
  blotches of dark red Articular ridge not prominent articular furrow
  rather deep adductor ridge distinct from the articular ridge
  pretty well developed as are the crests for the rostral and lateral
  depressor muscles In young and well preserved scuta there is an
  external medial hyaline band corresponding with the hollow under
  the adductor ridge and caused by the thinness of the valve along
  this line

  Terga externally the carinal half is longitudinally and very
  feebly striated Internally the articular furrow is very wide but
  shallow and of unusual length owing to the preservation of the
  upper part of the valve the articular ridge is not prominent The
  spur does not actually join as in all the foregoing species the
  basiscutal angle but is separated from it by a short piece of basal
  margin its two sides are more nearly parallel than is usual and
  the end is regularly rounded It is always rather narrow though the
  width varies considerably fig  d  e It extends in the same
  straight line with the middle of the articular furrow The terga
  though not possessing any striking characters differ considerably in
  appearance from those of the other species

  Structure of the Shell and RadiiThe parietal tubes are
  remarkable from their irregular shapes and unequal sizes fig 
  bhardly two resembling each other Sometimes a single elongated
  tube will reach across the whole thickness of the walls The septa
  between the tubes are rather thick and rugged The tubes are
  generally darkly coloured from the adhering corium they are solidly
  upfilled but only in the uppermost part by dark chocolatered
  shelly matter The radii are formed by irregularly branching ridges
  with the interspaces filled up solidly The square edges of the al
  are much thicker than in any other species and are furnished with
  transverse ridges which are sometimes slightly branched The inner
  lamina of the walls near the basis in most of the specimens is
  irregularly and longitudinally ribbed the ribs being longitudinally
  striated The sheath and the upper part of the inner lamina of the
  parietes are clouded with chocolatered

  The animals Mouth and Cirri were illpreserved but I was able
  to make out that the labrum had some strong teeth and that the
  mandibles were furnished with five teeth a greater number than in
  any other species The palpi had parallel sides as usual In the
  sixth cirrus the segments had four pairs of main spines instead of
  the usual number of three

  AffinitiesThis species does not appear to be particularly
  related to any other one perhaps it is rather nearer to the two
  following than to the foregoing species The irregular parietal
  tubes thickedged al form of terga five teeth to the mandibles
  and four pairs of spines to the segments of the posterior cirri are
  its chief characteristics

    tintinnabulum from the East Indies and more especially the
    expression Valvul operculi cardine dentato mobilis apparently
    referring to the highly prominent articular ridge of the scutum
    leave little doubt on my mind that I have rightly named the present
    species

Shell with the upper part tinged greenishblue longitudinally ribbed

  General AppearanceShell conical sometimes depressed surface
  with rather broad smooth longitudinal ridges whitish with the
  upper part greenishblue sometimes very feebly tinted with pink
  radii white or mottled with blueishgreen or with pink When the
  outer lamina of shell has been corroded the upfilled parietal tubes
  of a dull blueishgray colour are exposed The radii are moderately
  wide with their summits very oblique In basal diameter one
  specimen was  and another  of an inch

  Scuta externally furrowed very slightly in a longitudinal
  direction causing the lines of growth to become a little sinuous
  The valve is strong and thick and the epidermis when preserved
  is hirsute with spines The articular ridge is extraordinarily
  prominent it projects as measured from the external surface of
  the valve to an amount equalling half the width of the valve in
  its widest part The adductor ridge is very short and is united
  to the bottom of the articular ridge thus forming a small nearly
  cylindrical tube which runs up to near the apex of the valve The
  inflected occludent margin is broad and coarsely toothed The crests
  for both depressor muscles are not very prominent When the scuta
  and terga are articulated together owing to the great projection of
  the articular ridge of the scutum its upper part is separated from
  the tergum fig  b by a remarkably wide and deep fissurelike
  hollow The scutum in some distorted specimens from a ships bottom
  was narrow in proportion to its ordinary breadth

  TergaThese are large Externally there is a broad longitudinal
  depression bounded on each side by a ridge The carinal half is
  feebly striated longitudinally A large upper portion fig  b
  projects freely and stands when the two valves are articulated
  together above the apex of the scutum but does not form a beak as
  in T porosa Internally the tergal margin is widely inflected
  the articular furrow is very deep but the articular ridge is not
  prominent The spur is not very broad it is separated from the
  basiscutal angle by a small space of basal margin which forms a
  straight line with the basal margin on the opposite side of the spur
  The end of the spur is truncated and is parallel to the basal margin

  Structure of the Shell and RadiiThe walls are thick the
  parietal tubes are rather large and regular they become solidly
  filled up in their upper parts The sutural edges of the radii are
  formed by unusually narrow sinuous ridges sending off delicate
  denticuli on each side the interspaces between these ridges are
  solidly filled up The crenated edges of the al are rather thick
  Neither the mouth nor the cirri offer any noticeable character
  but I may observe that in the mandibles the third and fourth teeth
  are close together and that in the three posterior cirri the tufts
  of small spines between the main pairs are small

  AffinitiesThis species is very distinct from the others with
  the exception of the following T radiata to which it is in
  several respects allied The under side of the scutum with its great
  articular ridge and the cylindrical tube formed by the union of the
  latter with the short adductor ridge affords the most noticeable
  character

   LYONSII G B Sowerby Genera of Recent and Fossil Shells
        Plate  sine descript

     The synonymy of this species is complicated De Blainville
    gives no description under the article Conia published in  or
    in the vol published in  but I believe from the figures of
    the opercular valves that I have correctly identified this species
    with his C radiata Mr Sowerby gives no description of C
    Lyonsii or any figure of the opercular valves but his drawing
    of the shell is much better than de Blainvilles and I believe
    it is the same species Whether de Blainvilles or Sowerbys
    plate appeared first I cannot ascertain In the second edition of
    Lamarck Conia radiata of Blainville is given as a synonym to
    Balanus radiatus of that work but this is quite erroneous I
    may add that if de Blainvilles name does not apply to the present
    species it must to T crulescens and as the latter is the
    older name it will be permanent In this case T radiata might
    be allowed to stand as my own name considering that Mr Sowerbys
    figure is imperfect and is not accompanied by any description
    At first I thought that the present species might be the Lepas
    mitra of Spengler Skrivter af Naturhist Selskabet 
    Tab  fig  but the parietes are not described as porose
    and the folds on the walls are too broad on the other hand his
    description of the opercular valves makes me think this may be the
    same species

  General AppearanceShell white rather steeply conical with

  the walls in a specimen half an inch in diameter there were from
  eight to twelve ribs on each compartment The outer lamina of shell
  seems always well preserved Orifice rounded trigonal Radii white
  smooth broad with their summits only slightly oblique I have
  seen one specimen  in basal diameter but quarter of an inch is
  a common size and very young specimens are unusually frequent in
  collections

  Scuta broad externally not striated longitudinally The articular
  ridge is prominent and the furrow deep but not in so great a
  degree as in T crulescens The adductor ridge is only slightly
  prominent it extends upwards only a little way above the lower end
  of the articular ridge and does not form with the latter a cavity
  There are no crests for the rostral depressor muscle but there is a
  little pit formed by the folding over of the occludent margin

  TergaThese valves when articulated with the scuta fig  b
  project above them to an extraordinary degree and are separated
  from them by a deep fissurelike hollow caused by the remarkable
  prominence of the articular ridge of the terga The upper part of
  the tergum is not beaked and does not project freely much above the
  sack The valve is large externally there is a rounded longitudinal
  furrow The tergal margin is broadly inflected The articular furrow
  is deep and the articular ridge far more prominent than in any other
  sessile cirripede for it projects as measured from the outside
  surface more than half the width of the valve and consequently
  the valve when viewed vertically from above almost appears as if
  formed by the union of three plates viz the articular ridge and
  the outside surface on each side of the spur The spur is of moderate
  width with the corners rounded it is placed near but not close to
  the basiscutal angle so that there is on this side a small portion
  of basal margin forming nearly a straight line with the margin on
  the carinal side In some young specimens about the tenth of an
  inch in diameter from the West Indies and from New South Wales the
  spur the position of which I found varied a little in some other
  specimens was placed nearly in the middle of the valve and very
  nearly at right angles to the basal margin it is possible that these
  may be a distinct species but without larger specimens to judge
  from I think it more probable that this difference in the tergum is
  due to variation and youth

  Structure of Shell and RadiiThe parietal tubes are commonly
  elongated in the ray of the circle the septa are rather thick and
  strongly crenated at their basal edges The inner lamina of the
  walls is strongly ribbed longitudinally The broad radii have their
  sutural edges formed by ridges with numerous and closely approximate
  denticuli the interspaces between the main ridges are not soon
  filled up and at the bottom each interspace usually terminates in
  a pore or tube so that the radii are not solid as in most of the
  foregoing species but porose The al have their edges crenated

  Basis calcareous of unusual thickness the inner or upper
  surface is striated from the centre in rays corresponding with the
  ribs on the inner lamina of the walls This striated or furrowed
  structure in the basis shows a tendency to its becoming tubular or
  porose as may be inferred from analogous cases in Balanus

  Animals body unknown

  AffinitiesThis species is rather more closely allied to the last
  than to any other There is a close analogy in the peculiar manner
  in which the scuta and terga are articulated together in the two
  species in this species it is effected by the great development of
  the articular ridge of the tergum and in T crulescens by that
  of the scutum The internally striated calcareous basis and the
  internal tubular interspaces between the denticulated ridges of the
  radii are peculiar characters The white colour the narrowly and
  closely ribbed parietes and the broad radii give this species an
  aspect by which it can be easily recognised




 GenusELMINIUS

  ELMINIUS Leach Zoological Journal vol  July 

Compartments four parietes not porose Basis membranous

  Distribution Southern temperate seas


General AppearanceShell conical with a strong tendency in most
of the species to become cylindrical orifice generally large Walls
either thin and smooth or thick and plicated longitudinally Colours
various pale purple greenish white and in E plicatus owing to
the exposure of an intermediate lamina of shell bright orangeyellow
Radii either of considerable width with their summits oblique and
rounded as in the first two species of the genus or very narrow as
in the last two species Elminius plicatus is the largest species
and is sometimes one inch in basal diameter The outer surface of this
latter species is occasionally much corroded

Scuta these are of the usual shape in E Kingii and modestus
there is no adductor ridge and no crests for the depressor muscles
in E plicatus and simplex on the other hand there is a well
developed adductor ridge and crests for the lateral depressor muscles
in some individuals also of E plicatus there are small crests for
the rostral depressores

The Terga are remarkable for their variability in all the species
in many specimens of E Kingii and modestus the basal margin on
the carinal side of the spur is deeply hollowed out The width and
acumination of the spur varies in all the species In E plicatus and
simplex this valve is remarkably like that of Tetraclita porosa In
some specimens of E Kingii the terga and scuta are firmly calcified
together

Structure of the Parietes and RadiiAs in Tetraclita the two
lateral compartments are necessarily broad The parietes are never
porose but consist in appearance of a single layer of shell In E
modestus the basal internal edges of the parietes are smooth but in
the other species they are striated longitudinally with short ridges
or sometimes with subcylindrical projections In those specimens of
E plicatus which have externally suffered much corrosion the walls
have been rendered extremely thick by the inward production of these
ridges or plates and in this case the ridges are not confined to the
basal edges but extend upwards close to the sheath The basal surfaces
of the walls in these latter specimens resemble those of Chelonobia
but the walls in that genus have an internal lamina which here is not
the case The radii are wide in E Kingii and of moderate width in
E modestus with their summits oblique and smoothly rounded and
their sutural edges not in the least crenated In E simplex they
are extremely narrow smoothedged and rounded in E plicatus they
are narrow and in this species alone the sutural edge is sinuous and
sends inwards short ridges or teeth The al in all the species except
this last are likewise smoothedged The lower edge of the sheath
depends more or less freely in all the species except in E Kingii

Basis membranous in all four species In E modestus the true
basal membrane is extremely thin and is divided into concentric slips
on its inner surface there are attached numerous cementducts varying
from  to  of an inch in diameter repeatedly trifurcating
rarely forming hexagonal or quadrangular loops and with the branches
placed approximately parallel to each other Beneath the true basal
membrane there is a complicated layer of cement in the form of a
network or of separate tubes or in beads and patches In E Kingii
the basal membrane presented a wonderfully complicated appearance in
part due to the cement forming a mass of inosculating fibres many of
these fibres seemed to end in circular discs of cement

Neither the Mouth or Cirri offer any noticeable generic characters
as distinct from Balanus and several other genera The Branchi
in E plicatus are well developed and moderately plicated In E
modestus they are small not plicated but with a rounded sinuous
margin in a specimen having a basal diameter of  the branchi
in total length were only  of an inch At the bottom of the sack
I observed some inwardly pointed tapering filaments such as occur in
Balanus In this same species I measured the ova which were unusually
elongated being  in length I may add that the probosciformed
penis was actually thrice the length of the animals body in some small
but mature specimens with ova having a shell with a basal diameter
of  of an inch

Distribution and HabitatsThis genus is remarkable inasmuch as it
is not distributed over the whole globe three of the species occur
very commonly on the shores of New South Wales Van Diemens Land
and New Zealand not extending as far as I can judge much north of
Sydney the fourth species is confined to South America ranging
from the Falkland Islands and Tierra del Fuego as far north as
Chiloe Elminius therefore appears to be strictly a southern genus
Elminius Kingii and modestus represent each other on the American
and Australian continents so I believe E plicatus in New Zealand
represents E simplex in New South Wales and Van Diemens Land
The species are all attached to tidal rocks and shells E Kingii
is sometimes attached to floating wood At the Falkland Islands the
lastmentioned species adhered to some rocks in a running brook of
fresh water at most eighteen inches under highwater mark so that for
the greater part of each tide it was exposed to absolutely fresh water
At Sydney I found E modestus adhering to oysters in a muddy lagoon
almost separated from the sea and apparently very unfavorable for
cirripedes

AffinitiesThis genus can be distinguished from Tetraclita only
by the four compartments not being porose and by the basis being
always membranous whereas in Tetraclita purpurascens alone it is
membranous Elminius Kingii and modestus on the one hand are
closely allied together as are E simplex and plicatus on the
other hand The lastnamed species in the characters of its opercular
valves and in its shell comes nearest to Tetraclita In T rosea we
have seen that there is only a single row of parietal tubes and the
outer lamina of the shell is strengthened as indeed it is in most of
the other species of the genus and in Balanus by small longitudinal
plates or ridges which are similar and homologous to those on the
internal basal edges of the parietes in three of the species of
Elminius so that the difference in the structure of the parietes in
Tetraclita and Elminius is small

  HabTierra del Fuego Falkland Islands Chiloe Attached to tidal
  rocks and sometimes to floating timber Mus Brit Darwin c


  General AppearanceShell fragile either steeply conical with a
  large orifice or subcylindrical surface smooth grayish or white
  with large portions covered by pale brown epidermis Radii broad with
  their summits oblique smooth slightly arched exhibiting a large
  surface of the al The al usually have their summits much less
  oblique than those of the radii the portion added during diametric
  growth is of a dead white colour The growth ridges on the scuta
  are very little prominent and are crossed by a very obscure band
  of blueishgray The largest specimen which I have seen was  in
  basal diameter and the longest cylindrical variety  of an inch in
  height

  The Scuta are remarkable for not having any adductor ridge or
  crests for the depressor muscles the articular ridge is prominent
  but it is short not extending down half the valve I have mentioned
  under the genus that in many specimens at the Falkland Islands the
  scuta and terga were calcified together

  The Terga are rather small the basal margin on the carinal side
  of the spur is always hollowed out but to a very variable degree
  as may be seen in the three figures  c e this margin is
  generally dentated with one or two little points and an inner lamina
  of shell sometimes depends beneath the outer lamina to which the
  opercular membrane is attached as may be seen in the figure  d
  of the external surface of the valve The crests for the depressor
  muscles are well developed The tergal margin is broadly inflected
  and the articular ridge prominent making the articular furrow deep
  The spur is rather narrow and is either  d  e bluntly or
  sharply pointed The basal margin on the scutal side of the spur is
  hollowed out but to a variable depth

  Structure of the Parietes and RadiiThe parietes are thin at
  their internal basal edges they are finely striated in longitudinal
  lines The radii are solid with quite smooth edges they are
  generally covered by the epidermis The sutural edges of the al are
  likewise smooth these are added to largely during the diametric
  growth and their summits as already stated are much less oblique
  than the summits of the radii The internal surface of the shell
  is smooth and is tinted pale dull purple The lower edge of the
  sheath can hardly be said to be free The carinal margins of the
  compartments project a little inwards

  Mouth the labrum is deeply notched and supports five little teeth
  on each side the palpi are thickly clothed with spines on their
  inner sides the mandibles have five or only four teeth the maxill
  are notched and the outer maxill bilobed

  Cirri the first pair has one ramus nearly twice as long as the
  other The three posterior cirri are elongated and each segment
  supports five or six pairs of long spines with a few minute
  intermediate bristles




 ELMINIUS MODESTUS Pl  fig  a e

Shell folded longitudinally greenish or white radii of moderate
breadth smooth edged scutum without an adductor ridge tergum narrow
with the spur confluent with the basiscutal angle

  HabNew South Wales Van Diemens Land New Zealand very
  commonly attached to littoral shells and rocks associated with
  Balanus trigonus and vestitus Mus Brit Cuming Stutchbury
  Darwin


  General AppearanceShell conical generally rather steep
  occasionally depressed walls longitudinally folded sometimes very
  deeply sometimes only to a slight degree colour dull greenish or
  white Radii of moderate width with their summits very oblique
  smooth and slightly arched al much exposed with their summits
  less oblique than those of the radii the portion added to the al
  during the diametric growth differs much in appearance from the other
  portion The scuta have the growth ridges but little prominent
  they are crossed by a faint longitudinal band of gray The largest
  specimen out of the many which I have seen was under  of an inch
  in basal diameter

  Scuta destitute of an adductor ridge and of crests for the
  depressor muscles the articular ridge is moderate but the
  articular furrow is rather wide the internal occludent margin is
  much thickened The Terga are narrow and small they are somewhat
  variable in shape caused by the degree to which the basal margin is
  hollowed out fig  c e and likewise by the extent to which
  the upper end of the valve has been worn away No spur is apparent
  for it is confluent with the basiscutal angle of the valve The
  articular ridge is very prominent and runs down to the basiscutal
  angle and as the valve in this part is extremely narrow with the
  spur not developed it here assumes a channelled structure The
  basicarinal corner of the valve is furnished with rather feeble
  crests for the depressor muscles and in those varieties in which the
  basal margin is much hollowed out this part is remarkably narrow

  Structure of the Parietes and RadiiThe internal basal edges of
  the parietes and the sutural edges of the radii and al are all
  smooth The lower edge of the sheath depends freely In the green
  varieties the colour is most distinct on the internal surface of the
  shell The four compartments separate very easily when the shell has
  been ill preserved in spirits or after a very short immersion in
  caustic potash

  Mouth as in E Kingii excepting that there are only three teeth
  on each side of the notch which is deeper on the labrum The cirri
  resemble those of E Kingii the segments in the sixth pair are
  equally elongated and bear five or six pairs of spines

  AffinitiesThis species is closely allied to its South American
  representative E Kingii the differences consist in its smaller
  size often greenish colour more folded walls and narrower radii
  the internal basal edges also of the parietes are here smooth
  instead of being striated as in E Kingii The terga present even
  more obvious differences in their narrowness channelled under
  surface and in the absence of the spur or more properly in its
  confluence with the basiscutal angle of the valve




 ELMINIUS PLICATUS Pl  fig  a f

  ELMINIUS PLICATUS J E Gray Appendix to Dieffenbachs Travels in
        New Zealand p  

Shell deeply folded longitudinally corroded coloured in parts
orange radii very narrow with their edges sinuous and slightly
dentated scutum having an adductor ridge

  HabNew Zealand New South Wales Attached to rocks often
  coated by Chamsipho columna Mus Brit and Cuming


  General AppearanceShell tubuloconical or conical rarely
  depressed strong rugged coloured in parts bright orange deeply
  plicated longitudinally but with the upper parts corroded and
  smooth Orifice large The sutures are indistinct and almost
  obliterated the radii when most developed are narrow Some
  specimens have their whole surface deeply corroded in which case
  they are finely striated longitudinally or pitted and are of a
  gray or brown colour The largest specimens are one inch in basal
  diameter but one depressed specimen was  in diameter another was
  rather under one inch in diameter and one inch in height

  Scuta beginning with the common tubuloconical and not much
  corroded specimens the valve fig  c is moderately elongated
  but in a rather variable degree A prominent adductor ridge runs
  from a little above a middle point of the basal margin along
  the slightly prominent articular ridge the articular furrow
  is moderately wide There are distinct crests for the lateral
  depressores In the conical corroded specimens the scuta fig 
  e are considerably broader with the articular ridge much more
  prominent and the furrow wider in one such specimen there were
  crests for the rostral depressor muscle

  The Terga in the commoner variety resemble those of Tetraclita
  porosa the spur adjoins the basiscutal angle of the valve the
  articular ridge is moderately prominent and the furrow moderately
  deep The valve is beaked with an unusually large internal tube
  for the thread of corium the beak however is often worn away In
  the depressed much corroded specimens the terga fig  f like
  the scuta are broader and shorter than in the commoner variety
  and the spur more especially is broader The scutal margin is much
  more widely inflected and the articular ridge much more prominent
  consequently the articular furrow is much deeper

  Structure of the parietes and radiiThe orange or yolkofegg
  colour which is so conspicuous a character in the present species
  is due to a layer of shell between the inner and outer lamina and
  is exposed only by the corrosion of the latter Hence the very base
  of the shell is not of this colour nor are the uppermost and still
  more deeply corroded portions for here the orangecoloured layer has
  been removed The sheath is orangecoloured and the operculum to a
  certain extent is similarly tinted The epidermis on the parietes
  where preserved quite close to the basis supports remarkably strong
  spines about th of an inch in length The basal internal edges
  of the walls are rather coarsely striated with irregular short ridges
  and subcylindrical points and the walls in most of the specimens
  are regularly and deeply folded which with the little ridges gives
  the appearance represented in fig  b Pl  I have stated
  under the Genus that in the corroded and depressed specimens the
  walls are rendered extremely thick by the inward production and
  upward extension of these same ridges and points the under surface
  of the shell acquiring almost the appearance of Chelonobia caretta
  The Radii are often not developed even the sutures being obscure
  when most developed they are narrow with the outer lamina along the
  growing edge sinuous giving to the sutures a crenated appearance
  The sinuosities on the growing edge generally send inwards short
  ridges or septa like those on the sutural edges of the radii in most
  Balanid but of which there is no trace in the other species of
  Elminius In very minute colourless specimens about the th of
  an inch in diameter the radii are quite smoothedged The al have
  their edges strongly crenated The lower edge of the sheath depends
  freely

  Mouth the labrum shows some tendency to be bullate the notch is
  broad and shallow the palpi have a thick brush of bristles on their
  inner sides The mandibles have four or five teeth In the maxill
  the upper spines above the broad notch are very strong In the outer
  maxill the two lobes are widely separated

  Cirri in the first pair one ramus is about one fifth longer
  than the other In the third pair the posterior ramus is one
  fourth longer than the anterior ramus and its terminal segments
  are tapering each having a single circle of bristles the other
  segments and those of the shorter ramus support many coarsely
  pectinated spines In the sixth cirrus the segments are protuberant
  in front and carry four pairs of stout spines with a tuft of fine
  bristles between them

  AffinitiesThis species differs considerably from the first two
  of the genus In several characters it approaches nearer than the
  other species to Tetraclita especially to T porosanamely
  in the scutum having an adductor ridge and crests for the lateral
  depressores in the whole form of the tergum in the thick walls
  liable to much corrosion in the narrow radii and in their edges
  as well as those of the al being crenated and lastly in the
  character of the cirri more especially of the third pair with
  its coarsely pectinated spines It also approaches in all its
  characters Balanus imperator and flosculus

smoothedged scutum having an adductor ridge

This species of which I have seen specimens from the above three
localities all exactly agreeing with each other is perhaps the
Australian representative of E plicatus which seems to be confined
to New Zealand In all essential points it comes so near that
species that I shall make the greater part of my description
comparative

     I am bound to state that I have seen two specimens of E
    plicatus marked Sydney and one marked Moreton Bay but in both
    cases the collectors had visited New Zealand so that a wrong
    habitat by mistake might easily have got attached to the specimens
    in question

  General AppearanceIn external appearance there is considerable
  difference from E plicatus for E simplex is generally of a
  regular conical shape of a dirtywhite colour with the surface well
  preserved having moderately wide not very prominent longitudinal
  ribs The orifice is rather small and pentagonal The radii are
  extremely narrow or linear with quite smooth edges the sutures
  however are always very distinct and in the upper part the al
  are generally rather widely exposed as viewed from the outside
  The largest specimen which I have seen was  of an inch in basal
  diameter

  The opercular valves are closely similar to those of E plicatus
  but the scutum is generally a little more elongated and the
  articular furrow not so deep in accordance with this last fact
  the articular ridge in the tergum is not so prominent as in E
  plicatus but we have seen that these several characters are highly
  variable in E plicatus The slope of the basal margin of the
  tergum towards the spur varies in the present species in a strictly
  analogous manner as it does in Tetraclita porosa

  Structure of the Parietes and RadiiThe parietes are not so thick
  as in E plicatus internally they are tinted pale purple when
  broken transversely a row of microscopically minute orangecoloured
  dots can generally be distinguished between the outer and inner
  lamin and these evidently represent the orangecoloured layer in
  E plicatus The sheath also exhibits a faint tinge of orange The
  radii are very narrow and are quite smoothedged differently from
  in E plicatus The edges of the al barely exhibit a trace of
  being crenated

  In the body I could perceive no difference from E plicatus
  excepting that in the third pair of cirri the two rami are like each
  other and do not support any coarsely pectinated only serrated
  spines but after what we have seen on the variability of these very
  same characters in Tetraclita porosa I dare not trust to them The
  three posterior pairs of cirri also seem here to be more elongated
  in proportion to the others than in E plicatus

  AffinitiesIt is certain that this species is most closely allied
  to E plicatus but as I have seen many specimens of the latter
  brought by different persons from New Zealand and as I have observed
  in them no approach to the characters of E simplex which in
  specimens from three localities also appear to be constant I have
  considered the two forms as specifically distinct The present
  species differs from E plicatus in its white conical moderately
  ribbed well preserved smaller shell and more especially in the
  orangecoloured intermediate lamina of E plicatus being here
  represented only by microscopically minute dots But the radii being
  smoothedged is the most important differential character though in
  E plicatus during its earliest growth whilst still immature and
  colourless the radii are likewise smoothedged

    name that fertile source of error in nomenclature having been
    used

Shell formed of a single piece basis cupformed or subcylindrical
attached to corals

  Distribution imbedded in corals chiefly in the tropical seas
  round the world


I feel no hesitation in including the above several genera in one
genus In external appearance the P monticulari Pl  fig 
a which forms the genus Daracia of Gray is the most distinct but
it is so intimately allied to the two indeed to the three foregoing
species that it cannot be separated from them Of the first five
species P grande conjugatum and cancellatum form a graduated
series but with the steps very distinct the chief difference being
in the length of the spur of the tergum for the fact of the scutum
and tergum being calcified together in P grande and conjugatum
and distinct in P cancellatum is certainly unimportant as may
be inferred from what we shall see in comparing together the last
four species of the genus and from what we shall see in Creusia
spinulosa The three abovementioned graduated species are connected
with the last four species of the genus by several points of
resemblance between P grande and crenatum The first two species
namely P Anglicum and Stokesii are the most closely related
together and may indeed possibly be identical these two in all the
characters derived from the opercular valves resemble Balanus and
other ordinary forms and for this very reason they have some claims
to be generically separated from the other species of Pyrgoma for in
these latter the opercular valves seem to have broken loose from all
law presenting a greater diversity in character than do all the other
species of Balanin and Chthamalin taken together

General AppearanceThe shell consists of a single piece generally
without any suture even on the internal surface and this is the case
at least in P Anglicum in extremely young colourless specimens
nevertheless in some specimens of this very species and of P
conjugatum there were traces of two but only two sutures on the
sheath one on each side towards its carinal end The shell is much
depressed or actually flat and I have seen specimens even slightly
concave in P Anglicum however the shell is steeply conical The
outline is generally oval but in P monticulari it is extremely
irregular The surface is generally furnished with more or less
prominent ridges radiating from the orifice which is oval and small
sometimes as in P monticulari excessively small The colour is
white or pinkishpurple Most of the species are small but I have
seen specimens of P grande three quarters of an inch in diameter in
the longer axis and including the deep almost tubular basis more
than three inches in length or depth

Opercular ValvesIn three species viz P conjugatum Pl 
fig  c grande and monticulari the scuta and terga on
each side are calcified together so perfectly that there is no trace
of a suture or line of junction in P millepor these valves are
generally slightly calcified together but with the suture distinct
The Scuta differ so much in shape in the different species that
little can be said of them in common in P Anglicum and Stokesii
they resemble those of Balanus but in the other species they are
much more elongated than is usual and this is carried to an extreme
in the last four species this elongation is due to a great increase
in breadth as may be inferred from the position of the apex of the
valve and from the direction of the lines of growth But the two most
remarkable characters are firstthe extraordinary development of
the adductor ridge so that in P conjugatum cancellatum Pl
 fig  c grande and crenatum it extends considerably
beneath the basal margin being produced in the first two species at
the rostral angle into a point at the tergal end of the valve the
adductor ridge when thus much developed blends into the articular
ridge The second very remarkable character is the addition of a
special ledge along the occludent margin of the scutum and along the
carinal margin of the tergum which I will call the occludent ledges
limbus occludens and which serve to close the orifice leading
into the sack The occludent ledge is small in P grande and is
clothed with thick yellow spines giving it a brushlike appearance
in P crenatum and dentatum it is largely developed the ledge on
the scutum being articulated with that on the tergum as shown in Pl
 fig  a  bthe ledges being here and elsewhere marked
by little bristly points In P monticulari however this ledge
arrives at its maximum development Pl  fig  f the rest of
the valve the scuta and terga being here as in P grande calcified
together being reduced to a mere basal edge or border Excepting for
the adductor muscle the depressions or crests for the other muscles
both on the scuta and terga are hardly developed

Terga these as in the case of the scuta differ so much in shape
in the several species that little can be said of them in common
In P Anglicum and Stokesii they are of the normal shape in
P cancellatum Pl  fig  d this to a certain extent is
likewise the case but the spur is produced to a quite extraordinary
length In P grande Pl  fig  b there is no distinct spur
and the whole valve is square In P millepor  f there is no
spur and the valve is arched and triangular In P crenatum the spur
is broad rounded and depressed fig  b with the carinobasal
portion of the valve reduced to a mere border barely distinguishable
from the great occludent ledge In P monticulari there is no spur
and the whole valve forms a mere border to the occludent ledge and
lastly in P dentatum the valve is extremely variable in shape
fig  c  d  f and on its internal surface fig  g
there is an inwardly projecting most singular and anomalous tooth
Hence we see how wonderfully variable the terga are in this genus

Structure of the WallsThe shell consisting as has been stated
of a single piece is generally thick From the close alliance between
this genus and Creusia it is probable that the shell if examined
immediately after the metamorphosis would be found to show traces
of being formed of four compartments The walls are either solid
or porose their basal margin is formed by strong crenated ridges
answering to the longitudinal septa in Balanus but these in P
monticulari are modified into a very irregular surface The internal
surface of the shell is generally smooth or only slightly ribbed The
sheath has its lower edge free in P Anglicum and Stokesii and
in a slight degree in P millepor but in the other species it is
closely attached to the walls In P monticulari the sheath might
easily be overlooked In P Anglicum grande and crenatum it
descends almost to the basal margin of the depressed shell and as the
opercular valves and membrane are attached to the lower edge of the
sheath the animals body necessarily comes to be almost exclusively
lodged in the cupformed basis In P grande and conjugatum the
lines of growth in the sheath are bent upwards on each side at points
corresponding with the line of union between the scutum and tergum in
a manner I have not seen in any other cirripede and this sometimes
gives the appearance of two lateral sutures I may here remark that
the manner of growth in Pyrgoma is almost the converse of that in
Balanus Tetraclita and other allied genera for in these latter the
basis increases in diameter and the shell chiefly in height whilst in
Pyrgoma the shell from being so flat increases almost exclusively in
diameter whereas it is the basal cup which is added to in height or
depth

BasisThis in all the species is more or less regularly cupformed
or subcylindrical In P grande it penetrates the coral to a
surprising depth in P monticulari it is irregular in outline
corresponding with the shell The basis is generally almost wholly
imbedded in the coral but this is not the case with P Anglicum
in which the basis is generally exserted as it is in a slight degree
in P grande The shelly layer forming the basis in most of the
species is very thin and is finely plicated owing to its edge
folding between the ridges or septa that form the basal edges of the
shell this is very conspicuous in P cancellatum The basis is not
permeated by pores except in P Anglicum In some sessile cirripedes
a cleft covered only by membrane may be observed all round between
the lower edge of the shell and the basis a cleft of this nature
is rather conspicuous in P crenatum so that small portions of
the septa on the internal surface of the walls can be seen from the
outside In P monticulari an analogous structure developed to an
extreme degree presents a very different and unique appearance the
shell is nearly flat and the smooth outer lamina does not nearly reach
to the circumference a wide border being thus left exposed which is
roughened Pl  fig  a  c  d  e by the exposure of
the irregular septa I have not seen a fresh specimen but there cannot
be a doubt that this border is properly covered by membrane

Animals BodyFrom some cause perhaps from the corals in which
the species of Pyrgoma are imbedded long remaining damp the internal
organs are generally badly preserved I have received in spirits of
wine only P Anglicum but I have examined dry specimens in a
tolerable condition of P millepor and crenatum As neither
the mouth nor cirri in these three species offer any noticeable
characters distinct from those in Balanus or Acasta my ignorance of
these organs in the other six species is not important In the above
three species the labrum is deeply notched with about three teeth on
each side of the notch except in P millepor in which the number
is six In all the mandibles have five teeth the two lower ones being
small the maxill are not notched the outer maxill are bilobed In
the Cirri the rami in the first pair are very unequal in length
the segments being slightly protuberant in the shorter ramus On the
segments of the posterior cirri there are four pairs of spines in P
Anglicum and three pairs of which the second and third are short
in P millepor At the dorsal basis of the penis there is a small
straight projecting point

AffinitiesThe species with the exception of the first two are
much more distinct from each other and more easily determined than
is usual with sessile cirripedes it is however quite useless to
attempt naming the species without disarticulating and cleaning the
opercular valves Although these valves differ so greatly in some of
the species from those of Balanus and the allied forms the genus
itself as a whole does not differ much except in the shell not being
divided into compartments and in the basis being cupformed and not
generally permeated by poresthese latter characters being in common
with Acasta With respect to the absence of separate compartments
it should be remembered that in the same species of Tetraclita we
have individuals with the four compartments distinct and furnished
with radii and other individuals without any trace of a suture
externallythe outer lamina of shell though not the inner having
become completely confluent all round At the commencement of this
description when giving my reasons for uniting the several proposed
genera into one genus I gave a sketch of the affinities of the
species I have only to add that the following subgenus Creusia is
closely perhaps too closely allied to Pyrgoma

Geographical and Geological DistributionMost of the species are
inhabitants of the hot coralgrowing zones in both the eastern and
western hemispheres but more especially as it would appear in the
East Indian Archipelago From the habits of the corals most of the
species must be inhabitants of shallow water Pyrgoma Anglicum
however is an inhabitant of deep water on the southern shores of
England whereas at St Jago in the Cape de Verde Islands I myself
collected it adhering to a Caryophyllia within the tidal limits This
same species existed on the shores of England during the Coralline Crag
period and at this epoch it attained a larger size than at present
Two species of the genus according to Sismonda are found in the
tertiary beds of Piedmont Mr Stutchbury who is so well acquainted
with recent cirripedes informs me that he has for many years examined
fossil Secondary corals in the expectation of finding imbedded
species of this genus or of some allied form but without success The
same species of Pyrgoma is by no means always confined to the same
coral I have seen P crenatum on four or five different corals
and P Anglicum on at least three kinds on the other hand I have
seen P millepor only on the Millepora complanata a member
as I believe of the vegetable kingdom and P monticulari on a
Monticularia from near Singapore

  exserted but in the Coralline Crag specimens it is almost wholly

  those on the shell The largest recent specimen which I have seen
  from St Jago was  of an inch in basal diameter but some few of
  the British specimens are nearly as large and one of the fossils
  from the Coralline Crag a little larger

  The Scuta and Terga are of the ordinary shape of these valves in

  which is reddish and extends far down the walls seems always to
  project freely In several specimens there were on each side at

subtriangular

  HabImbedded in the Mycedia Agaricia agaricites therefore from
  the West Indies Brit Mus and Stutchbury

     I am greatly indebted to Mr Dana for having named for me the
    coral in which this species was imbedded and informing me that it
    is a West Indian species


This species comes so close to the last that I am not sure that I have
acted rightly in retaining it but I think that it is distinct and in
this case it is the representative on the other side of the Atlantic
of P Anglicum of our own side It will be sufficient to point out
the few points of difference The shell is much more depressed with
the orifice oval larger and not so narrow It is apparently of a
paler red and the radiating ribs perhaps not so prominent The basis
offers the most important difference being deeply imbedded in the
coral and there is not the least appearance of the thin shelly layer
of which it is composed being permeated by pores as we have seen
is always the case with P Anglicum As in this latter species
the sheath here depends freely The opercular valves are closely
similar but in the scutum the adductor ridge occupies a rather more
central position and in the tergum the basal margin is more inclined
towards or forms a greater angle with the spur these differences by
themselves I consider quite insufficient to characterise a species
but conjoined with the flatter shell the larger orifice the more
deeply imbedded and nonporose basis they may I think be admitted as
specific In dimensions this species seems to attain a slightly larger
size than P Anglicum for several specimens were  of an inch in
diameter

  Mus Brit and Cuming

     In this case I am again indebted to Mr Dana for naming the
    coral he informs me that the genus is found in the Pacific and
    East Indies the specimen sent he believes is the G cinerascens


  Appearance and Structure of ShellShell nearly flat sometimes
  tinted dull dirty purple with the surface marked by slight broad
  approximate ridges the ends of which form considerable projections
  giving to the shell when not too much encrusted by coral a lobed
  border In young specimens  of an inch in diameter some of
  the points projected half as much as the semidiameter of the
  shell giving it a radiating appearance The orifice is oval and
  rather small but of variable size The shell is thick and near
  the outer lamina is penetrated by pores the internal surface is
  smooth The sheath fig  b extends down but a short distance
  from the orifice it is closely attached to the walls the lines of
  growth at a point on each side bend a little downwards instead of
  upwards as in the two following species and hence the lower edge
  of the sheath irregularly projects downwards on each side The basal
  cup internally is plicated the hollows corresponding with the
  projecting longitudinal parietal septa which form the lobed border
  of the shell The largest specimen which I have seen was rather
  above  of an inch in diameter

  The Scuta and Terga are not calcified together they are both
  much elongated Scutum fig  c  eFor the first time in
  the genus or indeed in the family this valve presents a remarkable
  character in the adductor ridge being immensely developed so as to
  project far below the ordinary basal margin At the rostral end it
  at first appears to project even more than it really does for the
  toothed occludent margin is in fact a prolongation of the true valve
  as distinct from the adductor plate Excluding this very narrow
  prolonged occludent margin the adductor plate projects for a
  length equalling the rest of the valve Along the tergal margin the
  adductor plate is united to the articular ridge and at the rostral
  end it is produced into a square tooth whence a squareedged ridge
  extends on the surface of the plate upwards to the ordinary basal
  margin of the valve The exact shape of this adductor plate varies
  a little as does the degree to which it is closely attached to the
  ordinary basal edge of the valve The valve as distinct from the
  adductor plate is narrow with the basal margin regularly curved
  The articular ridge is very prominent

  Terga extremely narrow linear consisting in chief part of the
  spur which is fully four fifths of the entire length Externally
  fig  d the valve is furrowed with the edges more or less
  folded in along the spur The upper or ordinary part of the valve is
  about one third wider than the spur The basicarinal angle is sharp
  owing to the basal margin being a little hollowed out A special
  plate of shell fig  f hollow under its basal edge runs from
  the carinal margin to the articular ridge which latter is situated
  in the middle of the valve and against which the articular ridge of
  the scutum abuts The spur is central its end is bluntly pointed
  The total length of the tergum rather exceeds that of the scutum the
  produced adductor ridge being included in the latter

  AffinitiesUnder P grande I shall make a few remarks showing
  that in several characters P cancellatum and grande are at
  opposite ends of a short series with P conjugatum intermediate
  between them

     Dr Gray thinks this is the Pyrgoma stellata of Chenu
    Illust Conch it may be so but the figure given of the
    shell will do equally well or rather better for the Pyrgomum
    dentatum of this work and for some varieties of P crenatum
    Without a careful description of the opercular valves it is really
    impossible to recognise with any approach to certainty the
    species of this genus

Shell nearly flat with approximate radiating ridges scutum and tergum
calcified together without any suture scutum with the adductor ridge
descending below the basal margin and produced at the rostral end
into a point tergum with the spur about as large as the upper part of
valve

  HabRed Sea Brit Mus and Cuming


  Appearance and Structure of ShellShell white or with a tinge of
  purple nearly flat with moderately prominent narrow approximate
  ridges radiating from the orifice which is oval rather narrow
  and not very small In the largest specimens the ridges are less
  prominent than in the figure given The walls are thick and not at
  all porose the sheath extends down almost to the base of the shell
  and its lower edge is closely attached to the walls on each side
  towards the carina there is a trace of a suture and the lines of
  growth on the sheath are here a little upturned The basis is deeply
  imbedded and internally furrowed the calcareous layer forming it is
  thin The largest specimen was  of an inch in the longer diameter

  The Scuta and Terga fig  b  c in all the specimens
  which I have seen are calcified together with no trace of a
  suture There is however a slight furrow which I believe marks
  the normal line of separation between the two valves and in the
  following description this is assumed to be the case The Scutum
  has the adductor ridge greatly developed so as to project below
  the ordinary basal margin to a distance as great as the height of
  the valve At the rostral end this adductor ridge or plate is
  produced into a point and at the tergal end it is blended with the
  articular ridge and united to the inner face of the tergum That
  portion of the scutum which corresponds with the valve in ordinary
  cases and alone is externally visible as long as the operculum is
  united by the opercular membrane to the sheath is narrow with the
  basal margin considerably hollowed out the occludent edge is formed
  into thick teeth The Tergum is elongated rather exceeding in
  length the scutum the latter being measured from the apex to the
  rostral projection of the adductor plate The surface of the valve is
  depressed in the line of the spur with the basal end of the latter
  bluntly pointed A very slight flexure fig  c on the basal
  margin indicates where we may believe the spur to commence showing
  that it rather exceeds in length the whole upper part of the valve
  The lines of growth obscurely indicate a tendency to the formation of
  a slight occludent ledge along the carinal margin Traces are just
  visible of crests for the attachment of the tergal depressor muscles

  Appearance and Structure of Shell and BasisThe shell is conical
  though to a variable degree and sometimes is much depressed The
  surface is smooth with only traces of narrow approximate ridges
  The colour is white often with a tinge of dark purple The orifice
  is oval and moderately large The shell and a small portion of
  the basis usually stand exserted above the coral The walls are
  of variable thickness when thick the pores by which they are
  permeated are but little apparent sometimes there is more than a
  single row of pores The points of the septa on the basal edge of the
  shell are small The internal surface of the shell is smooth The
  sheath is closely attached to the walls and descends nearly to the
  basis on each side its lines of growth are slightly upturned The
  basis is deeply cupformed or cylindrical and in section oval like
  the shell it penetrates the coral to a very remarkable depthin
  one instance to three inches The shelly layer forming it is thin
  finely furrowed and not permeated by pores This is the largest
  species in the genus one specimen was three quarters of an inch in
  its longer diameter and above three inches in length

  The Scuta and Terga are calcified together without any trace
  of a suture the line of junction can be inferred only from the
  analogy of P conjugatum in which species the valves have a more
  normal character and are separated by a slight furrow It may be
  seen in the figure Pl  fig  d of the right and left hand
  opercular valves viewed from vertically above in their proper
  relative positions how abnormal their appearance is which is partly
  caused by the spinose occludent ledges presently to be described
  but chiefly from the carinal margins of the two terga not being
  straight and parallel as in all other cirripedes and therefore not
  meeting each other as is usual In other genera only the upper
  part of the carinal margin of the two terga can be opened for the
  exsertion of the cirri the lower portion being united by membrane
  but here I have little doubt from the position of attachment of
  the adductor muscle fig  c so close to and almost on the
  terga that the whole length of the carinal margin of the two terga
  is free or disunited for the protrusion of the cirri This opening
  between the two terga evidently cannot be closed but is probably
  filled up and the animal thus protected by the dorsal surfaces of
  the curledup cirri such I believe being likewise the case with
  some pedunculated cirripedes as with Conchoderma The scutum has
  a large adductor plate which extends some little way namely about
  one quarter of the height of the valve below the ordinary basal
  margin This latter margin is slightly sinuous and a little hollowed
  out towards the tergal corner of the valve I believe that the ridge
  which runs down to the basiscutal corner of the tergum though
  appearing to be part of the scutum really belongs to the tergum
  The adductor scutorum plate is not as in the last two species
  produced into a point at the rostral angle at the tergal end it
  blends into the under surface of the tergum The occludent margin
  is coarsely toothed Rather on the under side of this margin and in
  the upper part there is a narrow occludent ledge which extends up
  beyond the apex of the valve and thence runs a little way along the
  carinal margin of the tergum This ledge is thickly clothed with
  strong yellowishbrown spines and hence appears like a brush It
  is remarkable that the cavity for the adductor scutorum muscle is
  situated almost on the tergum

  The tergum is of large size and nearly square it is in
  appearance separated from the scutum by a ridge running up to the
  apex The basal margin forms a right angle with the carinal margin
  along which latter margin the lines of growth are upturned and blend
  into the occludent ledge which is common to the two valves There
  cannot be said to exist any spur the whole basal margin being almost
  straight nevertheless on close examination the ridge which in
  appearance separate the scutum and tergum may I think be safely
  considered as one side of the spur which it should be remembered
  has in all ordinary cases a longitudinal furrow or depression and
  the other side of the spur is apparently very feebly indicated by a
  slight flexure in the middle of the basal margin Hence if the spur
  had been developed it would probably have been half as wide as the
  valve There are no crests for the tergal depressor muscles

  AffinitiesThe present species with the last two form an
  interesting series Pyrgoma grande and conjugatum however
  are more closely allied to each other than to P cancellatum In
  the scutum the whole valve is least elongated with the adductor
  plate least developed in P grande and most elongated with
  the adductor plate most developed in P cancellatum In the
  outline of the tergum the range of shape is quite remarkable in P
  conjugatum which stands between the other two species the spur is
  rather long whereas in P grande there is no spur at alla very
  unusual circumstanceand in P cancellatum at the other end of
  this short series the spur attains a length wholly unparalleled in
  any other cirripede




 PYRGOMA MILLEPOR Pl  fig  a f

     From external aspect I suspect this species to be the
    Creusia madreporarum Leach  as given in Chenu Illust
    Conch Tab  fig  But I feel sure that Leach has nowhere
    published this name and it may be observed that Chenu gives it
    with a mark of doubt The shell in its imbedded state is only
    figured the opercular valves are not given and no descriptive
    details are added Under these circumstances I have not adopted
    this name I have perhaps been in some degree influenced by the
    fact that this species judging from the many specimens examined by
    me is never imbedded in madrepores but exclusively in millepores
    so that Chenu or Leachs specific name of Madreporarum is
    singularly inappropriate

  Appearance and Structure of ShellShell oval flat coloured pale
  dull purple or white with slight and narrow ridges radiating from
  the orifice which is not quite central but is placed rather nearer
  to the carinal than to the rostral end of the shell The orifice is
  small and narrow the carinal end being rounded and the rostral end
  narrower and sharperthis being the exact reverse of the usual
  shape of the orifice in the Balanid The walls are thick and are
  formed of large square tubes The internal surface of the shell is
  smooth The sheath fig  b is much more elongated than the
  shell for at the rostral end it extends to the basal margin and at
  the carinal end nearly to it whereas on the two sides it is some way
  distant from the base The orifice is considerably out of the centre
  of the sheath being placed nearest to the carinal end The sheath
  has its lower edge slightly prominent or free the lines of growth
  are neither turned up nor down on the two sides as in the last three
  species When nearly full grown the sheath is coloured dark purple
  but when young it is white hence the upper part is white surrounded
  by an oblong purple ring and this is surrounded by the white shell
  The basal cup is deep and internally nearly smooth The largest
  specimens were  of an inch in their longer diameter Great masses
  of the Millepora are absolutely studded with this Pyrgoma with
  usually more specimens on one side of the plate or branch than on the
  other They stand in approximately parallel positions the broad or
  carinal ends of the orifices pointing upwards

  ScutaThe scuta and terga are closely united and are often
  perhaps always in some slight though variable degree calcified
  together and hence they often break rather than separate at the
  line of articulation The external fissure or line of junction
  between them fig  c is oblique to the longer axis of the
  scutum in the uppermost part of the valve it is sometimes almost
  obliterated The two valves together are nearly as long as the
  sheath and consequently much longer than the orifice of the shell
  The scutum is much elongated being fully four times as broad as
  high The valve narrows towards the rostral end but in a variable
  degree the basal margin is hollowed out a little but to a variable
  amount close to the basitergal corner Along the occludent margin
  a slip of the valve widening downwards is a little bent inwards
  and this inflected portion is separated from the rest of the surface
  by a slightly angular ridge running from the apex to near the
  rostral angle Internally at the basitergal corner a slight ridge
  parallel and close to the basal margin and which can be seen only
  when the basal edge of the valve is held upwards represents the
  adductor ridge which we have seen so largely developed in the last
  three species and shall again see in P crenatum The articular
  ridge fig  d is extremely prominent consisting of a more or
  less rectangular shoulder

  Terga these are rather small compared to the scuta they are
  triangular and much arched there is no trace of a spur Internally
  fig  f the articular ridge is central there are some vestiges
  of crests for the depressor muscle

  AffinitiesThis wellmarked species in the tendency of the
  opercular valves to be soldered together and in the remarkable
  absence of a trace of a spur to the tergum is allied to P grande
  but it is more closely allied to the three following species

     Mr Dana informs me that he believes that this coral comes
    from the West Indies though the specimens originally described
    by him had no label If this be so both Pyrgoma dentatum and
    crenatum have very wide ranges


  Appearance and Structure of ShellShell nearly flat oval
  white or pink with rather distant prominent ridges radiating from
  the moderately large for the genus oval orifice The ridges are
  often obscured and apparently sometimes almost obliterated by the
  encrusting coral Shell permeated near the outer lamina by short
  imperfect pores internal surface smooth sheath inconspicuous
  descending rather more than half way down the walls lower edge
  closely attached to the walls Basis deep Diameter of largest
  specimen  of an inch

  Scuta these are elongated but to a very variable degree some
  specimens being quite three times and some barely twice as broad
  as high I observed this same variability in two sets of specimens
  differing as we shall presently see in the form of their terga
  it depends in part but not wholly on the varying width of the
  occludent ledge which is sometimes only a fourth and sometimes
  half as high as the rest of the valve This is the first species
  in the genus in which the occludent ledgea structure peculiar
  to the genushas been amply developed The basal margin of the
  valve is slightly sinuous and a very little hollowed out near the
  basitergal corner it is also very slightly reflexed the reflexed
  portion being separated from the upper part of the valve by a very
  slight depression or even furrow I notice this slightly reflexed
  portion simply as indicating a well marked feature in the basal
  margin of the following closely allied species Internally  g
  the adductor ridge is thick and slightly prominent but does not
  descend beneath the basal margin it blends into the articular ridge
  which here projects in a remarkable manner and degree  b  e
   g like a rounded tooth This tooth is in part a development of
  the occludent ledge it varies much in shape The line of junction
  between the scutum and tergum is nearly straight and nearly at right
  angles to their longer axes In some specimens the scuta and terga
  are partially calcified together

  Terga in three sets of specimens the terga differed considerably
  but as in every other respect there was the closest resemblance
  I do not doubt that these are merely varieties In all three the
  valve is rather small irregularly subtriangular in shape and
  externally somewhat convex in all three there is an occludent
  ledge of variable width as in the scuta and in all three there is
  an internal toothlike projection of variable form unlike anything
  I have seen in any other cirripede In the first variety Pl 
  fig  c  g the basicarinal corner of the valve is bluntly
  pointed and a slight flexure separates this portion of the valve
  from the other and scutal half which latter thus exhibits some
  tendency to be converted into a spur on the internal surface 
  g of this spurlike portion of the valve there is a rather long
  sharp tooth which projects rectangularly inwards it is flattened
  in a plane at right angles to the longer axis of the scutum and
  tergum together it cannot be seen from the outside In the second
  variety the shape of the valve is not very different Pl  fig
  d excepting that the flexure separating the basicarinal corner
  of the valve from the spur is deeper but on the internal face of
  the spur the tooth is far broader than in the first variety and
  is flattened quite differently viz in a plane nearly parallel to
  the surface of the valve and instead of projecting rectangularly
  inwards it depends beneath the basal edge of the socalled spur and
  can be seen from the outside In the third variety fig  f
  the whole carinal end of the valve is cut off and there can hardly
  be said to be any trace of a spur yet a slight furrow apparently
  marks the line of separation between the basicarinal portion of
  the valve here become very narrow and the broad irregular part
  which would have formed the spur had such been developed on the
  internal surface of the latter portion of the valve there is a very
  small blunt slightly flattened tooth projecting inwards and more
  resembling that in the first than that in the second variety

  Affinities under P crenatum I will point out the diagnosis and
  relationship between this and that species

  Appearance and Structure of ShellShell not distinguishable
  from that of P dentatum nearly flat oval white sometimes
  pale pink with rather distant prominent ridges radiating from the
  moderately large oval orifice Shell solid or permeated near the
  outer lamina by short imperfect pores internal surface smooth The
  sheath descends nearly to the base of the walls it is but little
  conspicuous and its lower edge is closely attached to the inner
  surface of the shell Basis deep Diameter of largest specimen under
   of an inch

  Scuta in this species the scutum is more abnormal than in any
  other Cirripede in the whole family this is owing both to the
  adductor ridge descending far beneath the basal margin and to the
  great development of the occludent ledge hence the middle and very
  narrow portion of the valve alone answers to the scutum as seen in
  other genera The whole valve including the adductor ridge and the
  occludent ledge is narrow being more than twice as broad as high
  but the proportional width varies owing chiefly as in the last
  species to the varying width of the occludent ledge This ledge
  commences a little way from the rostral point of the valve and
  gradually widening extends to the apex where it is either as high
  or twice as high as the rest of the valve It is articulated by a
  convex surface and by a hollow on its under side with the occludent
  ledge of tergum The scutum cannot be said to have any tergal margin
  without indeed the articular surface of the occludent ledge be
  thus called The basal margin is curved and considerably reflexed
  of which peculiarity we have seen a vestige in the last species
  the reflexion is not well shown owing to the foreshortening of the
  reflexed edge in fig  a this reflexed edge not being shown
  causes the lines of growth to appear as if they ran more transversely
  to the longer axis of the valve than they really do for they run
  nearly as in the scutum fig  e of P dentatum The direction
  of these lines of growth is of importance for they show that the
  elongation of the scuta is due to an inordinate increase in their
  breadth as compared to the same valves in ordinary species The
  adductor ridge having a sinuous margin runs from near the apex to
  near the rostral angle it descends below the basal margin about as
  far as the height of the true valve excluding the occludent ledge
  Of course this adductor ridge or plate lies beneath the membrane
  connecting the opercular valves with the sheath and is concealed by
  it as long as these valves remain within the shell The edge of the
  occludent ledge is straight but the edge of the middle portion of
  the valve that is of the true valve is much bowed

  Terga fig  b these are of so irregular a shape that they
  can hardly be described they may however be said to consist of
  two portions joined together of which the lower portion is a little
  elongated transversely of somewhat variable shape with part of its
  surface considerably depressed compared with the rest of the valve
  sometimes being even concave this concave portion apparently answers
  to the spur in other cirripedes At the scutal corner of the valve
  there is a shoulder perhaps answering to the inflected scutal margin
  in an ordinary tergum which locks into a hollow on the under side
  of the occludent ledge of the scutum The internal surface of the
  socalled spur is rounded and convex The upper part of the tergum
  is in main part formed by a great occludent ledge but this on its
  lower side is bordered by a narrow irregular slip which as shown
  by the lines of growth represents the whole of the ordinary valve
  excepting of course the spur already described The occludent
  ledges of both valves support some fine spines

  AffinitiesObserving how extraordinarily the terga varied in P
  dentatum and that the shells were identical in that and the present
  species it occurred to me at first that they might perhaps be both
  extreme varieties of one form but in the scutum of P crenatum
  the invariably great development of the adductor platethe marked
  manner in which its basal margin is reflexedthe absence of a
  toothlike articular projectionand again in the tergum of P
  crenatum the invariably large size of the concave spur without
  any internal tooth altogether convince me that the two species must
  be considered as distinct This species is allied to P grande in
  the scutum of that species having an occludent ledge though small
  and a great adductor plate I have only further to remark that the
  figure of the opercular valves given in Sowerbys Genera of Recent
  and Fossil Shells is so good that there can not be the least doubt
  about the present identification




 PYRGOMA MONTICULARI Pl  fig  a f

        Miscellany p  

Shell of an irregular shape with a roughened exterior border orifice
minute circular scutum and tergum both much elongated calcified
together without any suture both furnished with a broad occludent
ledge

  HabSingapore Mus Brit Cuming and Stutchbury Sometimes
  associated with Creusia spinulosa


  Appearance and Structure of ShellShell dull white very
  irregular in outline sometimes rounded more often unequally
  elongated and frequently starshapedthe projections being
  quite irregular Whole shell nearly flat but with the central
  part saddlebacked or formed into a more or less prominent ridge
  extending in the line of the longitudinal axis of the animals
  body the circumferential portions of the shell not unfrequently
  are a little recurved upwards Orifice extremely minute circular
  The outer lamina of shell which is smooth does not extend to the
  circumference and consequently a rather broad nearly equal border
  which is rough surrounds the whole shell I have no doubt that
  when the shell was alive this border was covered by a membrane
  which in drying has curled up and been lost in the same manner
  as the strictly analogous but narrow open seam between the basal
  edges of the shell and the basis in some cirripedes as in the last
  two species of Pyrgoma is protected The roughened border can
  sometimes be plainly seen to be formed of normal Pl  fig 
  e longitudinal septa having crenated edges with shorter septa
  between the longer ones but more often the septa are so irregular
  and so much branched  d that the whole resembles a mass of
  moss Why the outer lamina of the shell in this one species does not
  nearly reach the circumference of the walls I cannot conjecture The
  extremely irregular depressed shape of the shell with the minute
  circular orifice and the singular rough circumferential and often
  slightly reflexed border together give to this species so peculiar
  an aspect that until close examination I did not believe that it
  was a cirripede The extreme irregularity of shape depends in great
  part upon the irregular growth of the Monticularia in which it is
  imbedded

  Internally fig  b the walls are smooth but they are perforated
  by many quite irregular small orifices which have the appearance
  of having been formed by some boring animal but really serve as
  I believe to admit threads of corium into certain irregular pores
  which penetrate the shell The sheath descends but a very short
  distance from the orifice it is closely attached to the walls
  and might easily be overlooked The basis is deep of an irregular
  outline like that of the shell and is formed by a very thin shelly
  layer The largest specimen which I have seen measuring from the
  extreme projecting points was  of an inch in diameter

  The Scuta and Terga fig  f are calcified together without
  any trace of a suture together they form a bow with the two ends
  curled rather abruptly inwards they are both extremely narrow but
  furnished with an occludent ledge twice or thrice as high as the
  proper valves themselves This occludent ledge which is finely
  hirsute begins at about one third of the length of the scutum
  from the rostral angle and runs to near the basicarinal angle of
  the tergum The scutum itself is curved with a slip along the
  true occludent margin best seen at the rostral end lying in a
  different plane from the rest of the valve much in the same way as
  in the scutum of P millepor The adductor ridge descends a very
  little below the basal margin of the valve and extends for nearly
  its entire length this adductor ridge makes the proper valve even
  narrower than it at first appears The Tergum is extremely narrow
  forming merely a border to the occludent ledge but it is not short
  being about two thirds of the length of the scutum There is no trace
  of a spur indeed the valve is rather narrower where the spur should
  have stood than it is at the basicarinal end The scuta and terga
  are calcified together by their apices

  AffinitiesAlthough this species as above stated differs so
  remarkably in external appearance from the other species of the
  genus and indeed of the whole family yet the shell in no one
  essential point of structure materially differs from its congeners
  and if we compare the opercular valves with those of the three
  last species we shall be struck with their close yet graduated
  affinity in P millepor the scuta and terga tend to become
  calcified together and the rostrooccludent end of the scutum is
  bent into a different plane from the rest of the valve In P
  dentatum we have an occludent ledge exactly as in the present
  species but in that species the adductor plate is less developed
  than in P monticulari on the other hand in P crenatum the
  adductor plate is more developed than in P monticulari If in
  P crenatum we were to remove the spur from the tergum and it is
  much less developed in P dentatum and in P millepor it is
  entirely absent this valve would be almost identical with that of
  P monticulari Under these circumstances I consider it impossible
  to separate the present species as a distinct genus




Species Dubi


The Daracia Linni of J E Gray Annals of Philosophy new series
vol   was published without description or figure

The Megatrema semicostata of G B Sowerby junr Conch Manual
fig   is not described and is very indifferently figured
without the opercular valves and therefore can never be recognised

There is an admirable figure of a Pyrgoma without any specific name
in the great Description dEgypte but from the want of some details
I cannot positively recognise the species I am inclined to believe
that it is the P dentatum of this work

M Chenu in his grand Illustrations Conchyliologiques has given most
beautiful figures of several species of Pyrgoma and of Creusia but
unfortunately from the opercular valves not having been figured I
find it impossible to recognise them The new species are Pyrgoma
stellata on which I have appended a note under P conjugatum and
P spongiarum and P corymbosa of Valenciennes




 SubGenusCREUSIA Pl  

  CREUSIA Leach Journal de Physique tom  July 

Compartments four furnished with radii basis cupformed attached to
corals

  Distribution imbedded in corals throughout the tropical seas


Creusia is closely allied to Pyrgoma and had not this genus already
been adopted by several authors I should not I think myself have
formed it though no doubt it harmonises well with some of the other
genera of the family which are perhaps all too intimately related
Creusia differs from Pyrgoma only in the shell being separated by
sutures into four compartments with well developed radii in other
respects such as in general habit in the cupformed imbedded basis
not permeated by pores in the opercular valves in the characters
derived from the mouth and cirri there are no generic differences
This affinity is more particularly evident when Creusia is compared
with the first few species of Pyrgoma indeed for a short time I was
inclined to consider var  of Creusia as identical with Pyrgoma
conjugatum With respect to the species of Creusia I confess I have
been much perplexed in determining whether there be only one or half
a dozen The latter conclusion would almost certainly be arrived at if
only a few specimens were examined and it might naturally be thought
that some of the species were extremely well marked the difficulty
of drawing any line between varieties and species begins only when
some hundreds of specimens from various parts of the world are
disarticulated cleaned and carefully examined Creusia in this
respect offers a striking contrast with Pyrgoma in which nearly all
the species are strongly characterised The shell differs very little
in the several varieties or species of Creusia and the most marked
difference namely whether the walls are permeated by irregular
pores or not seems certainly quite variable It is in the opercular
valves which in other genera offer by far the most reliable character
that we encounter the chief cause of perplexity for the characters
thus derived though at first appearing very distinct blend into
each other and are not accompanied by any well marked differences
in the shell Only a few of my specimens have any habitat but the
geographical range as far as it does go throws no light on the
question which forms to regard as species and which as varieties As is
generally the case with cirripedes the variations are local so that
the greater number of specimens imbedded in the same coral resemble
each other Under these circumstances I have thought it best after
repeated examinations of a very large suite of specimens to describe
separately each variety without attaching any name to it but I will
first make a few general remarks on the structure of the shell If
I do not thus throw much light on the subject I shall at least not
burden it with error I believe that the species will be definitely
made out only by persons resident in the coralbearing zones I have
given copious illustrations of the opercular valves for if my view be
correct this genus offers a curious and striking case of variation
if on the other hand I am wrong the drawings I hope will aid
others in coming to a more correct conclusion

  General AppearanceThe shell is oval generally flat sometimes
  conical with narrow and approximate ridges radiating from the
  orifice fig  a The ridges however are sometimes distant from
  each other and considerably prominent projecting round the basal
  border The orifice is either neatly diamondshaped or oval The four
  compartments are quite distinct the radii are generally white of
  considerable width and with their summits not oblique The colour
  is either white or pale pinkishpurple but in var  bright
  pink Even in the white specimens when well preserved the sheath is
  generally but not always either pale or dark purple The largest
  specimen which I have seen from the West Indies was above half an
  inch in diameter but from  to  of an inch is the more usual full
  size I believe that the size as well as the great variability of
  the present species is partly determined by the rate of growth of
  the various zoophytes in which the specimens are imbedded for the
  shell has to keep on nearly a level with the surface of the coral

  Structure of Shell and BasisThe walls are internally ribbed
  the ribs being usually prominent sometimes to such a degree as
  to deserve to be called plates The outer lamina is of variable
  thickness and the prominence of the internal ribs appears in
  considerable part to depend on the extent to which the outer lamina
  has been thickened from within In many specimens instead of the
  interspaces between these internal ribs or longitudinal septa
  being solidly filled up separate and successive lamin have been
  deposited by which the shell is rendered cancellated or porose but
  the pores are very irregular and sometimes they form two or three
  irregular rows one behind the other this structure seems eminently
  variable The edges of the radii are formed by crenated and
  occasionally branched septa That part of the al which is added
  during the diametric growth of the shell is very thin The lower
  edge of the sheath seems always to be free The shelly layer forming
  the basis which is deeply cupformed is thin more or less finely
  furrowed in radiating lines and not permeated by pores

  The opercular valves will be best described under the following
  eleven varieties

  Var  Pl  fig  a  b  c  dHab Java
  and probably several other districtsI will first describe a
  typical subvariety by which I mean a subvariety not presenting
  any extreme character The scutum is of a subtriangular shape with
  the basitergal corner much rounded off  d and generally but
  not always hollowed out in a rather remarkable manner The adductor
  ridge is considerably prominent and extends high up parallel to
  the articular ridge which latter is rounded and prominent but
  to a variable degree Near the rostral angle there is sometimes a
  small tooth or only a trace of one depending beneath the basal
  margin this tooth we shall hereafter see much more developed The
  Tergum is about two thirds of the width of the scutum It is
  often slightly beaked but this is more conspicuous in some of the
  following varieties The spur is about half the width of the valve
  and its basal end is truncated and nearly parallel to the basal
  margin of the valve but the truncated form passes insensibly into
  a rounded outline The shell in this variety is generally thick and
  is not permeated by pores the orifice is diamondshaped But in
  another subvariety the walls of the shell are always or nearly
  always permeated by pores and the tergum is very much narrower
  with the spur sharper so that at first I concluded that these two
  subvarieties were specifically distinct we shall however soon
  see in var  and in var  that no confidence whatever can be
  placed in the exact breadth of the tergum or in the porosity of the
  walls hence I have been driven to consider the two varieties just
  mentioned as merely subvarieties

  Var  fig  e  f  gHab China Red SeaThe
  shell is almost invariably permeated by pores sometimes arranged
  in two or three very irregular rows In some specimens the scutum
  exactly resembles that in var  but with the tooth near the
  rostral angle often rather larger in other specimens the scutum is
  much more elongated transversely fig  e with the adductor
  ridge more medial and the basal margin not at all hollowed out
  at the basitergal corner of the valve The tergum here is the
  remarkable feature being sometimes excessively narrow with a long
  sharp spur which often but not always terminates in a needlelike
  point In other specimens from the same coral and certainly
  belonging to this same variety the valve is not so narrow  g
  and the spur not so pointed consequently as in several analogous
  cases in other cirripedes it is impossible to draw any line of
  distinction between the specimens with the narrow and broad terga

  Var  fig  h Creusia gregaria of G B SowerbyHab
  UnknownThe scutum presents here exactly the same considerable
  range of variation as in var  The tergum is broad as in var
   but the spur is rounded and from not being placed so immediately
  close to the basiscutal angle of the valve gives to it a rather
  different aspect The breadth of the spur varies an extreme variety
  is given in fig  h

  Var  Pl  fig  i  k  lHab Philippine
  Archipelago West IndiesThe scutum here presents the same
  subvarieties as heretofore excepting that I have not seen any so
  much elongated transversely The shell is covered either with slight
  closely approximate ribs as in the foregoing varieties or with more
  distant and more prominent ribs In specimens taken out of the same
  branch of coral the walls were either porose or solid Sometimes the
  sheath is bright purplishpink It is the tergum again which
  presents a remarkable range of difference for the longitudinal
  depression or furrow which in the former varieties was quite open
  here has its edges more or less folded inwards and is sometimes
  quite closed This same variation has been commonly observed in many
  species of Balanus in which it appears to be dependent on the age
  of the individual but this does not appear to be the case in the
  present genus As a consequence of the greater or less folding in of
  the two sides of the furrow the spur is rendered more or less narrow
  and pointed and thus becomes removed to a greater or less distance
  from the basiscutal angle of the valve Further as a consequence of
  this folding in the internal surface of the valve along the line of
  the external furrow is raised into a longitudinal ridge The length
  of the spur varies considerably In some very young individuals the
  basal margin descends lower on the scutal than on the carinal side
  of the spur In one set of specimens fig  l a plate extended
  from the carinal margin to near the central longitudinal ridge
  just mentioned a similar structure was described under Pyrgoma
  cancellatum

  Var  Pl  fig  mHab UnknownWe have seen in
  vars  and  that the scutum varies considerably in shape here
  it is unusually narrow with the adductor ridge almost touching the
  articular ridge There is no little tooth near the rostral angle and
  the basiscutal corner is not hollowed out The tergum also varies
  in some individuals it is truncated and like that figured of var
   but rather more rounded in other specimens from the same branch
  of coral the basal margin so blends into the spur that the latter
  can hardly be discriminated fig  m in other respects the
  outline resembles pretty closely that of one of the subvars fig
   f of var  The shell is not porose it is thick with strong
  internal ribs and resembles that of var  but it is of a pale
  purplish colour

  Var  an spec fig  n qHab Philippine
  ArchipelagoThis is a very remarkable variety we have imbedded
  in the same coral and with shells absolutely identical specimens
  with the scutum having three distinct but graduated forms Firstly
  a scutum transversely elongated in all external respects like some
  of the varieties mentioned under vars  and  with no rostral
  tooth and not hollowed out at the basitergal corner but with the
  adductor ridge more prominent Secondly a scutum of the same general
  shape but with the adductor ridge so much developed fig  n as
  to descend slightly beneath the basal margin and to be seen when
  the valve is viewed externally there is a very slight tooth near
  the rostral angle as in some former subvarieties and which can
  be here rather more clearly seen than hitherto to be formed by the
  adductor ridge closely united to the external surface of the valve
  extending thus far and being here produced a little downwards
  Thirdly  p we have the adductor ridge immensely developed
  descending far below the basal margin of the ordinary valve and
  the basal margin at the basitergal corner is angularly and deeply
  hollowed out The appearance of the valve is widely different from
  that in the first subvariety yet it is impossible to separate the
  first and second subvarieties and it is almost equally certain that
  the third subvariety is only an exaggeration of the second The
  lower edge of the adductor ridge in the third subvariety varies
  a little in outline it is deeply sinuous and is produced at the
  rostral angle into a point of which we have heretofore seen only a
  feeble representation It would appear as if the great development of
  the adductor plate had caused the exterior ordinary surface of the
  valve to shrink or be less developed There is a striking resemblance
  in the structure here described with that in Pyrgoma cancellatum
  and conjugatum The terga belonging to the above scuta also
  vary the spur being sometimes square  o and sometimes bluntly
  pointed when the spur runs in the same exact line  q with the
  scutal margin of the valve a peculiar aspect is given to it but
  this is by no means always the case Both opercular valves are often
  partially coloured pinkishpurple The shell is not porose it is
  thin with remarkably prominent internal plates it is apparently
  always of small size which I attribute to this variety inhabiting
  a hard thin platelike coral The sheath is bright pinkishpurple
  of which we have had instances in some of the other varieties and
  the shell itself is sometimes pinkish Taking the scutum of the
  first subvariety together with the commonest accompanying variety
  of tergum I find it quite impossible to assign to it a specific
  character if on the other hand we consider the scutum of the
  third subvariety by itself nothing can appear more distinct but
  I must repeat there can be hardly a shadow of doubt that the three
  subvarieties of scutum here described graduate into each other and
  are specifically identical

  Var  fig  rHab Probably Philippine Archipelago
  associated with Balanus quadrivittatusThere can be hardly any
  question of this being specifically identical with the last variety
  It inhabits a different coral All the specimens were of small size
  The walls are not so thin and the internal ribs not so prominent as
  in var  The sheath is either white or dull purple I can in
  short point out no difference in the shell from the typical var
   The scutum is not so much elongated transversely as in var
   and the basitergal corner is more cut offin which respect
  it resembles the common varieties The adductor ridge is largely
  developed so as to be just visible when the valve is viewed from the
  outside in a degree between the first and second subvarieties of
  var  but the most singular character is the larger development
  of the tooth near the rostral angle and this was the case in the
  same degree in all the specimens which I examined The tergum
  resembles that rather unusual subvariety of var  fig  q
  which has the scutal margin and the one side of the spur forming a
  straight line It appears to me that it would be absurd to consider
  these slight differences in parts unquestionably subject to much
  variation as specific when we are almost forced to admit that the
  much greater differences in the three subvarieties of var  are
  not of specific value

  Var Hab Unknown Mus CumingI have seen only a single
  specimen of this and refer to it on account of var  The shell
  is rather steeply conical with distant and prominent ribs the radii
  are narrow the walls are not permeated by pores the colour is pale
  purple Altogether its external appearance is very different from
  that of the foregoing varieties but the scuta are identical with
  those of var  excepting that the rostral tooth is rather larger
  being nearly as large as in the last var  The tergum precisely
  resembles that in some specimens of var  Hence this variety
  differs from the first two varieties only in the shade of colour the
  external shape and the greater prominence of the external radiating
  ribs of its shell All these characters are variable in the several
  foregoing varieties and they have been found as yet insufficient
  to discriminate species in any genus of sessile Cirripedes


Varieties With the Scuta and Terga Calcified Together

  Var  Pl  fig  s C spinulosa of Leach Hab
  UnknownThe shell is undistinguishable by a single character from
  many specimens of the first third and fourth varieties it is not
  permeated by pores The scutum and tergum with the exception of the
  one striking difference of their being calcified together without
  any trace of a suture are identical with those of var  as may
  be seen by comparing the figures  h and  s Hence to separate
  this form specifically from var  we should have to rely solely
  on the calcification or union of the scuta and terga but we have
  seen this is a point which is variable in Elminius Kingii Pyrgoma
  millepor and in some species of Balanus The serial affinities
  moreover in Pyrgoma clearly show that this is a character of no
  great importance I must add that in several specimens of several of
  the varieties the scuta and terga were so closely joined that until
  careful examination I was unable to detect the suture separating
  them such being the case it must be quite unimportant for any
  functional purpose whether or not the valves are calcified together
  I feel consequently hardly any doubt that I have acted right in
  treating the present form as a mere variety

  Var  an spec fig  tHab UnknownThis variety
  bears nearly the same relation to var  as the last variety did
  to var  The shell is rather stronger than in var  with the
  internal ribs not so prominent and except in being tinted pale dull
  purple it differs in no respect from the shell of var  If we
  imagine the scutum and tergum in the third subvariety of var 
   p  q in which the adductor ridge descends far beneath the
  true basal margin of the valve to be calcified together without any
  suture we shall produce almost the identical valves of the present
  variety The scutum however here is not quite so much elongated
  transversely and the occludent margin is spinose and is furnished
  with large teeth these two characters give the valve a somewhat
  different aspect and hence I am more doubtful than in the foregoing
  case whether this form may not be specifically distinct I must
  however state that in Tetraclita porosa I ascertained that the
  teeth on the occludent margin of the scuta were even more variable
  than here is supposed to be the case and as for the shape of the
  valve we have seen what wonderful variation there is in var  The
  tergum in this variety is about intermediate between the two common
  forms in the subvarieties of var  As for the calcification of
  the two valves together we have seen under the last variety how
  little important a character it is

  Var  fig  U  u Creusia grandis of Chenu Tab 
  fig  but not fig  a and bHab Singapore associated
  with Pyrgoma monticulariThis variety is very closely related
  to the last The shell however has a very peculiar aspect which
  made me for some time think it must be specifically distinct It is
  of a much brighter pink than in any of the foregoing varieties the
  surface is marked with very prominent distant ribs and the radii
  are narrow in which latter points together with the tint though
  here brighter this variety cannot be distinguished from var 
  The shell however is permeated by several rows of pores in which
  respect it resembles the shell in var  and some specimens of
  vars  and  In the opercular valves there is a close general
  resemblance with those of the last var  the tooth however
  near the rostral angle is not so prominent and in the tergum the
  spur is more truncated shorter and broader than in var  and
  closely resembles that in var  and  But I cannot consider any
  of the points here specified of much weight


  The foregoing descriptions show how singularly the affinities of the
  several varieties interlock in the most complicated manner Hereafter
  some one may perhaps succeed in grouping several of these forms as
  species but I am sure he ought not to attempt it without possessing
  a very large suite of specimens or without the great advantage of
  comparing some two or three of the forms fresh in their native site


  Species dubiUnder Pyrgoma I have stated that though Chenu
  in his Illust Conch has given beautiful external figures of
  the shells imbedded in the coral yet from the want of details on
  the opercular valves and on the structure of the shell I cannot
  recognise his species So it likewise is with Creusia Chenu gives
  the following new species C radiata multistriata decorata
  and striata The C madreporarum I suspect to be the Pyrgoma
  millepor of this work as there stated The C grandis no doubt
  is the P grande of this work the Nobia grandis of Sowerby The
  name Creusia Childreni is given by Dr Gray without description or
  figure in the Annals of Philosophy vol  new series

  Distribution throughout the tropical and warmer temperate seas of
  the whole world attached to turtles crustacea or smooth gasteropod
  molluscs


This is a distinct and welldefined genus Several authors have
confounded it with Coronula but this has been owing to an entire
misapprehension of the structure of the shell in the two genera In
Coronula the parietes are very thin and are so deeply folded as to
appear like rays or septa connecting the outside of the shell the
expanded ends of the folds and the internal surface of the shell but
the open spaces between the folds are occupied by the epidermis of the
Whale and are external to the cirripede In Chelonobia the parietes
are remarkably thick hence the plates or septa connecting the outer
and inner lamina are of unusual length and the spaces between them
though of course internal with regard to the cirripede and occupied by
the ovaria have been compared to the spaces external to and between
the folded walls of Coronula There is but little special affinity
between these genera and I regret that they have come to be placed one
after the other in this work but the elongated opercular valvesthe
thick and double opercular membranethe weak depressor musclesand
the peculiar manner in which the scutum is articulated by the aid of
a horny projection to the tergum may indicate some real but slight
affinity to Coronula the many points of difference however in the
structure of the shell and of the opercular valves and especially in
the cementing apparatus of the basal membrane and in the branchi
all prove that the genera are very distinct The singular structure of
the rostrum which in fact consists of three compartments externally
blended together and which three correspond in all essential respects
to the rostrum and two rostrolateral compartments in the Chthamalin
offers a very striking point of identity with that subfamily but
neither in the mouth cirri or other part can I detect any other
evidence of this relationship Having so far discussed the affinities
of the genus I may add that the three species though decidedly
distinct are closely and nearly equally related to each other

General AppearanceThe shell is generally depressed and broadly
oval or almost circular in C testudinaria and caretta it
has a massive appearance the surface is generally smooth or
when disintegrated finely striated the colour is white The six
compartments do not differ much in size the rostrum is rather larger
than the carina and the lateral compartments than the carinolateral
compartments It is remarkable that in C caretta Pl  fig
 even in specimens which have not grown crowded together the
compartments are almost invariably placed rather unsymmetrically
the rostrum and carina not exactly facing each other The shell
though so thick and massive yields easily along the lines of suture
The radii are moderately wide or narrow or not at all developed
being represented by mere sutures in this latter case in C
caretta the orifice of the shell is enlarged in the same manner as
we have seen in some species of Balanus and Tetraclita by the gradual
wearing away of the upper part of the shell In C testudinaria
the radii have a singular notched structure fig  a and the
whole shell a starlike appearance The orifice is not filled up by
the elongated opercular valvesa considerable extent of opercular
membrane being visible on the two sides The largest specimen which
I have seen namely of C testudinaria was nearly two and a half
inches in its longer diameter

     In Mr Stutchburys collection there is a specimen of C
    testudinaria in which there are only five compartments one of the
    lateral compartments having been aborted of this I have seen no
    other instance in any genus

Structure of the ParietesThe parietes are of unequalled thickness
especially in the first two species of the genus From the outer lamina
see Pl  fig  and the section in Pl  fig  numerous
vertical plates extend inwards alternately to a less or greater
distance some of them reaching to the inner lamina these answer to
the longitudinal parietal septa in other genera and the elongated
cavities between them which occur in C testudinaria and patula
answer to the parietal tubes or pores The radiating plates or septa
have their sides finely channelled and their basal edges generally
slightly sinuous and always finely toothed The interspaces between
the plates in the uppermost part of the shell are filled up solidly
and in C caretta even down to near the basis in this latter
species the plates are irregular and much broken up so as in parts
to consist of little separate flattened points In C patula the
inner lamina of the parietes b in fig  Pl  can be best
made out to be distinct from the sheath e c e in fig  and c
in the section of C testudinaria fig  Pl  The sheath in
this genus descends in a very remarkable manner to the basal membrane
and has its basal edge toothed like the basal edges of the radiating
septa The inner lamina itself does not descend to the basal membrane
In C testudinaria the inner lamina is of great thickness but in
the section fig  owing to its having been taken high up the
inner lamina b is not distinct from the shelly matter deposited
between the septa In C caretta the line of separation between the
inner and outer lamin can in no part be distinguished owing to the
interspaces between the septa having been solidly filled up close down
to the basis

SheathThe layer of shell surrounding the internal cavity e c
e fig  Pl  and extending down to the basal membrane I have
called the sheath owing to its being distinctly continuous with the
innermost layer in the upper part of the shell to which the opercular
membrane is attached this can be best seen by examining the al in
the separated compartments of C patula The sheath is not only
remarkable from thus descending to the basal membrane but in C
testudinaria and patula from its lower edge being perforated by
arched channels under c in fig  allowing thick ribbons of
corium to reach the interspaces between the radiating septa There
is one central arch or channel in the middle of the lower part of
the sheath of each compartment and one on each line of suture the
sheath being a little hollowed out on both sides of the sutures As the
rostrum as far as its internal structure is concerned consists of
three compartments we have altogether in the shell eight compartments
and eight sutures and consequently altogether sixteen arches through
the lower part of the sheath allowing sixteen thick ribbons of corium
to penetrate the parietes and thus likewise reach the radii There is
however sometimes a little variation in the number of these arched
channels The upper part of the sheath is transversely marked by
zones of growth to the lower one of which the opercular membrane is
attached The line of attachment is not low down the sheath

Radii and AlThe radii when the compartments are disarticulated
present a remarkable structure from appearing to consist of a distinct
inner and outer portion The radius normally consists of an inner and
outer lamina united by septa parallel to the basis but here the inner
portion is formed by a central ridge a a fig  Pl  sending
off on both sides little septa often subbranched it is of nearly
uniform width and there is no distinct inner lamina The outer portion
b which often equals or exceeds in thickness the inner portion
is in fact the normal outer lamina developed to an unparalleled
degree In most Cirripedes the edge of the radius is received in a
slight furrow in the opposed compartment the lid of which furrow is
narrow and matches the outer lamina of the radius here the lid of the
recipient furrow is very broad and resembles the outer lamina of the
radius in all its characters In order to allow of growth between the
thick opposed edges of the outer lamina of the radius and the lid of
the recipient furrow the two surfaces are finely dentated look in
fig  under the pits marked b almost like the crown of a molar
tooth thus allowing films of corium to enter The structure here
described is common in a greater or less degree to all three species
but is best seen in C testudinaria In this species moreover fig
 b the outer lamina instead of being smooth and of either equal
or gradually increasing thickness from top to bottom is generally but
not always fig  a deeply pitted or notched in transverse lines
the outer lamina being thus rendered alternately thicker and thinner
and so formed into transverse ridges and valleys Hence the lines of
suture become toothed the points of the teeth facing each other and
not interlocking In the transverse section fig  Pl  of the
same species taken high up across the shell f is the pitted outer
lamina and e the inner portion of the radius Although the radii
are thus specially added to in thickness they are not so thick as the
very thick walls and hence the lines of suture form furrows more or
less deep The al are of moderate thickness and have their sutural
edges crenated by fine transverse septa

RostrumI have already alluded to the peculiar compounded structure
of this compartment unlike anything we have as yet seen The
thin outer lamina is quite continuous and shows no trace of the
triple nature of the compartment as may be seen by comparing the
drawing Pl  fig  a of the shell of C testudinaria
with the transverse section Pl  fig  of the same species
in this latter figure a is the outer lamina and B A B the three
compartments of the rostrum But when the outer lamina is worn away
as is always the case with the upper part of the walls in C caretta
Pl  fig  the two fissures separating the three compartments
of the compounded rostrum are plainly exhibited on the outside of
the upper part of the shell On the internal surface the sutures
separating the three compartments are always open except in the upper
part of the sheath above the attachment of the opercular membrane
where they are partially obliterated by a thin continuous layer of
shell That these three portions of the rostrum are in their essential
nature compartments is well shown in C patula and testudinaria
by the sheath or inner lamina having loopholes or channels such as
before described in the middle of each and on each line of suture
From the number of these channels seven altogether the two between
the compound rostrum and lateral compartments being counted the
sheath of the compound rostrum is reduced to mere flattened pillars
between the several channels By slight violence the rostrum breaks
into the three portions and the sutures between them are found to be
marked on both sides by sinuous slight calcareous ridges those on
opposite sides locking into each these represent the septa on the
edges of the radii and al and their recipient furrows in the ordinary
compartments The outline of the middle compartment of the three best
seen in section Pl  fig  A much resembles that of the carina
in fact if we suppose the growth of the two al of the carina to have
been arrested no essential difference can be pointed out in this
rudimentary compartment therefore we have a rostrum characterised as
in the subfamily of the Chthamalin In the two little rostrolateral
compartments moreover B B a slight swelling on the side opposite
to the large existing radius shows that if the development of these
compartments had not been prevented each probably would have
had exactly as in the Chthamalin a radius on both sides In the
introduction to the Balanid I have argued from the structure here
described and from some other facts that in the Balanin the rostrum
is composed of the three anterior compartments which we see in the
Chthamalin indissolubly united together hence in Chelonobia the
middle one of the three partiallyblended compartments is properly the
rostrum and those on the sides the rostrolateral compartments

     My attention was first called to this peculiar structure of
    the rostrum by Mr Stutchbury

BasisThe basal membrane extends under the thick walls to the
outside I was not able to make out the whole cementing apparatus
The main trunk is remarkable from its small diameter f f in fig
 Pl  and from the distance at which the cementglands stand
apart Each gland gives rise to a pair of cementducts which tend to
run in parallel groups these ducts repeatedly bifurcate occasionally
inosculate and decrease in diameter they debouch and allow the cement
to escape at numerous points placed at irregular distances on the
edges of each new slip of the basal membrane

Opercular ValvesThese are elongated they do not fill the orifice
of the shell they are attached by a strong opercular membrane a little
way down the sheath The opercular membrane is generally double for
the lastformed membrane is not immediately moulted as soon as a new
one is formed as generally happens in Balanus Externally the valves
are marked by rather rugged broad zones of growth The Scuta are
elongated in the line of the orifice of the sack the occludent margin
Pl  fig  b is much inflected and generally sinuous along
this inflected portion a distinct squareedged ridge runs which widens
from the apex downwards The depression for the adductor muscle is
very deep there are no pits or crests for the other muscles When the
scutum is thoroughly cleaned and all the membrane removed by caustic
potash the tergal margin is marked by a slight articular ridge and
furrow This articular ridge is very remarkable from supporting a
prominent flattened crest fig  b composed of hard yellow
horny membrane which overlaps the inner surface of the tergum
and exactly corresponds in shape and purpose with the calcareous
articular ridge when best developed in other genera Beneath the basal
and generally slightly sinuous exterior margin of the valve that is
the margin to which the opercular membrane is attached a slight
ledge depends fig  d which narrows off towards the rostral end
of the valve I should have thought that this had been a depending
adductor ridge as in several species of Pyrgoma had there not been
a nearly similar ledge beneath the middle part of the basal margin of
the tergum The Tergum is mitreformed with the summit more or less
truncated and with the carinal margin generally more sloping than the
scutal margin near the carinal margin there is a slight furrow fig 
d sometimes difficult to be distinguished with the lines of growth
curving down to it on each side and consequently with a very slight
but variable corresponding projection on the basal margin This furrow
and slight projection there can be hardly any doubt represent the
spur though here placed close to the carinal instead of to the scutal
margin as in other genera The tergum has a small articular ridge
against which the overlapping horny articular ridge of the scutum
abuts There are no crests for the tergal depressor muscles Altogether
the scuta and terga are very peculiar A portion dissolved in acid
exhibits no tubuli On the opercular membrane there are no hairs The
rostral depressor muscles of the scuta are singularly feeble each
consisting of only one or two or sometimes three or four very thin
ribbonlike fasci the lateral depressores of the scutum are twice as
strong as the rostral depressores and the tergal depressores a little
stronger than the lateral depressores All these muscles are plainly
marked with transverse stri

MouthThe labrum is not in the least bullate which character as
well as some others that follow I specify on account of the apparent
affinity of Chelonobia to the Chthamalin as indicated by its rostrum
The crest of the labrum is notched and on each side of the notch there
is a long row of teeth which however are sometimes worn away The
mandibles have five main teeth all excepting the first being laterally
double The maxill are not notched The outer maxill are bilobed on
their inner sides

CirriThe four posterior pairs in proportion to the size of the
animal are much elongated and are remarkable from the number of their
short segments The rami of the first cirrus are a little unequal in
length The second cirrus is moderately short with its segments
rather broad and protuberant and thickly clothed with spines The
third cirrus is of unusual length being but little shorter than the
fourth pair its segments however are broad and are thickly clothed
with spines as are the two segments of its pedicel hence there is no
real approach to that important character of the Chthamalin namely
the similarity of the third with the three posterior pairs of cirri
The numerous segments of the fourth fifth and sixth pairs of cirri
each support only two pairs of main spines between each of these pairs
there is a little tuft of fine intermediate spines the upper of the
two tufts on each segment is the longest In a specimen of C patula
in which there were fifteen segments in one ramus of the second cirrus
there were fifty segments in either ramus of the sixth cirrus At the
exterior bases of the pedicels of some of the anterior cirri there are
large tufts of finely plumose delicate hairs

BranchiThese are of large size they consist of a single fold
much plicated and subplicated

OvariaThe ovarian tubes run into the parietes and fill up the
interspaces between the radiating septa

Range cThe three species seem to range together over the
tropical and warmer temperate seas of the whole world C patula
and testudinaria are found in the Mediterranean and the former at
Charleston in the United States I have not heard of specimens from
any point further north C testudinaria and caretta live attached
to turtles whilst C patula always adheres to crustacea to large
and smooth gasteropod mollusca and I believe sometimes to ships
bottoms I have not heard of the discovery of any fossil species

AttachmentChelonobia patula leaves no impression on the crabs
and shells to which it is attached I have seen only a few specimens
of C testudinaria attached and the carapaces of the turtle were
not at all or scarcely at all indented by them The case is very
different with C caretta in which the shell even of young
specimens is always as far as I have seen imbedded to some depth
and occasionally to a very great depth in the tortoiseshell From
the extreme hardness of the tortoiseshell when dry the imbedment
appears more wonderful even than it really is The younger shells have
the appearance of having grown from within the carapace and then of
having burst through it almost like little volcanos I have seen
only one very young shell th of an inch in external diameter
attached and here there was nothing to countenance an idea which at
one time occurred to me namely that the larva perhaps fixed itself in
some little crack or cavity in the carapace and there underwent its
metamorphosis I believe that the imbedment is effected simply by the
sharp growing basal edges of the walls of the shell indenting the
surface and finally rupturing the outer lamin of the tortoiseshell
through that same force by which the tender radicle of a plant
penetrates very hard ground As soon as the surface was once ruptured
the shell of the Chelonobia growing outwards and downwards would
easily like a wedge turn up the lamin of the tortoiseshell and
their ragged ends would surround the Chelonobia as is seen actually to
be the case In the genus Coronula and its allies which are attached
to Cetaceans we shall presently see that the epidermis immediately
under the downward growing shell and apparently in consequence of the
pressure thus exerted is thinner than in the surrounding parts In
two specimens of Chelonobia caretta imbedded much more deeply than
usualin one of which half the basal edge of the shell had fairly cut
through the carapace and in the other was on the point of effecting
thisthe tortoiseshell manifestly thinned out towards the line of
yielding now this I suppose must be attributed either to absorption
or to the living tortoiseshell being actually stretched till rendered
transparent and ready to burst or until bursted On the latter view
of the tortoiseshell having been stretched we must further suppose
that the pressure has prevented fresh layers of tortoiseshell being
deposited under the old and yielding lamin In one of the above two
specimens the walls of the Chelonobia were deeply folded nevertheless
the lamin of the tortoiseshell followed every curvature showing
that though now so rigid during the slow imbedment of the Cirripede
it must have been sufficiently pliant A shell attached as these two
specimens were could never be removed and whether dead or alive
would remain for ever imbedded in the tortoiseshell Dr R Ball
of Dublin informs me that he has seen specimens in which the shell
of the cirripede not only had penetrated the carapace but likewise
the underlying bone and had even entered some way into the body of
the turtle it is well known that the tusk of a boar or the horn of a
ruminant when curving in abnormally will sometimes penetrate deeply
into the bones of the face or head and this I believe is effected
not by the fracture of the bone but by the absorption of the point
pressed on I conceive a similar process must have taken place in the
curious specimens examined by Dr Ball

It is impossible to feel sure which of the three species of the genus
Linnus had in view when describing his Lepas testudinaria but
as Spengler has well discriminated the following species under the
specific name of caretta and Ranzani the third species under
patula the present name may without question be retained for the
following species In several respects this species is intermediate
between C caretta and patula but it can most conveniently be
described first

     I am indebted to Dr J E Gray for having guided me to this
    identification

  General AppearanceShell strong globuloconical depressed
  outline broadly oval surface smooth generally well preserved but
  when disintegrated upper part finely striated colour dead white
  orifice oval elongated rather exceeding in length one third of the
  longer basal diameter of the shell The radii are rather narrow and
  deeply depressed they have their summits square their outer lamina
  as explained under the genus on both sides of each suture is in most
  specimens divided into teeth the points of which face and touch
  each other These teeth or notches give quite a peculiar appearance
  to the shell and alone suffice to discriminate this species they
  are sometimes blunt and partially obliterated but it is rare to
  find a specimen in which some few teeth do not occur in some one of
  the six radii I have however seen two or three specimens with all
  six radii perfectly smooth in one of these the general shape of the
  shell without the aid of any internal characters almost sufficed
  to show that it belonged to the present species but in another
  specimen which had unusually narrow radii and the whole surface of
  which had undergone considerable disintegration and was consequently
  striated could only be distinguished from C caretta by internal
  characters I have seen several specimens having very irregularly
  shaped compartments but generally the appearance of the whole shell
  is highly symmetrical like a star and the genus was appropriately
  named by old Klein Astrolepas In some specimens in Mr Cumings
  collection from the Low Archipelago in the Pacific taken off the
  toenail of a turtle the shape was almost cylindrical the shell
  almost resembling that of Coronula diadema The largest specimen
  which I have seen was  of an inch in basal diameter but only 
  in height

  Structure of Shell and RadiiAfter the full generic description
  the only point to which I need allude is that the radiating
  parietal septa as well as the descending sheath are much thicker
  than in C patula and that their basal edges can be plainly seen
  by the naked eye to be dentated with numerous points The thickness
  of these plates and of the sheath varies considerably In C
  caretta I may add the plates are broken up into many separate
  points and in this species the descending sheath is not generally
  perforated excepting at the sutures by loopholes for the entrance
  of ribbons of corium The sheath and inner lamina of the parietes
  in C testudinaria taken together fully equal one third of the
  entire thickness of the walls Flattened cavities or tubes run up
  between the parietal septa for about two thirds of the height of the
  inside of the shell With respect to the radii I have only to add
  that the thickness of the inner portion relatively to the generally
  notched outer lamina varies considerably

  Opercular Valves fig  b dThese closely resemble
  each other in all three species and have been almost sufficiently
  described under the genus The scutum has its occludent margin always
  sinuous but to a variable degree In one specimen there was a deep
  little pit at the rostral end for the rostral depressor muscle The
  terga vary considerably in shape according as the basicarinal
  corner is more or less truncated The external furrow marking the
  position of the rudimentary spur varies much in distinctness
  chiefly depending upon its nearness to the carinal margin of the
  valve

  Mouth and CirriThe labrum sometimes has its teeth worn away
  The second pair of cirri relatively to the others is shorter and
  thicker than in the two following species

  General AppearanceShell extremely strong massive heavy
  broadly oval globuloconvex though sometimes depressed dirty
  white surface in the upper part always worn and disintegrated
  hence finely striated in the lower part a little rugged slightly
  folded and occasionally in deeply imbedded specimens much folded
  or ribbed Orifice oval not at all angular rather exceeding in
  length one third of the basal diameter of the shell Radii either not
  at all developed or very narrow but even in the former case the six
  lines of suture are plain and in the latter case the radii lie at
  some depth beneath the surface of the shell It is remarkable that
  the compartments are hardly ever arranged symmetrically the rostrum
  and carina not facing each other exactly and this holds good in
  specimens attached separately without any apparent cause for this
  want of symmetry The largest specimen which I have seen was  in
  basal diameter and this which was a steeply conical individual
  was  in height and therefore nearly twice as high as an ordinary
  large specimen of C testudinaria

  Structure of Shell and RadiiThe descending sheath and radiating
  septa are of very variable thickness and have their basal edges
  finely dentated The septa are not continuous from the circumference
  to the sheath in unbroken plates but are irregularly divided into
  separate often short portions and even occasionally into mere
  points The sheath differs from that of the other two species in
  having loopholes for the entrance of ribbons of corium only on the
  eight lines of suture and not with rare exceptions in the middle
  of each compartment this is evidently due to fewer filaments of
  corium being here sufficient to supply the less deep interspaces
  between the radiating septa for in this species there are no
  flattened cavities or tubes running far up the shell The inner
  lamina of the walls cannot be here distinguished for a solid flat
  calcareous surface extends from the circumference between the
  radiating septa to the sheath The sheath had it not been from the
  light thrown on this part by the other species would have certainly
  been mistaken for the inner lamina of the walls The absence of the
  flattened cavities or tubes extending up the parietes seems to be
  the least varying character and serves to distinguish this species
  from those worn and massive specimens of C testudinaria which
  have narrow and notnotched radii

  In specimens in which the radii are not developed no vestige of the
  outer lamina can be detected the lateral faces of the adjoining
  compartments being closely pressed together but in specimens in
  which the radii have been developed and have grown the outer lamina
  of course is present and is extremely thick with the growing edge
  having a branched and mammilated surface as in C testudinaria
  but with the external surface not pitted or notched as in that
  species The inner portion of the radius whether or not developed
  has nearly the same appearance consisting of rather thick transverse
  septa branching from a central ridge which is sometimes obscure

  The Al are remarkably little prominent as least in those
  specimens in which the radii are not developed so that Spengler
  seems to have thought that the structure of the shell was essentially
  different from that of Balanus which certainly is by no means the
  case The edges of the al are very thick nearly as thick as the
  inner portion of the radius

  The Opercular Valves hardly present any essential difference
  compared with those of the other species but the occludent margin
  of the scutum is apt to be more sinuous and its rostral end blunter
  and squarer The carinal end of the tergum is also squarer than in
  any common variety of C testudinaria the external furrow or spur
  near the carinal margin is very indistinct and even sometimes is
  quite absent

  Neither the mouth nor cirri present any deviations from the generic
  character

  diameter of the shell The summits of the compartments are usually
  perfectly preserved pointed and often a little recurved The radii

  and arched they are seated only a little below the general level
  of the parietes I have seen one specimen rather more than one and
  a half inch in basal diameter but this is an unusual size this
  species not growing to so large a size as the two foregoing forms

  Structure of Shell and RadiiThe walls are here thinner than in
  the two foregoing species and the basal surface of a compartment
  rarely equals half the basal diameter of the internal cavity of the
  shell measured transversely to its longer axis The radiating septa
  are also much thinner generally sinuous and so finely dentated
  along their basal edges that the teeth can be clearly perceived
  only by the aid of a lens The interspaces between the septa run up
  to nearly the summits of the compartments and hence the lightness
  of the whole shell The inner lamina of the parietes is here not so
  thick fig  and is more distinct from the descending sheath than
  in the foregoing species The sheath is thin like the radiating
  septa the medial loophole in each compartment for the entrance of
  a filament of corium is much wider than in C testudinaria for
  it is generally as wide as the bordering plate on either hand and
  in not a few specimens the medial loophole is so wide as hardly
  any longer to deserve being so called for the descending sheath
  is reduced to mere flattened pillars or legs on the sides of the
  sutures Although the parietes are here not nearly so thick as in
  the two foregoing species yet as the radii stand but little beneath
  the level of the parietes the outer lamina of the radius has a
  considerable thickness and is sometimes separated from the inner
  portion of the radius by an interval in the same manner as in C
  testudinaria and the growing edges of the outer lamina exhibit
  traces of the same mamillated structure as figured in that species

  The Opercular Valves are apt to be rather narrower and more
  elongated than in the foregoing species with the occludent margin
  of the scutum generally but not always only slightly sinuous
  externally the scutum is sometimes feebly striated longitudinally In
  the tergum Pl  fig  b the longitudinal furrow is generally
  plainer from being more distant from the carinal margin and the
  rudimentary spur itself is more prominent

  The mandibles usually have five narrow teeth but I have seen
  one specimen having only four teeth and with the inferior angle
  truncated The cirri present no particular character

Compartments six of equal sizes walls thin deeply folded with
the folds forming cavities open only on the under side of the shell
opercular valves much smaller than the orifice of the shell

  Distribution mundane imbedded in Cetacea


This genus and the three following namely Platylepas Tubicinella
and Xenobalanus have very considerable claims to be separated as a
subfamily as has been proposed by Drs Leach and Gray Although in
structure and habits they are certainly closely related together yet
only few characters can be predicated of all four in commonsome
characters failing in one genus and some in another All four however
differ from the foregoing genera in the opercular valves not being
articulated together being simply united by tough horny membrane
but Chelonobia makes some approach in this respect All four have the
branchi composed of a double fold but this can hardly be considered
a character of much weight as may be inferred from the remarks made
on this subject at p  of the Introduction where the differences
of these four genera from the other genera of the family are discussed
at some length Altogether I have been led to conclude though with
much hesitation that these genera had better not be separated as the
subfamily of Coronulin

Our present genus Coronula is closely related to Platylepas and
likewise to Xenobalanus though this latter genus is so very different
in external aspect that it might easily be mistaken for a pedunculated
Cirripede Lamarck and some other authors have placed the species of
Chelonobia under Coronula but this has arisen as explained under that
genus from a misapprehension of their structure the folded very thin
walls in Coronula having been compared with the radiating septa of
the very thick walls in Chelonobia I may further add that Coronula
has been divided into two genera by Ranzani on palpably insufficient
grounds

General AppearanceThe three recent species of this genus have a
very handsome and striking appearance The shell is highly symmetrical
owing to the six compartments being of the same size and having
exactly the same outline The general shape is either depressed or as
expressed by the name like a crown The walls are longitudinally and
slightly ribbed owing as we shall presently see to their wonderfully
folded structure and the surface is marked by very fine longitudinal
stri crossed by finely beaded lines of growth Hence the walls
offer a strong contrast in appearance with the six smooth radii
of equal breadth The symmetrically hexagonal or roundedhexagonal
orifice of the shell is closed by a thick nearly horizontal membrane
supporting towards the rostral end the small opercular valves with
a slit having protuberant lips in the middle for the protrusion of
the cirri The opercular membrane is attached all round but a short
distance beneath the summit of the shell In regard to size I have
seen a specimen of C diadema two inches in height and two and a half
in diameter

Structure of the ShellThe structure at first appears singularly
complicated and quite unlike that of any other Cirripede but the
whole results simply from the folding of the very thin walls which
in all essential respects are constructed like those in Balanus
In a young specimen of C balnaris having the orifice of the
shell ths of an inch in diameter I found the upper part of each
compartment only slightly sinuous not more so than is common in many
varieties of Balanus but more symmetrical for each compartment had
three slight furrows making for the whole shell eighteen furrows
The ensuing changes during the growth of the shell will be best
understood by looking at the diagrams a b c in fig  Pl
 which are supposed to represent the basal margins of the walls
of a single compartment a shows the simply sinuous wall of the
young shell As the shell grows the furrows rapidly grow deeper and
deeper b and wider and wider at the same time the folds or
ridges between the furrows gradually become drawn out at their ends
into transverse loops c the extremities of which ultimately
become closely pressed togetherthe furrows being thus converted into
cavities extending from the top to the base of the compartments This
structure in the mature shell will be best understood by looking at the
transverse or horizontal section Pl  fig  of the rostral end of
the shell of C diadema in which species the folding of the walls
is simpler than in C balnaris or C regin the walls e are
represented by a double line connected by little cross linesh
being one of the transverse loops at the outer end of one of the folds
and f one of the cavities between the folded walls open at the
bottom of the shell and occupied by the epidermis of the Whale The
walls of the compartments as here represented A being the rostrum
C C the lateral compartments D D the al of the carinolateral
compartments are separated from each other by the broad radii but
if the section had been taken low down near the basis the end of the
folded wall of one compartment would have been separated from that
of the adjoining compartment only by the close suture this will be
understood by a glance at the entire shell given in fig  Pl 
The rostrum of the same species viewed from the inside is shown at
fig  Pl  here it may be observed that the basal margin e e
e of the folded wall is extremely oblique the outer portion having
extended downwards much more than the inner portion this obliquity
is more clearly shown in the lateral view fig  of a lateral
compartment for this figure will equally well serve for a lateral view
of the rostrum fig  if the ala a be supposed to be removed
The section of the rostrum in fig  A will now be intelligible in
relation to the view of the rostrum given in fig  if it be borne in
mind that the section has been taken high up near the letters a
b c in fig 

As above stated the folds or ridges in the young shell become more
and more transversely drawn out at their ends into the transverse
loops till the latter join and touch each other In C balnaris
the lines of junction are simple though very close in the other
species the ends of the transverse loops where touching are finely
and elegantly toothed and thus locked together These teeth appear
single when the shell is viewed either externally or internally but
when the walls along the lines of junction are forced apart they are
seen really to consist of transverse rows of minute teeth These teeth
are less distinct forming only sinuous ridges in C barbara fig
 Pl  in all cases the teeth are formed by the modification
of the very minute beads which ornament the lines of growth on the
external surface of the shell In the rostrum of C diadema as seen
internally fig  Pl  the serrated and closelyfitting lines of
junction f between the ends of the transverse loops of the folded
walls are plainly shown It is the more or less rounded surfaces of the
transverse loops which give to the external surface of the parietes its
longitudinally ribbed structure the ribs are plainest in C diadema
fig  Pl  The shell in fact as seen externally consists of but
an extremely small portion of the external surface of the whole length
of wall being exclusively formed of the transversely looped ends of
the radiating folds together with the radii Owing to the ends of the
transverse loops being so closely pressed together the furrows are
practically converted as already remarked into cavities open only on
the under side of the shell and extending from the oblique bases of
the compartments up to their apices and these are invariably filled
by the black epidermis of the Whale Owing to this circumstance the
skin of the Whale has been mistaken by some authors for parts of the
Cirripede In C diadema in which the summit of the shell is often a
little disintegrated the whales skin is often there exposed forming
three black spots at the top of each compartment It should always be
remembered that these flattened and deep cavities are furrows which
homologically ought to be open in longitudinal lines along the external
surface of the shell from the top to the bottom

As the shell increases in diameter each of the original eighteen
transverse loops forming the exterior surface of the shell increases
in breadth and they would have had to increase extremely had not
some of the transverse loops become during growth divided into two
or three new transverse loops in a manner strictly analogous with the
first formation of the eighteen folds in the young shell In Pl 
fig    we see how one of the circumferential transverse loops
by the formation of a medial furrow or rather bay becomes developed
into two transverse loops and it is rather important to observe
that three new loops might equally well have been contemporaneously
formed By the repeated formation of new circumferential loops and
the consequent formation of new folds the wall of the shell when
old especially in C balnaris becomes folded in a wonderfully
complicated manner as may be seen in Pl  fig  which is an
exact tracing of the extreme basal edge of the wall of a shell of
C balnaris to perceive the full amount of complication it is
advisable to trace the wall of any one of the compartments from one
suture s to another In this figure the sutures are purposely
drawn a little open It may be seen that the new transverse loops and
consequently the new folds of the walls have been in this species
mostly formed in symmetrical order on both sides of the six sutures
this results from the transverse loops on the sutures almost always
giving rise contemporaneously to three new transverse loops In C
diadema the transverse loops on the sutures usually divide into only
two new loops one on the rostral side and one still remaining at the
suture hence the folding of the walls in this species is much less
symmetrical The number however of the transverse loops and the exact
pattern of the folding is variable in all four species of the genus
I may further add to show the complication of the folds that in a
shell of C balnaris having a basal diameter of two inches and
which had the walls as little folded as ever they are yet I found
by careful measurement that the entire basal edge of the wall if
stretched straight would have extended for a length of fiftytwo
inches Therefore if the wall had not been folded but had been simply
circular as in ordinary cirripedes the basal diameter of the specimen
would have been between sixteen and seventeen inches

The central membranous basis is flat but the bottom of the folded
walls of the shell is concave which is caused by the outer ends of the
folded walls having grown at a greater rate than the inner ends The
concavity is deep in C diadema in C balnaris it is much less
so and here the inner hoodlike ends of the folded walls are rather
abruptly but in a variable degree produced downwards generally even
slightly beneath the level of the circumference of the shell this
fact is of interest in relation to the peculiar depending spurlike
processes in the genus Platylepas A lateral view of a compartment in
both these species is given in Pl  figs  and  and by supposing
in each case a compartment to stand opposite at a distance which may
be judged of from fig  the vertical sectional outline of the whole
shell will be understood in fig  of C balnaris however the
inner hoodlike ends of the folded walls are not produced so much
downwards as is usual

In the same manner as the outside of the shell consists of the
transversely expanded ends of the folded walls pressed closely
together so the cavity in which the animals body is lodged is formed
by the inner and less closely joined ends of the folds lined by the
thick sheath a fig  and  Pl  which latter extends down
very near to the basal membrane The cavity for the body is small
compared to the whole shell in C diadema it is deeply cupformed
with a small flat membranous bottom or basis in C balnaris it
is wider and shallower with a broader bottom and with the upper
edges of the walls more inflected In both species the thick membrane
connecting the opercular valves to the shell is attached all round
near the summit of the sheath The uppermost portion of the sheath is
not marked by concentric lines as in most of the Balanid owing to
the opercular membrane not being as we shall presently see regularly
moulted A portion of a single wall when closely examined is found to
be formed of an outer and inner lamina united by longitudinal septa
and is thus permeated by minute square longitudinal poresexactly
as in the normal structure of Balanus The walls are extremely thin
and are striated longitudinally owing to the slight projection on
both the inner and outer surfaces of the longitudinal septa they are
thicker in the part forming the external transverse loops being here
in C balnaris as much as ths of an inch in thickness but
when forming one side of the spokelike folds the thickness is only
ths of an inch The inner lamina is thicker contrary to what is
usual than the outer lamina the sharp tips of the longitudinal septa
project a little beyond either lamina giving to the basal edge of the
wall a serrated outline It is singular that the thin outer lamina
is first formed as a rim or ledge on each side of the longitudinal
septa these ledges being not closely united for some little space up
the wall as is represented in the enlarged drawing of a bit of the
basal wall of C diadema Pl  fig  The open clefts thus left
are of course covered by the socalled epidermis for otherwise
the included threads of corium would have been exposed Each fresh
period of growth in the case of C diadema fig  and regin
and to a certain extent in C balnaris is marked by little knobs
on the longitudinal slightly prominent septa and this prefigures
an analogous strongly marked structure in Tubicinella A fine thread
of corium runs up each pore to the summit of the compartment for
these pores are not as in Balanus cut off by transverse calcareous
septa or have their upper ends solidly filled up with shelly matter
As however the summit of the shell in Coronula is sometimes
disintegrated the threads of corium within the pores would have
been exposed had not each thread formed for itself as I suppose a
transverse membranous septum near the summit of the shell at least
this is the case with the larger pores of the radii The walls where
closely pressed together in the spokelike folds are disunited at
the extreme base but above this they are firmly calcified together
A ribbon of corium runs along the basal edge of each spoke and sends
threads of corium up the parietal pores on each side and its upper
edge serves to deposit calcareous matter homologous with the layers
of the sheath and thus to unite the two walls firmly together In
C diadema the walls of the terminal transverse loops are simply
calcified together like the spokelike portions but in C balnaris
the opposite sides of the loops are united by septa see the transverse
section in Pl  fig  a making from five to eleven longitudinal
tubes within each transverse loop these tubes being larger than the
parietal pores When a piece of the shell is dissolved in acid no
tubuli can be discovered which may be accounted for by the thinness of
the walls nor are there any spines on any of the external membranes
The number of the pores in the parietes of a moderatelysized specimen
of C balnaris I calculated was at  each occupied by a thread
of corium springing from the eighteen branched ribbons diverging from
the corium surrounding the base of the sack To this number must be
added between  and  larger threads of corium running up the
tubes in the transverse loops and no less than about  fringes and
threads occupying the pores in the six radii thus we see that the
dermal system in Coronula is wonderfully complicated

RadiiThe radii are very wide in C diadema In all the species
their summits are square or parallel to the basis Their internal
structure is remarkable as the walls in this genus are extremely thin
so are the proper radii for in fact they consist in this and all
cases as we know of one margin of the wall modified by its lateral
growth against the opposed compartment But as the radii in Coronula
are not plicated like the walls the shell would have been excessively
weak along the six lines of suture had not the radii been strengthened
by numerous sinuous plates springing from the inner lamina of the
proper radius and running downwards attached to the folded wall
of the compartment to which the radius belongs and with their free
edges pressed against the folded wall of the opposed compartment
These plates give out short transverse denticuli making altogether a
beautiful structure as is best seen in Pl  fig  but also in
fig  and  and d in fig  In the section fig  the proper
radius d is seen to be continuous with the wall e and to be
very thin in fact forming but a small portion of the compound radius
it is formed of an outer and inner approximate lamina separated by
septa which are nearly horizontal and which consequently cannot be
shown in the transverse section fig  The outer lamina of the radius
is imperfect or does not reach quite to the suture leaving the septa
a little exposed imperfectly shown in Pl  fig  exactly as is
the case with the outer lamina of the parietes at the basal margin
of the shell In all common Balanid a ribbon of corium runs up each
of the six sutures and sends in fine threads between the septa of
the radii but here a thread of corium runs up a minute cylindrical
pore situated on the line of junction between the radius and the
wall whence it arises and from this longitudinal thread the finer
threads spring which pass between the horizontal septa of the proper
radius this cylindrical pore is rather large in C balnaris but
excessively small in C diadema see a black dot d in section
fig  and is solidly filled up in the upper part of the shell The
plates fig  which run down from the inner lamina of the proper
radius and form the greater part of its thickness are occupied by
fringes of corium extending up from a ribbon of corium running along
each suture like those which run along the bases of the spokelike
folded walls This difference in the origin of the ribbons of corium
occupying the interspaces between the plates and the pores in the
proper radii shows the essential difference between the latter and the
thick inner portions of the compound radii In C balnaris fig 
the compound radius extends from the outside of the shell to the sheath
and to near the basal edges of the folded walls in C diadema fig
 it does not extend so far inwards and downwards and in C regin
fig  even still less so It ensues from this circumstance that
when in these two latter species a transverse section is made across
the middle of the shell a large chamber v fig  occupied by the
ovaria is found on each line of suture s s separating the radii
d and al a

The Al in C diadema section Pl  fig  a and C
regin are of remarkable thickness nearly equal to that of the
radii and in C balnaris of considerable thickness this is
evidently to give strength to the shell which is weakest along the
lines of suture notwithstanding that the radii have been specially
thickened The edge of each ala presents a miniature resemblance of
the edge of the radius namely a central ridge sending off on both
sides sinuous plates themselves denticulated In C balnaris the
ala rests almost entirely on the inner surface of the compound radius
but in the other two species in which as already stated the radii
and al are separated by chambers the ala rests on a plate c in
fig   and  which extends from the top of the radius to the
bottom of the sheath narrowing downwards c fig  and is a
specially developed portion of the sheath for the radius to rest on
In C diadema and regin the sides of the folded walls at the
ends of the chambers v in section fig  are strengthened by the
deposition of layers of shell in connexion with the sheath The sheath
extends close down to the basal membrane in C balnaris and does
not project freely in the other two species it depends freely but
does not run quite so low down I have only further to remark that the
sutures though very strongly united are not calcified together for
they easily separate after the action of caustic potash

The Basis Pl  fig  a c is membranous and is formed of
concentric slips each slip has eighteen angles corresponding with
the open ends see Pl  fig  of the eighteen folds of wall A
ray of membrane runs under each of these folds being prolonged from
the basal membrane but these rays can hardly properly be called parts
of the basal membrane for they split at each period of growth along
the middle and the two halves are drawn from under the basal edges
of the walls and thus come to invest their outer surfaces The basal
membrane and the whole cementing apparatus which is much simpler than
in Balanus has been fully described p  in the Introduction

Opercular ValvesIn the sessile cirripedes hitherto examined the
four opercular valves are inclined towards each other and nearly fill
up the orifice of the shell being united to the walls by a more or
less narrow circular border of membrane this membrane being attached
rather low down to the sheath In Coronula the opercular membrane is
stretched like the skin of a drum almost horizontally across the top
of the shell it is however generally attached to the sheath rather
lower down at the carinal than at the rostral end hence the animals
body as remarked by Burmeister is attached almost horizontally
but this we shall see under Xenobalanus and Tubicinella cannot be
considered a character of much importance The valves are quite small
compared with the opercular membrane and certainly are of little
functional importance The scuta in C balnaris and diadema Pl
 fig  b are subtriangular but the under or growing surface
is elongated and arched These valves stand almost at the rostral
end of the orifice instead of on each side of it In C balnaris
the terga are small with the under surface oval in C diadema
they are either quite aborted or are represented by a barely visible
plate of shell parallel and close to the tergal margin of the scutum
The aperture leading into the sack is formed by a nearly medial slit
of considerable length furnished with irregularly protuberant
inwardly inclined lips These lips are formed by the development of
an inner fold or crest of membrane which can be just detected in
most Cirripedes the lips include a double fold of corium and are
covered by a delicate tunic continuous with that lining the sack and
homologically continuous with the opercular membrane The opercular
membrane is very thick tough and yellowish it is in parts finely
plicated in lines radiating from the apices of the valves these plic
consist of membrane in an altered condition being harder more horny
and of a browner yellow the plic are large at the rostral end of
the scuta and projecting beyond these valves they afford attachment
to the rostral depressor muscles Rims of similarly modified membrane
Pl  fig  b connect the scuta and terga together The rims and
plic are occasionally moulted together with the opercular membrane
In almost all hitherto described Balanid a new opercular membrane is
formed at each period of exuviation and as soon as formed the old one
is generally moulted together with the other membranes of the body
the case is very different in Coronula in which it is evident from
the lines of growth on the valves and sheath that a new membrane is
formed only at rather long intervals and that it is formed in some
degree extensible so as to allow of some growth in the shell Two or
even three of these membranes are retained at the same time one over
the other and thus by their joint thickness they afford protection
to the included animals body and compensate for the smallness of the
opercular valves In a large specimen of C balnaris two inches in
diameter there had been formed since its existence as a very young
shell not more than eight opercular membranes whereas the other
membranes must have been moulted within this same period at least
thirty times In a young specimen of this species having the orifice
of the shell only two tenths of an inch in diameter I found the
opercular membrane as usual double This membrane is not furnished
with spines nor is it penetrated by tubuli as in most other genera
The tissue left after the opercular valves have been dissolved in acid
presents no tubuli or any other recognisable character and is not
divided as is usual into layers

Muscles of the SackThese muscles differ considerably from
those of other sessile cirripedes hitherto described There are the
usual five or properly six the two tergal muscles being here as
elsewhere confluent bundles of fasci but they hardly can be called
bundles they are so much spread out and thin In C balnaris
each rostral muscle consists in different specimens of from three to
five principal fasci these at their upper ends are attached to the
cartilaginous plic at the rostral extremities of the scuta at their
lower ends they do not reach as in all the previous genera to the
basal membrane but after converging they diverge again into a little
fan of fibres which are firmly attached to the corium low down on the
sides of the sack The lateral depressores of the scuta consist each
of about three fasci and they terminate downwards like the rostral
muscles The tergal depressores are spread out into a thin sheet
upwards they reach to the basal edges of the lips of the sackaperture
and downwards they curve a little towards the rostral and opposite end
of the shell and extend nearly to the basal membrane These tergal
muscles include two fasci larger than the others which extend rather
further both upwards and downwards than the other fasci But the
most novel character in these several muscles is that in their lower
portions they do not exhibit transverse stri thus showing a tendency
to become involuntary as in pedunculated cirripedes This circumstance
and their feebleness is easily accounted for by the thick unyielding
nature of the opercular membrane and the feebly developed character
of the opercular valves In C diadema the tergal muscles are much
spread out having as in C balnaris a larger fascia on each side
but the lateral depressores of the scuta form a well defined nearly
cylindrical bundle the rostral pair are extremely weak and spread out
I could perceive only feeble transverse stri on some of these muscles
and on others there was not the least trace of stri I may add that
the adductor scutorum muscle is well developed as are the eight pairs
of muscles which unite the animals body to the under surfaces of
the scuta The action of the adductor scutorum serves to close the
sackaperture but towards the carinal end necessarily with very small
force protection in this part can only be afforded by the protuberant
valvular lips and by the dorsal surfaces of the inwardly curled cirri
with their tufts of bristles

MouthThe mouth Pl  figs   is much elongated
transversely and does not differ essentially from that of most other
Balanid The labrum is notched and not in the least bullate though
in C diadema there is a slight prominence outside close beneath
the notch The palpi are of large size with their bristly apices
touching each other The mandibles are very strong with from four to
five main teeth which are remarkable by presenting only rudiments
of being laterally double but between the second and third and
between the third and fourth main teeth there is a small intermediate
tooththese I have not met with in any sessile cirripede hitherto
described The maxill are small with the two upper spines remarkably
strong The outer maxill are on their inner faces bilobed Between
these organs there is a minute projection or mentum flattened in the
longitudinal axis of the body I have not noticed this in any previous
Cirripede

The Cirri are short and extremely much flattened the three anterior
pairs have their rami unequal in length by two or three segments the
posterior edges of their pedicels are fringed by tufts of extremely
fine hairs The pedicel of the first cirrus is very broad its rami are
short with the segments very broad The rami of the second and third
cirri are short with the segments protuberant in front and thickly
clothed with spines the terminal segments have some short thick
clawlike spines The three posterior pairs have protuberant segments
each supporting three or four pairs of short strong main spines with
a small intermediate tuft the dorsal tuft is small

The prosoma is of large size The stomach is large without cca but
with some internal longitudinal plaits in C balnaris at least
showing a tendency to the formation of cca In the stomach of C
balnaris I found a considerable quantity of a conferva too much I
think to have got in accidentally

Generative systemThe vesicul seminales are large and at their
broad blunt ends in C balnaris four separate vasa deferentia
enter of which fact I have seen no other instance The ovarian tubes
do not extend up the sides of the sack but lie at the bottom over
the basal membrane in C balnaris they send six short raylike
prolongations into the six sutures in C diadema they send similar
prolongations into the sutures and fill up as I believe the six
chambers Pl  fig  v lying between the radii and al I have
examined only one specimen of C diadema in spirits and this had
the ovarian tubes in an early state of development when they can with
difficulty be distinguished from the pulpy corium the orangecoloured
masses however which filled the six cavities resembled the layer
which certainly consisted of undeveloped ovarian tubes and cca lying
over the basal membrane The ova are wonderfully numerous their length
is ths of an inch The larv have been noticed in the anatomical
introduction

BranchiThese are immensely developed covering almost four fifths
of the area of each side of the sack Each consists of two nearly
equal folds attached vertically to the carinal end of the sack and
transversely across the upper end extending to the animals body The
outline of the free part is rounded Both folds of both branchi are
deeply plicated on both sides hence the superficies of the whole is
very great We shall find that this structure is common to the three
following allied genera but with these exceptions I have observed
double branchi only in one species of one other genus namely in
Chthamalus dentatus

AttachmentThe shells adhere with remarkable strength to the
whales skin Having until recently examined only separated
specimens and observing portions of the whales skin adhering to
the outside and solidly filling up the cavities on the under side
I did not doubt that the shell had the power of forming by its own
action a deep cavity in the skin of the whale Inspection of the basal
outline of the walls of the shell Pl  fig  of C balnaris
will show how singularly unfitted its structure is for any burrowing
process and I was led to speculate on the possibility of the pupa
being able to bury itself deeply in the skin but rejected this
view as opposed to what is known of the habits and structure of the
pup of other Cirripedes Having now examined several specimens of
C diadema adhering in a group to a large piece of skin in Mr
Stutchburys collection it has become evident that the attachment
is as much owing to the upward growth of the whales skin as to the
downward growth of the Coronula In Pl  fig  a vertical section
is given of the whales skin taken through the place whence a shell
of C diadema has been removed consequently we here see nothing
but the whales skin the upper black layer is the dark horncoloured
epidermis forming the general surface of the whales body and
resting on an orangecoloured fibrous layer which is lightly shaded
in the drawing The two horns in the section are two of the eighteen
projections formed entirely of the dark epidermic layer which fill up
the eighteen flattened cavities produced by the folding of the walls
Outside the horns we see the section of a circular furrow in which the
circumferential margin of the shell was lodged and between the horns
there is the central hollow within which when lined with shell the
cirripedes body was included The circular furrow is formed in main
part by the epidermic layer being thinner there than on either side
and partly by the orangecoloured underlying fibrous layer curving a
little downwards from having apparently yielded to the pressure of the
circumferential margin of the shell With respect to the cause of the
thinness of the epidermis under the circular furrow I do not know how
much to attribute to mere mechanical compression or stretching and how
much to the pressure of the shell having checked its formation
In the case of very young and small shells it is hardly possible that
their pressure can have in any way influenced the formation of new
epidermic layers under the thick old layers and we must believe at
least in these cases that the whole effect is mechanical the sharp
basal edges of the shell having indented the epidermis but this is
not more surprising than that the radicle of a plant should penetrate
hard ground Whether the indented epidermis in the circular furrow
becomes ruptured I am not sure ragged layers may commonly be observed
outside the shell but it is very possible that these may be the ends
of layers of epidermis which have been preserved by the covering of
the shell whereas on the surrounding parts of the whales body
these same layers have been removed by disintegration To return to
the sectionthe outline of the boss of orangecoloured fibrous
tissue under the central hollow clearly shows that it must have
been formed by its own upward growth for it stands above the general
surrounding level of the corresponding layer This same conclusion is
still more obvious with respect to the eighteen flattened prominent
horns formed of the dark epidermis the manner in which the epidermis
has been forced moulded and packed into the eighteen flattened and
curved cavities of the shell so as to adhere to them with considerable
tenacity is extremely curious The prominence of these horns is so
great that it appears to me quite impossible to account for them
excepting by a special formation of epidermis beneath each cavity
The basal membrane of the Coronula which lies at the bottom of the
central hollow adheres by its own cementing apparatus and when the
larva first attaches itself this adhesion must be very important as
it allows the basal edges of the shell during their slow downward
growth to press firmly on the whales skin and so slowly indent it
with the circular furrow The final cause probably of the cavities
on the under side of the shell in this genus formed by the singularly
convoluted parietes is to allow of the upward growth into them of the
epidermis of the whale thus securing a firm attachment and allowing
the shell to exert a strong downward pressure and thus effect its
partial imbedment and protection from the enormous force of the waves
to which it must be exposed

     Formerly I was inclined to believe as stated in my former
    volume on the Lepadid that the cement injured the true skin of
    the supporting animal but this at least in such cases as the
    present I do not now at all believe

With respect to C balnaris I have seen only specimens preserved
on shrunk and twisted whales skin with the underlying fibrous
layer not preserved but the cavities in the shell were filled by
horns of epidermis exactly as in C diadema There is however
this difference in the attachment of the two species that in C
balnaris owing to its depressed form the circumference of the shell
indents the whales skin not vertically downwards as in C diadema
but very obliquely outwards and consequently buries itself much more
completely but less deeply under a folded and apparently ruptured
flap of the epidermis In young specimens of the size of a shilling
the entire shell with the exception of the operculum is thus covered
up and protected whilst young and tender

Geographical DistributionThe genus is found wherever whales
occur that is from the Arctic to the Equatorial regions in both
hemispheres It is asserted that sometimes as many as a couple of
hundred specimens will adhere to a single whale Coronula barbara
a form closely allied to C diadema existed during the Red Crag
period and Bronn has described some fossil specimens from Italy

AffinitiesIn the wonderfully convoluted shellin the parietal
tubes not being either filled up by calcareous layers or being crossed
by calcareous septain the outer lamina of the shell between the
longitudinal septa near the basis being imperfect Coronula differs
from all the foregoing genera in the two latter respects it agrees
with the three following allied genera viz Platylepas Tubicinella
and Xenobalanus The equal size of all six compartments of the shell
has been observed in very few genera besides Coronula In a new
opercular membrane not being formed at each exuviation and in two or
three of these membranes being persistent and in their being attached
high up the sheath this genus agrees with the three following genera
alone In the valves tending to be rudimentary and in the protuberant
lips of the sackaperture we have a close alliance with Xenobalanus
The muscles of the sack being spread out and tending to lose their
transversely striated character are great peculiarities in Coronula
Tubicinella and Xenobalanus The simplicity of the cementducts is
a remarkable character observed in two of the following genera but
not in Tubicinella The double branchi is a peculiarity common to all
four genera Neither the mouth nor cirri offer any new characters of
much importance in Coronula or in the three allied genera the lower
teeth of the mandibles not being laterally double but having small
intermediate teeth is the newest feature in the mouth

  HabAttached to whales in the Southern Ocean


Having described under the genus in so much detail the structure of
the whole shell it will be sufficient here to point out the characters
by which this species differs from the others


  General AppearanceThe shell is generally much depressed though
  sometimes in large specimens from the turning in of the basal
  edges a considerable degree of convexity is acquired The radii
  are moderately wide and give a starlike appearance to the shell
  The surface of the whole upper part of the shell is smooth the
  broad and much flattened ribs i e the terminal transverse
  loops of the folded walls of which each compartment is formed
  generally divide at a short distance from the apex The close sutures
  separating these ribs are straight and not finely serrated by which
  character alone this species can at once be discriminated from the
  others The surface when closely examined is found to be finely
  striated longitudinally and is transversely crossed chiefly in
  the lower part by minutely beaded growthridges The orifice is
  roundedhexagonal and is small compared with the whole shell it is
  also smaller than the basal edge of the internal cavity of the shell
  consequently the whole basal edge cannot be seen through the orifice
  from one point of viewthe operculum of course having been removed
  An unusually large specimen was  of an inch in diameter this
  individual was one of the more convex varieties and yet its entire
  thickness from top to base was only  of an inch

  OperculumHaving described under the genus the general
  structure of the opercular valve I will here only add a few details
  on their shape They are small compared with the whole extent of
  the opercular membrane The scuta Pl  fig  b scutum to
  the left stand near each other at the rostral end of the aperture
  leading into the sack with their two rostral ends united by the
  yellowishbrown longitudinally plicated horny membrane described
  under the genus The terga fig  b stand a little apart from
  the scuta on the sides of nearly the middle of the sackaperture
  The lips are protuberant and moderately developed all round The
  scuta are elongated and a little curved including the upper
  imbedded portion they are almost subtriangular but the under
  growing surface is much elongated nearly flat with the two ends
  of nearly the same width truncated and rounded The Tergum in
  rather small specimens is if the upper imbedded portion be included
  subtriangular with the growing surface oval and between one third
  and one half of the length of the scutum but in large specimens
  the tergum becomes styleformed lying parallel to the tergal margin
  of the scutum with the growing surface proportionally much smaller
  and not above one fifth of the length of the growing surface of
  the scutum Hence we see some tendency in the tergum to become
  rudimentary as it is in the next species The brown horny plicated
  substance in which the terga are imbedded extends considerably
  beyond the valves themselves

  Structure of the Shell and RadiiI have already so fully
  discussed this subject that I will here only enumerate the points in
  which this species differs from C diadema and reginFirstly
  the more symmetrically folded walls Pl  fig  new folds
  arising on both sides of all six sutures Secondly the inner ends of
  the folded walls which surround the internal cavity being almost
  square but with their angles rounded their inner ends descend some
  little way beneath the basal edge of the sheath as low or lower
  than the circumference of the shell Thirdly the external lines of
  junction between the transverse terminal loops being smooth or not
  serrated Fourthly these loops being flatter towards the outside
  and being internally filled by septa Pl  fig  a tubes
  being thus formed larger than the proper parietal pores Sixthly the
  sutural edges of the compound radii Pl  fig  being very much
  broader in the inner and upper part of each compartment than in the
  outer and lower part for in the inner and upper part they stretch
  from the outside of the shell to the sheath so that the al rest on
  them and hence no large open cavity is left between the radii and
  al in the inner and upper part also the radii extend down nearly
  to the basal edges of the folded walls The septa of which the radii
  are formed stand further apart than in C diadema and regin
  Seventhly the al are only th or th of the thickness of the
  radii whereas in the two other species they are very much thicker
  being nearly as thick as the radii the al are also here fig 
  a squarer than in those two species that is their basal margins
  are not so short compared with their upper margins their edges
  present also a slightly different structure Eighthly the basal
  edge of the sheath does not here project freely and does not descend
  quite so close to the basal membrane

  MouthThe palpi are furnished with a row extending along the
  whole basal exterior margin of very long upwardly pointing spines
  on their upper edges there is a brush of small spines The edge of
  the labrum is clothed with extremely fine spines and is furnished
  with a few minute teeth The mandibles have four teeth and the lower
  end is broadly rounded and coarsely spinose the second and third
  teeth are double at their points and between the second and third
  and again between the third and fourth there is a small intermediate
  tooth

  Regarding the Cirri I have nothing especial to remark

  Geographical DistributionI have examined nine sets of specimens
  having localities attached to them three from off New South Wales
  two off the Cape of Good Hope two from the west coast of South
  America and two marked only South Sea Hence I am led to conclude
  that this species is confined to the southern hemisphere or if it
  extends into the northern hemisphere it is probably only in the
  Pacific Ocean I do not believe though so stated in some works that
  this species occurs on the shores of Europe It seems often to be
  associated with Tubicinella Some specimens thus associated sent by
  Mr Bennett to Professor Owen were said to have been attached to the
  Balna australis

Shell crownshaped with longitudinal convex ribs having their edges
crenated orifice hexagonal radii moderately thick very broad terga
absent or rudimentary

  HabAttached to whales in the Arctic Seas United States and
  Great Britain GulfStream Atlantic Ocean New Zealand


  General AppearanceAs previously remarked owing to the fulness
  of the generic description minute details on structure excepting
  those characteristic of the present species need not here be given
  The crownlike shape of the shell is well expressed by its name of
  Diadema but the crown tends to pass into a cylinder The radii are
  extremely broad The orifice is large and neatly hexagonal when
  the operculum is removed the whole inside of the cupformed shell
  can be seen at once for the flat membranous basis is much smaller
  than the orifice The under side of the shell is deeply concave
  The outside of each compartment is formed by broad rounded and
  somewhat prominent rarely divided ribs i e the transverse
  ends of the folded walls these ribs are closely united together
  by finely serrated lines of junction Pl  fig  f Their
  surfaces outside are delicately striated longitudinally and plainly
  crossed more plainly than in the foregoing and the next species by
  irregular transverse ridges especially in the lower part of the
  shell The largest specimen which I have seen was two and a half
  inches in diameter and two in height

  ScutaThese are placed close together at the rostral end of the
  orifice and are imbedded in the brownish tough longitudinally
  plicated horny substance which extends far beyond both ends of the
  valves In outline fig  b they are mitreshaped or rounded
  and subtriangular a little curved and more or less elongated
  being most so in young specimens they are however less elongated
  and rather more massive than in C balnaris Tergathese seem
  entirely absent in most specimens but in one fig  a I found
  a rudiment namely a short thin plate of shell barely visible to
  the naked eye extending parallel and near to the tergal margin of
  the scutum The lips of the aperture of the sack are prominent and
  highly so towards the carinal end

  Structure of Shell and RadiiOwing to the shell not spreading
  much at the base new folds in the walls are much seldomer formed
  and therefore the external longitudinal ribs i e the terminal
  transversely elongated loops are much seldomer divided than in C
  balnaris or regin even rather large specimens sometimes having
  only the original eighteen folds When new folds are formed
  only one is formed on one viz the rostral side of each suture
  instead of on both sides as in C balnaris The inner ends of the
  folded walls surrounding the basal membrane are narrow instead
  of being almost square as in C balnaris The lower edge of the
  sheath which projects freely descends almost to the level of the
  basal edges of the walls The outer ends of the folded walls forming
  the transverse loops are internally filled up solidly by calcareous
  matter instead of by septa forming tubes as in C balnaris
  The radii Pl  fig  are a little thicker in the lower and
  outer than in the upper and inner part of each compartment in the
  middle they do not reach the sheath by about half the thickness of
  the compartment and consequently they are separated from the plates
  c in fig  and  on which the al rest by large chambers v
  in fig  which extend up to nearly the apices of the compartments
  the extent however to which the upper ends of these chambers have
  been solidly filled up varies a little The sinuous plates forming
  the main portion of the compound radii are rather thinner and closer
  together than in C balnaris The al are thick being thickest in
  the middle part and there equal the radii in thickness their lower
  margins are very short compared with their upper margins hence they
  are almost wedgeformed

     These should be counted on the under side of the shell
    for if counted from the outside the number would be thought to
    be twentyfour as on the side of each compartment bordering the
    radius a halffold has the appearance of being a whole fold so
    that in appearance six folds are added to the real number of the
    folds This caution is necessary whatever the number of real folds
    may be that is whether or not the original eighteen folds have
    been increased by subsequent plications These remarks also are
    applicable to the other species

  MouthThe teeth and fine hairs on the labrum are sometimes
  obscure and sometimes plain close outside the bottom of the medial
  notch there is a small hard prominence The palpi are broad on
  their basal exterior margins there is a short row of spines which
  do not equal in length the width of the palpi and therefore are not
  so long as in C balnaris The mandibles have five main teeth of
  which the second and third show only an obscure rudiment of being
  double between these two teeth and between the third and fourth
  tooth there is a small intermediate tooth the inferior angle is
  narrow rounded and spinose The extremity of the apodeme of the
  maxill is expanded

  CirriI have only to remark that the pedicel of the first cirrus
  is extremely broad and that the rami are set on in an unusually
  crooked manner the basal segment of the shorter and broader ramus of
  this cirrus has its dorsal surface produced into a plate fringed with
  very fine hairs

  Geographical DistributionI have received only four specimens
  with certain localities attached to them namely the Arctic Seas of
  Scandinavia the coast of the United States and of Britain and the
  GulfStream There is also a specimen in the British Museum sent by
  Mr Stephenson mingled with shells of Mollusca from New Zealand
  but a Coronula procured from a floating whale in the early part
  of the outward voyage might so easily be sent home with specimens
  subsequently collected in another county that I do not as yet fully
  admit that this species is an inhabitant of the Southern Pacific
  Ocean I am less willing to admit this from suspecting that C
  regin in the Pacific replaces the C diadema of our Northern
  Seas

  HabAttached to whales Pacific Ocean Mus Cuming Stutchbury
  and Darwin


I have seen eight specimens of this formtwo in Mr Cumings
collection one of which was procured at Iquique in Peru the other
from an unknown locality one was given me in Chile and was stated
to have come from the Pacific two others are in Mr Stutchburys
collection from unknown but distinct localities and three in a
group in the British Museum These eight specimens of which six were
collected separately all strikingly agree in general aspect and in
details of structure so that I can easily recognise the shell and can
at once pick out a single compartment when mingled with those of the
two foregoing species nevertheless the differences are so small that
I at first hesitated whether to name the species but upon reflection
I am convinced that it is distinct Coronula regin is much more
closely related to C diadema than to C balnaris and I suspect
that it replaces in the Pacific the former of these two species


  General Appearance shell conical straightsided some specimens
  being nearly as much depressed as C balnaris and considerably
  more depressed than any variety of C diadema other specimens
  being globuloconical but rather less globular than the ordinary
  form of C diadema I may here remark that shape is of more value
  in this genus in which the shell is attached to the yielding skin
  of whales than in those genera in which it adheres to rocks The
  orifice is neatly hexagonal and the whole internal cavity when the
  opercular membrane is removed can be seen from one point of view
  owing to the contraction of the lower part of the cavity and small
  size of the basal membrane The surface of the shell is smooth but
  has even up to the summit a peculiar frosted appearance different
  from that of the foregoing species caused by the longitudinal
  stri being rather more distinct and being crossed by beaded very
  delicate transverse lines of growth The ends of the transverse
  loops forming the exterior surfaces of the compartments are much
  flattened even more so than in C balnaris The lines of junction
  between the loops are finely serrated as in C diadema and
  internally they are solidly filled up instead of being formed into a
  set of tubes by longitudinal septa as in C balnaris The under
  side of the shell with its folded walls presents an appearance
  intermediate between the variable appearance of this part in the
  above two species

  The sutural edges of the radii Pl  fig  offer by far the
  most remarkable character in their thinness from top to bottom for
  they hardly exceed one fifth of the thickness of the compartment
  measured from the external surface to the base of the sheath hence
  a very large cavity is left between the radii and al in the
  thickness of the radii the three species already described form a
  series C regin at one end and C balnaris at the other The
  sinuous plates forming the lower part of the radius are coarser and
  stand rather further apart than in C diadema The al are thick
  and have the same outline being narrow at their basal margins and
  broad at top as in C diadema with their sutural edges similarly
  constructed the basal edge of the sheath likewise projects freely

  OperculumThis resembles most closely that of C diadema There
  are no rudiments of terga The scuta cannot be distinguished from
  those of C diadema

  MouthThe labrum has a row of inwardly curved little teeth along
  the whole crest and these I did not notice in C diadema there
  is only a trace of the prominence on the outside at the bottom of
  the central notch The hairs on the basal exterior margin of the
  palpi are moderately long The mandibles have five teeth In the
  Cirri the first pair resembles in its peculiar structure those of
  C diadema In the sixth pair however the segments support only
  three pairs of main spines but the specimen was not very large and
  probably in old specimens there would have been four pairs

  SummaryThe present species differs from both the foregoing
  only in its rather more conical and straightsided outline smooth
  frosted surface and in the narrowness of the sutural edges of the
  radii and consequent large size of the chambers between the radii
  and al It resembles C diadema as far as the shell is concerned
  in the external ribs or transverse loops having their lines of
  junction serrated and in being solidly filled upin the shape of
  the orifice and of the internal cavity of the shellin the shape
  and structure of the aland in the basal edge of the sheath being
  free It comes nearer to C diadema than to C balnaris in the
  structure of the radii It differs from C diadema and comes
  nearer to C balnaris in the external ribs being flattened
  instead of being convex and in the lines of growth being very
  delicate But as it resembles C diadema in the several foregoing
  characters of its shell in the opercular valves in all parts of the
  mouth excepting the labrum and in the cirri it is very much more
  nearly related to that species than to C balnaris

between the radii and the al solidly filled up

  Fossil in Red Crag Bawdsey and Sutton Mus S Wood and
  Geological Society


The species here described though near to C diadema and easily
confounded with it I have no doubt is distinct I owe to the kindness
of the Rev Mr Image an examination of the original specimen figured
by Parkinson and in Mr Stutchburys collection there is a similar and
more perfect specimen both of these resemble C diadema in general
form but have been too much worn to be positively identified The
following description is drawn up from some compartments collected by
Mr Searles Wood belonging certainly to three and probably to four
individuals one of which was young as these specimens agree in all
essential respects I feel pretty confident that the characters by
which the present species differs from C diadema are of specific
value


  Structure of ShellThe longitudinal ribs on each compartment
  i e the terminal transverse loops are convex and prominent
  as in C diadema but they are crossed by more prominent ridges
  of growth than even in the roughest varieties of that species so
  that the surface of the shell is more rugged In the three previous
  species the surface of the wall entirely round the cavities occupied
  by the whales skin is striated only by longitudinal very fine
  lines but here the outer portion or that fig  formed by each
  transverse loop is crossed by transverse ridges of growth like
  but less prominent than those on the external surface of the shell
  The minute teeth along the lines of junction between the transverse
  loops are here less regular and can hardly be said to exist for
  the two edges are locked together by what may be more strictly
  called minute zigzag ridges than teeth The exact number of the
  circumferential plications in the walls is variable in the same
  manner as in the three foregoing species The sutural edges of the
  radii are about as thick as or rather thicker than in C diadema
  As in this latter species and in C regin each ala rests not
  on the internal surface as in C balnaris and in all other
  Balanid of the radius but on a special plate but in C barbara
  instead of a deep chamber running up to the apex of the compartment
  being left between the radius and ala this part is filled up almost
  entirely by solid shell Although the extent to which this chamber is
  filled up varies a little and although its depth varies a little in
  C diadema yet there is a marked difference between the specimens
  of this latter species in which the chamber is most filled up and
  those of C barbara in which it is least filled up The al are
  thick as in C diadema and their sutural edges have a central
  ridge sending off on both sides sinuous ridges The basal margins
  of the al are not short compared with their upper margins and
  therefore the whole ala is not wedgeformed and in this rather
  important respect C barbara resembles C balnaris Pl 
  fig  and differs from C diadema fig  The lower edge of
  the sheath does not seem to have projected freelyin this respect
  also resembling C balnaris From the basal margin of the al not
  being narrow and from the inner ends of the folded walls being as
  it would appear also broad I have little doubt that the cavity in
  which the animals body was lodged resembled in shape that in C
  balnaris the membranous basis being larger than the orifice of the
  shell

  Opercular valves unknown

  SummaryThis species is more nearly related to C diadema than
  to the others but in some points just specified it resembles C
  balnaris The characters by which it differs from all the species
  are firstly the more prominent transverse ridges on the external
  surface of the shell and more especially on the surfaces bounding
  the outer sides of the cavities occupied by the epidermis of the
  whale Secondly the character of the teeth or rather ridges along
  the lines of junction between the transverse loops And thirdly the
  spaces between the radii and the plates on which the al rest being
  solidly filled up


Species Dubi

The Coronula bifida is an Italian tertiary species so named by
Bronn in his Italiens TertirGebilde  p  It is very
possible that this may be identical with C barbara but Bronn does
not seem to have been aware of the absolute necessity of giving minute
details in his descriptions of fossil cirripedes The chief character
of C bifida is thus givenEine tiefe Furche oder Spalte theilt
die Lngenrippe von oben herab bis zur Hlfte welche bei der sonst
hnlichen C diadema entweder ganz fehlt oder nur zuweilen kurz
angedeutet ist Had it been stated that the longitudinal ribs were
divided from the middle down to the base instead of from the top to
the middle the description would have been intelligible to me though
the character thus afforded would not have been of specific value as
this dividing of the ribs occasionally occurs in all four species and
is produced by the formation of new folds to the walls

Compartments six each bilobed and inwardly produced so as to form
six midribs which support the outwardly convex membranous basis

  Distribution throughout the tropical and warmer temperate seas
  Imbedded in turtles seasnakes and manatee


This small genus consisting of three species though I have named
only two is a very natural one yet closely allied to Coronula Most
authors have united these genera but in doing so they destroy two very
natural little groups Platylepas moreover when all its characters
are considered has as good a claim to be generically separated from
Coronula as has Tubicinellaa genus universally admitted I shall
presently recur to this subject

General AppearanceThe most remarkable character and which
gives a peculiar aspect to the whole shell is that each of the six
compartments has a medial fissure or fold the shell thus consisting
of twelve lobes Each fold extends from the summit to the base of
the shell and is produced inwards in the shape of a midrib Pl 
fig  a The membranous basis is supported by the basal edges of
the six midribs and is thus rendered convex As the midrib on the
rostrum would have interfered if fully developed with that part of
the animals thorax which I have called the prosoma it is of less size
than the other midribs and from this same cause the whole rostrum is
pushed a little on one side generally to the left so that the shell
is not perfectly symmetrical The midrib of the carina is less than
the lateral midribs The orifice is oval and is more or less plainly
indented by six angular pointsthe worndown summits of the six
midribs The narrow elongated opercular valves stretch from one end of
the orifice to the other The rostrum is much broader than the carina
the lateral compartments are but little broader than the carinolateral
compartments The radii are narrow though variable in width The
general shape of the shell varies much in the same species being
either much depressed or rather steeply conical either circular or
more commonly oval The so called epidermis is usually persistent
in the lower part of the shell The shell itself is white The basal
diameter of the largest specimen of P bissexlobata was nearly
threequarters of an inch

Structure of the Parietes Radii cThe walls of the shell in P
bissexlobata are permeated by minute pores and have exactly the same
structure as in Coronula the pores being completed by the union of
ledges on the outer sides of the longitudinal septa and the latter
have little knobs formed on them at each period of growth In P
decorata the walls are solid Each compartment as already stated has
a deep nearly medial furrow the sides of which are closely pressed
together thus forming the midribs and thus differing from the furrows
in Coronula which not being pressed together form cavities on the
under side of the shell The inner longitudinal margin of each midrib
is thickly coated by a layer of shell and is thus rendered much more
prominent than it would have been if formed exclusively by the inward
folding of the wall The upper part of each midrib forms a slight
longitudinal ridge fig  d on the sheath having become encased
by the sheath during its downward growth Owing to the small size of
the midrib of the rostrum there is scarcely any ridge on the sheath
of this compartment The sheath does not descend halfway down the
walls in P bissexlobata but further down in P decorata but
perhaps the thickened inner margins of the midribs may be considered as
the downward prolongations of the sheath and on this view the sheath
descends actually to the basal membrane The radii are narrow their
edges have simple septa with the interspaces filled up solidly The
al have their sutural edges smooth

The Basis is membranous and more or less convex This convexity
is rendered possible by the support afforded by the basal edges of
the six midribs The socalled epidermis or membrane which covers the
shell is prolonged in six flaps under the midribs and hence the
proper basal membrane has six deep indentations receiving the above
flaps The cementing apparatus is constructed on the same simple type
as in Coronula as has been described in the Introduction

Scuta and TergaThese are narrow and long stretching the whole
length of the orifice of the shell The two valves touch each other
but are not properly articulated together their upper surfaces
scale off in layers they resemble each other very closely in shape
fig  c being simply oblong The membrane covering the valves
supports some very minute spines th of an inch in length When
a portion of valve is dissolved in acid it is seen to be penetrated
by very numerous tubuli The opercular membrane is rather thick in
P decorata I found it occasionally double in this species it
supports some very minute spines it is attached about one third down
the sheath of which the upper part is not marked as in Balanus by
regular concentric rings The aperture between the valves leading
into the sack has protuberant lips as in Coronula and Tubicinella
The normal five bundles of muscles surrounding the sack differently
from in the two genera just mentioned do not thin out and spread
out downwards but retaining their full thickness reach the basal
membrane to which they are attached

Mouth the parts present no difference from those in Coronula
between the outer maxill we have the same small flattened mentumlike
projection and in the mandibles the same small intermediate teeth
between the second and third and between the third and fourth main
teeth as in that genus The main teeth here are more plainly double
laterally There are teeth on each side of the central notch of the
labrum The cirri differ little from those of Coronula but the
segments are not nearly so much flattened and broad and the second and
third pairs are not so short The segments of the sixth pair support
four pairs of main spines with a few minute intermediate spines but
with no intermediate tuft

Branchi these consist on each side at least in P decorata of a
double fold much less plicated than in Coronula the fold nearest to
the animals body is rounder and not quite so large as the outer fold

Range and HabitsThe P bissexlobata ranges from the
Mediterranean and west coast of Africa to the West Indies to the
northeast coast of Australia and judging from the name given by
Chenu to California the second species P decorata inhabits the
Pacific Ocean and the third imperfectly known species was deeply
buried in the skin of a seasnake off Borneo The P bissexlobata
is attached both to turtles and to the skin of the manatee some
specimens in the British Museum attached to the latter from the west
coast of Africa were entirely buried in the skin with the exception
of the operculum The specimens of P decorata which I obtained at
the Galapagos Archipelago were buried about half their depth in the
softer parts of the skin of the green turtle I do not doubt that the
imbedment is effected in the same manner as in the case of Chelonobia

AffinitiesThis genus in general structure and habits approaches
closely to Coronula but it differs from all the species of that genus
in the following respects which appears to me fully to justify its
generic separationThe outline is often oval instead of circular
the compartments are not of equal sizes and shapes each compartment
has here only one inward furrow or fold and this has its sides pressed
closely together and is encased but not obliterated by the sheath
the rostrum is not quite medial and the radii are narrow and nearly
solid The opercular valves again are here more developed and
their microscopical structure is different The opercular membrane is
less constantly double and what is much more important the muscles
of the sack are not here spread out and show no tendency to become
rudimentary and lose their transverse stri The cirri differ only in
not being so broad and flattened The branchi are not quite so much
developed Finally I may add that in several of the above respects in
which Platylepas differs from Coronula it approaches ordinary sessile
cirripedes

  elegantly sculptured appearance occasionally the longitudinal ridges
  formed by the parietal septa are distinct Basal diameter of largest
  specimen three quarters of an inch

  Structure of ShellI have nothing material to add to the generic
  description The midribs are not so prominent as in the following
  species and hence the basal membrane is less convex The origin
  of the midrib as a fold is very plain The sheath descends barely
  halfway down the walls and is a little hollow on its under margin
  on each side of the midrib Beneath the sheath the parietes are
  finely ribbed fig  d but to a variable degree I may here
  remark that in the specimens taken from manatee on the coast of
  Africa and at Honduras the internal ribs extended further up and
  were plainer and the opercular valves seemed to be a little narrower
  than in the other specimens so that I at first suspected that they
  were specifically distinct but I could make out no other than these
  small and variable points of difference

  Scuta oblong fig  c about twice as long as broad with the
  rostral end rounded rather narrower than the other end and curled a

  end of the valve and when viewed internally the growing surface
  of this end is seen to be bluntly pointed In both valves the upper
  layers of shell usually scale off

  Mouth and Cirri The only differences compared with the following
  species that I perceived were that the hairs at the end of the

  rather less distinct The rami of the first cirrus are very unequal

  at its lower margin it descends more than halfway down the walls
  The midribs formed by the folded walls are more prominent than in

  more convex than in the last species for it projects downwards as
  much as the shell projects upwards In mediumsized specimens the
  midribs project inwards to a distance exceeding half the breadth of a
  compartment A less proportional length of the midrib in an inward
  direction is formed by the inward folding of the wall and a greater
  length by the thickening of its inner longitudinal margin than in
  the last species The basal edge of the inner end of the midrib is
  smooth

  I obtained at the Galapagos Islands was about  of an inch in
  diameter and I found none larger but Mr Cumings specimens from
  Lord Hoods Island are half an inch in diameter

  Opercular ValvesThese closely resemble those of the former
  species with the exception that the carinal end of the growing or
  under surface of the Tergum is much squarer

  CirriThe only difference which I could perceive was that the
  rami of the first pair were not quite so unequal in length





Species Dubi

 PLATYLEPAS 

  HabImbedded in the skin of a seasnake taken off Borneo


I am indebted to Dr Gray for a single specimen of this supposed
species but as it is very young and imperfect wanting the opercular
valves and cirri I do not choose to name it The shell presents all
the usual characters of the genus the rostrum I may remark being
pushed to the left side The parietes are permeated by pores of
considerable size which shows that the species is distinct from P
decorata On the inner basal surfaces of the walls there are two or
three very distinct ridges on each side of the midrib and this fact
together with the size of the parietal pores makes me suspect that it
is not an immature specimen of P bissexlobata

This genus is closely allied to Coronula and perhaps De Blainville was
right in uniting them But Coronula as it now stands is so natural
a genus that it seems a pity that a form so entirely different in
general aspect as Tubicinella should be forced into it The main
difference between these genera consists in the walls being here not
folded in the simpler radii and in the general shape of the shell and
of the included animals body but there are many other minor points
of difference The most novel character in Tubicinella consists in
the shell being lined almost close down to the basis by the opercular
membrane In the opercular membrane thus forming a long tube and in
the general shape of the animals body we shall presently see that
Tubicinella is closely related to Xenobalanus In numerous other
respects Tubicinella is almost equally allied to the latter genus
to Platylepas and to Coronula Finally several points of structure
indicate that Tubicinella may be considered as a Coronula with the
shell much simplified in structure

     It may be observed that I have here broken through the great
    law of priority for it appears to me too grossly incorrect to
    retain the specific name either of major or minus in a genus
    including a single species Lamarck himself seems to have been
    of this opinion by giving in  the new specific name of
    balnarum but Shaws name of trachealis has the clear right to
    priority if major or minus be rejected


  General AppearanceShell elongated subcylindrical with the
  upper end rather wider than the lower and therefore widening in
  a direction the reverse of that usual with sessile cirripedes
  The shell is often a little bent to one or the other side it is
  surrounded by from two or three to about ten very prominent strong
  blunt ridges or belts placed at rather irregular distances from
  each other The surface is finely striated longitudinally The six
  compartments are of nearly equal sizes and shapes In fullgrown
  specimens the parietes are not wider at the base and often they are
  even a little narrower than at the summit of the shell in young
  specimens the parietes do widen a little downwards The radii are
  narrow but in young specimens they are proportionably much broader
  Pl  fig  b than in old specimens The whole compartment
  including the radius and wall is always a little wider at the summit
  than at the base in accordance with the shape of the whole shell
  The operculum consists of four nearly equalsized similar valves
  projecting above the upper end of the shell which is always broken
  and jagged the valves are united to the sheath by a very thick
  much folded membrane The aperture leading into the sack is bordered
  by very prominent lips projecting above the opercular valves the
  latter have their upper layers always scaled off The shell is
  imbedded in the whales skin up to the level of its operculum The
  largest specimen which I have seen was barely one inch  in
  diameter at the summit and  in length the longest specimen which
  I have seen scarcely attained a length of one inch and three quarters

  Structure of the ShellThe parietes are thin and if the sheath
  which extends to near the basis be removed they are rendered
  extremely thin They are formed by an outer and inner lamina united
  by fine longitudinal septa projecting at the basis beyond the
  lamin The pores thus produced which in a transverse section are
  oblong in outline run up to the summit of the shell and are not
  filled up by shelly matter but I presume that the included tubular
  threads of corium are protected at the broken upper end of the
  shell by transverse membranous septa The outer lamina of shell
  as in Coronula is formed though obscurely by the union of ledges
  projecting from the longitudinal septa The circular prominent belts
  surrounding the shell are formed by the longitudinal septa at
  certain irregular and rather distant periods growing outwards the
  wall at each belt being increased to nearly twice its thickness in
  other parts At each belt the threads of corium within the parietal
  pores lend off minute branches to supply the thickened wall These
  belts which continuously surround the shell correspond as is best
  seen in young specimens with the little knobs or beads which in
  Coronula Pl  fig  rise separately and not quite regularly
  on the longitudinal parietal septa and which I believe are formed
  at every successive period of growth here they are much larger
  stand in straight transverse rows become confluent and are formed
  only at occasional intervals The whole external surface of the shell
  is covered by membrane stronger and more persistent than is usual
  with most cirripedes

  Internally the sheath extends almost to the basis of the much
  elongated shell and terminates in a slight shoulder it is divided
  as in common Balanid and differently from in Coronula into zones
  of growth but these are very broad at the upper end of the shell
  which as will hereafter be explained is always breaking away
  the sheath readily yields along the oblique planes which separate
  the zones of growth and dip outwards a similar but less strongly
  marked structure occurs in Platylepas and in no other genus We
  shall presently see that the sheath presents a much more anomalous
  character in being lined down to its basal edge by the innermost and
  lastformed layers of the opercular membrane

  RadiiThe radii are narrow The belts which surround the shell
  are prolonged with slightly diminished prominence across the radii
  their formation being simply due to the radii being here thicker than
  in other parts It can be seen more plainly in Tubicinella than in
  other Balanid that the membrane externally investing the shell
  splits along the radii during the diametric growth of the shell
  and is continually repaired and added to along these lines by new
  longitudinal slips of membrane The radius consists as usual of an
  inner and outer lamina which latter does not extend quite to the
  line of suturea slightly gaping fissure being thus left The two
  lamin are connected by septa which are not denticulated but near
  the outer lamina bi or trifurcate and the ends of the branches
  thus formed spread out forming a sort of outer scalloped lamina in
  advance of the true outer lamina The fine threads of corium running
  between these septa do not spring as in all common cirripedes from
  a fillet of corium occupying the actual suture but from two nearly
  circular threads of corium occupying two tubes which run along the
  line of junction between the radius and the compartment whence it
  springs In Coronula alone we have a nearly similar structure for
  the fine threads of corium occupying the proper radius spring from
  a single very minute tube Pl  fig  d occupying the
  same position with the two tubes in Tubicinella I may further add
  that the structure of the proper radius in Coronula is precisely the
  same as here just described but being on so very minute a scale I
  did not there describe it so carefully as I have here done

  Al these are only remarkable from their extreme thinness for
  they are not thicker than the inner lamina of the radius Their
  sutural edges are quite smooth Forming part of the sheath they
  extend down close to the basis of the shell where instead of as in
  general ending abruptly in a rectangular shoulder they slope off
  into their own compartment

  BasisThe basal membrane is complicated owing to the shell when
  fullgrown barely or not at all increasing in diameter and in
  consequence membrane after membrane each with its own cementducts
  attached to it are thrown down one nearly over the other In the
  Introduction p Pl  fig  I have fully described the
  cementing apparatus which is very curious from one of the ducts
  always having a loop with two spurs projecting from it The basal
  membrane does not equal in diameter the base of the shell for the
  membrane externally covering the walls is inflected inwards all round
  for a considerable width and is then united to the basal membrane
  in Coronula the basal membrane extends only under the internal
  cavity of the shell and not under the folded walls and therefore
  presents a somewhat analogous structure

  Opercular ValvesThe scuta and terga are nearly of the same size
  and shape they are mitreformed and higher than broad They do not
  fill up the orifice of the shell The scutum is a little larger than
  the tergum and rather less symmetrical the rostral corner of the
  valve being a little produced There is no hollow or crest for the
  adductor muscle which is small In the tergum there is no trace of
  a spur The two valves are not articulated together but standing
  close to each other are united as well as the scutum to the scutum
  and tergum to the tergum by thick brown tough yet soft membrane
  in layers continuous with but differing in appearance from the
  surrounding opercular membrane The layers of shell forming the
  valves are thick and only the three or four lower layers are
  usually preserved the upper ones having symmetrically scaled off
  leaving snowwhite surfaces Owing to the thickness of the successive
  shelly layers and to the circumstance of each new layer being but
  very little larger than the last the scaling off of the old upper
  layers is a quite necessary process for otherwise the orifice into
  the sack would have been encumbered and almost closed by four long
  slightly tapering points prolonged upwards from the basal layers
  that form the four existing valves The same scaling off process
  takes place in Platylepas and amongst pedunculated cirripedes in
  Lithotrya Microscopical examination does not exhibit any fine
  spines on the membrane investing the valves or any tubuli in the
  shelly layers after their dissolution in acid in this respect the
  valves resemble those of Coronula The summits of the valves project
  freely for about a third of their own height above the level of
  the membrane by which they are surrounded The orifice leading into
  the sack is bordered by very protuberant lips standing up even
  considerably above the upper freely projecting portions of the valves

  The Opercular Membrane connecting the valves and the top of the
  shell is thick and tough and deeply folded in concentric wrinkles
  As in Coronula it consists of two or three separate membranes each
  composed of many lamin one over the other united to successive
  shelly layers of the opercular valves As the upper shelly layer
  scales off the membrane attached to it is likewise thrown off The
  innermost lamin of the lastformed opercular membrane extend down
  closely attached to the sheath to its basal edge and therefore
  nearly to the basis of the shell the outer and older lamin all
  closely attached one within the other and to the sheath extend to
  a less and less distance downwards consequently the animals body
  is enclosed in a tube thinning out downwards formed by the lamin
  of the successive opercular membranes surrounded outside by the
  shell only in the following genus Xenobalanus shall we meet with a
  nearly analogous structure As the shell of Tubicinella increases in
  diameter from the growth of the radii the opercular membrane lining
  the sheath is necessarily split along the six lines of suture in the
  same manner as is the membrane externally investing the shell in a
  like manner also it is repaired and added to by new longitudinal
  slips of membrane Of this structure in the opercular membrane I
  have seen no other instance for in most genera the old opercular
  membrane is moulted and a new and larger one formed at each period
  of growth in Coronula in which the opercular membrane is likewise
  for a time persistent it does not run far down the inside of the
  shell and each new membrane is formed large and extensible so as
  to allow without splitting of some increase in the diameter of
  the shell The opercular membrane at the summit of the shell in
  Tubicinella is folded in concentric lines and so deeply that
  the basal edges of the opercular valves are generally hidden this
  folding arises partly from each last deposited and innermost membrane
  being originally formed slightly folded but chiefly from the rapid
  downward growth of the shell and the consequent downward movement of
  the whole animals body together with the opercular valves to which
  the body is attached and this necessarily tends to wrinkle and fold
  the opercular membrane Owing to the opercular membrane extending far
  down inside the shell and being firmly attached to the sheath as
  the upper part of the shell breaks away and disintegrates which we
  shall presently see is constantly taking place small particles of
  shell are left adherent to the circumferential and folded parts of
  the opercular membrane and this at first much perplexed me

  Muscles of the Sack these extend down almost to the base of the
  shell but in the lower part they spread out and become thin and very
  irregular not even corresponding on the opposite sides of the body
  The fasci in the upper part show very distinct transverse stri but
  lower down these become either obscure or entirely deficient In all
  these characters the muscles of Tubicinella and Coronula resemble
  each other The rostral depressor muscles of the scuta consist each
  of four small bundles of fasci the lateral depressores run not
  quite straight down but in a curved course towards the carinal end
  of the sack the tergal depressores are proportionally smaller than
  in ordinary sessile cirripedes but they project and form two crests
  with some fasci between them which support the Branchi The
  membrane lining the sack I may here mention is unusually strong

  BranchiThese are enormously developed the two together
  covering two thirds of the area of the sack Each consists of two
  folds both deeply plicated They are attached longitudinally to
  the two crests including and formed by the muscles running from
  the terga to near the basis of the shell The branchi are likewise
  attached transversely to the sack under the basal margins of the
  terga

     These have been described by Professor Owen in the second
    volume of the Descriptive Catalogue of the Museum of the Royal
    College of Surgeons

  MouthThe labrum is very finely hirsute without teeth the palpi
  have a short row of moderately long spines along their exterior
  basal margins The mandibles have four rather narrow sharp teeth
  which excepting the first have double points between the second
  and third and again between the third and fourth teeth there is a
  single small intermediate tooth the inferior angle is irregularly
  pectinated The maxill are small there is a small notch beneath the
  two upper great spines and a second notch near the inferior angle
  Between the outer maxill there is a squaretopped mentum Hence we
  see that the mouth in all its few peculiarities resembles that of
  Coronula

  CirriThese are short with short and broad segments protuberant
  in front The pedicel of the first cirrus is very broad and
  exteriorly clothed with fine hairs its rami are slightly unequal
  in length The second and third cirri are very short The three
  posterior pairs are remarkable from the pairs of main spines being
  placed so close one under the other and in an oblique direction
  that at first they appear to form a single crowded transverse row
  the dorsal tufts are rather large

  BodyThe body is remarkable from its nearly vertical position
  and from the much elongated pyramidal form of the prosoma extending
  down nearly to the bottom of the sack The membrane investing the
  prosoma presents a few circular folds falsely appearing like
  articulations The sophagus enters the stomach rather obliquely
  With respect to the generative system I have only to remark that
  the vesicul seminales are of great length and convoluted to a
  remarkable degree The ovarian cca form a thick layer at the
  bottom of the sack they do not appear to extend up the shell round
  the sack The only other point which I shall here mention is that
  beneath the basal articulation of the first cirrus there is a
  longitudinal swelling ending in a freely projecting point  of
  an inch in length at first I thought that we here had a rudiment
  of a filamentary appendage like those found in several Lepadid
  but closer examination showed an orifice at the apex leading into
  the acoustic meatus in which the singular wrinkled heartshaped
  acoustic vesicle mentioned in the Introduction hangs suspended
  Alongside the freely depending point with an orifice at its end
  there is a smaller upward projecting point without any orifice but
  hollow within and lined by corium I believe it opens internally into
  the acoustic meatus

  Attachment and general Growth of ShellAll the specimens which
  I have seen have been attached in groups They are buried up to
  the level of the operculum in the whales skin and their summits
  I suspect lie even beneath the general surface of the body of
  the whale It is certain that the shells grow much at their basal
  ends As in the case of Coronula the flat membranous basis does
  not actually penetrate the skin but the general pressure of the
  whole group of shells seems to push inwards the skin of the whale
  and directly beneath each shell the formation of new epidermis
  is apparently checked Between the shells however though close
  together the epidermis continues to be formed and is pushed upwards
  between them in the same manner as it is forced into the flattened
  cavities on the under side of the shell of Coronula

  The manner in which a fullgrown shell assumes its ordinary shape
  at first appears very perplexing it has to change from a
  cylinder at first probably not much above the th of an inch in
  diameter to a cylinder nearly one inch in diameter and this is
  not effected by the growth of the radii for the radii never reach
  the basis and the basis of course has to increase in diameter
  like the rest of the cylindrical shell The radii serve only to
  keep the summit of the shell wider than the basis which is the
  natural shape of this species and in largesized specimens this
  purpose is sometimes aided by the parietes during their downward
  growth decreasing slightly in width In ordinary nearly fullsized
  specimens the parietes are of the same width at the top and bottom
  but in some largesized specimens as just stated they even become
  narrower towards the bottom as they grow only at the bottom one
  does not at first see how they can ever increase in width or how
  the older shells can have acquired their present diameter But an
  examination of young specimens from  to  of an inch in diameter
  at once serves to show how the shell attains its full size and shape
  for here the parietes are all found to increase downwards sensibly
  in width though at a much slower ratio than in other sessile
  cirripedes in larger but not fullgrown specimens a similar
  increase can by care be detected hence by longcontinued growth at
  the base of the shell with the removal of the upper part a young
  Tubicinella of small diameter will be converted into an old one of
  large diameter retaining during all the time its subcylindrical
  form with its summit rather broader than its base With respect
  to the removal of the upper part of the shell this seems almost
  constantly going on for the summit of every specimen invariably had
  a freshly broken aspect The peculiar structure of the sheath which
  is the strongest part of the shell namely its division into oblique
  layers separable by a slight force doubtless is subservient to the
  repeated breakage of the summit In some species of Tetraclita and
  of Balanus gradual disintegration of the upper part of the shell is
  a necessary element in the growth of the animal in order that the
  orifice may increase in size and here we have mechanical breakage
  equally necessary

     I am indebted to Dr J E Gray for calling my attention to
    this subject and explaining to me several points

  Some curious results follow from the peculiar growth of Tubicinella
  just described At Plate  fig  b we have a careful drawing of
  a lateral compartment together with its radius which latter does
  not here concern us taken from a shell  of an inch in diameter
  The two protracted dotted lines show the form which this compartment
  would have assumed if it had continued growing downwards at the
  same rate of increase in width as hitherto But the increase in
  width always seems to become less and less as the shell grows older
  hence the dotted lines representing the wall after longcontinued
  growth ought to have been drawn diverging or widening still more
  slowly than they do The lateral compartment in fig  a is the
  exact size of the compartment of a large specimen nearly one inch in
  diameter in this specimen the parietes far from increasing in width
  downwards had commenced as is represented decreasing Compartments
  of all intermediate sizes between those figured at  a and  b
  can easily be shown in different specimens From these facts we may
  safely infer that if the whole growth of the compartment  a had
  been preserved instead of its upper end having been continually
  chipped away it would have had even a more tapering form than that
  represented by the whole and dotted lines in the two figures and
  would have exceeded six inches in length this of course being also
  the length of the whole shell The young Tubicinella of which 
  b is a compartment was imbedded in the whales skin nearly up to
  the level of its operculum if it had lived it would no doubt have
  grown to the length just specified viz above six inches but as
  all the growth is at the lower end the bottom of the shell it might
  be thought would necessarily have become buried in the whales skin
  to this same depth and the summit of the shell on this same view
  would have been buried to a depth by as much less as the height or
  length of the old shell itself namely by about one inch and a half
  less than the six inches As far as I can judge from an examination
  of several large groups of fullgrown specimens preserved in their
  imbedded condition the summits of the shells seem always to lie a
  little beneath the surrounding level of the whales skin but not
  nearly to the extent here just inferred Nor can I believe that the
  epidermis of the whale had ceased being formed under these specimens
  whilst it had gone on being formed all round them to the thickness
  of between four and five inches and that it had subsequently
  disintegrated to this same thicknesswhich processes would account
  for the summit of the shell being still on nearly a level with the
  surface of the whale The view which seems to me most probable is
  that the rapid downward growth of the shell besides indenting the
  whales skin at the same time slowly pushes the whole shell out
  of the skin and thus continually exposes the summit to the wear
  and breakage which seems to be necessary for its existence On this
  view the very peculiar form of Tubicinella which is retained during
  life namely the slightly greater width at top than at bottom
  is beautifully explained viz for the sake of facilitating the
  protrusion of the shell for the ordinary conical shape of sessile
  cirripedes with the apex upwards would have rendered the pushing
  out of an imbedded shell almost impossible on the other hand we can
  see that the likewise very peculiar concentric prominent belts may
  be necessary to prevent too easy protrusion

  Fossil SpeciesI do not believe that this genus has hitherto
  been found fossil The Tubicinella maxima of Ch Morren said to
  have been found see Bronn Index Palontologicus in the chalk of
  Belgium I have good reason to believe does not really belong to this
  genus

  Steenstrup


This Cirripede in appearance the most anomalous of its family has
affinities distinctly pronounced Four years ago the Rev R T
Lowe sent me some specimens which he had obtained from a porpoise
between Madeira and England and I named them in MS Siphonicella
from their relationship to Tubicinellaa fact which I mention only
because Sir C Lyell has alluded to this genus under the above name
without any description in his anniversary address to the Geological
Society as have I in my volume p  on the Lepadid Since that
time Professor Steenstrup has described and named the genus fully
recognising its place and affinities and has most kindly sent me a
magnificent group of specimens

This genus singularly resembles in general appearance some of
the pedunculated Cirripedes so much so that in the specimens sent
me by Mr Lowe in which the almost rudimentary shell was from
disintegration and its deep imbedment not plainly visible I did not
in the least doubt that I was examining a new genus of Lepadid I may
mention as a proof how truly all the parts and organs are correlated
in Cirripedes that I was at first in despair when I found a species
to all appearance pedunculated with its labrum not bullate its palpi
of large size its third pair of cirri totally unlike the fourth and
succeeding pairs and with only a single layer of muscles round the
peduncle but when in addition I found that there were branchi
and that these were double I felt convinced that I was dissecting a
disguised sessile cirripede and that its true place was near Coronula
soon I found the imbedded and almost rudimentary shell of which a
mere fragment would equally well have declared the true position and
relationship of the whole animal Though Xenobalanus in external
aspect is so completely masked yet in its habits namely in living
attached on Cetaceans as in its essential structure it displays its
real affinities In the course of the following description it will
be seen that in the shell the affinity is almost equally close to
Coronula and Platylepas but that considering the whole animal the
affinity is somewhat closer to Tubicinella Xenobalanus may indeed
be described as a Tubicinella without opercular valveswith the
opercular membrane thickened down to the basisand with the shell
excepting the few lastformed basal zones of growth almost wholly
removed by the breakage of its upper end this remnant of a shell
however presenting some strong points of resemblance to Coronula

  General AppearanceThe shell is in an almost rudimentary
  condition and appears like a small white irregular star imbedded up
  to its top in the skin of the porpoise Out of this thin starshaped
  shell a cylindrical flexible peduncleformed body springs which
  forms the main part of the animal it is narrow where coming out of
  the central cavity of the star but soon acquires its full diameter
  at the upper end it has a reflexed hood and hence is broader
  and this has the appearance of forming a capitulum like that of
  a pedunculated Cirripede This pseudocapitulum is formed by a
  membranous reflexed collar or hood which is very narrow at the lower
  end of the orifice close under the mouth and becomes wider and
  wider towards the upper and carinal or posterior end of the orifice
  hence the lower reflexed edge of the hood is only slightly oblique or
  even nearly transverse The orifice leading into the sack is large
  and nearly in the same straight line with the peduncle it is a
  little hollowed out in the middle at the upper end and on each side
  of this medial hollow there is a small rounded projection or horn
  not perforated but hollow as may be seen by turning up the hood and
  looking at its under side These two little horns curiously bring to
  mind the earlike appendages in Conchoderma aurita Otion but
  these latter are perforated open into the sack and point outwards
  The peduncleformed body answers as we shall presently see to the
  main part of the shell in Tubicinella and the hood as it would
  appear to the lips of the sackaperture which project between its
  scuta and terga of these valves there is not here a trace The
  whole surface is smooth and is formed by rather thin membrane of
  an orange colour but from the colour of the underlying corium the
  whole appears of a dark chocolate red the reflexed hood being rather
  lighter coloured It is singular how closely the colour resembles
  that of some dark varieties of the abovementioned Conchoderma
  aurita and likewise of Anelasma squalicola both pedunculated
  Cirripedes having oceanic habits and destitute to a remarkable
  degree like Xenobalanus of shelly valves

  The largest specimen which I have seen was very nearly two inches in
  length in this specimen the starshaped shell measured from extreme
  point to point nearly a quarter of an inch in diameter but the
  internal cavity only about one eighth of an inch This latter measure
  gives also the diameter of the peduncle where coming out of the
  shell the diameter just beneath the hood was in this same specimen
  rather more than a quarter of an inch and therefore greater than the
  diameter of the points of the shell The depth of the shell from the
  upper rim to the basal membrane in one specimen which I measured
  was only one twentieth of an inch and this specimen had its
  pseudopeduncle one inch and three quarters in length consequently
  thirtyfive times as long as the shell was deep

  Structure of ShellThe almost rudimentary shell fig 
  b consists of a small thin sixrayed disc formed of six
  compartments each of which instead of being outwardly convex as
  in ordinary Cirripedes is deeply bowed inwards The narrow sutures
  s s separating the six compartments run along the middle of
  the six rays each ray being composed of the bowed ends of the
  walls of the adjoining compartments The rays are a little curved
  towards the carinal end of the shell It is remarkable that the
  rostrum is smaller and less deeply folded inwards than the other
  compartments and the lateral compartments are a little smaller
  than the carinolateral compartments which is exactly the reverse
  of what is usually the case Only about four zones of growth have
  been preserved in any specimen and consequently the shell is very
  nearly of the same diameter at the top and bottom for the upper end
  of the shell is rapidly removed as in Tubicinella by the scaling
  off of the upper rims of the sheath and by the disintegration of
  the walls The zones of growth are commonly not piled exactly over
  each other but rather obliquely as represented in fig  b Each
  zone projects forming a prominent sharp toothed ridge round the
  shell In Coronula Pl  fig  and its allies the outer lamina
  of the wall is formed by the union a little above the basal margin
  of ledges running along the sides of the longitudinal septa In
  Xenobalanus Pl  fig  c similar ledges are less perfectly
  joined and apertures seem always to be left in transverse rows
  under the transverse toothed ridges which latter are best seen
  in fig  b The apertures of course are covered by membrane
  The transverse ridges are surmounted by knobs arising from the
  longitudinal septa and the knobs themselves are capped by other
  little heads which are not represented in the drawing Owing to
  these projections and to the prominence of the transverse ridges
  and of the longitudinal septa the external membrane is attached so
  firmly to the shell that even with the aid of caustic potash it can
  hardly be separated

  The internal cavity of the shell is small it approaches a hexagon
  in shape with the rostral side very short and the lateral sides
  curved inwards It is lined by a rather thick sheath which descends
  very near to the basal membrane the sheath is divided into very
  distinct successive convex zones of growth The external membrane
  of the pseudopeduncle is attached with remarkable strength to
  these riblike zones of the sheath The al a in fig  b are
  represented by mere angular shoulders received into very slight
  notches and placed at the inner ends or entrances of the double
  walls or rays as I have called them With respect to the radii they
  also are in an extremely rudimentary condition but a thin layer of
  shell apparently continuous and homologous with the sheath extends
  from the sheath along both sides of each ray and on the rostral side
  whence the radius ought to arise about halfway from the end of
  the ray gives rise to a projection or ridge d in fig  b
  which runs from the top to the base of the shallow shell From this
  longitudinal ridge septa parallel to the basis extend to nearly
  the extremity of the ray or double wall These represent the radii
  but they never grow so as to increase the diameter of the shell
  These radii evidently correspond to the additional or pseudoradii
  in Coronula which in that genus lie between the parallel as here
  and folded parietes Of the true radius having the same thickness
  as the paries I here saw only traces in an internal very slight
  longitudinal ridge running up the shell close to the outer extremity
  of each ray or double wall

  The membranous Basis is united all round to a rather wide flap of
  membrane which is inflected from the outer surface of the shell The
  cementglands appear to be mere enlargements of the cementtrunks
  which latter extend in two nearly straight and parallel lines From
  each gland two cementducts proceed one of which runs parallel to
  the cementtrunk

  The pseudopeduncle forming the main part of the animal has as far
  as external appearance is concerned been sufficiently described
  The part forming the hood apparently answers to the protuberant lips
  of the operculum and the lower part to the subcylindrical shell of
  Tubicinella both shell and peduncle in the two genera being wider
  at top than at bottom If in imagination we chip away an action
  always in progress the whole upper part of the shell of Tubicinella
  leaving only two or three zones of growth at the base we shall
  convert it into a Xenobalanus with every internal part and organ
  occupying the same relative position for it should be borne in mind
  that the shell of Tubicinella is lined close down to the basis by
  the opercular membrane and this is strictly comparable with the
  outer membrane of the pseudopeduncle of Xenobalanus The body as
  in Tubicinella is attached in a vertical position with the longer
  axis of the thorax and of the much elongated prosoma extending in
  the direction of the longitudinal axis of the pseudopeduncle The
  point of attachment of the body to the lower part of the hood is
  much elongated but presents the usual muscles running to near the
  base of the labrum and embracing the prosoma The adductor scutorum
  muscle is well developed and is placed close beneath the mouth
  where the collar or hood commences folding over hence no doubt the
  lower end of the large and long orifice into the sack can be closed
  by the adductor but the upper end probably can only be blocked up
  by the outer surfaces of the curled cirri The scuta I may add
  if such had existed would certainly have covered the point where
  the adductor muscle is attached to the exterior membrane The sack
  extends down to within the almost rudimentary shell the tunic lining
  it is unusually strong indeed in the reflexed hoodlike portion
  it is as strong as the properly external membrane The latter seems
  to be moulted in large strips and not in a single piece like the
  opercular membrane in Balanus just above the shell fragments of
  three or four of these outer coats are retained by their very firm
  attachment to the sheath The two layers of corium lining the outer
  membrane of the pseudopeduncle and the inner tunic of the sack
  instead of being as usual united almost continuously together
  stand some little way apart and are connected by longitudinal septa
  hence in a transverse section especially of the lower part the
  sack is surrounded by an irregular ring of square tubes of corium
  The muscles surrounding the sack and imbedded in the inner fold of
  corium are very thinly spread out they branch and even sometimes
  cross each other they are more numerous at the carinal and rostral
  ends but certainly cannot be said to form six or five bundles as
  in all other sessile cirripedes Some of the fasci extend down to
  the very basis and some up to the summit to near the two little
  hornlike projections I could not perceive any transverse stri on
  these muscles Altogether they are very weak and cannot have much
  power in moving the whole pedunclelike body

  BranchiThese are largely developed they are attached to two
  approximate longitudinal fleshy crests which extend more than
  halfway down the sack along the carinal margin Each branchia is
  double the two folds being united where attached in a transverse
  line across the sack on a level with the attachment of the body
  The inner fold is much smaller than the outer not extending half so
  far down the sack and not extending so far transversely it is also
  hardly at all plicated The larger and plicated fold extends down
  considerably below the lower end of the prosoma and altogether fully
  equals one third of the entire length of the animal measured from
  the shell to the summit of the orifice Both folds are formed of very
  delicate membrane

  MouthLabrum unusually prominent as measured from its basal
  margin to the crest which is but slightly notched hairy and
  without teeth Palpi broad heartshaped clothed on their inner
  sides by a thick brush of spines which here as on the other
  gnathites and cirri are almost all doubly serrated On the outer
  margin of the palpi there are a few longer spines Mandibles villose
  with five teeth of which the fifth is very small and of irregular
  shape the inferior angle is broad and pectinated There are no
  intermediate teeth between the second third and fourth teeth as
  in the three foregoing genera Had I not known that the lower main
  mandibular teeth were always laterally double in the Balanin and
  had I not observed how obscure this structure was in Coronula and
  Tubicinella I should have overlooked the merest vestiges of double
  teeth in the present genus indeed in some specimens the teeth
  seemed to be absolutely single The maxill are villose their edge
  exhibits a trace of being notched under the two great upper spines
  The outer maxill are bilobed but not very plainly between these
  organs there is no little prominent mentum as in the three previous
  genera

  CirriThe cirri are short particularly the three anterior pairs
  The segments in all are singular from being so much compressed so
  short and of such great breadth they are protuberant in front
  In the second and third cirri the broad lateral faces of the
  segments with the exception of the posterior face of the posterior
  ramus are almost bare of spines In the three posterior pairs of
  cirri Pl  fig  the segments are protuberant in front and
  support three pairs of short thick spines with an intermediate tuft
  the dorsal tufts are unusually small their pedicels are remarkable
  from the upper segment and the upper part of the lower segment
  being produced into a rounded protuberance dotted with spines I
  have met with a similar structure only in Scalpellum vulgare In
  the third pair fig  there is only a trace of this structure and
  in the second pair the anterior margin of the pedicel is straight
  and clothed with three tufts of bristles The pedicel of the first
  cirrus is very broad and clasps the mouth

  The cirri and mouth are dark chocolate red like the outside of the
  animal and the upper part of the sack The thorax is redder and
  paler The four posterior articulations of the thorax are straight
  and transverse the next segment or that corresponding with the
  second pair of cirri is slightly inflected in the usual way
  towards the prosoma The prosoma is pale coloured extraordinarily
  elongated and bluntly pointed it extends down see the dotted
  outline in Pl  fig  a about one third of the length of the
  whole animal The orifice leading into the acoustic sack forms a
  freely depending little point beneath the basal articulation of the
  first cirrus The stomach in the uppermost part is deeply and closely
  plaited longitudinally but has no cca it runs down externally
  coated as usual by the testes to the lower point of the prosoma
  and is then doubled back on itself so that it is very long

  Generative SystemThe probosciformed penis is short and thick
  and covered with very minute tufts of bristles there is no
  knifeedged projection at its dorsal base The vesicul seminales are
  much convoluted and of great length The ovarian tubes form a small
  sheet within the rudimentary shell in the normal position over
  the basal membrane and likewise higher up between the two folds of
  corium surrounding the pseudopeduncle they do not however appear
  to occur round the lower part of the peduncle they extend highest
  on the rostral and carinal sides and lowest on the two lateral
  faces The ova are wonderfully numerous they are ths of an
  inch in length they form instead of two thin lamell two almost
  cylindrical packets which are held together by most feeble membrane
  Each packet in the upper part lies between the two folds of the
  branchi and in the lower part is embraced only by the larger outer
  fold The two packets of eggs sometimes cohere together at their
  lower ends

  ImbedmentThe shell is imbedded up to its summit but the shell
  is very shallow The imbedment seems due either to the compression
  of the epidermis of the porpoise or to its formation beneath the
  shell having been checked the outline of the true skin under the
  darkcoloured epidermis is not in the least affected The epidermis
  fills up the baylike spaces formed by the inwardly folded walls and
  firmly adheres to them

  AffinitiesThis genus presents very varied affinities to
  Tubicinella Coronula and Platylepas To the latter it is more
  especially allied in the compartments being singly folded inwards
  though the sides of the folds are not here closely pressed together
  as in Platylepas in both these genera the fold is less deep in the
  rostrum of which fact in Platylepas the final cause is evident
  but here there seems no cause excepting the simple one of affinity
  Xenobalanus is further allied to Platylepas in the lesser size of
  the inner fold of each branchia compared with the outer and in
  the structure of the cementglands and to a certain extent in that
  of the sheath To Coronula the special alliance is shown by the
  remarkable character of the pseudoradii lying between the parallel
  and adjoining walls and in the general character of the cirri in
  Coronula we have the terga sometimes quite aborted and the scuta
  of small size thus exhibiting a tendency to the entire absence of
  opercular valves so remarkable in Xenobalanus To Tubicinella the
  alliance is still more plainly shown in the external shape of the
  whole animal wider at top than at bottomin the opercular membrane
  descending almost to the very basein the relative positions of the
  different parts and organsin the upper end of the shell continually
  scaling offin the prominence of the transverse external ridgesin
  the sheath being divided into successive zones of growth and being
  prolonged nearly to the basal membraneand in the edges of the al
  being smooth Internally the resemblance is also plainly shown
  in the strength of the internal tunic of the sackin the branchi
  springing from two approximate fleshy crestsin the freely depending
  acoustic orificesin the form of the thorax and prosomaand
  consequently of the alimentary canal

Seeing the state of the almost rudimentary shell it is not difficult
to imagine its total disappearance Thinking of this it occurred
to me to doubt for a few minutes whether Anelasma described in my
volume on the Lepadid which presents many points of resemblance with
Xenobalanusviz in colour in the strength of the internal membrane
of the sack in the size of the orifice with its thin membranous
margin in the entire absence of opercular valves and in epizoic
habitsmight not in truth be a sessile cirripede in an extremely
altered condition for the cirri of Anelasma are in so rudimentary a
state and the mouth in so modified a condition that the internal
characters by which pedunculated cirripedes can be distinguished from
the Balanin though not from the Chthamalin are almost lost But
if Anelasma had belonged to either of the two subfamilies of the
Balanid the sack would have penetrated almost to the bottom of the
peduncle there would have been only a single layer of longitudinal
muscles round the peduncle and there would not have existed ovigerous
frna I believe that Anelasma and Xenobalanus are only analogically
connected being no more related together by true affinity than any
other two genera in the Lepadid and Balanid




SubFamilyCHTHAMALIN

Shell with the rostrum having al but without radii rostrolateral
compartments without al on either side parietes not porose

Mouth with the labrum bullate palpi hardly touching each other third
pair of cirri with the segments resembling those of the fourth pair


The shell in this subfamily consists of four six or eight
compartments with the addition in Catophragmus of several whorls
of supplemental compartments or scales like those forming the lower
part of the capitulum in Pollicipes The rostrum has al and no
radii in shape and size it resembles the carina The rostrolateral
compartments are destitute of al in all cases they overlap the
adjoining compartments and have radii when such are developed on
both sides In the genus Pachylasma however the shell must be
looked to very young in order to detect this normal structure for
soon the true rostrum and rostrolateral compartments become blended
together making a compound rostrum destitute as in the Balanin
of al but furnished with radii The parietes are never porose nor
furnished with regular symmetrical ribs representing the longitudinal
parietal septa on their inner surfaces sometimes however on the
basal internal edges there are some irregular depending points In
conformity with the simplicity of the parietes the Radii which are
seldom much developed have likewise a simple structure and often are
merely formed by the simple lateral growth of the parietes The scuta
and terga are articulated together more deeply than is usual in the
Balanin and the terga never have a long spur

Looking to the animals body The Labrum is always swollen and
bullate and though hollowed out is never notched in the middle The
Palpi are rather small and have not their tips nearly touching each
other The mandibles generally have their lower main teeth laterally
single though sometimes they are double the inferior angle is always
pectinated The maxill are always notched under the upper pair
of great spines Of the Cirri the third pair much more closely
resembles in external structure and powers of movement the fourth
than the second pair though sometimes a few of the basal segments
especially on the anterior ramus are thickly covered with bristles as
on the segments of the second pair In three species belonging to two
genera there are caudal appendages resembling those generally present
amongst the Lepadid but never found in the Balanin The Branchi
are generally smaller than in the Balanin and are sometimes quite
rudimentary

In the introductory description p  and  of the Family
Balanid I have already discussed the relations of the Chthamalin to
the Balanin and of the several genera to each other so that I need
not here reenter on the subject

This the typical genus is the largest and widest distributed group of
the subfamily Chthamalin The founder of the genus apparently did not
perceive its essential character Savigny however as is evident from
the excellent figure in the great work on gypt perfectly understood
the difference between Chthamalus and Balanus I was first indebted
to Dr J E Gray for explaining to me this difference but the only
published account which I have met with is in a paper by the Rev R T
Lowe in which he states on the authority of Mr Clark of Bath
that in Chthamalus the anterior compartment or rostrum has al like
the posterior compartment or carina the anterior or rostrolateral
compartments being destitute of al These characters being exactly
reversed in Balanus as I have already explained p  under the
subfamily of Balanin

     Zoological Journal vol  p  

The shell owing apparently to its containing much animal matter is
particularly subject to disintegration and when thus much affected it
is quite impossible to distinguish the species by external characters
It is in fact best to cast on one side external appearance though
when the shells happen to be well preserved each species has its own
peculiar aspect We have in this genus smooth and plicated cylindrical
and depressed varieties of most of the species The development of the
radii is very apt to vary and even the compartments often become so
completely united and calcified together that the sutures are almost
or quite obliterated A more serious difficulty in discriminating
the species arises from the fact of the opercular valves not only
varying extremely in external appearance in consequence of the greater
or less disintegration of their apices and consequent exposure of
their articular ridges and furrows compare fig  a  b  c
in Pl  but from their truly varying in outline with the varying
shape of the shell this latter circumstance is probably due to the
opercular membrane which unites the valves to the shell being very
narrow and in consequence differences in the shape of the shell
affect the opercular valves in a manner and to a degree to which the
Balanin are not subject compare fig  e  f  h in Pl 
The scuta on the other hand differ to an unusually slight degree in
the different species In the common Chthamalus stellatus which
abounds on the southern British shores the whole external aspect
of the shell is often so completely masked owing to its varying
shape its obliterated sutures its deeply disintegrated and punctured
surface and by the corroded condition of its opercular valves that
I have found this species in the collections of naturalists who have
attended to cirripedes arranged actually on the same tablet mingled
with specimens of Balanus balanoides I have myself several times
found it less troublesome to discriminate these two genera by the
included animals body than by the shell though the latter when
well preserved and developed possesses such obviously wellmarked
characters the same thing has occurred to me with some of the other
species

     It will be found ultimately to save time and trouble to soak
    for half an hour in hot caustic potash a specimen out of each
    group of shells to be examined and then well wash and brush the
    separated valves and compartments this process has been followed
    by me with all the species here to be described

General AppearanceThe shell is generally depressed but sometimes
when growing in groups cylindrical The surface is either smooth or
longitudinally folded and as already stated very apt to be deeply
disintegrated The radii when developed are narrow with their
summits oblique and rounded but they are often quite absent and
sometimes even the sutures are almost obliterated The rostrum and
carina are of the same shape and size and the two lateral compartments
on each side are of nearly equal breadths The orifice is generally
subrhomboidal being widest towards the carinal instead of towards
the rostral end as is usual in Balanus but in Chthamalus fissus
the orifice is narrow and elongated The opercular valves have their
apices generally disintegrated and worn away and are then seen to be
deeply locked together The colour of the shell is dirty white or dull
purplishred or brown but in C intertextus rich violetpurple The
species are small not often exceeding half an inch in basal diameter
with the exception of C Hembeli of which I have seen a specimen two
and three quarters of an inch in diameter

ScutaThese present no particular character excepting in most
cases the large development of the articular ridge and sometimes the
presence of a furrow above the articular ridge of which only traces
can rarely be detected in Balanus hence in these cases as in C
Hembeli Pl  fig  a  c and scabrosus Pl  fig 
a  c the line of articulation between the scutum and tergum
is more complicated than is usual There is generally a slight pit
sometimes even furnished with small crests for the lateral scutal
depressor muscle in C scabrosus fig  d q a part of this
muscle is attached to a small pit at the basiscutal corner of the
terguma fact of which I have observed no instance in any other
genus In C intertextus the terga and scuta are calcified together
without even a suture being visible on their internal faces In C
Hembeli the valve is externally marked by a few longitudinal furrows

The Terga like the scuta have a prominent articular ridge and deep
furrow In many specimens of C stellatus and in C scabrosus
the valve is narrow in C fissus it is triangular and nearly
equilateral The crests for the depressores muscles are well developed
in C scabrosus Pl  fig  d p these crests are united
into a plate which together with the outer lamina of the valve forms
a deep narrow pit in C Hembeli the crests are furnished with small
subcrests The opercular membrane is narrow it is sometimes furnished
with a few minute spines

Structure of ParietesThe parietes are solid and composed of
successive layers of shell the inner surface varies in condition
in the same species being either smooth or marked with branching
impressed lines or mamillated or often irregularly punctured for the
entrance of tubuli Owing to these tubuli the walls when externally
disintegrated often become punctured In certain depressed varieties
of both C stellatus and scabrosus the walls are supported by
irregular depending columns placed along either one side or both sides
of the sutures In C intertextus we have the remarkable character of
the wall of the shell growing I presume after a certain age almost
rectangularly inwards thus forming a rather wide flat calcareous rim
round the central basal membrane In C Hembeli the internal basal
edges of the parietes in one moderately young specimen were rugged
with irregular points but presented no other remarkable appearance
but in five old and very large specimens the whole basis was
calcareous being absolutely continuous with the inner lamina of the
parietes showing that the latter had grown flatly inwards all round
and had then become confluent in the middle so that there was no
longer any basal membrane excepting no doubt that which had existed
in the younger stage and which would be preserved in a functionless
condition between the surface of attachment and the inflected parietes

When an opercular valve or compartment is dissolved in acid layers of
tissue are left and these are seen to be penetrated by tubuli which
enter at the punctures before mentioned on the inside of the shell
these tubuli often stand in groups of three or four together they
are about th of an inch in diameter Besides these irregularly
scattered tubuli there are in the opercular valves of C antennatus
innumerable smaller parallel tubuli running to the external investing
membrane

Structure of the Radii and AlThe radii when developed are
always rather narrow Their recipient furrows are generally nearly as
broad as the radii themselves Their edges are either quite smooth as
in C antennatus or very finely crenated or as in C dentatus
and Hembeli Pl  fig  a  a so strongly crenated as to
make the suture both externally and internally toothed in these
two species the radii are ribbed in transverse lines parallel to
the basis each rib corresponding with one of the projecting and
interlocking teeth on the sutures In C intertextus and much less
plainly in most specimens of C scabrosus Pl  fig  a 
a we have a structure in appearance very different for the radii
here consist of several very oblique plates i e nearly parallel
to the parietes on both sides of the sutures which are interfolded or
locked together I believe that this structure is a mere modification
of that in C dentatus and Hembeli the transverse ridges on the
radii of those species being here developed into oblique plates We
shall hereafter meet with a similar structure in the genus Verruca
to which genus until meeting with these two species of Chthamalus I
had thought that the interfolding sutures had been confined The al
have their edges generally finely crenated during diametric growth
when such takes place they are rarely added to above the level
of the opercular membrane and hence their summits are oblique in
C intertextus however the al are laterally added to above the
opercular membrane and their recipient furrows are likewise added to
of which fact I have seen no other distinct instance in any genus
hence on both sides of the sutures in the sheath of this species the
lines of growth are upturned In some much disintegrated specimens
both of C stellatus var depressus and of C antennatus the
radii have been corroded away and the diametric growth is effected
exclusively by the growth of the al which are moreover much exposed
and rendered conspicuous The sheath descends a moderate distance down
the shell When a shell is boiled in potash the sutures excepting
when abnormally calcified together as very often happens with some
species always fall apart showing that the union is simply by
animalised matter

BasisThe basis is always membranous but we have seen in C
intertextus that the walls form a flat ledge all round the base
and that in old specimens of C Hembeli they grow so far inwards
and become so completely confluent that they might most easily be
mistaken for a true calcareous basis I may add that in one elongated
specimen of C stellatus from La Plata the walls had likewise
grown rectangularly inwards forming a flat base and had then turned
upwards in the middle forming a medial crest with the edges not quite
calcified together The true basal membrane is very obscurely divided
into concentric slips I observed in several species attached to the
lower surface an excessively fine network quadrangular or hexagonal
of yellow vessels which seemed insensibly to pass into the sheets
discs and globules of cement by which the membranous basis adheres to
the supporting surface I saw in C antennatus numerous irregular
bifurcating and inosculating cementducts of unequal diameter often
crossing each other and sending off branches ending in points the
older ducts instead of being solidly filled up with cement were only
divided by septa I did not succeed in any species in discovering the
cementglands

MouthThe labrum is slightly bullate with the middle portion
depressed but not forming a notch in some species it is hairy and
in some pectinated with short spines The palpi are of moderate size
The mandibles have from three to five main teeth the number sometimes
varying even in the same species the lower teeth are either plainly
double laterally or very obscurely double or to all appearance
quite single a rather large lower portion of the mandible is finely
pectinated The maxill are always notched under the two or three large
upper spines the notch bears some fine spines beneath the notch there
are some large spines and at the inferior angle some smaller ones

CirriThe first and second pairs are always very short compared
with the four posterior pairs The rami of the first pair are slightly
unequal The third pair in length and arrangement of the spines very
closely resembles the three posterior pairs in C intertextus
however the few basal segments chiefly on the anterior ramus are
thickly clothed with bristles like the segments of the second cirrus
In C antennatus Pl  fig  the anterior ramus of this same
third pair is usually one single specimen being excepted much
elongated having at least twice as many segments as the posterior
ramus but the number is variable and these segments either all
or only the upper ones instead of having their spines regularly
arranged in pairs in a double row are surmounted each by a circle of
spines I suspect that these elongated rami of the third cirrus act
as antenn It can hardly be an accidental coincidence that certain
genera as Lysmata and Pandalus amongst the Macrourous Crustaceans
have the same leg homologically the second thoracic limb elongated
and antenniformed Certain varieties of C stellatus and cirratus
also have the anterior ramus of this same third cirrus considerably
elongated We are thus reminded of the remarkable variability in the
numbers of the segments and in the arrangement of their spines in the
cirri of Tetraclita porosa in that species however it was chiefly
the terminal segments of the posterior ramus of the third cirrus
which were so highly variable The three posterior pairs of cirri in
Chthamalus support from three to five pairs of main spines on each
segment the number often varying in the same species with some minute
intermediate bristles The dorsal surfaces of these segments in some
of the species are serrated in an upward direction

Body cThe body does not present any particular character in
C scabrosus there is a slight ridge running from the base of the
first cirrus towards the adductor scutorum muscle this ridge is
clothed with a few hairs there are also some hairs at the carinal
end of the sack In C dentatus also there are hairs on the outer
tunic of the prosoma In two species which I opened there were no
cca to the stomach The ova vary in length from  to th of
an inch in length they are packed in two lamell lying on each side
of the animals body The larva just escaped out of the egg in C
stellatus scabrosus and dentatus had a large probosciformed
mouth

BranchiThese present a very singular amount of difference within
the limits of the same genus In C stellatus and antennatus we
have a simple fillet tapering a little barely plicated and about
half or more than half as long as the sack in C scabrosus the
branchi are entirely aborted or are perhaps represented by the slight
hairy ridge at the carinal end of the sack in C dentatus on the
other hand each branchia consists of two large folds barely plicated
almost covering the whole side of the sack so that here the branchi
are developed to an unusual degree more than in Balanus and as in
Coronula and its allies in the same manner as in these latter genera
the outer fold is considerably larger than the inner fold

AffinitiesC intertextus is the most distinct species of the
genus as shown by the peculiar radii and al by the scuta and terga
being calcified together by the character of the third pair of cirri
and by the inflected parietes forming a ledge round the membranous
basis but in this latter respect C intertextus resembles C
Hembeli C Hembeli in its serrated radii is closely related to
C dentatus and this latter species differs in the structure of
its radii only in degree from certain varieties of C stellatus
Lastly C intertextus in its peculiar radii closely resembles C
scabrosus and this latter species does not differ much from the other
species Hence the genus Chthamalus has no claims to be subdivided into
smaller genera

RangeThe species are found all round the world from as far as
I have seen  north to Cape Horn in  south All the
species of the habits of which I know anything are littoral and
in many parts of the world are excessively numerous quite covering
large spaces of the coastrocks and often coating the coastshells
Chthamalus dentatus is littoral like the other species but it
often lives attached on Balanus tintinnabulum and amphitrite on
the bottoms of ships arriving in British ports from the west coast
of Africa I do not know of any instance of more than two species
occurring in the same region Some of the species have large ranges
C scabrosus extends from the Falkland Islands and Tierra del Fuego
to Peru and C stellatus has an enormous extension over almost the
whole world excepting the west coast of South America and Australia
I do not believe any species of the genus owing probably to their
littoral habits have hitherto been found fossil

This species is very widely distributed and extremely common On
the coastrocks of the southern shores of England it is in parts
even more numerous than the Balanus balanoides with which it
often grows mingled As already stated it is often confounded in
British collections with this species of Balanus under the name
of Balanus punctatus that Montagu had this Chthamalus in view
when describing his Lepas punctatus is certain from his original
specimen in the British Museum but whether this was the case with
his predecessor Pulteney in the Dorset Catalogue I do not feel so
sure Chthamalus stellatus varies as we shall immediately see
extremely in appearance Some of the varieties as var depressus
which in external aspect are especially distinct I have no doubt are
really varieties but whether this is the case with some of the forms
from the more distant localities is a little more doubtful but I beg
that it may be observed that I have in the case of every one of the
varieties and of all the specimens from distant localities cleaned
with potash and most carefully examined the disarticulated valves and
likewise dissected the included animals body


  General AppearanceBritish specimens are usually conical and
  have their walls folded corroded in their upper parts with the
  radii not developed and the sutures more or less obliterated in
  this state the orifice of the shell is entire and very broadly oval
  I have seen specimens in this condition from Madeira Brazil and the
  Gulf of Corea The shells when crowded are rendered cylindrical
  and more or less elongated with the sutures as viewed externally
  quite obliterated the surface rugged and much disintegrated and
  the orifice nearly circular in this extreme condition I have seen
  specimens from England from near Genoa and from the mouth of
  the Plata the specimens from these last two localities were of
  remarkable size being half an inch in diameter and rather more than
  half an inch in height Again other British specimens fig  c
  though not nearly so common are rather steeply conical and have not
  only their sutures distinct but narrow radii are plainly developed
  on apparently both sides of the sutures in this case the orifice
  is slightly toothed and is rather elongated I have seen specimens
  in this condition but with their walls rather more deeply folded
  from the Cape de Verde and Philippine Archipelago Other specimens
  from some unknown tropical sea differed only in the walls being but
  slightly folded and being so perfectly preserved as to be externally
  covered with membrane this latter circumstance gave the specimens
  a peculiar appearance In this condition were some specimens fig
   d attached to oysters sent to me by Professor Agassiz from
  Charlestown and which differed from all the others that I have seen
  in the thinness and smoothness of their compartments and in the
  facility with which the compartments separated from each other and
  from the surface of attachment hence I have called this form which
  until finding more important differences I must rank as a variety
  fragilis it has stronger claims than the other varieties to be
  specifically separated but I suspect that it has been exposed to
  some peculiar modifying conditions

  Lastly we have the variety fig  b excellently figured and
  described by Poli under the name of L depressa this is much
  depressed with the walls thin not folded with the surface much
  corroded with the sutures very distinct with the radii not at all
  or barely developed but with the al largely developed and marked
  with lines of growth resulting from the diametric growth of the
  shell the orifice is hexagonal but broadest towards the carinal
  end most of the specimens but not all have on the under sides
  of their compartments rugged pillars depending from beneath the al
  for the purpose apparently of supporting the much depressed shell
  This much depressed variety attains a larger basal diameter but not
  a greater bulk or internal capacity than any other variety namely
  sometimes three quarters of an inch The great peculiarities of this
  variety result apparently from its much depressed form deeply
  corroded not folded walls and considerable diametric growth from
  the latter cause the al are largely developed as I can find neither
  internally nor externally any fixed diagnostic character I have not
  hesitated to rank this form as a variety Poli found his specimens
  mingled with the ordinary C stellatus on the shores of Sicily
  and I collected at St Jago in the Cape de Verde Archipelago some
  specimens nearly as well characterised also associated with the
  common variety

  The shell itself is dirtywhite or gray or brown in some varieties
  however the white is nearly pure internally the parietes are
  generally tinted dull purple The corium of the sack is dark
  greenishblack with a white edge to the lips lining the aperture
  between the opercular valves

  Structure of Shell and Radii cThe under side of the parietes
  is either quite smooth or marked with slight branching depressed
  lines or mamillated or irregularly studded with large pores I have
  already alluded to the pillars depending from the under sides of the
  al in most specimens of var depressus these pillars tend to form
  ridges parallel to the sides of the compartment like those we shall
  presently see in certain specimens of C scabrosus The radii are
  very narrow when best developed their edges when disarticulated
  can be seen when examined by a strong lens to be finely crenated
  The edges of the al are likewise very finely crenated

  ScutaThe outline of these valves varies considerably in
  specimens taken out of the same group we have either a nearly
  equilateral triangle fig  f or the tergal margin  e
  is much shorter than the other margins There is always a deep
  depression for the adductor muscle and a small pit of very variable
  depth for the lateral depressor But the tergal margin offers
  the greatest variability here we see a very prominent articular
  ridge or fold having either a straight edge or a single or double
  prominence fig  e h In specimens in the same group we
  find considerable variation in these points but the amount of
  difference is sometimes so great that I long hesitated whether
  to rank some of the varieties as species The Terga likewise
  vary greatly in shape and width in some of the commonest varieties
  and in var depressus the valve is very narrow with the under
  surface channelled or concave in other varieties the valve is much
  broader and flatter The spur is but slightly developed The crests
  for the depressor muscles barely descend beneath the basal margin of
  the valve The articular ridge in some varieties as in specimens
  from Madeira and the Cape de Verde Islands is extremely prominent
  and straight  f in others it is little prominent and deeply
  sinuous  h This great variability in the articular margins
  of the scutum and tergum seems to be mainly due to the corrosion
  to which these valves have been subjected and their consequently
  modified growth in some specimens the articular ridge of the scutum
  and in others that of the tergum has been largely developed in
  either case their mutual outlines being greatly affected

  BranchiThese are narrow hardly at all plicated elongated
  being about half as long as the sack In a specimen from La Plata
  this organ ended rather more abruptly in a point than it did in other
  specimens

  MouthThe crest of the labrum is usually hairy but in a specimen
  from Bahia Brazil there were some very fine teeth The palpi vary
  somewhat in shape and sometimes have a row of bristles along their
  basal exterior margins The mandibles usually have four main teeth
  the lowest one being confluent with the inferior pectinated angle in
  var depressus in the same individual there were only three teeth
  on one side of the mouth and five on the other the lower main teeth
  are laterally double but generally one tooth of each pair is so
  small and obscure as to be perceived with difficulty In the maxill
  there are some large spines above the notch and in the notch some
  fine ones in var depressus and in a cylindrical var from La
  Plata there was quite a tuft of small spines above the notch

  CirriThe outer surface of the pedicel of the second cirrus
  bears a tuft of long fine plumose hairs the terminal segments of
  the rami of this cirrus sometimes as in the La Plata specimens
  support a clump of coarsely pectinated spines In specimens having
  six segments in the shorter ramus of the second cirrus the shorter
  ramus of the third cirrus had fifteen segments The two rami of the
  third cirrus are usually equal in length and in the number of their
  segments but in the Brazilian specimen there were fifteen segments
  in the posterior and twentysix in the anterior ramus in another
  specimen fixed on a tropical Perna there were in the two rami of
  this third cirrus eighteen and twentyfour segments In the three
  posterior pairs of cirri each segment carries either four or five
  pairs of main spines the segments vary a little in the degree to
  which they are elongated being most elongated in the var from La
  Plata with an elongated shell

  VarietiesIt will have been observed that the shell in the
  specimens from several distant quarters of the world over which this
  species as I believe ranges differs considerably in external
  aspect so do the opercular valves and so do the parts of the
  mouth and cirri but I cannot make out that these differences are
  coordinated Thus var depressus which is so entirely different
  from the others in appearance differs only internally in the
  presence of a tuft of fine spines above the notch of the maxill
  and this character is found in the La Plata variety which as far
  as the shell and opercular valves are concerned is at the other end
  of the scale of variation Again var fragilis from Charlestown
  presents in the animals body hardly any difference The Brazilian
  specimens which in the shell and operculum offer only quite common
  characters have the remarkable peculiarity of a considerable
  difference in the length and number of the segments in the rami of
  the third cirrus they also have the segments of the sixth cirrus
  considerably elongated and the labrum finely toothed Of these
  peculiarities one alone namely the inequality in the rami of the
  third cirrus but in a lesser degree is common to the specimens
  adhering to the tropical Perna which had a shell very unlike the
  Brazilian variety but which on the other hand differed scarcely in
  a single character from some other specimens from an unknown tropical
  sea in which the rami of the third cirrus were quite equal The La
  Plata specimens differ most in internal characters viz in the
  tuft of fine spines above the notch of the maxill in the coarsely
  pectinated spines on the tips of the second pair of cirri in having
  the segments of the sixth cirrus much elongated and in the apex of
  the branchi being abruptly pointed yet in the shell and operculum
  they were identical with certain Mediterranean varieties From these
  several facts I must believe that all the widely distributed forms
  here grouped together do really belong to the same species

  General Appearance and Structure of ShellShell conical rather
  smooth when not much corroded of a pale dirty fleshcolour often
  covered by membrane sometimes deeply corroded extremely rugged
  and then of a brown colour in this condition not much punctured
  as generally is the case with C stellatus Sutures almost always
  quite distinct rarely the shell becomes cylindrical with the sutures
  obliterated Orifice moderately elongated subhexagonal Radii
  rather narrow but not so narrow as in C stellatus smooth with
  their upper margins very oblique when disarticulated their edges
  are quite smooth The edges of the al are sometimes crenated and
  sometimes not so being only marked by lines of growth they are
  often rather thick The parietes are usually rather thick with their
  internal surfaces smooth and not mamillated as is so often the case
  with C stellatus The largest specimens which I have seen were 
  of an inch in basal diameter

  Opercular ValvesThese are hardly distinguishable from those of
  C stellatus The only very slight difference which I can point out
  is that the crests for the tergal depressores are less spread out
  and depend rather more beneath the basal margin of the valve and
  lastly that the surface of the tergum just above these crests is
  rather prominent

  Branchi these are oblong taper but little and have a broad
  rounded end they are scarcely plicated

  MouthThe crest of labrum is hairy the palpi are square and
  have no bristles along their basal exterior margins but long ones
  at their truncated ends The mandibles have three or four main teeth
  apparently single the inferior coarsely pectinated portion is short
  The maxill are deeply notched

  CirriThe first and second pairs and portions of the third are
  darker coloured than the three posterior pairs The rami in both of
  the first two pairs are slightly unequal in length The third cirrus
  is much longer than the second in a specimen in which there were
  six segments in the shorter ramus of the first and second pairs
  there were twenty segments in the posterior and shorter ramus of
  the third cirrus and in this same individual there were no less
  than fortynine segments in the anterior ramus In another specimen
  Pl  fig  the number of segments in the two rami of the
  third cirrus was  and  in another the numbers were  and
   in several other specimens the numbers varied in about these
  proportions but in one single specimen the numbers were equal
  Not only did the number of segments thus vary in the two rami
  but likewise the arrangement of the spines on the segments in the
  anterior and longer ramus in some specimens the spines on all the
  segments were arranged in a single circle and then the organ had a
  specially antenniformed appearance in other specimens some of the
  lower segments in one case thirteen in number had the spines placed
  in regular pairs precisely as on the posterior ramus and as on the
  three posterior pairs of cirri Under the genus I have pointed out
  the resemblance between this structure and that occurring in certain
  Macrourous Crustaceans The pedicel of the third cirrus had its
  spines more crowded and irregular than on the three posterior pairs
  of cirri The segments in the latter vary in bearing either three or
  four pairs of main spines The whole dorsal surfaces of the lower
  segments of the several posterior cirri are serrated in an upward
  direction by short spines but to a variable degree

pointed

  General Appearance and Structure of ShellShell dirty white or
  gray sometimes tinted pale purple within irregularly conical or
  much depressed or cylindrical and much elongated Generally much
  corroded sometimes well preserved and covered by membrane Orifice
  rather large of variable shape Sutures often quite obliterated
  Radii when developed narrow with their sutural edges as well as
  those of the al generally very finely crenated but to a variable
  degree The membrane lining the sheath and covering the opercular
  valves is remarkable from each zone being fimbriated for this
  expression is more correct than to say that the membrane bears a row
  of spines though the fimbri do approach in character to spines
  sometimes though rarely the fimbri are branched The largest
  specimens which I have seen from Coquimbo and Valparaiso were half
  an inch in basal diameter and some of these were so much elongated
  as to be one inch in height

  ScutaThe scuta are rather narrow they have a somewhat peculiar
  appearance from the articular furrow being wide and from the
  articular ridge projecting with a uniform curvature the pit for the
  lateral depressor muscle has some minute crests of which I have seen
  traces in the foregoing species The Terga vary somewhat in shape
  they have the basicarinal angle of the valve where the narrow
  crests for the depressores are placed pointed and dependent and
  the surface of the valve above these crests is prominent Altogether
  the opercular valves have a sufficiently distinct character to be
  recognised without much difficulty

  MouthThe crest of the labrum is not toothed the palpi have long
  hairs along the exterior basal margin The lower main teeth of the
  mandibles are plainly laterally double CirriThe pedicel of the
  second cirrus is extremely broad and on the exterior margin supports
  a tuft of very long finely plumose spines in some specimens each of
  the lower segments of the anterior ramus of this cirrus bore one or
  two very large spines doubly and extremely coarsely pectinated In
  two specimens the rami of the third cirrus were of equal length but
  in one specimen from Iquique Peru having seven segments in the
  shorter ramus of the first and second pairs of cirri the posterior
  ramus of the third pair had fourteen segments and the anterior ramus
  twentytwo segments The posterior cirri have segments carrying five
  pairs of main spines the dorsal surfaces of the lower segments are
  serrated

  General Appearance and Structure of ShellShell globuloconical

  generally distinct in young specimens and nearly obliterated in
  fullgrown individuals Radii when present very narrow The orifice
  of the shell in fullgrown specimens which have their summits a
  little worn is narrow much elongated about twice as long as wide
  oval or ovate with the rostral end the narrowest the elongation of
  the orifice offers almost the only character by which this species
  can be externally recognised The lateral compartments are rather
  wider than usual in proportion to the rostrolateral compartments
  Basal diameter of largest specimen  of an inch

  Scuta elongated transversely with the pit for the adductor muscle
  bordered on the under side by an adductor ridge rather more prominent
  than usual in this genus Terga triangular equilateral with
  the margins slightly curved and protuberant the basal margin is
  regularly and equably curved from one end to the other

  Neither the Mouth nor Cirri offer any peculiar characters
  distinct from the genus I may mention however that the crest of
  the labrum is toothed and that the segments of the posterior pairs
  of cirri support five pairs of main spines

The characters by which this species differs from C stellatus and
from the other species consist almost exclusively in the triangular
and equilateral terga and in the much elongated orifice of the shell
and these differences I believe to be of specific value I must
however confess that I have examined one young specimen attached to
a Pollicipes elegans in which the orifice was not nearly so much
elongated and in which the terga were not so equilateral with the
basal margin not quite equably curved but more protuberant on the
scutal than on the carinal side from an examination however of only
one specimen and that a young one I cannot decide on its specific
nature

  broadly and irregularly folded fig  a with the surface
  corroded or when attached to ships bottoms and sometimes to other
  Cirripedes narrowly and regularly folded  b with the surface
  well preserved smooth and generally covered by thin brown membrane
  These latter specimens generally have the shell more steeply conical
  with the orifice rather smaller and the radii broader than in
  the firstmentioned specimens which are attached to coastrocks
  and shells and have had their summits worn down The sutures in
  all cases are tolerably distinct and have their edges toothed and
  interlocked the crenations are visible before the compartments are
  disarticulated when viewed either internally or externally but
  occasionally they are obscure The radii when best developed are
  rather narrow and of equal width on both sides of the sutures with
  their summits rounded their surfaces are finely ribbed transversely
  each rib corresponding with or rather forming a point of the
  toothed edge On the under side these teeth usually are a little
  hollow or are pitted the radii in fact may be said to be folded
  like the parietes only more symmetrically and narrowly so that the
  points in the opposed edges interlock The edges of al are serrated
  but more finely than the radii The parietes are rather thin with
  their under surfaces generally smooth The sheath does not descend
  far down the shell The colour of the corium lining the sack and the
  animals body varies considerably being either almost black or pale
  purple and the specimens adhering to ships bottoms are internally
  almost white Of these latter specimens I have seen some  of an
  inch in basal diameter of corroded specimens attached to littoral
  shells I have not seen one quite  of an inch in basal diameter

  Scuta with the articular ridge very prominent the pit for the
  adductor is deep and there are generally some distinct though
  minute pits for the lateral depressores The Terga fig  c
  have the articular ridge very prominent and the carinal margin is
  rather more arched and protuberant than in the other species

  MouthThe crest of the labrum is toothed the palpi are short
  truncated with long spines arising from their ends and along the
  basal exterior margin In the mandibles the first tooth is seated
  rather far from the succeeding teeth the inferior part is coarsely
  pectinated the maxill are deeply notched The tips of second pair
  of Cirri have many coarsely pectinated spines the shorter ramus
  had six segments whilst the shorter ramus of the third pair had
  eighteen segments the segments on the posterior cirri carry five
  pairs of main spines

  Branchi cThese consist of a double fold the outer one being
  the largest and the inner semicircular as has been described under
  the genus In a young specimen only one tenth of an inch in basal
  diameter the branchi consisted of a single fold in a specimen a
  little larger there were two folds but these were of equal size
  ultimately the outer fold increases in size so as to become nearly
  double the inner fold The Ovarian tubes are remarkable from their
  large diameter I was surprised to observe in the specimen only one
  tenth of an inch in basal diameter that the larv were ready to
  escape On the prosoma there are some longish hairs arranged in
  short rows and some few on the membrane lining the sack and some on
  the opercular membrane and valves

It may be seen in Pl  fig  a and  b that I have here
united two varieties considerably different in external aspect I have
done this without hesitation inasmuch as there are intermediate forms
and as the differences are analogous with those so commonly occurring
in sessile cirripedes dependent on whether or not the specimens
have been exposed to corrosion I have seen both varieties from
Natal and both from the west coast of Africa although the smooth
wellpreserved narrowly plicated varieties seem more common in western
than in southern Africa With respect to the range of the species I
have seen a specimen from the West Indies but it was the variety
which so commonly adheres to ships bottoms This variety often arrives
alive in British ports and I have seen a specimen picked up dead on
the beach near Dublin




 CHTHAMALUS HEMBELI Pl  fig  a d e

  EURAPHIA HEMBELI Conrad Journal Acad Nat Sc Philadelphia vol
          Pl  fig 

Shell dull reddish purple sutures when not obliterated formed
by interlocking teeth basis sometimes rendered calcareous by the
inflexion of the parietes scutum with two or three furrows extending
down the middle of the valve

  HabCalifornia near S Diego according to Conrad Mus Brit
  Cuming


I have seen five old large specimens from an unknown locality with
their whole surfaces deeply corroded and with most of the sutures
obliterated and three separated valves of a young specimen From these
materials imperfect as they are I feel no hesitation in identifying
this species with the Euraphia Hembeli of Conrad which is remarkable
in several respects and especially from being gigantic in size
compared to other members of its subfamily


  General Appearance and Structure of ShellThe young specimen
  fig  b about  of an inch in basal diameter consists only of
  the carina and the two lateral compartments but these as far as
  I can judge resemble the specimen figured and described by Conrad
  which was two inches in diameter Shell depressed spreading surface
  moderately smooth covered by brownish membrane shell itself pale
  dull reddishpurple The radii are not very narrow with their
  summits rounded and very oblique their edges are toothed and their
  external surfaces are transversely ribbed in correspondence with
  the interlocking points of the sutures On the internal surface the
  toothed suture is not visible except near the base of the shell
  owing to the overlapping of the al The al have oblique summits
  which are slightly notched owing to the upturned prominent lines of
  growth The parietes are thick their basal internal surfaces are
  rugged with slightly branching ridges

  The old specimens fig  a are so much corroded that not a
  particle of the external surface is left one of them which was
   of an inch in basal diameter Shell much depressed spreading
  colour pale purple orifice large rhomboidal with a slight hollow
  on each side for the corners of the scuta sutures generally in
  part or wholly obliterated where still preserved the interlocking
  toothed structure is distinct the sheath is strongly marked by lines
  of growth and is of a dark brown colour The carina and rostrum
  are of unusually large size compared with the lateral compartments
  and this as far as I can judge must have been the case with the
  younger specimens That portion of the rostrolateral compartment
  which forms part of the sheath is reduced to a mere ridge The most
  remarkable character is that all these old specimens of which the
  smallest measured nearly one inch and a half in diameter had a flat
  wide calcareous basis which is absolutely continuous with the inner
  lamina of the parietes whereas in the younger specimen there was no
  appearance of any tendency in the parietes thus to grow inflected
  There can be hardly any doubt that in a series of specimens some
  would be found with the parietes first forming a flat narrow ledge
  round the true basal membrane as in the following species and that
  in others this ledge would be wider and wider till its edges met in
  the middle and coalesced into a continuous plate

  Opercular ValvesI have seen these only in the old corroded
  specimens fig  c  d they are locked together by remarkably
  strong articular ridges and furrows

  The Scuta have externally two or three impressed lines or narrow
  furrows proceeding from the apex to the middle of the basal margin
  these can be seen only in one of my specimens owing to the degree
  to which the valves have suffered disintegration but they are
  mentioned by Conrad The basal margin is rather short compared with
  the other two margins The tergal margin is remarkable from the depth
  of the upper furrow above the articular ridge and from the size of
  the prominence appearing like the true apex of the valve above
  this upper furrow There is a hollow for the adductor muscle and
  traces of crests for both the rostral and lateral depressores The
  Terga are generally but little corroded and hence the dark brown
  membrane with which they are covered is well preserved the shelly
  matter itself is also brown there is only a trace of this colour in
  the more corroded scuta the external surface of the terga is very
  smooth The spur is pretty well developed and is half as wide as
  the whole valve The lines of growth are upturned along the carinal
  margin The articular ridges and furrows are much developed The
  crests for the depressor muscles are extremely strong they depend
  beneath the basal margin and are remarkable fig  c from being
  furnished each with fine subcrests

Shell when well preserved violetpurple sutures when not
obliterated formed by oblique interfolding lamin basis membranous
but surrounded by a ledge formed by the inflected basal edges of the
parietes scutum and tergum completely calcified together

  HabPhilippine Archipelago Mus Cuming


  General Appearance and StructureShell depressed with a
  large diamondshaped orifice Colour beautiful violetpurple but
  externally much obscured by disintegration causing the shell to
  be ashy gray Walls smooth or slightly folded Sutures generally
  quite or almost quite obliterated but when well preserved they
  differ remarkably in appearance from those in the foregoing species
  for the radii externally here consist of oblique plates or lamin
  arising on both sides of the sutures standing nearly parallel to the
  parietes and interfolding with each other These lamin are rather
  plainly marked by lines of growth Essentially the radii do not
  differ much from those in C dentatus and Hembeli we have but
  to produce obliquely upwards the transverse and interlocking ribs on
  their radii and so convert them into lamin During the diametric
  growth of the shell the sutural edges of the al are added to in
  the usual manner by upturned lines of growth and in addition the
  recipient furrows of the al are similarly added to so that the
  lines of growth are upturned and al appear to have been developed
  on both sides of the sutures in the same way as the radii appear to
  have been developed on both sides in many Chthamalin though rarely
  in the Balanin The inside of the shell is beautifully coloured rich
  violet it is punctured with small holes as so often is the case with
  C stellatus In every specimen all fullgrown which I opened
  the inner basal edges of the parietes were inflected rectangularly
  inwards forming a smoothedged ledge all round the basal membrane
  which in proportion to the width of this ledge was by so much
  reduced in diameter The largest specimen which I have seen was 
  of an inch in basal diameter

  Opercular valvesThe scuta and terga in all the specimens which
  I have seen were firmly calcified together in some a trace of a
  suture could be seen externally but hardly a trace internally In
  one specimen there were vestiges of some impressed lines on the
  scutum in exactly the same position in which such occur in C
  Hembeli The scutum is rather narrow The basal margin of the tergum
  is either straight or depends a little on the scutal side thus
  producing a small spur the crests for the depressor muscles are
  strongly marked and depend beneath the basal margin

  MouthThe labrum is strongly toothed the palpi have long hairs
  along the exterior basal margin the mandibles have only three main
  teeth and the inferior coarsely pectinated portion is short the
  maxill deeply notched Cirri the first and second pairs have
  their rami slightly unequal in length the third pair differs from
  the same pair in the other species of the genus in having some few
  of the basal segments on the anterior ramus thickly clothed with
  spines so as to be brushlike there is even a trace of a similar
  structure in the lowest segments of the posterior ramus In the three
  posterior pairs of cirri the segments are much elongated and support
  four pairs of spines

  General Appearance and StructureShell generally depressed when
  growing crowded sometimes cylindrical colour dingy purplishbrown
  but when much corroded dirty gray very young shells are very dark
  green owing to the corium which is of this colour being seen
  through the valves Surface generally rugged from irregular slight
  longitudinal folds and from the transverse overlapping tilelike
  lines of growth but sometimes the surface is nearly smooth with
  very slight longitudinal folds these being gray coloured the
  intermediate parts being pale dingy purple the shell thus becoming
  striped Orifice rhomboidal passing into trigonal owing to the
  great width of the carinal end Sutures generally very distinct
  rarely obliterated in the cylindrical varieties Radii narrow
  generally exposing much of the al which are plainly marked by
  lines of growth the radii themselves when well developed which
  is not often the case consist of small lamin or ridges placed
  on both sides of the sutures and interfolded or interlocked
  together usually only a trace of this structure is exhibited
  but occasionally along some or along all the sutures as in the
  specimen figured the lamin of the radii interfold as plainly as
  in C intertextus The al differ slightly from the al of the
  other species in not forming so much of a rectangular projection
  the lower margin running with a gentle curve into the parietes The
  internal surface of the parietes is either smooth or near the basal
  margin is roughened with depending points in some specimens from the
  Falkland Islands both edges of each suture were inflected forming
  a double ridge with roughened edges resting on the basal membrane
  and supporting the shell I must mention that in my notes made at
  these Islands I remark that the basal membrane seemed sometimes to
  be surrounded by a calcareous rim none of the specimens brought home
  are thus characterised but bearing in mind the affinity of this
  species to C intertextus no doubt we have here an indication
  of the shelly ledge surrounding the basis as described under that
  species The largest specimens which I have seen are a quarter of an
  inch in basal diameter

  The Opercular Valves generally have their summits much worn down
  The scuta are elongated in the line of the longer axis of the
  orifice the articular ridge is very prominent and is placed in
  the middle of the tergal margin The terga are very narrow as
  in some varieties of C stellatus they are remarkable in two
  respects namely in the depressor muscle being attached to a plate
  formed apparently by the union of the usual crests parallel to the
  outer lamina of the valve itself a deep narrow cavity fig  d
  p being thus formed and secondly in the far more extraordinary
  circumstance of the existence of a small pit q at the extreme
  basiscutal corner of the valve in which about half of the scutal
  lateral depressor muscle is attached I have observed no other
  instance in any cirripede of the partial attachment of a muscle
  properly belonging to one valve to another valve The figures of

  perfect with the upper portion not worn away the ordinary
  appearance of the valves as seen from above is given in fig  a
  at fig  d a view is given of the tergum seen from vertically
  beneath showing the cavity for its own depressor muscle and for

  MouthThe crest of the labrum is hairy without teeth the palpi
  have long spines at the end but none along the inferior margin the
  mandibles have either four or five graduated teeth the lower ones of
  which are plainly double laterally the maxill have a very sinuous
  edge Cirri the first and second pairs are very short on the four
  posterior pairs the segments support either four or five pairs of
  main spines with the small intermediate spines rather larger than
  usual

  BranchiNone but where they ought to occur there are two very
  slight ridges clothed with hairs about the th of an inch in
  length On the prosoma there is a slight ridge extending from the
  base of the first cirrus towards the adductor scutorum muscle also
  clothed with hairs this unusual character of the prosoma being hairy
  is common to C dentatus

This species is the commonest cirripede on the shores of the Falkland
Islands many of the specimens are there crowded together and rendered
elongated and cylindrical with the walls very thin and the sutures
often obliterated as the opercular membrane is very narrow the
opercular valves are much influenced both in their outline and in
their crests and articulations by the varying form of the shell I
have even seen specimens with the scutum and tergum on one side twice
as large as on the other side

The two species united under this genus agree in having only four
compartments and in these having a strong tendency to become
confluent but they resemble each other hardly in any other respect
more than do all the species of the present subfamily Chamsipho
columna differs from all the other Chthamalin in the structure of
its second pair of cirri and C scutelliformis differs from all in
its shellnamely in the small size of the rostrum with its al
but little developed and in the very peculiar apertures in the three
other compartments Hence this genus can hardly be considered a very
natural one though I could not introduce the two present species into
Chthamalus or into any other genus without doing still more violence
to the principles of classification followed throughout this work
Chamsipho bears nearly the same relation to Chthamalus as Tetraclita
and Elminius do to Balanus

Sutures excepting during early youth generally obliterated both
externally and internally tergum with small pits for the attachment of
the depressor muscle

  HabNew South Wales Tasmania New Zealand extremely common
  attached to littoral shells and rocks often associated with
  Chthamalus antennatus and Elminius modestus and in New Zealand
  often thickly coating Elminius plicatus


I have identified with some doubt the present species with the Lepas
columna of Spengler obtained from Otaheite as no description is
given by him of the opercular valves and more especially as Spenglers
specimens were an inch in height and seven lines in width which is
much larger than any of the many specimens seen by me from Spenglers
clear description of the structure of his shell it evidently belongs
to the present genus


  General Appearance and Structure of ShellThe sutures separating
  the four compartments are generally excepting at an early age quite
  obliterated both internally and externally the shell in this case
  consisting of a single piece with its summit and opercular valves
  always much worn Occasionally the sutures are preserved and then
  the four compartments are seen to be of nearly equal sizes The
  orifice is always broadly oval with the carinal end the broadest
  and it often approaches closely to circular The upper part of the
  shell is frequently steeply conical with the lower part spreading
  and folded sometimes deeply folded Very young shells are apt to
  be remarkably smooth The radii appear never to be developed the
  inside of the shell is smooth The colour is either blackishgreen
  this being the tint of the corium lining the sack with the upper
  part gray from disintegration or the lower part is brown from
  the investing membrane the shell itself being pale coloured This
  species seems particularly liable to grow crowded together often
  covering rocks and shells with a honeycombed layer The basal
  diameter of some of the largest specimens was  of a inch In Mr
  Cumings collection however there is an Australian specimen 
  in diameter and  in height which is moreover remarkable from
  the projecting extremely rugged overlapping darkcoloured layers
  of growth which surround the lower part of the shell we have seen
  that Spenglers specimens said to have come from Otaheite are even
  broader and considerably higher

  Scuta from the disintegration which the valves have undergone the
  scuta and terga are externally seen to be locked together by a deeply
  sinuous articulation The Scuta have a wide articular furrow and a
  very prominent articular ridge but the exact outline of these parts
  varies greatly very much as in the genus Chthamalus

  The Terga are very narrow with the under surface channelled the
  attachment of the depressor muscle offers the only peculiaritythe
  muscle being attached to four or five little pits placed
  transversely to the longer axis of the valve the septa between these
  little pits evidently answering to the crests as usually developed

  MouthThe crest of the labrum is hairy and slightly bullate
  The palpi are rather small with long spines at their ends The
  mandibles have four sometimes five teeth with the inferior portion
  pectinated The maxill are notched

  CirriThe first pair presents no remarkable character The second
  and third pairs are subject to extreme variation as in Chthamalus
  antennatus and Tetraclita porosa In all the specimens the
  anterior ramus of the second cirrus is short with all the segments
  thickly covered with bristles it is the posterior ramus which varies
  so much in relative length and in the arrangement of the bristles
  but in no case are all the segments clothed with bristles as on
  the anterior ramus and as is normally the case with all sessile
  cirripedes In some specimens from New Zealand the anterior ramus
  having only five segments the posterior ramus was twice as long
  having sixteen segments with the bristles arranged in circles
  but standing rather thicker together on the basal segments In a
  Tasmanian specimen the posterior ramus was only a little longer than
  the anterior ramus and the spines were arranged in regular pairs as
  on the three posterior pairs of cirri on all the segments excepting
  the few basal ones on which they were more crowded a nearly similar
  arrangement occurred in some other specimens from unknown localities
  excepting that the rami were of nearly equal length In the third
  cirrus in all the specimens the anterior ramus has three or four of
  its basal segments much broader than the upper segments and thickly
  clothed with spines as is the case with one species of Chthamalus
  viz C intertextus all the other segments having regular pairs
  of spines The posterior ramus of the third cirrus varies in being
  either much longer than or only equal in length to the anterior
  ramus in the former case in the New Zealand specimen the spines
  were arranged in circles giving an antenniformed structure to the
  ramus and in the latter case they were arranged in regular pairs
  In Mr Cumings great Australian specimen there was a further
  peculiarity in the presence on the posterior cirri of a tuft of
  intermediate spines between the main pairs and in there being on
  those segments which are thickly covered with spines certain very
  large spines doubly pectinated with the pectinations elbowed
  closely like the spines met with on the cirri in certain species of
  Pollicipes Finally the segments in the three posterior pairs of
  cirri support five or six pairs of main spines the dorsal surfaces
  of the segment are rough and hairy

 CHAMSIPHO SCUTELLIFORMIS Pl  fig  a d

Rostrum very small elongated triangular lateral compartments each
with an aperture and carina with two similar apertures all four
leading into shelly tubular columns

  HabAttached to Pollicipes mitella probably from the seas of
  China Mus Brit


  General AppearanceThis very singular shell would not without
  some examination be thought to be a cirripede From the symmetrical
  position of the four apertures with the diamondshaped orifice in
  the middle with the sutures on each side of the rostrum and from
  its depressed and circular form this shell bears some resemblance to
  the perforated species of Scutella Shell much depressed generally
  nearly circular with the basal margin highly sinuous and even
  sometimes almost branched Surface slightly irregular marked by
  fine lines of growth and covered by brown membrane Of the four
  compartments the Rostrum is very narrow triangular and comes up
  to the orifice almost in a point it is rather depressed that is it
  lies rather below the level of the other compartments the straight
  sutures separating it from the lateral compartments are distinct in
  the upper part though always obliterated in old shells in the lower
  part these sutures are generally far plainer than those separating
  the lateral compartment from the carina which in most cases are
  obliterated and calcified together excepting close to the orifice
  The al of the rostrum are not externally visible and there are no
  radii to any of the compartments The Carina is twice as broad as
  the rostrum and is furnished with al of the usual shape which are
  to a certain extent externally visible The Lateral Compartments
  are broad being broader than the carina they are both penetrated
  down to the surface of attachment by a hole or rather tubethe
  two holes standing opposite the rostral end of the operculum the
  carina is penetrated by two rather smaller but similar holes It
  is these four holes which give to this cirripede its very singular
  aspect they are rather smaller than the orifice of the shell they
  are oval with their longer axes placed in the direction of the ray
  of the circular shell their manner of formation will be immediately
  explained The orifice is neatly diamondshaped and broad it is
  rather small compared with the whole shell and is closed by the
  operculum which is seated near the summit of the shell Basal
  diameter of largest specimen  of an inch few however attained
  this size and perfect larv were included in much smaller specimens

  Structure of ShellThe rostrum fig  c is remarkable from
  its small size and from the plainness of its sutures in comparison
  with those separating the other compartments and this is exactly
  the reverse of what I should have expected in a compartment tending
  to become rudimentary Not only is the rostrum small but the al
  project to an unusually small degree and gradually slope away into
  the lower part of the parietes These peculiarities are even more
  strongly marked in very young shells thus in one of the size of a
  pins head the rostrum consisted of a minute parallelogram without
  as far as I could see any al and was only one fourth of the size
  of the carinathis latter compartment being only half as wide as
  the lateral compartments The carina at this early period had quite
  distinct al

  The tubular prolongations from the four external holes are of course
  very conspicuous on the under side of the shell  b and their
  structure is there plainly seen In extremely young shells the holes
  are not present but very soon at four points of the circumference
  namely two in the carina and one in each lateral compartment the
  basal edge becomes indented and during growth more and more deeply
  indented at last the horns or points of the bays thus formed in
  the circumference of the shell grow inwards and meet the four
  indentations being thus converted into four rings or holes as
  the shell is added to at its circumference these come to stand
  further and further from the exterior margin and as the shell at
  the same time rises above the surface of attachment the holes are
  added to at their basal edges and are thus converted into shelly
  tubes generally freely open at the bottom as well as at the top
  Sometimes these tubes are closed at the bottom and this is usually
  caused by their sides having been added to in a spiral direction A
  somewhat sinuous double ridge or fissure leading from the tubes or
  holes to the exterior border can always be perceived on the under
  side of the shell Occasionally though rarely in very old shells
  a second series of holes is formed outside the first four holes
  and often a tendency to this may be perceived in the justmentioned
  fissures expanding a little at their outer ends thus forming four
  new circumferential indentations The purpose of this peculiar
  structure apparently is to give support to the much depressed and
  thin shell In Chthamalus stellatus and scabrosus we have seen
  a slight indication of a similar structure in the formation on the
  under side of the shell but confined to the lines of sutures of
  obscurely tubular pillars we have also something analogous in the
  singular midribs in Platylepas causing the membranous basis to be
  convex I need only further add that the parietes in Chamsipho
  are rather thin and are composed of translucent shell punctured for
  the entrance of tubuli with the punctures often arranged in straight
  lines

  Opercular Valves fig  dThese are attached by a narrow
  opercular membrane to the sheath but little beneath the summit
  of the shell The Scuta are considerably arched or convex the
  articular ridge is very prominent and there is a thick strong
  adductor ridge The Terga have a short rather broad rounded spur
  placed very nearly in the middle of the valve the crests for the
  tergal depressores are moderately developed and are simple

  MouthThe crest of the labrum is hairy and is much hollowed
  out The palpi are small and narrow with long bristles at their
  apices The mandibles have four or five teeth with the lower part
  pectinated The maxill are notched Of the Cirri the second pair
  is short and all the segments are thickly clothed with bristles
  The third pair in the arrangement of the bristles resembles the four
  posterior pairs The segments in these pairs are elongated and
  support four pairs of main spines

  I was not able to observe any Branchi

The two species here included form a very natural genus though
as far as the shell alone is concerned at first sight there is an
unusual amount of difference between them This genus offers an
instance of a case far from uncommon in nature though so unfortunate
for the systematist in which the most obvious and useful characters
of a group are completely masked When I first examined Pachylasma
giganteum I did not doubt that it was a Balanus and when
I first looked at P aurantiacum I thought from there being in
appearance only four compartments that it was an Elminius in neither
case from the absence of al to the rostrum did I even suspect
that the species belonged to the subfamily of the Chthamalin
But when I examined the included animals body I found in both
species the labrum bullate not notched with the palpi small and
the mandibles with their lower teeth not laterally double Again I
found in the third pair of cirri only the basal segments thickly
clothed with spines and lastly there were caudal appendages Now
these characters are preeminently those of the Chthamalin in fact
they are those met with in the typical genus Octomeris with the
exception of the presence of caudal appendages and these occur in
Catophragmusa genus standing next to Octomeris and in no other
genus of sessile cirripedes Moreover if we look to the shell of
Pachylasma the absence of pores in the parietes or at least of
symmetrical longitudinal ribs on their inner surfaces and the peculiar
character of the narrow radii hardly differing in structure from the
parietes are characters which are rare in the Balanin but universal
in the Chthamalin Hence taking the whole organisation of the two
species of Pachylasma it is certain that they must be ranked amongst
the Chthamalin though the leading character of the group namely
the rostrum being furnished like the carina with al here fails
Owing to this conviction I examined very young individuals of P
giganteum and in specimens only the th of an inch in height I
was interested by finding eight separate compartments with the rostrum
having distinct al hence at this early age as far as the shell is
concerned this species may be said to be an Octomeris and we have
seen that this likewise holds good with the included animals body as
the young shell increases in size the minute rostrum and rostrolateral
compartments blend together Pl  fig  b without even traces
of sutures being left

     Dr Philippi called this species a Chthamalus giving this
    generic name from an examination only of the separated valves in a
    fossil condition

With respect to Pachylasma aurantiacum I have no doubt that at an
early age it would possess a perfectly distinct rostrum with al for
in the one specimen which I have seen the compound rostrum is divided
by sutures faintly visible both externally and internally Pl 
fig  a  b into three compartments B A B of which the
middle one or true rostrum still shows in the manner in which it
underlaps the little rostrolateral compartments vestiges of al I
may remark that we have here the same structure as in Chelonobia
formerly described with the following differences that here the
sutures pass through the outer lamina of the parietes so that as
seen externally the separation of the three compartments is much
more perfect than in Chelonobia on the other hand internally the
separation is less distinct as the two rudimentary rostrolateral
compartments do not form part of the sheath Pachylasma aurantiacum
is further remarkable from the two lateral compartments C D on
each side tending to blend together being only separated by sutures
not more distinct externally than those separating the compound
rostrum but more distinct internally for they run up the sheath
From these facts it follows that this species viewed outside
without particular care would be said to consist like an Elminius or
Chamsipho of only four compartments if the sheath alone were looked
at there would be said to be six compartments but when the walls
especially their basal edges are carefully examined either internally
or externally the eight compartments can be plainly distinguished

With respect to the affinities of this genus we have seen that both
in the included animals body and at an early age in the shell it
is extremely close to Octomeris in the presence of caudal appendages
and in the basis being calcareous we have a clear affinity with
Catophragmus in the two lateral compartments of P aurantiacum
tending to become blended together we have some relationship exhibited
to Chamsipho as is likewise shown in the structure of the second and
third pairs of cirri If the genera of the Chthamalin were ranged in a
circle Pachylasma would be the point of contact with the Balanin I
must repeat that it is extremely unfortunate that when the shell alone
of P giganteum is examined it is hardly possible to separate this
genus from Balanus

  Stutchbury Lyell Philippi


I owe to the kindness of Dr Philippi authentic specimens of his
Chthamalus giganteus from the tertiary beds of Messina had this
distinguished naturalist seen recent specimens or a fossil one with
all the valves united he would no doubt have perceived that this
species cannot be classed with Chthamalus I am also indebted to
Sir Charles Lyell for some magnificent specimens which he himself
collected near Messina


  General AppearanceShell conical rugged irregular with the
  lines of growth plain colour dead dirty white Orifice large
  diamondshaped narrow towards the carinal end notched Radii
  narrow barely distinct from the parietes in the same individual
  sometimes absent and sometimes forming a mere ribbon confined to
  the lower edge of a compartment The diametric growth is effected
  by the al which seen externally are broad and strongly marked by
  lines of growth Basal diameter of largest recent specimen 
  height of highest compartment a carina  and width at base of
  widest rostrum  of an inch Amongst the fossil specimens height
  of highest compartment a carina  width of the same one inch
  width of widest rostrum  of a inch One of these carin a little
  below the middle point was actually  of an inch in thickness from
  which circumstance I have given the generic name of Pachylasma

  Scuta triangular but the width varies a little growthridges
  prominent sinuous with a few slight furrows radiating from the apex
  of the valve Internally the articular ridge is not very prominent
  nor is there a deep depression for the adductor muscle and none for
  the lateral depressor muscles The upper part of the valve projects
  freely

  Terga broad broader than the scuta the growthridges are
  prominent and angularly upturned close along the scutal margin the
  carinal half of the valve is smooth with the faintest traces of
  longitudinal stri A portion of the valve nearly half of its entire
  width on the scutal side is slightly depressed below the general
  level and depends slightly beneath the basal margin on the carinal
  side this evidently forms the spur The carinal margin is nearly
  straight with the lines of growth upturned along it Internally the
  articular ridge in the upper part is extremely prominent the crests
  for the depressor muscles are very prominent and depend beneath the
  basal margin like a comb they extend over nearly half the basal
  margin and the muscle in a corresponding manner is unusually
  spread out

  Structure of Shell and Radii the compartments are attached to
  each other less strongly than in any other cirripede which I have
  examined so that when dried specimens are soaked in spirits of wine
  they generally fall to pieces with a touch In full and halfgrown
  specimens the carinolateral compartments are nearly as broad as the
  lateral compartments in very young specimens about th of an
  inch in basal diameter they are proportionally much narrower The
  walls are strong even in young specimens in old ones they attain a
  thickness I have scarcely seen equalled except in Chelonobia Their
  internal surfaces are smooth as is the basal internal margin in
  young specimens but in old specimens it is roughened with short
  blunt ridges and little points The Radii are often absent when
  present they are very narrow and consist merely of a ribbonlike
  portion formed by obliquely upturned layers of growth more
  prominent than on the parietes The Al are very largely developed
  they are added to during the diametric growth of the shell in a
  regular sweep all the way down to the basal margin and consequently
  they do not form a rectangular shoulder as is usual externally they
  are plainly marked by lines of growth they are added to a little
  above the line of attachment of the opercular membrane their summits
  are very oblique The sheath has its basal edge slightly hollowed out

  Basis solid calcareous very irregular and of variable thickness

  I have under the Genus alluded to the structure of the rostrum
  in one shell the basal diameter of which barely exceeded th
  of an inch the compound rostrum being ths of an inch in
  height had its basal margin being ths of an inch in width
  rendered deeply sinuous see Pl  fig  b by two indentations
  corresponding with and caused by two notches at the top of the valve
  These two notches extended down barely th of an inch strictly
  ths from the summit and then disappeared so that when the
  shell was under th of an inch in height only one distinct zone
  of growth having been formed the now compound rostrum consisted
  of three separate compartments and there were eight compartments
  altogether Of the above three little compartments the middle one
  or true rostrum had large al which could be most distinctly seen
  extending on both sides under the little rudimentary rostrolateral
  compartments These latter overlapped the compartments on both sides
  of them as in all the Chthamalin

  Mouth labrum bullate with no central notch nor is the inner fold
  of the labrum forming the suprasophageal cavity thickened as in
  Balanus minute muscles run from this inner fold straight back to the
  cavity formed by the outer bullate fold the crest of the labrum is
  hairy with a row of the minutest beadlike points or teeth Palpi
  small broad placed almost parallel to the sides of the mouth with
  their apices not nearly touching each other Mandibles with three
  large nearly equalsized single teeth the whole inferior angle
  strongly pectinated Maxill small with a broad square notch
  beneath the two or three great upper spines

  Cirri first pair short with the rami equal in length Second
  pair with the anterior ramus having broader segments than those
  of the posterior ramus and with all the segments except the few
  uppermost thickly covered with spines the posterior ramus has
  rather less than half the segments thickly covered Third pair very
  slightly shorter than the sixth pair anterior ramus with the lower
  segments less than half of the whole in number thickly covered
  with spines posterior ramus with only the lowest segments about
  one fifth of the entire number thickly covered the other segments
  of these two rami and the upper segments of the posterior ramus of
  the second pair closely resemble in the regular arrangement of their
  spines in pairs the three posterior pairs of cirri The pedicel of
  the third pair supports numerous irregularly scattered bristles The
  segments of the sixth pair bear four or five pairs of main spines
  with a few intermediate spines

  Caudal AppendagesMultiarticulate narrow tapering situated on
  each side of the anus each segment has two little tufts of spines
  on each side of its upper edge These appendages are about one third
  longer than the pedicel of the sixth pair of cirri in a specimen
  in which the rami of the sixth pair had twentythree segments the
  caudal appendages had nineteen segments

  Penis short hairy finelyringed with no projecting point at its
  dorsal basis Branchi moderately large nearly circular not much
  plicated

  Fossil SpecimensWith respect to the Sicilian specimens sent me
  by Dr Philippi and Sir C Lyell I can see no difference whatever
  from the recent specimens excepting in their greater size and
  thickness it must however be borne in mind that I have seen only
  halfadozen recent shells The one fossil scutum which I have seen
  is rather broader than is usual with the recent but I have seen one
  nearly as broad This species seems to have been extremely common
  when the beds at Messina were deposited and probably it attained
  a larger size than it does at present The compartments are always
  found separated which is easily understood by the facility with
  which as above stated recent specimens fall to pieces




 PACHYLASMA AURANTIACUM Pl  fig  a d

Shell tinged with orange viewed externally seems formed of only four
compartments owing to the carinolateral and lateral compartments on
each side being separated only by an obscure fissure

  HabNew South Wales apparently from deep water attached to
  sandstone

     I am indebted to Mr Bowerbank for this unique and
    interesting species which I have deposited in the British Museum


  General AppearanceShell conical smooth with a tinge of orange
  colour orifice large deeply notched subtriangular Viewed
  externally the compartments in appearance are only four but on
  close examination the lateral compartments are seen to be divided
  by a very fine fissure into two nearly equal compartments The
  rostrum is broad and flat and when carefully examined it also is
  seen to be divided by two fine fissures into three compartments
  of these the middle one or true rostrum is a very little broader
  than the rostrolateral compartment on each side hence on careful
  examination the shell is found to consist of eight compartments The
  carina is much compressed The radii in my one specimen are not
  developed The carina and the two lateral compartments alone have
  al for the carinolateral compartments are too closely joined to
  the lateral compartments and the true rostrum is too closely joined
  to the rostrolateral compartments to have their al developed The
  four al which are developed are very broad widely exposed and
  marked externally by lines of growth The basal diameter of my one
  apparently old specimen is one inch

  Structure of Shell cThe inner surface fig  b of the
  rather thick parietes is smooth except close to the base where
  it is roughened by a few irregular points The sheath descends
  low down and has its lower edge slightly free The sutures are
  much plainer on the internal than on the external surface and
  can be here plainly seen to be eight in number That portion of
  the carinolateral compartment which helps to form the sheath
  is narrow though the whole compartment is of very nearly equal
  width with the lateral compartment It is a singular fact that no
  portion of the rostrolateral compartment helps to form the sheath
  for the al of the lateral compartments overlap the whole upper
  part of the rostrolateral compartments and abut against the true
  rostrum Hence when the sheath alone is examined the number of
  the compartments appears only six In a section the true rostrum
  can be seen to underlie the rostrolateral compartments and thus
  exhibits vestiges of al The fact of the rudimentary rostrolateral
  compartments not forming a part of the sheath offers a marked
  difference from Chelonobia which otherwise has this part of the
  shell very similarly constructed The diametric growth of the shell
  which seems to be considerable is effected by the four large al of
  the carina and of the lateral compartment on each side The sutural
  edges of the al are added to in a regularly inclined line down to
  the basis The basis is calcareous and not very thin

  Both opercular valves fig  c  d closely resemble those of
  the last species

  The Scuta are remarkably narrow and elongated the external
  surface is slightly furrowed longitudinally the prominent lines
  of growth are much wrinkled The articular ridge is blunt and not
  very prominent The upper part of the valve is reflexed and a
  considerable portion must have projected freely The Terga are
  nearly twice as broad as the scuta the carinal half of the valve is
  very smooth and is coloured beautiful reddishorange The spur is
  tolerably distinct The articular ridge is not very prominent

  The Mouth resembles that of the last species The mandibles have
  three sharp teeth with the inferior part narrow and pectinated
  with long spines the edge also between the upper main teeth is
  pectinated with short spines which latter often have their summits
  crenated The maxill are notched the inferior corner is produced
  into a small stepformed projection The outer maxill are more
  pointed than is usual

  The Cirri most closely resemble in every detail those of P
  giganteum I can point out only one slight difference namely that
  the lower segments in the posterior ramus of the third cirrus which
  are thickly clothed with spines are more numerous in proportion to
  the upper segments with the spines arranged in regular pairs being
  as  to  than in P giganteum in which only one fifth or  to
   are so clothed

  Caudal AppendagesThese are very small not being more than
  one fifth of the length of the pedicel of the sixth cirrus their
  segments are indistinct and they support a very few coarse spines
  The rami of the sixth cirrus in the one specimen had twentyfive
  segments whilst each caudal appendage had only five Hence the
  caudal appendages are far less developed than in P giganteum

The two species of this genus differ considerably in external
appearance though not in essential character Both as the name
expresses have eight compartments the carinolateral pair are
rather narrower than the lateral The basis is membranous The radii
are narrow and are distinctly crenated on both sides of the sutures
with the teeth neatly interlocking but these teeth can hardly be
distinguished in the large corroded specimens of O angulosa The
crenated structure of the radii is identical with that described
under Chthamalus dentatus and Hembeli if indeed we were to add
carinolateral compartments to the shells of these two species they
would belong to Octomeris I have seen only a few specimens of either
species of Octomeris and none preserved in spirits and therefore I
know nothing of the anatomy of the softer parts I was not able to make
out distinctly any branchi The cirri differ considerably in the two
species in nearly the same way as in the two species of Chamsipho In
the structure of the second pair of cirri and in the tendency of the
basal margin of the parietes to form baylike indentations Octomeris
angulosa shows some special affinity to Chamsipho scutelliformis
Under Pachylasma I stated that that genus was closely related to
Octomeris and I have just alluded to the close affinity of the latter
to the division of the genus Chthamalus which has crenated radii

  Mus Brit Cuming Stutchbury Bowerbank


  General Appearance and Structure of ShellShell extremely rugged
  irregular massive generally much corroded steeply conical or even
  subcylindrical orifice large broad rhomboidal of nearly equal
  breadth at both ends Colour dirty white often slightly tinted
  yellow from the investing membrane and from thin layers of punctured
  membrane alternating with the lamin of shell The parietes in old
  specimens have very irregular longitudinal ridges or rather plates
  projecting out sometimes much branched and generally curved inwards
  so as to meet each other thus forming round the basal margin a
  circle of cylindrical apertures In old large specimens the radii are
  not developed and till the compartments are disarticulated there
  is no trace of the toothed structure of their sutural edges in
  this condition the sutures exist as deep rugged narrow fissures
  In younger shells the radii though narrow are distinct and have
  their surfaces transversely ribbed and their edges toothed and
  interlocked with the teeth of the recipient furrow Some of the
  specimens present a curiously deceptive resemblance to Elminius
  plicatus Basal diameter of largest specimen one inch and a
  quarter height one inch

  The parietes are remarkably thick but the compartments separate
  easily I have however seen one instance in which they were
  partially calcified together Their internal surfaces are
  very smooth The sheath does not descend low The al project
  rectangularly they have thick edges and these are coarsely crenated
  in transverse lines Of the radii sufficient has been said

  Scuta fig  b these in all the specimens seen by me but
  one have been deeply corroded and their outline as in Chthamalus
  considerably modified in the one specimen well preserved the
  exterior growthridges were extremely prominent The articular ridge
  does not project much nor is the articular furrow very deep There
  are more or less distinct crests for the lateral depressor muscles
  The Terga are rather narrow with a small rounded spur moderately
  distinct The tips of the crests for the depressor muscle barely
  depend beneath the basal margin

  Mouth labrum considerably bullate with the crest hairy and
  furnished with a few most minute teeth Palpi small with their
  tips not nearly touching each other Mandibles with four teeth
  of which the lower ones are laterally double inferior pectinated
  portion small The maxill are notched but their outline differed on
  opposite sides of the individual examined Outer maxill bilobed on
  their inner face

  CirriThe first pair has the rami unequal in length by about
  three segments having six segments on one and nine on the other
  ramus In the second pair the anterior ramus is remarkably short and
  extremely broad the five segments of which it is composed being
  thickly covered with bristles some of which are very coarsely and
  doubly pectinated the posterior ramus is nearly twice as long as
  the anterior ramus and has eleven segments of these excepting the
  two basal segments which are rather thickly covered with spines the
  others resemble in the arrangement of their spines the four posterior
  pairs of cirri with the exception that there is a single transverse
  row of rather long spines along the upper and inner lateral edge
  of each segment The segments in all the four posterior pairs of
  cirri resemble each other in bearing each four pairs of main spines
  of which the two lower pairs are short with a tuft of small
  intermediate spines

  The penis is remarkable from its very small size and shortness not
  being more than once and a half as long as the pedicel of the sixth
  cirrus

Shell reddishbrown depressed thin finely furrowed longitudinally
tergum with the basal margin having a slight angular bend

  HabPhilippine Archipelago rare Mus Cuming


  General Appearance and StructureShell circular much depressed
  coloured brown with an orangered tint surface regularly and
  narrowly furrowed in longitudinal lines the intermediate rounded
  ridges projecting at the basal margin in fingerlike points The
  eight compartments when disarticulated are of nearly equal sizes
  the carinolateral and rostrolateral compartments being rather
  smaller than the others The radii are neatly toothed but with the
  exception of these teeth which are equally developed on both sides
  of the sutures and which closely interlock in the lower part of the
  shell but stand a little apart in the upper part the radii can
  hardly be said to be developed The al do not form a rectangular
  shoulder the lower margin being regularly curved into the parietes
  the upper margin is only slightly oblique the external surface
  is furrowed by lines of growth The shell increases a little in
  diameter chiefly by the growth of the al The parietes are not very
  thick with the inner surface smooth but with punctures placed in
  rows for the entrance of the tubuli the lamin of shell alternate
  with layers of yellow finely punctured membrane Basis formed of thin
  membrane in concentric slips Basal diameter of largest specimen 
  of an inch

  Scuta broad with the lines of growth few in number but extremely
  prominent so as to form folds basal margin with a very slight
  angular bend articular ridge not very prominent Terga with a
  narrow slip along the scutal margin having the lines or folds of
  growth so prominent as almost to form a series of small transverse
  pits the basal margin of this portion forms an angle with the rest
  of the basal margin no spur can be said to exist the crests for the
  depressor muscle depend a little beneath the basal margin articular
  ridge very prominent

  Mouth labrum and palpi as in the last species Mandibles with
  three main teeth apparently single of which the lower tooth has
  its upper edge pectinated the inferior part of the mandible is
  pectinated as usual The maxill have two notches one beneath the
  two upper large spines and the other in the middle separating some
  thicker and thinner spines

  Cirri first and second pairs short with the anterior rami in
  each longer by about two segments than the posterior rami all the
  segments thickly covered with bristles The third cirrus is much
  longer than the second cirrus with the posterior ramus longer than
  the anterior ramus on the latter the three basal segments and on
  the posterior ramus the two basal segments are thickly covered with
  bristles the other segments have bristles arranged as on the three
  posterior pairs of cirri namely each segment has four pairs of main
  spines of which the two lower pairs are short

  The unarticulated support whence the articulated portion of the
  penis arises is unusually long equalling the pedicel of the sixth
  cirrus




 GenusCATOPHRAGMUS Pl 

  CATOPHRAGMUS G B Sowerby Genera of Recent and Fossil Shells
        Plate

Interior compartments eight with several exterior whorls of small
supplemental compartments basis either membranous or calcareous

  Distribution West Indies and Australia Attached to littoral
  shells and rocks


This genus is very remarkable amongst sessile cirripedes from the
eight normal compartments of the shell being surrounded by several
whorls of supplemental compartments or scales these are arranged
symmetrically and decrease in size but increase in number towards the
circumference and basal margin A well preserved specimen has a very
elegant appearance like certain compound flowers which when half open
are surrounded by imbricated and graduated scales The Chthamalin in
the structure of the mouth and cirri and to a certain extent in that
of the shell fill up the interval between the Balanin and Lepadid
and Catophragmus forms in a very remarkable manner the transitional
link for it is impossible not to be struck with the resemblance of
its shell with the capitulum of Pollicipes In Pollicipes at least
in certain species the scuta and terga are articulated togetherthe
carina rostrum and three pairs of latera making altogether eight
inner valves are considerably larger than those in the outer
whorlsthe arrangement of the latter their manner of growth and
unionall are as in Catophragmus If we in imagination unite some
of the characters found in the different species of Pollicipes and
then make the peduncle so short and it sometimes is very short in P
mitella that the valves of the capitulum should touch the surface of
attachment it would be impossible to point out a single external
character by which the two genera in these two distinct families could
be distinguished but the more important differences in the arrangement
and nature of the muscles which are attached either to the opercular
valves or surround the inside of the peduncle would yet remain

Although all the valves of the shell even the eight in the innermost
whorl are very thin yet from their number in the successive whorls
and from each being concave inwards so as to form a cavity or tube
into which the corium enters the total thickness of the sides of
the shell is very considerable Both of the species of Catophragmus
occurred mingled in the one case with Tetraclita porosa and in the
other with T purpurascens now the walls of these shells we know
are very thick and are permeated by several rows of pores occupied by
threads of corium seeing this we may be permitted to believe that
the several exterior whorls of valves in Catophragmus between which
the corium is prolonged for some way upwards are of service to the
animal by thickening its shell in an analogous but not homologous
manner as in Tetraclita

Considering the whole structure external and internal of
Catophragmus with the one great exception of the exterior whorls of
valves there is hardly a single generic character by which it can be
separated from Octomeris and Pachylasma indeed I am not quite sure
that it would not have been better to have run these three genera
together

Of the two species I will first describe C polymerus and
not the C imbricatus of Sowerby inasmuch as I have plenty of
excellent specimens of the former whereas the original specimens of
C imbricatus in the British Museum consist of one old and not
perfect shell without the opercular valves or the included animals
body and the other though quite perfect far from mature As far as
these materials allow of minute comparison the whole shell with the
exception of the basis and the opercular valves agree very closely in
the two species whereas the included animals body differs more than
is usual in nearly related speciesthus C imbricatus has caudal
appendages of which there is no trace in C polymerus and I have
seen only one other instance in which this organ was absent in one
species Scalpellum villosum and present in the other species of the
same genus Under these circumstances it will be most convenient first
to describe in detail C polymerus and then only indicate the points
of difference in C imbricatus

Basis membranous caudal appendages none

  HabNew South Wales Twofold Bay Mus Darwin Swan River 
  Mus Cuming Attached to littoral rocks and shells and associated
  with Tetraclita purpurascens Balanus nigrescens Chthamalus
  antennatus Chamsipho columna


  General AppearanceShell nearly circular moderately or slightly
  depressed colour gray The eight normal compartments of the inner
  whorl are two or three times as large as those in the second whorl
  the other smaller compartments or scales graduate very regularly in
  size to mere beads at the extreme basal edge and are arranged
  symmetrically The general aspect of the shell depends chiefly on
  the degree to which the surface has been disintegrated and differs
  greatly in the two extreme states When well preserved the general
  appearance is very elegant the scales are all neatly imbricated
  they terminate upwards in points but with their extreme tips
  generally broken from laterally overlapping each other their
  external surfaces as seen when corroded in fig  d or when
  slightly exposed after the continued growth of their basal margins
  in fig  a become longitudinally keeled often with a secondary
  ridge or shoulder on one side they are also crossed by rather
  conspicuous and regular lines of growth or more strictly former
  lines of union between the several valves the orifice of the shell
  in this perfect condition is subrhomboidal and notched and the
  scuta are united to the terga by nearly straight sutures On the
  other hand when the shell has been considerably corroded and this
  seems to be the more common condition the appearance is not elegant
  the scales in the successive whorls are not imbricated but owing to
  their upper parts having been worn down they present a tesselated
  surface  d with the tesser graduated in size and of a
  peculiar shape namely a rectangle with a more or less broad square
  projection on the exterior side together often with a large square
  notch on one or both corners caused by their laterally overlapping
  each other Some of the shells are so deeply corroded that no
  portion of the original surface is preserved excepting the lowermost
  beadlike scales and the whole shell has so rugged an aspect
  that the successive whorls of the worndown valves might easily be
  overlooked In the corroded specimens the orifice approaches to
  circular in outline and is large and nearly entire the scuta and
  terga are deeply interlocked together The largest specimen which I
  have seen was one inch and a quarter in basal diameter

  Structure of the ShellThe eight inner normal compartments are
  not thicker than the outer valves and are far thinner than in
  ordinary sessile cirripedes They are arranged as in Octomeris
  The lateral compartments are broader than the rostrolateral and
  carinolateral compartments The shelly lamin of which these
  compartments and the opercular valves are composed alternate with
  yellow membranous layers exactly as is the case with Octomeris
  The lateral edges of the compartments beneath the al in the six
  compartments having al bend inwards especially just above the
  basis so that the compartments in their lower parts fig  c
  stand much more separate than is usual The basal edge of each is
  irregularly toothed The sheath presents no particular character
  The eight compartments have longitudinal shoulders and ribs on their
  external surfaces caused by the lateral overlapping and pressure of
  the exterior scales They are also marked by slight transverse or
  oblique calcareous ridges caused by the attachment of the membrane
  by which they are united to the smaller compartments or scales
  outside them A new line of attachment and consequently a new ridge
  is formed lower and lower down at each period of growth as the
  shell is added to at the basisin the same manner as new ridges are
  added to the lower edge of the sheath at each period of growth The
  shell excepting in old worndown specimens increases largely by
  diametric growth during the diametric growth the outer scales must
  be laterally separated a little from each other and probably they
  are laterally added to but there are no distinct lines of suture
  or rows of smaller scales corresponding with the sutures between
  the eight inner compartments The al do not project much their
  edges as well as the shoulders into which they fit are generally
  irregularly crenated they are added to during diametric growth
  above the line of attachment of the opercular membrane There is no
  appearance of radii but as the eight inner compartments are added to
  laterally and are often crenated on the edges which correspond with
  the radii in other Cirripedes such edges must be considered as radii

  With respect to the scales in the several outer whorls they resemble
  each other except in size and the outermost scales are reduced to
  mere transversely elongated beads Their basal edges are concave
  inwards being bent like the ridge of a house hence subtriangular
  spaces or tubes lined by the corium run up between the scales When
  perfectly preserved the outline of each scale is a much elongated
  triangle but usually from their summits having been worn off the
  outline is nearly that of a parallelogram Their basal edges are
  dentated and their upper parts both on the outside and inside are
  marked where joined to the other compartments by slight calcareous
  ridges outside there are longitudinal shoulders Pl  fig 
  b caused by the lateral overlapping of the adjoining scales
  these are best seen in section in corroded specimens fig  d
  on the inside there are also in the upper part slight medial
  longitudinal ridges caused by the sutures which the scales have
  covered

  In large old specimens there are ten or even more whorls of
  compartments but it is scarcely possible to count them with
  any accuracy The first whorl consists of the eight large inner
  compartments though homologically it is doubtful whether the
  rostrolateral compartments in any sessile cirripede really belong
  to the same whorl with the others The second whorl consists of
  eight smaller pieces covering the eight sutures in the first whorl
  see the tracing of the basal edges of all the compartments and
  valves in a very perfect specimen Pl  fig  c The third
  whorl in large and perfect specimens consists of twice the number
  or sixteen still smaller scales corresponding with the sixteen
  sutures of the second whorl but sometimes there are less than
  sixteen pieces owing to some of the scales being large enough to
  cover two adjoining sutures as well as the intermediate portion of
  the compartments of the first whorl In the fourth whorl instead
  of there being even in the most perfect specimens twice sixteen
  or thirtytwo pieces there are only twentyfour this being caused
  by single pieces placed alternately with two pieces being broad
  enough to cover two sutures as well as the intermediate portion of
  the compartment of the third whorl In the succeeding whorls this
  same arrangement seems to be the usual one so that in the fifth
  whorl instead of there being in the most perfect specimens twice
  twentyfour or fortyeight pieces that is twice the number in the
  last whorl there are only thirtysix scales or once and a half as
  many scales

  The Basis is thin and membranous it firmly adheres to the surface
  of attachment

  Scuta nearly flat the articular ridge is very prominent and
  there is a deep articular furrow both above and below but the
  precise outline of the ridge and furrows varies there is a pit
  for the adductor muscle but no crests or marks for the other
  muscles The Terga are remarkable from the extreme prominence of
  the articular ridge and depth of the articular furrow The basal
  margin viewed internally seems straight so that there appears to be
  no spur but viewed externally when the crests for the depressor
  muscles are seen to depend considerably beneath the true basal
  margin a slight very broad spur may be perceived to exist These
  depending crests for the muscles are rather thin but they extend
  over half the basal margin of the valve

  MouthThe labrum is very bullate being as long in its
  longitudinal axis as the rest of the mouth crest hairy with some
  very minute teeth Palpi truncated with their apices not nearly
  touching each other thickly clothed with spines Mandibles with
  three large single teeth of which the lower one has a single
  fine tooth at its upper basal edge showing a tendency to become
  pectinated inferior part short coarsely pectinated Maxill
  notched with a slight second notch and slight double prominence in
  the lower part

  CirriFirst and second pairs short with the rami in each
  unequal in length by about four segments on both rami in the second
  cirrus and in the shorter ramus of the first cirrus there are some
  coarsely pectinated spines All four posterior cirri are alike the
  segments bear five pairs of strong spines with a large intermediate
  tuft of fine spines the dorsal tuft is also large consisting of
  short thick and long finer spines There is no vestige of caudal
  appendages though present in the succeeding species

  Branchi moderately large in area equalling the prosoma surface not
  plicated

  CATOPHRAGMUS IMBRICATUS G B Sowerby Genera of Recent and Fossil
        Shells Plate

Basis calcareous caudal appendages present

  HabAntigua West Indies attached to a Tetraclita porosa


  As stated under the genus this species is known from two specimens
  in the British Museum one of which is fullsized being three
  quarters of an inch in diameter but is destitute of the outermost
  whorls of the basis opercular valves and animals body the other
  is perfect but very young being barely two tenths of an inch in
  basal diameter As far as the characters can be made out from these
  materials I can perceive no difference from C polymerus in the
  shell excepting that in the small specimen of C imbricatus there
  would appear to exist fewer whorls The opercular valves are likewise
  closely similar in the scuta however of the young specimen in the
  present species the articular ridge seems to be a little broader
  but this is so variable a character that no confidence can be placed
  in it these valves moreover externally have a broad furrow along
  the middle running from the apex to the basal margin which is not
  the case with the scutum of C polymerus but then I have often
  seen in young specimens of Balanus a similar furrow which is quite
  absent in fullgrown specimens When we come to the basis we find a
  good diagnostic character for here it is calcareous it is rather
  thin solid and white towards the outside it is pitted with small
  cavities corresponding with the small teeth on the basal edges of
  the compartments The latter adhere firmly to the basis The central
  internal surface is covered by an irregular network of imbedded
  cementducts some of which bifurcate From the description here
  given it will be seen that any figure would have been superfluous
  the last species having been so well illustrated

  MouthI can point out no difference excepting that the palpi are
  here more oval or less truncated at their ends and that the lower
  corner of the maxill seems to be more prominent In the Cirri the
  rami of the first and second pairs are nearly equal in length none
  of the spines are coarsely pectinated In the four posterior pairs
  of cirri instead of a tuft of small spines on each segment between
  the pairs of main spines there are only a few minute intermediate
  spines the dorsal tufts are also here smaller but are as in the
  last species composed of short thick and longer thinner spines

  Caudal AppendagesThis is the only species of sessile cirripede
  with the exception of the two species of Pachylasma which possesses
  these organs they are situated on each side of the anus in the usual
  position they are minute equalling in length only the lower segment
  of the pedicel of the sixth cirrus in a specimen in which the rami
  of the sixth cirrus had eighteen or twenty segments these appendages
  consisted of only three tapering segments supporting a few thick
  spines

  BranchiI believe I discovered these consisting of two minute
  pouches placed at the carinal end of the sack if this observation
  be correct this species differs from C polymerus in the much
  smaller size of these organs




REMARKS ON BRONNS LIST OF FOSSIL BALANIN AND CHTHAMALIN


  The following species of fossil Balanid are given in that most
  useful work the Enumerator Palontologicus in Bronns Gesichte
  der Natur it has appeared to me that a few words on each species
  might hereafter save others the trouble of searching through several
  works

  Tubicinella maxima of Morren said to have been found in the Chalk
  this would have been a wonderful fact considering that no true
  sessile cirripede has hitherto been found in this formation and that
  it implies the existence of Cetacea at this period but I have been
  informed that the fossil in question is not a Cirripede

  Diadema bifidum  Coronula bifida of Bronn in his Italiens
  TertirGebilde  p  no Plate Without a much fuller
  description I can form no judgment on this species

  Diadema vulgare is probably the Coronula barbara a Crag fossil
  described by me

  Pyrgoma undata Michelotti in Bull Soc Geolog tom x p 
  a mere name without any description probably it is a synonym of

  Pyrgoma sulcatum Philippi Enum Mollusc Sicili which is a
  synonym of Pyrgoma Anglicum of the present work found recent and
  fossil

  Acasta Montagui is probably the extinct Acasta undulata described
  by me

  Chthamalus giganteus of Philippi is the Pachylasma giganteum of
  this work found recent and fossil

  Chthamalus stellatus said by Philippi to be found fossil in
  Sicily such may be the case but the littoral habits of the species
  do not render it very probable

  Balanus carbonarius of Petzholdt found in the Carboniferous
  formation but I have given my reasons in my Monograph on the
  Fossil Lepadid p  for disbelieving that this is a Balanus or
  even a Cirripede

  Balanus ostrearum appears to be a mere name by Conrad published
  by Morton in his Synopsis of the Organic Remains of the Cretaceous
  Group  Appendix p 

  Balanus peregrinus is briefly described and poorly figured without
  the opercular valves by Morton in his Synopsis ut supra p
   Pl  fig  this Eocene species apparently resembles the
  Eocene B unguiformis of Sowerby described in this work but quite
  indispensable details of structure for identification are not given
  Another figure of this shell is given in the American Journal of
  Science N S vol i Pl  fig 

  Balanus circinnatus communis and pustula of Defrance
  as well as all the other species named by him are described so
  imperfectly that the descriptions are of no value whatever every
  description being applicable to every species I must add that the
  B communis is not the B communis of British authors a name
  applied to several forms

  Balanus Finchii is briefly described and figured but without the
  opercular valves by Isaac Lea in his Contributions to Geology

  species

  approximately recognised

  Balanus proteus Conrad Fossil Shells of Miocene Formation of U
  States p  Pl  in Journal Acad Nat Sc Phil vol vii
  p  I cannot recognise this species it resembles B porcatus
  but as the radii are rather narrow and apparently with slightly
  oblique summits it may be B concavus the opercular valves are
  not figured

  Balanus sagittata is merely a provisional name without any
  description given in a paper on the Crag by S Woodward in the
  London and Edin Philosoph Magazine Brewster Taylor and
  Phillips vol vii JulyDecember  p 

  Balanus sublvis J de C Sowerby in Geolog Trans d series
  vol v Pl  fig  Plate extremely imperfect description
  extremely short and useless a species from India not to be

  Balanus balanoides the species thus named by Ranzani and found
  by Philippi in Sicily certainly is not the true Lepas balanoides
  of Linn but may be B amphitrite of this work In British
  collections of Crag specimens I have found the B dolosus nov
  spec thus named I much doubt whether the truly littoral B
  balanoides of Linnus has been found fossil

  B costatus of Montagu a synonym of B sulcatus of Bruguire
  and of B porcatus of this work found fossil and recent This
  species was originally described by Linnus under the name of Lepas
  balanus But the fossil Lepas balanus of Brocchi is a different
  species if it be the same with the recent Lepas balanus of Poli
  then it is the B perforatus of the present work Again the B
  sulcatus of Bronn in his Letha Geognostica tab  fig 
  is quite different from the B sulcatus of Bruguire i e
  B porcatus of the present work as is at once obvious from the
  oblique summits of the radii Lastly B tesselatus of Sowerby is a
  synonym of B porcatus sulcatus costatus and Lepas balanus

  B punctatus of Montagu is a synonym of Chthamalus stellatus see
  remarks on that species the name of B punctatus is often applied
  by British authors to varieties of B balanoides see remarks on
  that species

  B rugosus of Morriss Catalogue is a synonym of B crenatus
  found recent and fossil

  B sulcatus of Bruguire a synonym of B porcatus found recent
  and fossil see remarks under B costatus

  B tintinnabulum of Linn found recent and fossil but no trust
  whatever ought to be placed in the identifications of this species
  given in several works thus the Lepas tintinnabulum of Brocchi is
  distinct The B crassus of Sowerby is the true B tintinnabulum
  The B fasciatus of Dujardin perhaps only a MS name probably
  is also this species The B crispatus is only a variety of B
  tintinnabulum

  B dentiformis Defrance see B circinnatus

  B ornatus Mnster Beitrge zur Petrifact B  p  tab

  B porosus of Hausman according to Mnster of Blumenbach I

  B pustularis of Lamarck Animaux sans Vertbres Scarcely one
  of the fossil species of Balanus described by Lamarck can be
  recognised the descriptions are extremely imperfect There is a
  figure of B pustularis in Mnsters Beitrge which makes me
  think that this may be a synonym of B concavus of Bronn

  B stellaris Bronn Letha Geognostica tab  fig  To
  this species Lepas stellaris I presume a misprint for stellata
  of Poli is given as a synonym but the Lepas stellata of Poli is a
  Chthamalus and this certainly is not the case with B stellaris I
  have received two specimens from the Continent named B stellaris
  but they certainly differed from the form so called by Bronn for
  in that the parietes are said to be porose and the radii very
  narrow these foreign specimens I have named B inclusus A species
  described by me as B corrugatus resembles in external appearance
  the B stellaris of Bronn but it is mere labour in vain to attempt
  identifying Balani by their external characters

  B amphimorphus Lamarck see remarks under B pustularis

  B cylindraceus Lamarck From Chenus Illust Conch in which
  work Lamarcks original specimens are figured it appears that this
  is the B psittacus of South America where it is also found
  fossil but assuredly Lamarck is quite in error when he states that
  a variety of this species occurs fossil near Turin Bronn in his
  Italiens TertirGebilde p  gives as a synonym to the Turin
  fossil the Lepas tintinnabulum of Brocchi in the Conchologia
  Fossile Subapennina t  p  and this probably is correct
  and I have hardly any doubt that the Lepas tintinnabulum of Brocchi
  is the B concavus of Bronn described in the present work

  B perforatus of Bruguire is said by Philippi to be found in
  Sicily see remarks under B tulipa

  B semiplicatus Lamarck see remarks under B pustularis

  B tulipa of Mller is the B Hameri of this work under which
  name full information on its geological history has been given
  The B tulipa of Poli and Ranzani is the B tulipiformis of
  the present work and this latter species is said by Philippi to
  occur fossil in Sicily But there has been so much confusion in
  the identification of B tulipiformis B Hameri and B
  tintinnabulum and likewise of B perforatus which by Poli was
  wrongly considered to be L balanus Linn that doubts must be
  entertained about which have been really found until the Sicilian
  fossils are all carefully examined

  B ovularis Lamarck see remarks under B pustularis

  B Uddevallensis Linnus is probably a synonym of the B Hameri
  of this work and the B tulipa of Mller

  A few other references may be added to those given by Bronn

  B miser stated by Lamarck to be found fossil see remarks under
  B pustularis

  B patellaris of Lamarck is stated by Marcel de Serres to be found
  fossil with several other species of Balanus thus named without any

  B virgatus delphinus and crispus are names given by
  Defrance with absolutely worthless descriptions

  B radiatus is too briefly described by Risso Hist Nat de

 FamilyVERRUCID

Cirripedia without a peduncle scuta and terga not furnished with
depressor muscles moveable only on one side on the other side united
immoveably with the rostrum and carina into an asymmetrical shell


The one genus herein contained differs so considerably from all the
others in the Order in the extraordinary unequal development of
the two sides of the shell that I have instituted a Family for its
reception If compelled to place it in one of the foregoing families
I should with much hesitation rank it in the subfamily Chthamalin
rather than amongst the Lepadid for it is destitute of a peduncle
and has a shell though a very different one from that of any true
sessile cirripede In the interfolding sutures which may be considered
as representing radii or al in the basis being divided into
concentric slips and in the whole of the basis being attached to the
supporting object this same line of affinity is clearly manifested
On the other hand in the general shape manner of growth and kind
of articulation of the scutum and tergum there is so close an
approach to the Lepadid that had I seen these very important valves
separately I should certainly have concluded that they had come from a
Pollicipes allied to certain Cretacean fossil species as P fallax
and elegans it likewise perhaps deserves notice that the upward
growth of the rostrum in Verruca nexa is a peculiarity found only
in the valves of the Lepadid Verruca differs both from the Lepadid
and Balanid in the whole shell or external covering having no other
muscle besides the adductor scutorum In the characters derived from
the animals body Verruca approaches both families but in the absence
of branchi and in the great development of the caudal appendages
perhaps it comes rather the nearest to the Lepadid Whatever affinity
there is to the Balanid it is much stronger to the subfamily
Chthamalin than to the Balanin though the nonbullate labrum in
three of the species and the great dissimilarity of the third cirrus
from the three posterior pairs at first seems to indicate a closer
relationship to the Balanin but the labrum is never notched as in
the latter subfamily and in V nexa it is bullate and supports
palpi of only small size The dissimilarity also of the third pair
of cirri compared with the posterior pairs is hardly greater than
in Chthamalus intertextus and Chamsipho columna members of the
Chthamalin though abnormal in this one respect Perhaps even a
special affinity is evinced between certain species of Chthamalus as
C intertextus and certain species of Verruca as V nexa namely
in the interfolding sutures and in the very peculiar inflected basal
margin of the walls Upon the whole the affinities of the Verrucid
are complex and nearly equally divided between the two great families
of Balanid and Lepadid or sessile and pedunculated cirripedes

The shell in this genus is extremely unsymmetrical not two of the six
pieces of which it is composed quite resembling each other At first
it appeared hopelessly difficult to identify in a homological sense
these six valves with those of ordinary cirripedes but the difficulty
soon quite vanished The operculum consists of two moveable valves on
one side namely a scutum and tergum but without any moveable valves
on the opposed side the scutum though remarkable from being much
smaller than the tergum can be easily recognised by giving attachment
to the animals body and to the adductor scutorum muscle The four
other pieces are articulated together and form the shell surrounding
the sack in which the animals body is enclosed of these the two
against which the moveable scutum and tergum shut are smaller differ
greatly in shape and are articulated together in a different manner
from the remaining two pieces from these facts alone there would be
a strong presumption that they were of a different nature The fixed
valve against which the scutum shuts is either furnished with a
remarkably prominent plate a in fig  c s compare this with
s in the reversed shell in fig  e or is hollowed out as in
V nexa for the attachment of the adductor scutorum muscle Thus
it is rendered probable that this fixed valve is a modified scutum
but a surface of attachment for one end of the adductor muscle might
perhaps have been developed on any other valve or a scutum might
have become fused with a lateral valve of the shell the shell on
this latter view being rendered in idea more symmetrical But when
a very young specimen is carefully examined it is found that the
moveable and fixed scutum the moveable tergum and its opposed valve
or fixed tergum at the first period of calcification resemble each
other quite closely but that as each zone of shell is added the
differences become rapidly greater and greater hence it may be
considered as directly proved that the two fixed valves S and T in
all the figures in Pl  which are opposed to the moveable valves
of the operculum S and T consist of an extraordinarily modified
scutum and tergum It has been shown p  that at the period of
the metamorphosis the two scuta the two terga and the carina of
the Lepadid commence their growth under the form of the socalled
primordial valves and so differ from all the other valves when such
occur now in two species of Verruca I have found closely analogous
primordial valves on the apices of both the moveable and fixed scutum
and tergum thus affording strong additional evidence that their nature
has been rightly interpreted and on one of the two remaining valves
namely that at the posterior or carinal end of the shell Hence we
may safely infer that this latter valve which though very much more
developed on one than on the other side is so far medial as to curl
round and cover the line of opening between the moveable and fixed
tergum is really a carina The sixth valve differs only very slightly
in shape from the carina and is directly opposed to it therefore
in accordance with all analogy it must be the rostrum Consequently
the shell in Verruca consists of a moveable scutum and tergum a fixed
scutum and tergum a carina and rostrum and as we shall immediately
see a membranous basisthe basis being as in all sessile cirripedes
the homologue of the peduncle in the Lepadid

The moveable scutum and tergum stand at about right angles with the
fixed pair and as these latter form a part of the wall of the shell
which is always steep on this side the moveable pair which close the
orifice are nearly horizontal or parallel to the basis and surface of
attachment Hence the animals body which is attached between the two
scuta but nearest to the moveable scutum also lies nearly parallel
to the surface of attachment and I was consequently at first led to
suspect that the basal membrane was one side of the shell in a modified
condition but the presence of the prehensile antenn of the pupa in
nearly the middle of this membrane and the sheet of cementtissue on
its under side demonstrate that this membrane though lying on one
side of the animal is the true basis To make all the parts in Verruca
hold the same position as in other cirripedes relatively to the
surface of attachment we must develope the carina and rostrum equally
on both sides of the true longitudinal axis of the shell and insert
the newlydeveloped portion between the basis and the fixed scutum
and tergum reducing the latter in size and tilting a little up the
moveable scutum and tergum and by this means the animals body would
be turned so that its dorsoventral longitudinal plane would stand at
right angles to the basal membrane

Extraordinarily great as is the difference between the right and
left sides of the whole shell yet in all the species it seems to be
entirely a matter of chance whether it be the right scutum and tergum
with the right side of the rostrum and carina or the left scutum and
tergum with the left side of the rostrum and carina which become
abnormally developed Nor does there seem to be any relation between
the side of the operculum to be attached whether right or left and
the nature of the surface of attachment for I have seen many specimens
adhering to perfectly level surfaces and to quite cylindrical branches
of Laminari and in these cases however the larva might attach
itself there could be nothing to favour the development of one side
more than the other Although the attached scuta and terga are larger
than the moveable pair yet owing to the small development of the
carina and rostrum on the attached side the upper or unattached side
must be considered as the most developed In this respect and in
the circumstance of either right or left side being modified we are
reminded of the structure of Pcilasma Kmpferi described in my
former volume on the Lepadid in which the valves on the side of the
capitulum nearest to the crabs body to which the specimens were
attached were somewhat less developed than those on the opposite side
I may add that in ordinary Crustaceans as I am informed by Professor
Bell the unequal development of the thoracic limbs seems quite
capriciously to affect either the left or right side of the body

General Appearance of the ShellThe shell is in most cases much
depressed and irregularly circular the side formed by the fixed
scutum and tergum is always steeper than the other side the colour
is white or pale brownish and in V nexa pale red The surface is
naked The size is small rarely exceeding a quarter of an inch in
diameter and the whole shell often appears like a mere scale on the
surface of attachment The most remarkable feature in the external
aspect is due to the suture between the rostrum and carina which is
formed by oblique interlocking plates or folds as all these plates
continue to be added to at their extremities during growth the upper
plates become longer than the lower ones and the plates on both
sides of the suture together form a triangular area with the broad
end uppermost somewhat like the radius of a sessile cirripede they
act also like a radius for their growth serves to separate these
two valves and so adds to the diameter of the shell The suture
between the rostrum and fixed scutum and that between the carina and
fixed tergum are nearly of the same nature but the former is more
conspicuous than the latter neither are so conspicuous as that between
the carina and rostrum accordingly as the right or left scutum and
tergum are moveable so the suture second in plainness see Pl 
fig  a and  d is placed to the left or right hand The fourth
suture between the fixed scutum and tergum as viewed externally
is straight and so very obscure that it has been overlooked by some
authors and the shell described as consisting of only three nearly
equal pieces for the fixed scutum and tergum together are about equal
in size to the carina or rostrum The orifice approaches more nearly
to an unequalsided triangle with the apex broadly truncated than to
any other figure The operculum fits with remarkable closeness and
is surrounded by a slight rim formed by the edges of the four other
valves

Moveable Scutum and TergumThe scutum S in  b and  is narrow
and very small barely equalling half the size of the tergum and
therefore proportionally much smaller than in any other cirripede in a
very young shell however of V Strmia less than a pins head in
size the scutum equalled the tergum in size The valve is remarkably
thick it is generally depressed down the middle but in V nexa
this part is longitudinally ribbed The occludent margin is curved
On the tergal margin there are two articular ridges with a deepish
furrow between them of which the upper one  in S in fig  b
and  extends from the apex about halfway down the valve and the
other or lower articular ridge  in S generally runs down nearly
to the basal margin an angle running from the apex to the basitergal
corner of the valve appears like a third articular ridge but cannot
properly be considered such The above two articular ridges interfold
with analogous ones on the scutal margin of the tergum and so lock the
valves together On the under side fig  f the surface is bounded
along the occludent margin by a slight rim there is generally a very
slight depression for the adductor muscle but in V Spengleri there
is a straight short sharp Pl  fig  prominent adductor ridge

The moveable tergum is broad and rhomboidal Externally a prominent
axial ridge  in T in fig  b c which widens downwards
runs from the apex of the valve to the basal point and there
projecting slightly causes the scutum to be indented this indentation
on the scutum appears like a third articular ridge lying beneath
 S in fig  b c Above the lower and axial ridge on the
scutal margin of the tergum there is a middle articular ridge which
locks in between the lower  and upper articular ridges  of the
scutum S Again above the middle ridge there is an upper and third
articular ridge  which is either quite distinct as in fig  T
or more commonly is formed by the occludent margin of the valve as in
T fig  b The broad extremity of this upper articular ridge is
often produced into a slight projection or shoulder and this always
underlies the scutum of which the under and upper surface is indented
or furrowed see fig  f in order to receive this shoulder The
upper articular ridge of the scutum  S  b locks in between the
upper articular ridge or occludent margin  T and the middle ridge
 T of the tergum

Hence altogether there are three articular ridges on the scutal
margin of the tergum the occludent margin being generally counted
as one whereas on the tergal margin of the scutum there are only
two ridges though as before noticed an outer indentation which is
developed as a ridge in V nexa fig  S might almost be counted
as a third articular ridge

I may here just remark that the furrow between the two ridges on the
tergal margin of the scutum resembles the articular furrow in the
scutum of the Balanid but it may be doubted whether the resemblance
be more than superficial as this furrow in the case of Balanid
receives the edge itself of the tergum whereas here it receives only
a ridge proceeding from the apex of the tergum to a nearly middle
point on its scutal margin Finally I may add that the tergum in
this genus in general shape in growth presently to be referred to
in the manner in which the upper scutal shoulder is overlapped by
the scutum and in the presence of the axial ridge presents a very
striking resemblance to certain old fossil species of Pollicipes and
to a limited extent to the living species of Lithotrya

The scutum and tergum being interlocked move together they can be
firmly shut by the contraction of the long adductor scutorum muscle
Their opening appears partly due to the elasticity of the membranous
hinge representing the opercular membrane by which they are attached
transversely just beneath the summit of the carina and rostrum No
doubt the protrusion of the cirri effectively aids the act of opening
These valves are not capable nor of course the other valves of any
other movement for there are no muscles for such movements

Fixed Scutum and TergumThe fixed scutum is larger than the fixed
tergum and therefore has the same proportions as the homologous valves
in ordinary cirripedia but reversed proportions compared with the
moveable scutum and tergum The shape of neither valve can hardly be
described The fixed Scutum S in all the figs externally seems
at first to consist of two portions namely a curved occludent rim
a closely resembling the opposed occludent margin a of the
moveable scutum S having in fact undergone very little modification
as may be best seen in Pl  fig  b and secondly of a much
modified portion marked  which resembles in outline and state of
surface the rest of the walls of the shell and may be called the
parietal portion The rostrum A curls round the end of the occludent
portion under an edge b evidently answering to the basal margin
b of the moveable scutum and is simply united to this portion
by membrane but beyond this part it is articulated to the parietal
portion  of the fixed scutum by oblique interlocking ridges like
those forming the suture between the rostrum and carina In V nexa
however fig  the rostrum A does not curl round any part of the
interlocking fixed scutum S but articulates with it by a straight
suture Internally the fixed scutum S in figs  e  c of
reversed shells has a surprisingly large thin adductor plate m in
fig  c  b with a rounded outline projecting nearly parallel
to the basis or surface of attachment the adductor scutorum muscle
is attached to its upper surface and consequently the animals body
lies between this plate and the moveable scutum In the fixed scutum of
V nexa however there is a deep pit instead of a plate for this
muscle

The fixed Tergum likewise consists of two portionsa middle
and lower or parietal portion and a rim or upper portion the rim
consists of two unequal arms answering to the two upper margins not
merely the edges of the rhomboidal moveable tergum the longer rim
x in T see fig  answers to the carinal margin x of the
moveable tergum and may be called the carinal rim and the shorter
rim o and  in fig  answers to the occludent margin o and
 of the moveable valve and may be called the occludent rim The
carina curls round the end of the carinal rim under an edge z much
foreshortened in T in fig  b and best seen in fig  answering
to at least a large part of the basal margin z of the moveable
tergum and interlocks by a serrated suture with the edge of the
parietal portion of the valve Internally fig  e less plain in 
c there is a transverse ledge notched in the middle and sometimes
deeply hollow beneath running across the valve in about the line of
the adductor plate of the fixed scutum this ledge in fact marks
and is partly caused by the line of separation between the central
or parietal much modified and the scarcely modified upper or rim
portion of the valve The use of this ledge is apparently to give
attachment as does the under side of the adductor plate of the fixed
scutum to ligamentous fibres presently to be mentioned by which the
shell is attached to the basal membrane the carina and rostrum being
so much more gently inclined do not stand in need of a ledge for their
attachment

By comparing the moveable scutum and tergum with the corresponding
fixed valves in all the species the modification of the latter may
be clearly made out to have been effected as follows and the case
appears to me a striking and interesting one The moveable scutum
and tergum lie in the same plane and are articulated by the means
of three ridges on the tergum including the occludent margin and
by two on the scutum The fixed scutum and tergum have to be curved
and to be greatly increased in size and this is brought about as we
shall see by the large development of a certain small portion of each
valve Comparing first the moveable tergum T with the fixed tergum
T the umbo of growth matches the umbo of the four margins of the
moveable valve the carinal x basal z and occludent o in
fig  margins can be identified with certainty in the fixed valve
from their close similarity in shape their absolute apposition or
correspondence in position There remains only the scutal or articular
margin with its three articular ridges of these the uppermost 
inasmuch as in most of the species it is hardly distinct from the
occludent margin can as we have just seen be clearly identified and
is overlapped as it normally should be by the upper tergal corner
of the fixed scutum the second or middle articular ridge though
not so distinct as in the moveable valves can be plainly recognised
 T in fig  b and  and it serves its normal function of
articulating the two valves together But when we look in the fixed
valve for the third or axial ridge  we find in its exact place
namely extending from the umbo to the extreme opposite end of the
valve between the second articular ridge  and the basal margin
z see fig  only that portion of the valve which I have called
the parietal portion consequently I do not doubt that this really is
the axial ridge largely expanded So again in comparing the moveable
scutum S with the fixed scutum S two of the three margins of the
former namely the occludent a see fig  b and basal b
can be identified without a doubt in the fixed valve the third and
tergal margin remains this should have two articular ridges of these
the upper one still serving its normal function can be detected in
all the species  in fig  b and can be seen pretty plainly 
fig  in V nexa but of the lower and other articular ridge there
is no signexcepting indeed the whole parietal portion of the valve
which from holding an exactly homologous position with the lower
articular ridge of the moveable valve I cannot doubt in this ridge
expanded and curiously metamorphosed Hence in both fixed scutum and
tergum it is the outermost or lowest of the articular ridges which
has been modified and expanded so as to rest on and be fixed to the
surface of attachment It would appear as if it had resulted from one
ridge in each of these valves having been thus used up by expansion
so to express myself that the suture between the fixed scutum and
tergum is more simple than any other suture in the whole shell and it
is owing probably to this straightness and consequent tendency to
weakness that the valves do not grow along this line and so do not
become separated from each other during growth as on the three other
lines of suture As it actually is owing to this suture never being
separated it is even stronger than the others its edges on the inside
fig  c I may add are a little inflected or prominent

Rostrum and Carina these valves differ from each other only in
the former A being rather the largest and in being more plainly
articulated with the fixed scutum than is the carina B with the
fixed tergum Their umbones stand in their normal places at the
two ends of the orifice leading into the sack that is facing the
dorsoventral longitudinal plane of the animal but they are very
unequally developed on the two sides and hence they rise very
obliquely from the surface of attachment Their summits are nearly
square which is caused by the continued growth on both sides of the
oblique plates or ridges by which they are articulated with the
adjoining valves These plates strikingly resemble as already stated
the radii in certain species of Chthamalus Without these articulating
plates the outline of the rostrum and carina would have been
triangular with the apex upwards In V nexa in which the walls
of the shell are almost perpendicular the rostrum A fig  is very
peculiar and patelliformed with the umbo subcentral this results
from the development of a border at the upper end of the valve In this
same species the basal edges of the rostrum carina fixed scutum and
tergum are rectangularly inflected so as to form a ledge round the
basis as in the case of some few species of Chthamalusthe ledge
appearing like part of the real basis During the growth of the shell
the upper internal ends of the carina and rostrum are either rendered
solid or a ledge is formed on the inside across their summits hollow
beneath like the sheath of the Balanid to which solid or hollow
ledge the basal margins of the moveable scutum and tergum are attached
by a rim of membrane forming a hinge

Direction of Growth Minute Structure of ValvesThe shell grows
downwards all round its basal margin As far as the diametric growth
of its upper part is concerned there may be said to be only three
valves for the fixed scutum and tergum never become as already
stated separated on the three other lines of suture the valves are
added to on both sides and thus the whole upper part of the shell
and the orifice increases in diameter The moveable scutum and tergum
grow along their basal margins and along the margins by which they
are articulated together but the scutum in this latter respect less
than the tergum The summits of the moveable scutum and tergum during
continued growth become either worn away or they project freely in
this latter case an internal ledge is added round the upper end of the
fixed scutum and tergum so as to keep the orifice accurately closed
In V nexa the rostrum with its subcentral umbo is anomalous as
already stated owing to a broad upper internal border growing in a
direction almost directly opposed to the basal growth of the moveable
opercular valves

In young specimens on the apices of both scuta and both terga and
on the carina but not on the rostrum primordial valves may be
distinguished resembling the valves so called which first appear p
 Introduction after the metamorphosis in the Lepadid In the
Verrucid however they are calcareous and the minute transverse
cylinders of which they appear to be composed stand further apart
causing the surface of the primordial valve to be marked with little
separate circles instead of by hexagons

The shelly matter of which the valves are composed is translucent it
is remarkably destitute of any investing membrane The under surface
is marked with rows of minute approximate pores parallel to the lines
of growth into which the corium enters after a portion of shell has
been dissolved in acid these threads of corium are seen to change
a short distance within into cylinders of yellow chitine running
obliquely through the substance of the valve These cylinders are about
th of an inch in diameter but in parts they are spindleshaped
and twice as thick they vary in length about th of an inch
being the average length these cylinders at their upper ends suddenly
contract into a point more or less long or are produced into a very
fine tortuous tubulus of chitine imbedded in the shell I have seen
in no other Cirripedes tubuli of this structure There are other
ordinary tubuli such as occur in the valves of most Cirripedes about
th of an inch in diameter and which sometimes alternate with
the abovedescribed thicker cylinders There are no external spines
From the number and length of the tubuli of both kinds the tissue left
after the action of acid is singularly complicated

BasisThe basal membrane is thin and is divided but not very
plainly into concentric slips marking the successive increments of
growth In the middle of it in two young specimens I found with great
difficulty the pupal prehensile antenn they were of small size
measuring from the extreme edge of the main or second segment to the
end of the disc only ths of an inch the disc appeared narrow
as in Pollicipes and Scalpellum with a single spine at the proximate
end the ultimate segment placed as usual at about right angles to
the disc bore two groups of shorter and longer spines but I could
not count how many The antenn were enveloped in a mass of cement of
a yellow colour resembling in all its characters the cement of other
Cirripedes In only one case I believe I saw bifurcating cementducts
of extreme tenuity viz th of an inch in diameter The sheet
of cement on the whole under side of the basal membrane not rarely
shows a very irregular reticulated structure For convenience sake
it will be best to defer the discussion on the very anomalous though
slight powers of excavation which this genus possesses and which I
must attribute to the effects of some substance secreted probably by
the cementorgans I will here only mention that the specimens which
have excavated a depression are less firmly attached than those which
have not acted on their support and that in the former case the
basal membrane for a considerable space in the middle becomes quite
detached

Animals BodyThe body is much flattened and owing to the
little development of one side of the shell lies parallel to the
surface of attachment The prosoma is but little protuberant The
articulations of the thorax are unusually straight and transverse
The Mouth is also much flattened it is placed rather distantly
from the adductor scutorum muscle owing to the production of the
lower margin of the labrum The Labrum is not notched or even
hollowed out in the middle or excepting in V nexa bullate
its crest is surmounted by about eight more numerous in V nexa
little teeth or by some fine bristles The Palpi are of moderate
size with their tips nearly meeting they are slightly curved and
have bristles only on their outer sides and extremities they are
apparently capable of being lifted up and down by a muscle attached to
them just outside the rounded swelling on each side of the labrum to
which they are articulated in V nexa however the palpi are very
small and narrow and their tips do not nearly meet In this genus
therefore we find the swollen state of the labrum and the size of
the palpicharacters generally invariable and of high classificatory
importancevariable The mandibles have three upper main teeth
with two or three minute lower teeth or in V nexa with the
lower part pectinated with small spines in V Strmia I have seen
traces of the second tooth being laterally doublea character of
some importance The Maxill have a notch under the upper pair of
large spines with the lower part bearing as usual a double row of
bristles and forming a large stepformed projection these organs are
furnished with the usual apodeme and muscles The Outer Maxill are
prominent and deeply lobed on their inner surfaces the two lobes
being clothed with bristles

CirriThe first pair are attached as usual on each side of the
mouth and stand some way apart from the five posterior pairs The
second and third pairs differ considerably in structure from the three
posterior pairs which are much elongated The first pair excepting
in V nexa is short with the two rami slightly unequal in length
and with the segments thickly clothed as usual with spines The
second pair is remarkable from the posterior ramus being more than
twice as long and containing thrice as many segments as the anterior
ramus which is barely as long as the shorter ramus of the first pair
the segments in the anterior ramus of the second pair only five in
number in a fullsized specimen are broader and more protuberant in
front and more thickly clothed with spines the terminal spines being
doubly pectinated than are the segments on the posterior ramus on
the latter the uppermost segments have their bristles arranged in
front in simple pairs with the dorsal spines long the lower segments
being more thickly clothed with bristles owing to the development of
lateral rows The third pair resembles in every respect the second
pair except in being a little longer and in the bristles on the
posterior ramus being less crowded more resembling the arrangement of
those on the posterior cirri In V nexa however there is not so
great an inequality in length or dissimilarity in structure in the two
rami of the second cirrus and only a very slight difference of any
kind in the two rami of the third pair Fourth fifth and sixth
pairs have numerous elongated segments bearing four or three pairs of
long slender spines in front with a single minute bristle between each
pair and with two or three slender spines in the dorsal tuft

There is a considerable amount of variation in the proportional
length and in the number of the segments of the several cirri in
V Strmia in some specimens the two rami of the fourth pair were
unequal in length in some nearly all the cirri on the lower or
attached side were shorter than those on the upper side

Caudal AppendagesThese are of most unusual length sometimes
even exceeding those of Ibla quadrivalvis which surpasses in this
respect all other cirripedes They arise on each side and over the
anus They consist of numerous sometimes as many as twentyfour
unequal cylindrical thin segments bearing at their upper ends
a circle of long and very slender spines They sometimes equal two
thirds or even four fifths of the length of the sixth cirrus but
their length and the number of their segments sometimes imperfectly
divided varies much in different specimens of the same species
and sometimes even on opposite sides of the same individual In some
very young shells as big as a pins head the caudal appendages were
proportionally extremely short and consisted of only two or three
segments No muscles enter these organs and when the animal is taken
out of its sack they project straight out behind instead of being
curled in like the cirri

Anatomical StructureThe animals body is attached to the two
scuta by the adductor scutorum and by the other usual muscles running
towards the mouth and surrounding the prosoma The whole external
covering or shell has no other muscles Verruca thus differing from the
Balanid and Lepadid but the shell is attached all round near its
circumference to the basal membrane by a band of very short fibres
appearing like muscles but really ligamentous as determined for me
by Professor Quekett Branchi are entirely absent The alimentary
canal presents all the usual characters but in the prosoma is rather
abruptly bent back on itself The orifices of the two olfactory
pouches are not at all prominent they are placed directly under the
outer maxill homologically in their middle segment just above
a small medial tonguelike apodeme The orifices of the acoustic
sacks appeared to be in their usual position beneath the basal
articulations of the first pair of cirri The vesicul seminales
occupy their usual position in the prosoma they are not much
convoluted they unite before entering the penis The probosciformed
penis is imperfectly ringed it is thick and short and tapers much
more abruptly than is usual it supports a few very thin hairs The
ovarian cca are spread over the basal membrane at the bottom of
the sack hence they in fact lie almost on one side of the animal they
consist of two main trunks proceeding out of the animals body at the
rostral end of the sack which then branch and inosculate In specimens
of V Strmia collected by Mr Peach for me in Cornwall during the
first week of April there were included two ovigerous lamell placed
transversely across the rostral and the carinal end of the sack the
lamell were  of an inch in length they appeared loose and not
attached as in the Lepadid to any ovigerous frna The ova in their
earliest age have one end much pointed and are ths of an inch
in length they become blunter and increase a little in size before
the larv burst forth The larv both during their earliest stage and
after the first moult have been excellently figured and described
by Mr C Spence Bate they present no particular characters distinct
from the larv of other Cirripedes I will only further add that
the structure of the prehensile antenn still adherent to the basal
membrane indicates that the larva in its last stagethat is the
locomotive pupahas a normal character

AffinitiesThese have been sufficiently discussed under the family
I need here only remark that all the species with the exception of V
nexa are intimately allied together

RangeHabitsGeological HistoryThe genus Verruca ranges being
represented by four species from Iceland to Cape Horn The species
that is found in Tierra del Fuego extends up the west coast to Peru
Our northern form V Strmia if I may trust a specimen in the
British Museum apparently ticketed in an authentic manner occurs
also in the Red Sea and this is the only locality in the eastern
hemisphere whence I have seen this genus The species seem generally
to live in rather deep water I procured V lvigata from nineteen
fathoms on the east coast of Patagonia V Strmia is found
according to information given me by Professor Forbes on the British
shores between five and fifty fathoms and on the steep shore off
Mull in ninety fathoms but Mr Thompson assures me that he once
saw it adhering to tidal rocks and likewise to some floating bark
Generally the species are attached to living organic bodies especially
shells of Mollusca and of Cirripedes to Gorgoni and Laminari
less frequently to rocks We shall immediately see that it has slight
powers of excavation This genus is geologically older than any true
sessile cirripede or member of the Balanid V Strmia is found in
the Glacial Deposits and in the Red and Coralline Crag of England
another species in a state not to be identified occurs in the ancient
Tertiary formations of Patagonia and another in the Chalk of England
and Belgium The fact of this Family ascending to a Secondary epoch
accords in an interesting manner with its affinities inasmuch as
though in appearance a sessile cirripede it is almost equally related
to the Lepadid and Balanid and is more nearly related to the
Lepadid than to the Balanin or typical members of the Balanid of
the latter none have hitherto been found in any Secondary deposit
whereas the Lepadid culminated during the Cretacean period


Powers of Excavation

My attention was called to this subject by Mr Hancock whose excellent
researches on the boring of Mollusca are well known Verruca Strmia
when attached to shells destitute of an epidermis excavates as he
informed me a slight depression deepest in the middle but when the
epidermis is present no effect whatever is produced We shall presently
see that the central depression is in some degree distinct from that
of the circumference I have since found Mr Hancocks observations
strictly applicable to V lvigata V Spengleri and to an ancient
tertiary species from Patagonia From having found that the following
cirripedes viz Lithotrya Alcippe and Cryptophialus all form
their deep excavations by mechanical means and from having read the
abovementioned memoirs by Mr Hancock on the boring of mollusca I
was strongly impressed with the idea that the action in Verruca would
likewise prove mechanical but from the following facts I have come to
the conclusion that the excavation must be due to a solvent probably
poured out from the cementducts which debouch on the under side of
the basal membrane

In the first place an epidermis as just stated perfectly preserves
the shells of the various species of mollusca and certain cirripedes
to which I have seen Verruca attached this is well shown by comparing
the effect produced on the same shell in parts covered by the epidermis
and in parts whence it has been abraded or where the shell of the
Verruca had fixed itself whilst very young within a crack in the
epidermis and had subsequently by its growth turned up the edges
and had then acted on the underlying shell whereas the specimens
attached to the sound epidermis had not produced the smallest effect
Again I have seen an epidermiscovered musselshell encrusted by a
hard nullipora on which V lvigata was attached and here the
calcareous nullipora under the middle of the basal membrane was
entirely corroded away whilst the underlying epidermis and the shell
beneath it were not in the least affected The protection afforded
by the epidermis is still more strikingly shown by contrasting shells
with very sharp prominent ridges when thus invested and when naked
to which Verruc have been attached I have given a figure Pl 
fig  of a piece of an invested Venus from the surface of which a
V Spengleri had been just removed on the other hand I have seen a
Peruvian Discina in which even sharper ridges covered by epidermis
were left absolutely untouched although projecting deeply into the
shell of an attached V lvigata I have seen several specimens of
this latter Verruca which has the power of corroding naked shell as
deeply as its congeners attached to the membranecovered variety of
Balanus lvis the shell of which was thus perfectly preserved now
this membrane is little more than the th of an inch in thickness
it is not hard and so brittle that it generally separates with the
Verruca leaving the underlying shell of the B lvis with its
lines of growth glossy and perfect it appears to me impossible that
a membrane so thin and brittle could resist an action if mechanical
which has worn away from twenty to forty times as great a thickness of
hard shell but the thinnest film of any matter on which acid does not
act as of grease in certain forms of printing will perfectly preserve
the underlying substance and as I have ascertained by putting on a
drop of acid is the case with this membrane I have removed several
scores of shells of V Strmia from the stems of Laminari and when
the latter were washed and slightly dried generally not the least
effect could be seen except that the spots where the shell had adhered
were glossy from the still adherent basal membrane yet the stems of
Laminari are far from hard In some cases however the attachment of
the Verruca seemed to have produced a very slight depression on the
Laminaria but this I think may be safely attributed to the growth
of the surrounding surface for I have seen exactly the same effect
produced by the attachment of the discs of the antenn of a Lepas
and these discs with their long spines could not possibly produce
any excavation nor is Lepas or its pupa in any case a burrowing
animal Again I have seen a few specimens of Verruca attached to
Gorgoni and they had not acted in the least on the horny axis I
have examined numerous specimens of V Strmia attached to three
pieces of slaterock and to one piece of red sandstone all from
different localities and no effect whatever had been produced yet
the slaterock especially in one instance was soft Mr Bate to
whom I am indebted for some of these specimens also informs me that
he could discover no impressions on the slaterocks whence specimens
of the Verruca had been removed On the other hand I have had two
specimens of limestone with attached Verruc one coarse and very
impure and the other hard and marblelike and in both cases there was
a distinct central slight cavity including loose gritty matter The
loose particles evidently resulted from the unequal action either of a
solvent or of some mechanical power on the rock for it is improbable
in the highest degree that the shells should have fixed themselves
exactly over small collections of loose particles even if such could
possibly have remained on projecting surfaces of seawashed rocks

The above facts seem to indicate pretty plainly that the excavation
of the support does not depend on its hardness but on its containing
calcareous matter liable to be acted on by some solvent but as this
view considering what we know of Lithotrya and of the two other
burrowing genera of cirripedes to be hereafter described appears
improbable I will add a few additional observations I most carefully
examined the shell and basal membrane of Verruca and likewise the
tissues left after the dissolution of the shell in acid and could
detect no structure at all fitted for boring and what appears more
important there was no apparent difference in the state of the
specimens which had and had not excavated a hollow and this I think
would certainly have been the case as in Lithotrya if the action had
been mechanical It is not easy to ascertain owing to the small effect
at any time produced at how early an age Verruca begins to act on
its support but I found two sets of specimens only th of an inch
in basal diameter which had certainly commenced The ribbed shell
Pl  fig  especially the middle rib shows in a somewhat
exaggerated degree the typical form of the excavation it may be
here seen that the excavation is of the same depth for some little
distance from the circumference towards the centre but that in the
middle it suddenly becomes deeper I have seen several specimens with a
central hollow without any or with scarcely any marginal depression
and likewise the reversed case These several facts show that the
central excavation cannot be due to an equable action prolonged
during the whole growth of the shell having thus affected the middle
more than the circumferential parts for in this case the excavations
would have sloped into each other In specimens which have not at all
acted on their support the whole basal membrane is firmly attached
as in all ordinary cirripedes to the supporting surface but in those
which have acted the middle portion of the basal membrane is quite
unattached and the circumferential portion is I think less firmly
attached than is usual but between these two portions there is a
circular zone strongly cemented to the supporting surface and which
alone keeps the shell in its place Now on the mechanical theory
to account for the circumferential hollow the basal edges of the
shell together with the circumference of the basal membrane must be
subjected to movement but the shell is united to the basal membrane
by corium and by transparent structureless chitine both of which may
be left out of question and by a circle of short fibres which adhere
at their lower ends to the firmly cemented circular zone and by their
upper ends to the shell and these fibres have been very carefully
examined by Professor Quekett and pronounced to be not muscular
but exclusively ligamentous and therefore incapable of moving the
edge of the shell The basal membrane over the central hollow is as
stated quite loose its lower surface formed by a reticulated layer
of horny cementtissue shows no signs of abrasion and the membrane
is so brittle and tender that in specimens which have been once dried
and then well soaked it almost invariably cracks when the shell is
removed owing to its mere adhesion to the delicate inner tunics of
the sack yet on the mechanical theory the wearing of the central
hollow must have been caused by the action of this middle portion of
the basal membrane which it may be repeated is destitute of
muscles From the presence of the prehensile pupal antenn enveloped
in cement nearly in the centre of the basal membrane it is certain
that this spot was originally attached to the supporting surface and
has since been detached from it as moreover the central hollow goes
on increasing in diameter with the growth of the shell it is certain
that the inner edge of the firmly attached circular zone of basal
membrane must likewise continually go on becoming detached it may
then be asked by what force can the basal membrane seeing that it
is united to its own shell above only by fibres of ligament near the
circumference be continually torn away from the underlying support
to which it is strongly cemented On the other hand on the theory
of a solvent slowly poured out from the cementducts its separation
from its support is simply explained It might be supposed that the
calcareous matter when dissolved would not be able to escape from the
central hollow owing to the basal membrane being so firmly cemented
all round it but the attachment is by a reticulated layer of cement
and I infer that it must be permeated by open passages from the fact
of the hollow being often filled in dried specimens by a bubble of
air instead of the basal membrane being pressed closely down into the
hollow as would have been the case had the hollow been hermetically
sealed up I have seen a few instances in which the bottom of the
central hollow was occupied as was remarked to me by Mr Hancock
by a little chalky and gritty matter and in the case of one of the
specimens of calcareous rock before alluded to by coarse grains and
oxide of iron this seems quite compatible with a solvent acting more
readily on certain parts of the rock or shell than on other and less
soluble parts or particles

     Mr Hancock suggests to me that the basal membrane on the
    mechanical theory need not itself move the motion of epithelial
    scales were they transferred into cutting agents might be
    supposed to be sufficient But of such scales though I used very
    high powers I could see no trace and their presence on the under
    side of the layer of cement seems hardly possible Moreover
    according to Von Siebold Anatomie Compare tom  p 
    ciliary action has not been observed in any Crustacean or indeed
    any Articulate animal This same statement is likewise made in
    Annals and Mag of Nat Hist  p  by Dr T Williams

The greatest depth of the central hollow in any specimen seen by me
even measuring from the top of a rib in the case of a ribbed shell
to the deepest point was only th of an inch but considering how
much depressed the shell of Verruca is I have no doubt that this small
gain of space is of service to the animal we must suppose the loose
middle portion of the basal membrane is stretched slightly or splits
and is repaired so as to fit the hollow With respect to the even
much slighter circumferential excavation it barely equals in depth
the thickness of the extreme edges of the walls it must I presume
give strength to the shell when laterally pushed but it certainly
appeared to me that the individuals which had excavated a depression
for themselves could be pried vertically up much more easily than
those which had not acted on their support Finally we must suppose
that the hypothetical solvent is poured out of the cementducts at
the extreme circumference of the basal membrane which is almost
loose and destitute of cement so as to slightly corrode outwards and
downwards the calcareous support the action here then stops and this
rim of basal membrane becomes after a new rim has been formed and
as the shell grows outwards firmly cemented down to the now slightly
excavated surface of attachment but during all the time the solvent
goes on acting in the middle and continues during the whole growth
of the shell to encroach on and dissolve the supporting surface from
under the inner edges of the previously cemented down circular zone of
basal membrane I have discussed this subject at considerable length
as it appears to me an interesting one In this case we have the action
of cili and of respiratory currents to which in the case of
Mollusca so much has been attributed entirely eliminated It is also
an interesting fact that within the same Order we should have some
Cirripedes boring by simply mechanical means and others by a chemical
solvent

     See the previous note to p 

     The solvent may be carbonic acid gas as suggested by Mr C
    S Bate in the case of Mollusca Report of British Association
     p  but here under the basal membrane we cannot have
    the respiratory currents or the ciliary action see note supra
    as likewise suggested by Mr Bate

I have given so full a description of the genus that little remains
to be said under the species Generally the whole shell is covered
independently of the interfolding oblique articulating plates by
narrow longitudinal ridges or folds and by this character alone the
ordinary variety of V Strmia can be distinguished as far as I
have seen from all the other species The shell is white or dirty
yellowishbrown The scutum has the lower articular ridge on its tergal
margin very narrow but somewhat variable in width appearing like a
mere slight shoulder against which the longitudinal axial ridge of
the tergum abuts it is not half as wide as the short upper articular
ridge On the under side there is a very slight depression for the
adductor scutorum muscle There is considerable variation in the degree
to which the transverse ledge on the under side of the fixed tergum
projects and therefore in the depth of the hollow thus formed The
specimens with the rightside and those with the leftside opercular
valves moveable are apparently about equally numerous

The specimen in the British Museum from the Red Sea was attached
to a Gorgonia and was in the same box with a Pyrgomacircumstances
favouring the correctness of the localitybut I am much surprised
from the general distribution of the species that V Strmia should
occur in so distant and isolated an area After careful examination
I can discover no constant difference between the Red Sea and British
specimens

The specimens from the Crag have not their moveable opercular valves
which offer much more important diagnostic characters than the shell
but as far as the latter is concerned no difference whatever can be
perceived from V Strmia

  VERRUCA LVIGATA G B Sowerby Genera of Recent and Fossil

upper articular ridge moveable tergum broader than high with the
upper articular ridge produced into a point

  HabTierra del Fuego Eastern Patagonia nineteen fathoms Chile
  Peru Mus Brit Cuming Stutchbury Darwin attached to shells and
  often to Balanus lvis and psittacus


I can point out no difference in the shell between this species and
V Strmia excepting that its walls seem invariably to be smooth
which is rarely the case with V Strmia perhaps also the oblique
interfolding articular plates between the several compartments are here
more prominent It appears that specimens with the left side uppermost
and therefore with the left opercular valves moveable are considerably
more common than those with the right valves moveable The moveable
scutum and tergum are articulated together by much more prominent
articular ridges than in V Strmia and the two valves together are
broader in proportion to their heightthe height being measured from
the apex to the basal margin In the scutum the lower articular ridge
is considerably broader than the short upper ridge In the tergum the
basicarinal corner is more rectangular and the whole valve is nearly
square owing to the deep furrow receiving the lower articular ridge of
the scutum the axial ridge of the tergum is proportionally narrower
but more prominent than in V Strmia the uppermost ridge formed by
the occludent margin of the valve projects especially when viewed on
the under side fig  b as a moderately sharp point

In the mouth the lower teeth of the mandibles are more distinct than
in V Strmia the lower part of the edge of the maxilla is very
prominent In the second and third pairs of cirri the terminal spines
on the shorter rami are coarsely pectinated on the sixth pair there
are only three pairs of main spines on each segment but these several
points according to the analogy of other species I should expect to
be variable

This species is alluded to by Bruguire in the Encyclopdie
Mthodique but was confounded by him with the V Strmia of Europe




 VERRUCA SPENGLERI Pl  fig 

Moveable scutum with a sharp straight medial adductor ridge fixed
scutum not larger than the fixed tergum

  HabMadeira Mus Lowe attached to shells


It would appear that the present species does not attain quite so
large a size as the more northern V Strmia the walls are not
longitudinally ribbed as is usual with this latter species The
proportional sizes of the compartments seem to be somewhat different
the fixed scutum is either equal to or even smaller than the fixed
tergum instead of being larger as in V Strmia but in young
individuals the proportions are reversed In several specimens the
fixed scutum and tergum together were larger than the carina The
rounded adductor plate of the fixed scutum is extremely large The
lines of growth especially on the moveable opercular valves are
rather more plainly crenated than in V Strmia In the moveable
scutum the lower articular ridge on the tergal margin varies a little
in size and is sometimes larger than in V Strmia but never so
large as in V lvigata and is placed more in the middle of the
tergal margin but by far the most important character by which this
species can be distinguished from all the others is the presence
on the under side of the moveable scutum of a straight prominent
adductor ridge which runs up to and even under the apex of the valve
for it is there slightly hollowed out In the moveable tergum owing
to the medial position of the lower articular ridge of the scutum the
middle of the scutal margin is more hollowed out and the axial ridge
narrower than in V Strmia

In the animals body the only difference which I could perceive was
that the shorter rami of the second and third pairs of cirri were not
so short compared either to the other cirri or to the longer rami of
these same cirri In the second cirrus in a moderatelysized specimen
the segments were six and thirteen in number in the two rami and in
the third cirrus seven and fifteen

Had it not been for the specimen in the British Museum of V
Strmia from the Red Sea I should have concluded from geographical
considerations that V Spengleri probably was the species found
in the Mediterranean and noticed by Spengler Schriften der Berl
Gesell  B  as a small variety of the northern V Strmia
and likewise that it was the Creusia echinoides of Risso Hist Nat
Product de lEurope tom  p   which is certainly a
Verruca but not described with sufficient minuteness to be recognised




 VERRUCA NEXA Pl  fig 

Shell reddish moveable scutum with three strongly prominent
longitudinal ridges besides the articular ridges fixed scutum larger
than the carina with no distinct adductor plate

  HabWest Indies Mus Brit attached to a Gorgonia


This species differs considerably from all the others in the genus
The shell is brownishred tinted yellow it is not at all depressed
like the former species but the walls are almost perpendicular or
even overhang their bases and the summit of the shell consequently
is broad This form may be in part but only in part due to the
attachment on the thin branches of the Gorgonia The umbones of the
compartments are remarkably prominent and sharp Although the parietes
are nearly smooth yet from being so steep they are little seen and
owing to the very prominent but rounded ribs by which the compartments
and opercular valves are articulated together the whole shell has a
strongly ribbed appearance The diameter of the largest specimen was 
of an inch

The rostrum A fig  is patelliformed with the umbo of growth
subcentral but rather above the middle point hence this valve
differently from the carina and differently from the rostrum of the
other species grows not only at its basal margin and on both sides
where opposed to the carina and fixed scutum but also along its upper
margin where opposed to the basal edges of the moveable scutum and
tergum owing to the perpendicularity of this valve the upper part
forms a ledge almost parallel to the orifice of the shell The carina
B is of unusually small size being about only half the size of the
rostrum and scarcely exceeding in size the fixed tergum The fixed
scutum S is large larger even than the carina it is oblong and
its shape is more simple than in the other species this is chiefly
owing to the rostrum articulating with the whole of that margin b
which answers to the basal margin of the moveable valve whereas
in the other species fig  b it curls beyond this margin and
articulates with the very protuberant socalled parietal portion of
the valve Three or four rounded prominent longitudinal ribs exactly
like the homologous ribs on the moveable scutum run from the apex
of the fixed scutum to the basal margin and their extremities form
the teeth by which it articulates as just stated with the rostrum
Its upper articular ridge  is more prominent and placed much
lower down in the suture between it and the fixed tergum than in
the foregoing species The ledge o by which the orifice is kept
neatly closed is here more distinct than in V Strmia this ledge
is necessary as well as in the case of the fixed tergum owing to
the altered shape of the summits of the moveable scutum and tergum
due to their corrosion and to their coming to project freely But the
most remarkable character of the fixed scutum is that on the under
side there is no great adductor plate but a rounded hollow with its
lower edge only slightly prominent the absence of the adductor plate
which is present in all the other species of the genus is no doubt due
to the under side of this valve being inclined even outwards and so
standing in some degree opposed to the moveable valve thus affording
on its under surface a place for the attachment of the lower end of
the adductor scutorum muscle whereas in the other species this muscle
could not possibly have been attached without the aid of an adductor
plate to the under side of the much depressed and sloping fixed
valve The fixed tergum T is a little more simple in form than
the corresponding valve in the other species the two arms answering
to the occludent and carinal margins of the moveable tergum are more
nearly equal in length the internal transverse ledge separating these
rims or margins from the parietal portion of the valve is but little
developed

All four valves forming the shell are remarkable from having when
fullgrown but not whilst young their basal edges abruptly inflected
inwards thus forming a ledge all round the basal membrane as in
Chthamalus intertextus and Hembeli

Moveable ScutumThis is slightly larger in proportion to the
tergum than in the foregoing species it is chiefly remarkable from
the presence of three prominent longitudinal ridges on the main part
of the valve like the two articular ridges on the tergal margin of
these latter the lower one extends down to about the middle of the
tergal margin The moveable tergum is rhomboidal with the whole
carinal portion marked only by lines of growth it is only remarkable
by the upper of the three articular ridges on the scutal margin being
unusually distinct from the occludent margin

With respect to the animals body its several peculiarities have
already been pointed out under the genus The labrum is decidedly
bullate triangular in section with a row of minute beadlike teeth on
the crest the palpi are very narrow and short and do not nearly touch
each other this variation in the structure of the labrum and in the
size of the palpi is very remarkable considering how important in a
classificatory point of view these parts are in all other Cirripedes
In the mandibles there are either two or three main teeth with the
whole lower part of the organ pectinated with sharp spines Cirri
the first pair is not short in the individual examined the two rami
had eleven and twelve segments In the second pair the shorter ramus
was two thirds of the length of the longer ramus the segments being in
number ten and fifteen in the arrangement of the spines this second
pair resembles its homologue in the three other species In the third
pair the two rami are very nearly equal in length having sixteen and
eighteen segments and the segments of the anterior ramus are only a
little thicker and more thickly clothed with spines than those of the
posterior ramus The remaining cirri and the caudal appendages are as
in the other species

  FossilSystme Senonien et Maestrichtien Belgium Mus Bosquet
  in Chalk Norwich Mus J de C Sowerby


M Bosquet has admirably figured and described the several separated
valves belonging to this species and I owe to his great kindness an
examination of some of them In Mr J de C Sowerbys collection
also there is a single specimen attached to a Mollusc with the four
valves of the shell united together but without the two moveable
opercular valves it cannot be positively asserted that this is the
same species with that of M Bosquet but such probably is the case
This is the species to which I alluded in the Introduction to my
Monograph on Fossil Lepadid It is an interesting species from
being the only known Secondary one but in itself it is a very poorly
characterised form and I can point out no important character in the
shell by which it can be recognised The rostrum and carina which are
of nearly equal sizes are locked together by the usual interfolding
plates and likewise to the fixed scutum and tergum but these latter
plates seem to have been less developed in M Bosquets specimen than
in the English The fixed scutum has a large adductor plate which
seems to have been chipped in M Bosquets specimen this valve and the
fixed tergum in all essential respects resemble the same valves in V
Strmia The surface of the shell is very smooth

The moveable scutum has its occludent margin considerably arched
the lower articular ridge is broader than the upper ridge in which
respects it resembles the same valve in V lvigata but the whole
valve is not so broad as in that species There is no adductor ridge on
the under surface The moveable tergum has its upper articular ridge
narrow and slightly produced into a point on the scutal margin in
this latter respect this species also resembles V lvigata but the
whole valve is not so broad in proportion to its height




 Family LEPADID

Cirripedia having a flexible peduncle provided with muscles scuta
and terga when present not furnished with depressor muscles other
valves when present not united into an immoveable ring


This Family has been fully treated of in my former volume published
by the Ray Society and I should here only have alluded to its
existence had it not been for the genus Alcippe which differs in
so many important characters from the other members of the Lepadid
that formerly I did not even suspect that it could belong to this
Family and therefore deferred its examination The genus Alcippe was
discovered well described and illustrated in  by Mr Hancock
to whose very great kindness I am indebted for permission to dissect
and examine his entire stock of this truly remarkable Cirripede In the
classification of the whole class I have not felt so much doubt as
whether I ought to institute a family for the reception of this genus
Alcippe differs from all other Cirripedes putting on one side for the
instant the males and complemental males of Ibla and Scalpellum in
the very singular fact of being destitute of a rectum and anusin
the three segments of the thorax which usually support the second
third and fourth pairs of cirri being without any appendagesin the
fifth and sixth pairs of cirri having their inner or posterior rami
metamorphosed into very singular roughened cushions or buttons which
apparently serve to triturate the foodin the caudal appendages being
muscular and being used conjointly with the cirriand lastly in
the pupa having a lesser number of segments in its abdomen and caudal
appendages than in as far as I have seen any other Cirripede It will
be thought that these characters are amply sufficient to justify the
placing Alcippe in a separate family more especially when the close
general resemblance in the animals body in most of the other members
of the Balanid Verrucid and Lepadid is borne in mind On the
other hand the males and complemental males of Scalpellum and Ibla
must indisputably be considered as members of the Lepadid yet the
male of Scalpellum vulgare and ornatum has no stomach anus or
mouth which is a far more abnormal structure than the absence only of
the anus in Alcippe the cirri also in these same males differ from
the ordinary cirripedial type decidedly more than in Alcippe Again
in the male of Ibla all the cirri excepting the fifth and sixth
pairs are aborted and these two pairs are usually only uniramous
here then we have a decided resemblance to Alcippe Hence if we
might assume that the female Alcippe had partially assumed characters
confined to the males of the other genera it would assuredly stand
amongst the Lepadid Independently of this comparison with the
foregoing males the affinities of Alcippe are so special to several
genera amongst the Lepadid that it seems unnatural to force it out
of the position which it well occupies between Ibla and Anelasma and
place it in another family by itself thus in being bisexual and
in the general character of its very curious males Alcippe shows an
affinity to Ibla and Scalpellum and to the former of these genera it
is related in several particulars such as in the body being lodged
within the peduncle and in the structure of the larval antenn c
to Anelasma and Alepas it is allied in the general character and to a
certain extent in the muscles of the capitulum Anelasma also has
all its cirri to a certain degree rudimentary and Alepas cornuta has
the inner rami of the fifth and sixth pairs of cirrinamely the very
same rami which are so curiously modified in Alcippesmall destitute
of muscles and functionless for their proper purpose to Anelasma
and Lithotrya it is allied in the peculiarity of the lower end of the
peduncle becoming elongated by growth and in being imbedded and to
Lithotrya by its powers of excavation and manner of attachment Now
I believe it generally holds good that when a form is really distinct
from another group its affinities are general or only in a slight
degree special to the members of that group Nor indeed can it be
asserted that Alcippe differs much more somewhat more it certainly
does from the other genera than does Anelasma with its more singular
mouth spineless rudimentary cirri and fimbriated peduncle and I have
never regretted having included this genus amongst the Lepadid Hence
after much consideration I have resolved to consider Alcippe as one of
the Lepadid though so curiously modified and having characters
confined to the males of the other genera Perhaps I have been in some
degree influenced by the difficulty of finding external characters by
which to separate Alcippe as a family from the other Lepadid

     The fossil species have been described in a separate
    Monograph published by the Palontographical Society Since
    its publication M Bosquet has produced an excellent memoir
    containing descriptions with the most beautiful illustrations of
    several new Cretacean species of Pollicipes and Scalpellum The
    memoir is entitled a Monographie des Crustacs Fossiles du Terrain

     Adrien de Jussieu in his Memoir on the Malpighiace
    Archives du Museum tom  p  when speaking of the
    characters afforded by the degraded flowers which in certain
    genera are borne together with ordinary flowers makes the
    following observations bearing on the question here discussed
    viz whether or not to include Alcippe amongst the Lepadid

the above difficulties great as they are are greatly enhanced
for Cryptophialus is certainly allied in a very direct and curious
manner in decided opposition to the remarks just made on special
affinities to Alcippe and yet in all the more important parts of its
organisation and in its metamorphosis it differs so fundamentally
that I have felt myself obliged to form not merely a Family but a
distinct Order for its reception

FEMALE Pl 

I may premise that after the sketch of the leading peculiarities of
Alcippe and after the discussion on its affinities just given under
the Family I think it would be superfluous to institute a full generic
description separately from the following detailed account of this
most anomalous cirripede

General AppearanceThe whole animal is from  to  of an inch in
length of a soft texture colourless or yellowish and lives concealed
in a cavity of its own formation in the shells of certain Gasteropods
This cavity communicates with the water by a narrow fissurelike
orifice Pl  fig  broadest at the posterior end where the
cirri are exserted narrow closed and generally curved at the other
a end the two sides of the fissure b are commonly bordered
by a calcareous inorganic deposit the walls of the cavity are worn
so thin over the peduncle at the narrow end of the fissure that the
orangecoloured ovaria can generally be seen through the shell of the
mollusc and hence there is here a distinct fanshaped stain fig 
on the surface The animal consists of a compressed capitulum without
valves and of a sort of peduncle depressed on its rostral face and
covered with a broad oval thin horny disc We must remember that
in the Lepadid the peduncle does not essentially differ from the
capitulum being only the flexible lower or anterior end of the animal
and is separated from the capitulum only by shape and generally by the
direction of the lines of growth The disc when most regular fig
 H lies in a plane at right angles to the sides of the capitulum
and almost in a line with the orifice leading into the sack but the
peduncle is often very irregular fig  and the disc comes even to
occupy a position nearly parallel to one or the other side of the
capitulum On the carinal side the capitulum is generally separated
from the peduncle by a rather deep fold f in the section fig 
but this depends in some degree upon the state of distension of the
mass of ovarian cca I have given a drawing fig  partly taken
from Mr Hancock of a very regular individual and of an extremely
distorted specimen fig  The distortion I believe is generally
caused by the animal during its excavation breaking into some old
cavity

External StructureThe orifice leading into the sack is about
one third of the total length of the animal its edges or lips are
thickened horny and brownish at the lower end exactly where the
orifice ends the lips are formed from being deeply notched into
two sharp projections a figs    unlike anything occurring
in any other Cirripede The external membrane c fig  of the
lip supports an irregular but nearly straight band of sharp thick
spines of chitine about th of an inch in length together with
a few hairs at the carinal or upper end of the orifice the spines are
largest and most numerous at the other and lower end they decrease in
size and on the two projections a fig  and on the adjoining
parts of the external membrane they graduate into the small dentated
points which cover the whole surface of the animal The inner tunic of
the sack b on each side along the upper half of the orifice is
remarkable from having a moderately broad curved band of short sharp
spines not quite so thick as those on the external surface closely
adpressed together and pointing upwards like the javelins of an
ancient phalanx thus probably preventing the ingress of any intruding
animal This band of spines curves at the upper end conformably with
the shape of the orifice The inner tunic of the sack in this upper
part is yellowish and what is very unusual is thicker than the
external membrane A little way down within the orifice and more
especially in front of an elegant row of hairs on the two sides of the
great labrum there is a band of very fine but stiff hairs ths
of an inch in length pointing upwards and making together with those
on the labrum a hedge barring ingress into the sack

The external membrane over the whole animal excepting the horny
disc which covers the rostral face of the peduncle is very thin and
transparent it is periodically and often moulted as may be inferred
from the many old lines of junction round the edges of the horny disc
it is irregularly and pretty thickly but not so thickly as in fig
 studded with starheaded minute points from  to ths
of an inch in diameter composed of hard chitine seated on a short
footstall and this on a circular yellowish slightly thickened disc
of the general investing membrane appearing like a halo surrounding
each little point These points are directed obliquely upwards There
are none on the horny disc though particularly numerous close to its
margin Their state varies much just after a moult when newly formed
the spines are regularly starheaded with quite sharp rays from two
to six in number with some of them occasionally bifid but these
points or rays soon become blunted and ultimately half the star is
worn away so that the appearance then presented is that of a crescent
with a few blunt points on its convex side At each exuviation the
thickened membrane of the orifice with its strong external spines the
condition of which also varies according to the period elapsed since
the last moult and of course the whole internal tunic of the sack
with its spines and hairs are all moulted together with the external
membrane and the little starshaped points In most specimens a barely
distinguishable band or bar of yellowish slightly thickened membrane
runs from the points a at the lower end of the orifice for some
way obliquely downwards and at the lower end of this bar the weak
adductor scutorum muscle having transverse stri is attached This
bar is often strengthened by a prominent external fold of membrane but
yet it is so flexible and as it is united only to the lower end of the
orifice I can hardly believe that it can by means of the adductor
muscle attached to its opposite extremity have much power in closing
the orifice I believe that this muscle acts simply in narrowing the
whole animal so as to favour its movement within the cavity in which
it is imbedded Owing to this position of the adductor muscle and its
consequent little power in closing the orifice we can understand the
necessity for the defence afforded by the bands of spines and hairs on
the inner tunic of the sack and on the labrum which do not occur in
other Cirripedes

Horny discThe general shape of the disc its irregularity and
position have been already described It never extends as remarked
by Mr Hancock to the extreme lower point of the peduncle upwards it
reaches to a little below the lower end of the orifice It consists of
successive layers of membrane either moderately thick and opaque or
only a little thicker than the general membrane of the body but never
furnished with the little sharp points it increases in size in like
manner as the calcareous valves of other Cirripedes the undermost and
last formed layer extending beyond the others with its edge united
till the next exuviation to the general membrane of the body The disc
is attached at its upper end apparently in the usual way by cement
to the roof of the cavity of the shell in which it is imbedded but
the lower parts of the disc are also slightly and partially attached
chiefly along the lines of growth or exuviation and this I suspect
is effected by an inorganic calcareous deposit anyhow I could not
perceive here any cement or cementducts Beyond the circumference of
the disc the whole animal lies free in its cavity The lines of growth
in the middle part of the disc are generally obliterated by the decay
of the older and outer layers These lines though of course ordinarily
conformable with the general outline of the disc are not always so
for the disc sometimes becomes during growth slightly changed in form
and the animal consequently slightly changed in position sometimes
either one or the other side or the upper end of the disc is left
deserted by the new layers of the growing disc these being formed on
the deserted side of less size or extension instead of larger size as
they normally should be all round the disc

The upper end of the disc is always produced into a projection of not
regular shape but generally hollowed out or embayed in front fig
 and almost always hollowed out on the two sides This projection
stands directly over the adductor muscle b in fig  and on the
exterior surface is generally convex being concave on the under
side for the attachment of several muscles presently to be described
The horny layers are in this part usually thicker than elsewhere The
disc is thus upwardly produced owing apparently to the fissure which
leads into the cavity of the shell of the mollusc becoming during the
process of excavation considerably longer than is necessarythat
is longer than the orifice leading into the sack and consequently
for the protection of the imbedded animal the lower and narrow end
of the fissure is closed on its under side by this upward production
of the horny disc formed of layers of membrane of unusual thickness
A deposition also of lime hereafter to be mentioned gives further
protection

In the bays on each side of the upward production of the horny disc
and likewise a little lower down on its edges and therefore somewhat
protected by lying within the narrow pointed lower end of the fissure
in the shell of the mollusc the shortlived Males Pl  fig 
m are attached often in groups of two three or more together

It may be asked to what part in other Cirripedes does the horny
disc answer Not considering the upward prolongation which has been
developed for a special purpose the disc is irregularly circularis
added to all roundserves for the attachment of the whole animal
to the supporting surfaceis covered on the under surface by a
conformable and parallel mass of ovarian cca and the latter by
the inner tunic of the sack therefore in every character and in
its relation to the other parts of the animal the disc answers to
the end of the peduncle or to the basal cup in Lithotrya or still
more closely to the basis in sessile cirripedes with the important
exception that it lies in a line with the longitudinal axis of the
whole animal instead of at right angles to this axis We know that all
ordinary cirripedes become first permanently attached in their pupal
state by their antenn which are seated on the ventral or rostral
surface near to the anterior end of the body and that from the young
cirripede after the act of metamorphosis being turned vertically
upwards and from the extreme anterior now lower end of the body not
being rapidly developed the surface cemented down or the basis
encroaches almost equally on the dorsal lateral and ventral surfaces
But if we were to suppose the extreme anterior point of the body to be
rapidly developed the surface of attachment or basis without it grew
still more rapidly could not possibly reach the dorsal surface and
would consequently be confined to the ventral or rostral surface I
have not seen the young of the ordinary or female Alcippe soon after
its metamorphosis but in the male the development of the extreme
anterior end of the body is extraordinarily rapid and from analogy we
may fairly conclude that this is likewise the case with the female
Hence I believe that the horny disc answers to the cemented down lower
end of the peduncle in other members of the Lepadid and to the basis
in the Balanid and that it is confined to the ventral or rostral
surface owing to the anterior or lower end of the body having been
rapidly developed To make all the parts internal and external of
Alcippe correspond with those of other cirripedes the main circular
part of the horny disc must be turned up at nearly right angles to its
present position the dorsal or carinal integuments to the righthand
in fig  being shortened and then we should have a peduncle
certainly very short and broad but holding its proper relative
position

     In the genus Lithotrya as long as the animal continues to
    bore into the rock the calcareous discs by which it is attached in
    its cavity stand as in Alcippe Pl  fig  a Darwins
    Monograph on the Lepadid parallel to the longitudinal axis
    but as soon as the animal ceases to bore and the discs become
    converted into a cup they occupy a normal position at right angles
    to the peduncle According to Reinhardt these discs in Lithotrya
    are situated on the carinal or dorsal surface of the peduncle at
    which statement I now feel considerable surprise as undoubtedly
    the pupa must first permanently attach itself by its prehensile
    antenn on its ventral or rostral surface In Anelasma I failed to
    discover any cement or cementducts but I am now strongly inclined
    to believe considering that the extreme lower or anterior end goes
    on growing that the surface of attachment will be found to occur
    as in Alcippe on the rostral surface a little way below the
    orifice

Sack and its MusclesI have already described the curious phalanx
of spines the long fine hairs and thickened condition of the inner
tunic of the sack along the sides of the orifice This inner tunic
is a reflexion from that enveloping the body of the animal in the
usual manner as may be seen in the section Pl  fig  Between
the external membrane and the inner tunic of the sack e there
is of course the usual double fold of corium these two folds being
united by minute transverse ligamentous fibres branched at the two
ends as in other Lepadid Imbedded in the corium there are numerous
longitudinal striless muscles which do not run quite up to the
orifice but to an oblique line beneath it Externally to these muscles
there are as in the other Lepadid fine transverse muscles confined
to the middle part of the animal and running from the carinal margin
more than half way round both sides Attached to the upper notched or
folded end of the orifice g fig  above the upper ends of the
longitudinal muscles there is a fan of rather strong striless
muscles expanding downwards with their lower extremities attached to
the outer membrane of the capitulum these muscles apparently serve to
open the orifice there is a somewhat analogous muscle in Lithotrya
but in no other member of the Family in Cryptophialus however there
is a closely similar muscle Owing to the action of these several
muscles the tissues forming the capitulum and peduncle are according
to Mr Hancock highly contractile

I have stated that the under surface of the upper produced end of
the horny disc is concave and serves for the attachment of several
muscles Of these some run to the basal margin of the great labrum and
no doubt as usual move the whole mouth others as usual run to the
skin between the labrum and the lower end of the orificei e in
fig  between the lower end of the row of fine hairs see fig 
which shows where the basal margin of the labrum is situated and the
lower side of the point a where the orifice terminates others
run obliquely on both sides towards the point of attachment of the
small adductor scutorum muscle b fig  others of considerable
strength and these are more peculiar run and are attached to the
lower end of the orifice a and serve apparently to draw up the
orifice from within the fissurelike cavity in which it lies lodged
others again extend transversely on both sides close beneath the
inner tunic of the sack a little beyond the line whence the ovigerous
frna or branchi arise These transverse muscles lie within the
longitudinal muscles and therefore are quite different from the
exterior transverse muscles which are situated more towards the
carinal portion of the peduncle and capitulum and which are common to
most Lepadid The internal transverse muscles and those running to
the lower end of the orifice are peculiar but we shall hereafter meet
with them even more developed in Cryptophialus

Along the medial carinal line there is between the two layers of
corium the usual circulatory channel On each side of this line on
the inside of the sack there are generally some slight irregular
swellings and sometimes a large extent of the inner surface is
irregularly carunculated with little knobs The sack e in fig 
extends down almost to the basal point of the peduncle d more
especially when the ovarian cca are not gorged with ova

Branchi or ovigerous FrnaWithin the sack on each side of the
body rising not far from the ends of the adductor muscle b there
is a large fillet or fold the two occupy so exactly the position
of the ovigerous frna that I cannot doubt such is their nature
though as happens in the case of some species of Pollicipes they
are destitute of their proper glands and so do not serve for the
attachment of the ovigerous lamell this attachment probably is not
required owing to the protected situation which the lamell hold in
the sack under the animals body and over the ovarian cca From
the unusually large size of these socalled frna I cannot doubt
that they serve as branchi equally well with the plicated folds of
membrane believed to be homologous with the frna in the Balanid
which have by every one been considered as branchi The frna are
broad and truncated at their upper ends their margins are sinuous and
their outer surfaces papillose they run longitudinally down the sack
narrowing as they extend almost to the basal point of the peduncle
and hence are of considerable length they are hidden in the section
fig  by the medial somewhat protuberant mass c of ovarian
cca and partly by the i prosoma

BodyThe body is constructed on the usual type and indeed does
not differ greatly from that of Ibla The labrum is very large its
lower or basal margin is separated by an unusual space capable of
being contracted or folded from the lower end of the orifice of the
sack hence the labrum and whole mouth is placed quite remarkably
near the upper or carinal end of the orifice This upper end of the
orifice I may remind the reader is homologically the posterior end
of the general covering or carapace and all that portion of the whole
animal as the sectional figure  stands below the lower margin of
the labrum on the rostral or ventral surface is formed by the three
anterior segments of the head The main part of the body carrying the
mouth is formed by the great development of that segment of the thorax
which bears the first pair of cirri h here closely adpressed as
usual to the sides of the mouth The lower portion of this segment
forms the prosoma i and has the characteristic outline but is not
much developed On each side of the prosoma an oval space of membrane
is yellowish and is thickened and so gives support to this part of
the body The five succeeding thoracic segments which ought to carry
the five succeeding and posterior pairs of cirri are together of very
small size as in Ibla in comparison with either the prosoma or
the whole anterior part of the animal The segment k which should
have borne the second pair of cirri is considerably longer than the
following segments and is at the same time less distinct owing to an
oval convex shield of thickened membrane on the sides not extending
the whole length of the segment thus causing two transverse creases
which when the thorax is contracted appear like two additional
segments Had this segment borne cirri they would have stood as in
Ibla at a considerable distance from the first pair The segments
l m which should have borne the third and fourth pairs of cirri
are like each other except that the former is rather the longest
The membrane covering all the thorax is surprisingly thin and at the
articulations which are straight and transverse is deeply folded so
that the thorax must be highly extensible to a degree which I have
not seen equalled in any Cirripede except in the males of Scalpellum
vulgare and ornatum The thorax is represented as somewhat extended
in fig  This part of the thorax is amply furnished with striated and
striless muscles for its retraction and protrusion and for lateral
movements The segment m which should have borne the fourth pair
of cirri at first sight falsely appears like the terminal segment
of the thorax in one monstrous specimen it bore a single cirrus
showing if there had been any doubt that it was a true segment
The three terminal pairs of articulated appendages form together a
brush they consist of the fifth and sixth pairs of cirri and of the
caudal appendages my reasons for considering the lastnamed organs
as of caudal origin will be given hereafter A moderately careful
inspection especially of the ventral surface will show that the fifth
pair of cirri are borne on a small segment n fig  but plainer
in fig  which is quite distinct from but partially concealed
by that which ought to bear and did bear in the monstrous case the
fourth pair of cirri this segment is oblique and cannot be traced
distinctly all round the dorsal surface The segment o fig 
bearing the sixth pair is much less distinct and can only be seen by
a longitudinal section or when the cirri are a little separated but
it certainly exists as is likewise shown by the presence of small
apodemes dipping in amongst the muscles between this and the last
segment The posterior or caudal appendages are closely approximated
they are not separated by any fold from the sixth thoracic segment
but appear as if they were articulated on the dorsal surface of the
sixth pair of cirri in exactly the manner usual in the other Lepadid
The segments bearing the fifth and sixth pairs of cirri are highly
oblique to the preceding segments and consequently the cirri which
they support instead of projecting inwards lie like a brush in a
line with the longitudinal axis of the main part of the thorax The
membrane forming the two small oblique terminal segments of the thorax
is strengthened by irregularly shaped plates of thicker and yellowish
membrane

     In the middle the fold is slightly prominent and pointed
    and being most finely villose I for some time looked at this
    projection as a rudiment of the probosciformed penis

MouthThe mouth is constructed on the strictly normal type of the
Family but is peculiar in every part it is remarkable from being
situated so near the upper or posterior end of the capitulum this
being caused by the great length of the labrum and of the space of
body between the latter and the lower end of the orifice The labrum
is a very singular part of the mouth from its vast size and outline
in fig  we have a front view of the mouth of which the whole upper
pointed part consists of the labrum and h h is the first pair of
cirri in fig  we have a lateral view of the labrum with the
surrounding thin membrane of the body aa still adhering to its
edges h is the first cirrus on the near side m the mandible a
little distorted in order to show its tooth marking the position of
the transverse crest of the labrum and of the orifice of the sophagus
b b is the medial longitudinal ridge of the labrum In the Balanin
the labrum forms a mere rim to the back of the mouth consisting of
an inner fold running down the sophagus and of an outer fold both
close together in the Lepadid the folds are separated the outer one
being swollen or bullate and here this structure is carried to even a
greater extreme than in Ibla and its allies The distance between the
transverse crest over the sophagus and the blunt projecting point on
the summit of the medial ridge b b equals twice the longitudinal
diameter of the rest of the mouth The lower margin on each side of
the labrum is produced into two projections fig  the longer
one curling round to a point beneath the jaws with its extremity
imbedded as an apodeme Another very peculiar character in the labrum
prominently noticed by Mr Hancock is caused by a longitudinal row
on each side of closely approximate long very finely pointed hairs
which as already stated are fronted on the opposed internal surface
of the sack by an irregular band of still finer hairs The surface
of the labrum is partially covered by minute toothed scales and
these seen on the longitudinal medial ridge b b give it a finely
denticulated structure At each end of the transverse crest which
overhangs the sophagus there is a knob such as occurs on the labrum
of every Cirripede United to these two knobs which are formed of
thick and yellowish membrane and springing from the adjoining sides of
the mandibles there are two swellings formed of thin membrane fig
 which occupy the exact position of the palpi and may be considered
as these organs in a rudimentary condition and destitute of bristles

The mandibles are simpler than in any other Cirripede they are
minute they consist of an oblong plate with only one very strong
tooth at the upper end the face towards the labrum is swollen beneath
the upper free part there is a small subtriangular piece of thickened
membrane let in and forming part of the general outer surface of
the mouth and representing the large square plate found in other
Cirripedes The maxill fig  are smaller but broader than the
mandibles they have an upper tooth and a smaller lower one lying not
quite in the same plane with the upper one but nearer the mandibles
The apodeme fig   is of remarkable length extending beneath
the basal fold of the mouth it does not arise from the ridge or outer
edge of the maxilla but a little on one side from the face directed
towards the mandible Between maxill and mandibles there is a very
singular prominent fold of membrane fig   which resembles
but probably falsely the supposed rudimentary palpus attached to the
mandible Altogether the maxill differ considerably from the same
part in other Cirripedes In structure they seem adapted to assume
the function of mandibles but they do not stand directly over the
sophagus The outer maxill fig  appear like a minute deeply
notched lower lip each consists of a simple oblong rounded plate
with a few small bristles at its upper end The basal fold of the
mouth in front beneath the outer maxill is distinct and runs in a
line with the basal articulation of the first pair of cirri In the
rudimentary palpi minute and little developed outer maxill and in
the inner maxill taking the function of the mandibles the mouth of
Alcippe presents some resemblance with that of Anelasma

CirriThese consist of the first fifth and sixth pairs the other
pairs are absent except in one monstrous specimen in which there was
a fourth cirrus quite like the fifth First pair fig  these are
seated on each side of the mouth in the usual position They are formed
of very thin and flexible membrane The pedicel as usual consists of
two segments the upper one is short and not very distinct but when
viewed on the inner side can be seen to have the ordinary structure
both segments are destitute of bristles There are two short rami
being about one third of the length of the pedicel they are directed
either in the line of the pedicel or more commonly posteriorly that
is towards the other cirri and therefore in an unusual direction The
anterior ramus is generally rather longer and thinner as is commonly
the case with other Cirripedes than the posterior ramus but there is
some variation in this respect On neither ramus is there any trace
of the ordinary articulations both are thickly clothed with fine
bristles which are singular from being thickened in their lower parts
and plumose like a feather These cirri have some resemblance as
remarked by Mr Hancock to a pair of pincers but they cannot act as
such they serve I believe as brushes Delicate muscles transversely
striated enter and are attached within both rami and within both
segments of the pedicel on the usual type showing that these organs
if there had been any doubt are truly cirri

The fifth and sixth pairs of cirri fig  n o are almost
exactly alike they are of very small size each cirrus consists of
four segments the lower or basal segment is broad with a few minute
bristles scattered on its inner surface the second segment is also
broad but shorter with a few generally hooked bristles in two short
irregular rows in the upper part these two segments answer to the
two segments of the pedicel of ordinary cirri The third segment is
thinner and longer than the second it bears two or three longitudinal
rows of bristles most of which are neatly hooked at the point its
upper end is surrounded with a circle of bristles The fourth and
terminal segment is short thin and simple with only a few bristles
at the apex These two upper segments are bent a little inwards they
answer to one of the two normal rami of ordinary cirri The third
segment does not stand exactly on the middle of the summit of the
second segmentthe posterior corner of the latter being occupied by
a very curious convex oblong rather hard especially in the lower
part protuberant cushion as called by Mr Hancock or button fig
 c transversely wrinkled by fine distinctly crenated ridges
This button presents a considerably different appearance according to
the point of view fig   on one of its sides it projects beyond
the outline of the second segment whence it arises on the other
side it is prolonged as a smooth ridge on the top of the second
segment embracing to a certain extent the base of the third segment
On the face opposite to that which has been drawn fig  as most
characteristic it is seen to be somewhat constricted round its base
this constriction representing I believe an articulation When
viewed directly in front fig  its outline is oval passing into
shieldshaped Its longitudinal axis is ths of an inch in length
but it varies a little in shape and size I shall presently assign my
reasons for believing that these buttons are the posterior or inner
rami of the fifth and sixth pairs of cirri in a rudimentary and much
modified condition

Caudal AppendagesThese fig  p are placed close together
being articulated between the bases of the sixth pair of cirri the
lines of junction being internally marked by minute apodemes They
consist of four segments resembling in every respect those forming the
cirri with the important exception that there is not a vestige of the
button on the summit of the second segment the segments are not so
thick as those of the cirri and the terminal segment is smaller

Muscles and Functions of the CirriFor their size the cirri and
caudal appendages have voluntary muscles of remarkable strength
attached within their basal segments and springing from the dorsal and
ventral surfaces of the socalled third and fourth l m thoracic
segments Other muscles rising from within the basal segment of each
limb run to the second segment and from that to the third segment
I could not distinctly make out whether any entered the terminal
segment I have seen no other instance of muscles entering the caudal
appendages but as in the pupa they are so furnished we here have only
an embryonic character preserved I may remark that the fifth and sixth
cirri consisting of two large basal and two thinner terminal segments
is likewise an embryonic character From the position of the cirri the
four hard protuberant buttons or cushions tend to oppose each other
at a common point and the caudal appendages fill up a gap behind
between the cirri of the sixth pair I at first thought with Mr
Hancock that these buttons served to catch the prey but reflecting
on their convexity and hardness they appear very badly adapted for
this purpose it would in fact be a marvellous feat to secure in
the dark any moving object between four balls On the other hand
this very convexity the hardness and especially the crenated ridges
and the powerful muscles which from the first surprised me are all
well explained if we suppose the prey being secured by the terminal
segments to be triturated between these four balls any part which
escaped upwards would moreover be retained in a sort of cage formed
by the inwardly inflected terminal segments with their hooked spines
This view of the very curious and unparalleled use made of a modified
portion not of the haunch but of an upper part of the two posterior
pairs of thoracic limbs is in some degree confirmed by finding that
Cryptophialus which has apparently analogous habits requires its food
to be triturated though in this case it is effected by very different
means namely by four beautifully toothed discs with brushes of
hairs developed within the lower end of the sophagus

The prey when caught would probably at once be carried by the
movement of the articulated thorax to the mouth itself moveable
and being there secured by the mouth in front the caudal appendages
behind the tips of the cirri above and the broad pedicels of the
first pair on the two sides it would be triturated by the four
crenated buttons and would then be forced down the sophagus by the
action of the simple jaws I looked in vain in several specimens for
any object within the stomach I believe that when the specimens are
first taken all half digested food is ejected by the mouth Whether we
may thus account for the extremely foul condition of the rami of the
first cirri in all the many specimens examined by me I know not but
that these rami which are thickly clothed with fine plumose hairs and
are furnished with delicate muscles act as brushes so as to clean the
orifice of the sack I can hardly doubt

HomologiesI have as yet to a certain extent assumed that I have
correctly named the different parts and a few remarks on this head may
be desirable considering the absence of certain cirri the singular
condition of the others the close general resemblance of the cirri
and caudal appendages and the fact of the latter being furnished with
muscles The only cause for any doubt regarding the thoracic segments
is the shield of thick membrane on that segment k fig  which
ought to have borne the second pair of cirri causing two transverse
wrinkles not distinguishable however on the ventral surface
and sometimes making the segment appear as if it consisted of three
segments if it did consist of three as there can be no doubt about
the nature of the first pair of cirri not in a more rudimentary
condition than in Anelasma or about the segment whence this first pair
arises the two terminal oblique segments with their appendages would
be abdominal instead of thoracic but this is improbable inasmuch as
the abdomen is unusually little developed in the pupa as presently to
be shown and more especially from the circumstance of a monstrous
cirrus identical in structure with the two succeeding pairs having
been borne on a segment m which in any case must be considered as
thoracic for it is well known how very rarely thoracic and abdominal
limbs resemble each other I cannot myself feel hardly any doubt on the
nature of these three pairs of appendages for in the first place
the posterior appendages are articulated on and between the bases of
the adjoining pair exactly as the undoubted caudal appendages are
articulated in all other members of the family on the sixth pair of
cirri or terminal thoracic appendages Secondly we see in the male
of the allied genus Ibla the very same appendages preserved as in
Alcippe namely the caudal and the fifth and sixth pairs of cirri
which latter moreover are generally uniramous Thirdly and lastly
in the likewise allied Alepas cornuta we have the posterior rami of
these same fifth and sixth pairs of cirri in a rudimentary condition
and resembling in every respect the caudal appendages Assuming
then that the several appendages in Alcippe have been rightly
denominated we have to consider the nature of their segments in all
cirripedes the pedicels of the cirri consist of two segments of
which the lower one as here is longer than the upper one and both
as here considerably thicker than the segments of the rami in all
cirripedial pup likewise the thick pedicels of the limbs consist of
two segments and each ramus also as here of two segments now
with these coincidences and bearing in mind that in Alcippe the two
upper segments do not arise from the exact middle of the summit of the
second segment but from rather its anterior sidebearing also
in mind the case just cited of Alepas cornuta with the posterior
rami of these very same cirri rudimentarywe may I think safely
conclude that here in Alcippe the two lower segments form the pedicel
the two upper segments the anterior ramus and that the buttonlike
protuberance is the posterior ramus in a modified condition As the
caudal appendages in none of the Lepadid either in the mature state
or in the pupa have two rami we can satisfactorily understand the
absence of any trace of the buttonlike protuberance on the top of the
second segment

     I almost wish I could persuade myself that I had taken
    an erroneous view of the thoracic segments and therefore that
    the three pairs of terminal appendages were all abdominal for
    then Alcippe would come into much closer relationship with
    Cryptophialus though even in that case it would form a distinct
    family from it but I cannot alter my opinion

Alimentary CanalThe sophagus runs down from the mouth beneath
and nearly parallel to the straight row of hairs on the two sides of
the labrum it is surrounded by the usual muscles at the lower end it
bends down and expanding a little like a bell enters the stomach
The stomach is of considerable size and fills the main part of the
body bulging out under the mouth and prolonged as far as about the
middle of that segment l which ought to have borne the third pair
of cirri here the stomach terminates in a blunt rounded point The
tissue surrounding the stomach and keeping it in its proper place can
be traced to the posterior end of the thorax but there is no rectum or
anus I am prepared to assert positively that this is the case
for I made repeated longitudinal sections of the whole thorax in two
planes and I subsequently cleaned the outer tissues with boiling
potash and then when as transparent as a sheet of glass I examined
every part and certainly there is no rectum which in every case
is formed of chitine and so is not acted on by potash nor an anal
orifice Singular as this fact is it is not so improbable as it at
first appears inasmuch as I have shown in my former volume that the
Lepadid can reject half digested food by their mouth and secondly
that the final stage of digestion appears to take place in the upper
part of the stomach In the male of this very species as we shall
immediately see there certainly is no mouth or stomach and apparently
no rectum or anus so is it likewise with the males of Scalpellum
vulgare and ornatum in Proteolepas there is a mouth and an
sophagus but no stomach rectum or anus There are I believe no
other known instances in the whole great class of Crustacea of the
absence of an anus

     I may venture to remark that I succeeded in every attempt
    which I made in seeing plainly the sophagus and the acoustic
    and olfactory orifices and sacks which according to all analogy
    would be of much smaller size and far more difficult to discover
    than the rectum and anus I may mention that according to Mr
    Newport Annals of Nat Hist  p  the larv of
    certain parasitic Hymenoptera have a stomach without any anus
    No crustacean according to Milne Edwards is destitute of this
    orifice

The stomach in Alcippe is much corrugated so as to be deeply
pitted but there are no regular cca The enveloping hepatic layer
is thick brownish pulpy and formed of pellets of cellular matter
not distinctly arranged in lines as is general there is the usual
delicate muscular layer The stomach was in every case empty and I did
not notice the separated epithelial coat so generally found in other
cirripedes

Organs of SenseI failed in discovering the eye which I have no
doubt exits as it is conspicuous in the pupa and in the male The
olfactory pouches are seated rather laterally under the maxill as in
Ibla As in this same genus the acoustic sack is seated remarkably
low down fig  at a very considerable distance beneath the basal
articulation of the first cirrus the orifice is seated on a slight
prominence the acoustic vesicle I believe is subcylindrical with
irregular projections I did not make out anything distinctly on the
nervous system

Female Generative SystemThe animal we have thus far described
is exclusively female when a longitudinal section of the thorax is
made and the stomach removed it can be most plainly seen that there
are no vesicul seminales or testes Mr Hancock has remarked on the
absence of the usual probosciformed penis The male of Alcippe will
be subsequently described in detail The female organs differ in no
respect from those of other members of the family excepting in so
far that the layer or mass formed by the ovarian cca c does not
lie transversely to the longitudinal axis of the whole animal but
longitudinally under the horny disc The ovigerous frna are largely
developed but serve as previously stated as branchi and not for
their proper function of giving attachment to the ovigerous lamell
The ovigerous lamella is single and nearly corresponds in size and
shape as would ensue from the manner of its formation to the under
side of the horny disc The ova are broadly oval and rather above
th of an inch in length

MetamorphosesThe larva in the first stage has been fully described
and figured by Mr Hancock it differs in no essential respect from
other larv of the family Mr Hancock overlooked the inferior minute
antenn With respect to the larv in the last stage or pupa I
obtained several specimens attached to the disc of the female and
which were on the point of being developed into males and another
specimen identical in all respects but attached independently to the
shell of the mollusc and which therefore I have every reason to
suppose would have been developed into a female In any case these
pup may be conveniently here described Pl  fig  They are
 of an inch in length they are of the usual shape with the
anterior end not very blunt and the posteroventral surface somewhat
produced The whole carapace or shell is very thin and smooth There
are six pairs of thoracic natatory legs situated far back towards the
posterior end of the body each leg has the usual articulations and
the two rami their usual long but not plumose spines the presence of
the legs deserves notice considering the rudimentary and modified
state of their homologues in the mature animal The abdomen differs
considerably from the same part as far as I have seen in other
pup it consists of only a single almost globular fig  q
segment instead of three segments and the two caudal appendages
r are very long and are composed each of only a single segment
instead of two carrying at its tip two short spines There are two
purple eyes ths of an inch in diameter which after having
been dried and then soaked could be seen to be compound they are
fixed in the usual manner to two rather short apodemes which latter
have their usual origin But the pupa has a very unusual appearance
owing to the presence of a single dark purple eye half the diameter
of the two larger eyes situated behind and above the latter and
quite disconnected with the apodemes this is the eye of the mature
animal which for some reason is here developed earlier than usual
The prehensile antenn are remarkable from being seated very close to
the anterior extremity owing to this the articulation of the second
or main segment with the basal segment is hardly at all oblique
The whole pupa is of exactly the same length as the pupa of Ibla
quadrivalvis and so are the antenn see p  of my volume on
the Lepadid viz th of an inch but the second segment is
narrower being only ths in breadth in the broadest part and
is longer in proportion for the disc which forms part of the total
length is only ths in length whereas in Ibla it was ths
the disc is here hoofshaped as in Ibla The ultimate segment is
remarkably short and narrow being only ths in width and less
than half the size of that in Ibla it carries I believe three
terminal spines and is not notched Altogether the antenn more nearly
resemble those of Ibla than of any other genus in the family From the
position of the antenn and from the length of the second segment the
pupa when cemented by the disc or third segment to the supporting
surface adheres with its posterior end almost vertically upwards
With respect to the young cirripede within the pupa I could only
observe that its anterior end was formed into a blunt point

Powers of Excavation Inorganic Deposit of Calcareous Matter
AttachmentAlcippe according to Mr Hancock attacks only dead
shells of the Fusus and Buccinum and always on their inner sides
especially on the columella The excavations in the specimen which I
examined were so numerous as almost to touch and sometimes to run
into each other the included animal being thus rendered distorted The
orifices are directed with respect to the shell indifferently upwards
or downwards From the shape and size of the cavity corresponding
to that of the included animal there can be no doubt as stated by
Mr Hancock that Alcippe forms its own cavity That the action is
mechanical I think may safely be inferred from the whole outer membrane
being studded with minute starheaded points of hard chitine which
rise from halolike little discs of thickened membrane which latter
are well adapted to allow the underlying adherent muscular layer to
act on the points and thus on the surrounding shell Consequently
the points generally show signs of severe attrition but they are
periodically and often replaced at each exuviation by new and much
sharper points There are no points on the permanently attached layers
of the horny disc but it particularly deserves attention that the
renewable membrane always extends beyond the circumference of the
disc and is there most thickly studded with the points We have
met in Lithotrya with a precisely analogous fact in the extension
of the periodically moulted membrane of the peduncle furnished with
starheaded points of chitine and in addition with minute calcareous
beads which however seem soon worn away beyond the calcareous
discs by which this cirripede is attached in its cavity We need not
feel much surprise at points of chitine being hard enough to wear away
shell when we consider what work the jaws of insects likewise formed
of chitine will effect

With respect to the first commencement of the excavation the pupa
owing to the position of its prehensile antenn fixes itself with its
posterior end almost vertically upwards and the young cirripede after
its metamorphosis from the greater length of the ventral integuments
formed round the eyeapodemes must be thrown backwards into nearly
the position represented in Pl  fig  b I have not seen a
young female at this early age but I have traced the development of
several males and have found that the lower end of the peduncle
i e what was the anterior end of the pupa grows at quite a
remarkable rate so as very soon to form a great bag extending beyond
the attached prehensile antenn Now if we suppose an analogous
structure in the female or ordinary Alcippe and the supposition is
quite allowable we shall almost immediately have the anterior or lower
end of the young cirripede just in advance of its antenn pressing
against the surface of the shell of the mollusc and if armed with
triturating points as we have every reason to believe it is it would
wear for itself a cavity The horny disc on the ventral surface of
this protuberant anterior end of the young animal will we may assume
soon become cemented to the near side of the cavity just supposed to
have been excavated And the whole animal by further slight changes
in direction namely by working down more and more obliquely will
take as shown at c its final position As the whole surface of
the animal with the exception of the horny disc is provided with
triturating points the animal when once imbedded can and does
increase its cavity at both ends in length in depth and all round
the edges of the horny discin short in every direction excepting
directly over the horny disc I believe as already explained that the
young Alcippe b diagram first bores obliquely into the shell
and whatever amount of downward extension the horny disc attains before
the young cirripede assumes its proper position with its ventral
surface upwards and parallel to the inner surface of the shell of the
mollusc that amount determines the thickness of the plate of shell
hereafter to be left unabraded over the horny disc as the latter
continues to extend in circumference This plate of shell over the
horny disc is so thin that as mentioned at the commencement the
colour of the ovaria is seen through and until I reflected on the
following considerations I was much surprised how the instinct of
the animal could so neatly guide it not to grind too deeply and yet
to grind till only a very thin plate of shell was left over its horny
disc these considerations are that whatever thickness was first
given to this plate of shell when the animal was very young and first
assumed its ultimate position that thickness would in most cases be
always retained owing to the flatness of the disc and to the membrane
armed with triturating points protruding very slightly beyond and
above the horny disc only just enough to wear away the surrounding
shell to the thickness necessary to allow of the formation of each new
zone of disc as the disc itself is not armed it subsequently has
no power of wearing away the plate of shell above it Thus the horny
disc besides giving support and attachment to the peduncle is of this
peculiar service that it seems to guide somewhat like the woodpart
in a plane the rasping powers of the lower extreme margin of the
peduncle

I may here observe that certain radiating and often punctured lines
mentioned and figured by Mr Hancock which help to render the thin
plate of shell over the peduncle conspicuous fig  are formed by
the burrows of an excessively minute annelid the punctures being
apparently the exit orifices I imagine that these annelids find it
difficult to commence their burrows on the smooth surface of the shell
and that they congregate at these particular spots and thence burrow in
radiating lines owing to their having taken advantage of the little
clifflike edges at the narrow and disused ends of the fissures
leading into the cavities occupied by the Alcippe where alone they
would not be disturbed by the action of the cirri when first they
commenced making their little burrows in the shell

The fissure leading into the cavity is required to be broad at the
posterior end in order that the cirri may be there freely exserted
out of the sack and narrow in other parts to prevent as it would
appear anything injurious getting in between the animals body and
the cavity in the shell of the mollusc As the fissure is increased in
length by attrition at the broad posterior end which end during growth
becomes broader and broader the lower part of the fissure has to be
narrowed and this is effected in a very singular manner namely by
advantage being taken of the strong tendency which triturated shell
with animal matter has to set into a solid shelly mass although
constantly agitated Mr Hancock noticed this edging of hard
shelly matter and naturally thought it was a secretion Lines of
deposition Pl  fig  b parallel to the edges of the furrow
can often be perceived in it its thickness and extension vary much I
have seen it on one side alone of the orifice it is of course never
found at the broad end where the process of enlargement goes on The
peculiar worn surface with which it irregularly thins away downwards
on the sides of the cavity made me together with the apparent
impossibility of such a secretion proceeding from an animal wholly
invested by a chitine membrane suspect it to be inorganic and this
view is certainly correct for when a fragment is dissolved in acid
a considerable residuum is left of bits of membrane rubbish and in
one instance even of the remnants of a foreign animal apparently an
annelid We have here all the circumstances favorable for inorganic
deposits of this nature namely finely triturated shell and chitine or
animal matter produced by the excavation of the chamber seawater
and movement

     I have given some remarkable cases in my volume on Volcanic
    Islands p  in which limestone having almost the hardness
    and specific gravity of marble has been thus deposited Almost
    every coralreef offers similar examples The curious substance
    described by Mr Horner and Sir David Brewster Philosoph
    Transact  p  which is formed during the manufactory of
    cloth offers another example of the strong tendency which lime and
    animal matter have to unite Lately Dr Horsford in Sillimans
    North American Journal Jan  has discussed the chemical
    theory in an analogous case on the coast of Florida he attributes
    the aggregation to the formation of a hydrate of lime through
    the action of the animal matter Mr G B Sowerby Junr has
    described a case very analogous to that of Alcippe Proceedings
    of Zoolog Soc Mollusca Pl  fig  p   namely
    that of Pholas calva in which a tube is formed of inorganic
    calcareous matter serving to narrow the entrance

From the manner of growth of the animal the fissure leading into the
cavity in the shell becomes much longer than the orifice leading into
the sack and to prevent the body being unnecessarily exposed the
upward projection of the disc already described is formed under the
narrow and disused end of the fissure moreover the two rims of the
inorganic calcareous deposit sometimes here approach so closely as
almost or actually to touch each other and between them as remarked
by Mr Hancock there is usually a little accumulation of grains of
sand This narrow end of the fissure is generally curled either to the
right or left hand and I can only account for this fact by supposing
that whilst the cirripede is young and has not a large horny disc
attached to the cavity it cannot keep its body straight during the
longcontinued boring process

The animal is attached by its horny disc to the thin shelly roof over
the peduncle and likewise to the under side of the narrow end of the
fissure but is elsewhere quite free I carefully examined the disc
in many specimens but could not see any cementducts I believe I
saw layers of cement at the upper end of the disc but it is not easy
to discriminate between this substance and the yellowish somewhat
disintegrated layers of the horny disc The pupa certainly becomes
attached by ordinary cement so that the attachment in early life
at least is normal In some fullgrown specimens I found the lower
parts of the horny disc attached along the edges of the layers to the
roof of shell and as I looked here in vain with the highest powers
for cementducts or for cement it appears to me probable that the
rough edges of these layers were united to the roof by a thin layer of
the inorganic calcareous deposit The animal from its very protected
situation certainly requires to be less firmly cemented than other
cirripedes and even in Lithotrya which is less deeply imbedded
than Alcippe the cementing apparatus was feebly developed From the
length of the pupal antenn cemented by their terminal segments the
position of the young cirripede Pl  fig  can be changed to
a considerable extent like a ship swinging at her moorings but in
order to assume its final position the animal must I think travel
like Lithotrya but to a much less extent by a short succession of
overlapping horny discsthe old discs being partially deserted each
new one extending beyond the lastformed one even in the case of the
mature animal we have seen that under certain circumstances it
changes to a certain extent its position portions of the old disc
being deserted and attached to the roof of a deserted portion of the
cavity

AffinitiesIn the preliminary remarks under the Family I have
discussed this subject almost sufficiently I will here only remark
that the genus though so abnormal yet stands naturally between
Ibla and Anelasma having clear affinities on the one side through
and beyond Anelasma to Alepas and on the other side beyond Ibla to
Scalpellum and so to Lithotrya Moreover it is very distinctly
related to Cryptophialus in the succeeding Order


MALE Pl 

On every specimen of the female Alcippe which I carefully examined
I found some minute parasites or epizoons attached to the lateral
edges of the upper part of the horny disc and therefore lying within
the narrow end of the fissure leading into the chamber excavated in the
shell of the Buccinum Although having had some experience in the very
anomalous forms which male cirripedes assume yet when I first casually
inspected these parasites under a weak lens from their transparency
their elongated and lobed body including an internal folded up organ
I actually threw them away thinking that they were probably Bryozoa
Subsequently a more careful inspection immediately showed the cemented
prehensile antenn and their cirripedial nature was demonstrated I
soon found specimens with the perfect still adherent exuvi of the
locomotive pupa undistinguishable from the pupa already described as
probably belonging to the female Alcippe But as this latter fact
may perhaps be doubted I must show that there is other evidence
sufficient to prove that these cirripedial parasites are the males of
the female Alcippe Of the females I inspected many specimens and all
certainly were without external male organs and in the four or five
specimens which I rigidly examined there were no testes or vesicul
seminales the latter being in all hermaphrodite and male cirripedes so
conspicuous On the other hand I examined at least thirty specimens
of the parasite and they were all exclusively males for all had
a probosciformed penis and the greater number had their vesicul
seminales filled with spermatozoa and hence were ready to perform the
act of impregnation but undoubtedly they contained no ova It would
then be very strange if these two cirripedes of opposite sexes thus
attached together were not sexually related Wonderfully different as
the parasite is from the female Alcippe yet in one very important
character it is related to Alcippe and to no other member of the
Family namely in the sack extending down to the extreme lower point
of the peduncle the male organs I may add occupying an analogous
position with the peculiar position of the female organs in Alcippe
The lateral lobes of the peduncle in the parasite seem to represent
the sides of the broad depressed peduncle in Alcippe and in both the
peduncle grows at its lower enda very rare circumstanceobserved
only in two genera in this Family namely in Anelasma and in a
slight degree in Lithotrya Besides these points of resemblance
between Alcippe and its parasite which are striking considering
their external utter dissemblance the affinities of both point
judging from certain small characters in the same direction namely
towards Ibla and Alepas Finally then I think we may confidently
admit that this parasite or epizoon is the male of the female Alcippe
indeed considering the facts given in my former volume on Ibla and
Scalpellum I have perhaps here discussed the question at unnecessary
length

The males are generally attached as already stated to the two
hollowed out sides of the upward prolongation of the horny disc they
adhere by means of little patches of cement proceeding from the
terminal segments of their antenn to the overlapping edges of the few
laterformed zones of the disc hence they lie protected within the
narrow end and a little under the edges of the fissure leading into the
cavity in which the female is lodged In some specimens however the
males are attached rather lower down on the disc and are not confined
exclusively to its upper margin so that they live fairly under the
roof of shell which covers the main part of the disc but they are
never attached very low down so as to lie far from the lower end of
the orifice leading into the sack of the female I have two or three
times seen as many as three males on each side but sometimes there is
only one on each side or none on one side A large distorted specimen
actually had twelve males and two pup on the point of undergoing
their final metamorphosis all fourteen attached on one side and all
evidently must have been alive together Another specimen had nearly
the same number a few on one side and the rest on the other side

The male immediately after the exuviation of the pupal carapace
th of an inch in length is only th of an inch long
but ultimately it becomes chiefly from the growth of the lower end
of the peduncle nearly twice this length for the largest specimen
which I have seen that figured was th of an inch long i
e under th of an inch and th of an inch in breadth across
the peduncle beneath the lateral lobes The whole external membrane
of the animal as well as the internal membrane of the sack is very
thin quite structureless and as transparent as glass hence even
the spermatozoa within the vesicula seminalis can be seen from the
outside The whole structure of the animal is very simple The ventral
surface can be at once recognised by the attachment of the antenn
fig  a and these organs mark the point which was the anterior
end of the male just at the period of its metamorphosis and before
the lower end of the peduncle had grown These antenn have already
been fully described they are conspicuous from being composed of
membrane rather thicker than that investing the body of the male
and which external membrane can be traced entering these organs and
appearing like cementducts but within these tubular prolongations of
the outer membrane I could obscurely see the real cementducts

The part answering to the capitulum is much flattened and elongated
it widens but little from the upper to the lower end where it blends
with the carinal or dorsal surface the under surface in fig 
of the lobed peduncle At the upper end there is a small orifice
and close to this on the ventral or rostral side there is a thin
apparently double projection i fig  or flap of membrane one
flap lying exactly over the other The whole length of this capitulum
probably corresponds with that small portion of the capitulum in the
female between the upward prolongation of the horny disc and the
lower end of the orifice and the two broad flattened projections in
the male probably answer to the two sharp narrow points a fig 
Pl  in the female The peduncle has two lateral lobes h g
fig  and whilst young what may be called a third and medial
lobe but this soon increases largely by growth and forms the main
part of the peduncle The lateral lobes are intimately connected with
the ventral surface they tend to lie in a plane at right angles
to the compressed capitulum but owing to the excessive thinness
and flexibility of the whole external membrane it is difficult to
ascertain the relative position of the different parts Moreover owing
to the pupa being so much flattened these lobes are necessarily formed
folded up and I believe it depends on the position with respect
to surrounding objects which the male ultimately holds whether the
lobes ever assume their apparently normal position in a plane at
right angles to the sides of the pupa owing also to the form of the
pupa the two lobes seem generally to be actually formed of unequal
sizes that formed in the dorsal region of the pupa being the largest
I believe that these lobes correspond with the lateral margins of
the upper end of the peduncle of the female which margins project
laterally beyond the sides of the capitulum The lower lobe or end
of the peduncle is depressed in the same plane with the lobes it is
of variable length when first formed it hardly extends beyond the
basal articulation of the prehensile antenn Commonly it does not lie
quite in a straight line of the capitulum and I have seen specimens
in which it stood at nearly right angles to the capitulum and to what
was the ventral surface of the pupa this irregularity in the relative
position and sizes of the different parts of the peduncle no doubt
to a considerable extent depends on the form of surface to which the
male becomes attached just in the same way as we have seen that the
peduncle of the female becomes altered in shape during the excavation
of the chamber in which it is lodged

I feel some difficulty on one point in the pupa the single eye of the
future male can be clearly distinguished and it lies some way from
the anterior end of the body but in two males which certainly had
just moulted and in which none of the internal organs were as yet
developed the eye lay close to the anterior end directly over the
basal articulation of the antenn I suspect this is somehow caused by
the great change of form which supervenes during the metamorphosis
at this anterior end of the body the extremely compressed body of the
pupa having to become depressed and lobed in the young male I have
given a figure of a young male just as it appeared Pl  fig 
somewhat distorted from lying on a flat surface c being the eye

The sack extends in a very remarkable manner down to the lower end
of the peduncle the whole inside of the animal being thus freely open
to the water In the upper part the sack forms a mere narrow tube it
does not appear to have been formed in the same manner as in all other
cirripedes namely surrounding the thorax and natatory legs of the
pupa but in an abnormal position along the dorsal surface above the
sack and thorax of the pupa a transparent line where the new narrow
sack is in process of formation is the first indication of the coming
metamorphosis The sack in the capitulum of the male is not central
but lies near the dorsal surface the ventral interspace between the
outside and the sack is occupied by oblique fibres l fig 
which may be striless muscles but I suspect are ligamentous fibres
giving support to the whole projecting capitulum These fibres enter a
little way within the lobed peduncle they are probably homologous with
the strong muscles which run from beneath the upper end of the horny
disc of the female to the lower end of the orifice leading into the
sack Round the lobed peduncle there are two bands e f of
thin muscular fasci slightly oblique to each other and attached at
the ends to the outer membrane they are evidently homologous with the
external transverse muscles which are best developed round the same
part in the female Some of these muscles present a singular chainlike
appearance from being strangled at intervals they act probably in
aiding the long probosciformed penis to protrude itself out of the
sack I could not detect any longitudinal muscles and the lower part
of the peduncle seems destitute of muscles of any kind

     I believe I saw in one specimen most delicate transverse
    muscular fibres round the lower part of the elongated capitulum

The internal structure of the animal is very simple Within the lower
end of the peduncle there is a dark purple eye c under the
th of an inch in diameter a testis d and a b vesicula
seminalis These organs falsely appear as if suspended in the middle
of the peduncle but they are really attached I believe within a
separate partition to the ventral surface occupying the same position
as the mass of ovarian cca in the female The eye lies on the line of
junction between the testis and the vesicula seminalis and on their
ventral side The testis is rounded and consists of a mass of cells
on an average th of an inch in diameter The vesicula seminalis
varies extremely in condition being either a mere rather broad vessel
enlarged where it joins the testis or a bag fully as large as the
testis itself and distended with spermatozoa all arranged parallel to
its longer axis There was an evident relation between the size of the
vesicula seminalis and that of the testis the number of the cells in
the latter decreasing as the mass of the spermatozoa increased there
was also an evident relation between the age of the male and the state
of these organs younger and more opaque individuals having their
testes of large size and older specimens with the lower end of the
peduncle arrived at its full dimensions having the vesicula distended
Some few old specimens had evidently discharged their spermatozoa By
dissection I more than once distinctly traced the vesicula seminalis
entering the broad lower end of the penis The membrane forming
the vesicula is ringed and I presume is as in other cirripedes
contractile so as to expel the spermatozoa The probosciformed penis
m is of extraordinary length it is plainly ringed or rather
articulated in this respect resembling that organ in Ibla and Alepas
it tapers gradually and terminates as usual with a brush of fine
bristles it is furnished with delicate voluntary muscles arising from
the body round its basis and extending no doubt up to the apex but
too fine to be traced all the way Its broad lower end is attached in
a slight depression on the ventral side of the sack a little above
the point of attachment of the pupal antenn According to all analogy
the spot whence the penis springs must be considered as representing
the thorax and abdomen and the outer membrane of the penis is here as
on this view it should be reflexed and is continuous with that lining
the sack Ordinarily the penis lies coiled up in complicated folds
appearing like a large intestinal worm and fills the lobed part of
the peduncle which apparently serves for no other purpose than its
reception In one case in which I dissected out the penis I found
it in its contracted state th of an inch in length equal to
that of the entire capitulum and peduncle in a specimen in which the
penis had been naturally exserted the part which protruded m was
by itself rather longer than the whole animal and as this specimen
had been placed in spirits of wine the organ no doubt was contracted
hence I think it probable that the probosciformed penis when fully
stretched out would equal twice the length of the entire animal

There must be a nervous system and there must likewise be a gland
homologous with the ovaria for secreting the cement but I could not
distinguish parts so small Certainly there is no mouth or stomach or
thorax or limbs of any kind or abdomen

It is obvious that these males must be very shortlived they perform
their masculine functions and then perish We have seen however
that after the act of metamorphosis they do grow a little and I have
reason to suspect that this is effected as with other Cirripedes
by moulting The growth must be absolutely dependent on the store of
nutriment laid up within the pupa The young male immediately after
the exuviation of the integuments thorax natatory legs abdomen
and eyes of the pupa consists of a pulpy cellular mass without any
internal organs as yet formed

Judging from the different sizes of the females which included
perfectly developed ova I infer that they must breed more than once
during their lives and therefore that successive sets of males as
in the genus Scalpellum must become attached to them I was not
however able to discover the prehensile antenn or other remains of
the old males adherent to the females a circumstance which I presume
is accounted for by their attachment being weak Considering the
very small size of the male it is not surprising that so manyin
one case fourteenare required to impregnate the numerous ova of a
single female How the males know the proper period when the ova
lying in a sheet at the very base of the sack of the female are ready
for impregnation I cannot say without it be that they perceive
the moulting of the external membrane close to the edge of which
they are attached for this moulting would indicate the period when
the ovigerous lamella came to the surface of the sack and the ova
would then be soon ready for impregnation From the position in which
the males are attached and from the extraordinary length of the
probosciformed penis capable of voluntary movements I have no doubt
the males can insert the tip of this organ within the lower edge of
the orifice of the sack and there discharge the spermatozoa which
by their own movements must pass down the sides of the sack of the
female till they reach their proper destination The position of the
males with respect to the females body is almost exactly the same
as that occupied by the complemental males of Scalpellum Peronii
and villosum the lower and narrow end of the fissure worn in the
gasteropod shell here affording that protection to the males which
the edges of the opposed scuta afford to the complemental males
of the above two species of Scalpellum We cannot doubt that these
latter males aid in the impregnation of the ova of the hermaphrodites
but they are not furnished with a very long penis probably for the
very reason that they are complemental males and therefore not so
absolutely necessary for the impregnation of the ova as are the males
of Alcippe

I have in my former volume expressed my astonishment at the extent
to which abortion had been carried in the male Ibla but it has been
carried much further in the male Alcippe In Ibla the thorax is
reduced to a mere flap and only two pairs of cirri exist in a most
useless and rudimentary state but there is a well organised mouth
stomach and anus In the males of Scalpellum vulgare ornatum
and rutilum there is no mouth or stomach but there is a thorax with
four pairs of minute modified cirri and a large abdominal lobe Here
in the male Alcippe all these negatives are united we have no mouth
no stomach no thorax no cirri no abdomen The archetype crustacean
consists of twentyone segments of these the seventeen anterior
segments can be clearly made out in the archetype Cirripede now in
the male Alcippe the first three segments are largely developed
forming all that is externally visible but the remaining fourteen
segments are absolutely aborted but in idea may be considered as
forming the membranous depression whence the probosciformed penis
springs for this organ normally arises at the extremity of the
seventeenth segment To show the wonderful diversity of nature even
in the same subclass I may be permitted to remark that whilst in
Alcippe only the three anterior segments are developed the fourteen
succeeding segments being rudimentary in Proteolepas hereafter to be
described these fourteen segments are all largely developed whilst
the three anterior segments are quite aborted being represented only
by a thin envelope to the two threads by which this Cirripede is
attached to the supporting object

     It may be worth stating that in order to procure perfect
    specimens of the female and male Alcippe pieces of the shell
    inhabited by them should be dissolved in weak acids




ORDER IIABDOMINALIA

Cirripedia having a flaskshaped carapace body consisting of one
cephalic seven thoracic and three abdominal segments the latter
bearing three pairs of cirri the thoracic segments without limbs
mouth with the labrum greatly produced and capable of independent
movements sophagus armed with teeth at its lower end larva firstly
egglike without external limbs or an eye lastly binocular without
thoracic legs but with abdominal appendages


I feel compelled to form an Order for the one genus and species
namely Cryptophialus minutus to be here described We must I
conceive attribute much greater value in classification to internal
parts and organs at least where such are not known to vary than to
external structure Now in Cryptophialus the body consists of eight
segments of which the first two are not developed in any cirripede
hitherto described Of the eight the seven posterior or thoracic
segments are quite free or detached from the carapace and do not
bear any appendages whereas in all the foregoing cirripedes of the
order Thoracica there are at least in the normal sex six pairs of
cirri Alcippe alone must be excepted in which there are only two
pairs Again in the Thoracica there are no abdominal appendages
excepting the terminal or caudal whereas in Cryptophialus the abdomen
bears three pairs of biramous cirri In the crest of the labrum
being produced into a special lancetformed organ articulated at its
base and capable of movement and in the palpi projecting straight
upwards we have a great difference from all other cirripedes
and these organs we have every reason to believe possess a high
classificatory importance The sophagus in Cryptophialus where it
enters the stomach is armed with teeth and hairs moved by muscles
forming a beautiful structure of which we have not a trace in any
other cirripede Lastly and perhaps most importantly of all the
metamorphosis is different for the early larval stages are passed
under an egglike condition within the sack of the parent and the pupa
differs from the pup of all other cirripedes in not having natatory
thoracic limbs and is therefore only able to crawl about by the aid of
its great prehensile antenn

Thus far the evidence is decisive in favour of Cryptophialus being
placed in a separate Order but if we were to trust to the characters
derived from the external covering or carapaceand such characters
are of high importance as we may safely infer from the natural
arrangement of the foregoing families which depends on the structure
of the carapacewe should place Cryptophialus close to Alcippe
amongst the Lepadid These genera agree in their burrowing habitsin
their attachment by a horny rostral discin the external membrane
being covered with triturating pointsin the spinose and notched
orifice with an external lateral bar on each side and in the inner
tunic of the sack being protected by hairs and spines They agree to
a considerable extent in shape and in the peculiar arrangement of
the muscles of the whole external covering of the animal they agree
also in their manner of growth and in the sack extending down to
their basal extremity Some of these resemblances may possibly be
analogical and due to similarity of habits and not to affinity and
we must attribute to mere similarity in function a certain amount of
resemblance in their labrums for this part is essentially different
in the two genera and to the same cause the resemblance between the
brush formed by the two pairs of thoracic cirri and caudal appendages
at the end of part of the thorax in Alcippe with the three pairs of
abdominal cirri at the end of the whole thorax in Cryptophialus I
allude to this latter resemblance for it was owing to it and to the
similarity in the habits of Cryptophialus and Alcippe that I stated
in the introduction to my former volume on the Lepadid that the two
genera would probably fall into the same order In the structure of all
the parts of the mouth and of the cirri in the digestive organs and in
the metamorphoses Cryptophialus is not more closely related to Alcippe
than to any other genus whatever amongst the Lepadid

Nevertheless I am confirmed in the view that the external resemblances
between these two genera are due to some real affinity and are not
merely analogical by a very remarkable factnamely that Alcippe and
Cryptophialus are both bisexual and have males several in number
attached exactly in the same position and which males are so closely
similar that considered by themselves they might absolutely be almost
classed as species of the same genus For they agree in the absence of
all internal organs and parts excepting the single testis vesicula
seminalis and immensely long probosciformed penis and they agree
also in manner of growth in the arrangement of the muscles and even
in shape The whole case seems to me very singular and as far as my
knowledge extends unique we have two animals of which the females
if classed by their external parts homologically consisting of the
three anterior segments of the head would be placed alongside each
other in the same family but when classed by the whole rest of their
organisation certainly must be ranked in distinct orders yet
the males of these very same animals might almost stand in the same
genus If it be asked why the position of Cryptophialus in the system
should not be determined by the male instead of by the female the
answer would be that the male is here abnormal and rudimentary in
its whole structure and I believe systematists are agreed that less
perfect parts and therefore a less perfect whole offer less valuable
characters than the more perfect parts or whole We see this conclusion
plainly verified in the case of the hermaphrodite Scalpellum vulgare
and Ibla quadrivalvis for there can be no doubt where these species
should be arranged yet if we attempted to place them by their
complemental males we should utterly fail exactly in the same manner
if Ibla Cumingii and Scalpellum ornatum were ranked by their males
they would be quite misplaced So again if we were to attempt to class
the six species of Scalpellum by their males and complemental males
undoubtedly the first three and last three species of the genus would
have to stand in distinct orders Hence we may reject the males as a
foundation for classification but no doubt they serve to show that the
resemblances in the carapaces of Alcippe and Cryptophialus are not
merely analogical or functional but evince a true affinity though
these genera differ so greatly in mouth body sophagus cirri and
especially in their metamorphoses

     M Milne Edwards would perhaps in accordance with the
    profound views lately propounded by him on classification consider
    Cryptophialus as an extremely modified and to a certain extent
    degraded member or satellite of the type of the Lepadid but
    I do not myself feel able to draw a line of distinction between
    the being a very abnormal member of one group and belonging to
    a distinct group I may add that I have several times tried to
    persuade myself with no success into the belief that I have
    somehow misunderstood the homologies of the thoracic segments and
    cirri of Alcippe and Cryptophialus for if this were so the two
    genera could be brought into much closer relationship but with
    any conceivable amount of error on my part there remains the
    great difference in the metamorphosis not to mention the palpable
    differences in the cirri the parts of the mouth and in the whole
    course of the alimentary canal




CRYPTOPHIALUS MINUTUS Pl   fig  to 

  HabChonos Archipelago Southern Chile imbedded in the
  Concholepas Peruviana


FEMALE Fig 

General AppearanceThis the smallest known cirripede is
flaskshaped and compressed with a small orifice on a more or less
produced neck placed at one corner one of the narrow sides of this
carapace is somewhat flattened or depressed with its superior edge
prolonged a little upwards by this side the animal is attached to
the cavity in the shell within which it is lodged There is here no
distinction between a peduncle and capitulum that is between the
lower or anterior and the upper or posterior end of the animal
as seen externally The small orifice is toothed and hairy it is
coloured purple as is likewise the projecting labrum the rest of
the animal being tinted only by the muscles and internal parts seen
through the outer integuments The largest specimen fig  which I
have measured did not quite attain the length of one tenth of an inch
This cirripede inhabits in vast numbers the shells of the living
Concholepas Peruviana amongst the Chonos islands the whole outside
of the shell being sometimes completely drilled by its cavities
almost touching each other as happens in the case of Alcippe with the
shells of Buccinum The oval aperture leading into the shellcavity
in fullsized specimens is between  of an inch in length it
is generally surrounded by a narrow internal calcareous rim which
apparently has the same inorganic origin as in Alcippe The toothed
orifice of the carapace leading into the sack fills up the orifice of
the shellcavity but it can be voluntarily withdrawn a little when
opened and the animal is in action the lancetformed moveable crest
of the labrum and the abdominal cirri are exserted

     I am greatly indebted to Dr Hooker for having several years
    ago when I examined this my first cirripede aided me in many
    ways and shown me how to dissect the more difficult parts and for
    having made for me several very correct drawings which with some
    subsequent alterations are now engraved

IntegumentsThe external membrane is colourless thin but strong
it is studded with minute bifid trifid and quadrifid points of hard
chitine which are the agents of excavation they are directed upwards
except towards the lower end where they are directed from the disc
or surface of attachment These points beneath the orifice and on
each side close along the lateral bar are larger than elsewhere
There are no points on the disc or surface of attachment which is
formed of somewhat thickened yellowish membrane and is not moulted
like the rest of the external membrane but is formed of successive
layers extending beyond each other the lines of growth however
being obscure and only occasionally distinguishable The disc is
oval not extending to the lower end of the animal and with the upper
edge thinning out and produced upwards fig  The animal during
its growth moves a little downwards in its cavity by means of the
new layers of the attached disc being formed not symmetrically with
respect to the old layers but beyond them or at a greater depth in
the shell hence when the animal is removed quite perfect by the
Concholepas being dissolved in acid the upper and deserted margin
of the disc or surface of attachment generally projects as a free
edge but in a tattered and worn condition In full grown specimens
which have ceased burrowing downwards nearly the whole disc though
occupying the same position relatively to the animal becomes in fact
deserted and is lined by membrane continuous with and like that
investing the rest of the body but furnished only with simple blunt
points instead of with the sharp bifid and trifid triturating points

The orifice is formed on each side by a toothed rim of hard chitine
fig   which can be opened and shut owing to its being flexible
at the rostral end and folded inwards at the carinal or posterior
end The teeth vary in arrangement and sharpness generally they form
taking a rim on one side fig  two prominences or groups of points
at the rostral or anterior end always separated by a broad notch
from the bottom of which the lateral bar extends downwards from the
posterior larger and less regularly toothed half of the rim Of these
teeth the larger ones project nearly straight up and the smaller and
lower teeth outwards graduating into the smaller teeth just below
the rim which again graduate into the minute points studded over the
whole surface These outer teeth probably serve to prevent any creature
crawling into the cavity between the shell and animal Scattered
bristles rise from all over the rim The lateral bar above alluded
to consists of the general membrane of the body thickened hardened
rendered elastic coloured yellow and apparently formed into a fold
where attached to the under side of the rim at the abovementioned
notch the bar is thinner and more flexible than elsewhere it runs
half way down the animal first straight and then curved towards
and closely approaching the disc or surface of attachment At the
lower end the bar or more strictly the thickened membranous margin
of the bar b fig  expands into an oblong slightly rigid
plate studded with from three or four to ten or twelve points which
have their ends expanded and truncated or even slightly bifid The
extremity of this plate projects freely from the general surface of the
body We shall afterwards refer to the use of this extremely peculiar
bar and plate

The two rims forming the orifice cannot be quite closed but ingress
by any foreign object into the sack is beautifully prevented by an
internal membranous lip on each side d fig   and by a
third inwardly folded lip d at the posterior and broad end of
the orifice These three lips can be brought together and form a
valve The lateral lips are very narrow at the mouth or rostral end
of the orifice where the hairy lancetshaped crest of the labrum
closes the orifice and largely expand towards the posterior end they
are produced from the inner tunic of the sack they appear formed of
the finest hairs placed parallel and approximate but when examined
under the highest powers these hairs for they still appear such are
found to be united by delicate membrane which has its extreme edge
fimbriated The third or posterior and inwardly folded lip differs
in being composed of much coarser flattened hairs which are united
towards their bases and are free at their extremities where they are
serrated or coarsely plumose on both sides

The sack extends down to the lower end of the animal It is lined by
delicate membrane At the orifice on each side a little posteriorly
to the lateral external bars this inner membrane is strengthened by a
pair of thin yellowish bars c fig  which run parallel to the
straight portions of the external bars These inner bars at their lower
ends become pointed and die out at their upper ends and close to the
rim they are broader but more flexible and so transparent as hardly
to be distinguished from the rest of the membrane At the rostral end
of the orifice in a medial line this same inner tunic of the sack
is thickened for a short space downwards so as to form a fifth bar
c which separating from the inner tunic runs inwards between
the outer and inner membranes of the carapace i e between b and
c fig   behind the mouth as far down as opposite to the lower
end of the sophagus and there becoming thinner and ligamentous
gives attachment to some powerful muscles

At each exuviation the external membrane with the dentated hardened
orifice the lateral bars the inner tunic of the sack with its bars
are all moulted together with the usual integuments of the animals
body New and sharp triturating points are thus periodically formed for
the work of excavation The whole animal increases during growth in
every direction and therefore at its lower or basal end as was the
case with Alcippe The disc or surface of attachment is added to by
new underlying layers extending beyond the old layers at the lower end
and on the sides but not at the upper end where as in the case of
the calcareous discs of Lithotrya the old layers are deserted and worn
away I saw what I believed to be little globules or patches of cement
but I was not able to discover any cementducts

Muscles of Sack and OrificeThe animal is surrounded by rather
strong longitudinal muscles not running up close to the orifice these
muscles exhibited to my surprise distinct traces of transverse stri
there are no external transverse muscles as in all the Lepadid
Attached to both sides of the inward fold or hinge at the posterior
end of the orifice some striated or voluntary muscles run for a short
distance downwards diverging like a fan their contraction would cause
the dentated rim to open a strictly homologous muscle occurs only in
Alcippe At the opposite end of the orifice a remarkably powerful
voluntary muscle is attached to the ligamentous bar above described as
proceeding from the rostromedial end of the toothed rim c and
at its lower expanded end it is attached under rather above the middle
of the disc this muscle corresponds with a similar one in Alcippe
and with some much weaker muscles in other Lepadid Its action would
be to draw down within the shellcavity the whole dentated rim and
likewise to close the orifice and here I believe come into use
the lateral elastic horny bars with their curious basal projecting
plates furnished with expanded points for much friction would thus
be caused by yet some play be allowed for the several movements
the elasticity of the bar bringing up the dentated orifice when the
powerful muscles attached to the rostral end of the latter became
relaxed Round the space where the justmentioned muscles are attached
to the horny disc a sheet of other muscles radiate a few on both
sides obliquely upwards but the greater number transversely and within
the firstdescribed longitudinal muscles they extend on both sides
about half round the animal There are similar muscles in Alcippe but
not extending so far round the animal Their action must be to draw the
whole carapace towards the surface of attachment the action of the
longitudinal muscles being to shorten it the orifice supported by the
lateral horny bars serving as the fulcrum for the contraction of the
longitudinal muscles I could not see any adductor scutorum muscle
although I looked particularly under the expanded plates at the ends of
the lateral external horny bars

BodyThis is laterally compressed it is widest and thickest at the
upper end and thence tapers to the lower or posterior end The last
three or four thoracic segments are bent under the anterior segments
giving the whole something of the appearance of certain crustaceans
divested of their legs The somewhat conical mouth with its singular
labrum is very large The body consists of eight segments The first
segment fig   or that succeeding the mouth is the seventh or
last cephalic segment of the archetype crustacean it is the largest of
all eight segments it is joined by its dorsal surface to the carapace
or external covering of the animal and the membrane with which it is
invested is prolonged upwards and downwards c c fig  and so
forms the inner tunic of the sack The succeeding seven segments are
thoracic they are free and are destitute of limbs the articulations
separating them are transverse The first and second thoracic segments
give rise on their medial dorsal surfaces each to a remarkable
tapering curved appendage presently to be described At the end of the
last thoracic segment there is a minute abdomen bearing three pairs
of biramous cirri

The Mouth consists of three pairs of organs namely the outer
maxill maxill mandibles with their palpi and of a great and very
curious labrum These organs by the fusion as in other cirripedes
of their lower segments form a large somewhat conical projecting
mouth which is separated on the ventral surface from the rest of the
body by a distinct fold or articulation where the muscles proceeding
to the above gnathites are attached The labrum e fig   is of
large size and the crest close over the opening of the sophagus is
produced into a great lancetshaped moveable organ wholly unlike
anything occurring in any other cirripede it is coloured purple and
is thickly fringed in the upper part by very fine hairs it is bowed a
little backwards from the mouth the base which rather overhangs the
sophagus is a little contracted and is transversely marked by an
articulation two small parallel voluntary muscles with transverse
stri are attached at their lower ends close beneath the articulation
and extend about one third up the organ their contraction would serve
to erect it and their relaxation would apparently allow it to fall
backwards on a little knob e fig  behind This little knob
resembles a similar projection in many of the Lepadid As the labrum
is formed of similar membrane with that of the succeeding segment of
the body its limit downward beneath the knob can be told only by a
small apodeme which projects inwards at a little distance within the
line where the membrane of the body is reflexed upwards c so as to
form the inner tunic of the sack

The mandibles palpi and maxill all project more than is usual The
Palpi f fig   are narrow flattened and taper a little
they support a few long bristles on their tips and on one of their
sides In every other cirripede in which the palpi are developed they
are directed transversely across the mouth one towards the other and
are for a considerable space united to the labrum here they project
straight up and seem to rise exteriorly to the bases of the mandibles
they are however united to the basal lateral edges of the labrum and
when the latter is torn from the rest of the mouth the palpi separate
with it I could not distinguish the knob on which in every other
cirripede the palpi are articulated The Mandibles fig  have an
upper lower and middle tooth with some finer intermediate points
and hairs The Maxill fig  are narrowed in at their spinose
edge where there are three large spines and several finer bristles
together forming a flattened brush this organ is remarkable from the
apodeme a being bent into the shape of a scythe with the terminal
or bladeportion a little expanded and directed backwards and inwards
The Outer maxill are subtriangular in outline with several
bristles on their summits and along their outer surfaces

Segments of BodyI have stated that the mouth is succeeded by
eight segments As in all the cirripedes hitherto described the
body consists of only six segments the number eight at first seems
very improbable and therefore I may be permitted to state that both
Dr Hooker and myself when first examining this animal and having
no notion whatever regarding its homologies or the structure of
other cirripedes came to the conclusion judging only from external
appearances that is from the transverse folds and from the lines of
movement when the body was bent by a needle that there were really
eight segments I have since carefully looked to this point when the
outer membrane is cleaned and examined the four posterior segments are
very plain owing to a dorsal medial line being alternately either
thickened and coloured yellowish or thin and colourless the four
anterior segments are less plain but yet the membrane on the dorsal
surface on the line of each fold or articulation does present some
difference from being destitute of the fine transverse toothed
scales which occur on other parts But I lay most stress on the fact
that all these eight articulations were used for the attachment of
muscles Hence I conclude that the eight segments are real and we
shall see in the next order that the very same eight segments are as
plain in Proteolepas as in the larva of an insect or as in an annelid
There is good reason to believe that the general covering or carapace
consists in all cirripedes of the three anterior segments and that the
mouth judging from its appendages also consists of three segments
consequently the first segment of the body in Cryptophialus must be the
seventh or last cephalic segment and the seven next free segments must
be the normal seven thoracic segments

The first segment of the body i e last cephalic fig   is
as stated the largest and is attached dorsally to the carapace
its ventral surface is flattened and is formed of somewhat thickened
membrane on each side a little below the articulation separating this
segment from the mouth there is a small blunt projection with the
free part only th of an inch in length Each of these appendages
bears four or five bristles on one side near the summit and a few
on the other side lower down from their position I believe them
to be rudiments of a first pair of maxillipeds tetartognathites of
Milne Edwards of which no trace occurs in any other cirripede The
differences between this segment and the seven succeeding segments
is of interest as offering some confirmation of the belief lately
disputed by some naturalists that the cephalic and thoracic segments
in the class Crustacea do differ in their naturea conclusion which
we shall see further confirmed under Proteolepas The second and third
i e first and second thoracic segments   fig  are the
next largest and are remarkable from supporting singular appendages
already alluded to The sides of the second segment are formed of
thickened yellowish membrane The fifth and sixth segments are the
smallest and mark the point of chief flexure of the body The eighth
segment is a little elongated formed of thicker membrane than the
other segments and dorsally is indented by the anus

The singular tapering appendages fig  i k arising dorsally
from the second and third segments differ from each other only by the
upper one being smaller less curled and perhaps rather smoother When
first examining this animal not knowing that it was female and not
finding a probosciformed penis I concluded that these organs were of
this naturean excusable mistake considering their almost ringed
structure their somewhat constricted bases the direction of their
curvature and their position in the midst of the ova within the sack
On careful examination however these appendages are seen not to be
truly ringed or articulated but are covered with transverse lines of
scales hirsute on their edges these scales being less distinct or
even quite absent on the smooth upper portion they do not include
any muscles they are imperforate at the apex which is not furnished
with bristles as seems always to be the case with the probosciformed
penis and lastly they are lined by corium but are not occupied
by any vessel gland or organ of any kind The only function which
I can assign to these appendages is that of aiding the retention
of the ova within the sack for the ova when first produced are
aggregated round them at this period I several times observed long
somewhat curled very thin fibres not tapering like hairs adhering
to both appendages the nature of which fibres I cannot explain In
very many cirripedes there seems a strong tendency to the production of
tapering filamentary appendages somewhat like the two i k here
describednamely at the bottom of the sack in some Balanin at the
bases of the anterior cirri in Lepas and in some other genera and on
the dorsal surface of the prosoma in certain species of Pollicipes in
this latter case some of these appendages were covered by scales and
the prosoma whence they arose answers to the third segment of the body
in Cryptophialus or that supporting the lower and larger appendage
Appendages of this nature in several cirripedes serve for the
lodgment of the testes but in some cases they are of no apparent use
excepting perhaps in aiding respiration by the expansion of corium
thus exposed and this partially may be their function here for there
are no proper branchi

CirriThere are three pairs together forming a nearly straight
brush of considerable length projecting in a line with the last
thoracic segment Each cirrus is biramous In a moderately large
specimen there were twenty segments in one of the longest rami Each
segment fig  a is strengthened by a dorsal or posterior shield
of thickened yellowish membrane from the upper edge of which a single
smooth spine projects the anterior surface is likewise strengthened
on the two edges by thickened membrane and supports two pairs of long
spines which are plumose or rather hirsute on both sides In the
lower segments of both rami of the several cirri the inner spine of
each pair is considerably shorter than the outer spineevidently in
relation to the little power of divergence of the two rami All the
cirri resemble each other excepting that the rami of the anterior
pair are rather shorter than those of the other cirri but the dorsal
spines on their segments are longer In all ordinary cirripedes the two
rami are equally supported by the upper segment of the pedicel which
latter is very short compared with the lower segment and is separated
from it by a transverse articulation Here fig  the exterior or
anterior ramus is articulated on the pedicel almost like a branch in
front of the other ramus which seems more directly continuous with
the pedicel The upper segment of the latter is separated from the
lower segment both being of about the same size by a very oblique
articulation On the front surfaces of the pedicels there are two or
three pairs of spines

AbdomenThe three cirri on one side are separated from their
opposite pairs by a prominent longitudinal fold formed of thickened
yellowish membrane which when foreshortened by being viewed dorsally
looks like a style projecting immediately beneath the anus The
transverse folds separating the three pairs are exceedingly slight
The inner basal edges of the pedicels of the cirri project slightly
inwards as apodemes giving I believe attachment to some muscles The
anus lies between the posterior pair of cirri and deeply indents the
last thoracic segment The transverse folds separating the three pairs
of cirri little developed as they are must according to all analogy
be considered as representing three segments of the body and as we
have accounted for seven cephalic and seven thoracic segments we must
conclude that these are three abdominal segments We know moreover
that the abdomen in the pup of the Thoracica with a single exception
does actually consist of three segments

Movements of the Mouth Thorax and Cirri cJudging from the
fact of the lancetshaped appendage of the labrum being more or less
exserted in dead specimens out of the shellcavity and from the
analogy of other cirripedes I do not doubt that the whole mouth can be
considerably raised and depressed we have seen also that the rostral
end of the toothed orifice of the sack can be pulled down which would
aid in exposing the mouth and labrum The wellarticulated thorax
by the aid of the muscles attached to every segment can certainly
be doubled up and contracted so that the cirri with their pedicels
coloured purple like the exposed labrum can be wholly protruded out
of the sack and shellcavity The three cirri no doubt can be separated
a little from each other both transversely and longitudinally and
according to analogy the two rami of each cirrus can likewise be
separated there are also muscles for moving the two segments of the
pedicel of each cirrus and other muscles run up the many segments of
the rami We have seen that the great lancetformed appendage of the
labrum laterally fringed with fine hairs can be erected and I do
not doubt that the prey when entangled by the expanded cirri is borne
against this appendage and is then by the retraction of the thorax
dragged down its smooth surface to the mouth where it is seized by
the mandibles and maxill which lie like a trap at the bottom of an
inclined and moveable plane

Alimentary CanalThe sophagus is long it runs backwards from
the mouth and then downwards at its lower end where it enters
the stomach the part which in other cirripedes is expanded and
bellshaped is modified in a most singular and quite peculiar manner
for the lower part of the sophagus after widening a little becomes
converted into what appears at first like a square box ths
of an inch across This box is really deeply folded see diagram
Pl  fig  into six longitudinal ridges and hollows two of
these hollows facing each other are wider than the others and when
the organ is dissected out of the body it generally lies fig 
with one of these faces exactly over the other the narrower lateral
folds being thus hidden and the whole consequently appearing like
a simple square box with concave sides But when a section is made
or the lower open end is turned upwards we see that the organ is
sixrayed and elongated with the longer axis standing parallel to
the flattened sides of the animals body The edges of the folds are
formed of yellowish thickened membrane with a sinuous or beaded
outline which serve to strengthen the organ Internally the two
broad concave sides are armed in their upper inwardly prominent fig
 part each with a disc ths of an inch in diameter crowded
with short thick brownish inwardly projecting teeth The two discs
stand exactly opposed to each other The bases of the teeth seen from
the outside Pl  fig  seem like brown little circles with
a smaller circle within The disc obscurely appears to be formed by
the confluence of two smaller discs which lie I believe at a very
small angle to each other beneath each of these half discs there is
a longitudinal band of very fine hairs the two bands uniting into
one lower down within the organ The internal longitudinal edges
also of the four lateral smaller folds are likewise clothed with fine
hairs hence we have six parallel longitudinal rows of very fine but
stiff hairs or eight if the united bands on the two broader faces
under the discs be counted each as two These bands of hairs and the
opposed discs armed with very strong teeth can be separated and
brought together with force by the action of strong constrictor and
diverging muscles Hence any prey carried down the sophagus before
entering the stomach would have to pass as it were through a mill
and be subjected to a severe trituration by the discs of teeth and
immediately beneath to a brushing by the six longitudinal bands of
hairs This curious and unique structure answers I believe the same
purpose as the four convex hardish crenated buttons on the posterior
thoracic cirri in Alcippe which are likewise unique in that genus I
observed that in some specimens the teeth had been worn quite blunt
but the teeth and hairs are periodically moulted and renewed together
with the whole sophagus

The stomach is broadest at the upper end and extends from a little
beneath the mouth down to the fifth segment of the body where it
becomes narrow It presented an irregularly contracted appearance and
was covered by a pulpy hepatic layer The rectum is of rather large
diameter it extends from the middle of the fifth segment to the end
of the eighth segment of the body or seventh of the thorax where
the large anus is situated lying between the posterior abdominal
cirri and partly hollowed out in this seventh segment The rectum
as in all other cirripedes is periodically moulted The food is of
a bright green colour as if of a confervoid nature the triturating
and brushing action of the sophagus seems to roll this matter into
pellets which apparently retain this form until finally expelled as
excrement certainly the excrement is in pellets and I have several
times seen pellets within the stomach

Organs of GenerationThe specimens as yet described are exclusively
female there being certainly no testes or vesicul seminales As in
every specimen collected early in January there were within the sack
either nearly mature eggs or young larv it was the worst period for
seeing the ovarian cca and I have failed to discover them in the
specimens now long kept in spirits of wine but I cannot doubt they
would be found between the inner and outer tunics of the carapace or
general covering near the disc I have stated in my original notes
made when the specimens were alive that the ova are at first perfectly
detached but some appearances make me believe that I overlooked as
might easily happen the often excessively fine membrane which in
other cirripedes unites the ova together and so forms the ovigerous
lamell The ova are much less numerous than in other genera varying
from only nineteen to about sixty In the same individual all the eggs
were always in the same state of development

MetamorphosesThe true ova in their earliest condition when in
the sack are ovate Pl  fig  orangecoloured quite smooth
and barely th of an inch in their longer axes They soon become
broader at one end than at the other and by degrees the narrow
posterior pointed end becomes developed into a slightly clubshaped
almost transparent fig  horn and the broader anterior end into
two rather longer horns The length of the oval part not measuring the
horns is nearly the same as in the primary true egg condition There
is as yet no trace of internal organs the whole contents consisting
of pulpy granular matter How far the above changes are effected by
moulting either of the whole or of part of the integuments of the
egglike body I cannot say but the pulpy matter within the ovum even
in its earliest stage was included within an inner envelope or case

In the next distinct stage there being however slighter intermediate
changes the posterior horn has shrunk and become converted into a
bluntlypointed conical termination for the whole body fig 
whereas the two anterior horns have approached each other on the
future ventral surface and have increased considerably in length and
thickness and contain within them the prehensile antenn which can be
externally seen and which I dissected out of these hornlike cases
The oval part of the egglike larva for I hardly know what to call it
is now very slightly shrunk being hardly more than ths of an
inch in length At this stage these bodies adhere by the tips of their
anterior horns containing the antenn in process of formation to the
inner tunic of the sack and likewise in little groups one to another
as the included prehensile antenn ultimately become attached by cement
proceeding no doubt as usual from a modified portion of the ovarian
tubes it seems probable that some cement may at this early period be
excreted but I could not make out the exact means of attachment The
egglike larv are also aggregated round the tapering curled dorsal
appendages of the second and third segments of the body and it is
possible that at this or at an earlier period these appendages may
act like the ovigerous frna in the Lepadid and serve to retain the
egglike larv within the sack

We come now to the last larval or pupal condition before the final
metamorphosis into the mature animal the changes above described have
been at least to a great degree if not absolutely gradual but the
pupa suddenly appears perfectly developed from the moulting of the
lastdescribed horned egglike larva It is now a free animal crawling
about the sack of its female parent It has increased a little in
length as compared with the oval part of the egglike larva in its
second stage namely from a little above ths to ths of an
inch from the position of the prehensile antenn in the two states
I have no doubt that this increase of size is entirely due to the
anterior part of the pupa being doubled up whilst within the egglike
larval envelope The pupa in shape fig  somewhat resembles a
coffin and is far less laterally compressed than other pup and
hence can easily be placed either on its dorsal or ventral surface
The prehensile antenn are of large size when the animal was alive
they were concealed under and partially included within the front
part of the carapace or shell which in this condition was not so much
truncated as in the drawing given fig  of a specimen lying on its
back with its antenn protruded Some specimens formerly examined for
me by Dr Hooker had their antenn and whole ventral surface forced
outwards apparently from the endosmose of the spirits of wine The
whole dorsal surface and the overlapping sides of the carapace are
elegantly punctured and are formed of a rather brittle substance here
and there supporting especially at the front end some fine and rather
long bristleswhich latter I have not seen on the pup of other
cirripedes The ventral surface is very narrow towards the posterior
end of the animal it is formed of thin structureless membrane On
this surface close to the posterior end there is a minute orifice
through which three pairs of bristles are protruded attached to as
I believe the rudimentary abdomen the bristles apparently cannot be
withdrawn

The antenn fig  as stated are of large size compared to the
whole animal they resemble in all essential respects the same organ
in other cirripedes The ultimate segment is unusually thick it
is terminated by five bristles one of which is longer than the others
and stands rather separated from them The discsegment is large
nearly circular with the broad edges transparent and membranous
on its posterior edge there is a single small spine The second or
main segment counting from the base has a single spine on its upper
margin close beneath the spine on the disc it is articulated to
the discsegment a little way from the disc itselfwhich is a
peculiarity I have not elsewhere noticed The basal segment is thick
and not so short as usual These organs are furnished with powerful
muscles They are generally protruded alternately and by the adhesion
of the suckerlike disc the animal drags itself along The suckerdisc
has great play and when observing specimens alive I compared its
action to that of a wristjoint The antenn when retracted within
the carapace lie parallel to each other

     As I have given in my former volume on the Lepadid p
     so many measurements of the antenn I may here add those of
    Cryptophialusthe length from the end of the disc to the end
    of the second segment formerly called by me erroneously the
    basal is ths of an inch the greatest width of the second
    segment ths the length of the little ultimate segment
    ths and its width under ths of an inch

Posteriorly to the antenna I distinctly saw the apodemes to which the
eyes are attached I was not able to distinguish any middle fork to the
apodeme which consequently does not resemble a UU but U The eyes are
dark purple and as usual compound in one specimen I counted twelve
ocelli within the common spherical envelope

I could not distinguish any thorax and certainly there is no mouth
nor from analogy could the latter be expected excepting as forming
part of the young cirripede there are no natatory legs which the
pup in all other cirripedes possess Of the three posteroventral
pairs of bristles the most posterior or dorsal pair differs from the
other two pairs in being considerably smaller and in being mounted
on elongated pedicels the two anterior pairs of bristles are strong
the three pairs are articulated one behind the other on a small
body apparently enclosed in a minute sack and certainly attached all
round by membrane to the internal edges of the orifice through which
the bristles are protruded These bristles when the pupa was alive
were often moved and served apparently to steady the body during the
alternate protraction and retraction of the prehensile antenn From
the fact of the pupa of other cirripedes having an abdomen formed of
three segments placed exactly in the same position as the minute body
here supporting the three pairs of spines I believe this body to be
the abdomen In other cirripedes only the posterior segment of the
abdomen bears spines which are supported on little limbs or pedicels
namely the caudal appendages the other segments being naked But as
the mature Cryptophialus unlike other cirripedes has abdominal cirri
the presence of spines on the corresponding abdominal segments in the
pupa is explained and rendered probable there can I think be little
doubt that the small terminal pair of spines supported on elongated
pedicels or limbs answers to the caudal appendages found in many
cirripedes

The whole course of the metamorphosis is very peculiar The gradual
changes in the egglike larv for I suppose they must be called larv
from a simple oval egg to pointed oval to oval with three horns and
lastly to oval with the two anterior horns larger and the posterior
horn reduced to a mere point seems to me very curious and offers as
far as I know a unique case It is interesting to reflect how perfect
a series in the development of an animal we have in different
members of the Articulatafrom an ordinary egg in which all the
changes go on unperceived and whence a perfect animal is maturedto
an egglike larva which undergoes the changes just described and which
turns into a pupa that does not eat or increase in sizeto a larva
which eats and increases in size but undergoes only one great change
as in most insectsto a larva undergoing several great changes as in
the case of ordinary cirripedes before its final metamorphosis into
the mature animal The first larval condition of other cirripedes in
which there is a single eye three pairs of thoracic limbs and a much
elongated pointed body covered by a prolongation of the carapace
is here not fully developed or matured but this stage is I think
clearly and very curiously indicated by the posterior horn of the
egglike larva which we may suppose represents the posterior pointed
end of the body for it disappears in the succeeding stage just as it
does in the second larval condition of other cirripedes In the first
stage of ordinary cirripedial larv the anterior horns are always
present serving as in the case of these egglike bodies to enclose
and protect the antenn during their formation The second egglike
stage answers to the second larval condition of ordinary cirripedes
as described and figured Pl  fig  in the introduction to the
Balanid The third or pupal state is fully developed in all cases

Finally the pupa of Cryptophialus is peculiar in its punctured hairy
surface and in its shape which in being so much more depressed than
usual retains an earlier larval condition but its chief and highly
remarkable character consists in the entire absence of natatory legs
and in consequence instead of there being a large sack within the
carapace with an elongated orifice on the ventral surface there is
only a quite minute orifice at the extreme posterior end of the animal
through which the bristles borne apparently on all three segments of
the minute abdomen are protruded

The pup of the male and female are exactly alike in all their general
characters and probably in every point of detail but my later and
more minute observations were made only on pup which from their
place of attachment would certainly have turned into males As these
pup without any further metamorphosis were developed into males we
may I think safely infer that such is the case with the females and
consequently that the whole course of the metamorphosis has been in
this cirripede seen and described During this whole course no food
could possibly have been obtained for the pupa is destitute of a mouth
or organs of prehension and the stock of cellular matter enclosed
within the ovum has been sufficient for all the above changes and for
the final metamorphosis We shall moreover immediately see in the
case of the male that the stock of cellular matter has also sufficed
for the development of testes spermatozoa and a wonderfully elongated
probosciformed penis


MALE Pl  fig 

By throwing pieces of the perforated shell of a Concholepas into
acid I examined several scores of specimens of the Cryptophialus
and on all with the exception of a few young individuals males were
attached They were attached by cement proceeding in the usual manner
from the prehensile antenn outside to the edges of the upper half
of the disc formed of the thicker notmoulted membrane by which the
female adheres in her chamber hence the males are included in the
upper part of the same cavity with the female into which they must
have crawled as pup I found from one or two up in one case to seven
males attached to the same female four or five being the most usual
number In the early part of January when all my specimens were taken
many of the males had not shed their pupal integuments and of those
that had the majority were immature a few only having spermatozoa
all the females had within their sacks either ova including almost
perfect pup or fully developed pup we may consequently conclude
that these young males were maturing in order to impregnate the next
set of eggs

The male immediately after its metamorphosis from its pupal condition
which has been fully described is almost globular but slightly
bilobed and is formed of strong structureless transparent membrane
including a mass of cellular matter apparently without any included
organs it is attached by about the middle between the anterior and
posterior lobes by the notmoulted prehensile antenn When the male
is mature its greatest length measured from the posterior end where
the orifice is seated to the anterior and blunter end is about
 of an inch and therefore rather less than the pupa which
was ths in length Relatively to a full grown female the male
slightly exceeds half the diameter of the toothed orifice leading into
her sack see z fig  Pl  In the mature condition fig 
one lobe namely the upper or posterior has become more pointed and
is terminated by a minute orifice ths of an inch in diameter
This orifice is formed by a rim of thickened brownish membrane which
on what was the ventral surface has a few very minute but strong
sometimes bifid spinesin this one character the male resembling
the female The other and lower homologically anterior end or lobe
is broader and contains a mass of cellular matter which from its
close resemblance in appearance and position to similar matter within
the male Alcippe I have no doubt forms the contents of the testis
In one single specimen I succeeded in isolating a vesicula seminalis
of small size containing perfectly distinct spermatozoa Across the
middle between the two lobes close under the outer integument
there is a broad layer of rather strong transverse muscular fasci
I did not observe any eye the presence of which I should have
expected from analogy Internally there is no mouth thorax cirri
or other organs excepting the testis and vesicula seminalis just
mentioned and an immensely elongated probosciformed penis coiled up
and filling the rest of the inside of the sack down to the testis
which latter occupies the whole anterior and generally lower end
of the animal This penis is plainly articulated and includes fine
transverselystriated muscles no doubt it can be protruded through
the minute orifice and voluntarily moved about Out of a male
ths of an inch in length I dissected a penis which when not
stretched measured ths of an inch in length when a portion
was pulled between two needles it could be stretched to apparently
three times its former length and I should think that this organ
could be extended by the animal to perhaps even the ths of
an inchthat is to between eight and nine times its own entire
length The use of this enormously elongated penis obviously is
that the spermatozoa of these males which are so extremely small in
size compared to the female should all be conveyed within the sack
and none be lost It should be borne in mind that the whole male
including every part is scarcely larger than a single ovum of which
sometimes sixty have to be impregnated by only two or three males In
a fullgrown female the distance from one of the attached males to
the middle of the orifice leading into the sack is about the ths
of an inch equal to the length of the coiled up notextended penis
the further distance from the orifice of the sack to an ovum lying at
the bottom of the sack would be almost ths of an inch so that
the spermatozoa have to pass a distance of ths of an inch from
the testis of the male to the lower ova I believe two thirds of this
distance would be passed safely along the probosciformed penis

The resemblance between the male of Cryptophialus and of Alcippe is
truly surprising and is the more wonderful considering the great
dissimilarity of their pup Hardly any characters can be pointed
out in which these males differ excepting such as might have been
thought of only specific value namely the relative proportions of the
different parts and mere external shape The peduncle growing a little
after the metamorphosis in the male of Alcippe and the prolongation
of its capitulum with the included oblique ligamentous fibres are the
greatest differences Having fully remarked under Alcippe on the
wonderfully rudimentary condition of these males destitute as they are
of so many parts and organs I will here say nothing further on these
singular creatures destined to discharge their spermatozoa die and
be succeeded by a fresh set of shortlived male successors




Order IIIAPODA

Cirripedia with the carapace reduced to two separate threads serving
for attachment body consisting of one cephalic seven thoracic and
three abdominal segments all destitute of cirri Mouth suctorial with
the mandibles and maxill placed back to back enclosed in a hood
formed by the union of the labrum and palpi Metamorphoses unknown


The characters above given fully justify I think the formation of
this order though it contains only one species the Proteolepas
bivincta The mere external appearance Pl  fig  so
wonderfully different from that of every other cirripede would by
itself prompt to this same conclusion At first sight the Proteolepas
if of freshwater origin might even have been mistaken for the larva
of some insect fastened by two threads to its prey The entire
absence of the three anterior segments of the head and therefore of
the carapace or speaking strictly the mere rudiment of these parts
forming an envelope to the two cementductsthe absence of a stomach
rectum and anusthe entire absence of thoracic and abdominal
appendages or cirrithe absence of a probosciformed penisare all
negative characters which might ensue from degradation so common
with parasites and which might therefore have been esteemed of not
high classificatory value But the suctorial mouth with the palpi and
labrum united into a hood and with the mandibles and maxill reversed
or turned back to back so as to be utterly incapable of prehension
is a type of structure not hitherto met with I believe in any other
animal and cannot be explained away by degradation The formation of
the ova within the segments of the body a peculiarity confined to
this one cirripede evidently results from the nondevelopment of the
anterior part of the head within which the ova are usually formed
but the compound structure of the vesicula seminalis is a peculiarity
which cannot be thus explained Proteolepas has no particular affinity
to any other cirripede it resembles indeed Cryptophialus in one
important point but only in one point namely in the number of the
segments of its body It is really beautiful to see how the homologies
of the archetype cirripede as deduced from the metamorphoses of
other cirripedes are plainly illustrated during the maturity of this
degraded creature and are demonstrated to be identical with those of
the archetype Crustacean I was at first inclined to rank Proteolepas
in one division and all other cirripedes in another division of
equal value but as it may be inferred from the characters of the
prehensile antenn that the pupa did not differ much if at all in any
important character from the pup of other cirripedes I have thought
the three orders which I have instituted would be the most natural
arrangement As any one looking at the drawing given of Proteolepas
might very naturally feel inclined to protest against its being ranked
as a cirripede I must reurge the importance of the pupal antenn
being constituted on the common type for from their structure by the
law of correlation that of the whole pupa may be inferred and even
still more I must insist on the importance of the one great character
of the antenn being cemented to the surface of attachment by matter
proceeding as we shall see in a modified state from the great
ovarian sack The structure also of the mouth to a certain extent
the segmentation of the body though in appearance so peculiar the
hermaphrodite condition the single penis the absence of oviducts all
accord with and taken together demonstrate its cirripedial nature




PROTEOLEPAS BIVINCTA Pl   figs 

  HabParasitic within the sack of the Alepas cornuta from St
  Vincents West Indies Brit Mus


General AppearanceThe entire animal as already remarked
curiously resembles at the first glance the larva of some insect
It is rounded but somewhat compressed and tapers gently towards the
posterior end It lies curved in an arc the ventral surface being
concave and the dorsal convex but a little flattened dorsally at the
anterior and blunter end Its length if straightened would rather
exceed one fifth of an inch The body consists of eleven segments
which excepting the three terminal are conspicuously plain The
first segment is surmounted by a rather small mouth which any one
would assuredly at first consider as the entire head though he
would in vain search here for eyes antenn or other parts of the
three anterior cephalic segments On the dorsal surface low down on
the second segment of the body two quite flexible thin but strong
flattened threads arise which terminate in a pair of prehensile
antenn having the usual cirripedial structure From the penultimate
or disc segment of these antenn cement has been excreted by which
the antenn are firmly cemented low down to the rostral end of the sack
of the cirripede the Alepas cornuta on which it is parasitic hence
Proteolepas lies with its back downwards and with its ventral concave
surface fitting the convex body of the Alepas its mouth lies under
the middle of the soft prosoma of the latter cirripede which I cannot
doubt that it lacerates and sucks

     I may be permitted to premise that though I procured only a
    single specimen yet perceiving its very singular nature I took
    such care and length of time in the dissection and repeated every
    observation so many times that I think reliance may be placed
    on the description here given Fortunately I had acquired from
    dissecting many much smaller specimens of various cirripedes all
    the advantage which full experience could give me when I commenced
    on Proteolepas

MouthThe mouth is suctorial and is constructed on a different
plan from that in any other cirripede or indeed in any other
as far as I know articulated animal It is narrower in both a
longitudinal and transverse plane than the first segment of the body
and is distinctly separated from it The lower part on the ventral
side is protuberant and rounded The summit is square and is formed
by the crest of the labrum with two large palpi d fig  having
nearly the usual form amongst the Balanin and pointing towards each
other but differently from in any other Cirripede they are united
for their whole length to the labrum and by their extremities to
each other These parts together thus form an arch or hood within
which stand the other gnathites The palpi are roughened by groups
of very minute spines At their bases they can be obscurely seen to
be separated from the rest of the mouth by an oblique joining or
articulation The back of the mouth is formed entirely of the labrum
which becomes narrow towards its base it is from top to bottom
ths of an inch in height Within the hood formed by the palpi
and labrum a pair c fig  of very singular compounded
mandibular organs project freely straight up with their convex outer
edges placed parallel and close together and their teeth pointing
directly from each other so that they stand in a reversed position
compared with the jaws of all other cirripedes and are absolutely
incapable of prehension

This compounded organ is singularly small compared with the palpi and
labrum it is narrow being about ths of an inch in width but
is produced upwards so that a considerable length projects freely
and the rounded properly external margin can be traced down for a
length of about ths of an inch In a lateral view of the mouth
the extreme tip of the mandibular organ could sometimes be seen just
projecting out of the hood The mandibular organ when separated and
carefully examined presents the appearance represented from a camera
drawing in Pl  fig  we here see three groups of teeth of
these the lower set c consists of blunter teeth placed more
transversely and easily separated from the others and altogether
clearly appears like a distinct organ I do not feel nearly so sure
regarding the other two sets my first impression was strongly that
they were distinct organs closely united laterally togetherone
a probably representing the mandibles and formed into a single
large tooth the other b formed of three teeth and probably
representing the outer maxill the firstmentioned set of teeth which
seemed to me to arise from between the other two sets being the inner
maxill If this view and it must be remembered how excessively minute
the parts are be not as I now suspect correct we must suppose
that the outer maxill are aborted and we have seen some tendency
towards this in other cirripedes the compounded organ being formed
only of the mandibles having on this view four teeth and the inner
maxill As far as the mandibles are concerned their existence I may
remark is plainly shown by the presence of the palpi which in all
cases belong to and form part of the mandibles The ventral surface
of the mouth immediately beneath the free portion of the compounded
mandibular organ consists of a triangular projection but I could
see no appearances to make me suppose that this part represented
the outer maxill The compound organin general shape and in the
oblique manner in which the front part is cut off and terminates in
ligamentous apodemes to which muscles are attachedpresents an
unmistakable likeness to a mandible It is hollow within and muscles
appear to extend some way up perhaps to the transversely toothed
portion which represents as I believe the inner maxill these two
groups of teeth anyhow seemed to have some power of sliding over each
other and altered their positions during the course of dissection On
each side of the mouth there is a muscle attached by its lower end
to the basal edge of the labrum and two others one above the other
attached by their lower ends to about the middle of the labrum these
muscles which are distinctly striated or voluntary I infer from
analogy run up to the ligamentous apodemes of the compound mandibles
There appeared to be other more delicate muscles attached to the basal
articulation of the mouth on the ventral face and these I presume
would run to the supposed inner maxill

The mouth in forming a prominence separated by a distinct articulation
from the body and in the union of the palpi and labrum though here
carried to excess is constructed so far on the cirripedial type but
how are we to account for the extraordinary reversed position of the
united mandibles and maxill with their backs almost touching each
other and their toothed edges twisted round so as to face outwards
in a manner unexampled I believe in any other articulate animal It
might perhaps be at first suspected that the compounded mandible had
not really been twisted round but that the teeth had been abnormally
developed on the outer convex margin this view however certainly
cannot be admitted for the properly outer convex margin can be traced
running far down the mouth in a manner utterly inexplicable if this
were really the inner side and equally inexplicable on this view would
be the position of the ligamentous apodemes Hence I cannot doubt
that this compounded mandibular organ has really rotated on its axis
and if the course of development could be followed I suspect that
the twisting would be seen to be effected as follows we know in all
cirripedes that the outer and inner maxill and to a certain extent
the mandibles instead of facing each other are directed towards the
labrum they therefore have already been twisted round a quarter of a
circle as may be seen in the diagram Pl  fig  copied from the
mouth of Ibla Now let us drive inwards the front of the mouth along
a narrow medial line these organs would then fig  be compelled to
turn round a quarter of a circle more and so face directly outwards
In this process the integument between the lower and outer part of
the mandible and the base of the palpus which normally are in close
contact would have to be greatly stretched By a movement of this
order the mandibles would come to stand posteriorly or exteriorly to
the other gnathites and as far as I could make out previously to my
having any theory the large single toothed portion of the compound
organ which most resembles a mandible did really stand outside the
other toothed portion

With respect to the action of this singularly constructed mouth if
its ventral and oblique surface were applied to any yielding object
as the adjoining soft prosoma of the Alepas the compound mandibles
would be worked within an absolutely closed chamber The action of
these mandibles would be to make a transverse slit and subsequently
to serve as a grapnel to keep the mouth closely adpressed to its
prey the other teeth might act in keeping the wound open When the
mouth was thus closely adpressed over a wound the great power of
shortening the whole body which the animal possesses the sophagus
being closed would by the subsequent action of the elasticity of the
outer membrane almost certainly create suction and thus cause the
nutritious juices of the Alepas to flow into the body of the parasite
Hence I have called the mouth suctorial

BodyThis as already stated consists of eleven segments of
which the three posterior abdominal smaller segments can hardly be
distinguished without dissection as separate from each other The
body is mainly occupied by a vast ovarian sack e e fig 
filled by innumerable ova and the three posterior segments by small
testes and their vesicul seminales i but I shall return to
the internal anatomy The outer membrane lined by delicate corium
is thin transparent elastic and covered by groups of excessively
minute blunt little points The segments can be plainly distinguished
by their outlines especially on the ventral surface but they are
rendered unmistakably distinct by the attachment of the muscles they
can also be perceived when the external membrane is perfectly cleaned
by yellowish lines The muscular system is highly symmetrical and
simple along all eleven segments there is a narrow medial ventral
and dorsal clear space on both sides of which space there is a band
of longitudinal muscles which though encroaching on the two sides
and rather largely on the dorsolateral sides may be called the
ventral and dorsal muscles These muscles are striless which is
the case with the homologous posterior thoracic muscles in some other
cirripedes on the dorsal surface lower surface in fig  they are
more spread out and consist on each side of the medial line of four
ribbons this seems to be the case on the ventral side but the ribbons
are here much more confluent in the seventh and eighth segments the
ribbons become broader but in the ninth tenth and eleventh or
three posterior segments they become much narrower and some of the
fasci disappear so that these muscles can hardly be seen from the
outside Each separate ribbon expands a little at its two ends which
are attached to the articulations separating the successive segments
I carefully observed that they did not pass over at either end to the
adjoining segments hence their action must be either simply to shorten
and arch each segment separately or when acting together to shorten
the whole body or perhaps the ventral or dorsal surface by itself

In the first segment and in the three posterior segments these
longitudinal muscles alone occur but on the seven segments from the
second to the eighth inclusive there are other oblique lateroventral
muscles These muscles lie within the longitudinal muscles and
adhere pretty firmly to the coat e e fig  of the great
ovarian sack At their ventral extremities they are attached near the
anterior margin of each segment beneath the point of attachment of
the longitudinal fasci and thence they run posteriorly in an oblique
line to the anterior margin of the next succeeding segment where
they are attached so that these muscles run obliquely from segment
to segment The first of these oblique muscles lying chiefly within
the second segment of the body is thinner and longer than the others
those within the third and fourth segments are short those within the
fifth and succeeding segments extend at their dorsal or lower in
fig  extremities as far as the outer dorsal longitudinal fasci
those within the seventh segment are broad and short and cross the
longitudinal muscles at only a small angle In the eighth segment
there is an oblique lateral muscle like that in the seventh segment
running from the ventral surface towards the dorsal surface but there
is in addition a second oblique lateral muscle rising from the dorsal
surface and running towards the ventral surface This muscle does
not occur in the other segments but in the fourth segment at the
dorsal end of the oblique lateroventral muscle there may be seen
a small branch of fibres at right angles which seems to represent
a muscle homologous with that just mentioned in the eighth segment
obscure traces moreover of similar fibres can be detected in some
of the other segments had these oblique laterodorsal muscles been as
fully developed in the seven anterior segments of the body as on the
eighth segment the whole muscular system would have been perfectly
symmetrical The oblique lateroventral muscle in the sixth segment is
distinctly striated transversely but this is not the case with most
of the other muscles if with any of them I cannot account for this
difference The muscles of the gnathites are the only other voluntary
muscles in the animals body

Homologies of the BodyIt will hereafter be I think clearly
shown that when the shell and integuments of the pupa of Proteolepas
are shed no carapace or general covering for the body is formed the
three anterior segments of the head the backward prolongation of
which as has been elsewhere explained certainly forms the carapace
of ordinary cirripedes being here almost absolutely aborted In every
cirripede the mouth is formed of three pairs of gnathites which no
one will doubt rise from the fourth fifth and sixth segments of
the head here in Proteolepas the mouth even on the view of the
mandibular organ on each side being compounded of only two gnathites
sufficiently resembles the ordinary cirripedial type to make it very
probable that if examined in the earliest stage of its development
three pairs of gnathites would be discovered In accordance with
this conclusion the segment succeeding the mouth i e the
first segment of the body in fig  homologically is the seventh
or last cephalic segment The succeeding seven segments of course
are the seven thoracic segments and the three posterior segments
are abdominal the latter are not developed in ordinary cirripedes
when mature but are present during their pupal condition Now this
conclusion which is in fact deduced from what we know of the front
part of the head in other cirripedes both larval and mature appears
to me most satisfactorily confirmed by the differences in the muscular
system of the segments in Proteolepas In no other way I believe
can it be explained why the last cephalic segment and the three
abdominal segments should differ from the seven thoracic segments
in the entire absence of the oblique lateral muscles The abdominal
segments moreover differ a little in shape in the indistinctness
of their articulation in the thinness of the longitudinal muscles
and even in their contents With respect to the two threads enclosing
the cementducts which spring from the second segment of the body
or first of the thorax and which terminate within the prehensile
antenn of the pupa we shall hereafter see that their apparently most
anomalous position and even the flattened shape of the dorsal surface
of the two anterior segments of the body all accord perfectly with the
homologies just given

Alimentary CanalThe sophagus is thin and for a cirripede short
for it extends only halfway down the first segment i e last
cephalic of the body the lower end which is slightly dilated nearly
touches the anterior end of the great ovarian sack At its upper end
it is surrounded by delicate striless constrictor muscles and there
are others radiating outwards evidently serving to open it the lower
part of the sophagus differently from other cirripedes is destitute
of muscles and is only coated by a thin layer of corium which would
serve to produce a new sophagus at each exuviation Strange as
the fact may be I am prepared to assert that there is no stomach
rectum or anus As I was able to trace so distinctly the sophagus
and likewise the generally far smaller orifice and ducts of the male
generative organs I consider it quite impossible that I could have
missed the stomach The rectum and anus are absent in Alcippe and the
absence of a stomach is here in some degree the less surprising as the
structure of the mouth shows that Proteolepas must live on the already
elaborated fluids of the Alepas to which being a cirripede it is
allied It is of some importance to observe that the sophagus is
fitted with muscles simply for shutting and opening it the wavelike
swallowing action of which other cirripedes are capable being
apparently here impossible but the contraction of the body and its
subsequent expansion the sophagus being opened would allow the blood
of its prey to flow inwards

The nervous system must be much atrophied for I could not detect
it and the small size of the animal is not sufficient to account
for this I wish I could have seen this system for then I should
almost certainly have beheld an articulate animal without a trace of a
suprasophageal ganglion There is no eye but such could hardly be
expected as the anterior cephalic segments are aborted There are
no branchi I may state that within the abdomen along the dorsal
surface there was either a lacuna or a delicate vessel apparently of
a circulatory nature of considerable diameter which near the extreme
posterior end of the body gave out branches

Female Reproductive OrgansThe eight anterior segments of the body
with the exception of a small space at the two ends are occupied by
an immense e e opaque ovarian sack The tissue forming it
is delicate and presents a peculiar cellular aspect it is slightly
attached to the corium on the ventral surface of the body and to the
oblique lateroventral muscles Internally at the anterior end it is
thickly coated by cellular matter the cells varying from ths to
less than th of an inch in diameter becoming in parts confluent
and the whole forming a dark orangecoloured mass In the more central
parts of the sack this cellular matter became aggregated into little
pellets which in proceeding towards the posterior end of the sack
gradually increased in size from about  to ths of an inch in
diameter and at last appeared as almost mature and perfect ova of a
broadly oval figure Their size as we see is small and their number
almost infinite I carefully examined all round this ovarian sack and
could detect no oviducts nor from analogy could they be expected I
have no doubt that the ova burst forth by the rupture probably of the
posterior end of the sack and of the overlying corium and that they
accumulate beneath the external membrane of the body until this is
moulted the rupture beneath being in the meantime healed when they
are freed or perhaps temporarily protected in the old moulted envelope
of the body

On each side within the first two segments of the body and projecting
a little before the great ovarian sack e two gutformed organs
f may be seen even from the outside owing to their opacity and
dark colour They lie near the external surface the first pair of
lateroventral oblique muscles passing between them and the ovarian
sack They are formed of a branching grapelike mass of opaque
orangecoloured cells They are intimately united at their posterior
extremities to the ovarian sack and I believe open into it but I
cannot say that I demonstrated this From their absolute identity in
structure and similarity in position namely on each side of the
lower end of the sophagus no doubt is left on my mind that these
bodies answer to the true ovaria which are situated within the body of
other cirripedes and that the ovarian sack answers to the inosculating
and branching ovarian tubes and cca which fill the peduncle or cover
the basis in other cirripedes but here from the absence of these
parts necessarily occupying the body

Male OrgansThe whole surface of the ovarian sack the space before
it even to within the lower parts of the mouth the posterior half of
the last thoracic segment and especially the whole three abdominal
segments are completely netted by branching delicate vessels or ducts
terminating in spherical glands about th of an inch in diameter
These little glands include a brownish pulpy centre and sufficiently
resemble the testes of other cirripedes in appearance position and
connecting ducts to make me believe that such is their nature I
may remark that in the more central parts of the abdomen the glands
and ducts seemed to be in process of formation by the confluence of
cellular matter and in some other cirripedes I have suspected that
the testes are periodically renewed or at least redeveloped from
an undistinguishable condition Within the posterior half of the
abdomen some of the ducts become thicker and unite others joining in
laterally so as together to make a dark chord ths of an inch
in diameter Until dissecting this chord I thought it was a single
vesicula seminalis but it separated into several rather thick ducts
or vesicul I was not able to remove from within them the contained
matter but it appeared very finely and longitudinally flocculent like
spermatozoa not quite matured In accordance with the immature state of
the contents of the ovarian sack in all probability these ducts would
hereafter have become greatly enlarged and have formed a compound
vesicula seminalis of considerable size The dark chord formed
by their union contracts as it enters the rudimentary penis and
terminates in a very minute orifice on its apex The penis consists of
a papilla only ths of an inch in length situated on the extreme
point of the abdomen but rather towards the ventral surface

MetamorphosisIn accordance with the general law of the correlation
of parts it may be inferred from the description and measurements
of the pupal antenn immediately to be given that this abnormal
creature was developed within a pupa of the same general structure
and of about the size as the pup whence Scalpellum Alcippe and
many other cirripedes are developed As the ova are of remarkably
small size indeed I have seen no others quite so small it is certain
that the larv as in the case with all other cirripedes excepting
Cryptophialus must undergo several metamorphoses and increase much in
size before attaining their pupal condition

AttachmentThe animal is attached as already stated to the
sack of the Alepas by two threads rising close together from the
mediodorsal line near the posterior end of the second segment of
the body These threads are attached likewise close together at their
further ends by the antenn into which they enter They are flattened
and strong yet quite flexible with a somewhat sinuous surface they
were in this specimen ths of an inch in length and a little
above ths in diameter where joined to the thoracic segment they
were a little contracted Their structure in this specimen could be
made out Pl  fig  with perfect distinctness Their transparent
outer tunic e fig  is ths of an inch in thickness and is
continuous with that d enveloping the whole body but is abruptly
and considerably thicker than this membrane and hence a very slight
collar is formed outside round the line of junction of each thread
with the body The delicate corium c lining the external membrane
of the body runs at least someway down these threads It was likewise
indisputably evident that the membrane b for I separated it by
dissection forming the great ovarian sack together with the cellular
contents of this sack a entered and extended down both threads
It should also be particularly observed that the coarsely cellular
matter within the ovarian sack immediately that it entered the tube
formed by the membrane of the ovarian sack suddenly changed its
appearance into a homogeneous stiff pulpy matter which retained the
same appearance all down the threads to within the antenn This finer
matter readily separated from the coarser cellular matter within the
sack but was not divided from it by any septum or membrane Some way
within the threads the corium the membrane of the ovarian sack and
the contents appear e as seen from the outside to become and
perhaps really are blended together These threads could not have
been originally formed of their present length and must therefore
have been added to during the growth of the animal but from their
entering the notmoulted antenn and from the animal being permanently
attached by them they cannot have grown by means of the moulting of
their integuments hence I conclude that at each period of growth and
exuviation they have been added to only at their upper ends where
there is a sort of collar or line of growth and where I may remark
the lining corium is alone well developed We shall presently see the
bearing of these remarks

These threads contract to about half their former diameter as they
enter the old prehensile antenn of the pupa within which they are
firmly attached Each thread with its three tunics apparently blended
together can be traced to the extremity of the discsegment g
where the included matter seems to have burst forth The whole disc and
the terminal segment of both antenn are enveloped close together
in cement formed into two almost separate little capsules by which
they adhere very firmly to the integuments of the Alepas The cement
required to be removed before the antenn could be plainly seen The
cement presented all the usual characters namely its homogeneous
laminated structure and its yellowish colour The cement in the case
of the male Ibla which is parasitic within the sack of the female
Ibla affects the corium and fibrous matter beneath the chitinetunic
and causes them to adhere together and thus prevents the male from
being cast off each time that the inner tunic of the sack of the female
is moulted exactly so has the cement of the Proteolepas affected
the integuments of the Alepas The only difference between ordinary
cementducts and the two threads here described is that the ducts
in both cases formed by the prolongation of the coat of an ovarian
receptacle are here protected by a thick outer membrane lined at
least in the upper part by corium whereas in the Lepadid the two
ducts are included within the peduncle and are therefore protected by
one common membrane lined of course by corium and this membrane we
shall presently see is homologous with that separately investing the
two threads

The antenn differ remarkably little considering the anomalous
character of the mature animal from the same organ in other genera
they come nearest perhaps to the antenn of Ibla The length of the
disc g fig  and great succeeding segment f together is
ths of an inch The lower segment has its basal articulation
only slightly oblique showing that as in Alcippe and Ibla it was
probably articulated near the anterior end of the pupal shell it is
of nearly the same width throughout The disc g is remarkable
from its great proportional length it is hoofshaped with the outer
side rather protuberant and the end pointed The ultimate segment
h is of moderate size as in Ibla it has a shoulder or notch on
its inner side near its end bearing two long spines and probably
there were originally three or four spines on the square broad upper
end but these have been broken This segment is articulated unusually
near to the end of the disc

     As I have given the measurements of the antenn in so many
    genera I will give these second f fig  segment ths
    of an inch in length and ths in width Disc ths
    in length and ths in width Ultimate segment ths 
    in length and ths  in breadth

The foregoing remarks on the two threads by which Proteolepas is
attached are independently of their relation to this individual
animal of considerable interest In my volume on the Lepadid I have
stated after repeated and rigorous examinations for I was well aware
how singular the facts were that in Conchoderma aurita and in
some other genera the cementducts which entered the pupal antenn
could be traced till they joined a gland the coat of which gland was
absolutely continuous with the coats of the adjoining and continuous
ovarian tubes of which it was only a modified portion and what was
still more remarkable that the matter within the gland was continuous
with and differed only from the cellular matter within the ovarian
tubes and cca from which ova were in the act of formation by being
more homogeneous and more coherent Furthermore I have shown that
in Ibla an ovarian tube becomes by a very small change namely by
a double flexure and slight thickening of its coat converted into a
gland and thus acquires the power of affecting the cellular ovarian
matter and changing it into cement Now in Proteolepas the great
ovarian sack replaces the ovarian tubes and cca and we here see
the very same relations even still more plainly for the coat of the
ovarian sack is indisputably continuous with that investing or forming
the two cementducts within the two threads and immediately that
the coarse cellular matter which within the ovarian sack is being
converted into ova enters the upper contracted end of the cementduct
by some power we must suppose inherent in its coat it is converted
into cement which debouches with all its usual properties through the
pupal antenn I may venture to reaffirm that nothing could be plainer
than this structure or be in more striking conformity with my previous
observations given in the introduction to the Lepadid

                                   

I can hardly express the perplexity which I felt when I first examined
Proteolepas and when I naturally mistook the mouth for the entire
head for I saw as I thought the antenn in direct connection with
the second segment of the body posteriorly to the mouth It was quite
as monstrous and incredible an inversion of the laws of nature as
those fabulous halfhuman monsters with an eye seated in the middle
of their stomachs After a time I perceived that the following
considerations removed all difficulty and brought Proteolepas into the
type of other cirripedes

Firstly in ordinary cirripedes the two cementducts can be traced
up from the cemented antenn to the glands formed by a part of the
ovarian branching cca and the latter can be traced to where they
enter as two simple tubes the body of the animal at a mediodorsal
point a little anteriorly to the prosoma or second thoracic
segment From what is actually seen in the complemental male
of Scalpellum Peronii and from what may be inferred from the
structure of these parts in the pup of all cirripedes there can be
no doubt that if the ovarian cca were in any case not developed the
cementducts would enter the body at the spot where the two simple
ovarian tubes which serve to unite the ovarian cca with the true
ovaria do enter Now if we look at the drawing Pl  fig  of
Proteolepas we shall see that the cementducts enter the body at a
mediodorsal point a little anteriorly to the second thoracic segment
and therefore in the normal position

     This may be partially seen in the section fig  of
    Balanus on the same plate  with the figure of Proteolepas
    here bearing in mind that Balanus is a much modified form
    z shows the pupal antenn within which whilst young the
    cementducts are included and are directly continuous with the
    layer of branching ovarian cca g which are prolonged up
    to the ovaria as a pair of simple tubes only one being here
    represented entering the body above the upper margin of the
    prosoma c The prosoma of Balanus I may add answers to
    the segment  t in fig  of Proteolepas e the mouth
    in Balanus of course corresponding with m the mouth of
    Proteolepas the segment  c and  t of the latter are in
    Balanus aborted or confluent at least on the ventral surface and
    lastly the whole great shell of Balanus the sack with its muscles
    and the branchi and the opercular valves with their muscles are
    all represented in Proteolepas merely by the outer membrane of the
    two threads g which enter the pupal antenn

Secondly the external membrane of the two threads investing the two
cementducts it should be remembered is not moulted and is added to
during growth being lined internally by corium only round the upper
collarlike edge

Thirdly the external covering or carapace of every young cirripede
at the period of its metamorphosis enters at its lower end the
cemented antenn in the form of two short tubular prolongations
by which alone at first the cirripede adheres to the surface of
attachment within these prolongations the cementducts are included I
have moreover seen instances as in Conchoderma aurita and in the
male of Ibla and Alcippe in which these tubular prolongations lined
internally by corium were increased a little in length so as to form
a trouserlike termination to the peduncle That the forked extremity
should be a little more developed and so be converted into a pair of
short tubular threads cannot be considered as very improbable

Fourthly in the male Ibla the capitulum is so much atrophied that it
does not enclose the thorax or mouth but still an elongated support or
peduncle is left But it would be no very violent assumption to imagine
the peduncle which does not essentially differ from the capitulum to
become likewise rudimentalto grow smaller and smaller and shorter
and shorter till the merest remnant was left at the spot where it
entered the cemented antenn And in the last paragraph it has been
shown that it would be no violent assumption to imagine this lower end
of the peduncle where it enters the antenn developed into two short
threadlike prolongations

Lastly it is certain from the existence of the prehensile antenn
that Proteolepas was developed within a pupa probably differing in no
very essential respect from the pup of other cirripedes Therefore in
accordance with all analogy we may believe that the position of
the young Proteolepas probably much coiled up with a deep fold close
under the mouth within the pupa the general form and structure of
the latter and the course of the cementducts did not essentially
differ from the imaginary figure given Pl  fig  Now at the
period of the metamorphosis let us imagine that no general covering
or carapace was formed except a small portion on the ventral surface
round the cemented antenn Let us further suppose this remnant to be
specially developed as in the case of some cirripedes into a short
trouserlike prolongation entering the antenn and subsequently in
accordance with the almost universal laws of growth in cirripedes that
this portion was never moulted but continued to be added to during
growth only at its upper end By this means we should produce every
leading peculiarity of the Proteolepas bivincta As this parasite
lives within the sack of another cirripede and is protected by the
capitulum of the latter we can understand in accordance with the
usual admirable economy of nature the absence of any general covering
for its body We can now also understand the structure and manner of
growth of the two threads by which it is bound to its prey and the
connection at first so strange and perplexing between the old pupal
antenn and the second segment of the thorax I am convinced that no
other explanation than that here given will accord with the relations
of the several parts and organs of Proteolepas Consequently I fully
believe that we here see an articulate animal in which the whole of
the three anterior segments of the head have been during the act
of metamorphosis absolutely aborted with the exception of a mere
rudiment on the ventral surface near the anterior end round the old
antenn and which rudiment has been specially developed as a covering
for the two cementducts As the pupal antenn are homologically the
second pair of antenn we may further infer that this modified remnant
of the carapace investing the two threads belongs to the third
cephalic segment

     Any one who has not specially attended to the metamorphoses
    of ordinary cirripedes who looks at the imaginary figure of
    the young Proteolepas will feel much surprise at the relative
    positions of the parts for the mouth and the first and even
    second segments of the body stand posteriorly i e above in
    the figure to the succeeding segments of the body in relation to
    the carapace of the pupa but this is only in accordance with the
    remarkable change in position as explained in the introduction
    p  pl  fig  amounting almost to inversion which the
    whole thorax of every young cirripede undergoes within the pupa
    whilst the anterior cephalic portions and general covering are
    developed conformably with the pupal carapace whence it arises
    that the dorsal surface of that part of the thorax immediately
    succeeding the mouth becomes attached to the ventral internal
    surface of the carapace I believe that the peculiar flattened
    dorsal outline of the first two segments of the body of Proteolepas
    is due to these parts having been formed in contact as represented
    in pl  fig  with the straight ventral surface of the
    carapace of the pupa To place the young Proteolepas and at the
    same time the carapace of the pupa with all the parts in proper
    homological sequence it would be necessary to seize the posterior
    end of the abdomen a and pull till the dorsal surfaces of the
    first and second segments of the body separated from the ventral
    internal surface of the carapace and stood posteriorly i e
    above in figure to the mouth which latter would thus also have to
    rotate a quarter of a circle so that the orifice would come to be
    directed outwards Then every part would stand in accordance with
    the archetype crustacean structure in due order but the three
    confluent anterior cephalic segments forming the front part and
    carapace of the pupa would as in the case of all cirripedes be
    of disproportionately large size in relation to the rest of the
    body

   Since the table on the distribution of the fossil species was

        Wood which show that Balanus concavus and Hameri are found
        in the Red Crag and that Verruca Strmia is found in the

        ten and in the Red Crag eight I should however add that
        the identification of Verruca Strmia in the two Crags is
        a little doubtful as the specimen was without the opercular
