When you looked outside it was into darkness

Going out yourself you could let your eyes accommodate At high noon
the sun was a sharp spark in a dusky heaven and its light amounted to
about oneninth of one percent of what Earth gets The great fields
of ice and frozen gases reflected enough to help vision but upthrust
crags and cliffs of naked rock were like blackened teeth

Seventy hours later when Triton was on the other side of the primary
that it always faced there was a midnight thick enough to choke you
The stars flashed and glittered a steely twinkle through a gaunt
atmosphere mostly hydrogenstrange to see the old lost constellations
of Earth here on the edge of the deep Neptune was at the full a
giant sprawling across eight degrees of sky bluish gray and smoky
banded but it caught so little sunlight that men groped in blindness
They set up floodlights or had lamps glaring from their tracs to work
at all

But nearly everything went on indoors Tunnels connected the various
buildings on the Hill instruments were of necessity designed to
operate in the open without needing human care men rarely had occasion
to go out any more Which was just as well for it takes considerable
power and insulation to keep a man alive when the temperature hovers
around  degrees Kelvin

And so you stood at a meterthick port of insulglas and looked out
and saw only night

Thomas Gilchrist turned away from the view with a shudder He had
always hated cold and it was as if the bitterness beyond the labdome
had seeped in to touch him The cluttered gleam of instruments in the
room desk piled high with papers and microspools the subdued chatter
of a computer chewing a problem were comforting

He remembered his purpose and went with a long lowgravity stride to
check the mineralogical unit It was busily breaking down materials
fetched in by the robosamplers stones never found on Earthbecause
Earth is not the Mercurysized satellite of an outer planet nor has
it seen some mysterious catastrophe in an unknown time back near
the beginning of things Recording meters wavered needles across
their dials data tapes clicked out he would soon have the basic
information Then he would try to figure out how the mineral could have
been formed and give his hypothesis to the computer for mathematical
analysis of possibility and start on some other sample

For a while Gilchrist stood watching the machine A cigaret smoldered
forgotten between his fingers He was a short pudgy young man
with unkempt hair above homely features Paleblue eyes blinked
nearsightedly behind contact lenses his myopia was not enough to
justify surgery Tunic and slacks were rumpled beneath the gray smock

Behold the bold pioneer he thought His selfdeprecating sarcasm
was mildly nonsane he knew but he couldnt stopit was like biting
an aching tooth Only a dentist could fix the tooth in an hour while
a scarred soul took years to heal It was like his eyes the trouble
wasnt bad enough to require long expensive repair so he limped
through life

Rafael Alemn came in small and dark and cheerful Allo he said
How goes it He was one of the Hills organic chemists as Gilchrist
was the chief physical chemist but his researches into lowtemperature
properties were turning out so disappointingly that he had plenty of
time to annoy others Nevertheless Gilchrist liked him as he liked
most people

Soso It takes time

Time we have enough of mi amigo said Alemn Two years we ave
been here and three years more it will be before the ship comes to
relieve us He grimaced Ah when I am back to Durango Unit how fast
my savings will disappear

You didnt have to join the Corps and you didnt have to volunteer
for Triton Station Gilchrist pointed out

The little man shrugged spreading slender hands Confidential I will
tell you I had heard such colorful tales of outpost life But the only
result is that I am now a married mannot that I have anything but
praise for my dear MeiHua but it is not the abandonment one had hoped
for

Gilchrist chuckled Outerplanet stations did have a slightly lurid
reputation and no doubt it had been justified several years ago

After allThe voyage was so long and costly that it could not be
made often You established a selfsufficient colony of scientists
and left it there to carry on its researches for years at a time
But selfsufficiency includes psychic elements recreation alcohol
entertainment the opposite sex A returning party always took several
children home

Scientists tended to be more objective about morals or at least more
tolerant of the other fellows than most so when a hundred or so
people were completely isolated and ordinary amusements had palled it
followed that there would be a good deal of what some would call sin

Not Triton said Gilchrist You forget that theres been another
cultural shift in the past generationmore emphasis on the stable
family And I imagine the Old Man picked his gang with an eye to such
attitudes Resultthe wouldbe rounders find themselves so small a
minority that it has a dampening effect

S I know But you ave never told me your real reason for coming
here Thomas

Gilchrist felt his face grow warm Research he answered shortly
There are a lot of interesting problems connected with Neptune

Alemn cocked a mildly skeptical eyebrow but said nothing Gilchrist
wondered how much he guessed

That was the trouble with being shy In your youth you acquired
bookish tastes only a similarly oriented wife would do for you so
you didnt meet many women and didnt know how to behave with them
anyhow Gilchrist who was honest with himself admitted hed had
wistful thoughts about encountering the right girl here under informal
conditions where

He had And he was still helpless

Suddenly he grinned Ill tell you what he said I also came
because I dont like cold weather

Came to Neptune

Sure On Earth you can stand even a winter day so you have to Here
since the local climate would kill you in a second or two youre
always well protected from it Gilchrist waved at the viewport Only
I wish they didnt have that bloody window in my lab Every time I look
out it reminds me that just beyond the wall nitrogen is a solid

Yo comprendo said Alemn The power of suggestion Even now at
your words I feel a chill

Gilchrist started with surprise You know somehow I have the
sameJust a minute He went over to a workbench His inframicrometer
had an air thermometer attached to make temperature corrections

What the devil he muttered It is cooled off Only  degrees in
here Its supposed to be 

Some fluctuation in temperature as in ozone content and humidity
reminded Alemn That is required for optimum health

Not this time of day it shouldnt be varying Gilchrist was reminded
of his cigaret as it nearly burned his fingers He stubbed it out and
took another and inhaled to light it

Im going to raise Jahangir and complain he said This could play
merry hell with exact measurements

Alemn trotted after him as he went to the door It was manually
operated and the intercoms were at particular points instead of every
room You had to forego a number of Earthside comforts here

There was a murmuring around him as he hurried down the corridor
Some doors stood open showing the various chemical and biological
sections The physicists had their own dome on the other side of the
Hill and even so were apt to curse the stray fields generated here If
they had come this far to get away from solar radiations it was only
reasonable as anyone but a chemist could see that

The screen stood at the end of the hall next to the tunnel stairs
Gilchrist checked himself and stood with a swift wild pulse in his
throat Catherine Bardas was using it

He had often thought that the modern fashion of outbreeding yielded
humans more handsome than any pure racial type could be When a girl
was half Greek and half Amerind and a gifted biosynthesizer on top of
it a man like him could only stare

Mohammed Jahangirs brown bearded face registered more annoyance
than admiration as he spoke out of the screen Yes Dr Bardas he
said with strained courtesy I know My office is being swamped with
complaints

Well whats the trouble asked the girl Her voice was low and
gentle even at this moment

Im not sure said the engineer The domes temperature is dropping
thats all We havent located the trouble yet but it cant be
serious

All Im asking said Catherine Bardas patiently is how much longer
this will go on and how much lower its going to get Im trying to
synthesize a cell and it takes precisely controlled conditions If the
air temperature drops another five degrees my thermostat wont be able
to compensate

Oh well  Im sure you can count on repair being complete before
that happens

All right said Catherine sweetly If not though Ill personally
bung you out the main airlock sans spacesuit

Jahangir laughed and cut off The light of fluorotubes slid blueblack
off the girls shoulderlength hair as she turned around Her face was
smooth and dark with high cheekbones and a lovely molding of lips and
nose and chin

Ohhello Tom she smiled All through here

ThththNever mind he fumbled I was only ggoing to ask about it
myself

Well She yawned and stretched with breathtaking effect I suppose
Id better get back and

Ah why so seorita replied Alemn If the work does not need your
personal attention just now come join me in a leetle drink It is near
dinnertime anyhow

All right she said How about you Tom

He merely nodded for fear of stuttering and accompanied them down the
stairs and into the tunnel Half of him raged at his own timiditywhy
hadnt he made that suggestion

The passages connecting the domes were all alike straight featureless
holes lined with plastic Behind lay insulation and the pipes of the
common heating system then more insulation finally the Hill itself
That was mostly porous iron surprisingly pure though it held small
amounts of potassium and aluminum oxides The entire place was a spongy
ferrous outcropping But then Triton was full of geological freaks

How goes your work asked Alemn sociably

Oh pretty well said Catherine I suppose you know weve
synthesized virus which can live outside Now were trying to build
bacteria to do the same

On a professional level Gilchrist was not a bad conversationalist
His trouble was that not everyone likes to talk shop all the time Is
there any purpose in that other than pure research to see if you can
do it he inquired I cant imagine any attempt ever being made to
colonize this moon

Well you never know she answered If theres ever any reason for
it oxidereducing germs will be needed

As well as a nuclear heating system for the whole world andWhat
do your life forms use for energy though Hardly enough sunlight I
should think

Oh but there is for the right biochemistry with the right
catalystsanalogous to our own enzymes It makes a pretty feeble type
of life of course but I hope to get bacteria which can live off the
local ores and frozen gases by exothermic reactions Dont forget when
its really cold a thermal engine can have a very high efficiency and
all living organisms are thermal engines of a sort

They took the stairs leading up into the main dome apartments
refectories social centers and offices Another stair led downward
to the central heating plant in the body of the Hill Gilchrist saw an
engineer going that way with a metering kit and a worried look

The bar was crowded this was cocktail hour for the swing shift
andpopular opinion to the contrarya scientist likes his meals
regular and only lives off sandwiches brought to the lab when he must
They found a table and sat down Nobody had installed dial units so
junior technicians earned extra money as waiters One of them took
their orders and chits

The ventilators struggled gallantly with the smoke It hazed the murals
with which some homesick soul had tried to remember the green Earth A
couple of astronomers at the next table were noisily disputing theories

Dammit Plutos got to be an escaped satellite of Neptune Look at
their orbits  and Pluto is where Neptune should be according to
Bodes Law

I know Ive heard that song before I suppose you favor the Invader
theory

What else will account for the facts A big planet comes wandering in
yanks Neptune sunward and frees Pluto but Neptune captures a satellite
of the Invader Tritons got to be a captured body with this screwy
retrograde orbit And Nereid

Have you ever analyzed the mechanics of that implausible proposition
Look here A pencil came out and began scribbling on the
longsuffering table top

Catherine chuckled I wonder if well ever find out she murmured

Gilchrist rubbed chilled fingers together Blast it the air was still
cooling off Itd be interesting to land a ship on Nep himself and
check the geology he said A catastrophe like that would leave
traces

When they can build a ship capable of landing on a major planet
without being squeezed flat by the air pressure thatll be the day I
think well have to settle for telescopes and spectroscopes for a long
long time to come

The girls voice trailed off and her dark fine head poised The
loudspeaker was like thunder

DR VESEY DR VESEY PLEASE CONTACT ENGINEERING OFFICE DR VESEY
PLEASE CONTACT DR JAHANGIR OVER

For a moment there was silence in the bar

I wonder what the trouble is said Alemn

Something to do with the heating plant I suppose Again
Catherines tones died and they stared at each other

The station was a magnificent machine it represented an engineering
achievement which would have been impossible even fifty years ago It
kept a hundred human creatures warm and moist it replenished their air
and synthesized their food and raised a wall of light against darkness
But it had not the equipment to call across nearly four and a half
billion kilometers of vacuum It had no ship of its own and the great
Corps vessel would not be back for three years

It was a long way to Earth

                                   

Dinner was a silent affair that period There were a few lowvoiced
exchanges but they only seemed to deepen the waiting stillness

And the cold grew apace You could see your breath and your thin
garments were of little help

The meal was over and the groups of friends were beginning to drift
out of the refectory when the intercoms woke up again This chamber
had a vision screen Not an eye stirred from Director Samuel Vesey as
he looked out of it

His lips were firm and his voice steady but there was a gleam of sweat
on the ebony skindespite the cold He stared directly before him and
spoke

Attention all personnel Emergency situation Your attention please

After a moment he seemed to relax formality and spoke as if face to
face Youve all noticed our trouble Something has gone wrong with
the heating plant and Dr Jahangirs crew havent located the trouble
so far

Now theres no reason for panic The extrapolated curve of temperature
decline indicates that at worst itll level off at about zero
Centigrade That wont be fun but we can stand it till the difficulty
has been found Everyone is advised to dress as warmly as possible
Food and air plant crews are going on emergency status All projects
requiring energy sources are cancelled till further notice

According to the meters theres nothing wrong with the pile Its
still putting out as much heat as it always has But somehow that heat
isnt getting to us as it should The engineers are checking the pipes
now

Ill have a stat of the findings made up and issued Suggestions are
welcome but please take them to my officethe engineers have their
own work to do Above all dont panic This is a nuisance I know but
theres no reason to be afraid

All personnel not needed at once stand by The following specialists
please report to me

He read off the list all physicists and closed his talk with a forced
grin and thumbs up

As if it had broken a dam the message released a babble of words
Gilchrist saw Catherine striding out of the room and hastened after her

Where are you going he asked

Where do you think she replied To put on six layers of clothes

He nodded Best thing Ill come along if I maymy rooms near
yours

A woman still in her smock was trying to comfort a child that
shivered and cried A Malayan geologist stood with teeth clattering in
his jaws An engineer snarled when someone tried to question him and
ran on down the corridor

What do you think asked Gilchrist inanely

I dont have any thoughts about the heating plant said Catherine
Her voice held a thin edge Im too busy worrying about food and air

Gilchrists tongue was thick and dry in his mouth The biochemistry of
food creation and oxygen renewal died when it got even chilly

                                   

Finished dressing they looked at each other in helplessness Now what

The temperature approached its minimum in a nosedive There had
always been a delicate equilibrium it couldnt be otherwise when
the interior of the domes was kept at nearly  degrees above the
surrounding world The nuclear pile devoted most of its output to
maintaining that balance with only a fraction going to the electric
generators

Gilchrist thrust hands which were mottled blue with cold into his
pockets Breath smoked white before him Already a thin layer of
hoarfrost was on ceiling and furniture

How long can we stand this he asked

I dont know said Catherine Not too long I should think since
nobody has adequate clothes The children should  suffer  pretty
quickly Too much drain on body energy She clamped her lips together
Use your mental training You can ignore this till it begins actually
breaking down your physique

Gilchrist made an effort but couldnt do it He could stop shivering
but the chill dank on his skin and the cold sucked in by his nose
were still there in his consciousness like a nightmare riding him

Theyll be dehumidifying the air said Catherine Thatll help
some She began walking down the hall I want to see what theyre
doing about the food and oxy sections

A small mob had had the same idea It swirled and mumbled in the hall
outside the service rooms A pair of hardlooking young engineers armed
with monkey wrenches stood guard

Catherine wormed her way through the crowd and smiled at them Their
exasperation dissolved and one of them a thickset redhead by the
name of OMallory actually grinned Gilchrist standing moodily behind
the girl could hardly blame him

Hows it going in there she asked

Well now I suppose the Old Man is being sort of slow about his
bulletins said OMallory Its under control here

But what are they doing

Rigging electric heaters of course Itll take all the juice we have
to maintain these rooms at the right temperature so Im afraid theyll
be cutting off light and power to the rest of the Hill

She frowned Its the only thing I suppose But what about the
people

Theyll have to jam together in the refectories and clubrooms Thatll
help keep em warm

Any idea what the trouble is

OMallory scowled Well get it fixed he said

That means you dont know She spoke it calmly

The piles all right he said We telemetered it Ida done that
myself but you know how it is He puffed himself up a trifle They
need a couple husky chaps to keep the crowd orderly Anyhow the piles
still putting out just as it should still at  degrees like it ought
to be In fact its even a bit warmer than that why I dont know

Gilchrist cleared his throat Thththen the trouble is with the 
heating pipes he faltered

How did you ever guess asked OMallory with elaborate sarcasm

Lay off him said Catherine Were all having a tough time

Gilchrist bit his lip It wasnt enough to be a tonguetied idiot he
seemed to need a womans protection

Trouble is of course said OMallory the pipes are buried in
insulation behind good solid plastic Theyll be hard to get at

Whoever designed this farce ought to have to live in it said his
companion savagely

The same designs worked on Titan with no trouble at all declared
OMallory

Catherines face took on a grimness There never was much point in
making these outerplanet domes capable of quick repair she said If
something goes wrong the personnel are likely to be dead before they
can fix it

Now now thats no way to talk smiled OMallory Look I get off
duty at  Care to have a drink with me then

Catherine smiled back If the bars operating sure

Gilchrist wandered numbly after her as she left

The cold gnawed at him He rubbed his ears unsure about frostbite Odd
how fast you got tiredIt was hard to think

Id better get back to my lab and put things away before they turn off
the electricity to it he said

Good idea Might as well tidy up in my own place Something flickered
darkly in the girls eyes Itll take our minds off

Off gloom and cold and the domes turned to blocks of ice and a final
night gaping before all men Off the chasm of loneliness between the
Hill and the Earth

They were back in the chemical section when Alemn came out of his lab
The little mans olive skin had turned a dirty gray

What is it Gilchrist stopped and something knotted hard in his guts

Madre de Dos Alemn licked sandy lips We are finished

Its not that bad said Catherine

You do not understand he shrieked Come here

They followed him into his laboratory He mumbled words about having
checked a hunch but it was his hands they watched Those picked up a
Geiger counter and brought it over to a wall and traced the path of a
buried heating pipe

The clicking roared out

                                   

Beta emission said Gilchrist His mouth felt cottony

How intense whispered Catherine

Gilchrist set up an integrating counter and let it run for a while
Low he said But the dosage is cumulative A week of this and
well begin to show the effects A month and were dead

Theres always some small beta emission from the pipes said the
girl A little tritium gets formed down in the pile room
Its  never been enough to matter

Somehow the piles beginning to make more H then Gilchrist sat
down on a bench and stared blankly at the floor

The laws of nature Alemn had calmed down a bit but his eyes were
rimmed with white

Yes asked Catherine when he stopped She spoke mostly to fend off
the silence

I ave sometimes thought  what we know in science is so leetle It
may be the whole universe it has been in a  a most improbable state
for the past few billion years Alemn met her gaze as if pleading
to be called a liar It may be that what we thought to be the laws of
nature those were only a leetle statistical fluctuation

And now were going back onto the probability curve muttered
Gilchrist He shook himself No damn it I wont accept that till I
must Theres got to be some rational explanation

Leakage in the pipes ventured Catherine

Wed know that Nor does it account for the radiation No its His
voice twisted up on him and he groped out a cigaret Its something
natural

What is natural said Alemn How do we know leetle creeping things
as we are living only by the grace of God We ave come one long way
from home His vision strayed to the viewport with a kind of horror

Yes thought Gilchrist in the chilled darkness of his mind yes we
have come far Four and a half billion kilometers further out from the
sun The planetsized moon of a world which could swallow ours whole
without noticing A thin hydrogen atmosphere glaciers of nitrogen
which turn to rivers when it warms up ammonia snow and a temperature
not far above absolute zero What do we know What is this arrogance of
ours which insists that the truth on Earth is also the truth on the rim
of space

No

He stood up shuddering with cold and said slowly Wed better go see
Dr Vesey He has to know and maybe they havent thought to check the
radiation And then

Catherine stood waiting

Then we have to think our way out of this mess he finished lamely
Lets uh start from the beginning Think back how thththe heating
plant works

                                   

Down in the bowels of the Hill was a great manmade cave It had been
carved out of the native iron with rough pillars left to support the
roof walls and ceiling were lined with impermeable metal but the
floor was in its native statewho cared if there was seepage downward

The pile sat there heart and life of the station

It was not a big one just sufficient to maintain man on Triton
Part of its energy was diverted to the mercuryvapor turbines which
furnished electricity The rest went to heat the domes above

Now travel across transJovian spaces is long and costly even the
smallest saving means much Very heavy insulation against the haze of
neutrons which the pile emitted could scarcely be hauled from Earth
nor had there been any reason to spend time and labor manufacturing it
on Triton

Instead pumps sucked in the hydrogen air and compressed it to about
 atmospheres There is no better shield against highenergy
neutrons they bounce off the light molecules and slow down to a speed
which makes them perfectly harmless laggards which dont travel far
before decaying into hydrogen themselves This as well as the direct
radiation of the pile turned the room hotsome  degrees

So what was more natural than that the same hydrogen should be
circulated through pipes of chromevanadium steel which is relatively
impenetrable even at such temperatures and heat the domes

There was of course considerable loss of energy as the compressed gas
seeped through the Hill and back into the satellites atmosphere But
the pumps maintained the pressure It was not the most efficient system
which could have been devised it would have been ludicrous on Earth
But on Triton terminal of nowhere men had necessarily sacrificed some
engineering excellence to the stiff requirements of transportation and
labor

And after all it had worked without a hitch for many years on Saturns
largest moon It had worked for two years on Neptunes

                                   

Samuel Vesey drummed on his desk with nervous fingers His dark
countenance was already haggard the eyes sunken and feverish

Yes he said Yes it was news to me

Jahangir put down the counter The office was very quiet for a while

Dont spread the word said Vesey Well confine it to the
engineers Conditions are bad enough without a riot breaking loose We
can take several days of this radiation without harm but you know how
some people are about it

Youve not been very candid so far snapped Catherine Just exactly
what have you learned

Jahangir shrugged There was a white frost rimming his beard Thereve
been no bulletins because theres no news he replied We checked the
pile Its still putting out as it should The neutron flux density is
the same as ever Its the gas there and in our pipes which has gotten
cold and  radioactive

Have you looked directly in the pile roomactually entered demanded
Alemn

Jahangir lifted his shoulders again My dear old chap he murmured
At a temperature of  and a pressure of  After a moment he
frowned I do have some men modifying a trac so it could be driven
in there for a short time But I dont expect to find anything Its
mostly to keep them busy

How about the pipes then asked Gilchrist

Internal gas pressure and velocity of circulation is just about what
it always has been According to the meters anyway which I dont
think are lying I dont want to block off a section and rip it out
except as a last resort It would just be wasted effort Im sure
Jahangir shook his turbanned head No this is some phenomenon which
well have to think our way through not bull through

Vesey nodded curtly I suggest you three go back to the common rooms
he said Well be shunting all the power to food and oxy soon If you
have any further suggestions pass them on  otherwise sit tight

It was dismissal

                                   

The rooms stank

Some ninety human beings were jammed together in three long chambers
and an adjacent kitchen The ventilators could not quite handle that
load

They stood huddled together children to the inside while those on
the rim of the pack hugged their shoulders and clenched teeth between
blue lips Little was said So far there was calm of a sortenough
personnel had had intensive mind training to be a steadying influence
but it was a thin membrane stretched near breaking

As he came in Gilchrist thought of a scene from Dantes hell
Somewhere in that dense mass a child was sobbing The lights were
dimhe wondered whyand distorted faces were whittled out of thick
shadow

Ggget inside  in front of me he said to Catherine

Ill be all right answered the girl Its a fact that women can
stand cold better than men

Alemn chuckled thinly But our Thomas is well padded against it he
said

Gilchrist winced He himself made jokes about his figure but it was
a coverup Then he wondered why he should care theyd all be dead
anyway before long

A colleague Danton turned empty eyes on them as they joined the rest
Any word he asked

Theyre working on it said Catherine shortly

God Wont they hurry up Ive got a wife and kid And we cant even
sleep its so cold

Yes thought Gilchrist that would be another angle Weariness to eat
away strength and hope  radiation would work fast on people in a
depressed state

They could at least give us a heater in here exclaimed Danton His
tone was raw Shadows muffled his face and body

All the juice we can spare is going to the food and air plants No use
being warm if you starve or suffocate said Catherine

I know I know ButWell why arent we getting more light There
ought to be enough current to heat the plants and still furnish a
decent glow in here

Something else Gilchrist hesitated Something else is operating
then and sucking a lot of power I dont know what

They say the pile itself is as hot as ever Why cant we run a pipe
directly from it

And get a mess of fast neutrons Catherines voice died After
all  they were being irradiated as they stood here and trembled

Weve got batteries It was almost a snarl from Dantons throat
Batteries enough to keep us going comfortably for days Why not use
them

And suppose the trouble hasnt been fixed by the time theyre
drained challenged Gilchrist

Dont say that

Take it easy advised another man

Danton bit his lip and faced away mumbling to himself

A baby began to cry There seemed no way of quieting it

Turn that bloody brat off The tone came sawtoothed from somewhere
in the pack

Shut up A womans voice close to hysteria

Gilchrist realized that his teeth were rattling He forced them to
stop The air was foul in his nostrils

He thought of beaches under a flooding sun of summer meadows and a
long sweaty walk down dusty roads he thought of birds and blue sky
But it was no good None of it was real

The reality was here just beyond the walls where Neptune hung ashen
above glittering snow that was not snow where a thin poisonous wind
whimpered between barren snags where the dark and the cold flowed
triumphantly close The reality would be a block of solid gas a
hundred human corpses locked in it like flies in amber it would be
death and the end of all things

He spoke slowly through numbed lips Why has man always supposed that
God cared

We dont know if He does or not said Catherine But man cares
isnt that enough

Not when the next nearest man is so far away said Alemn trying to
smile I will believe in God man is too small

Danton turned around again Then why wont He help us now he cried
Why wont He at least save the children

I said God cared answered Alemn quietly not that He will do our
work for us

Stow the theology you two said Catherine Were going to pieces in
here Cant somebody start a song

Alemn nodded Who has a guitar When there was no response he began
singing a capella

    La cucaracha la cucaracha
    Ya no quiere caminar

Voices joined in selfconsciously They found themselves too few and
the song died

Catherine rubbed her fingers together Even my pockets are cold now
she said wryly

Gilchrist surprised himself he took her hands in his That may help
he said

Why thank you Sir Galahad she laughed YouOh Hey there

OMallory off guard detail now that everyone was assembled here came
over He looked even bulkier than before in half a dozen layers of
clothing Gilchrist who had been prepared to stand impotently in the
background while the engineer distributed blarney was almost relieved
to see the fear on him He knew

Any word asked Catherine

Not yet he muttered

Why ave we so leetle light inquired Alemn What is it that draws
the current so much Surely not the heaters

No Its the pump The airintake pump down in the pile room
OMallorys voice grew higher Its working overtime sucking in more
hydrogen Dont ask me why I dont know Nobody does

Wait said Catherine eagerly If the rooms losing its warm gas and
having to replace it from the cold stuff outside would that account
for the trouble were having

No said OMallory dully We cant figure out where the hydrogens
disappearing to and anyway it shouldnt make that much difference The
energy output down theres about what its supposed to be you know

Gilchrist stood trying to think His brain felt gelid

But damn it damn it damn it there must be a rational answer He
couldnt believe they had blundered into an ugly unknown facet of the
cosmos Natural law was the same here or in the farthest galaxyit
had to be

Item he thought wearily The pile was operating as usual except that
somehow hydrogen was being lost abnormally fast and therefore the pump
had to bring in more from Tritons air But

Item That couldnt be due to a leak in the heating pipes because
they were still at their ordinary pressure

Item The gas in the pipes included some radioactive isotope
Nevertheless

Item It could not be hydrogen because the pile was working
normally and its neutron leakage just wasnt enough to produce that
much Therefore some other element was involved

Carbon There was a little methane vapor in Tritons atmosphere But
not enough Anyway carbon was a stable isotope and the pileroom
conditions wouldnt produce carbon Unless

Wait a minute Something flickered on the edge of awareness

Danton had buttonholed OMallory We were talking about using the
battery banks he said

The engineer shrugged And what happens after theyre used up No
were keeping them as a last resort His grin was hideous We could
get six or seven comfortable days out of them

Then lets have them If you thumbfingered idiots havent fixed the
system by then you deserve to die

And youll die right along with us laddybuck OMallory bristled
Dont think the black gangs loafing Were taking the cold and the
radiation as much as you are

Radiation

Faces turned around Gilchrist saw eyes gleam white The word rose in a
roar and a woman screamed

Shut up bawled OMallory frantically Shut up

Danton shouted and swung at him The engineer shook his head and hit
back As Danton lurched a man rabbitpunched OMallory from behind

Gilchrist yanked Catherine away The mob spilled over a sudden storm
He heard a table splinter

Someone leaped at him He had been an educated man a most scientific
and urbane man but he had just been told that hard radiation was
pouring through his body and he ran about and howled Gilchrist
had a glimpse of an unshaven face drawn into a long thin box with
terror then he hit The man came on ignoring blows his own fists
windmilling Gilchrist lowered his head and tried clumsily to take the
fury on his arms Catherine he thought dizzily Catherine was at least
behind him

The man yelled He sat down hard and gripped his stomach retching
Alemn laughed shortly A good kick is advisable in such unsporting
circumstances mi amigo

Come on gasped Catherine Weve got to get help

They fled down a tunnel of blackness The riot noise faded behind and
there was only the hollow slapping of their feet

Lights burned ahead Veseys office A pair of engineer guards tried to
halt them Gilchrist choked out an explanation

Vesey emerged and swore luridly out of hurt and bewilderment at his
own people And we havent a tear gas bomb or a needler in the place
He brooded a moment then whirled on Jahangir who had come out behind
him Get a tank of compressed ammonia gas from the chem section and
give em a few squirts if theyre still kicking up when you arrive
That ought to quiet them without doing any permanent damage

The chief nodded and bounded off with his subordinates In this
gravity one man could carry a goodsized tank

Vesey beat a fist into his palm There was agony on his face

Catherine laid a hand on his arm Youve no choice she said gently
Ammonia is rough stuff but it would be worse if children started
getting trampled

Gilchrist leaning against the wall straightened It was as if a bolt
had snapped home within him His shout hurt their eardrums

Ammonia

Yes said Vesey dully What about it Breath smoked from his mouth
and his skin was rough with gooseflesh

IIIIts your  yyyour answer

                                   

They had set up a heater in his laboratory so he could work but the
test was quickly made Gilchrist turned from his apparatus and nodded
grinning with victory That settles the matter This sample from the
pile room proves it The air down there is about half ammonia

Vesey looked redeyed at him There hadnt been much harm done in the
riot but there had been a bad few minutes Hows it work he asked
Im no chemist

Alemn opened his mouth then bowed grandly You tell him Thomas It
is your moment

Gilchrist took out a cigaret He would have liked to make a cavalier
performance of it with Catherine watching but his chilled fingers
were clumsy and he dropped the little cylinder She laughed and picked
it up for him

Simple he said With technicalities to discuss he could speak well
enough even when his eyes kept straying to the girl What we have
down there is a Haber process chamber Its a method for manufacturing
ammonia out of nitrogen and hydrogenobsolete now but still of
interest to physical chemists like myself

I havent tested this sample for nitrogen yet but theres got to be
some because ammonia is NH Obviously theres a vein of solid
nitrogen down under the Hill As the heat from the pile room penetrated
downward this slowly warmed up Some of it turned gaseous generating
terrific pressure and finally that pressure forced the gas up into the
pile room

Now when you have a nitrogenhydrogen mixture at  degrees and 
atmospheres in the presence of a suitable catalyst you get about a 
percent yield of ammonia

You looked that up said Catherine accusingly

He chuckled My dear girl he said there are two ways to know a
thing you can know it or you can know where to look it up I prefer
the latter After a moment Naturally this combination decreases
the total volume of gas so the pump has to pull in more hydrogen from
outside to satisfy its barystat and more nitrogen is welling from
below all the time Weve been operating quite an efficient little
ammonia factory down there though it should reach equilibrium as to
pressure and yield pretty soon

The Haber process catalyst incidentally is spongy iron with certain
promoterspotassium and aluminum oxides are excellent ones In other
words it so happened that the Hill is a natural Haber catalyst which
is why weve had this trouble

And I suppose the reaction is endothermic and absorbs heat asked
Catherine

No  as a matter of fact its exothermic which is why the pile
is actually a little hotter than usual and that in spite of having
to warm up all that outside air But ammonia does have a considerably
higher specific heat than hydrogen So while the gas in our pipes has
the same caloric content it has a lower temperature

Ummm Vesey rubbed his chin And the radiation

Nitrogen plus neutrons gives carbon a beta emitter

All right said Catherine Now tell us how to repair the situation

Her tone was lightafter all the answer was obviousbut it didnt
escape Gilchrist that she had asked him to speak Or was he thinking
wishfully

We turn off the pile empty the pipes and go into the room in
spacesuits he said Probably the simplest thing would be to drill
an outlet for the nitrogen vein and drop a thermite bomb down
there  that should flush it out in a hurry Or maybe we can lay an
impermeable floor In any event it shouldnt take more than a few
days which the batteries will see us through Then we can go back to
operation as usual

Vesey nodded Ill put Jahangir on it right away He stood up and
extended his hand As for you Dr Gilchrist youve saved all our
lives and

Shucks His cheeks felt hot It was my own neck too

Before his selfconfidence could evaporate he turned to Catherine
Since we cant get back to work for a few days how about going down
to the bar for a drink I believe itll soon be functioning again
And uh therell doubtless be a dance to celebrate later

I didnt know you could dance she said

I cant he blurted

They went out together It is not merely inorganic reactions which
require a catalyst

Section   General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone  For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support


Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included  Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility

     httpwwwgutenbergorg

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenbergtm
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks
