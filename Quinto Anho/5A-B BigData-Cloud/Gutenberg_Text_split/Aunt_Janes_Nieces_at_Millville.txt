CHAPTER I

UNCLE JOHNS FARM

How did I happen to own a farm asked Uncle John interrupting his
soup long enough to fix an inquiring glance upon Major Doyle who
sat opposite

By virtue of circumstance my dear sir replied the Major composedly
Its a part of my duty in attending to those affairs you wont look
afther yourself to lend certain sums of your money to needy and
ambitious young men who want a start in life

Oh Uncle Do you do that exclaimed Miss Patricia Doyle who sat
between her uncle and father and kept an active eye upon both

So the Major says answered Uncle John dryly

And its true asserted the other Hes assisted three or four score
young men to start in business in the last year to my certain
knowledge by lending them sums ranging from one to three thousand
dollars And its the most wasteful and extravagant charity I ever
heard of

But Im so glad cried Patsy clapping her hands with a delighted
gesture Its a splendid way to do goodto help young men to get a
start in life Without capital you know many a young fellow would
never get his foot on the first round of the ladder

And many will never get it there in any event declared the Major
with a shake of his grizzled head More than half the rascals that John
helps go to the dogs entirely and hang us up for all theyve borrowed

I told you to help deserving young men remarked Uncle John with a
scowl at his brotherinlaw

And how can I tell whether theyre desarving or not retorted Major
Doyle fiercely Do ye want me to become a sleuth or engage detectives
to track the objects of your erroneous philanthropy I just have to form
a judgment an take me chances and whin a poor devil goes wrong I
charge your account with the loss

But some of them must succeed ventured Patsy in a conciliatory tone

Some do said John Merrick and that repays me for all my trouble

All your throuble sir queried the Major you mane all my
throublewell and your money And a heap of throuble that confounded
farm has cost me with one thing and another

What of it retorted the little round faced millionaire leaning back
in his chair and staring fixedly at the other Thats what I employ
you for

Now now gentlemen cried Patsy earnestly Ill have no business
conversation at the table You know my rules well enough

This isnt business asserted the Major

Of course not agreed Uncle John mildly No one has any business
owning a farm How did it happen Major

The old soldier had already forgotten his grievance He quarreled
persistently with his wealthy employer and brotherinlawwhom he
fairly adoredto prevent the possibility as he often confided to
Patsy of his falling down and worshiping him John Merrick was a
multimillionaire to be sure but there were palliating circumstances
that almost excused him He had been so busily occupied in industry that
he never noticed how his wealth was piling up until he discovered it by
accident Then he promptly retired to give the other fellows a
chance and he now devoted his life to simple acts of charity and the
welfare and entertainment of his three nieces He had rescued Major
Doyle and his daughter from a lowly condition and placed the former in
the great banking house of Isham Marvin  Company where John Merricks
vast interests were protected and his income wisely managed He had
given Patsy this cosy little apartment house at  Willing Square and
made his home with her from which circumstance she had come to be
recognized as his favorite niece

John Merrick was sixty years old He was short stout and chubbyfaced
with snowwhite hair mild blue eyes and an invariably cheery smile
Simple in his tastes modest and retiring lacking the education and
refinements of polite society but shrewd and experienced in the affairs
of the world the little man found his greatest enjoyment in the family
circle that he had been instrumental in founding Being no longer
absorbed in business he had come to detest its every detail and so
allowed his bankers to care for his fortune and his brotherinlaw to
disburse his income while he himself strove to enjoy life in a shy and
boyish fashion that was as unusual in a man of his wealth as it was
admirable He had never married

Patricia was the apple of Uncle Johns eye and the one goddess
enshrined in her doting fathers heart Glancing at her as she sat here
at table in her plain muslin gown a stranger would be tempted to wonder
why She was redhaired freckled as a robins egg pugnosed and
widemouthed But her blue eyes were beautiful and they sparkled with a
combination of saucy mischief and kindly consideration for others that
lent her face an indescribable charm

Everyone loved Patsy Doyle and people would gaze longer at her
smilinglips and dancing eyes than upon many a more handsome but less
attractive face She was nearly seventeen years old not very tall and
her form to speak charitably was more neat than slender

A while ago said the Major resuming the conversation as he carved
the roast a young fellow came to me who had invented a new sort of
pump to inflate rubber tires He wanted capital to patent the pump and
put it on the market The thing looked pretty good John so I lent him
a thousand of your money

Quite right returned Uncle John nodding

But pretty soon he came back with a sad tale He was in a bad fix
Another fellow was contesting his patent and fighting hard to head him
off It would take a lot of money to fight backthree thousand at
least But he was decent about it after all His father had left him a
little farm at Millville He couldnt say what it was worth but there
were sixty acres and some good buildings and he would deed it to you as
security if you would let him have three thousand more

So you took the farm and gave him the money

I did sir Perhaps I am to blame but I liked the young fellows
looks He was cleancut and frank and believed in his pump I did more
At the climax of the struggle I gave another thousand making five
thousand in all

Well

Its gone John and youve got the farm The other fellows were too
clever for my young friend Joseph Wegg and knocked out his patent

Im so sorry said Patsy sympathetically

The Major coughed

Its not an unusual tale my dear especially when John advances the
money he replied

What became of the young man asked the girl

Hes a competent chauffeur and so he went to work driving an
automobile

Where is Millville inquired Uncle John thoughtfully

Somewhere at the north of the State I believe

Have you investigated the farm at all

I looked up a real estate dealer living at Millville and wrote him
about the Wegg farm He said if any one wanted the place very badly it
might sell for three thousand dollars

Humph

But his best information was to the effect that no one wanted it at
all

Patsy laughed

Poor Uncle John she said

The little man however was serious For a time he ate with great
deliberation and revolved an interesting thought in his mind

Years ago said he I lived in a country town and I love the smell
of the meadows and the hum of the bees in the orchards Any orchards at
my farm Major

Dont know sir

Pretty soon continued Uncle John its going to be dreadfully hot in
New York and well have to get away

Seashores the place remarked the Major Atlantic City or
Swampscott or

Rubbish growled the other man impatiently The girls and I have
just come from Europe Weve had enough sea to last us all this
season at least What we pine for is country lifepure milk apple
trees and new mown hay

We Uncle said Patsy

Yes my dear A couple of months on the farm will do all of my nieces
good Beth is still with Louise you know and they must find the city
deadly dull just now The farms the thing And the Major can run up to
see us for a couple of weeks in the hot weather and well all have a
glorious lazy time

And we can take Mary along to do the cooking suggested Patsy
entering into the idea enthusiastically

And eat in our shirtsleeves said Uncle John with a glowing face

And have a cow and some pigs cried the girl

Pah said the Major scornfully You talk as if it were a real farm
instead of a place no one would have as a gift

Uncle John looked sober again

Anyone live on the place Major he inquired

I believe not Its gone to ruin and decay the last few years

But it could be put into shape

Perhaps so at an expense that will add to your loss

Never mind that

If you want farm life why dont you rent a respectable farm demanded
the Major

No this is my farm I own it and its my bounded duty to live on it
said Uncle John stubbornly Write to that real estate fellow at
Millville tomorrow and tell him to have the place fixed up and put into
shipshape order as quickly as possible Tell him to buy some cows and
pigs and chickens and hire a man to look after them Also a horse and
buggy some saddle horses

Go slow John Dont leave such a job to a country real estate dealer
If I remember right the fellow wrote like a blacksmith If you want
horses and rigs let Hutchinson send you down the right sort with an
experienced groom and stable hands But Im not sure there will be a
place to put them

Oh Uncle exclaimed Patsy dont let us have all those luxuries Let
us live a simple life on the farm and not degrade its charms by adding
city fixins The cow and the chickens are all right but lets cut out
the horses until we get there Dont you know dear that a big
establishment means lots of servants and servants mean worry and
strife I want to let down the bars for the cow when she moos and milk
her myself

It takes a skilled mechanic to milk a cow objected the Major

But Patsys right cried her uncle with conviction We dont want
any frills at all Just tell your man Major to put the place into good
living condition

Patrichia softly remarked the Major with an admiring glance at his
small daughter has more sinse in her frizzled head than both of us put
together

If she hadnt more than you retorted Uncle John with a grin Id
put a candle inside her noodle and call her a JackLantern



CHAPTER II

THE AGENT

The Major hunted up the real estate dealers former letter as soon as he
reached his office next morning The printed letterhead somewhat
blurred because too much ink had been used read as follows

  Marshall McMahon McNutt
  Real Estate Dealer  Horses to Pasture
  by the week or month

  Also Plymouth Rock Hens  Road Commissioner
  Agent for Radleys Lives of the Saints
  Insurance and Watermelons My Specialty

  Millville Mount County NY

The Major shook his head doubtfully as he read the above announcement
but Mr McNutt was the only known person to whom he could appeal to
carry out John Merricks orders So he dictated the following letter


Dear Sir

Mr John Merrick the present owner of the Wegg farm at Millville
desires to spend his summer vacation on the premises and therefore
requests you to have the house and grounds put in firstclass shape as
soon as possible and to notify me directly the work is done Have the
house thoroughly cleaned the grass mowed around it and the barns and
outbuildings repaired wherever it may be necessary You are also
instructed to procure for Mr Merricks use a good Jersey cow some pigs
and a dozen or so barnyard fowls As several ladies will accompany the
owner and reside with him on the place he would like you to report what
necessary furniture if any will be required for their comfort Send
your bill to me and it will receive prompt attention

After several days this reply came

Mister Doyle you must be crazy as a loon Send me fifty cold dollars as
an evvidence of good fayth and I wull see what can be done Old Hucks is
livin on the place yit do you want him to git out or what Yours fer a
square deal Marshall McMahon McNutt

John said the Major exhibiting this letter youre on the wrong
tack The man is justified in thinking were crazy Give up this idea
and think of something else to bother me

But the new proprietor of the Wegg farm was obdurate During the past
week he had indulged in sundry sly purchases which had been shipped in
his name to Chazy Junction the nearest railway station to Millville
Therefore the die had been cast as far as Mr Merrick was concerned
for the purchases were by this time at the farm awaiting him and he
could not back out without sacrificing them They included a set of
gardening tools several hammocks croquet and tennis sets and a
remarkable collection of fishing tackle which the sportinggoods man
had declared fitted to catch anything that swam from a whale to a
minnow Also Uncle John decided to dress the part of a rural gentleman
and ordered his tailor to prepare a corduroy fishing costume a suit of
white flannel one of khaki and some oldfashioned blue jean overalls
with apron front which when made to order by the obliging tailor cost
about eighteen dollars a suit To forego the farm meant to forego all
these luxuries and Mr Merrick was unequal to the sacrifice Why only
that same morning he had bought a charming cottage piano and shipped it
to the Junction for Patsys use That seemed to settle the matter
definitely To be balked of his summer vacation on his own farm was a
thing Mr Merrick would not countenance for a moment

Give me that letter Major he said Ill run this enterprise
myself

The Major resigned with a sigh of relief

Uncle John promptly sent the real estate agent a draft for five hundred
dollars with instructions to get the farm in shape for occupancy at the
earliest possible day

If Old Hucks is a farm hand and a bachelor he wrote let him stay
till I come and look him over If hes a married man and has a family
chuck him out at once Im sure you are a man of good taste and
judgment Look over the furniture in the house and telegraph me what
condition it is in Everything about the place must be made cozy and
comfortable but I wish to avoid an appearance of vulgarity or
extravagance

The answer to this was a characteristic telegram

Furniture on the bum like everything else Will do the best I can
McNutt

Uncle John did not display this discouraging report to Patsy or her
father A little thought on the matter decided him to rectify the
deficiencies in so far as it lay in his power He visited a large
establishment making a specialty of furnishing homes complete and
ordered a new kitchen outfit including a modern range a mission style
outfit for a diningroom dainty summer furniture for the five chambers
to be occupied by his three nieces the Major and himself and a variety
of lawn benches chairs etc

Look after the details he said to the dealer Dont neglect anything
that is pretty or useful

I wont sir replied the man who knew his customer was the great
John Merrick who could furnish a city complete if he wished to and
not count the cost

Everything was to be shipped in haste to the Junction and Uncle John
wrote McNutt to have it delivered promptly to the farm and put in order

As soon as things are in shape he wrote wire me to that effect and
Ill come down But dont let any grass grow under your feet Im a man
who requires prompt service

The days were already getting uncomfortably warm and the little man was
nervously anxious to see his farm So were the nieces for that matter
who were always interested in the things that interested their eccentric
uncle Besides Patricia Doyle whom we have already introduced these
nieces were Miss Louise Merrick who had just celebrated her eighteenth
birthday and Miss Elizabethor BethDe Graf now well past fifteen
Beth lived in a small town in Ohio but was then visiting her city
cousin Louise so that both girls were not only available but eager to
accompany Uncle John to his new domain and assist him to enjoy his
summer outing



CHAPTER III

MILLVILLE HEARS EXCITING NEWS

Millville is rather difficult to locate on the map for the railroads
found it impossible to run a line there Chazy Junction the nearest
station is several miles away and the wagon road ascends the foothills
every step of the distance Finally you pass between Mount Parnassus
whoever named it that and Little Bill Hill and find yourself on an
almost level plateau some four miles in diameter with a placid lake in
the center and a fringe of tall pines around the edge At the South
where tower the northern sentries of the Adirondacks a stream called
Little Bill Creek comes splashing and dashing over the rocks to force
its way noisily into the lake When it emerges again it is humble and
sedate and flows smoothly to Hookers Falls from whence it soon joins
a tributary that leads it to far away Champlain

Millville is built where the Little Bill rushes into the lake The old
mill with its race and sluicegates still grinds wearily the scanty
dole of grain fed into its hoppers and Silas Caldwell takes his toll and
earns his modest living just as his father did before him and Little
Bill Thompson did before him

Above the mill a rickety wooden bridge spans the stream for here the
highway from Chary Junction reaches the village of Millville and passes
the wooden structures grouped on either side its main street on the way
to Thompsons Crossing nine miles farther along The town boasts
exactly eleven buildings not counting the mill which being on the
other side of the Little Bill can hardly be called a part of Millville
proper Cottings Store contains the postoffice and telephone booth and
is naturally the central point of interest Seth Davis blacksmith shop
comes next Widow Clarks Emporium for the sale of candy stationery and
cigars adjoins that McNutts office and dwelling combined is next and
then Thornes Livery and Feed Stables You must understand they are not
set close together but each has a little ground of its own On the
other side of the street is the hardware store with farm machinery
occupying the broad platform before it and then the Millville House a
twostoried hotel with a shedlike wing for the billiardroom and card
tables Nib Corkins drug store jewelry store and music store combined
with sewing machines for a side line is the last of the business
establishments and the other three buildings are dwellings occupied by
Sam Cotting Seth Davis and Nick Thorne

Dick Pearsons farm house is scarcely a quarter of a mile up the
highway but it isnt in Millville for all that Theres a cross lane
just beyond Pearsons leading east and west and a mile to westward is
the Wegg Farm in the wildest part of the foothills

It is a poor farming country around Millville Strangers often wonder
how the little shops of the town earn a living for their proprietors
but it doesnt require a great deal to enable these simple folk to live
The tourist seldom penetrates these inaccessible foothills the roads
are too rough and primitive for automobiles so Millville is shamefully
neglected and civilization halted there some half a century ago

However there was a genuine sensation in store for this isolated
hamlet and it was the more welcome because anything in the way of a
sensation had for many years avoided the neighborhood

Marshall McMahon McNutt or as he was more familiarly called by those
few who respected him most highly Marsh McNutt and sundry other
appellations by those who respected him not at all became the
recipient of a letter from New York announcing the intention of a
certain John Merrick the new owner of the Wegg Farm to spend the
summer on the place McNutt was an undersized man of about forty with a
beardless face scraggly buffcolored hair and eyes that were big
light blue and remarkably protruding The stare of those eyes was
impenetrable because observers found it embarrassing to look at them
Macs friends had a trick of looking away when they spoke to him but
children gazed fascinated at the expressionless blue eyeballs and
regarded their owner with awe

The real estate agent was considered an enterprising man by his
neighbors and a poor stick by his wife He had gone to school at
Thompsons Crossing in his younger days had a call to preach but
failed because he couldnt get religion inherited a farm from his
uncle and married Sam Cottings sister whose tongue and temper were so
sharp that everyone marveled at the mans temerity in acquiring them
Finally he had lost one foot in a mowing machine and the accident
destroyed his further usefulness to the extent of inducing him to
abandon the farm and move into town Here he endeavored to find
something to do to eke out his meagre income so he raised thoroughbred
Plymouth Rocks selling eggs for hatching to the farmers doctored sick
horses and pastured them in the lot back of his barn the rear end of
which was devoted to watermelons in season sold subscription books to
farmers who came to the mill or the village store was elected road
commissioner and bossed the neighbors when they had to work out their
polltax and turned his hand to any other affairs that offered a
pennys recompense The real estate business was what Seth Davis
labeled a blobbering bluff for no property had changed hands in the
neighborhood in a score of years except the lot back of the mill which
was traded for a yoke of oxen and the Wegg farm which had been sold
without the agents knowledge or consent

The only surprising thing about the sale of the Wegg farm was that
anyone would buy it Captain Wegg had died three years before and his
son Joe wandered south to Albany worked his way through a technical
school and then disappeared in the mazes of New York So the homestead
seemed abandoned altogether except for the Huckses

When Captain Wegg died Old Hucks his hired man and Hucks blind wife
Nora were the only dependents on the place and the ancient couple had
naturally remained there when Joe scorned his inheritance and ran away
After the sale they had no authority to remain but were under no
compulsion to move out so they clung to their old quarters

When McNutt was handed his letter by the postmaster and storekeeper he
stared at its contents in a bewildered way that roused the loungers to
amused laughter

Whats up Peggy called Nick Thorne from his seat on the counter
Somebody gone offn me hooks an left ye a fortun

Peggy was one of McNutts most popular nicknames acquired because he
wore a short length of pine where his absent foot should have been

Not quite was the agents slow reply but heres the blamedest
funniest communicate a man ever got Its from some critter that knows
the man what bought the Wegg farm

Lets hear it remarked Cotting the storekeeper a fat individual
with a bald head who was counting matches from a shelf into the public
matchbox He allowed the boys just twenty free matches a day

So the agent read the letter in an uncertain halting voice and when he
had finished it the little group stared at one another for a time in
thoughtful silence

Wall Ill be plunked finally exclaimed the blacksmith Looks like
the fellers rich dont it

Ef hes rich what the tarnation blazes is he comin here for
demanded Nib Corkins the dandy of the town I was over t Huntingdon
las year n seen how the rich folks live Boys this haint no place
for a man with money

That depends responded Cotting gravely Im sure wed all be better
off if we had a few real bloods here to squander their substance

Well heres a perposal to squander all right said McNutt But the
question is Does he know what hes runnin up agin and what itll
cost to do all the idiotic things as he says

Probly not answered the storekeeper

Its the best built farm house round thest parts announced the
miller who had been silent until now Old Wegg were a seacapn once
an rich He dumped a lot o money inter that place an never got it
out agin nuther

Course not Sixty acres o cobblestone dont pay much divvydends
that I ever hearn tell on replied Seth

Theres some good fruit though continued Caldwell an the berries
allus paid the taxes an left a little besides Ol Hucks gits along
all right

Jest lives n thats all

Well thets enough said the miller Its about all any of us do
aint it

Do ye take it this ere Merricks goin to farm er what asked Nib
speculatively

I take it hes plumb crazy retorted the agent rubbing the fringe of
hair behind his ears One things certain boys I dont do nuthin
foolish till I see the color of his money

Make him send you ten dollars in advance suggested Seth

Make him send fifty amended the storekeeper You cant buy a cow
an pigs an chickens an make repairs on much less

By jinks I will cried McNutt slapping his leg for emphasis Ill
strike him fer a cool fifty an if the feller dont pay he kin go to
blazes Thems my sentiments boys an Ill stand by em

The others regarded him admiringly so the energetic little man stumped
away to indite his characteristic letter to Major Doyle

If the first communication had startled the little village the second
fairly plunged it into a panic of excitement Peggys hand trembled as
he held out the five hundred dollar draft and glared from it to his
cronies with a white face

Suffrin Jehu gasped Nick Thorne Is it good

The paper was passed reverently around and examined with a succession
of dubious headshakes

Send for Bob West suggested Cotting Hes seen more o that sort o
money than any of us

The widow Clarkes boy who was present ran breathlessly to fetch the
hardware dealer who answered the summons when he learned that Peggy
McNutt had received a check for five hundred dollars

West was a tall lean man with shrewd eyes covered by horn spectacles
and a stubby gray mustache He was the potentate of the town and reputed
to be worth at a conservative estimate in the neighborhood of ten
thousand dollarser more fer that matter fer Bob aint tellin his
business to nobody Hardware and implements were acknowledged to be
paying merchandise and West lent money on farm mortgages besides He
was a quiet man had a good library in his comfortable rooms over the
store and took the only New York paper that found its way into
Millville After a glance at the remittance he said

Its a draft on Isham Marvin  Company the New York bankers Good as
gold McNutt Where did you get it

A lunitic named John Merrick him thats bought the Capn Wegg farm
sent it on Heres his letter Bob

The hardware dealer read it carefully and gave a low whistle

There may be more than one John Merrick he said thoughtfully But
Ive heard of one who is many times a millionaire and a power in the
financial world What will you do for him McNutt to expend this money
properly

Blesst if I know answered the man his eyes bulging with a helpless
look What n thunder kin I do Bob

West smiled

I dont wish to interfere in business matters said he but it is
plainly evident that the new owner wishes the farm house put into such
shape that it will be comfortable for a man accustomed to modern
luxuries You dont know much about such things Mac and Mr Merrick
has made a blunder in employing your services in such a delicate matter
But do the best you can Ride across to the Wegg place and look it over
Then get Taft the carpenter to fix up whatever is necessary Ill sell
you the lumber and nails and youve got more money than you can
probably use Telegraph Mr Merrick frankly how you find things but
remember the report must not be based upon your own mode of life but
upon that of a man of wealth and refinement Especially he must be
posted about the condition of the furniture which I can guess is
illsuited to his needs

How bout Hucks asked the agent

They all hung eagerly on Wests reply for Old Hucks was a general
favorite The fact that the old retainer of the Weggs had a blind wife
to whom he was tenderly devoted made the proposition of his leaving the
farm one of intense interest Old Hucks and his patient wife had not
been so much hired help as a part of the Wegg establishment and it
was doubtful if they had ever received any wages It was certain that
Hucks had not a dollar in the world at the present time and if turned
out of their old home the ancient couple must either starve or go to the
poorhouse

Say nothing further about Old Hucks or his wife to Mr Merrick
advised West gravely When the owner comes he will need servants and
Hucks is a very capable old fellow Let that problem rest until the time
comes for solution If the old folks are to be turned out make John
Merrick do it it will put the responsibility on his shoulders

By dum yer right Bob exclaimed McNutt slapping the counter with
his usual impulsiveness Ill do the best I kin for the rich man an
let the poor man alone

After an examination of the farm house and other buildings which seemed
in his eyes almost palatial and a conference with Alonzo Taft the
carpenter the agent began to feel that his task was going to prove an
easy one He purchased a fine Jersey cow of Will Johnson sold his own
flock of Plymouth Rocks at a high price to Mr Merrick and hired Ned
Long to work around the yard and help Hucks mow the grass and clean up
generally

But now his real trouble and bewilderment began A carload of new
furniture and fixins was sidetracked at the junction and McNutt was
ordered to get it unloaded and carted to the farm without delay There
were four hayrack loads of the truck altogether and when it was all
dumped into the big empty barn at the Wegg farm the poor agent had no
idea what to do with it

See here said Nick Thorne who had done the hauling youve got to
let a woman inter this deal Peggy

Thats what my wife says gumtwist her

Keep yer ol woman outn it Shed spile a rotten apple

Who then Nick

Why schoolteachers the right one I guess Theyve got a vacation
now an likely shell come over here an put things to rights Peggy
that air new furnitures the rambunctionest stuff thet ever come inter
these parts an itll make the ol house bloom like a rose in Spring
But folks like us haint got no call to tech it You fetch
schoolteacher

Peggy sighed He was keeping track of his time and charging John Merrick
at the rate of two dollars a day being firmly resolved to make hay
while the sun was shining and absorb as much of the money placed in his
hands as possible To let schoolteacher into this deal and be obliged
to pay her wages was an undesirable thing to do yet he reflected that
it might be wise to adopt Nick Thornes suggestion

So next morning he drove the liverymans sorrel mare out to Thompsons
Crossing where the brick schoolhouse stood on one corner and Will
Thompsons residence on another A mile away could be seen the spires of
the little church at Hookers Falls

McNutt hitched his horse to Thompsons post walked up the neat pebbled
path and knocked at the door

Ethel in he asked of the sadfaced woman who after some delay
answered his summons

Shes in the garden weedin

Ill go round said the agent

The garden was a bower of roses Among them stood a slender girl in a
checked gingham tying vines to a trellis

Mornn Ethel said the visitor

The girl smiled at him She was not very pretty because her face was
long and wan and her nose a bit onesided But her golden hair sparkled
in the sun like a mass of spun gold and the smile was winning in its
unconscious sweetness Surely such attractions were enough for a mere
country girl

Ethel Thompson had however another claim to distinction She had been
eddicated as her neighbors acknowledged in awed tones and took a
diploma from a college school at Troy Young as she was Ethel had
taught school for two years and might have a life tenure if she cared
to retain the position As he looked at her neat gown and noted the
grace and ease of her movements the agent acknowledged that he had
really come to the right shop to untangle his perplexing difficulties

New folks is comin to the Capn Wegg farm he announced as a
beginning

She turned and looked at him queerly

Has Joe sold the place she asked

Near a year ago Some fool rich man has bought it and is comin down
here to spend his summer vacation he says Here read his letters
Theyll explain it better n I can

Her hand trembled a little as she took the letters McNutt pulled from
his pocket Then she sat upon a bench and read them all through By that
time she had regained her composure

The gentleman is somewhat eccentric she remarked but he will make
no mistake in coming to this delightful place if he wishes quiet
and rest

Dont know what hes after Im sure replied the man But hes sent
down enough furniture an truck to stock a hotel an I want to know ef
youll go over an put it in the rooms an straighten things out

Me

Why yes Youve lived in cities some an know how citified things go
Contwist it Ethel theres things in the bunch that neither I ner Nick
Thorne ever hearn tell of much less knowin what theyre used for

The girl laughed

When are the folks coming she asked

When I git things in shape Theyve sent some money down to pay fer
whats done so you wont have to work fer nuthin

I will though responded the girl in a cheery tone It will delight
me to handle pretty things Are Nora and Tom still there

Oh yes I had orders to turn the Huckses out ye see but I didnt do
it

Im glad of that she returned brightly Perhaps we may arrange it so
they can stay Old Noras a dear

But shes blind

She knows every inch of the Wegg house and does her work more
thoroughly than many who can see When do you want me Peggy

Soons you kin come

Then Ill be over tomorrow morning

At that moment a wild roar like that of a beast came from the house
The sad faced woman ran down a passage a door slammed and then all was
quiet again

McNutt hitched uneasily from the wooden foot to the good one

Hows ol Will he enquired in a low voice

Grandfathers about as usual replied the girl with trained
composure

Still crazy as a bedbug

At times he becomes a bit violent but those attacks never last long

Dont spose I could see him ventured the agent still in hesitating
tones

Oh no he has seen no visitor since Captain Wegg died

Well goodbye Ethel See you at the farm in the mornin

The girl sat for a long time after McNutt had driven away seemingly
lost in revery

Poor Joe she sighed at last Poor foolish Joe I wonder what has
become of him



CHAPTER IV

ETHEL MAKES PREPARATION

The Wegg homestead stood near the edge of a thin forest of pines through
which Little Bill Creek wound noisily on its way to the lake At the
left was a slope on which grew a neglected orchard of apple and pear
trees their trunks rough and gnarled by the struggle to outlive many
severe winters There was a rude rocky lane in front separated from
the yard by a fence of split pine rails but the ground surrounding the
house was rich enough to grow a profusion of June grass

The farm was of very little value Back of the yard was a fairly good
berry patch but aside from that some two acres of corn and a small
strip of timothy represented all that was fertile of the sixty acres the
place contained

But the house itself was the most imposing dwelling for many miles
around Just why that silent old seadog Jonas Wegg had come into this
secluded wilderness to locate was a problem the Millville people had
never yet solved Certainly it was with no idea of successfully farming
the land he had acquired for half of it was stony and half covered by
pine forest But the house he constructed was the wonder of the
countryside in its day It was a big twostory building the lower
half being jest cobblestones as the neighbors sneeringly remarked
while the upper half was decent pine lumber The lower floor of this
main building consisted of a single room with a great cobblestone
fireplace in the center of the rear wall and narrow prisonlike windows
at the front and sides There was a small porch in front with a great
entrance door of carved dark wood of a foreign look which the Captain
had brought from some port in Massachusetts A stair in one corner of
the big living room led to the second story where four large
bedchambers were arranged These had once been plastered and papered
but the wallpaper had all faded into dull neutral tints and in one of
the rooms a big patch of plaster had fallen away from the ceiling
showing the bare lath Only one of the upstairs rooms had ever been
furnished and it now contained a corded wooden bedstead a cheap pine
table and one brokenlegged chair Indeed the main building which I
have briefly described had not been in use for many years Sometimes
when Captain Wegg was alive he would build a log fire in the great
fireplace on a winters evening and sit before it in silent mood until
far into the night And once when his young wife had first occupied the
new house the big room had acquired a fairly cosy and comfortable
appearance But it had always been sparsely furnished and most of the
decadent furniture that now littered it was useless and unlovely

The big wooden leanto at the back and the right wing were at this
time the only really habitable parts of the mansion The leanto had an
entrance from the living room but Old Hucks and Nora his wife used the
back door entirely It consisted of a large and cheerful kitchen and two
rooms off it one used as a store room and the other as a sleeping
chamber for the aged couple

The right wing was also constructed of cobblestone and had formerly
been Captain Weggs own chamber After his death his only child Joe
then a boy of sixteen had taken possession of his fathers room but
after a day or two he had suddenly quitted the house where he was born
and plunged into the great outside worldto seek his fortune it was
said Decidedly there was no future for the boy here in the cities
lurks opportunity

When Ethel Thompson arrived in the early morning that followed her
interview with McNutt she rode her pony through the gap in the rail
fence across the June grass and around to the back door On a bench
beside the pump an old woman sat shelling peas Her form was thin but
erect and her hair snowy white She moved with alertness and as the
girl dismounted and approached her she raised her head and turned a
pleasant face with deepset sightless gray eyes upon her visitor

Good morning Ethel dear she said I knew the ponys whinney
Youre up early today

Good morning Nora responded the schoolteacher advancing to kiss the
withered cheek Are you pretty well

In body dear In mind both Tom n mes pretty bad I spose we
couldnt a spected to stay here in peace forever but the blows come
suddinlike an it hurts us

Where is Tom

In the barn lookin over all the wonerful things the rich nabob has
sent here He says most things has strips o wood nailed over em but
some hasnt an Tom looks em over keerful an then tells me bout em
Hes gone to take another look at a wonerful new cookstove sos he
kin describe it to me right pertickler

Is he worried Nora

Wes both worried Ethel Our times come an no mistake Peggy McNutt
says as he had real orders to turn Hucks out if he was a married man
an theres no disclaimin hes married is there Peggys a kind man
an tol us to keep stayin til the nabobs arrove Then I guess well
git our walkinpapers mighty quick

Im not sure of that said the girl thoughtfully They must be
hardhearted indeed to turn you out into the world and you are both
capable people and would serve the city folks faithfully and well

Its my eyes replied the other in a simple matteroffact tone
Hucks might wait on the nabobs all right but they wont tolrate a
blind woman a minute Im sure An Hucks d ruther be with me in the
poorhouse than to let me go alone

Right y air Nora girl cried a merry voice and as the blind woman
looked up with a smile Ethel turned around to face Old Hucks

A tall man but much bent at the shoulders and limping in one leg from
an old hurt aggravated by rheumatism His form was as gnarled as the
treetrunks in the appleorchard and twisted almost as fantastically
But the head uplifted from the stooped shoulders and held a little to
one side was remarkable enough to attract attention It had scanty
white locks and a fringe of white whiskers under the chin and these
framed a smiling face and features that were extremely winning in
expression No one could remember ever seeing Old Hucks when he was not
smiling and the expression was neither set nor inane but so cheery and
bright that you were tempted to smile with him without knowing why For
dress he wore a much patched pair of woolen trousers and a hickory
shirt of faded blue with rough top boots and a dilapidated straw hat
that looked as if it might have outlived several generations

As Ethel greeted the man she looked him over carefully and sighed at the
result for certainly as far as personal appearances went he seemed as
unlikely a person to serve a nabob as could well be imagined But the
girl knew Thomas good points and remembering them took courage

If the worst comes she said brightly you are both to come to us to
live Ive arranged all that with grandmother you know But Im not
much afraid of your being obliged to leave here From all accounts this
Mr Merrick is a generous and freehearted man and Ive discovered that
strangers are not likely to be fearsome when you come to know them The
unknown always makes us childishly nervous you see and then we forget
its wrong to borrow trouble

Trues gospil said Old Hucks To know my Nora is to love her
Evbody loves Nora An the good Lord Hes tookn care o us so long it
seems like a sort o sacrelidge to feel that all thet pretty furnture
in the barn spells ony poorhouse to us Eh Ethel

McNutt arrived just then with big Ned Long Lon Taft the carpenter and
Widow Clark that lady having agreed to help with the cleanin She
didnt usually work out but was impelled to this task as much through
curiosity to see the new furniture as from desire to secure the wages

At once the crowd invaded the living room and after a glance around
Ethel ordered every bit of the furniture with the exception of two
antique but comfortable horsehair sofas carried away to the barn and
stored in the loft It did not take long to clear the big room and then
the Widow Clark swept out and began to scrub the floor and woodwork
while schoolteacher took her men into the right wing and made another
clearing of its traps

This room interested the girl very much In it Joe was born and frail
Mrs Wegg and her silent husband had both passed away It had two broad
French windows with sash doors opening on to a little porch of its own
which was covered thickly with honeysuckle vines A cupboard was built
into a niche of the thick cobblestone wall but it was locked and the
key was missing

Upstairs the girl had the rubbish removed for the first time in a
generation The corded bedstead in the north room was sent to join its
fellows in the barn loft and Ned Long swept everything clean in
readiness for the scrubbers

Then while Widow Clark and Nora cleaned industriouslyfor the blind
woman insisted on helping and did almost as much work as her
companionthe men folks proceeded to the barn and under the
schoolteachers directions uncrated the new furniture and opened the
bales of rugs and matting Lon Taft was building new steps to the front
porch but Old Hucks and Ned and McNutt reverently unpacked the truck
and set each piece carefully aside How they marveled at the enameled
beds and colored wicker furniture the easy chairs for lounging the
dainty dressers and all the innumerable pretty things discovered in
boxes bales and barrels you may well imagine Even Ethel was amazed
and delighted at the thoughtfulness of the dealer in including
everything that might be useful or ornamental in a summer home

The next few days were indeed busy ones for the girl entered
enthusiastically upon her task to transform the old house and with the
material John Merrick had so amply provided she succeeded admirably The
little maid was country bred but having seen glimpses of city life and
possessing much native good taste she arranged the rooms so charmingly
that they would admit of scant improvement The big living room must
serve as a dining room as well as parlor but so spacious was it that
such an arrangement proved easy No especial furniture for the living
room had been provided but by stealing a few chairs and odd pieces from
the ample supply provided for the bedrooms adding the two quaint sofas
and the upright piano and spreading the rugs in an artistic fashion
Ethel managed to make the parlor part of the room appear very cosy
The dining corner had a round table and highbacked chairs finished in
weathered oak and when all was in order the effect was not
inharmonious Some inspiration had induced Mr Merrick to send down a
batch of eighteen framed pictures procured at a bargain but from a
reliable dealer He thought they might help out and Ethel knew they
would for the walls of the old house were quite bare of ornament She
made them go as far as possible and Old Hucks by this time thoroughly
bewildered hung them where she dictated and made laughable attempts to
describe the subjects to blind Nora

A telegram telephoned over from the junction announced the proposed
arrival of the party on Thursday morning and the schoolteacher was
sure that everything would be in readiness at that time The paint on
Lons repairs would be dry the grass in the front yard was closely
cropped and the little bed of flowers between the corncrib and the
woodshed was blooming finely The cow was in the stable the pigs in
the shed and the Plymouth Rocks strutted over the yard with an absurd
assumption of pride

Wednesday Ethel took Old Hucks over to Millville and bought for him from
Sam Cotting a new suit of dark gray store clothes together with
shirts shoes and underwear She made McNutt pay the bill with John
Merricks money agreeing to explain the case to the nabob herself
and back up the agent in the unauthorized expenditure Nora had a new
gingham dress too which the girl had herself provided and on Thursday
morning Ethel was at the Wegg farm bright and early to see the old
couple properly attired to receive their new master She also put a last
touch to the pretty furniture and placed vases of her own roses and
sweet peas here and there to render the place homelike and to welcome
the expected arrivals

If they dont like it said the girl smiling theyre rather hard to
please

Theyre sure to like it dear answered old Nora touching with
sensitive fingers the flowers the books and the opened piano If they
dont theyre heretics an sinners an theres no good in em
whatever

Then the little schoolteacher bade goodbye to Hucks and his wife told
them to keep brave hearts and rode her pony crosslots to
Thompsons Crossing



CHAPTER V

THE ARRIVAL OF THE NABOBS

Well said Uncle John looking out of the car window were nearly
there

He didnt look the millionaire or nabob or anything else but a modest
little man full of joy at getting into the country His clothing was not
distinctive of wealth his hands were hard and roughened by years of
toil and his necktie had a plebeian trick of sliding under his left
ear Uncle John was just a plain simple goodhearted fellow before he
acquired riches and the possession of millions had in no way altered
his nature

The three nieces and himself were the only passengers in the coach
aside from rosycheeked Mary Patricias cook Finding that the road did
not run a sleeper to Chazy Junction Mr Merrick had ordered one
attached to the train for his especial use but he did not allow even
Patsy to suspect this extravagance

It seems to me observed Beth as she peered out while the train
puffed up the steep grade as if wed arrived at the heart of a
wilderness where farms are likely to be as scarce as Egyptian temples

The truth is replied her uncle with a cheerful smile that none of
us has an idea where were going or what that farm of mine looks like
Were explorers like Stanley in midAfrica Thats the beauty of this
excursion

Im glad I didnt bring any party dresses said dainty Louise shaking
her blonde head with a doubting expression toward the rock
covered hills

Why you might need them for hayrides remarked Patsy with a laugh
that is if any hay grows in this land of quarries

The train stopped with a jerk started with another jerk and stopped
again with a third that made them catch their breaths and hold fast to
the seats

Chazy Junction seh said the colored porter entering in haste to
seize their bags

They alighted on a small wooden platform and their hand baggage was
deposited beside them Their trunks were being tumbled off a car
far ahead

Then the whistle screamed the train gave a jerk and proceeded on its
way and Uncle John his nieces and their maid found themselves
confronting a solitary man in shirtsleeves who yawned languidly thrust
his hands in his pockets and stared at the strangers unmoved

It was six oclock The July sun was set in a clear sky but the air was
cool and pleasant Uncle John glanced around with the eye of a practiced
traveler Back of the station was a huddle of frame buildings set in a
hollow The stationtender was the only person in sight

Isnt there a carriage to meet us asked Louise in a slightly frigid
tone

Seems not replied her uncle Then he addressed the native Can you
tell us sir where Millville is he asked

Sevn mile up the road

Thank you kindly Is there any carriage to be had

The man smiled sardonically

Kerridges he said dont grow in these parts I take it you be the
party fer the Wegg farm

Youre right said Mr Merrick Im glad we are getting acquainted
Folks all well

Pretty fair

Now sir we want some breakfast to begin with and then some way to
get to my farm

Peggy orter a looked after you remarked the man eyeing the dainty
gowns of the young ladies reflectively

Whos Peggy

Thats McNutt the man you hired to do things

Ah yes he surely ought to have sent some sort of a team to meet us
agreed Uncle John Whats that group of houses yonder

Thets the Junction

Any hotel

Sure

And a livery stable

Course there is

Then well get along said Uncle John assuming a sudden brisk manner
Just keep your eye on our baggage till we get back my good fellow
There are no people to interfere with it but some bears or tigers might
come out of the hills and eat it up Now girls away we go

Uncle Johns nieces were not so greatly dismayed at this experience as
might have been expected They had recently accompanied their erratic
relative on a European trip and had learned to be patient under
difficulties

A quarter of a mile down the dusty road they came to the hotel a
dismal unclean looking place that smelled of stale beer Uncle John
routed out the proprietor

Folks up he inquired

Long ago said the man

Get us some boiled eggs bread and butter and plenty of fresh
milkright away ordered Mr Merrick The quicker it comes the more
Ill pay you Bring a table out here on the porch and well eat in the
open air Wheres the livery stableeh Oh I see Now step lively my
man and your fortunes made Ill add a quarter of a dollar for every
five minutes you save us in time

The fellow stared then woke up with a start and disappeared within

By gum Ill bet a hen its thet air nabob he muttered

Leaving his girls and Mary to sit on the wooden benches of the porch
Uncle John crossed the road to the livery stable where he discovered a
man and a boy engaged in cleaning the half dozen sorry looking nags the
establishment contained A threeseated democrat wagon was engaged to
carry the party to the Wegg farm at Millville and a rickety lumber
wagon would take the baggage The liveryman recognized his customer as
soon as the Wegg farm was mentioned and determined to do the city guy
up brown

Roads bad an up hill an my times vallyble he said in a surly
voice Ill hev to charge ye three dollars

For what asked Uncle John quietly

Fer the two teams to Millville

Get them harnessed right away load up the baggage and have the
democrat at the hotel in twenty minutes Heres five dollars and if
youll look pleasant you may keep the change

Blame my thick skull muttered the liveryman as he watched the
little man depart What a cussed fool I were not to say four dollars
instead o three

But he called to his boy to hurry up and in the stipulated time the
teams were ready

Uncle John and his nieces were just finishing their eggs which were
fresh and delicious The milk was also a revelation Through the windows
of the hotel several frowsy looking women and an open mouthed boy were
staring hard at the unconscious city folk

Even Louise was in a mood for laughter as they mounted to the high seats
of the democrat The glorious air the clear sunshine and a satisfactory
if simple breakfast had put them all in a good humor with the world

They stopped at the station for their hand baggage and saw that the
trunks were properly loaded on the lumber wagon Then slowly they
started to mount the long hill that began its incline just across
the tracks

Sure this is the way inquired Uncle John perched beside the driver

I were horned here answered the man conclusively

That seems to settle it Pretty big hill that one ahead of us

Its the Little Bill When we cross it were at Millville

Seven miles of desolate country could not dampen the spirits of the
girls Secretly each one was confident that Uncle Johns unknown farm
would prove to be impossible and that in a day or so at the latest they
would retrace their steps But in the meantime the adventure was novel
and interesting and they were prepared to accept the inevitable with
all graciousness

When after the long climb up the hill they saw the quaint mill and the
town lying just across rushing Little Bill Creek when from their
elevation they beheld the placid lake half hidden by its stately pines
and gazed up the rugged and picturesque foothills to the great
mountains beyond then indeed they drew in deep breaths and began as
Patsy exclaimed to be glad they came

That Millville asked Uncle John eagerly

Yes sir

And which of those houses belongs to the Wegg farm

Ye cant see the Wegg house from here the pines hide it said the
man urging his horses into a trot as they approached the bridge

Pretty good farm inquired Uncle John hopefully

Worst in the county was the disconcerting reply Half rocks an half
trees Ol Capn Wegg wasnt no farmer He were a seacapn so its no
wonder he got took in when he bought the place

Uncle John sighed

Ive just bought it myself he observed

Theres a ol addige said the man grinning bout a fool an his
money The house is a hunker but wats the use of a house without
a farm

What is a hunker please inquired Louise curiously

The liveryman ventured no reply perhaps because he was guiding his
horses over the rickety bridge

Want to stop at the village he asked

No drive on to the farm

The scene was so rude and at the same time so picturesque that it
impressed them all very agreeably Perhaps they were the more delighted
because they had expected nothing admirable in this all but forsaken
spot They did not notice the people who stared after them as they
rattled through the village or they would have seen Uncle Johns
agent in front of his office his round eyes fairly bulging from
his head

It had never occurred to McNutt to be at the Junction to welcome his
patron He had followed his instructions and set Mr Merricks house in
order and there he considered that his duty ended He would of course
call on the nabob presently and render an account of the money he
had received

Sam Cotting the storekeeper gazed after the livery team with a sour
countenance he resented the fact that five bigboxes of groceries had
been forwarded from the city to the Wegg farm Whatn thunders the use
havin city folks here ef they dont buy nothin he asked the boys
and they agreed it was no use at all

Proceeding at a smart trot the horses came to the Pearson farm where
they turned into the Jane at the left and straightway subsided to a slow
walk the wheels bumping and jolting over the stony way

Whats this exclaimed Uncle John who had narrowly escaped biting his
tongue through and through Why did you turn down here

Its the road returned the driver with a chuckle its the
cobblestone lane to yer farm an the farms bout the same sort o
land as the lane

For a few moments the passengers maintained a dismal silence

The countrys lovely said Patsy glancing at the panorama as they
mounted a slight elevation

Are you sure Uncle that there is a house or any place of refuge on
your farm asked Louise in a mischievous tone

Why theres a rumor of a house and the rumor says its a hunker
replied Mr Merrick in a voice that betrayed a slight uneasiness

Doubtless the house matches the farm said Beth calmly I imagine it
has two rooms and a leaky roof But never mind girls This has been a
pleasant trip and we can seek shelter elsewhere if the worst comes to
the worst

I guess the worst has come aready observed the driver for the
house is by odds the best part o the Wegg farm Its big enough fer a
hotel an cost a lot o money in its day Seems like the lunatics all
crowd to thet placefust ol Capn Wegg wasted of his substance on it
an now

He paused perhaps fearing he might become personal in his remarks and
Uncle John coughed while the girls shrieked with laughter

Expecting nothing they were amazed when they passed the orchard and the
group of pines that had concealed the house and suddenly drew up beside
the oldfashioned stile built into the rail fence Every eye was
instantly upon the quaint roomy mansion the grassy sward extending
between it and the road and the cosy and homelike setting of the
outbuildings

Heres Weggs said the liveryman

Oh Uncle cried Beth how lovely

Louises pretty face was wreathed with smiles Patsy drew in a long
breath and scrambled out of the high seat

On the corner of the front porch stood Nora arrayed in her neat gray
gown and a cap Her face was composed but she felt herself trembling
a little

Old Hucks came slowly down the steps to greet the company Never in his
memory had his dress been so immaculate The queer old fellow seemed to
appreciate this as he raised his smiling face from the stooped shoulders
and poised it on one side like a sparrow

Welcome home sir he said to Uncle John Im Hucks sir Thomas
Hucks and without more words he proceeded to remove the satchels from
the wagon

Ah yes returned Mr Merrick cheered by the welcome and the smile of
the old man Id forgotten about you but Im glad youre here

And that is my wife Nora on the porch Shes the housekeeper sir
And then lowering his voice so that only the girls and Uncle John could
hear he added simply Shes blind

Patsy walked straight up to the eager pathetic figure of the woman and
took her hand in a warm clasp

Im Patricia Nora she said and Im sure we shall be friends

Beth followed her cousins lead

And I am Beth Nora Will you remember me

Surely miss by your voice returned the old woman beaming
delightedly at these evidences of kindliness

Here is another Nora said their cousin in gentle tones I am
Louise

Three young and pretty girls Nora and as good as they are pretty
announced Uncle John proudly Will you show us in Thomas or will
your wife

Nora will take the young ladies to their rooms sir

Not now Uncle they all protested in nearly identical words and
Louise added Let us drink in the delights of this pretty picture
before we shut ourselves up in the stuffy rooms I hope theyve
been aired

Patsy ran to a chickencoop on the side lawn where a fussy hen was
calling to her children that strangers had arrived Beth exclaimed at
the honeysuckle vines and Louise sank into a rustic chair with a sigh
of content

Im so glad you brought us here Uncle she said What a surprise it
is to find the place so pretty

They could hear the rush of the Little Bill in the wood behind them and
a soft breeze stirred the pines and wafted their fragrance to the
nostrils of the new arrivals Uncle John squatted on the shady steps and
fairly beamed upon the rustic scene spread out before him Patsy had now
thrown aside her hat and jacket and lay outstretched upon the cool
grass while the chickens eyed her with evident suspicion Beth was
picking a bouquet of honeysuckles just because they were so sweet
and homely

Im almost sure I sent some hammocks and a croquet set remarked Uncle
John

Theyre here sir said Old Hucks who had watched each one with his
persistent smile and now stood awaiting his new masters commands But
we didnt know jest where ye wanted em put

Mary came out She had taken off her things and donned her white apron

The house is quite wonderful Mr Merrick she said There is
everything we can possibly need and all as neat as wax

The report stirred the girls to explore They all trooped into the big
living room and were at once captivated by its charm Nora led them
upstairs to their chambers finding the way as unerringly as if she
possessed perfect vision and here a new chorus of delight was evoked

The blue room is mine cried Louise

Mine is the pink room said Beth

And I choose the white room declared Patsy The Majors is just
next and it will please him because it is all green and gold But where
will Uncle John room

The master will use the right wing said old Nora who had listened
with real pleasure to the exclamations of delight It were Capn Weggs
room ye know an weve fitted it all new

Indeed Uncle John was at that moment inspecting his apartment and he
sighed contentedly as he congratulated himself upon his foresight in
sending down the furnishings on the chance of their being needed They
had effected a complete transformation of the old house

But who had arranged everything Surely the perfect taste and dainty
touch evidenced everywhere was not to be attributed to blind Nora The
little man was thoughtful as he turned to Old Hucks

Who did it Thomas he asked

Miss Ethel sir the schoolmaam

Oh A city girl

No sir Crazy Will Thompsons granddaughter She lives bout nine mile
away

Is she here now

Went home this mornin sir It were a great pleasure to her she said
an she hoped as how youd like everything an be happy here

Undo John nodded

We must call on that girl he remarked We owe her a good deal I
imagine and shes entitled to our grateful thanks



CHAPTER VI

PEGGY PRESENTS HIS BILL

Millville waited in agonized suspense for three days for tangible
evidence that the nabob was in their midst as Nib Corkins poetically
expressed it but the city folks seemed glued to the farm and no one of
them had yet appeared in the village As a matter of fact Patsy and
Uncle John were enthusiastically fishing in the Little Bill far up in
the pine woods and having the time of their lives in spite of their
scant success in capturing trout Old Hucks could go out before
breakfast and bring in an ample supply of speckled beauties for Mary to
fry but Uncle Johns splendid outfit seemed scorned by the finny folk
and after getting her dress torn in sundry places and a hook in the
fleshy part of her arm Patsy learned to seek shelter behind a tree
whenever her uncle cast his fly But they reveled in the woods and
would lie on the bank for hours listening to the murmur of the brook and
the songs of the birds

The temper of the other two girls was different Beth De Graf had
brought along an archery outfit and she set up her target on the ample
green the day following her arrival Here she practiced persistently
shooting at sixty yards with much skill But occasionally when Louise
tired of her novel and her cushions in the hammock the two girls would
play tennis or croquet togetherBeth invariably winning

Such delightful laziness could brook no interference for the first days
of their arrival and it was not until Peggy McNutt ventured over on
Monday morning for a settlement with Mr Merrick that any from the
little world around them dared intrude upon the dwellers at the
Wegg farm

Although the agent had been late in starting from Millville and Nick
Thornes sorrel mare had walked every step of the way Peggy was obliged
to wait in the yard a good half hour for the nabob to finish his
breakfast During that time he tried to decide which of the two
statements of accounts that he had prepared he was most justified in
presenting He had learned from the liveryman at the Junction that Mr
Merrick had paid five dollars for a trip that was usually made for two
and also that the extravagant man had paid seventyfive cents more to
Lucky Todd the hotel keeper than his bill came to The knowledge of
such reckless expenditures had fortified little McNutt in marking up
the account of the money he had received and instead of charging two
dollars a day for his own services as he had at first intended he put
them down at three dollars a dayand made the days stretch as much as
possible Also he charged a round commission on the wages of Lon Taft
and Ned Long and doubled the liverymans bill for hauling the goods
over from the Junction Ethel Thompson had refused to accept any payment
for what she had done but Peggy bravely charged it up at good round
figures When the bill was made out and figured up it left him a
magnificent surplus for his private account but at the last his heart
failed him and he made out another bill more modest in its extortions
He had brought them both along though one in each pocket vacillating
between them as he thought first of the Merrick millions and then of the
righteous anger he might incur By the time Uncle John came out to him
smiling and cordial he had not thoroughly made up his mind which
account to present

I must thank you for carrying out my orders so intelligently began
the millionaire Without your assistance I might have found things in
bad shape I fear

McNutt was reassured The nabob would stand for bill No  without a
doubt

I tried fer to do my best sir he said

And you did very well was the reply I hope you kept your
expenditures well within bounds

The agents heart sank at the question and the shrewd alert look that
accompanied it Even millionaires do not allow themselves to be
swindled if they can help it Bill No  would be stiff enough he
might even have to knock a few dollars off from that

Most things is high in Millville he faltered an wages has gone up
jest terrble The boys dont seem to wanter do nuthin without
big pay

That is the case everywhere responded Mr Merrick thoughtfully and
between us McNutt Im glad wages are better in these prosperous times
The man who works by the day should be well paid for he has to pay well
for his living Adequately paid labor is the foundation of all
prosperity

Peggy smiled cheerfully He was glad he had had the forethought to bring
Bill No  along with him

Hosses is high too he remarked complacently an lumber an nails
is up As fer the livestock I bought fer ye I found I had to pay like
sixty for it

I suppose they overcharged you because a city man wanted the animals
But of course you would not allow me to be robbed

Oh course not Mr Merrick

And that nag in the stable is a sorry old beast

Peggy was in despair Why in the world hadnt he charged for the
beast As it was now too late to add it to the bill he replied
grudgingly

The hoss you mention belongs to the place sir It went with the farm
long o Old Hucks an Nora

Im glad you reminded me of those people said Uncle John seriously
Tell me their history

Louise sauntered from the house at this juncture and sank gracefully
upon the grass at her uncles feet She carried a book but did not
open it

Aint much to tell sir bout them folks replied the agent Capn
Wegg brung the Huckses with him when he settled here Wegg were a
seacapn ye see an when he retired he Wanted to git as far from the
seas he could

That was strange A sailor usually loves to be near salt water all his
days observed Uncle John

Wall Wegg he were diffrent He come here when I were a boy bringin
a sadfaced young woman an Ol Hucks an Nora I spose Hucks were a
sailor too though he never says nuthin bout that The Capn bought
this nocount farm an had this house built on ita proceedin that ef
I do say it struck evrybody as curous

It was curious agreed Mr Merrick

But the curousest thing was thet he didnt make no tempt at farmin
Folks said he had money to burn fer he loaded it into this fool house
an then sot down an smoked all day an looked glum Ol Hucks planted
the berry patch an looked arter the orchard an the stock but Capn
Wegg ony smoked an sulked People at Millville was glad to leave him
alone an the ony friend he ever had were crazy Will Thompson

Crazy

As a loon The agent hitched uneasily on the lawn bench where he was
seated and then continued hastily But thet aint neither here ner
there A baby was born arter a time an while he was young the
sadfaced mother sickened an died Capn Wegg give her a decent funral
an went right on smokin his pipe an sulkin same as ever Then
hehedied rather lamely an Joethets the boybein then about
sixteen dug out n run away We haint seen him sense

Nice boy asked Uncle John

Joe were pretty well liked here though he had a bit o his dads
sulkiness He n Ethel Thompsoncrazy Wills grandaughterseemed
like to make up together but even she dont know what drav him
offnless it were the Capns suddint deathner where he went to

Uncle John seemed thoughtful but asked no more questions and McNutt
appeared to be relieved that he refrained But the bill ought to be
forthcoming now and the agent gave a guilty start as his
patron remarked

I want to settle with you for what you have done Im willing to pay a
liberal price you understand but I wont submit to being robbed
outrageously by you or any of your Millville people

This was said so sternly that it sent McNutt into an ague of terror He
fumbled for the smallest bill tremblingly placed it in Mr Merricks
hand and then with a thrill of despair realized he had presented the
dreadful No 

Itsitsacount of what I spent out he stammered

Uncle John ran his eye over the bill

What are Plymouth Rocks he demanded

Hehens sir

Hens at a dollar apiece

Thoroughbreds sir Extry fine stock I raised em myself

Hm Youve charged them twice

Eh

Heres an item Twelve Plymouth Rocks twelve dollars and farther
down Twelve Plymouth Rocks eighteen dollars

Oh yes o course Ye see I sold you a dozen first of the dollar
kind Then I thought as how bein fine young birds youd be tempted
fer to eat em an a dozen dont go fur on the table So I up an sold
ye another dozen extry ol stock an remarkable highbred fer a
dollaranahalf each Which is dirt cheap because theys too old to
eat an jest right fer layers

Are they here

Every one of em

Very good Im glad to have them The cow seems reasonably priced for
a Jersey

It is Jest extrornary exclaimed Peggy reassured

And your people have all done work of an unusual character in a
painstaking manner I am very much pleased There seems to be a hundred
and forty dollars my due remaining from the five hundred I sent you

Here it is sir responded McNutt taking the money from his
pocketbook In another place he had more money which he had intended
to pay if the smaller bill had been presented

Uncle John took the money

You are an honest fellow McNutt said he I hadnt expected a dollar
back for folks usually take advantage of a stranger if he gives them
half a chance So I thank you for your honesty as well as for your
services Good morning

The agent was thoroughly ashamed of himself To be sech a duffer as to
return that money when by means of a little strategy he might have kept
it made him feel both humiliated and indignant A hundred and forty
dollars When would he have a chance to get such a windfall again Pah
he was a foolto copy his identical thoughts a gol dum
blithering idjit

All the way home he reflected dismally upon his lack of business
foresight and strove to plan ways to get money outn thet easy mark

Didnt the man rob you Uncle asked Louise when the agent had
disappeared

Yes dear but I wouldnt give him the satisfaction of knowing I
realized it

That was what I thought By the way that Wegg history seems both
romantic and unusual she said musingly Dont you scent some mystery
in what the man said of it

Mystery cried Uncle John Lordy no Louise Youve been readin too
many novels Romances dont grow in parts like these

But I think this is where they are most likely to grow Uncle
persisted the girl just consider A retired sea captain hides inland
with no companions but a grinning sailor and his blind housekeeper
except his pale wife of course and she is described as sad and
unhappy Who was she do you think

I dont think said Uncle John smiling and patting the fair check of
his niece And it dont matter who she was

Im sure it does It is the key to the whole mystery Even her baby
could not cheer the poor things broken heart Even the fine house the
Captain built failed to interest her She pined away and died and

And that finished the romance Louise

Oh no that added to its interest The boy grew up in this dismal
place and brooded on his mothers wrongs His stern sulky old father
died suddenly Was he murdered in a low voice did the son revenge
his mothers wrongs

Figglepiff Louise Youre getting theatricand so early in the
morning too Want to saddle my new farm with a murder do you Well
its rubbish Joe Wegg ran away from here to get busy in the world
Major Doyle helped him with my money in exchange for this farm which
the boy was sensible to get rid ofalthough Im glad its now mine The
Major liked Joe Wegg and says hes a cleancut fine young feller Hes
an inventor too even if an unlucky one and Ive no doubt hell make
his way in the world and become a good citizen

With these words Uncle John arose and sauntered around to the barn to
look at the litter of new pigs that just then served to interest and
amuse him The girl remained seated upon the grass her hands clasped
over her knee and a look of deep retrospection upon her face



CHAPTER VII

LOUISE SCENTS A MYSTERY

Louise Merrick was the eldest of Uncle Johns nieces having just passed
her eighteenth birthday In the city she was devoted to the requirements
of fashionable society andurged thereto by her worldlyminded
motherled a mere butterfly existence Her two cousins frankly agreed
that Louise was shallow insincere and inclined to be affected but of
the three girls she displayed the most equable and pleasant disposition
and under the most trying circumstances was composed and charming in
manner For this reason she was an agreeable companion and men usually
admired her graceful figure and her piquant pretty face with its crown
of fluffy blonde hair and winning expression There was a rumor that she
was engaged to be married to Arthur Weldon a young man of position in
the city but Uncle John ignored the possibility of losing one of his
cherished nieces and declared that Louise was still too young to think
of marriage

When away from her frivolous mother and the inconsequent home
environments the girl was more unaffected and natural in her ways and
her faults were doubtless more the result of education than of
natural tendency

One thing was indisputable however Louise Merrick was a clever girl
possessing a quick intellect and a keen insight into the character of
others Her apparent shallowness was a blind of the same character as
her assumed graciousness and while she would have been more lovable
without any pretence or sham she could not have been Louise Merrick and
allow others to read her as she actually was Patsy and Beth thought
they knew her and admired or liked rather than loved their cousin
Uncle John thought he knew her too and was very proud of his eldest
niece in spite of some discovered qualities that were not wholly
admirable

An extensive course of light literature not void of detective
stories had at this moment primed Louise with its influence to the
extent of inducing her to scent a mystery in the history of Captain
Wegg The plain folks around Millville might speculate listlessly upon
the queer doins at the farm and never get anywhere near the truth
Indeed the strange occurrences she had just heard were nearly forgotten
in the community and soon would be forgotten altogetherunless the
quick ear of a young girl had caught the clue so long ignored

At first she scarcely appreciated the importance of the undertaking It
occurred to her that an effort to read to the bottom of the sea
captains romance would be a charming diversion while she resided at
Millville and in undertaking the task she laughingly accused herself of
becoming an amateur detectivean occupation that promised to be
thrilling and delightful

Warned however by the rebuff she had met with from Uncle John the
girl decided not to confide either her suspicions or her proposed
investigation to anyone for the present but to keep her own counsel
until she could surprise them all with the denouement or required
assistance to complete her work

Inspired by the cleverness and fascination of this idea Louise set to
work to tabulate the information she had received thus far noting the
element of mystery each fact evolved First Captain Wegg must have been
a rich man in order to build this house maintain two servants and live
for years in comfort without any income from his barren farm lands What
became of his money after his death Why was his only son obliged to fly
to the cities in order to obtain a livelihood Secondly the Captain a
surly and silent man had brought hitherperhaps by forcea young
woman as his wife who was so unhappy that she pined away and died Who
was this woman What had rendered her so unhappy and despairing

Thirdly the Captains only friend had been a crazy man named Will
Thompson Was he crazy before the Captains death or had he become
crazed at that time some terrible tragedy unhinging his mind

Fourthly the granddaughter of Thompson Ethel and the son of Captain
Wegg had been in love with each other and people expected they would
marry in time But at his fathers sudden death the boy fled and left
his sweetheart without a word Whyunless something had occurred that
rendered their marriage impossible

In the fifth place there was Old Hucks and his blind wife to be
considered What did they know about their old masters secret history
What tragic memories lurked beneath the mans perpetual smile and the
womans composed and sightless face

Surely there was enough here to excite the curiosity and warrant an
effort to untangle the mystery And as instruments to the end there were
several people available who could be of use to her McNutt the agent
who evidently knew more than he had cared to tell Old Hucks and his
wife and Ethel Thompson the schoolteacher There might be others but
one or another of these four must know the truth and it would be her
pleasant duty to obtain a full disclosure So she was anxious to begin
her investigations at once

When her uncle returned from his visit to the pigs Louise said to him

Ive been thinking dear that we ought to call upon that young lady
who arranged our rooms and thank her for her kindness

Thats true he replied

Cant we drive over to Thompsons this morning Uncle

Beth and Patsy have planned a tramp to the lake and a row after
waterlilies

Then let us make our call together We can invite the girl to come here
and spend a day with us when Patsy and Beth will be able to meet her

Thats a good idea Louise I was wondering what Id do this morning
Tell Old Hucks to get the nag harnessed

The girl ran eagerly upon her errand Old Hucks seemed surprised and a
curious expression showed for an instant through his smile But he
turned without a word to harness the horse

Louise stood watching him

Your fingers are quite nimble Thomas considering the fact that you
were once a sailor she said

But sailors have to be nimble miss he returned buckling a strap
unmoved Who tol ye I were once a seafarin man

I guessed it

As he appeared indisposed to say more on the subject she asked Did you
sail with Captain Wegg

Partly miss Dans already now Dont jerk the bit fer his mouths
tender an it makes him balky Ef he balks jest let him rest a time an
then speak to him Dan aint vicious hes jest ornery

She climbed into the dilapidated old buggy and took the reins Dan
groaned and ambled slowly around to where Uncle John stood awaiting
his niece

Let me drive Uncle she said I understand Dan

Well I dont returned Uncle John in his whimsical way as he
mounted to the seat beside her I dont understand how hes happened to
live since the landing of Columbus or what hes good for or why
someone dont knock him on the head

Dan turned his long lean face as if to give the speaker a reproachful
look then he groaned again leaned forward and drew the buggy slowly
into the stony lane

Do you know where the Thompsons live inquired Uncle John

No Whoa Dan

That was the best thing the nag did He knew how to whoa

Thomas called Uncle John turning in his seat and at the summons Old
Hucks came from the barn and approached them How do you get to Miss
Thompsons place

Miss Ethels Another fleeting expression of surprise

Yes were going over to thank her for her kindness to us

IIm most sure as shell be here soon to call sir Andperhaps you
oughtnt toto go toThompsons stammered Hucks glancing up at them
with his bright elusive smile

Well were going anyhow growled Mr Merrick

Then turn left at the main road an keep straight ahead to Thompsons
Ye cant miss it sir Brick schoolhouse on the other corner

Thank you Thomas Drive on Louise



CHAPTER VIII

THE LITTLE SCHOOLMAAM

Dan balked only twice on the journey but even this moderate rebellion
so annoyed Uncle John that he declared he would walk back rather than
ride behind this mulish antiquity again

When they came to the Thompson dwelling it at first sight seemed
deserted A knock on the front door failed to produce any response

Perhaps theyre away from home suggested Louise

Theres a path around to the back said Uncle John Lets explore in
that direction

They made their way leisurely toward the rear and had almost passed the
house when a deep roar broke the stillness It was succeeded by
another and another like the bellowing of a mad bull and the
intruders stopped short and Louise clung to her uncle in sudden panic

Be still Will Stop I saystop

A sharp crack as of a lash accompanied the words and a moan or two
was followed by absolute silence

Uncle John and Louise looked at one another with startled eyes

He must be worse said the old gentleman mopping his forehead with a
handkerchief

With one accord they started softly to retrace their steps when a new
sound halted them again It was a clear fresh young voice singing a
plaintive ditty in a nonchalant careless tone

Thats Ethel Im sure exclaimed Louise grasping her uncles arm

Well what shall we do he demanded

Mrthe crazy man seems quiet now she whispered Let us find the
girl if we can

So again they traversed the path and this time came to the pretty garden
behind the house Ethel was tending a flower bed She wore her gingham
dress and a sunbonnet and kneeling in the path stretched out her slim
brown arm to uproot the weeds But the crunching of the gravel aroused
her attention and observing her visitors she sprang up and hastened
toward them

Louise introduced her uncle and herself in her most pleasant and
gracious way and the school teacher led them to a garden bench and
begged them to be seated

The day is lovely she said and I always find my garden more
cheerful than the house Grandfathers illness makes the house
unpleasant for strangers too

Louise was surprised at this frank reference and Uncle John coughed to
hide his embarrassment

II hope the invalid isis improving he said doubtful whether he
should say anything on the delicate subject or not

He is always the same sir was the quiet response I suppose they
have told you that grandfather is a madman Our great trouble is well
known in this neighborhood

He is not dangerous I suppose hazarded Uncle John remembering the
brutal bellowing

Oh not at all He is fully paralyzed from his waist down poor
grandfather and can do no harm to anyone But often his outbreaks are
unpleasant to listen to continued the girl deprecatingly as if
suddenly conscious that they had overheard the recent uproar

Has he beenthis wayfor long inquired Louise

His mind has been erratic and unbalanced since I can remember
answered Ethel calmly but he first became violent at the time Captain
Wegg died some three years ago Grandfather was very fond of the
Captain and happened to be with him at the time of his sudden death
The shock drove him mad

Was he paralyzed before that time asked Louise earnestly

No but the paralysis followed almost immediately The doctor says that
a blood vessel which burst in the brain is responsible for both
afflictions

The pause that followed was growing awkward when Uncle John said with
an evident effort to change the subject

This is a fine old homestead

It is indeed responded Ethel brightly and it enjoys the
distinction of being one of the first houses built in the foothills My
greatgrandfather was really the first settler in these parts and
originally located his cabin where the mill now stands Little Bill
Thompson he was called for he was a small wiry manvery different
from grandfather who in his prime was a powerful man of over six feet
Little Bill Hill and Little Bill Creek were named after this pioneer
greatgrandsire who was quite successful raising flocks of sheep on the
plateau Before he died he built this house preferring the location to
his first one

The garden is beautiful said Louise enthusiastically And do you
teach in the little brick schoolhouse across the way

Yes Grandfather built it years ago without dreaming I would ever
teach there Now the county supports the school and pays me my salary

How long have you taught

For two years It is necessary now that grandfather is disabled He
has a small income remaining however and with what I earn we get along
very nicely

It was very good of you to assist in getting our house ready for us
said Louise We might have found things in sorry condition but for your
kindness

Oh I enjoyed the work I assure you replied Ethel As it is my
vacation it was a real pleasure to me to have something to do But I
fear my arrangement of your pretty furniture was very ungraceful

We havent altered a single thing declared Louise You must have
found it a tedious task unpacking and getting everything in shape

Tom and Nora were good help because they are fond of me and seem to
understand my wishes and Peggy McNutt brought me some men to do the
lifting and rough work explained Ethel

Have you known Hucks and his wife long asked Uncle John

Since I can remember sir They came here many years ago with Captain
Wegg

And has Thomas always smiled Louise inquired

Always was the laughing reply Its an odd expressionisnt itto
dwell forever on a mans face But Tom is never angry or hurt or
excited by anything so there is no reason he should not smile At the
time of Captain Weggs death and poor grandfathers terrible affliction
Old Hucks kept right on smiling the same as ever and perhaps his
pleasant face helped to cheer us all

Louise drew a long breath

Then the smile is a mask she said and is assumed to conceal the
mans real feelings

I do not think so Ethel answered thoughtfully The smile is
habitual and dominates any other expression his features might be
capable of but that it is assumed I do not believe Thomas is a
simpleminded honesthearted old fellow and to face the world
smilingly is a part of his religion I am sure he has nothing to
conceal and his devotion to his blind wife is very beautiful

But Norahow long has she been blind

Perhaps all her life I cannot tell how long Yet it is wonderful how
perfectly she finds her way without the aid of sight Captain Wegg used
to say she was the best housekeeper he ever knew

Did not his wife keep house for him when she was alive

I do not remember her

They say she was most unhappy

Ethel dropped her eyes and did not reply

How about Capn Wegg asked Uncle John Did you like him You see
were mighty curious about the family because weve acquired their old
home and are bound to be interested in the people that used to
live there

That is natural remarked the little school teacher with a sigh
Captain Wegg was always kind to me but the neighbors as a rule thought
him moody and badtempered After a pause she added He was not as
kind to his son as to me But I think his life was an unhappy one and
we have no right to reprove his memory too severely for his faults

What made him unhappy asked Louise quickly

Ethel smiled into her eager face

No one has solved that problem they say The Captain was as silent as
he was morose

The detective instinct was alive in Louise She hazarded a startling
query

Who killed Captain Wegg she demanded suddenly

Another smile preceded the reply

A dreadful foe called heart disease But come let me show you my
garden There are no such roses as these for miles around

Louise was confident she had made progress Ethel had admitted several
things that lent countenance to the suspicions already aroused but
perhaps this simple country girl had never imagined the tragedy that had
been enacted at her very door

She cordially urged Ethel Thompson to spend a day with them at the farm
and Uncle John who was pleased with the modesty and frankness of the
fairhaired little school teacher earnestly seconded the invitation

Then he thought of going home and the thought reminded him of Dan

Do you know he inquired where I could buy a decent horse

The girl looked thoughtful a moment then glanced up with a bright
smile

Will you buy one off me she asked

Willingly my dear if youve an animal to sell

Itsits our Joe He was grandfathers favorite colt when his trouble
came upon him We have no use for him now for I always ride or drive my
pony And grandmother says hes eating his head off to no purpose so
wed like to sell him If you will come to the barn Ill introduce
you to him

Joe proved on inspection to be an excellent horse if appearances were
to be trusted and Ethel assured Mr Merrick that the steed was both
gentle and intelligent

Do you use that surrey inquired Uncle John pointing to a neat
vehicle that seemed to be nearly new

Very seldom sir Grandmother would like to sell it with the horse

Its exactly what I need declared Mr Merrick How much for Joe and
his harness and the surrey

Ill go and ask what grandmother wants

She returned after a few minutes stating a figure that made Uncle John
lift his brows with a comical expression

A hundred dollars Do you take me for a brigand little girl I know
what horses are worth for Ive bought plenty of em Your Joe seems
sound as a dollar and hes just in his prime A hundred and fifty is
dirt cheap for him and the surrey will be worth at least seventyfive
Put in the harness at twentyfive and Ill give you twofifty for the
outfit and not a cent more or less Eh

No indeed said Ethel We could not get more than a hundred dollars
from anyone else around here

Because your neighbors are countrymen and cant afford a proper
investment So when they buy at all they only give about half what a
thing is actually worth But Ill be honest with you The price I offer
is a good deal less than Id have to pay in the cityHutchinson would
charge me five hundred at leastand I need just what youve got to
sell What do you say Miss Ethel

The price is one hundred dollars Mr Merrick

I wont pay it Let me talk with your grandmother

She does not see anyone sir

Louise looked up sharply scenting another clue

Isnt she well dear she asked in smooth tones

She looks after grandfather and helps Aunt Lucy with the housework

Well come Louise well go home said Uncle John sadly Id hoped
to be able to drive this fine fellow back but Danll have to groan an
balk all the way to the farm

Ethel smiled

Better buy at my price Mr Merrick she suggested

Tell you what Ill do he said pausing Ill split the difference
Take two hundred and well call it a bargain

But I cannot do that sir

It will help pay you for the hard work of fixing up the house he
rejoined pleadingly Your bill wasnt half enough

My bill wonderingly

The one I paid McNutt for your services

I made no charge sir I could not accept anything for a bit of
assistance to a neighbor

Oh Then McNutt got it did he

Im awfully sorry Mr Merrick I told Peggy I would not accept
payment

Hm Never mind Were not going to quarrel little neighbor May I
hitch Joe to the surrey

If you like Ill help you

Uncle John led Joe from his stall and together they harnessed the horse
to the surrey The girl knew better than the man how to buckle the
straps properly while Louise stood by helplessly and watched the
performance

Then Uncle John went for old Dan whom he led rickety buggy and all
into the Thompson stable

Ill send Hucks over to get him although we might as well knock him in
the head he said as he unharnessed the ancient steed Now then
Louise hop in

Youll be sure to come over Thursday for the day Miss Thompson
asked Louise taking Joes reins from her uncles hands

Ill not forget such a delightful engagement be sure

Uncle John had his pocketbook out and now he wadded up some bills and
thrust them into the little school teachers hand

Drive ahead Louise he called Good morning my dear See you on
Thursday

As the vehicle rolled out of the yard and turned into the highway Ethel
unrolled the bills with trembling fingers

If he has dared she began but paused abruptly with a smile of
content

The rich man had given her exactly one hundred dollars



CHAPTER IX

THE LIVES OF THE SAINTS

On Wednesday afternoon McNutt drove the sadeyed sorrel mare over to the
Wegg farm again He had been racking his brain for a way to get more
money out of the nabob for the idea had become a veritable passion with
him and now occupied all his thoughts

That very morning an inspiration had come to him Among other
occupations he had at one time adopted that of a bookagent and by dint
of persistent energy had sold numerous copies of Radfords Lives of the
Saints to the surrounding farmers They had cost him ninety cents a
copy and he had sold them at three dollars each netting a fine profit
in return for his labor The books were printed upon cheap paper
fearfully illustrated with blurred cuts but the covers were bound in
bright red with gold lettering Through misunderstandings three of these
copies had come back to him the subscribers refusing to accept them
and so thorough had been his canvassing that there remained no other
available customers for the saintly works So Peggy had kept them on a
shelf in his office for several years and now when his eye chanced
to light upon them he gave a snort of triumph and pounced upon them
eagerly Mr Merrick was a newcomer Without doubt he could be induced
to buy a copy of Radfords Lives

An hour later McNutt was on his mission the three copies which had
been carefully dusted reclining on the buggy seat beside him Arrived
at the Wegg farm he drove up to the stile and alighted

Louise was reading in the hammock and merely glanced at the little man
who solemnly stumped around to the back door with the three red volumes
tucked underneath his arm He had brought them all along to make his
errand look like business

Wheres the nabob he asked blind Nora

Whats that Mr McNutt she inquired as if puzzled She knew his
voice as she did that of nearly everyone with whom she had ever been
brought in contact

Why the nabob the boss Mr Merrick

Oh Hes in the barn with Tom I guess

McNutt entered the barn Uncle John was seated upon an overturned pail
watching Old Hucks oil Joes harness The agent approached him with a
deferential bow

Sir said he youll scuse my comin agin so soon to be abotherin
but I hev here three copies of Radfords famis wucks on the Lives o the
Saints in a edishun dee looks

A what

A edishun dee looks which means extry fine Its a great book an
theys all outn print cept these three which I haint no doubt many
folks would be glad to give their weight in gold fer an some over

Stand out of the light McNutt

The agent shifted his position

Them books sir

Oh take em away

What

I dont read novels

McNutt scratched his head perplexed at the rebuff His dee looks
speech had usually resulted in a sale An idea flashed across his
brainperhaps evolved by the scratching

The young lady sir

Oh the girls are loaded with books growled the nabob

The agent became desperate

But the young lady in the hammick sir as I jest now left says to
tell ye she wants one o these books mighty bad an hopes youll buy it
for her eddificationing

Oh she does eh

Mighty bad sir

Uncle John watched Thomas polish a buckle

Is it a moral work he asked

Nuthin could be moraler sir All bout the lives o

How much is it

Comes pretty high sir Three dollars But its

Here Take your money and get out Youre interrupting me

Very sorry sir Much obleeged sir Wherell I leave the book

Throw it in the manger

McNutt selected a volume that had a broken corner and laid it carefully
on the edge of the oatbin Then he put his money in his pocket and
turned away

Mornn to ye Mr Merrick

Stop a bit said Uncle John suddenly

The agent stopped

I believe I paid you ten dollars for Miss Ethel Thompsons services Is
that correct

Yeyes Mr Merrick

McNutts heart was in his shoes and he looked guiltily at his accuser
the pale blue eyes bulging fearfully

Very well see that she gets it

Of course Mr Merrick

And at once You may go

McNutt stumped from the barn He felt that a dreadful catastrophe had
overtaken him Scarcely could he restrain the impulse to sob aloud Ten
dollarsTen dollars gone to the dogs as the result of his visit to the
nabob that morning To lose ten dollars in order to gain three was very
bad business policy McNutt reflected bitterly that he would have been
better off had he stayed at home He ought to have been contented with
what he had already made and the severe manner the nabob had used in
addressing him told the agent plainly that he need not expect further
pickings from this source

In the midst of his despair the comforting thought that Ethel would
surely refuse the money came to sustain him so he recovered somewhat
his former spirits As he turned the corner of the house he observed
Louise still reading in the hammock

In some ways McNutt was a genius He did not neglect opportunities

Heres my las chance at these idjits he muttered an Ill learn
thet nabob what it costs to make Marsh McNutt stand outn his light

Then he hastened over to the hammock

Scuse me miss said he in his most ingratiating voice Is yer
uncle round anywheres

Isnt he in the barn asked the girl looking up

Cant find him high ner low But he ordered a book of me tother
dayRadfords Lives o the Saintsan perhaps youll take it an pay
me the money sos I kin go home

Louise gazed at the man musingly He was one of the people she intended
to pump for information concerning the mystery of Captain Wegg and she
must be gracious to him in order to win his goodwill and induce him to
speak freely With this thought in mind she drew out her purse
and asked

How much were you to be paid for the book

Three dollars miss

Here is the money then Tell meyour name is McNutt isnt ithow
long have you lived in this place

All my life miss Thank e miss Good day to ye miss

He placed the book in the hammock beside her

Dont go please said the girl Id like you to tell me something
about Captain Wegg and of his poor wife who died and

Nuther time miss Ill be glad to Yell find me in my orfice any
time Jest now Im in the dumdest hurry ye ever knew Good day to ye
miss he repeated and stumped quickly to the buggy awaiting him Next
moment he had seized the reins and was urging the sorrel mare along the
stony lane at her best pace

Louise was both astonished and disappointed but after a little thought
she looked after the departing agent with a shrewd smile

Hes afraid to talk she murmured and that only confirms my
suspicions that he knows more than he cares to tell

Meantime McNutt was doing his best to get away from the premises before
the discovery was made that he had sold two Lives of the Saints to one
family That there might be future consequences to follow his deception
never occurred to him only the immediate necessity for escape
occupied his mind

Nor were his fears altogether groundless Turning his head from time to
time for a glance behind he had seen Mr Merrick come from the barn
with a red book in his hand and approach the hammock whereupon the
young lady arose and exhibited a second book Then they both dropped the
books and ran into the lane and began shouting for him to stopthe
mans voice sounding especially indignant and imperative

But McNutt chose to be deaf He did not look around again and was
congratulating himself that he would soon be out of earshot when a
sudden apparition ahead caused the mare to halt abruptly It also caused
the cold chills to run down the agents back Beth and Patsy had stepped
into the lane from a field being on their way home from their
daily walk

Theyre calling to you sir said Patsy to the agent Didnt you hear
them

IIm a little deaf miss stammered McNutt who recognized the young
ladies as Mr Merricks nieces

I think they wish you to go back remarked Beth thoughtfully watching
the frantic waves of Uncle Johns chubby arms and Louises energetic
beckonings They were too far off to be heard plainly but their actions
might surely be understood

McNutt with reluctance looked over his shoulder and a second shudder
went through him

I haint got time to go back he said as an inspiration came to him
but I guess you kin do jest as well This book here picking up the
last of the three from the seat I offered to sell yer uncle fer five
dollars but he wanted it fer four I aint no haggler you understan
so I jest driv away Now Mr Merrick has changed his mind an is willin
to give five fer it but there aint nuthin small about me Ef you
galsll jest give me the four dollars ye kin take the book to yer uncle
with my compliments an I wont hev t go back Im in a
dreaful hurry

Patsy laughed at the little mans excited manner

Fortunately I have some money with me she said but you may as well
take the five dollars for unless Uncle had been willing to pay it he
would not have called you back

I think so myself miss he rejoined taking the money and handing
her the volume

Uncle John and Louise glaring at the distant group saw the third red
book change hands and in answer to their renewed cries and gestures
Patsy waved the Lives of the Saints at them reassuringly and came on
at a brisk walk followed by Beth

McNutt slapped the sorrel with the ends of the reins so energetically
that the mare broke into a trot and before the girls had come within
speaking distance of their uncle the agent was well out of sight and
exulting in the possession of eleven dollars to pay for his mornings
work Even if Ethel accepted that ten he reflected he would still be a
dollar ahead But he was sure she would tell him to keep it and hed
jest like to see thet air nabob git a penny back agin

Meantime Uncle Johns wrath which was always an effervescent quality
with the little gentleman had changed to wonder when he saw his nieces
approaching with the third redandgold book Louise was leaning against
the rail fence and laughing hysterically and suddenly a merry smile
appeared and spread over her uncles round face as he said

Did you ever hear of such an audacious swindle in all your born days

What will you do Uncle asked the girl wiping the tears of merriment
from her eyes Have the man arrested

Of course not my dear Its worth the money just to learn what talents
the fellow possesses Tell me Patsy he continued as the other nieces
joined them what did you pay for your book

Five dollars Uncle He said

Never mind what he said my dear Its all right I wanted it to add to
my collection So far Ive got three Lives of the Saintsand Im
thankful theyre not cats or thered be nine lives for me to
accumulate



CHAPTER X

THE MYSTERY DEEPENS

Ethel Thompson came over the next day as she had promised and the
sweetfaced gentle schoolmistress won the hearts of Uncle Johns three
nieces without an effort She was the eldest of them all but her
retired country life had kept her fresh and natural and Ethel seemed no
more mature than the younger girls except in a certain gravity that
early responsibility had thrust upon her

Together the four laughing lighthearted maids wandered through the
pines where the little schoolmaam showed them many pretty nooks and
mossy banks that the others had not yet discovered By following an
unsuspected path they cut across the wooded hills to the waterfall
where Little Bill Creek made a plunge of twenty feet into a rocky basin
below In spite of the bubbles the water here showed clear as crystal
and the girls admiringly christened it the Champagne Cup They shed
their shoes and stockings and waded in the pool enjoying the sport with
shrieks of merry laughtermore because they were happy than that there
was anything to laugh at

Afterward they traced the stream down to a lovely glade a half mile
above Millville where Ethel informed them the annual Sundayschool
picnic was always held and then trailed across the rocky plateau to the
farm By the time they reached home their appetites were well sharpened
for Marys excellent luncheon and the afternoon was devoted to rest
under the shady pines that grew beside the house

It was now when they felt thoroughly acquainted and at ease in one
anothers society that the girls indulged in talks concerning events in
their past and Ethel was greatly interested in the nieces recital of
their recent trip abroad with Uncle John They also spoke frankly of
their old life together at Elmhurst where Aunt Jane who was Uncle
Johns sister had congregated her three nieces for the purpose of
choosing from among them one to inherit her vast estates It seemed no
source of regret to any of them that a boy Kenneth Forbes had finally
succeeded to Aunt Janes property and this may be explained by the fact
that Uncle John had at that interesting juncture appeared to take charge
of the nieces It was quite evident that the eccentric but kindly old
fellow had succeeded in making these three girls as happy as their
dispositions would allow them to be

After the most interesting phases of their personal history had been
discussed the nieces began perhaps unconsciously to draw from Ethel
her own story It was simple enough and derived its interest mainly
from the fact that it concerned their new friend Her parents had both
passed away while she was young and Ethel had always lived with her
fathers father big Will Thompson a man reputed very welltodo for
this section and an energetic farmer from his youth

Old Will had always been accused of being unsociable and considering
himself above the neighboring farmers and it was true that Bob West
the implement dealer was his only associate before Captain Wegg
arrived A casual acquaintance with the Millville people might easily
explain this

With the advent of the Weggs however a strong friendship seemed to
spring up between the retired sea captain and the bluff erratic old
farmer which lasted until the fatal day when one died and the other
became a paralytic and a maniac

We have always thought said Ethel that the shock of the Captains
death unsettled my grandfathers mind They had been sitting quietly in
Captain Weggs room one evening as they were accustomed to do when
there was a sudden fall and a cry Thomas ran in at once and found
grandfather raving over the Captains dead body The old seaman had
heart disease it seems and had often declared he would die suddenly
It was a great blow to us all but especially to Joe

Her voice softened at this last remark and Patsy exclaimed
impulsively

Tell us about Joe Wegg Did you like him

Yes said Ethel simply we were naturally thrown much together in
our childhood and became staunch friends Grandpa often took me with
him on his visits to the Weggs and sometimes but not often the
Captain would bring Joe to see us He was a quiet thoughtful boy much
like his mother I imagine but for some reason he had conceived an
intense dislike for his father and an open hatred for this part of the
country where he was born Aside from these morbid notions Joe was
healthyminded and frank and genuine Had he been educated in any other
atmosphere than the gloomy one of the Wegg household I am sure Joes
character would have been wholly admirable and I have never blamed the
boy much for his peculiarities Captain Wegg would not permit him to go
to school but himself attended to such instructions as Joe could
acquire at home and this was so meager and the boy so ambitious that I
think it was one cause of his discontent I remember when I was sent to
school at Troy that Joe sobbed for days because he could not have the
same advantages He used to tell me wonderful stories of what he would
accomplish if he could only get out into the world

When he implored his father to let him go away Captain Wegg used to
assure Joe that he would some day be rich and there was no need of his
preparing himself for either a business or a profession but that did
not satisfy Joes ambition as you may imagine And when the end came
scarcely a dollar of money could be found among the Captains
possessions and no other property than this farm so it is evident he
deceived his son for some selfish purpose

Joe was at last free and the only thing I reproach him for is going
away without a word to me or any of his friends I heard indirectly of
his working his way through a technical school for he was always crazy
about mechanics and then he went to New York and I lost all further
trace of him

What do you suppose became of Captain Weggs money asked Louise

Ive no idea It is a singular thing that most of my grandfathers
savings disappeared at the same time On account of his mental condition
he can never tell us what became of his little fortune but luckily the
returns from the farm which we rent on shares and my own salary as
teacher of the district school enable us to live quite comfortably
although we must be economical

Why its really a romance cried Patsy who had listened eagerly

There are many romances in real life added Beth in her
undemonstrative way

Louise said nothing but her heart was throbbing with excitement
engendered by the tale which so strongly corroborated the suspicions
she had begun to entertain When Ethel had gone home Louise still
deliberated upon this fascinating mystery and her resolve grew to force
some sort of an explanation from the smiling lips of Old Hucks For the
sole available witness of that fatal nights tragedy when one strong
man died and another was driven mad was Thomas Hucks The old servitor
was also in a position to know much of the causes leading up to the
catastrophe he having been the confidential retainer of Captain Wegg
for many years Hucks must speak but the girl was wise enough to
realize that he would not do so unless urged by coaxing or forced by
strategy There was doubtless good reason why the old man had remained
silent for three years Her plan was to win his confidence Interest him
in Joes welfare and then the truth must come out

The frankly related story of Ethel had supplied Louise with the motive
for the crime for that a crime had been committed she was now doubly
sure Captain Wegg had money old Will Thompson had money both were
welltodo men In a retired country district where there were no
banks it was reasonable to suppose they kept large sums of money on
hand and the knowledge of this fact had tempted some one to a dreadful
deed Captain Wegg had been killed and old Thompson perhaps injured by a
blow upon the head from which he had never recovered Any suspicion the
fair young detective may have entertained that Thompson himself had
killed his friend was eradicated by the fact that he had been robbed at
the same time

Louise had originally undertaken her investigation through curiosity and
a desire to amuse herself by unveiling the mystery Now she began to
reflect that she was an instrument of justice for a discovery of the
truth might restore a fortune to poor Joe Wegg now struggling with the
world and put sweet Ethel Thompson in a position where the necessity
for her to teach school would be abolished This thought added a strong
impulse to her determination to succeed

Sunday afternoon the girl took blind Nora for a long drive through the
country taking pains to explain to her all the points of interest they
came to and delighting the old woman with her bright chatter Louise
had been kind to Nora from the beginning and her soft sympathetic
voice had quite won the poor creatures heart

On the way home in the delightful summer twilight the girl dexterously
led the conversation toward Noras past history

Was Thomas a sailor when you married him she asked

Yes miss He were bosn on Capn Weggs schooner the Lively Kate
an I were livin with Miss Mary as come to be Mrs Wegg arterward

Oh I see And were you blind then Nora

No miss I went blind arter our great trouble come to us

Trouble Oh Im so sorry dear What was it

The old woman was silent for a time Then she said

Id better not mention it I guess Thomas likes to forgit an when I
gets cryin an nervous he knows Ive been thinkin bout the
old trouble

Louise was disappointed but changed the subject adroitly

And Miss Mary who was afterward Mrs Wegg Did you love her Nora

Indeed I did child

What was she like

She were gentle an sweet an the mos beautiful creetur in
allinin the place where we lived An her fambily was that proud an
aristocratic thet no one could tech em with a tenfoot pole

I see Did she love Captain Wegg

Natrally sense she married of him an fit all her fambily to do it
An the Capn were thet proud o her thet he thought the world lay in
her sweet eyes

Oh I had an idea he didnt treat her well remarked the girl
soberly

Thats wrong declared Nora promptly Arter the trouble comefer it
come to the Weggs as well as to Tom an methe Capn sort o lost heart
to see his Mary cry day arter day an never be comforted He were hard
hit himself ye see an that made it a gloomy house an no mistake

Do you mean after you moved here to the farm

Yes deary

I hear Captain Wegg was very fond of Ethels grandfather continued
Louise trying to find an opening to penetrate old Noras reserve

They was good friends always was the brief reply

Did they ever quarrel Nora

Never that I knows of

And what do you suppose became of their money asked the girl

I dont know child Air we gettin near home

We are quite near now I wish you would open your heart to me and
tell me about that great trouble Nora I might be able to comfort you
in some way

The blind woman shook her head

Theres no comfort but in forgettin she said an the way to forgit
aint to talk about it

The unsatisfactory result of this conversation did not discourage
Louise although she was sorry to meet with no better success Gradually
she was learning the inside history of the Weggs When she discovered
what that great trouble had been she would secure an important clue in
the mystery she was sure Nora might some time be induced to speak more
freely and it was possible she might get the desired information from
Old Hucks She would try anyway

A dozen theories might be constructed to account for this great
trouble The one that Louise finally favored was that Captain Wegg had
been guilty of some crime on the high seas in which his boatswain Old
Hucks was likewise implicated They were obliged to abandon the sea and
fly to some outoftheway corner inland where they could be safely
hidden and their whereabouts never discovered It was the knowledge of
this crime she conjectured that had ruined sweet Mrs Weggs life and
made her weep day after day until her guilty husband became surly and
silent and unsociable

Louise now began to cultivate Thomas but her progress was slow Patsy
seemed to be the old mans favorite and for some reason he became glum
and uncommunicative whenever Louise was around The girl suspected that
Nora had told her husband of the recent conversation in spite of her
assertion that she wished to avoid all reference to their great trouble



CHAPTER XI

THREE AMATEUR DETECTIVES

Puzzling her brain what to do next Louise suddenly decided to confide
her secret to her two cousins Not that she considered them capable of a
greater success than she could herself accomplish but they might prove
valuable assistants in the capacity of lieutenants She had great
respect for Beths calm judgment and keen intuitions and Patsy had a
way of accomplishing difficult things with ease

The two girls listened to Louise with expressions of mingled wonder and
amusement while she confided to them her first suspicions that Captain
Wegg had been murdered and then the bits of information she had
gathered to strengthen the surmise and assure her she was justified in
her efforts to untangle the web of mystery

You see my dears she explained impressively as the three lounged
upon the grass in the shade of the right wing of the house there is a
very interesting story about these people that ought to guide us
directly to a solution of the puzzle A roving sea captain marries a
girl of good family in spite of the opposition of her relatives His
boatswain a confidential servant marries the girls maid The next
thing we know is that a great trouble causes them to fleedoubtless
some crime committed by the captain It may have been robbery or
perhaps piracy on the high seas who knows Anyhow he steals away to
this forsaken spot far from the sea or the railroads and builds a fine
house on a worthless farm showing that he has money but that
retirement is his main object Here the Weggs make no friends but the
wife cries her eyes out until she dies miserably leaving a son to the
tender mercies of a wicked father So fearful is he of discovery that he
will not allow the boy to go to school but tries to educate
him himself

Probably the captains real name was not Wegg at all suggested
Patsy entering into the spirit of the relation

Probably not dear He would assume some name of course so that it
might be more difficult to trace him answered Louise But nowmark
me well girlsa Nemesis was on the track of this wicked sinner After
many years the man Captain Wegg had wronged or stolen from or
something discovered his enemys hiding place He promptly killed the
Captain and probably recovered the money for its gone Old Thompson
Ethels grandfather happened to be present The murderer also took his
money and

Oh Louise That isnt reasonable objected Beth who had been
following the story carefully

Why not

Because you are making the wronged party as wicked as the man who
wronged him When the avenger found his enemy he might force him to give
up his illgotten gains I agree with you there but he wouldnt be
liable to rob old Thompson Im sure

Beth is right said Patsy stoutly

But old Thompson lost his money at the same time you know at least
his money could never be found afterward And Im sure he was dealt some
blow on the head that made him crazy answered Louise positively

They thought that over

I believe I can explain it girls said Beth presently The avenger
found Captain Wegg all rightjust as Louise has saidand when he
found him he demanded a restitution of his money threatening to send
the criminal to jail That would be very natural wouldnt it Well
Captain Wegg had spent a good deal of the money and couldnt pay it all
back so Ethels grandfather being his friend offered to makeup the
balance himself rather than see his friend go to prison That accounts
for the disappearance of all the money

If that is so observed Patsy I dont see why the man having got
his money back should murder one and knock the other on the head

It way a puzzle they all acknowledged and after discussing the matter
from every conceivable standpoint they were no nearer an explanation
Thats the way with mysteries theyre often hard to understand

The only thing that occurs to me as being sensible said Louise
finally is that after the money was paid over they got into a quarrel
Then the avenger lost his temper and committed the murders

This talk about an avenger is all guess work asserted Beth calmly
I dont believe the facts point to an avenger at all

But the old crimethe great trouble

Oh well allow all that returned Beth and I dont say that an
avenger wouldnt be the nicest person to exact retribution from the
wicked captain But avengers dont always turn up in real life when
they ought to girls so we mustnt be too sure that one turned up in
this case

But now else can you account for the captains murder objected
Louise

Well some one else might know he had money and that Ethels
grandfather had money too was the reply Suppose the robbery and
murder had nothing to do with the old crime at all but that the
murderer knew this to be a deserted place where he could make a good
haul without being discovered The two old men sat in the right wing
quite unsuspicious when

When in walks Mr Murderer chokes the captain knocks his friend on
the brainbox and makes off with the money continued Patsy
gleefully Oh girls Im sure weve got it right this time

Louise reflected a moment

This country is almost a wilderness she mused aloud and few
strangers ever come here Besides a stranger would not know positively
that these two men had money If we abandon the idea of an avenger and
follow Beths clue then the murderer is still right here in Millville
and unsuspected by any of his neighbors

Oh Louise with startled glances over their shoulders

Let us be sensible reasoning girls not silly things trying to figure
out possible romances continued Louise with a pretty and impressive
assumption of dignity Do you know I feel that some angel of
retribution has guided us to this lonely farmhouse and put the idea into
my head to discover and expose a dreadful crime

Succotash cried Patsy irrelevantly Youre romancing this minute
Louise The way you figure things out I wouldnt be surprised if you
accused me or Uncle John any time during the next half hour Adopting
your last supposition for the sake of argument Im interested to know
what inhabitant of sleepy old Millville you suspect

Dont get flighty Patricia admonished Beth This is a serious
matter and Louise is in earnest If were going to help her we mustnt
talk rubbish Now it isnt a bad suggestion that we ought to look
nearer home for the key to this mystery Theres old Hucks

Hucks

To be sure No one knew so well as he the money affairs of the two men
who were robbed

Im ashamed of you said Patsy

And the mans smile is a mask exclaimed Louise

Oh no protested Patsy

My dear no person who ever lived could smile every minute winter and
summer rain or shine day and night and always have a reason for
the smile

Of course not agreed Beth Old Hucks is a curious character I
realized that when I had known him five minutes

But hes poor urged Patsy in defense of the old man He hasnt a
penny in the world and McNutt told me if we turned Thomas and Nora away
theyd have to go to the poorhouse

That is no argument at all said Louise calmly If we consider the
fact that Old Hucks may be a miser and have a craving for money without
any desire to spend it then we are pretty close to a reason why he
should bide his time and then murder his old master to obtain the riches
he coveted Mind you I dont say Hucks is guilty but it is our duty to
consider this phase of the question

And then added Beth if Hucks should prove to be a miser it is easy
to guess he would hide his wealth where he could secretly gloat over it
and still continue to pose as a pauper

I dont believe it said Patsy stoutly

Youll never make a successful detective if you allow your personal
feelings to influence you returned Louise I too sincerely hope
that Thomas is innocent but we are not justified in acquitting him
until we have made a careful investigation and watched his actions

Im quite sure hes connected with the mystery in some way said Beth
It will do no harm to watch Old Hucks as Louise suggests

And you might try to pump him Patsy and see if you can get him to
talk of the murder Some careless remark might give us just the clue we
need and guide us to the real criminal That would free Thomas from all
suspicion you see

But why do you ask me to do this demanded Patsy Thomas and I are
good friends and Id feel like a traitor to try to get him to confess
a murder

If he is innocent you have done no harm said her eldest cousin and
if he is guilty you dont want him for your friend

He likes you dear added Beth and perhaps he will tell you frankly
all we want to know Theres another person though Louise who might
tell us something

Who is that

The little man with the golfball eyes McNutt

Now theres some sense in suspecting him exclaimed Patsy We know
hes a robber already and a man who is clever enough to sell Uncle
John three Lives of the Saints would stick at nothing Im sure

He hasnt enough courage to commit a great crime observed Beth

But he may be able to give us some information Louise asserted so I
propose we walk over to the town tomorrow morning and interview him

This was promptly agreed to for even Patsy the least enthusiastic
detective of the three was eager to find some sort of a solution of the
Wegg mystery Meantime they decided to watch Old Hucks very carefully

Beth happened to be present when Uncle John paid Thomas his weekly wage
that evening and was interested to notice how the old mans hand
trembled with eagerness as he took the money

How much are you accustomed to receive Uncle John had asked

Nothing tall sir since Capn Wegg died was the reply We was glad
enough to have a home Nora an me thout spectin wages

And there was no one here for you to serve mused Uncle John But in
Captain Weggs day how much did he give you

Thomas hesitated and his smile wavered an instant

My old master was also my old friend said he in a low voice an I
ast him fer little money because my needs were little

Well the conditions are now different remarked Uncle John
carelessly and while you are in my employ you shall have your wages
regularly Will ten dollars a week be satisfactory

Oh sir

And five for Nora

You are too good sir II

Never mind Thomas If you want more at any time let me know

It was then as the old man took the fifteen dollars extended to him
that Beth noted a flash in the mild blue eyes and a trembling of the
horny hands Hucks was very glad to get the money there was little
doubt of that

She spoke of this incident to Louise and the following morning they
tested the man again All three girls being present Beth tendered Old
Hucks two dollars saying it was intended as a slight mark of her
appreciation of his attention Thomas demurred at first but on being
urged took the money with the same eager gesture he had before
displayed Louise followed with a donation of a like sum and Patsy gave
the old man still another two dollar bill This generosity so amazed him
that tears stood in his eyes as he tried to thank them all It was
noticed that the smile did not give way even to the tears although it
was tinged with a pathetic expression that proved wonderfully affecting
He concealed the offerings with a stealthy motion as if ashamed of his
weakness in accepting them and then hurried away to his work

Well said Louise when they were alone is Thomas a miser or not

He clutched the money almost as if he loved it observed Beth in a
musing and slightly regretful tone

But think how poor he has been pleaded Patsy and how destitute both
he and Nora are yet Can we blame him for being glad to earn something
substantial at last

Somehow that did not seem to explain fully the old mans behavior and
the girl who had championed him sighed and then gave a sudden shiver as
she remembered the awful suspicion that had fallen upon this strange
individual If the proof must be accepted that Hucks had miserly
instincts had not Beth accidentally stumbled upon a solution of the
whole mystery

But Patsy would not believe it If Thomas open countenance lied it was
hard to put faith in any one



CHAPTER XII

THE BAITING OF PEGGY MNUTT

By this time the three nieces were so thoroughly impressed with the
importance of the task they had undertaken that more ordinary things
failed to interest them Louise longed to solve the mystery Beth wanted
to punish the wrongdoers Patsy yearned to exonerate the friends whom
she imagined unjustly accused Therefore the triple alliance for
detective purposes was a strong one

By mutual agreement they kept the matter secret from Uncle John for
they realized what a triumph it would be to surprise the old gentleman
with proofs of their cleverness To confide in him now would mean to
invite no end of ridicule or good natured raillery for Uncle John had
not a grain of imagination or romance in his nature and would be unable
to comprehend the delights of this secret investigation

Because he was in the dark the significant looks and unnatural gravity
of his nieces in the succeeding days puzzled the poor man greatly

Whats wrong girls he would ask Arent you happy here Do you miss
anything youd like Is it too quiet and dull at Millville to suit you

Oh no they would exclaim We are having a splendid time and would
not leave the farm for anything

And he often noticed them grouped in isolated places and conversing in
low eager tones that proved something was up He felt somewhat
grieved that he was not their confidant since these girls and their
loyal affection for him constituted the chief joy of his life When he
put on his regulation fishing costume and carried his expensive rod and
reel his landing net and creel to the brook for a days sport he could
no longer induce one of his girls to accompany him Even Patsy pleaded
laughingly that she had certain fish to fry that were not to be found
in the brook

Soon the three nieces made their proposed visit to McNutt their idea
being to pump that individual until he was dry of any information he
might possess concerning the Wegg mystery They tramped over to the
village after breakfast one morning and found the agent seated on the
porch before his little office by which name the front room of his
cottage was dignified He was dressed in faded overalls a checked shirt
and a broadbrimmed cheap straw hat His off foot as he called it
with grim humor was painted green and his other foot was bare and might
have been improved in color Both these extremities rested on the rail
of the porch while McNutt smoked a corncob pipe and stared at his
approaching visitors with his disconcerting protruding eyes

Good morning Mr McNutt said Louise pleasantly Weve come to see
if you have any books to sell

The agent drew a long breath He had at first believed they had come to
reproach him for his cruel deception for although his conscience was
wholly dormant he had at times been a bit uneasy concerning his
remarkable book trade

Uncle is making a collection of the Lives of the Saints announced
Patsy demurely At present he has but three varieties of this work
one with several pages missing another printed partly upside down and
a third with a broken corner He is anxious to secure some further
variations of the dee looks Lives if you can supply them

Peggys eyes couldnt stare any harder so they just stared

II haint got no more on hand he stammered fairly nonplussed by
the remarkable statement

No more Oh how sad How disappointed we are said Beth

We were depending so much on you Mr McNutt added Louise in a tone
of gentle reproach

McNutt wiggled the toes of his good foot and regarded them reflectively
These city folks were surely the easiest marks he had ever
come across

Ef ye could wait a few days he began hopefully I might

Oh no we cant possibly wait a single minute declared Patsy
Unless Uncle can get the Saints right away he will lose interest in the
collection and then he wont care for them at all

McNutt sighed dismally Here was a chance to make good money by fleecing
the lambs yet he was absolutely unable to take advantage of it

Yeye couldnt use any duck eggs could ye he said a sudden thought
seeming to furnish him with a brilliant idea

Duck eggs

I got the dumtwistedest extry fine lot o duck eggs ye ever seen

But what can we do with duck eggs inquired Beth wonderingly while
Patsy and Louise tried hard not to shriek with laughter

Wy set em under a hen an hatch em out

Sir said Beth I strongly disapprove of such deceptions It seems to
me that making a poor hen hatch out ducks under the delusion that they
are chickens is one of the most cruel and treacherous acts that
humanity can be guilty of Imagine the poor things feelings when her
children take to water Im surprised you could suggest such a wicked
use for duck eggs

McNutt wiggled his toes again desperately

Cant use any sasfrass roots can ye

No indeed all we crave is the Lives of the Saints

Dont want to buy no land

What have you got to sell

Nuthn jest now But ef yell buy I kin git most anything

Dont go to any trouble on our account sir we are quite content with
our splendid farm

Shoo Thet aint no good

Captain Wegg thought it was answered Louise quickly seizing this
opening Otherwise he would not have built so good a house upon it

The Capn were plumb crazy declared the agent emphatically He
didnt want ter farm when he come here he jest wanted to hide

The girls exchanged quick glances of intelligence

Why

Why repeated McNutt Thets a thing whats puzzled us fer years
miss Some thinks Wegg were a piret some thinks he kidnaped thet pretty
wife o hisn an took her money some thinks he tried to rob ol Will
Thompson an Will killed him an then went crazy hisself Theres all
sorts o thinks goin round but who knows

Dont you Mr McNutt

The agent was flattered by the question As he had said the Weggs had
formed the chief topic of conversation in Millville for years and no
one had a more vivid interest in their history than Marshall McMahon
McNutt He enjoyed gossiping about the Weggs almost as much as he did
selling books

I never thought I had no call to stick my nose inter other folkses
privit doins he said after a few puffs at the corncob pipe But
they kaint hide much from Marsh McNutt when he has his eyes open

Patsy wondered if he could possibly close them The eyelids seemed to be
shy and retiring

I seen what I seen continued the little man glancing impressively at
his attentive audience I seen Capn Wegg livin without workin fer
he never lifted a hand to do even a chore I seen him jest settin
round an smokin his pipe an a glowerin like a devil on evryone
thet come near Say once he ordered me offn his premisesme

What a dreadful man said Patsy Did he buy any Lives of the
Saints

Not a Life He made poor Ol Hucks fetch an carry fer him evry
blessid minnit an never paid him no wages

Are you sure asked Louise

Sure as shootin Hucks haint never been seen to spend a cent in all
the years hes been here

Hasnt he sold berries and fruit since the Captains death

Jest nough to pay the taxes which aint much Ye see young Joe were
away an couldnt raise the tax money so Ol Hucks had to But how they
got enough ter live on him an Nora beats me

Perhaps Captain Wegg left some money suggested Patsy

No when Joe an Hucks ransacked the house arter the Capns death they
couldnt find a dollar Curous Plenty o money till he died n then
not a red cent Curiouser yet Ol Will Thompsons savins dispeared
too an never could be located to this day

Were they robbed do you suppose asked Louise

Natrally But who done it Not Ol Hucks fer hes too honest an
hasnt showed the color of a nickel sense Not Joe cause he had to
borrer five dollars of Bob West to git to the city with Who then

Perhaps said Louise slowly some burglar did it

Aint no burglers round these parts

I suppose not Only book agents remarked Beth

McNutt flushed

Do ye mean as I did it he demanded angrily Do ye mean as I killed
Capn Wegg an druv  Will crazy an robbed the house

His features were fairly contorted and his colorless eyes rolled
fearfully

If you did said Beth coolly you would be sure to deny it

I kin prove a alybi answered the little man calming down somewhat
I kin prove my ol woman had me locked up in the chickencoop thet
night cause I wouldnt split a lot o cordwood thet were full o
knots He cast a half fearful glance over his shoulder toward the
interior of the cottage Next day I split em he added mildly

Perhaps said Louise again someone who knew Captain Wegg in the
days before he came here followed him to his retreat and robbed and
murdered him

Now yeve hit the nail on the head cried the agent slapping his fat
thigh energetically Thets what I allus claimed even when Bob West
jest shook his head an smiled sort o superior like

Who is Bob West asked Louise with interest

Hes our implement man an hardware dealer Bob were the ony one o
the Millville folks thet could git along with Capn Wegg an even he
didnt manage to be any special friend Bobs rich ye know Rich as
blazes Folks do say hes wuth ten thousan dollars but it dont set
Bob up any He jest minds his business an goes on sellin plows an
harvesters to the farmers an takin notes fer em

And you say he knew Captain Wegg well inquired Patsy

Better n most folks round here did Once er twicet a year the Capn
d go to Bobs office an set around an smoke his pipe Sometimes Bob
would go to the farm an spend an evnin but not often Ol Will
Thompson might be said to be the ony friend the Capn really
hankered fer

Id like to meet Mr West said Louise casting a shrewd look at her
cousins For here was another clue unearthed

Hes in his store now remarked McNutt Last buildin on the left Ye
cant miss it

Thank you Good morning sir

Cant use any buttermilk er Dutch cheese

No thank you

McNutt stared after them disconsolately These girls represented so much
money that ought to be in his pockets and they were moreover
innercent as turtle doves but he could think of no way to pluck their
golden quills or even to arrest their flight

Well let em go he muttered This thing aint ended yit



CHAPTER XIII

BOB WEST HARDWARE DEALER

A few steps down the little street brought the girls to the hardware
store quite the most imposing building in town They crossed the broad
platform on which stood samples of heavy farm machinery and entered a
wellstocked room where many articles of hardware and house furnishings
were neatly and systematically arranged

The place seemed deserted for at that time of day no country people
were at Millville but on passing down the aisle the visitor approached
a little office built at the rear of the store Behind the desk Bob West
sat upon his high stool gravely regarding his unusual customers over
the rims of his spectacles

Good morning said Louise taking the lead Have you a stew pan

The merchant left the office and silently walked behind the counter

Large or small miss he then asked

The girls became interested in stew pans which they were scarcely able
to recognize by their official name Mr West offered no comment as they
made their selection

Can you send this to the Wegg farm asked Louise opening her purse to
make payment

West smiled

I have no means of delivering goods said he but if you can wait a
day or two I may catch some farmer going that way who will consent
to take it

Oh Didnt Captain Wegg purchase his supplies in the village asked
the girl

Some of them But it is our custom here to take goods that we purchase
home with us As yet Millville is scarcely large enough to require a
delivery wagon

The nieces laughed pleasantly and Beth said

Are you an old inhabitant Mr West

I have been here thirtyfive years

Then you knew Captain Wegg Louise ventured

Very well

The answer was so frank and free from embarrassment that his questioner
hesitated Here was a man distinctly superior to the others they had
interviewed a man of keen intellect and worldly knowledge who would be
instantly on his guard if he suspected they were crossexamining him So
Louise with her usual tact decided to speak plainly

We have been much interested in the history of the Wegg family she
remarked easily and perhaps it is natural for us to speculate
concerning the characters of our predecessors It was so odd that
Captain Wegg should build so good a house on such a poor farm

Yes

And he was a sea captain who retired far from the sea which he must
have loved

To be sure

It made him dissatisfied they say as well as surly and unsociable
but he stuck it out even after his poor wife died and until the day of
the murder

Murder in a tone of mild surprise

Was it not murder she asked quickly

He gave his shoulders a quiet shrug

The physician pronounced it heart disease I believe

What physician

Eh Why one who was fishing in the neighborhood for trout and staying
at the hotel Old Dr Jackson was in Huntington at the time I
remember

The girls exchanged significant glances and West noted them and smiled
again

That murder theory is a new one to me he said but I see now why it
originated The employment of a strolling physician would give color to
the suspicion

What do you think sir asked Patsy who had been watching the mans
expression closely

I What do I think Why that Captain Wegg died from heart disease as
he had often told me he was sure to do in time

Then what made old Mr Thompson go mad inquired Beth

The shock of his friends sudden death He had been mentally unbalanced
for some time previousnot quite mad you understand but showing by
his actions at times that his brain was affected

Can you explain what became of their money asked Louise abruptly

West gave a start but collected himself in an instant and covered the
action with another shrug

I cannot say what become of their money he answered

It struck both Beth and Louise that his tone indicated he would not
rather than that he could not say Before they had time to ask another
questioned he continued

Will you take the saucepan with you then or shall I try to send it in
a day or so

We will take it if you please answered Louise But as he wrapped it
into a neat parcel she made one more effort

What sort of a young man was Joseph Wegg

Joe A mere boy untried and unsettled A bright boy in his way and
ambitious to have a part in the big world Hes there now I believe

He spoke with an air of relief and handed Louise the parcel

Thank you young ladies Pray call again if I can be of service to
you he added in a brisker tone

They had no recourse but to walk out which they did without further
words Indeed they were all three silent until they had left the
village far behind and were half way to the farm

Then Patsy said inquiringly

Well girls

We have progressed announced Louise seriously

In what way

Several things are impressed upon my mind replied the girl One is
McNutts absurd indignation when he thought we hinted that he was the
murderer

What do you make of that queried Patsy

It suggests that he knows something of the murder even if he is
himself wholly innocent His alibi is another absurdity

Then that exonerated Old Hucks said Patsy relieved

Oh not at all Hucks may have committed the deed and McNutt knows
about it Or they might have been partners in the crime

What else have you learned Louise asked Beth

That the man West knows what became of the money

He seems like a very respectable man asserted Patsy

Outwardly yes but I dont like the cold calculating expression in
his eyes He is the rich man of this neighborhood Do you suppose he
acquired a fortune honestly in this forsaken district where everyone
else is poor as a church mouse

Seems to me said Patsy discontentedly that the plot thickens as
they say in novels If we interview many more people we shall find
ourselves suspecting an army

Not at all my dear replied Louise coldly From our present
knowledge the murder lies between the unknown avenger and Hucks with
the possibility that McNutt is implicated This avenger may be the
stranger who posed as a physician and said Captain Wegg died of heart
disease in order to prevent the simple people from suspecting a murder
His fishing was all a blind Perhaps McNutt was his accomplice That
staring scarecrow would do anything for money And then we come to the
robbery If Hucks did the murder he took the money and perhaps West
the hardware dealer knows this Or West may have arrived at the house
after the mysterious stranger committed the deed and robbed the two
men himself

And perhaps he didnt said Patsy skeptically Do you know girls
Id like to find Joe Wegg He could put us right Im sure

Joe

Yes Why dont we suspect him of something Or Ethel or old Nora

Do be sensible Patsy said Beth impatiently

But Louise walked on a way in silence Presently she remarked

Im glad you mentioned Joe Wegg The boy gives me an idea that may
reconcile many conflicting suspicions

In what way Louise

Ill tell you when Ive thought it out she replied



CHAPTER XIV

THE MAJOR IS PUZZLED

Ethel came frequently to visit the girls at the Wegg farm and at such
times Uncle John treated her with the same affectionate consideration he
bestowed upon his nieces and made her so cordially welcome that the
little school teacher felt entirely at her ease The girls did not
confide to Ethel their investigation of the Wegg mystery but in all
other matters gave her their full confidence Together they made
excursions to the Falls to the natural caves on the rocky hill called
Mount Parnassus or rowed on the lake or walked or drove as the mood
seized them But mostly they loved the shade of the pines and the broad
green beside the quaint mansion Captain Wegg had built and which now
contained all the elements of a modern summer home

Once Louise asked Ethel casually if she knew what great trouble had
come to Hucks and his wife in their early life but the girl frankly
answered that the old people had never referred to anything of the kind
in her presence

Finally a telegram announced the arrival of Major Doyle to join the
party at the farm Patsy was in the seventh heaven of delight and drove
Joe over to the Junction to meet her father on the arrival of the
morning train

The Major was a prime favorite with all the party and his coming infused
new life into the household He was the type of educated polished
openhearted Irish gentleman it is always a delight to meet and Uncle
John beamed upon his brotherinlaw in a way that betokened a hearty
welcome It was a source of much satisfaction to lug the Major over the
farm and prove to him how wise Mr Merrick had been in deciding to spend
the summer on his own property and the Major freely acknowledged that
he had been in error and the place was as charming as anyone could wish
It was a great treat to the grizzled old warrior to find himself in the
country away from every responsibility of work and he promised himself
a fortnight of absolute rest with the recreation of beholding his
beloved Patsy as often as he pleased

Of course the girl would tell her father about the Wegg mystery for
Patsy had a habit of telling him everything therefore the cousins
decided to take the Major freely into their confidence so as to obtain
the benefit of his opinion That could not be done the first day of
course for on that day Uncle John insisted on displaying the farm and
afterward carrying the Major a willing prisoner to watch him fish in the
brook But on the following morning the girls surrounded Patsys father
and with solemn faces recounted their suspicions the important clues
they had unearthed and their earnest desire to right the great wrong
that had been done by apprehending the criminal

The Major smoked his after breakfast cigar and listened attentively The
story told consecutively was quite impressive In spite of his long
experience in buffeting the world the old soldiers heart was still as
simple as that of a child and the recital awakened his sympathies
at once

Tis evident me children said he in his quaint way that youve
shtumbled on the inside of a crime that doesnt show on the outside
Many of the things you mention are so plain that he who runs may read
but Ive remarked that its just the things ye dont suspect in real
life that prove to be the most important

That is true Major commented Louise At first it was just to amuse
ourselves that we became amateur detectives but the developments are so
startling and serious that we now consider it our duty to uncover the
whole dreadful crime in the interests of justice

Just so he said nodding

But Im sure Old Hucks is innocent declared Patsy emphatically

Then he is asserted the Major for Patsys always right even when
shes wrong Ive had me eye on that man Hucks already for hes the
merriest faced villain I ever encountered Do you say hes shy with
you girls

He seems afraid of us or suspicious and wont let us talk to him
answered Beth

Leave him to me proposed the Major turning a stern face but
twinkling eyes upon the group Twill be my task to detect him Leave
him to me young women an Ill put the thumbscrews on him in
short order

Here was the sort of energetic confederate they had longed for The
Majors assurance of cooperation was welcome indeed and while he
entered heartily into their campaign he agreed that no mention of the
affair ought to reach Uncle Johns ears until the case was complete and
they could call upon the authorities to arrest the criminal

Its me humble opinion he remarked that the interesting individual
you call the avenger was put on the trail by someone hereeither
Thomas Hucks or the timbertoed book agent or the respectable hardware
man Being invited to come and do his worst he passed himself as a
docther on a fishing excursion and having with deliberate intent
murthered Captain Wegg got himself called by the coroner to testify
that the victim died of heart disease A very pretty bit of
scoundrelism eh me dears

But the robberwho do you think he was asked Louise

That Ive still to discover You inform me that Hucks is eager for
money and acts like a miser Ive seen the time I was eager for money
meself and theres not a miserly hair on me bald head But exceptions
prove the rule Ill watch our smiling Thomas and make a report later

Within half an hour he was telling Hucks a funny story and slapping the
old man upon the back as familiarly as if he had known him for years He
found an opportunity that same day to give Thomas a dollar in return for
a slight service and was amazed at the eagerness with which the coin
was clutched and the earnestness of the thanks expressed It really did
seem as if the man was fond of money But when the Major tried to draw
Hucks into speaking of his past history and of Captain Weggs singular
life and death the old fellow became reserved at once and evaded the
inquiries most skillfully

That night as the Major strolled in the orchard to smoke his last cigar
after all the others had retired to bed he noticed Hucks leave the back
door of the leanto with a parcel under his arm and pass hurriedly
around the barn After a little hesitation he decided to follow the man
and crept stealthily along in the shadow of the trees and buildings
until he found himself at the edge of the berrypatch that was in the
rear of the outbuildings But there he paused irresolutely for Thomas
had completely disappeared

The Major was puzzled but decided to watch for the mans return So he
took a position where he could watch the rear door of the house and
smoked patiently for nearly an hour before Hucks returned and let
himself quietly in

He said nothing to the girls next day of this mysterious proceeding but
on the following night again took his station in the orchard to watch

Sure enough as soon as the house was quiet the old servant came out
with a bundle underneath his arm but this time he led his blind wife by
the other hand

The Major gave a low whistle and threw away his cigar The night was so
dark that he had little difficulty in following the aged pair closely
enough to keep their shadowy forms in sight without the risk of being
discovered They passed around the barn and along a path that led
through the raspberry bushes back of the yard There were several acres
of these bushes and just now they were fullleaved and almost shoulder
high The path wound this way and that and branched in several
directions Twice the Major thought he had lost his quarry but was
guided aright by their soft footfalls The ground dipped here and there
and as they entered one of the hollows Major Doyle was startled to
observe the twinkle of a dim light ahead A minute later he saw the
outlines of a little frame building and within this Old Hucks and Nora
presently disappeared



CHAPTER XV

THE MAN IN HIDING

Cautiously the Major approached the cabin which seemed to have been
built as a place for the berry pickers to assemble and pack their fruit
It was constructed of rough boards and had a little window in the side
nearest the dwelling house and a door on the opposite side

Creeping near to the window the Major obtained a clear view of the
interior Upon a dilapidated wicker settee which had one end propped
with a box partially reclined the form of a man whose right arm was in
splints and supported by a sling while his head was covered with
plasters and bandages The mans back was toward the window but from
his slender form and its graceful poise the Major imagined him young

Old Nora held the left hand of this mysterious person in a warm clasp
bending now and then to press a kiss upon it while Hucks busied himself
opening the parcel he had brought and arranging various articles of food
on a rickety stand at the head of the couch The old mans smile was
more benevolent and cheery than ever and his actions denoted that
strange suppressed eagerness the Major had marked when he had taken
the money

The three spoke little and in tones so low that the spy outside the
window failed to catch them Soon the injured man began to eat feeding
himself laboriously with his left hand But his hunger was quickly
satisfied and then he lay back wearily upon his pillows while Nora
tenderly spread a coverlet over him

After this the old couple did not linger long Hucks poured some water
from a jug into a tumbler glanced around the little room to see that
everything was in order and thenafter he and Nora had both kissed the
bandaged foreheadblew out the candle and retired

The Major crouched low in the berry bushes until the couple had passed
by then he rose and thoughtfully followed after them

Whatever Patsys father might have thought of the Wegg farm mystery
before this adventure convinced him that the girls were not altogether
foolish in imagining a romance connected with the place And
notwithstanding Patsys loyal defense of Old Hucks he was evidently
tangled up in the affair to a large extent and could explain if he
chose much that was now puzzling the girl detectives

After careful thought the Major decided to confide in Uncle John at
this juncture rather than in the nieces since the latest developments
were more fitted for a mans interference

By good fortune the girls had an engagement the next day and set out
together in the surrey to visit Ethel Thompson and lunch with her in the
rose bower which was the pride of the little school teachers garden
As soon as they were gone the Major hunted up Uncle John and said

Come with me sir

I wont was the brisk reply Im going fishing and whoever wishes
my society must come with me

Youll not catch anything fishing but youre very liable to catch
something if you follow my lead said the Major meaningly

Whats up Gregory

Im not sure what it is John And then he carefully explained his
discovery that an injured man was occupying the cabin in the berry
patch and seemed to be the object of the Hucks tender care

Its the secrecy of the thing that astounds me most sir he added
If all was open and above board Id think little enough of it

Uncle Johns kindly interest was at once aroused and he proposed that
they go directly to the cabin and interview the man in hiding Hucks
being at the time busy in the barn the two men sauntered into the berry
patch without being observed and then walked briskly along the winding
paths until they sighted the building

Pausing at the window they saw the man still reclining upon his cot
and holding in his left hand a bookone of Patsys the Major
observedwhich he was quietly engaged in reading Then they moved
around to the door which Uncle John pushed open

Without hesitation the two men entered and stood gazing down upon the
strange occupant of the place

Good morning said Mr Merrick while the Major nodded a greeting

The man half arose moving stiffly

Pardon me sirs he said rather startled at the interruption I
regret that I am physically unable to receive you with more courtesy

The Major gazed into the partially bandaged face with a glimmer of
awakening recognition

Hm Ha If Im not mistaken said he its Joseph Wegg

Oh is it asked Uncle John looking upon the young man curiously
Whats happened to you Joseph

Just an automobile accident sir The steering gear broke and we went
over an embankment

I see

Are you Mr Merrick sir

Yes

I owe you an apology for intruding upon your premises in this way and
beg you to forgive the seeming impertinence But Ive been rather
unlucky of late sir and without this refuge I dont know what would
have become of me I will explain if you will permit me

Uncle John nodded

After I had squandered the money you paid me through Major Doyle for
this farm in a vain endeavor to protect a patent I had secured I was
forced to become a chauffeur to earn my livelihood I understand
automobiles you know and obtained employment with a wealthy man who
considered me a mere part of his machine When the accident occurred
through no fault of mine I was fortunately the only person injured
but my employer was so incensed over the damage to his automobile that
he never even sent to inquire whether I lived or died At a charity
hospital they tried to mend my breaks and tinker up my anatomy My
shoulderblade was shattered my arm broken in three places and four
ribs were crashed in The wounds in my head are mere abrasions of the
scalp and not serious But it has taken me a long time to mend and the
crowded stuffy hospital got on my nerves and worried me Being
penniless and friendless I wrote to Thomas and asked him if he could
find a way to get me to the old farm for I never imagined you would
yourself take possession of the deserted place you had bought

Thomas and Nora have cared for me since I was born you know and the
old man was greatly distressed by the knowledge of my sad condition He
did not tell me you were here for fear I would hesitate to come but he
sent me the money you had given him and Nora for wages together with
all that the young ladies had kindly given him I was thus enabled to
leave the hospital which I had come to detest and journey to my old
home I arrived at the Junction on a night train and Thomas met me with
your surrey drove me here under cover of darkness and concealed me in
this outoftheway place hoping you would not discover me

I regret that I was thus foisted upon you believe me sir but being
here I have no means of getting away again Thomas Hucks has had little
worldly experience and cannot realize the full extent of the imposition
he has practiced He feeds me from your table and is hoarding up his
money for me against the time I shall have recovered sufficiently to
leave I think that is the full explanation Mr Merrick

Again Uncle John nodded

How are you he asked

Doing finely sir I can walk a little and my appetite is improving
The doctors said my shoulder would never be very strong again but Im
beginning to hope they were mistaken My ribs seem all right and in
another ten days I shall remove the splints from my arm

You have no medical attendance

Not since I left the hospital But I imagine this pure bracing air is
better for me than a dozen doctors was the cheerful reply

And what are your future plans

The young man smiled He was little more than a boy but his questioner
noticed that he had a fine manly face and his eye was clear and
steadfast

Nothing further than to get to work again as soon as I am able to
undertake it he said

Uncle John looked thoughtfully and drummed with his finger upon the
little table

Joseph he remarked presently I bought this farm at a price
altogether too small considering its value

The boy flushed

Please do not say that he exclaimed hastily I am well aware that I
virtually robbed you and my only excuse is that I believed I would win
my fight and be able to redeem the place But that is over now and you
must not think that because I am ill and helpless I am an object
of charity

Phoo said the little man arent you accepting charity from Old
Hucks

But he stands as a second father to me He is an old retainer of my
family and one of my ambitions is to secure a home for him and Nora in
their old age No I do not feel at all embarrassed in accepting money
or assistance from Thomas

Young man said Uncle John sternly one of the follies of youth is
the idea of being independent of the goodwill of your fellowcreatures
Every person who lives is dependent on some other person for something
or other and Ill not allow you to make a fool of yourself by refusing
to let me take you in hand Your brain is affected

It is not

You are mentally unbalanced and need a guardian Thats me You are
helpless and cannot resist so youre my prisoner Dare to defy me dare
to oppose my wishes in any way and Ill have you put in a
straightjacket and confined in a padded cell Understand me sir

Joseph Wegg looked into the little mans round face until the tears
filled his own eyes and blurred his vision

Wont you protect me Major Doyle he asked weakly

Not I said the Major stoutly This brotherinlaw of mine who
connected himself with me without asking permission is a perfect demon
when roused and Ill not meddle with any opposition to his desires If
you value your life and happiness Joseph Wegg youll accept Mr
Merrick as a guardian until he resigns of his own accord and then its
likely youll wish he hadnt

I dont deserve began the young man brokenly but Uncle John
quickly interrupted him

No one deserves anything said he but everyone gets something or
other nevertheless in this vale of tears If youll kindly remember
that youve no right to express an opinion in the presence of your
guardian well get along better together Now then youre going to
leave here because the place is not comfortable My guests fill every
room in my house so you cant go there But the hotel in Millville is a
cheerfullooking place and Ive noticed some vinecovered windows that
indicate pleasant and sunny rooms Major go and tell Hucks to hitch
that groaning balky Daniel to the ancient buggy and then to drive this
young man over to the hotel Well walk

The Major started at once and Uncle John continued I dont know
whether this arrangement suits you or not Joseph but it suits me and
as a matter of fact its none of your business Feel able to take
a ride

The boy smiled gratefully

Yes indeed Mr Merrick said he and was shrewd enough not to
venture a word of thanks



CHAPTER XVI

A MATTER OF SPECULATION

Old Hucks still smiling but dreadfully nervous over the discovery of
Joe and Mr Merricks sudden activity in the boys behalf speedily
harnessed Daniel and induced the reluctant steed to amble down the path
to the cabin Leaning on Uncle Johns arm the invalid walked to the
buggy and was assisted to mount to the seat beside Thomas Then away
they started and although Dan obeyed Hucks more willingly than any
other driver the Major and Uncle John walked crosslots and reached
the hotel a good fifteen minutes in advance of the equipage

The Millville Hotel depended almost entirely for patronage upon the
commercial travelers who visited the place periodically to sell goods to
the merchants and these did not come too often because trade was never
very energetic and orders never very large Bob West boarded at the
hotel and so did Ned Long a farm hand who did sundry odd jobs for
anyone who needed him and helped pay his keep by working for Mrs
Kebble when not otherwise engaged

Mrs Kebble was the landlady and a famous cook Kate Kebble a
slatternly girl of sixteen helped her mother do the work and waited on
the table Chet Kebble the landlord was a silent old man with
billygoat whiskers and one stray eye which being constructed of
glass usually assumed a slanting gaze and refused to follow the
direction of its fellow Chet minded the billiardroom which was mostly
patronized Saturday nights and did a meager business in fire insurance
but he was so eternal lazy an shifless as Mrs Kebble sharply
asserted that he was considered more a hangeron of the establishment
than its recognized head

The little rooms of the hotel were plainly furnished but maintained with
exceptional neatness

The one in the east corner of the second floor met with the approval of
Uncle John and the Major and was promptly engaged It was cheerful and
sunny with outlooks on the lake and the village and contained a lounge
as well as the bed

When the invalid arrived he was assisted to this apartment and
installed as its permanent occupant

Any baggage asked Mr Merrick

Theres a small trunk lying at the Junction said Joe but it
contains little of importance

Well make yourself at home my boy and get well at your leisure
remarked Uncle John Mrs Kebble has promised to look after you and
the Major and I will stop in now and then and see how you progress

Then he went out engaged Nick Thorne to go to the Junction for the
boys trunk and selected several things at the store that he thought
might be useful to the invalid Afterward he marched home again beside
the Major feeling very well pleased with his mornings work

When the girls reached home late in the afternoon they were thrown into
a state of great excitement by the news briefly related by their uncle
that Joseph Wegg had returned to Millville considerably smashed by an
automobile accident and was now stopping at the village hotel
for repairs

They refrained from making remarks upon the incident until they were
alone when the secret council of three decided to make Joe Weggs
acquaintance as soon as possible to discover what light the young man
might be able to throw upon the great mystery

Do you know girls said Louise impressively it almost seems as if
fate had sent Joe Wegg here to be an instrument in the detection of the
murderer and robber of his poor father

If Joe knew about it why didnt he track the villain down himself
inquired Patsy

Perhaps he hasnt suspected the truth said Beth Often those who are
closely concerned with such tragedies do not observe the evidences of
crime as clearly as outsiders

Where did you get that information demanded Patsy

From one of Anna Doyle Oppenheims detective stories answered Beth
seriously Ive been reading up on such things lately

Detective stories said Louise reflectively are only useful in
teaching us to observe the evidences of crime This case for example
is so intricate and unusual that only by careful thought and following
each thread of evidence to its end can we hope to bring the criminal
to justice

That seems to me conceited observed Miss Doyle composedly
Detective stories dont have to stick to facts or rather they can
make the facts to be whatever they please So I dont consider them as
useful as they are ornamental And this isnt a novel girls its
mostly suspicion and slander

You dont seem able to be in earnest about anything objected Beth
turning a little red

But I try to be said Patricia

We are straying from the subject now under discussion remarked
Louise I must say that I feel greatly encouraged by the sudden
appearance of the Wegg boy He may know something of his fathers former
associates that will enable us to determine the object of the murder and
who accomplished it

Captain Wegg was killed over three years ago suggested Miss Doyle
recovering easily from her rebuff By this time the murderer may have
died or moved to Madagascar

He is probably living within our reach never suspecting that justice
is about to overtake him asserted Louise We must certainly go to
call upon this Wegg boy and draw from him such information as we can I
am almost certain that the end is in sight

We havent any positive proof at all yet observed Patsy musingly

We have plenty of circumstantial evidence returned Beth There is
only one way to explain the facts we have already learned and the
theory we have built up will be a hard one to overthrow The flight of
Captain Wegg to this place his unhappy wife the great trouble that old
Nora has hinted at the

The great trouble ought to come first declared Louise It is the
foundation upon which rest all the mysterious occurrences following and
once we have learned what the great trouble was the rest will be
plain sailing

I agree with you said Beth and perhaps Joseph Wegg will be able to
tell us what the trouble was that ruined the lives of his parents as
well as of Old Hucks and his wife and caused them all to flee here to
hide themselves

It was not until the following morning that the Major found an
opportunity to give the confederates a solemn wink to indicate he had
news to confide to them They gathered eagerly on the lawn and he told
them of the finding of Joe Wegg in the isolated cabin and how old
Thomas and Nora loving the boy as well as if he had been their own
child had sacrificed everything to assist him in his extremity

So ye see my avenging angels that ye run off the track in the Hucks
matter he added smiling at their bewildered faces

Patsy was delighted at this refutation of the slanderous suspicions that
Thomas was a miser and his smiling face a mask to hide his innate
villainy The other girls were somewhat depressed by the overthrow of
one of their pet theories and reluctantly admitted that if Hucks had
been the robber of his master and old Will Thompson he would not have
striven so eagerly to get enough money to send to Joe Wegg But they
pointed out that the old servant was surely hiding his knowledge of
Captain Weggs past and could not be induced to clear up that portion
of the mystery which he had full knowledge of So while he might be
personally innocent of the murder or robbery both Beth and Louise were
confident he was attempting to shield the real criminal

But who is the real criminal inquired Patsy

Let us consider answer Louise with the calm businesslike tone she
adopted in these matters There is the strolling physician whom we
call the Unknown Avenger for one A second suspect is the man McNutt
whose nature is so perverted that he would stick at nothing The third
suspicious individual is Mr Bob West

Oh Louise Mr West is so respectable and so prosperous exclaimed
Patsy

Its a far jump from McNutt to West added Beth

Leaving out Hucks continued Louise her eyes sparkling with the
delightful excitement of maintaining her theories against odds here
are three people who might have been concerned in the robbery or murder
Two of them are under our hands perhaps Joseph Wegg may be able to tell
us where to find the third

They pleaded so hard with the Major to take them to call upon the
injured youth that very day that the old gentleman consented and
without telling Uncle John of their plans they drove to Millville in
the afternoon and alighted at the hotel

The Major went first to the boys room and found him not only very
comfortable but bright and cheerful in mood

At this rate sir he said smilingly I shall be able to discharge
my guardian in quick time Im twice the man I was yesterday

Ive brought some young ladies to call upon you announced the Major
Will you see them

Joe flushed at first remembering his plastered skull and maimed
condition But he could not well refuse to receive his callers whom he
guessed to be the three girls Old Hucks had praised to him so highly

It will give me great pleasure sir he replied

An invalid is usually of interest to women so it is no wonder that the
three young ladies were at once attracted by the brightfaced boy who
reclined upon his couch before the vinecovered windows They thought of
Ethel too and did not marvel that the girl grieved over the loss of
this friend of her childhood

Joe had to recount the adventure with the automobile which led to his
injuries and afterward give an account of his life at the hospital
That led naturally to the timely assistance rendered him by the
faithful Thomas so that Louise was able to broach the subject nearest
her heart

We have been greatly interested in your old servantswhom we acquired
with the farm it seemsand all of us admire their simplicity and
sincerity she began

Nora is a dear added Beth

And Thomas is so cheerful that his smile is enough to vanquish any
attack of the blues said Patsy

The Hucks are the right sort and no mistake declared the Major
taking his cue from the others

This praise evidently delighted the boy They could have found no more
direct way to win his confidence

Nora was my mothers maid from the time she was a mere girl said he
and Thomas sailed with my father many years before I was born

They were a little surprised to hear him speak so frankly But Louise
decided to take advantage of the opening afforded her

Nora has told us that some great trouble came to them years agoa
trouble that also affected your own parents But they do not wish to
talk about it to us

His face clouded

No indeed said he Their loving old hearts have never recovered
from the blow Would you like to know their history It is a sad story
and pitiful but I am sure you would understand and appreciate my old
friends better after hearing it

Their hearts fairly jumped with joy Would they like to hear the story
Was it not this very clue which they had been blindly groping for to
enable them to solve the mystery of the Wegg crime The boy marked their
interest and began his story at once while the hearts of the three
girls sanggladly At lastat last



CHAPTER XVII

JOE TELLS OF THE GREAT TROUBLE

As a young man my father was a successful sea captain said the boy
and before he was thirty owned a considerable interest in the ship he
sailed Thomas Hucks was his boatswainan honest and able seaman in
whom my father became much interested Hucks was married and his wife
was an attendant in the employ of Hugh Carter a wealthy ship chandler
of Edmunton the port from which my fathers ship sailed Thomas had some
difficulty in enjoying his wifes society when on shore because old
Carter did not want him hanging around the house so Captain Wegg
goodnaturedly offered to intercede for him

Carter was a gruff and disagreeable man and although my father had
been a good customer he refused his request and threatened to discharge
Nora which he did This made Captain Wegg angry and he called upon
Mary Carter whose especial attendant Nora had been to ask her to take
the girl back Mary was a mild young lady who dared not oppose her
father but the result of the interview was that the sea captain and
Mary Carter fell mutually in love During the next two or three years
whenever the ship was in port the lovers frequently met by stealth at
the cottage of Mrs Hucks a little place Thomas had rented Here my
father and mother were finally married

Meantime Nora had a son a fine young chap Ive heard and presently
my mother who had a little fortune of her own plucked up enough
courage to leave her fathers roof and took up her abode in a pretty
villa on the edge of a bluff overlooking the sea Nora came to live with
her again bringing her child and the two women were company for one
another while their husbands were at sea

In course of time my mother had two children a girl and a boy and
because the Hucks boy was considerably older than they he took care of
them to a great extent and the three youngsters were always together
Their favorite playground was on the beach at the foot of the bluff
and before young Tom was ten years old he could swim like a duck and
manage a boat remarkably well The Wegg children having something of
their mothers timid nature perhaps were not so adventurous but they
seldom hesitated to go wherever Tom led them

One day while my mother was slightly ill and Nora was attending to
her Tom disobeyed the commands that had been given him and took his
younger companions out on the ocean for a ride in his boat No one knows
how far they went or exactly what happened to them but a sudden squall
sprang up and the children being missed my mother insisted ill as she
was in running down to the shore to search for her darlings Braving
the wind and drenched by rain the two mothers stood side by side
peering into the gloom while brave men dared the waves to search for
the missing ones The body of the girl was first washed ashore and my
mother rocked the lifeless form in her arms until her dead son was laid
beside her Then young Toms body was recovered and the horror
was complete

When my father arrived three days later he not only found himself
bereaved of the two children he had loved so tenderly but his young
wife was raving with brain fever and likely to follow her babies to the
grave During that terrible time Nora who could not forget that it was
her own adventurous son who had led all three children to their death
went suddenly blindfrom grief the doctors said

My father pulled his wife back to life by dint of careful nursing but
whenever she looked at the sea she would scream with horror so it
became necessary to take her where the cruel sound of the breakers could
never reach her ears I think the grief of Thomas and Nora was scarcely
less than that of my own parents and both men had suffered so severely
that they were willing to abandon the sea and devote their lives to
comforting their poor wives Captain Wegg sold all his interests and his
wifes villa and brought the money here where he established a home
amid entirely different surroundings He was devoted to my mother I
have heard and when she died soon after my birth the Captain seemed
to lose all further interest in life and grew morose and unsociable
with all his fellowcreatures

That young ladies is the story of what Thomas and Nora call their
great trouble and I think it is rightly named because it destroyed
the happiness of two families I was born long after the tragedy but
its shadow has saddened even my own life

When the boy had finished his voice trembling with emotion as he
uttered the last words his auditors were much affected by the sad tale
Patsy was positively weeping and the Major blew his nose vigorously and
advised his daughter to dry up an be sinsible Beths great eyes
stared compassionately at the young fellow and even Louise for the
moment allowed her sympathy to outweigh the disappointment and chagrin
of seeing her carefully constructed theory of crime topple over like the
house of cards it was There was now no avenger to be discovered
because there had been nothing to avenge The simple yet pathetic story
accounted for all the mystery that in her imagination enveloped the
life and death of Captain Wegg Butstay

How did your father die she asked softly

Through a heart trouble from which he had suffered for years and
which had obliged him to lead a very quiet life was the reply That
was one of the things which after my mothers death helped to sour his
disposition He could not return to the sea again because he was told
that any sudden excitement was likely to carry him off and indeed
that was exactly what happened

How is that sir asked the Major

It is more difficult to explain than the first of the story replied
the boy thoughtfully gazing through the window perhaps because I do
not understand it so well Our simple life here never made much of an
inroad into my fathers modest fortune for our wants were few but
Captain Wegg was a poor man of business having been a sailor during all
his active life His only intimate friendan honest bluff old farmer
named Will Thompsonwas as childish regarding money matters as my
father but had a passion for investments and induced my father to join
some of his schemes Mr Thompsons mind was somewhat erratic at times
but keen in some ways nevertheless Fearing to trust his judgment
entirely my father chose to lean upon the wisdom and experience of a
shrewd merchant of Millville named Robert West

The hardware dealer asked Louise impulsively

Yes I see you have met him replied Joseph Wegg with a smile at the
eager pretty face of his visitor Bob West was a prosperous man and
very careful about his own investments so he became a sort of business
adviser to my father and Mr Thompson and arbitrated any differences of
opinion they might have For several years due to Wests good offices
the two oddly mated friends were successful in their ventures and added
to their capital Finally West came to them himself with a proposition
He had discovered a chance to make a good deal of money by purchasing an
extensive pine forest near Almaquo just across the border in Canada
West had taken an option on the property when he found by accident that
the PierceLane Lumber Company was anxious to get hold of the tract and
cut the timber on a royalty that would enable the owners to double their
investment

Howld on a jiffy cried the Major excitedly Did I understand you to
say the PierceLane Lumber Company

That was the firm sir I used to overhear my father and Will Thompson
talking about this matter but I must admit my knowledge is somewhat
imperfect because I never was allowed to ask questions I remember
learning the fact that West had not enough money to swing his option
and so urged his friends to join him Relying upon Wests judgment they
put all their little fortunes into the deal although Thompson grumbled
at doing so because he claimed he had another investment that was
better and this matter of Wests would prevent him from undertaking it
The Almaquo tract was purchased and a contract made with the lumber
company to cut the timber and pay them a royalty of so much a thousand
feet Yet although the prospects for profit seemed so good I know that
for some reason both my father and Thompson were dissatisfied with the
deal and this may be accounted for by the fact that every penny of
their money was tied up in one investment West used to come to the
house and argue with them that the property was safe as the Bank of
England and then old Will would tell him how much more he could have
made out of another investment he had in mind so that a coolness grew
up between West and the others that gradually led to their estrangement

I can well remember the evening when Bob Wests pretty financial bubble
burst Thompson and my father were sitting together in the right wing
smoking solemnly and exchanging a few words as was their custom when
West arrived with a while face and a newspaper under his arm I was in
the next room lying half asleep upon the sofa when I heard West cry
despairingly Ruinedruinedruined I crept to the halfopened
door then and looked in Both men were staring openmouthed and
halfdazed at West who was explaining in a trembling voice that a
terrible forest fire had swept through the Almaquo section and wiped out
every tree upon the property He had the full account in the newspaper
and had begun reading it when my father uttered a low moan and tumbled
off his chair to the floor

Will Thompson gave a wild cry and knelt beside him

My God hes dead Bobhes deadand youve killed him with your
good news he screamed already raving and then Old Hucks ran in just
in time to prevent the madman from throttling West for his fingers were
even then twined around Bobs throat There was a desperate struggle
and I remember that scared as I was I joined Thomas in trying to pull
Thompson off his prey But suddenly old Will threw up his arms and
toppled backward still raving like a demon but unable to move his body
from the waist downward West helped us to put him in bed and said he
was paralyzed which afterward proved to be the truth Also his mind
was forever gone and I think it was fathers death that did that
rather than the loss of his money

They were all staring whitefaced at the speaker Most of the mystery
was being cleared away indeed there was now little of mystery
remaining at all

West hurried after a doctor continued Joe who was almost as much
absorbed in his story as were his listeners and spoke in a reflective
musing way and he succeeded in finding one who was stopping for a few
days at the hotel Poor Bob was very kind to us in our trouble and I
never heard him mention a word about his own losses which must have
been severe After the funeral was over and I found I had nothing to
inherit but the farm I decided to go to the city and make my way there
as I had long wished to do West gave me a little money to start me on
my way and the rest of my story is not very interesting to anybody
Major Doyle knows something of it after the time when I got through my
technical school by working as a servant to pay for my instruction Im
a failure in life so far young ladies but if youll not bear that
against me Ill try to do better in the future

Good cried the Major approvingly as he took the boys left hand in
both his own and pressed it Youre developing the right spirit
Joseph me lad and well think no more about the sadness of the past
but look forward to the joy of your future

Of course said Patsy nodding gravely Joe Wegg is bound to be a
great man some day



CHAPTER XVIII

THE LOCKED CUPBOARD

Louise and Beth returned to the farm in dismal silence Every prop had
been knocked from beneath their carefully erected temple of mystery Now
there was no mystery at all

In a few words Joe Wegg had explained everything and explained all so
simply and naturally that Louise felt like sobbing with the bitterness
of a child deprived of its pet plaything The band of selfconstituted
girl detectives had been put out of business as Patsy said because
the plain fact had developed that there was nothing to detect and never
had been There had been no murder no robbery no flight or hiding on
the part of the Weggs to escape an injured enemy nothing even
mysterious in the light of the story they had just heard It was
dreadfully humiliating and thoroughly disheartening after all their
earnest endeavor to investigate a crime that had never been committed

Uncle John rallied his nieces on their somber faces at the dinner table
and was greatly amused when the Major despite the appealing looks
directed at him gave Mr Merrick a brief resume of the afternoons
developments

Well I declare said the little man merrily didnt I warn you
Louise not to try to saddle a murder onto my new farm How you foolish
girls could ever have imagined such a carnival of crime in connection
with the Weggs is certainly remarkable

I dont know about that sir returned the Major seriously I was
meself inoculated with the idea and for a while I considered meself and
the girls the equals of all the Pinkertons in the country And when ye
come to think of it the history of poor Captain Wegg and his wife and
of Nora and Thomas as well is out of the ordinary entirely and
without the explanation contained all the elements of a
firstclass mystery

How did you say the Weggs lost their money inquired Uncle John
turning the subject because he saw that it embarrassed his nieces

Why forest fires at Almaquo in Canada burned down the timber they
had bought replied the Major And by the way John youre
interested in that matter yourself for the PierceLane Lumber Company
in which you own a lot of stock had contracted to cut the timber on
a royalty

How long ago

Three years sir

Well weve been cutting timber at Almaquo ever since said Mr
Merrick

Louise dropped her fork with a clatter disclosing in this wellbred
young lady an unusual degree of excitement

Then there is something to detect she cried

Eh What do you mean inquired her uncle

If youve been cutting timber at Almaquo for three years the trees
couldnt have burned down Louise declared triumphantly

That is evident said the Major dryly Ive had it in me mind
Louise to take that matter up for investigation but you are so imbued
with the detective spirit that theres no heading you off a trail

Before the dessert comes on announced Uncle John impressively I
want to make a statement You folks have tried your hands at the
detective business and made a mess of it Now its my turn Ill be a
detective for three days and if I dont succeed better than you did
young women well mingle our tears in all humility Eh Major

Put me in the bunch sir said the old soldier I was as bad as any
of them And go ahead in your own way if ye like Its me humble
opinion John that youre no Sherlock Holmes but ye wont believe it
til ye satisfy yourself of the fact

Next morning the loungers around Sam Cottings store were thrown into a
state of great excitement when the nabob came over from the Wegg farm
and held the longdistance telephone for more than an hour while he
talked with people in New York The natives knew that their telephone
which was built into a small booth at one end of the storenext the
postoffice boxeswas part of a system that made it possible for one to
talk to those in far away cities Often the country people would eye the
mysteriouslooking instrument with awe and whisper to each other of its
mighty powers but no one had ever before used it to telephone farther
than the Junction and then only on rare occasions

Itll cost a heap o money Sam said McNutt uneasily while Uncle
John was engaged in his remarkable conversation They could see him in
the booth through the little window

It will Mac was the solemn reply But the fool nabob may as well
spend it thet way as any other Its mighty little of his capital er
surplus gits inter my cashdrawer n thets a fact

Uncle John came from the booth perspiring but smiling and happy He
walked across the street to see Joe Wegg and found the youth seated in
a rockingchair and looking quite convalescent But he had company In a
chair opposite sat a man neatly dressed with a thin intelligent face
a stubby gray moustache and shrewd eyes covered by hornrimmed
spectacles

Good morning Mr Merrick said Joe cheerily this is Mr Robert
West one of the Millville merchants who is an old friend of
our family

Ive heard of Mr West and Im glad to meet him replied Uncle John
looking at the other calmly but not offering to shake hands I believe
you are the president and treasurer of the Almaquo Timber Tract Company
are you not

Joseph looked startled and then embarrassed as he overheard the
question West without altering his position of careless ease glanced
over the rims of his glasses at the speaker

I am the humble individual you refer to Mr Merrick he said
briefly

But the Almaquo timber all burned down remarked Joe thinking an
explanation was needed

Thats a mistake returned Mr Merrick My company has paid Mr West
as treasurer of his company more than fifty thousand dollars during the
last three years

Wests jaw dropped

Your company he exclaimed as if mystified

Yes I own the controlling interest in the PierceLane Lumber Company
which has the contract to cut your timber answered Mr Merrick

The hardware dealer slowly arose and glanced at his watch

I must get back to my store he said You are somewhat in error about
your company Mr Merrick but I suppose your interests are so large and
varied that you cannot well keep track of them Good morning sir Ill
see you again soon Joe Glad youre improving so rapidly Let me know
if I can do anything to help you

With these quiet words he bowed and left the room and when he had
gone Joe said in a deprecating tone

Poor Bob must be very unhappy about having lost my fathers money in
that speculation for he advocated the plan very strongly believing it
was a good investment Im afraid your mistake about paying him all that
money upset him Dont mind if he was a little brusque sir Bob West is
a simple kindly man whom my father fully trusted It was he that
loaned me the money to get away from here with

Tell me said Uncle John thoughtfully did your father receive stock
in the Almaquo Timber Tract Company in exchange for his money

Oh yes I have seen it in the steel cupboard replied Joe

Where is that

Why it is the cupboard in the right wing of our house which was the
Captains own room It was one of his whims when he built to provide
what he called his bank You may have noticed the wooden doors of a
cupboard built into the stone wall sir

Yes I occupy the room

Behind the wooden doors are others of steel The entire cupboard is
steellined Near the bottom is a slidingplate which when pushed
aside discovers a hidden drawera secret my father never confided to
anyone but me He once told me that if his heart trouble earned him off
suddenly I ought to know of the existence of this drawer so he showed
me how to find it On the day after his death I took the keys which he
always carried on a small chain around his neck and concealed underneath
his clothing and opened the cupboard to see if I could find anything of
value It is needless to say I could not discover anything that could
be converted into a dollar The Captain had filled the cupboard with old
letters and papers of no value and with relics he had brought from
foreign lands during his many voyages These last are mere rubbish but
I suppose he loved them for their association In the secret drawer I
found his stock in the timber company and also that of old Will
Thompson who had doubtless left it with my father for safekeeping
Knowing it was now worthless I left it in the drawer

Id like to see it announced Uncle John

Joe laughed

Ive lost the keys he said

Hows that my lad

Why on the day of the funeral the keys disappeared I could never
imagine what became of them But I did not care to look in the cupboard
a second time so the loss did not matter

Mr Merrick seemed thoughtful

I suppose I own that cupboard now he remarked

Of course said Joe But without the keys it is not serviceable If
you drill through the steel doors you destroy their security

True but I may decide to do that

If you do sir Id like you to clear out the rubbish and papers and
send them to me They are family matters and I did not intend to sell
them with the place

You shall have them Joe

Just underneath the left end of the lower shelf you will find the
sliding steel plate It slides toward the front In the drawer you will
find the worthless stock and a picture of my mother Id like to keep
the picture

You shall Joseph How are you getting on

Why Im a new man Mr Merrick and today Im feeling as strong as a
buffalothanks to your kind guardianship

Dont overdo sir Take it easy Theres a young lady coming to see you
today

Ethel the boy exclaimed his face turning crimson

Yes returned Uncle John tersely Youve treated that girl
shamefully Joseph Wegg Try to make proper amends

I never could understand said Joe slowly why Ethel refused to
answer the letter I wrote her when I went away It explained
everything yet

Ill bet the farm against your lame shoulder she never got your
letter declared Uncle John She thought you left her without a word

I gave it to McNutt to deliver after I was gone But you say shes
coming today

That is her intention sir

Joe said nothing more but his expressive face was smiling and eager
Uncle John pressed the boys hand and left him promising to call
again soon

Now then muttered the little millionaire as he walked down the
street to beard the lion in his den

The den proved to be the hardware store and the lion none other than
Robert West Mr Merrick found the merchant seated at his desk in the
otherwise deserted store and with a nod helped himself to the only
other chair the little office contained

Sir said he I am here to demand an explanation

Of what asked West coldly

Of your action in the matter of the Almaquo Timber Tract Company I
believe that you falsely asserted to Captain Wegg and Mr Thompson that
the timber had burned and their investment was therefore worthless The
news of the disaster killed one of your confiding friends and drove the
other mad but that was a consequence that I am sure you did not intend
when you planned the fraud The most serious thing I can accuse you of
is holding the earnings of the Wegg and Thompson stockand big earnings
they are toofor your own benefit and defrauding the heirs of your
associates of their money

West carefully balanced a penholder across his fingers and eyed it with
close attention

You are a queer man Mr Merrick he said quietly I can only excuse
your insults on the grounds of ignorance or the fact that you have been
misinformed Here is the newspaper report of the Almaquo fire which I
showed my friends the night of Captain Weggs sudden death He took a
clipping from a drawer of the desk and handed it to Uncle John who read
it carefully

As a matter of fact continued West you are not cutting that portion
of the Almaquo tract which this fire refers to and which Thompson and
Wegg were interested in but the north half of the tract which they had
never acquired any title to

I suppose the stock will show that suggested Mr Merrick

Of course sir

I will look it up

West smiled

You will have some trouble doing that he said

Why

Wegg and Thompson had transferred their entire stock to me before one
died and the other went mad was the quiet reply

Oh I see The lie was so evident that Uncle John did not try to
refute it

I am rather busy Mr Merrick Anything more sir

Not today Bye and bye Mr West

He marched out again and climbed into his buggy to drive home The
interview with Bob West had made him uneasy for the merchants cold
crafty nature rendered him an opponent who would stick at nothing to
protect his illgotten gains Uncle John had thought it an easy matter
to force him to disgorge but West was the one inhabitant of Millville
who had no simplicity in his character He was as thoroughly imbued with
worldly subtlety and cunning as if he had lived amid the grille of a
city all his life and Mr Merrick was by no means sure of his own
ability to unmask the man and force him to make restitution



CHAPTER XIX

THE COURTN OF SKIM CLARK

By this time the summer was well advanced and the rich people at the
Wegg farm had ceased to be objects of wonder to the Millville folk The
girls were still regarded with curious looks when they wandered into the
village on an errand and Mr Merrick and Major Doyle inspired a certain
amount of awe but time had dulled the edge of marvelous invasion and
the city people were now accepted as a matter of course

Peggy McNutt was still bothering his head over schemes to fleece the
strangers in blissful ignorance of the fact that one of his neighbors
was planning to get ahead of him

The Widow Clark was a shrewd woman She had proven this by becoming one
of the merchants of Millville after her husbands death The poor man
had left an insurance of five hundred dollars and the little frame
building wherein he had conducted a harness shop Mrs Clark couldnt
make and repair harness so she cleared the straps and scraps and
waxends out of the place painted the interior of the shop bright
yellow with a blue ceiling erected some shelves and a counter and
turned part of the insurance money into candy cigars stationery and a
meager stock of papercovered novels

Skim her small son helped her as far as he was able and between them
they managed things so frugally that at the end of eight years the widow
still had her five hundred dollars capital and the little store had
paid her living expenses

Skim was named after his uncle Peter Skimbley who owned a farm near
Watertown The widows hopeful was now a lank palefaced youth of
eighteen whose most imposing features were his big hands and a long
nose that ended in a sharp point The shop had ruined him for manual
labor for he sat hunched up by the stove in winter and in summer hung
around Cottings store and listened to the gossip of the loungers He
was a boy of small conversational powers but his mother declared that
Skim done a heap o thinkin that nobody suspected

The widow was a good gossip herself and knew all the happenings in the
little town She had a habit of reading all her stock of papercovered
novels before she sold them and her mind was stocked with the mass of
romance and adventure she had thus absorbed What I loves moren eatn
or sleepn she often said is a rattlin good love story There
dont seem to be much love in real life so a poor lone crittur like me
has to calm her hankerins by areadin novels

No one had been more interested in the advent of the millionaire at the
Wegg farm than the widow Clark She had helped fix up the house for
the new owner and her appreciative soul had been duly impressed by the
display of wealth demonstrated by the fine furniture sent down from the
city She had watched the arrival of the party and noticed with eager
eyes the group of three pretty and stylishly dressed nieces who
accompanied their rich uncle Once or twice since the young ladies had
entered her establishment to purchase pens or stationery and on such
occasions the widow was quite overcome by their condescension

All this set her thinking to some purpose One day she walked over to
the farm and made her way quietly to the back door By good fortune she
found blind Nora hemming napkins and in a mood to converse Nora was an
especially neat seamstress but required some one to thread her needles
Mary the cook had been doing this but now Mrs Clark sat down beside
Nora to hev a little talk and keep the needles supplied with thread

She learned a good deal about the nieces for old Nora could not praise
them enough They were always sweet and kind to her and she loved to
talk about them They were all rich too or would be for their uncle
had no children of his own and could leave several millions to each one
when he died

An theyre so simple too said the old woman nothin cityfied ner
stuckup about any on em I kin tell ye They dresses as fine as the
Queen o Sheba Tom says but they romp round just like they was borned
in the country Miss Patsy shes learnin to milk the cow an Miss Beth
takes care o the chickens all by herself Theyre reglar girls Marthy
Clark an money haint spiled em a bit

This report tended to waken a great ambition in the widows heart Or
perhaps the ambition had already taken form and this gossip confirmed
and established it Before she left the farm she had a chance to
secretly observe the girls and they met with her full approval

At supper that evening she said to her hopeful

Skim I want ye to go courtin

Skim looked up in amazement

Me ma he asked

Yes you Its time you was thinkin of gittin married

Skim held his knife in his mouth a moment while he thought over this
startling proposition Then he removed the cutlery heaved a deep sigh
and enquired

Who at ma

Whats that

Wholl I go courtin at

Skim you member in thet las book we read The Angel Maniacs
Revenge there was a sayin that fate knocks wunst on evry mans door
Well fates knockin on your door

Skim listened with a nervous glance toward the doorway Then he shook
his head

All fool fancy ma he remarked Dont ye go an git no rumantic
notions outn books inter yer head

Skim am I a fool er aint I

Taint fer me ter say ma

Fates knockin an if you dont open to it Skim Ill wash my hands
o ye an ye kin jest starve to death

The boy looked disturbed

Whats aggrivatin of ye then he enquired anxiously

A millionaire is come right under yer nose Hes here in Millville
with three gals fer nieces thets all got money to squander ans bound
to hev more

Skim gave a low whistle

Ye dont mean fer me to be courtin at them gals do ye he demanded

Why not Yer famblys jest as respectible as any cept thet yer Uncle
Mell backslided after the last revival an went to a hoss race Yer
young an yer hansome an theres three gals waitin ready to be won
by a bold wooer Be bold Skim take fate by the fetlock an yer
fortuns made easy

Skim did not reply at once He gulped down his tea and stared at the
opposite wall in deep thought It wasnt such a tarnal bad notion
after all and so thoroughly impressed was he with his own importance
and merit that it never occurred to him he would meet with any
difficulties if he chose to undertake the conquest

Peggy says marrige is the mark of a fool an Peggy married money
too he remarked slowly

Pah money Mary Ann Cotting didnt hev but a hundred an forty
dollars all told an she were an old maid an soured an squinteyed
when Peggy hitched up with her

I haint seen nuthin o the world yit continued Skim evasively

Ner ye wont nuther onless ye marry money Any one o them gals could
take ye to Europe an back a dozen times

Skim reflected still farther

Courtin ought to hev some decent clothes he said I kaint set in
the nabobs parlor with all thet slick furnitur in Nick Thornes
castoff Sunday suit

The cloths as good as ever was made an I cut em down myself an
stitched em all over

They dont look like store clothes though objected Skim

The widow sighed

Taint the coat that makes the man Skim

Its the coat thet makes decent courtin though he maintained
stubbornly Gals like to see a feller dressed up It shows he means
business an mounts to somethin

I give Nick Thorne two dollars an a packidge o terbacker fer them
clotlies which the ony thing wrong about was theyd got too snug fer
comfert Nick said so himself But Ill make a bargain with ye Skim Ef
youll agree to give me fifty dollars after yer married Ill buy ye
some store clothes o Sam Cotting to do courtin in

Fifty dollars

Well Ive brung ye up haint I Ive worked like a nigger mindin
shop Say forty dollars I aint small an ef ye git one o them city
gals Skim forty dollars wont mean no moren a wink of an eye to ye

Skim frowned Then he smiled and the smile disclosed a front tooth
missing

Ill dream ont he said Let ye know in the mornin ma But I wont
court a minite mind ye nless I git store clothes



CHAPTER XX

A LOST CAUSE

The boys musings confirmed him in the idea that his mothers scheme was
entirely practical He didnt hanker much to marry being young and
fairly satisfied with his present lot but opportunities like this did
not often occur and it seemed his bounden duty to take advantage of it

He got the store clothes next day together with a scarlet necktie
that was all made up in the latest style as Sam Cotting assured him
and a pair of yellow kid gloves fit fer a howlin swell Skim wasnt
sure at first about the gloves but capitulated when Sam declared they
were real cityfied

In the evening he togged up with his mothers help and then walked
over to the Wegg farm

Beth answered the knock at the door The living room was brightly
lighted Uncle John and the Major were playing checkers in a corner and
Patsy was softly drumming on the piano Louise had a book and Beth had
been engaged upon some fancywork

When the door opened Skim bobbed his head and said

Evenin mom Ive come avisitin

Beth conquered an inclination to smile

Wont you come in she said sweetly

Thankee I will Im Skimbley Clark ye know down t the village Ma
keeps a store there

Im pleased to meet you Mr Clark Allow me to introduce to you my
uncle and cousins said the girl her eyes dancing with amusement

Skim acknowledged the introductions with intense gravity and then sat
down upon a straightbacked chair near the piano this being the end of
the room where the three girls were grouped Uncle John gave a chuckle
and resumed his game with the Major who whispered that he would give a
dollar for an oil painting of Mr Clarkif it couldnt be had for less

Louise laid down her book and regarded the visitor wonderingly Patsy
scented fun and drew a chair nearer the group Beth resumed her
embroidery with a demure smile that made Skim decide at once that he
picked the pretty one

Indeed the decision did justice to his discretion Beth De Graf was a
rarely beautiful girl and quite outshone her cousins in this respect
Louise might be attractive and Patsy fascinating but Beth was the real
beauty of the trio and the most charming trait in her character was her
unconsciousness that she excelled in good looks

So Skim stared hard at Beth and answered the preliminary remarks
addressed to him by Patsy and Louise in a perfunctory manner

Wont you take off your gloves asked Louise soberly Its so warm
this evening you know

The boy looked at his hands

Its sech a tarnal job to git em on agin he replied

Dont put them on then advised Patsy Here in the country we are
allowed to dispense with much unnecessary social etiquette

Air ye Then off they come I aint much stuck on gloves myself but
ma she lowed that a feller goin courtin orter look like a sport

A chorus of wild laughter which greeted this speech had the effect of
making Skim stare at the girls indignantly He couldnt find anything
funny in his remark but there they sat facing him and uttering
hysterical peals of merriment until the tears ran down their cheeks

Silently and with caution he removed the yellow gloves from his hands
and so gave the foolish creatures a chance to laugh out their
blamed giggle

But they were watching him and saw that he was disconcerted They had
no mind to ruin the enjoyment in store for them by offending their
guest so they soon resumed a fitting gravity and began to assist the
youth to forget their rudeness

May I ask said Patsy very graciously which one of us you intend to
favor with your attentions

I aint much used to sech things he replied looking down at his big
hands and growing a little redfaced Praps I hadnt orter tell
before the rest o ye

Oh yes do tell pleaded Louise Were so anxious to know

I dont spose its right clever to pick an choose when yere all by
said Skim regaining confidence But ma she lowed thet with three
gals handy I orter git one on em to say the least

If you got more than one remarked Beth calmly it would be
illegal

Oh ones enough said Skim with a grin Peggy says its too many
an a feller oughtnt to take his gal outn a grabbag

I should think not indeed returned Patsy But here are three of us
openly displayed and unless you turn us all down as unworthy it will
be necessary for you to make a choice

What foolishness are you girls up to now demanded Uncle John
catching a stray word from the other corner while engaged in a desperate
struggle with the Major

This is a time for you to keep quiet Uncle retorted Patsy merrily
Weve got important things to consider that are none of your affairs
whatever

Skim reflected that he didnt want this one except as a last resort
She was too bossy

When I started out he said I jest come acourtin as any feller
might do thet wasnt much acquainted But ef Ive got to settle down to
one o ye

He hesitated

Oh you must really take one at a time you know asserted Louise
Its the only proper way

Then Ill start on thet darkeyed one thets a sewin he said
slowly

Beth looked up from her work and smiled

Go ahead Mr Clark she said encouragingly My name is Beth Had
you forgotten it

Call me Skim he said gently

Very well SkimNow look here Patsy Doyle if youre going to sit
there and giggle youll spoil everything Mr Clark wants to court and
its getting late

Praps Ive went fur enough fer tonight remarked Skim uneasily
Next time theyll leave us alone an then

Oh dont postpone it please begged Beth giving the boy a demure
glance from her soft brown eyes And dont mind my cousins I dont

These things kaint be hurried he said Si Merkle courted three
weeks afore he popped He tol me so

Then he was a very foolish man declared Patsy positively Just look
at Beth Shes dying to have you speak out Whats the use of waiting
when she knows why you are here

By this time Skim had been flattered to the extent of destroying any
stray sense he might ever have possessed His utter ignorance of girls
and their ways may have been partly responsible for his idiocy or his
mothers conviction that all that was necessary was for him to declare
himself in order to be accepted had misled him and induced him to
abandon any native diffidence he might have had Anyway the boy fell
into the snare set by the mischievous young ladies without a suspicion
of his impending fate

Miss Beth said he ef yer willin Ill marry ye any time ye say I
agreed t help Dick Pearson with the harvestin but Ill try to git
Ned Long to take my place an it dont matter much nohow

But I couldnt have you break an engagement cried Beth hastily

Why not

Oh it wouldnt be right at all Mr Pearson would never forgive me
she asserted

Cant ye

No not before harvest Skim I couldnt think of it

But arterward

No Ive resolved never to marry after harvest So as youre engaged
and I dont approve of breaking engagements I must refuse your
proposition entirely

Skim looked surprised then perplexed then annoyed

Praps I didnt pop jest right he murmured growing red again

You popped beautifully declared Patsy But Beth is very peculiar
and set in her ways Im afraid she wouldnt make you a good
wife anyhow

Then praps the gal in blue

No said Louise I have the same prejudices as my cousin If you
hadnt been engaged for the harvest I might have listened to you but
that settles the matter definitely as far as I am concerned

Skim sighed

Mall be mad as a hornet ef I dont get any of ye he remarked sadly
Shes paid Sam Cotting fer this courtin suit an he wont take back
the gloves on no count arter theyve been wore an thetll set ma
crazy Miss Patsy ef yo think ye could

Im sure I couldnt said Patsy promptly Im awfully sorry to break
your heart Skim dear and ruin your future life and make you
misanthropic and cynical and spoil your mothers investment and make
her mad as a hornet All this grieves me terribly but Ill recover from
it if youll only give me time And I hope youll find a wife that will
be more congenial than I could ever be

Skim didnt understand all these words but the general tenor of the
speech was convincing and filled him with dismay

Rich gals is tarnal skeerce in these parts he said regretfully

Then they gave way again and so lusty was the merriment that Uncle John
and the Major abandoned their game and came across the room to discover
the source of all this amusement

Whats up young women asked their Uncle glancing from their
laughing faces to the lowering sullen one of the boy who had only now
begun to suspect that he was being poked fun at

Oh Uncle cried Patsy youve no idea how near you have been to
losing us We have each had an offer of marriage within the last
half hour

Dear me ejaculated Uncle John

It shows the young mans intelligence and good taste said the Major
much amused But is it a Mormon ye are sir to want all three
directing a keen glance at Skim

Naw taint he returned wholly disgusted with the outcome of his
suit All three got ast cause none of ems got sense enough t know
a good thing when they seen it

But I do said the Major stoutly and I maintain that youre a good
thing and always will be I hope sir youll call round and see me in
Baltimore next year Ill not be there but ye can leave your card just
the same

Please call again sir added Uncle John about Octoberjust before
snow flies

The boy got up

I dont keer none he said defiantly Its all mas fault gittin
me laughed at an she wont hear the last of it in a hurry nuther

Be gentle with her Skim suggested Beth softly Remember she has to
face the world with you by her side

Having no retort for this raillery which he felt rather than
understood Skim seized his hat and fled Then Patsy wiped the tears
from her eyes and said

Wasnt it grand girls I havent had so much fun since I was born



CHAPTER XXI

THE TRAP IS SET

Uncle John was forced to acknowledge to his nieces that his boast to
unmask Bob West within three days was mere blustering If he
accomplished anything in three weeks he would consider himself
fortunate But he had no wish to conceal anything from the girls so he
told them frankly of his interview with the hardware merchant and also
what Joe Wegg had said about the stock in the locked cupboard They
were of course greatly interested in this new phase of the matter and
canvassed it long and eagerly

The man is lying of course said Patsy for Captain Wegg and poor
Mr Thompson could not transfer their stock to West after that fatal
night when he brought to them the news of the fire

I believe the stock is still in this cupboard declared Uncle John

Unless West stole the keys and has taken it away suggested Louise

Im sure he did not know about the secret drawer said her uncle
Probably he stole the keys and searched the cupboard if he had found
the stock he would have left the keys which would then be of no further
use to him As he did not find the stock certificates he carried the
keys away that he might search again at his leisure And theyve never
yet been returned

Why John yere possessed of the true detective instinct the Major
remarked admiringly Your reasoning is at once clever and
unassailable

I wonder mused Beth if we could tempt Mr West to come again to
search the cupboard

He will scarcely venture to do that while we are here replied Uncle
John

I said tempt him Uncle

And what did you mean by that expression Beth

Ill think it over and tell you later she returned quietly

                                   

Ethel Thompson would have shown Joe Wegg how much she resented his
leaving Millville without a word to her had she not learned from Mr
Merrick the boys sad condition Knowing her old friend was ill she
determined to ignore the past and go to him at once and Uncle John knew
very well there would be explanations to smooth away all the former
misunderstandings

Joe was now aware of the fact that his letter to Ethel had never reached
its destination so as soon as the girl had arrived and the first
rather formal greetings were over he sent Kate Kebble to McNutts to
ask the agent to come over to the hotel at once

The girl returned alone

Peggy says as he cant come she announced

Why not asked Joe

Says hes jest painted his off foot blue an striped it with red an
it haint dried yit

Go back said Joe firmly Tell Peggy hes in trouble and its
likely to cost him more than a new coat of paint for his foot if he
doesnt come here at once

Kate went back and in due time the stump of McNutts foot was heard on
the stairs He entered the room looking worried and suspicious and the
stern faces of Ethel and Joe did not reassure him by any means But he
tried to disarm the pending accusation with his usual brazen
impertinence

Nice time ter send fer me this is Joe he grumbled Its gittin so
a feller cant even paint his foot in peace an quiet

Peggy said Joe when I went away three years ago I gave you a
letter for Miss Ethel What did you do with it

Peggys bulging eyes stared at his blue foot which he turned first one
side and then the other to examine the red stripes

Its this way Joe he replied there want no postige stamp on the
letter an Sam Cotting said it couldnt be posted no way thout
a stamp

It wasnt to be sent through the postoffice said the boy I gave
you a quarter to deliver it in person to Miss Ethel

Did ye Joe did ye

Of course I did

Curous said McNutt leaning over to touch the foot cautiously with
one finger to see if the paint was dry

Well sir

Well Joe theres no use gittin mad bout it Thet blamed quarter ye
giv me rolled down a crack in the stoop an got lost Sure Got lost as
easy as anything

Well what was that to me

Oh I aint blamin you said Peggy but twere a good deal to me I
kin tell ye A whole quarter lost

Why didnt you take up a board and get it again

Oh I did said McNutt cheerfully I did Joe But the money was all
black an tarnished like by thet time an didnt look at all like
silver Sam he wouldnt take it at the store so my ol woman she lowed
shed polish it up a bit Ye know how sort o vigrous she is Joe She
polished that blamed quarter the same way she jaws an sweeps she
polished it til she rubbed both sides smooth as glass an then Sam
wouldnt take it nuther n said it wasnt money any more So I
drilled two holes in it an sewed it on my pants fer a spender buttn

But why didnt you deliver the letter

Did ye spect Id tramp way t Thompsons Crossing fer nuthin

I gave you a quarter

An it turned out to be ony a spender buttn Be reasonble Joe

Where is the letter

Taint a letter no more Its ony ol fambly papers by this time
Three years is

Where is it By thunder Peggy if you dont answer me Ill put you in
jail for breach of trust

Yeve changed Joe sadly Ye aint no more like

Where is it

Behind the lookinglass in my settnroom

Go and get it immediately sir

Ef I hev to cross thet dusty road twict more Ill hev to paint all
over agin an thets a fact

Ethel said Joe with the calmness of despair youll have to
telephone over to the Junction and ask them to send a constable here
at once

Never mind cried McNutt jumping up hastily Ill go Paint dont
cost much nohow

He stumped away but on his return preferred to let Kate carry the
soiled torn envelope up to the young folks The letter had palpably
been tampered with It had been opened and doubtless read and the flap
clumsily glued down again

But Ethel had it now and even after three years her sweet eyes dimmed
as she read the tender words that Joe had written because he lacked the
courage to speak them My one great ambition is to win a home for us
dear he had declared and with this before her eyes Ethel reproached
herself for ever doubting his love or loyalty

When she rode her pony over to the Wegg farm next day Ethels bright
face was wreathed with smiles She told her girl friends that she and
Joe had had a good talk together and understood each other better
than ever before The nieces did not tell her of their newly conceived
hopes that the young couple would presently possess enough money to
render their future comfortable because there were so many chances that
Bob West might win the little game being played But at this moment
Ethel did not need worldly wealth to make her heart light and happy for
she had regained her childhoods friend and his injuries only rendered
the boy the more interesting and companionable

Meantime Uncle John had been busily thinking It annoyed him to be so
composedly defied by a rascally country merchant and he resolved if he
must fight to fight with all his might

So he wired to his agent in New York the following words

What part of the Almaquo timber tract burned in forest fire three years
ago

The answer he received made him give a satisfied grunt

No forest fires near Almaquo three years ago Almadona seventy miles
north burned at that time and newspaper reports confounded the names

Very good exclaimed Uncle John Ive got the rascal now

He issued instructions to the lumber company to make no further payments
of royalties to Robert West until otherwise advised and this had the
effect of bringing West to the farm white with rage

What do you mean by this action Mr Merrick he demanded

Weve been paying you money that does not belong to you for three
years sir was the reply In a few days when my investigations are
complete I will give you the option of being arrested for embezzlement
of funds belonging to Joseph Wegg and the Thompsons or restoring to
them every penny of their money

West stared

You are carrying matters with a high hand sir he sneered

Oh no I am acting very leniently said Uncle John

Neither Joe nor the Thompsons own a dollars interest in the Almaquo
property It is all mine and mine alone

Then produce the stock and prove it retorted Mr Merrick
triumphantly

At that moment Louise interrupted the interview by entering the room
suddenly

Oh Uncle said she will you join us in a picnic to the Falls
tomorrow afternoon We are all going

Then I wont be left behind he replied smiling upon her

We shall take even Thomas and Nora and come home late in the evening
by moonlight

That suits me my dear said he

West stood silent and scowling but as the girl tripped away she saw him
raise his eyes and glance slyly toward the cupboard for they were in
the right wing room

Mr Merrick he resumed in a harsh voice I warn you that if your
company holds up the payment of my royalties it will break the contract
and I will forbid them to cut another tree You are doubtless aware that
there are a dozen firms willing to take your place and pay me higher
royalties

Act as you please sir said Uncle John indifferently I believe you
are face to face with ruin and it wont matter much what you do

West went away more quietly than he had come and the girls exclaimed
delightedly

The trap is set Uncle

I think so myself he rejoined That picnic was a happy thought
Louise

Early the next afternoon they started out with hammocks and baskets and
all the paraphernalia of a picnic party The three girls Nora and Uncle
John squeezed themselves into the surrey while the Major and Old Hucks
rode after them in the ancient buggy with Dan moaning and groaning
every step he took But the old horse moved more briskly when following
Joe and Hucks could get more speed out of him than anyone else so he
did not lag much behind

The procession entered Millville where a brief stop was made at the
store and then made its exit by the north road West was standing in
the door of his hardware store quietly observing them When they
disappeared in the grove he locked the door of his establishment and
sauntered in the direction of the Pearson farm no one noticing him
except Peggy McNutt who was disappointed because he had intended to go
over presently and buy a paper of tacks

When the village was left behind Uncle John drove swiftly along
following the curve of the lake until he reached a primitive lane that
he had discovered formed a short cut directly back to the Wegg farm Old
Thomas was amazed by this queer action on the part of the picnic party
but aside from blind Nora who had no idea where they were the others
seemed full of repressed eagerness and in no way surprised

The lane proved very rocky though and they were obliged to jolt slowly
over the big cobble stones So Beth and Patsy leaped out of the surrey
and the former called out

We will run through the forest Uncle and get home as soon as you do

Be careful not to show yourselves then he replied Remember our
plans

We will And dont forget to tie the horses in the thicket and warn
Thomas and Nora to keep quiet until we come for them said Patsy

Ill attend to all that dear remarked Louise composedly But if
you girls are determined to walk you must hurry along or you will keep
us waiting

The nieces had explored every path in the neighborhood by this time so
Beth and Patsy were quite at home in the pine forest The horses started
up again and after struggling along another quarter of a mile a wheel
of the surrey dished between two stones and with a bump the axle struck
the ground and the journey was promptly arrested

What shall we do now asked Uncle John much annoyed as the party
alighted to examine the wreck

Send Thomas back to the village for another wheel suggested the Major

Not today cried Louise We mustnt appear in the village again this
afternoon on any account It is absolutely necessary we should keep out
of sight

True agreed Uncle John promptly Thomas and Nora must picnic here
all by themselves until nearly midnight Then they may drive the buggy
home leading Daniel behind them It will be time enough tomorrow to get
a new buggy wheel and the broken surrey wont be in anybodys way until
we send for it

If Old Hucks thought they had all gone crazy that day he was seemingly
justified in the suspicion for his master left the baskets of good
things to be consumed by himself and Nora and started to walk to the
farm the Major and Louise accompanying him

We mustnt loiter said the girl for while West may wait until
darkness falls to visit the farm he is equally liable to arrive at any
time this afternoon He has seen us all depart and believes the house
deserted

But they were obliged to keep to the lane where walking was difficult
and meantime Patsy and Beth were tripping easily along their woodland
paths and making much better progress



CHAPTER XXII

CAUGHT

Were early said Beth as they came to the edge of the woods and
sighted the farm house but that is better than being late

Then she stopped suddenly with a low cry and pointed to the right wing
which directly faced them Bob West turned the corner of the house
tried the door of Uncle Johns room and then walked to one of the
French windows The sash was not fastened so he deliberately opened it
and stepped inside

What shall we do gasped Patsy clasping her hands excitedly

Beth was always cool in an emergency

You creep up to the window dear and wait till you hear me open the
inside door said she Ill run through the house and enter from the
livingroom The key is under the mat you know

But what can we do Oughtnt we to wait until Uncle John and father
come Patsy asked in a trembling voice

Of course not West might rob the cupboard and be gone by that time
Weve got to act promptly Patsy so dont be afraid

Without further words Beth ran around the back of the house and
disappeared while Patsy trying to control the beating of her heart
stole softly over the lawn to the open window of Uncle Johns room

She could not help looking in at the risk of discovery Bob Westtall
lean and composed as everwas standing beside the cupboard the doors
of which were wide open The outer doors were of wood panelled and
carved the inner ones were plates of heavy steel and in the lock that
secured these latter doors were the keys that had so long been missing
Both were attached to a slender silver chain

As Patsy peered in at the man West was engaged in deliberately examining
packet after packet of papers evidently striving to find the missing
stock certificates He was in no hurry believing he would have the
house to himself for several hours so he tumbled Captain Weggs
souvenirs of foreign lands in a heap on the floor beside him thrusting
his hand into every corner of the cupboard in order that the search
might be thorough He had once before examined the place in vain this
time he intended to succeed

Presently West drew a cigar from his pocket lighted it and was about
to throw the match upon the floor when the thought that it might later
betray his presence made him pause and then walk to the open window As
he approached Patsy became panicstricken and well knowing that she
ought to run or hide stood rooted to the spot gazing half appealingly
and half defiantly into the startled eyes of the man who suddenly
confronted her

So for a moment they stood motionless West was thinking rapidly By
some error be had miscounted the picnic party and this girl had been
left at home She had discovered his intrusion had seen him at the
cupboard and would report the matter to John Merrick This being the
case it would do him no good to retreat without accomplishing his
purpose If once he secured the stock certificates he could afford to
laugh at his accusers and secure them he must while he had the
opportunity

So clearly did these thoughts follow one another that Wests hesitation
seemed only momentary Without a word to the girl he tossed the match
upon the grass calmly turned his back and started for the
cupboard again

But here a new surprise awaited him Brief as had been his absence
another girl had entered the room Beth opened the door even as West
turned toward the window and taking in the situation at a glance she
tiptoed swiftly to the cupboard withdrew the keys from the lock and
dropped them noiselessly into a widemouthed vase that stood on the
table and was partially filled with flowers The next instant West
turned and saw her but she smiled at him triumphantly Good afternoon
sir said the girl sweetly can I do anything to assist you

West uttered an impatient exclamation and regarded Beth savagely

Is the house full of girls he demanded

Oh no Patsy and I are quite alone she replied with a laugh Come
in Patsy dear and help me to entertain our guest she added

Patsy came through the window and stood beside her cousin The man
stared at them bit his lip and then turned again to the cupboard If
he noted the absence of the keys he did not remark upon the fact but
with hurried yet thorough examination began anew to turn over the
bundles of papers

Beth sat down and watched him but Patsy remained standing behind her
chair West emptied all the shelves and then after a pause took out his
pocket knife and began tapping with its end the steel sides of the
cupboard There was no doubt he suspected the existence of a secret
aperture and Beth began to feel uneasy

Slowly the man worked his way downward from shelf to shelf and began
to sound the bottom plates wholly oblivious of the fascinated gaze of
the two young girls Then a sudden gruff ejaculation startled them all
and West swung around to find a new group of watchers outside the
window In the foreground appeared the stern face of John Merrick

The scene was intensely dramatic to all but the singular man who had
been battling to retain a fortune West knew in an instant that his
attempt to secure the certificates was a failure He turned from the
cupboard dusted his hands and nodded gravely to the last arrivals

Come in Mr Merrick said he seating himself in a chair and removing
his hat which he had been wearing I owe you an apology for intruding
upon your premises in your absence

Uncle John strode into the room angry and indignant at the fellows cool
impertinence The Major and Louise followed and all eyes centered upon
the face of Bob West

The contents of this cupboard remarked the hardware merchant calmly
belong to the estate of Captain Wegg and can scarcely be claimed by
you because you have purchased the house You falsely accused me the
other day sir and I have been searching for proof that the Almaquo
Timber Tract stock is entirely my property

Have you found such proof inquired Mr Merrick

Not yet

And you say the stock was all issued to you

West hesitated

It was all transferred to me by Captain Wegg and Will Thompson

Does the transfer appear upon the stock itself

Of course sir

In that case said Uncle John I shall be obliged to ask your pardon
But the fact can be easily proved

He walked to the open cupboard felt for the slide Joe had described to
him and drew it forward A small drawer was behind the orifice and
from this Mr Merrick drew a packet of papers

West gave a start and half arose Then he settled back into his chair
again

Hm This appears to be the stock in question said Uncle John He
drew a chair to the table unfolded the documents and examined them with
deliberate care

The nieces watched his face curiously Mr Merrick first frowned then
turned red and finally a stern determined look settled upon his
rugged features

Take your stock Mr West he said tossing it toward the man and
try to forgive us for making fools of ourselves



CHAPTER XXIII

MR WEST EXPLAINS

A cry of amazed protest burst from the girls The Major whistled softly
and walked to the window

I find the stock properly transferred continued Uncle John grimly
conscious that he was as thoroughly disappointed as the girls It is
signed by both Wegg and Thompson and witnessed in the presence of a
notary I congratulate you Mr West You have acquired a fortune

But not recently replied the hardware dealer enjoying the confusion
of his recent opponents I have owned this stock for more than three
years and you will see by the amount endorsed upon it that I paid a
liberal price for it under the circumstances

Uncle John gave a start and a shrewd look

Of course you did said he On paper

I have records to prove that both Captain Wegg and Will Thompson
received their money said West quietly I see it is hard for you to
abandon the idea that I am a rogue

There could be no adequate reply to this so for a time all sat in moody
silence But the thoughts of some were busy

I would like Mr West to explain what became of the money he paid for
this stock said Louise adding That is if he will be so courteous

West did not answer for a moment Then he said with a gesture of
indifference

I am willing to tell all I know But you people must admit that the
annoyances you have caused me during the past fortnight to say nothing
of the gratuitous insults heaped upon my head render me little inclined
to favor you

You are quite justified in feeling as you do replied Uncle John
meekly I have been an ass West but circumstances warranted me in
suspecting you and even Joseph Wegg did not know that the Almaquo stock
had been transferred to you He merely glanced at it at the time of his
fathers death without noticing the endorsement and thought the fire
had rendered it worthless But if you then owned the stock why was it
not in your possession

That was due to my carelessness was the reply The only notary
around here is at Hookers Falls and Mr Thompson offered to have him
come to Captain Weggs residence and witness the transfer As my
presence was not necessary for this and I had full confidence in my
friends integrity I paid them their money which they were eager to
secure at once and said I would call in a few days for the stock I did
call and was told the notary had been here and the transfer had been
legally made Wegg said he would get the stock from the cupboard and
hand it to me but we both forgot it at that time After his death I
could not find it for it was in the secret drawer

Another thing sir said Uncle John If neither Wegg nor Thompson was
then interested in the Almaquo property why did the news of its
destruction by fire shock them so greatly that the result was Captain
Weggs death

I see it will be necessary for me to explain to you more fully
returned West with a thoughtful look It is evident Mr Merrick from
your questions that some of these occurrences seem suspicious to a
stranger and perhaps you are not so much to be blamed as in my
annoyance and indignation I have imagined

I would like the matter cleared up for the sake of Ethel and Joe said
Mr Merrick simply

And so would I declared the hardware dealer You must know sir
that Will Thompson was the one who first led Captain Wegg into investing
his money I think the Captain did it merely to please Will for at that
time he had become so indifferent to worldly affairs that he took no
interest in anything beyond a mild wish to provide for his sons future
But Thompson was erratic in judgment so Wegg used to bring their
matters to me to decide upon I always advised them as honestly as I was
able At the time I secured an option on the Almaquo tract and wanted
them to join me Will Thompson had found another lot of timber but
located in an outoftheway corner which he urged the Captain to join
him in buying Wegg brought the matter to me as usual and I pointed
out that my proposed contract with the PierceLane Lumber Company would
assure our making a handsome profit at Almaquo while Thompson had no
one in view to cut the other tract Indeed it was far away from any
railroad Wegg saw the force of my argument and insisted that Thompson
abandon his idea and accept my proposition Together we bought the
property having formed a stock company and the contract for cutting
the timber was also secured Things were looking bright for us and
royalty payments would soon be coming in

Then to my amazement Wegg came to me and wanted to sell out their
interests He said Thompson had always been dissatisfied because they
had not bought the other tract of timber and that the worry and
disappointment was affecting his friends mind He was personally
satisfied that my investment was the best but in order to sooth old
Will and prevent his mind from giving way Wegg wanted to withdraw and
purchase the other tract

I knew there was a fortune in Almaquo so I went to New York and
mortgaged all I possessed discounting a lot of notes given me by
farmers in payment for machinery and finally borrowing at a high rate
of interest the rest of the money I needed In other words I risked all
my fortune on Almaquo and brought the money home to pay Wegg and
Thompson for their interest The moment they received the payment they
invested it in the Bogue tract

Hold on cried Uncle John What tract did you say

The Bogue timber tract sir It lies

I know where it lies Our company has been a whole year trying to find
out who owned it

Wegg and Thompson bought it I was angry at the time because their
withdrawal had driven me into a tight corner to protect my investment
and I told them they would bitterly regret their action I think Wegg
agreed with me but Will Thompson was still stubborn

Then came the news of the fire at Almaquo It was a false report I
afterward learned but at that time I believed the newspapers and the
blow almost deprived me of reason In my excitement I rushed over to
Weggs farm and found the two men together whereupon I told them I
was ruined

The news affected them powerfully because they had just saved
themselves from a like ruin they thought Wegg was also a sympathetic
man in spite of his reserve His old heart trouble suddenly came upon
him aggravated by the excitement of the hour and he died with scarcely
a moan Thompson whose reason was tottering long before this became
violently insane at witnessing his friends death and has never since
recovered That is all I am able to tell you sir

The Bogue tract said Uncle John slowly is worth far more than the
Almaquo Old Will Thompson was sane enough when insisting on that
investment But where is the stock or deed to show they bought that
property

I do not know sir I only know they told me they had effected the
purchase

Pardon me said the Major Have you not been through this cupboard
before

West looked at him with a frown

Yes in a search for my own stock he said But I found neither that
nor any deed to the Bogue property I am not a thief Major Doyle

You stole the keys though said Louise pointedly

I did not even do that said West On the day of the funeral Joe
carelessly left them lying upon a table so I slipped them into my
pocket When I thought of them again Joe had gone away and I did not
know his address I came over and searched the cupboard unsuccessfully
But it was not a matter of great importance at that time if the stock
was mislaid since there was no one to contest my ownership of it It
was only after Mr Merrick accused me of robbing my old friends and
ordered my payments stopped that I realized it was important to me to
prove my ownership That is why I came here today

Again a silence fell upon the group Said Uncle John finally

If the deed to the Bogue tract can be found Joe and Ethel will be
rich I wonder what became of the paper

No one answered for here was another mystery



CHAPTER XXIV

PEGGY HAS REVENGE

Joe Wegg made a rapid recovery his strength returning under the
influence of pleasant surroundings and frequent visits from Ethel and
Uncle Johns three nieces Not a word was hinted to either the invalid
or the school teacher regarding the inquiries Mr Merrick was making
about the deed to the Bogue timber lands which if found would make
the young couple independent Joe was planning to exploit a new patent
as soon as he could earn enough to get it introduced and Ethel
exhibited a sublime confidence in the boys ability that rendered all
question of money insignificant

Joes sudden appearance in the land of his birth and his generally
smashed up condition were a nine days wonder in Millville The gossips
wanted to know all the whys and wherefores but the boy kept his room in
the hotel or only walked out when accompanied by Ethel or one of the
three nieces Sometimes they took him to ride as he grew better and
the fact that Joe were hand an glove wi the nabobs lent him a
distinction he had never before possessed

McNutt always busy over somebody elses affairs was very curious to
know what had caused the accident Joe had suffered Notwithstanding the
little affair of the letter in which he had not appeared with especial
credit Peggy made an effort to interview the young man that resulted in
his complete discomfiture But that did not deter him from indulging in
various vivid speculations about Joe Wegg which the simple villagers
listened to with attention For one thing he confided to the boys at
the store that in his opinion the man who had murdered Capn Wegg had
tried to murder his son also and it wasnt likely Joe could manage to
escape him a second time Another tale evolved from Peggys fertile
imagination was that Joe being about to starve to death in the city
had turned burglar and been shot in the arm in an attempt at
housebreaking

Wouldnt be sprised said the agent in an awed voice ef the plice
was on his track now Praps theres a reward offered boys lets keep
an eye on him

He waylaid the nieces once or twice and tried to secure from them a
verification of his somber suspicions which they mischievously
fostered

The girls found him a source of much amusement and relieved their own
disappointment at finding the Wegg Mystery a pricked bubble by getting
McNutt excited over many sly suggestions of hidden crimes They knew he
was harmless for even his neighbors needed proof of any assertion he
made moreover the investigation Uncle John was making would soon set
matters right so the young ladies did not hesitate to have fun at the
little agents expense

One of McNutts numerous occupations was raising a patch of
watermelons each year on the lot back of the house These he had
fostered with great care since the plants had first sprouted through the
soil and in these late August days two or three hundreds of fine big
melons were just getting ripe He showed the patch with much pride one
day to the nieces saying

Heres the most extryfine mellingpatch in this county ef I do say it
myself Dan Brayley he thinks he kin raise mellings but the ol fool
aint got a circumstance to this Aint they beauties

It seems to me observed Patsy gravely that Brayleys are just as
good We passed his place this morning and wondered how he could raise
such enormous melons

Normous Brayleys

Im sure they are finer than these said Beth

Well Ill be jiggered Peggys eyes stared as they had never stared
before Dan Brayley hes a miserble ol skinflint Thet man couldnt
raise decent mellings ef he tried

What do you charge for melons Mr McNutt inquired Louise

Charge Whyerfifty cents a piece is my price to nabobs an dirt
cheap at that

That is too much declared Patsy Mr Brayley says he will sell his
melons for fifteen cents each

Him Fifteen cents gasped Peggy greatly disappointed Say
Brayleys a disturbin element in these parts He oughter go to jail fer
asking fifteen cents fer them mean little mellings o hisn

They seem as large as yours murmured Louise

But they aint An Brayleys a cheat an a rascal while a honester
man ner me dont breathe Nobody likes Brayley round Millville Why
ony las winter he called me a meddlerin publican said as I shot
off my mouth too much Me

How impolite

But thats Dan Brayley My mellings at fifty cents is better n hisn
at fifteen

Tell me said Patsy with a smile did you ever rob a melonpatch
Mr McNutt

Me I dont hev to I grow em

But the ones you grow are worth fifty cents each are they not

Sure mine is

Then every time you eat one of your own melons you eat fifty cents If
you were eating one of Mr Brayleys melons you would only eat
fifteen cents

And it would be Brayleys fifteen cents too added Beth quickly

Peggy turned his protruding eyes from one to the other and a smile
slowly spread over his features

By jinks lets rob Brayleys mellingpatch he cried

All right well help you answered Patsy readily

Oh my dear remonstrated Louise not understanding

It will be such fun replied her cousin with eyes dancing merrily
Boys always rob melonpatches so I dont see why girls shouldnt When
shall we do it Mr McNutt

There aint any moon jest now an the nights is dark as blazes Lets
go ternight

Its a bargain declared Patsy We will come for you in the surrey at
ten oclock and all drive together to the back of Brayleys yard and
take all the melons we want

Itll serve him right said Peggy delightedly Ol Dan called me a
meddler onctin publican Im bound t git even with him

Dont betray us sir pleaded Beth

I cant replied McNutt frankly Im in it myself an well jest
find out what his blametwisted ol fifteencent mellings is like

Patsy was overjoyed at the success of her plot which she had conceived
on the spur of the moment as most clever plots are conceived On the
way home she confided to her cousins a method of securing revenge upon
the agent for selling them the three copies of the Lives of
the Saints

McNutt wants to get even with Brayley he says and we want to get even
with McNutt I think our chances are best dont you she asked

And they decided to join the conspiracy

There was some difficulty escaping from Uncle John and the Major that
night but Patsy got them interested in a game of chess that was likely
to last some hours while Beth stole to the barn and harnessed Joe to
the surrey Soon the others slipped out and joined her and with Patsy
and Beth on the front seat and Louise Inside the canopy they drove
slowly away until the sound of the horses feet on the stones was no
longer likely to betray them

McNutt was waiting for them when they quietly drew up before his house
The village was dark and silent for its inhabitants retired early to
bed By good fortune the sky was overcast with heavy clouds and not even
the glimmer of a star relieved the gloom

They put McNutt on the back seat with Louise cautioned him to be quiet
and then drove away Dan Brayleys place was two miles distant but in
answer to Peggys earnest inquiry if she knew the way Beth declared she
could find it blindfolded In a few moments Louise had engaged the
agent in a spirited discussion of the absorbing mystery and so
occupied his attention that he paid no heed to the direction they had
taken The back seat was hemmed in by side curtains and the canopy so
it would be no wonder if he lost all sense of direction even had not
the remarks of the girl at his side completely absorbed him

Beth drove slowly down the main street up a lane back by the lake road
and along the street again and this programme was repeated several
times until she thought a sufficient distance had been covered to
convince the agent they had arrived at Brayleys They way was pitch
dark but the horse was sensible enough to keep in the middle of the
road so they met with no accident more than to jolt over a stone
now and then

But now the most difficult part of the enterprise lay before them The
girls turned down the lane back of the main street and bumped over the
ruts until they thought they had arrived at a spot opposite McNutts own
melon patch

Whats wrong asked the agent as they suddenly stopped with a jerk

This ought to be Brayleys said Beth but its so dark Im not
certain just where we are

McNutt thrust his head out and peered into the blackness

Drive along a little he whispered

The girl obeyed

Stopstop said he a moment later I think thats them contwisted
fifteencent mellingsover there

They all got out and Beth tied the horse to the fence Peggy climbed
over and at once whispered

Come on Its them all right

Through the drifting clouds there was just enough light to enable them
to perceive the dark forms of the melons lying side by side upon their
vines The agent took out his big clasp knife and recklessly slashed one
of them open

Greens grass he grumbled and slashed another

Patsy giggled and the others felt a sudden irresistible impulse to join
her

Keep still cautioned McNutt Wouldnt ol Dan be jest ravin ef he
knew this Sayheres a ripe one Hev a slice

They all felt for the slices he offered and ate the fruit without being
able to see it But it really tasted delicious

As the girls feasted they heard a crunching sound and inquired in low
voices what it was

McNutt was stumping over the patch and plumping his wooden foot into
every melon he could find smashing them wantonly against the ground
The discovery filled them with horror They had thought inducing the
agent to rob his own patch of a few melons while under the delusion
that they belonged to his enemy Brayley a bit of harmless fun but here
was the vindictive fellow actually destroying his own property by the
wholesale

Oh dont Please dont Mr McNutt pleaded Patsy in frightened
accents

Yes I will declared the agent stubbornly Ill git even with Dan
Brayley fer once in my life ef I never do another thing by gum

But its wrongits wicked protested Beth

Cant help it this is my chance an Ill make them bum fifteencent
mellings look like a penny a piece afore I gits done with em

Never mind girls whispered Louise Its the law of retribution
Poor Peggy will be sorry for this tomorrow

The man had not the faintest suspicion where he was He knew his own
melon patch well enough having worked in it at times all the summer
but he had never climbed over the fence and approached it from the rear
before so it took on a new aspect to him from this point of view and
moreover the night was dark enough to deceive anybody

If he came across an especially big melon McNutt would lug it to the
carriage and dump it in And so angry and energetic was the little man
that in a brief space the melon patch was a scene of awful devastation
and the surrey contained all the fruit that survived the massacre

Beth unhitched the horse and they all took their places in the carriage
again having some difficulty to find places for their feet on account
of the cargo of melons McNutt was stowed away inside with Louise and
they drove away up the lane The agent was jubilant and triumphant and
chuckled in gleeful tones that thrilled the girls with remorse as they
remembered the annihilation of McNutts cherished melons

Ol Dan usully has a dorg said Peggy between his fits of laughter
but I guess he had him chained up ternight

Im not positively sure that was Brayleys place remarked Beth its
so very dark

Oh it were Brayleys all right McNutt retorted I could tell by
the secondclass taste o them mellings an their measley little size
Them things aint a circumstance to the kind I raise

Are you sure asked Louise

Sures shootln Guess Im a jedge o mellings when I sees em

No one could see tonight said Beth

Feelins jest the same declared the little man confidently

After wandering around a sufficient length of time to allay suspicion
Beth finally drew up before McNutts house again

Ill jest take my share o them mellings said Peggy as he alighted
They aint much count bein Brayleys but itll save me an the ol
woman from eatin our own or perhaps I kin sell em to Sam Cotting

He took rather more than his share of the spoils but the girls had no
voice to object They were by this time so convulsed with suppressed
merriment that they had hard work not to shriek aloud their laughter
For in spite of the tragic revelations the morrow would bring forth
the situation was so undeniably ridiculous that they could not resist
its humor

Ive had a heap o fun whispered McNutt Good night gals Ef ye
didnt belong to thet gumtwisted nabob yed be some punkins

Thank you Mr McNutt Good night

And it was not until well on their journey to the farm that the girls
finally dared to abandon further restraint Then indeed they made the
grim black hills of the plateau resound to the peals of their
merry laughter



CHAPTER XXV

GOOD NEWS AT LAST

It was on the morning following this adventure that Uncle John received
a bulky envelope from the city containing the result of the
investigation he had ordered regarding the ownership of the Bogue tract
of pine forest It appeared that the company in which he was so largely
interested had found the tract very valuable and had been seeking for
the owners in order to purchase it or lease the right to cut the timber
But although they had traced it through the hands of several successive
owners the present holders were all unknown to them until Mr Merricks
information had furnished them with a clue A year ago the company had
paid up the back taxestwo years overduein order to establish a claim
to the property and now they easily succeeded in finding the record of
the deed from a certain Charles Walton to Jonas Wegg and William
Thompson The deed itself could not be found but Uncle John considered
the county record a sufficient claim to entitle the young folks to the
property unless the ownership should be contested by others which was
not likely

Uncle John invited Ethel and Joe to dine with him that evening and Mary
was told the occasion merited the best menu she could provide The young
folks arrived without any idea of receiving more than a good dinner and
the pleasure of mingling with the cordial kindly household at the farm
but the general air of hilarity and good fellowship pervading the family
circle this evening inspired the guests with like enthusiasm and no
party could be merrier than the one that did full justice to Marys
superior cookery

One of the last courses consisted of iced watermelon and when it
appeared the three girls eyed one another guiltily and then made frantic
attempts to suppress their laughter which was unseemly because no one
but themselves understood the joke But all else was speedily forgotten
in the interest of the coming ceremony which Mr Merrick had carefully
planned and prepared

The company was invited to assemble in the room comprising the spacious
right wing and when all were seated the little gentleman coughed to
clear his throat and straightway began his preamble

He recited the manner in which Captain Wegg and Will Thompson having
money to invest were led into an enterprise which Bob West had
proposed but finally preferred another venture and so withdrew their
money altogether from the Almaquo tract

This statement caused both Joe and Ethel to stare hard but they said
nothing

Your grandfather Ethel continued the narrator was much impressed
by the value of another timber tract although where he got his
information concerning it I have been unable to discover This piece of
property called the Bogue tract was purchased by Wegg and Thompson
with the money they withdrew from Almaquo and still stands in
their name

Then he recounted quite frankly his unjust suspicions of the hardware
dealer and told of the interview in which the full details of this
transaction were disclosed by West as well as the truth relating to the
death of Captain Wegg and the sudden insanity and paralysis of old
Will Thompson

Joe could corroborate this last and now understood why Thompson had
cried out that Wests good news had killed his father He meant of
course their narrow escape from being involved in Wests supposed ruin
for at that time no one knew the report of the fire was false

Finally these matters being cleared up Uncle John declared that the
PierceLane Lumber Company was willing to contract to cut the timber on
the Bogue property or would pay a lump sum of two hundred thousand
dollars for such title to the tract as could be given He did not add
that he had personally offered to guarantee the title That was an
unnecessary bit of information

You may perhaps imagine the happiness this announcement gave Joe and
Ethel They could scarcely believe the good news was true even when the
kindly old gentleman with tears in his eyes congratulated the young
couple on the fortune in store for them The Major followed with a happy
speech of felicitation and then the three girls hugged the little
school teacher rapturously and told her how glad they were

I think sir said Joe striving to curb his elation that it will be
better in the end for us to accept the royalty Dont you

I do indeed my boy was the reply For if our people make an offer
for the land of two hundred thousand you may rest assured it is worth
much more The manager has confided to me in his letter that if we are
obliged to pay royalties the timber will cost us nearly double what it
would by an outright purchase of the tract

In that case sir began Joe eagerly we will

Nonsense The company can afford the royalty Joe for it is making a
heap of moneymore than I wish it were One of my greatest trials is to
take care of the money Ive already made and

And he couldnt do it at all without my help broke in the Major
Dont ye hesitate to take an advantage of him Joseph if ye can get
itwhich I doubtfor Mr Merrick is most disgracefully rich already

Thats true sighed the little millionaire So it will be a royalty
Joe We are paying the same percentage to Bob West for the Almaquo
tract but yours is so much better that I am sure your earnings will
furnish you and Ethel with all the income you need

They sat discoursing upon the happy event for some time longer but Joe
had to return to the hotel early because he was not yet strong enough to
be out late

Before I go Mr Merrick he said Id like you to give me my
mothers picture which is in the secret drawer of the cupboard You
have the keys now and Ethel is curious to see how my mother looked

Uncle John went at once to the cupboard and unlocked the doors Joe
himself pushed the slide and took out of the drawer the picture which
had lain just beneath the Almaquo stock certificates

The picture was passed reverently around A sweetfaced sad little
woman it showed with appealing eyes and lips that seemed to quiver even
in the photograph

As Louise held it in her hand something induced her to turn it over

Here is some writing upon the back she said

Joe bent over and read it aloud It was in his fathers handwriting

Press the spring in the left hand lower corner of the secret drawer

Hah cried Uncle John while the others stared stupidly Thats it
Thats the information weve been wanting so long Joseph

He ran to the cupboard even as he spoke and while they all thronged
about him thrust in his hand felt for the spring and pressed it

The bottom of the drawer lifted showing another cavity beneath From
this the searcher withdrew a long envelope tied with red tape

At last Joseph he shouted triumphantly waving the envelope over his
head And then he read aloud the words docketed upon the outside
Warranty Deed and Conveyance from Charles Walton to Jonas Wegg and
William Thompson Our troubles are over my boy for here is the key to
your fortune

Also whispered Louise to her cousins rather disconsolately it
explains the last shred of mystery about the Wegg case Heighho what a
chase weve had for nothing

Not for nothing dear replied Patsy softly for weve helped make
two people happy and that ought to repay us for all our anxiety
and labor

                                   

A knock was heard at the door and Old Hucks entered and handed Mr
Merrick a paper

Hes waiting sir said he ambiguously

Oh TomTom cried Joe Wegg rising to throw his arms around the old
mans neck Im rich Tomall my troubles are overand Mr Merrick
has done it allfor Ethel and me

The ever smiling face of the ancient retainer did not change but his
eyes softened and filled with tears as he hugged the boy close to
his breast

God be praised Joe he said in a low voice I allus knew the
Merricks d bring us luck

What the devil does this mean demanded Uncle John at this juncture
as he fluttered the paper and glared angrily around

What is it dear inquired Louise

See for yourself he returned

She took the paper and read it while Patsy and Beth peered over her
shoulder The following was scrawled upon a sheet of soiled stationery


John Merrak esquare to
  Marshall McMahon McNutt detter

To yur gals Smashin  mellings at  cents a one
  
    Pleas remitt  save trouble

The nieces screamed laughing until they cried while Uncle John
spluttered smiled beamed and then requested an explanation

Patsy told the story of the watermelon raid with rare humor and it
served to amuse everybody and relieve the strain that had preceded the
arrival of McNutts bill

Did you say the man is waiting Thomas asked Uncle John

Yes sir

Heregive him five dollars and tell him to receipt the bill If he
refuses Ill carry the matter to the courts McNutts a rascal and a
fool in the bargain but weve had some of his melons and the girls have
had five dollars worth of fun in getting them But assure him that this
squares accounts Thomas

Thomas performed his mission

McNutt rolled his eyes pounded the floor with his stump to emphasize
his mingled anger and satisfaction and then receipted the bill

Its jest five moren I spected to git Hucks he said with a grin
But whats the use o havin nabobs around ef ye dont bleed em

Section   Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment  Many small donations
 to  are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all  states of the United
States  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States  US laws alone swamp our small staff

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks online payments and credit card
donations  To donate please visit httppglaforgdonate


Section   General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone  For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support

Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included  Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBooks
eBook number often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII
compressed zipped HTML and others

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number  The replaced older file is renamed
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility

httpwwwgutenbergnet

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenbergtm
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks

EBooks posted prior to November  with eBook numbers BELOW 
are filed in directories based on their release date  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year

httpwwwibiblioorggutenbergetext

    Or etext       
              or 

EBooks posted since November  with etext numbers OVER  are
filed in a different way  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path  The path is based on the etext number which is
identical to the filename  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename  For
example an eBook of filename  would be found at

httpwwwgutenbergnet

or filename  would be found at
httpwwwgutenbergnet
