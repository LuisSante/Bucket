  ARTEMIS TO ACTAEON


  THOU couldst not look on me and live so runs
  The mortal legendthou that couldst not live
  Nor look on me so the divine decree
  That sawst me in the cloud the wave the bough
  The clod commoved with April and the shapes
  Lurking twixt lid and eyeball in the dark
  Mocked I thee not in every guise of life
  Hid in girls eyes a naiad in her well
  Wooed through their laughter and like echo fled
  Luring thee down the primal silences
  Where the heart hushes and the flesh is dumb
  Nay was not I the tide that drew thee out
  Relentlessly from the detaining shore
  Forth from the homelights and the hailing voices
  Forth from the last faint headlands failing line
  Till I enveloped thee from verge to verge
  And hid thee in the hollow of my being
  And still because between us hung the veil
  The myriadtinted veil of sense thy feet
  Refused their rest thy hands the gifts of life
  Thy heart its losses lest some lesser face
  Should blur mine image in thine upturned soul
  Ere death had stamped it there This was thy thought
  And mine

  The gods they say have all not so
  This have theyflocks on every hill the blue
  Spirals of incense and the amber drip
  Of lucid honeycomb on sylvan shrines
  Firstchosen weanlings doves immaculate
  Twincooing in the osierplaited cage
  And ivygarlands glaucous with the dew
  Mans wealth mans servitude but not himself
  And so they pale for lack of warmth they wane
  Freeze to the marble of their images
  And pinnacled on mans subserviency
  Through the thick sacrificial haze discern
  Unheeding lives and loves as some cold peak
  Through icy mists may enviously descry
  Warm vales unzoned to the allfruitful sun
  So they along an immortality
  Of endlessenvistaed homage strain their gaze
  If haply some rash votary emptyurned
  But light of foot with alladventuring hand
  Break rank fling past the people and the priest
  Up the last step on to the inmost shrine
  And there the sacred curtain in his clutch
  Drop dead of seeingwhile the others prayed
  Yes this we wait for this renews us this
  Incarnates us pale people of your dreams
  Who are but what you make us wood or stone
  Or cold chryselephantine hung with gems
  Or else the beating purpose of your life
  Your sword your clay the note your pipe pursues
  The face that haunts your pillow or the light
  Scarce visible over leagues of labouring sea
  O thus through use to reign again to drink
  The cup of peradventure to the lees
  For one dear instant disimmortalised
  In giving immortality
  So dream the gods upon their listless thrones
  Yet sometimes when the votary appears
  With deathaffronting forehead and glad eyes
  Too young they rather muse too frail thou art
  And shall we rob some girl of saffron veil
  And nuptial garland for so slight a thing
  And so to their incurious loves return

  Not so with thee for some indeed there are
  Who would behold the truth and then return
  To pine among the semblancesbut I
  Divined in thee the questing foot that never
  Revisits the cold hearth of yesterday
  Or calls achievement home I from afar
  Beheld thee fashioned for one hours high use
  Nor meant to slake oblivion drop by drop
  Long long hadst thou inhabited my dreams
  Surprising me as harts surprise a pool
  Stealing to drink at midnight I divined
  Thee rash to reach the heart of life and lie
  Bosom to bosom in occasions arms
  And said Because I love thee thou shalt die

  For immortality is not to range
  Unlimited through vast Olympian days
  Or sit in dull dominion over time
  But thisto drink fates utmost at a draught
  Nor feel the wine grow stale upon the lip
  To scale the summit of some soaring moment
  Nor know the dulness of the long descent
  To snatch the crown of life and seal it up
  Secure forever in the vaults of death

  And this was thine to lose thyself in me
  Relive in my renewal and become
  The light of other lives a quenchless torch
  Passed on from hand to hand till men are dust
  And the last garland withers from my shrine




  LIFE


  NAY lift me to thy lips Life and once more
  Pour the wild music through me

  I quivered in the reedbed with my kind
  Rooted in Lethebank when at the dawn
  There came a groping shape of mystery
  Moving among us that with random stroke
  Severed and rapt me from my silent tribe
  Pierced fashioned lipped me sounding for a voice
  Laughing on Lethebankand in my throat
  I felt the wingbeat of the fledgeling notes
  The bubble of godlike laughter in my throat

  Such little songs she sang
  Pursing her lips to fit the tiny pipe
  They trickled from me like a slender spring
  That strings frail woodgrowths on its crystal thread
  Nor dreams of glassing cities bearing ships
  She sang and bore me through the April world
  Matching the birds doubling the insecthum
  In the meadows under the lowmoving airs
  And breathings of the scarcearticulate air
  When it makes mouths of grassesbut when the sky
  Burst into storm and took great trees for pipes
  She thrust me in her breast and warm beneath
  Her cloudy vesture on her terrible heart
  I shook and heard the battle

  But more oft
  Those early days we moved in charmed woods
  Where once at dusk she piped against a faun
  And one warm dawn a tree became a nymph
  Listening and trembled and Life laughed and passed
  And once we came to a great stream that bore
  The stars upon its bosom like a sea
  And ships like stars so to the sea we came
  And there she raised me to her lips and sent
  One swift pang through me then refrained her hand
  And whispered Hear and into my frail flanks
  Into my bursting veins the whole sea poured
  Its spaces and its thunder and I feared

  We came to cities and Life piped on me
  Low calls to dreaming girls
  In countinghouse windows through the chink of gold
  Flung cries that fired the captive brain of youth
  And made the heavy merchant at his desk
  Curse us for a cracked hurdygurdy Life
  Mimicked the hurdygurdy and we passed

  We climbed the slopes of solitude and there
  Life met a god who challenged her and said
  Thy pipe against my lyre But Wait she laughed
  And in my live flank dug a fingerhole
  And wrung new music from it Ah the pain

  We climbed and climbed and left the god behind
  We saw the earth spread vaster than the sea
  With infinite surge of mountains surfed with snow
  And a silence that was louder than the deep
  But on the utmost pinnacle Life again
  Hid me and I heard the terror in her hair

  Safe in new vales I ached for the old pang
  And clamoured Play me against a god again
  Poor Marsyasmortalhe shall bleed thee yet
  She breathed and kissed me stilling the dim need
  But evermore it woke and stabbed my flank
  With yearnings for new music and new pain
  Another note against another god
  I clamoured and she answered Bide my time
  Of every heartwound I will make a stop
  And drink thy life in music pang by pang
  But first thou must yield the notes I stored in thee
  At dawn beside the river Take my lips

  She kissed me like a lover but I wept
  Remembering that high song against the god
  And the old songs slept in me and I was dumb

  We came to cavernous foul places blind
  With harpywings and sulphurous with the glare
  Of sinful furnaceswhere hunger toiled
  And pleasure gathered in a starveling prey
  And death fed delicately on young bones

  Now sing cried Life and set her lips to me
  Here are gods also Wilt thou pipe for Dis
  My cry was drowned beneath the furnace roar
  Choked by the sulphurfumes and beastlipped gods
  Laughed down on me and mouthed the flutes of hell

  Now sing said Life reissuing to the stars
  And wrung a new note from my wounded side

  So came we to clear spaces and the sea
  And now I felt its volume in my heart
  And my heart waxed with it and Life played on me
  The song of the Infinite Now the stars she said

  Then from the utmost pinnacle again
  She poured me on the wild sidereal stream
  And I grew with her great breathings till we swept
  The interstellar spaces like new worlds
  Loosed from the fiery ruin of a star

  Cold cold we rested on black peaks again
  Under black skies under a groping wind
  And Life grown old hugged me to a numb breast
  Pressing numb lips against me Suddenly
  A blade of silver severed the black peaks
  From the black sky and earth was born again
  Breathing and various under a gods feet
  A god A god I felt the heart of Life
  Leap under me and my cold flanks shook again
  He bore no lyre he rang no challenge out
  But Life warmed to him warming me with her
  And as he neared I felt beneath her hands
  The stab of a new wound that sucked my soul
  Forth in a new song from my throbbing throat

  His namehis name I whispered but she shed
  The music faster and I grew with it
  Became a part of it while Life and I
  Clung lip to lip and I from her wrung song
  As she from me one song one ecstasy
  In indistinguishable union blent
  Till she became the flute and I the player
  And lo the song I played on her was more
  Than any she had drawn from me it held
  The stars the peaks the cities and the sea
  The fauns catch the nymphs tremor and the heart
  Of dreaming girls of toilers at the desk
  Apollos challenge on the sunrise slope
  And the hiss of the nightgods mouthing flutes of hell
  All to the dawnwinds whisper in the reeds
  When Life first came a shape of mystery
  Moving among us and with random stroke
  Severed and rapt me from my silent tribe
  All this I wrung from her in that deep hour
  While Love stood murmuring Play the god poor grass

  Now by that hour I am a mate to thee
  Forever Life however spent and clogged
  And tossed back useless to my native mud
  Yea groping for new reeds to fashion thee
  New instruments of anguish and delight
  Thy hand shall leap to me thy broken reed
  Thine ear remember me thy bosom thrill
  With the old subjection then when Love and I
  Held thee and fashioned thee and made thee dance
  Like a slavegirl to her pipersyea thou yet
  Shalt hear my call and dropping all thy toys
  Thoult lift me to thy lips Life and once more
  Pour the wild music through me




  VESALIUS IN ZANTE See note at end

  


  SET wide the window Let me drink the day
  I loved light ever light in eye and brain
  No tapers mirrored in long palace floors
  Nor dedicated depths of silent aisles
  But just the common dusty windblown day
  That roofs earths millions

  O too long I walked
  In that thricesifted air that princes breathe
  Nor felt the heavenwide jostling of the winds
  And all the ancient outlawry of earth
  Now let me breathe and see

  This pilgrimage
  They call a penancelet them call it that
  I set my face to the East to shrive my soul
  Of mortal sin So be it If my blade
  Once questioned living flesh if once I tore
  The pages of the Book in opening it
  See what the torn page yielded ere the light
  Had paled its buried charactersand judge

  The girl they brought me pinioned hand and foot
  In catalepsysay I should have known
  That trance had not yet darkened into death
  And held my scalpel Well suppose I knew
  Sum up the factsher life against her death
  Her life The scum upon the pools of pleasure
  Breeds such by thousands And her death Perchance
  The obolus to appease the ferrying Shade
  And waft her into immortality
  Think what she purchased with that one heartflutter
  That whispered its deep secret to my blade
  For just because her bosom fluttered still
  It told me more than many rifled graves
  Because I spoke too soon she answered me
  Her vain life ripened to this bud of death
  As the whole plant is forced into one flower
  All her blank past a scroll on which God wrote
  His word of healingso that the poor flesh
  Which spread death living died to purchase life

  Ah no The sin I sinned was mine not theirs
  Not that they sent me forth to wash away
  None of their tariffed frailties but a deed
  So far beyond their grasp of good or ill
  That set to weigh it in the Churchs balance
  Scarce would they know which scale to cast it in
  But I I know I sinned against my will
  Myself my soulthe God within the breast
  Can any penance wash such sacrilege

  When I was young in Venice years ago
  I walked the hospice with a Spanish monk
  A solitary cloistered in high thoughts
  The great Loyola whom I reckoned then
  A mere refurbisher of faded creeds
  Expert to edge anew the arms of faith
  As who should say a Galenist resolved
  To hold the walls of dogma against fact
  Experience insight his own self if need be
  Ah how I pitied him mine own eyes set
  Straight in the level beams of Truth who groped
  In errors old deserted catacombs
  And lit his tapers upon empty graves
  Ay but he held his own the monkmore man
  Than any laurelled cripple of the wars
  Charless spent shafts for what he willed he willed
  As those do that forerun the wheels of fate
  Not take their dustthat force the virgin hours
  Hew life into the likeness of themselves
  And wrest the stars from their concurrences
  So firm his mould but mine the ductile soul
  That wears the livery of circumstance
  And hangs obsequious on its suzerains eye
  For who rules now The twilightflitting monk
  Or I that took the morning like an Alp
  He held his own I let mine slip from me
  The birthright that no sovereign can restore
  And so ironic Time beholds us now
  Master and slavehe lord of half the earth
  I ousted from my narrow heritage

  For theres the sting My kingdom knows me not
  Reach me that foliomy usurpers title
  Fallopius reigning vicenay not so
  Successor not usurper I am dead
  My throne stood empty he was heir to it
  Ay but who hewed his kingdom from the waste
  Cleared inch by inch the acres for his sowing
  Won back for man that ancient fief o the Church
  His body Who flung Galen from his seat
  And founded the great dynasty of truth
  In errors central kingdom

  Ask men that
  And see their answer just a wondering stare
  To learn things were not always as they are
  The very fight forgotten with the fighter
  Already grows the moss upon my grave
  Ay and so meethold fast to that Vesalius
  They only who reconquer day by day
  The inch of ground they camped on overnight
  Have right of foothold on this crowded earth
  I left mine own he seized it with it went
  My name my fame my very self it seems
  Till I am but the symbol of a man
  The signboard creaking oer an empty inn
  He names metrue Oh give the door its due
  I entered by Only I pray you note
  Had door been none a shoulderthrust of mine
  Had breached the crazy wallhe seems to say
  So meetand yet a word of thanks of praise
  Of recognition that the clue was found
  Seized followed clung to by some hand now dust
  Had this obscured his quartering of my shield

  How the one weakness stirs again I thought
  I had done with that old thirst for gratitude
  That lured me to the desert years ago
  I did my workand was not that enough
  No but because the idlers sneered and shrugged
  The envious whispered the traducers lied
  And friendship doubted where it should have cheered
  I flung aside the unfinished task sought praise
  Outside my souls esteem and learned too late
  That victory like Gods kingdom is within
  Nay let the folio rest upon my knee
  I do not feel its weight Ingratitude
  The hurrying traveller does not ask the name
  Of him who points him on his way and this
  Fallopius sits in the midheart of me
  Because he keeps his eye upon the goal
  Cuts a straight furrow to the end in view
  Cares not who oped the fountain by the way
  But drinks to draw fresh courage for his journey
  That was the lesson that Ignatius taught
  The one I might have learned from him but would not
  That we are but stray atoms on the wind
  A dancing transiency of summer eves
  Till we become one with our purpose merged
  In that vast effort of the race which makes
  Mortality immortal

  He that loseth
  His life shall find it so the Scripture runs
  But I so hugged the fleeting self in me
  So loved the lovely perishable hours
  So kissed myself to death upon their lips
  That on one pyre we perished in the end
  A grimmer bonfire than the Church eer lit
  Yet all was wellor seemed sotill I heard
  That younger voice an echo of my own
  And like a wanderer turning to his home
  Who finds another on the hearth and learns
  Halfdazed that other is his actual self
  In name and claim as the whole parish swears
  So strangely suddenly stood dispossessed
  Of that same self I had sold all to keep
  A baffled ghost that none would see or hear
  Vesalius Whos Vesalius This Fallopius
  It is who dragged the Galenidol down
  Who rent the veil of flesh and forced a way
  Into the secret fortalice of life
  Yet it was I that bore the brunt of it

  Well better so Better awake and live
  My last brief moment as the man I was
  Than lapse from lifes long lethargy to death
  Without one conscious interval At least
  I repossess my past am once again
  No courtier medcining the whims of kings
  In muffled palacechambers but the free
  Friendless Vesalius with his back to the wall
  And all the world against him O for that
  Best gift of all Fallopius take my thanks
  That and much more At first when Padua wrote
  Master Fallopius dead resume again
  The chair even he could not completely fill
  And see what usury age shall take of youth
  In honours forfeitedwhy just at first
  I was quite simply credulously glad
  To think the old life stood ajar for me
  Like a fond womans unforgetting heart
  But now that death waylays menow I know
  This isle is the circumference of my days
  And I shall die here in a little while
  So also best Fallopius

  For I see
  The gods may give anew but not restore
  And though I think that in my chair again
  I might have argued my supplanters wrong
  In this or thatthis Cesalpinus say
  With all his hotfoot blundering in the dark
  Fabricius with his overcautious clutch
  On Galen systole and diastole
  Of Truths mysterious heartyet other ways
  It may be that this dying serves the cause
  For Truth stays not to build her monument
  For this or that cooperating hand
  But props it with her servants failuresnay
  Cements its courses with their blood and brains
  A living substance that shall clinch her walls
  Against the assaults of time Already see
  Her scaffold rises on my hidden toil
  I but the accepted premiss whence must spring
  The airy structure of her argument
  Nor could the bricks it rests on serve to build
  The crowning finials I abide her law
  A different substance for a different end
  Content to know I hold the building up
  Though men agape at dome and pinnacles
  Guess not the whole must crumble like a dream
  But for that buried labour underneath
  Yet Padua I had still my word to say
  Let others say itAh but will they guess
  Just the one word Nay Truth is manytongued
  What one man failed to speak another finds
  Another word for May not all converge
  In some vast utterance of which you and I
  Fallopius were but halting syllables
  So knowledge come no matter how it comes
  No matter whence the light falls so it fall
  Truths way not minethat I whose service failed
  In action yet may make amends in praise
  Fabricius Cesalpinus say your word
  Not yours or mine but Truths as you receive it
  You miss a point I saw See others then
  Misread my meaning Yet expound your own
  Obscure one space I cleared The sky is wide
  And you may yet uncover other stars
  For thus I read the meaning of this end
  There are two ways of spreading light to be
  The candle or the mirror that reflects it
  I let my wick burn outthere yet remains
  To spread an answering surface to the flame
  That others kindle

  Turn me in my bed
  The window darkens as the hours swing round
  But yonder look the other casement glows
  Let me face westward as my sun goes down




  MARGARET OF CORTONA


  FRA PAOLO since they say the end is near
  And you of all men have the gentlest eyes
  Most like our father Francis since you know
  How I have toiled and prayed and scourged and striven
  Mothered the orphan waked beside the sick
  Gone empty that mine enemy might eat
  Given bread for stones in famine years and channelled
  With vigilant knees the pavement of this cell
  Till I constrained the Christ upon the wall
  To bend His thorncrowned Head in mute forgiveness   
  Three times He bowed it    but the whole stands writ
  Sealed with the Bishops signet as you know
  Once for each person of the Blessed Three
  A miracle that the whole town attests
  The very babes thrust forward for my blessing
  And either parish plotting for my bones
  Since this you know sit near and bear with me

  I have lain here these many empty days
  I thought to pack with Credos and Hail Marys
  So close that not a fear should force the door
  But still between the blessed syllables
  That taper up like blazing angel heads
  Praise over praise to the Unutterable
  Strange questions clutch me thrusting fiery arms
  As though athwart the closemeshed litanies
  My dead should pluck at me from hell with eyes
  Alive in their obliterated faces   
  I have tried the saints names and our blessed Mothers
  Fra Paolo I have tried them oer and oer
  And like a blade bent backward at first thrust
  They yield and fail meand the questions stay
  And so I thought into some human heart
  Pure and yet footworn with the tread of sin
  If only I might creep for sanctuary
  It might be that those eyes would let me rest  

  Fra Paolo listen How should I forget
  The day I saw him first You know the one
  I had been laughing in the marketplace
  With others like me I the youngest there
  Jostling about a pack of mountebanks
  Like flies on carrion I the youngest there
  Till darkness fell and while the other girls
  Turned this way that way as perdition beckoned
  I wondering what the night would bring half hoping
  If not this once a childs sleep in my garret
  At least enough to buy that twopronged coral
  The others covet gainst the evil eye
  Since after all one sees that Im the youngest
  So muttering my litany to hell
  The only prayer I knew that was not Latin
  Felt on my arm a touch as kind as yours
  And heard a voice as kind as yours say Come
  I turned and went and from that day I never
  Looked on the face of any other man
  So much is known so much effaced the sin
  Cast like a plaguestruck body to the sea
  Deep deep into the unfathomable pardon
  The Head bowed thrice as the whole town attests
  What more then To what purpose Bear with me

  It seems that he a stranger in the place
  First noted me that afternoon and wondered
  How grew so white a bud in such black slime
  And why not mine the hand to pluck it out
  Why so Christ deals with souls you crywhat then
  Not so Not so When Christ the heavenly gardener
  Plucks flowers for Paradise do I not know
  He snaps the stem above the root and presses
  The ransomed soul between two convent walls
  A lifeless blossom in the Book of Life
  But when my lover gathered me he lifted
  Stem root and allay and the clinging mud
  And set me on his sill to spread and bloom
  After the common way take sun and rain
  And make a patch of brightness for the street
  Though raised above rough fingersso you make
  A weed a flower and others passing think
  Next ditch I cross Ill lift a root from it
  And dress my window    and the blessing spreads
  Well so I grew with every root and tendril
  Grappling the secret anchorage of his love
  And so we loved each other till he died   

  Ah that black night he left me that dead dawn
  I found him lying in the woods alive
  To gasp my name out and his lifeblood with it
  As though the murderers knife had probed for me
  In his hacked breast and found me in each wound  
  Well it was there Christ came to me you know
  And led me homejust as that other led me
  Just as that other Father bear with me
  My lovers death they tell me saved my soul
  And I have lived to be a light to men
  And gather sinners to the knees of grace
  All this you say the Bishops signet covers
  But stay Suppose my lover had not died
  At last my question Father help me face it
  I say Suppose my lover had not died
  Think you I ever would have left him living
  Even to be Christs blessed Margaret
  We lived in sin Why to the sin I died to
  That other was as Paradise when God
  Walks there at eventide the air pure gold
  And angels treading all the grass to flowers
  He was my Christhe led me out of hell
  He died to save me so your casuists say
  Could Christ do more Your Christ outpity mine
  Why yours but let the sinner bathe His feet
  Mine raised her to the level of his heart  
  And then Christs way is saving as mans way
  Is squanderingand the devil take the shards
  But this man kept for sacramental use
  The cup that once had slaked a passing thirst
  This man declared The same clay serves to model
  A devil or a saint the scribe may stain
  The same fair parchment with obscenities
  Or gild with benedictions nay he cried
  Because a satyr feasted in this wood
  And fouled the grasses with carousing foot
  Shall not a hermit build his chapel here
  And cleanse the echoes with his litanies
  The sodden grasses spring againwhy not
  The trampled soul Is man less merciful
  Than nature good more fugitive than grass
  And soif after all he had not died
  And suddenly that door should know his hand
  And with that voice as kind as yours he said
  Come Margaret forth into the sun again
  Back to the life we fashioned with our hands
  Out of old sins and follies fragments scorned
  Of more ambitious builders yet by Love
  The patient architect so shaped and fitted
  That not a crevice let the winter in
  Think you my bones would not arise and walk
  This bruised body as once the bruised soul
  Turn from the wonders of the seventh heaven
  As from the antics of the marketplace
  If this could be as I so oft have dreamed
  I who have known both loves divine and human
  Think you I would not leave this Christ for that

  I rave you say You start from me Fra Paolo
  Go then your going leaves me not alone
  I marvel rather that I feared the question
  Since now I name it it draws near to me
  With such dear reassurance in its eyes
  And takes your place beside me  

  Nay I tell you
  Fra Paolo I have cried on all the saints
  If this be devils prompting let them drown it
  In Alleluias Yet not one replies
  And for the Christ thereis He silent too
  Your Christ Poor father you that have but one
  And that one silenthow I pity you
  He will not answer Will not help you cast
  The devil out But hangs there on the wall
  Blind wood and bone

  How if I call on Him
  I whom He talks with as the town attests
  If ever prayer hath ravished me so high
  That its wings failed and dropped me in Thy breast
  Christ I adjure Thee By that naked hour
  Of innermost commixture when my soul
  Contained Thee as the paten holds the host
  Judge Thou alone between this priest and me
  Nay rather Lord between my past and present
  Thy Margaret and that otherswhose she is
  By right of salvageand whose call should follow
  Thine Silent stillOr his who stooped to her
  And drew her to Thee by the bands of love
  Not Thine Then his

  Ah Christthe thorncrowned Head
  Bends    bends again    down on your knees

  Fra Paolo
  If his then Thine

  Kneel priest for this is heaven  




  A TORCHBEARER


  GREAT cities rise and have their fall the brass
  That held their glories moulders in its turn
  Hard granite rots like an uprooted weed
  And ever on the palimpsest of earth
  Impatient Time rubs out the word he writ
  But one thing makes the years its pedestal
  Springs from the ashes of its pyre and claps
  A skyward wing above its epitaph
  The will of man willing immortal things

  The ages are but baubles hung upon
  The thread of some strong livesand one slight wrist
  May lift a century above the dust
  For Time
  The Sisyphean load of little lives
  Becomes the globe and sceptre of the great
  But who are these that linking hand in hand
  Transmit across the twilight waste of years
  The flying brightness of a kindled hour
  Not always nor alone the lives that search
  How they may snatch a glory out of heaven
  Or add a height to Babel oftener they
  That in the still fulfilment of each days
  Pacific order hold great deeds in leash
  That in the sober sheath of tranquil tasks
  Hide the attempered blade of high emprise
  And leap like lightning to the clap of fate

  So greatly gave he nurturing gainst the call
  Of one rare moment all the daily store
  Of joy distilled from the acquitted task
  And that deliberate rashness which bespeaks
  The pondered action passed into the blood
  So swift to harden purpose into deed
  That with the wind of ruin in his hair
  Soul sprang fullstatured from the broken flesh
  And at one stroke he lived the whole of life
  Poured all in one libation to the truth
  A brimming flood whose drops shall overflow
  On deserts of the soul long beaten down
  By the brute hoof of habit till they spring
  In manifold upheaval to the sun

  Call here no high artificer to raise
  His wordy monumentsuch lives as these
  Make death a dull misnomer and its pomp
  An empty vesture Let resounding lives
  Reecho splendidly through highpiled vaults
  And make the grave their spokesmansuch as he
  Are as the hidden streams that underground
  Sweeten the pastures for the grazing kine
  Or as spring airs that bring through prison bars
  The scent of freedom or a light that burns
  Immutably across the shaken seas
  Forevermore by nameless hands renewed
  Where else were darkness and a glutted shore

  THE MORTAL LEASE


  I

  BECAUSE the currents of our love are poured
  Through the slow welter of the primal flood
  From some blind source of monsterhaunted mud
  And flung together by random forces stored
  Ere the vast void with rushing worlds was scored
  Because we know ourselves but the dim scud
  Tossed from their heedless keels the seablown bud
  That wastes and scatters ere the wave has roared

  Because we have this knowledge in our veins
  Shall we deny the journeys gathered lore
  The great refusals and the long disdains
  The stubborn questing for a phantom shore
  The sleepless hopes and memorable pains
  And all mortalitys immortal gains


  II

  Because our kiss is as the moon to draw
  The mounting waters of that redlit sea
  That circles brain with sense and bids us be
  The playthings of an elemental law
  Shall we forego the deeper touch of awe
  On loves extremest pinnacle where we
  Winging the vistas of infinity
  Gigantic on the mist our shadows saw

  Shall kinship with the dim firstmoving clod
  Not draw the folded pinion from the soul
  And shall we not by spirals visiontrod
  Reach upward to some stillretreating goal
  As earth escaping from the nights control
  Drinks at the founts of morning like a god


  III

  All all is sweet in that commingled draught
  Mysterious that life pours for lovers thirst
  And I would meet your passion as the first
  Wild woodland woman met her captors craft
  Or as the Greek whose fearless beauty laughed
  And doffed her raiment by the Attic flood
  But in the streams of my belated blood
  Flow all the warring potions love has quaffed

  How can I be to you the nymph who danced
  Smooth by Ilissus as the planetrees bole
  Or how the Nereid whose drenched lashes glanced
  Like seaflowers through the summer seas long roll
  I that have also been the nun entranced
  Who nightlong held her Bridegroom in her soul


  IV

  Sad Immortality is dead you say
  And all her grey brood banished from the soul
  Life like the earth is now a rounded whole
  The orb of mans dominion Live today
  And every sense in me leapt to obey
  Seeing the routed phantoms backward roll
  But from their waning throng a whisper stole
  And touched the morning splendour with decay

  Sad Immortality is dead and we
  The funeral train that bear her to her grave
  Yet hath she left a twofaced progeny
  In hearts of men and some will always see
  The skull beneath the wreath yet always crave
  In every kiss the folded kiss to be


  V

  Yet for one rounded moment I will be
  No more to you than what my lips may give
  And in the circle of your kisses live
  As in some island of a stormblown sea
  Where the cold surges of infinity
  Upon the outward reefs unheeded grieve
  And the loud murmur of our blood shall weave
  Primeval silences round you and me

  If in that moment we are all we are
  We live enough Let this for all requite
  Do I not know some winged things from far
  Are borne along illimitable night
  To dance their lives out in a single flight
  Between the moonrise and the setting star


  VI

  The Moment came with sacramental cup
  Liftedand all the vault of life grew bright
  With tides of incommensurable light
  But tremblingly I turned and covered up
  My face before the wonder Down the slope
  I heard her feet in irretrievable flight
  And when I looked again my stricken sight
  Saw night and rain in a dead world agrope

  Now walks her ghost beside me whispering
  With lips derisive Thou that wouldst forego
  What god assured thee that the cup I bring
  Globes not in every drop the cosmic show
  All that the insatiate heart of man can wring
  From lifes long vintageNow thou shalt not know


  VII

  Shall I not know I that could always catch
  The sunrise in one beam along the wall
  The nests of June in Aprils mating call
  And ruinous autumn in the winds first snatch
  At summers green impenetrable thatch
  That always knew far off the secret fall
  Of a gods feet across the citys brawl
  The touch of silent fingers on my latch

  Not thou vain Moment Something more than thou
  Shall write the score of what mine eyes have wept
  The touch of kisses that have missed my brow
  The murmur of wings that brushed me while I slept
  And some mute angel in the breast even now
  Measures my loss by all that I have kept


  VIII

  Strive we no more Some hearts are like the bright
  Treechequered spaces flecked with sun and shade
  Where gathered in old days the youth and maid
  To woo and weave their dances with the night
  They cease their flutings and the next days light
  Finds the smooth green unconscious of their tread
  And ready its velvet pliancies to spread
  Under fresh feet till these in turn take flight

  But other hearts a long long road doth span
  From some far region of old works and wars
  And the weary armies of the thoughts of man
  Have trampled it and furrowed it with scars
  And sometimes husht a sacred caravan
  Moves over it alone beneath the stars




  EXPERIENCE


  I

  LIKE Crusoe with the bootless gold we stand
  Upon the desert verge of death and say
  What shall avail the woes of yesterday
  To buy tomorrows wisdom in the land
  Whose currency is strange unto our hand
  In lifes small market they had served to pay
  Some latefound rapture could we but delay
  Till Time hath matched our means to our demand

  But otherwise Fate wills it for behold
  Our gathered strength of individual pain
  When Times long alchemy hath made it gold
  Dies with ushoarded all these years in vain
  Since those that might be heir to it the mould
  Renew and coin themselves new griefs again


  II

  O Death we come fullhanded to thy gate
  Rich with strange burden of the mingled years
  Gains and renunciations mirth and tears
  And loves oblivion and remembering hate
  Nor know we what compulsion laid such freight
  Upon our soulsand shall our hopes and fears
  Buy nothing of thee Death Behold our wares
  And sell us the one joy for which we wait
  Had we lived longer life had such for sale
  With the last coin of sorrow purchased cheap
  But now we stand before thy shadowy pale
  And all our longings lie within thy keep
  Death can it be the years shall naught avail

  Not so Death answered they shall purchase sleep




  GRIEF


  I

  ON immemorial altitudes august
  Grief holds her high dominion Bold the feet
  That climb unblenching to that stern retreat
  Whence looking down man knows himself but dust
  There lie the mightiest passions earthward thrust
  Beneath her regnant footstool and there meet
  Pale ghosts of buried longings that were sweet
  With many an abdicated shall and must

  For there she rules omnipotent whose will
  Compels a mute acceptance of her chart
  Who holds the world and lo it cannot fill
  Her mighty hand who will be served apart
  With uncommunicable rites and still
  Surrender of the undivided heart


  II

  She holds the world within her mighty hand
  And lo it is a toy for babes to toss
  And all its shining imagery but dross
  To those that in her awful presence stand
  As sunconfronting eagles oer the land
  That lies below they send their gaze across
  The common intervals of gain and loss
  And hopes infinitude without a strand

  But he who on that lonely eminence
  Watches too long the whirling of the spheres
  Through dim eternities descending thence
  The voices of his kind no longer hears
  And blinded by the spectacle immense
  Journeys alone through all the after years




  CHARTRES


  I

  IMMENSE august like some Titanic bloom
  The mighty choir unfolds its lithic core
  Petalled with panes of azure gules and or
  Splendidly lambent in the Gothic gloom
  And stamened with keen flamelets that illume
  The pale highaltar On the prayerworn floor
  By worshippers innumerous thronged of yore
  A few brown crones familiars of the tomb
  The stranded driftwood of Faiths ebbing sea
  For these alone the finials fret the skies
  The topmost bosses shake their blossoms free
  While from the triple portals with grave eyes
  Tranquil and fixed upon eternity
  The cloud of witnesses still testifies


  II

  The crimson panes like blooddrops stigmatise
  The western floor The aisles are mute and cold
  A rigid fetich in her robe of gold
  The Virgin of the Pillar with blank eyes
  Enthroned beneath her votive canopies
  Gathers a meagre remnant to her fold
  The rest is solitude the church grown old
  Stands stark and grey beneath the burning skies
  Wellnigh again its mighty framework grows
  To be a part of natures self withdrawn
  From hot humanitys impatient woes
  The floor is ridged like some rude mountain lawn
  And in the east one giant window shows
  The roseate coldness of an Alp at dawn




  TWO BACKGROUNDS


  I

  LA VIERGE AU DONATEUR

  HERE by the ample rivers argent sweep
  Bosomed in tilth and vintage to her walls
  A towercrowned Cybele in armoured sleep
  The city lies fat plenty in her halls
  With calm parochial spires that hold in fee
  The friendly gables clustered at their base
  And equipoised oer tower and marketplace
  The Gothic ministers winged immensity
  And in that narrow burgh with equal mood
  Two placid hearts to all lifes good resigned
  Might from the altar to the lychgate find
  Long years of peace and dreamless plenitude




  II

  MONA LISA

  Yon strange blue city crowns a scarped steep
  No mortal foot hath bloodlessly essayed
  Dreams and illusions beacon from its keep
  But at the gate an Angel bares his blade
  And tales are told of those who thought to gain
  At dawn its ramparts but when evening fell
  Far off they saw each fading pinnacle
  Lit with wild lightnings from the heaven of pain
  Yet there two souls whom lifes perversities
  Had mocked with want in plenty tears in mirth
  Might meet in dreams ungarmented of earth
  And drain Joys awful chalice to the lees




  THE TOMB OF ILARIA GIUNIGI


  ILARIA thou that wert so fair and dear
  That death would fain disown thee grief made wise
  With prophecy thy husbands widowed eyes
  And bade him call the masters art to rear
  Thy perfect image on the sculptured bier
  With dreaming lids hands laid in peaceful guise
  Beneath the breast that seems to fall and rise
  And lips that at loves call should answer Here

  Firstborn of the Renascence when thy soul
  Cast the sweet robing of the flesh aside
  Into these lovelier marble limbs it stole
  Regenerate in arts sunrise clear and wide
  As saints who having kept faiths raiment whole
  Change it above for garments glorified




  THE ONE GRIEF


  ONE grief there is the helpmeet of my heart
  That shall not from me till my days be sped
  That walks beside me in sunshine and in shade
  And hath in all my fortunes equal part
  At first I feared it and would often start
  Aghast to find it bending oer my bed
  Till usage slowly dulled the edge of dread
  And one cold night I cried How warm thou art

  Since then we two have travelled hand in hand
  And lo my grief has been interpreter
  For me in many a fierce and alien land
  Whose speech young Joy had failed to understand
  Plucking me tribute of red gold and myrrh
  From desolate whirlings of the desert sand




  THE EUMENIDES


  THINK you we slept within the Delphic bower
  What time our victim sought Apollos grace
  Nay drawn into ourselves in that deep place
  Where good and evil meet we bode our hour
  For not inexorable is our power
  And we are hunted of the prey we chase
  Soonest gain ground on them that flee apace
  And draw temerity from hearts that cower

  Shuddering we gather in the house of ruth
  And on the fearful turn a face of fear
  But they to whom the ways of doom are clear
  Not vainly named us the Eumenides
  Our feet are faithful in the paths of truth
  And in the constant heart we house at peace




  III


  ORPHEUS

Love will make men dare to die for their beloved   Of this
Alcestis is a monument    for she was willing to lay down her
life for her husband    and so noble did this appear to the gods
that they granted her the privilege of returning to earth    but
Orpheus the son of OEagrus they sent empty away  

PLATO The Symposium



  ORPHEUS the Harper coming to the gate
  Where the implacable dim warder sate
  Besought for parley with a shade within
  Dearer to him than life itself had been
  Sweeter than sunlight on Illyrian sea
  Or bloom of myrtle or murmur of laden bee
  Whom lately from his unconsenting breast
  The Fates at some capricious blind behest
  Intolerably had reftEurydice
  Dear to the sunlight as Illyrian sea
  Sweet as the murmur of bees or myrtle bloom
  And uncompanioned led her to the tomb

  There solitary by the Stygian tide
  Strayed her dear feet the shadow of his own
  Since mid the desolate millions who have died
  Each phantom walks its crowded path alone
  And there her head that slept upon his breast
  No more had such sweet harbour for its rest
  Nor her swift ear from those disvoiced throats
  Could catch one echo of his living notes
  And dreaming nightly of her pallid doom
  No solace had he of his own young bloom
  But yearned to pour his blood into her veins
  And buy her back with unimagined pains

  To whom the Shepherd of the Shadows said
  Yea many thus would bargain for their dead
  But when they hear my fatal gateway clang
  Life quivers in them with a last sweet pang
  They see the smoke of home above the trees
  The cordage whistles on the harbour breeze
  The beaten path that wanders to the shore
  Grows dear because they shall not tread it more
  The dog that drowsing on their threshold lies
  Looks at them with their childhood in his eyes
  And in the sunsets melancholy fall
  They read a sunrise that shall give them all

  Not thus am I the Harper smiled his scorn
  I see no path but those her feet have worn
  My rooftree is the shadow of her hair
  And the light breaking through her long despair
  The only sunrise that mine eyelids crave
  For doubly dead without me in the grave
  Is she who if my feet had gone before
  Had found life dark as deaths abhorred shore

  The gate clanged on him and he went his way
  Amid the alien millions mute and grey
  Swept like a cold mist down an unlit strand
  Where nameless wreckage gluts the stealthy sand
  Drift of the cockleshells of hope and faith
  Wherein they foundered on the rock of death

  So came he to the image that he sought
  Less living than her semblance in his thought
  Who at the summons of his thrilling notes
  Drew back to life as a drowned creature floats
  Back to the surface yet no less is dead
  And cold fear smote him till she spoke and said
  Art thou then come to lay thy lips on mine
  And pour thy lifes libation out like wine
  Shall I through thee revisit earth again
  Traverse the shining sea the fruitful plain
  Behold the house we dwelt in lay my head
  Upon the happy pillows of our bed
  And feel in dreams the pressure of thine arms
  Kindle these pulses that no memory warms
  Nay give me for a space upon thy breast
  Deaths shadowy substitute for rapturerest
  Then join again the joyous living throng
  And give me life but give it in thy song
  For only they that die themselves may give
  Life to the dead and I would have thee live

  Fear seized him closer than her arms but he
  Answered Not sofor thou shalt come with me
  I sought thee not that we should part again
  But that fresh joy should bud from the old pain
  And the gods if grudgingly their gifts they make
  Yield all to them that without asking take

  The gods she said so runs lifes ancient lore
  Yield all man takes but always claim their score
  The iron wings of the Eumenides
  When heard far off seem but a summer breeze
  But me thoult have alive on earth again
  Only by paying here my meed of pain
  Then lay on my cold lips the tender ghost
  Of the dear kiss that used to warm them most
  Take from my frozen hands thy hands of fire
  And of my heartstrings make thee a new lyre
  That in thy music men may find my voice
  And something of me still on earth rejoice

  Shuddering he heard her but with closeflung arm
  Swept her resisting through the ghostly swarm
  Swift hide thee neath my cloak that we may glide
  Past the dim warder as the gate swings wide
  He whirled her with him lighter than a leaf
  Unwittingly whirled onward by a brief
  Autumnal eddy but when the fatal door
  Suddenly yielded him to life once more
  And issuing to the allconsoling skies
  He turned to seek the sunlight in her eyes
  He clutched at emptinessshe was not there
  And the dim warder answered to his prayer
  Only once have I seen the wonder wrought
  But when Alcestis thus her master sought
  Living she sought him not nor dreamed that fate
  For any subterfuge would swing my gate
  Loving she gave herself to livid death
  Joyous she bought his respite with her breath
  Came not embodied but a tenuous shade
  In whom her rapture a great radiance made
  For never saw I ghost upon this shore
  Shine with such living ecstasy before
  Nor heard an exile from the light above
  Hail me with smiles Thou art not Death but Love

  But when the gods frustrated this beheld
  How living still among the dead she dwelled
  Because she lived in him whose life she won
  And her blood beat in his beneath the sun
  They reasoned When the bitter Stygian wave
  The sweetness of loves kisses cannot lave
  When the pale flood of Lethe washes not
  From mortal mind one high immortal thought
  Akin to us the earthly creature grows
  Since nature suffers only what it knows
  If she whom we to this grey desert banned
  Still dreams she treads with him the sunlit land
  That for his sake she left without a tear
  Set wide the gatesher being is not here

  So ruled the gods but thou that soughtst to give
  Thy life for love yet for thyself wouldst live
  They know not for their kin but back to earth
  Give pitying one that is of mortal birth

  Humbled the Harper heard and turned away
  Mounting alone to the empoverished day
  Yet as he left the Stygian shades behind
  He heard the cordage on the harbour wind
  Saw the blue smoke above the homestead trees
  And in his hidden heart was glad of these




  AN AUTUMN SUNSET


  I

  LEAGUERED in fire
  The wild black promontories of the coast extend
  Their savage silhouettes
  The sun in universal carnage sets
  And halting higher
  The motionless stormclouds mass their sullen threats
  Like an advancing mob in swordpoints penned
  That balked yet stands at bay
  Midzenith hangs the fascinated day
  In windlustrated hollows crystalline
  A wan Valkyrie whose wide pinions shine
  Across the ensanguined ruins of the fray
  And in her hand swings high oerhead
  Above the waste of war
  The silver torchlight of the evening star
  Wherewith to search the faces of the dead


  II

  Lagooned in gold
  Seem not those jetty promontories rather
  The outposts of some ancient land forlorn
  Uncomforted of morn
  Where old oblivions gather
  The melancholy unconsoling fold
  Of all things that go utterly to death
  And mix no more no more
  With lifes perpetually awakening breath
  Shall Time not ferry me to such a shore
  Over such sailless seas
  To walk with hopes slain importunities
  In miserable marriage Nay shall not
  All things be there forgot
  Save the seas golden barrier and the black
  Closecrouching promontories
  Dead to all shames forgotten of all glories
  Shall I not wander there a shadows shade
  A spectre selfdestroyed
  So purged of all remembrance and sucked back
  Into the primal void
  That should we on that shore phantasmal meet
  I should not know the coming of your feet




  MOONRISE OVER TYRINGHAM


  NOW the high holocaust of hours is done
  And all the west empurpled with their death
  How swift oblivion drinks the fallen sun
  How little while the dusk remembereth

  Though some there were proud hours that marched in mail
  And took the morning on auspicious crest
  Crying to fortune Back for I prevail
  Yet now they lie disfeatured with the rest

  And some that stole so soft on destiny
  Methought they had surprised her to a smile
  But these fled frozen when she turned to see
  And moaned and muttered through my heart awhile

  But now the day is emptied of them all
  And night absorbs their lifeblood at a draught
  And so my life lies as the gods let fall
  An empty cup from which their lips have quaffed

  Yet seenight is not    by translucent ways
  Up the grey void of autumn afternoon
  Steals a mild crescent charioted in haze
  And all the air is merciful as June

  The lake is a forgotten streak of day
  That trembles through the hemlocks darkling bars
  And still my heart still some divine delay
  Upon the threshold holds the earliest stars

  O pale equivocal hour whose suppliant feet
  Haunt the mute reaches of the sleeping wind
  Art thou a watcher stealing to entreat
  Prayer and sepulture for thy fallen kind

  Poor plaintive waif of a predestined race
  Their ruin gapes for thee Why linger here
  Go hence in silence Veil thine orphaned face
  Lest I should look on it and call it dear

  For if I love thee thou wilt sooner die
  Some sudden ruin will plunge upon thy head
  Midnight will fall from the revengeful sky
  And hurl thee down among thy shuddering dead

  Avert thine eyes Lapse softly from my sight
  Call not my name nor heed if thine I crave
  So shalt thou sink through mitigated night
  And bathe thee in the alleffacing wave

  But upward still thy perilous footsteps fare
  Along a highhung heaven drenched in light
  Dilating on a tide of crystal air
  That floods the dark hills to their utmost height

  Strange hour is this thy waning face that leans
  Out of midheaven and makes my soul its glass
  What victory is imaged there What means
  Thy tarrying smile Oh veil thy lips and pass

  Nay    pause and let me name thee For I see
  O with what flooding ecstasy of light
  Strange hour that wilt not loose thy hold on me
  Thourt not days latest but the first of night

  And after thee the goldfoot stars come thick
  From hand to hand they toss the flying fire
  Till all the zenith with their dance is quick
  About the wheeling music of the Lyre

  Dread hour that leadst the immemorial round
  With lifted torch revealing one by one
  The thronging splendours that the day held bound
  And how each blue abyss enshrines its sun

  Be thou the image of a thought that fares
  Forth from itself and flings its ray ahead
  Leaping the barriers of ephemeral cares
  To where our lives are but the ages tread

  And let this year be not the last of youth
  But firstlike theeof some new train of hours
  If more remote from hope yet nearer truth
  And kin to the unpetitionable powers




  ALL SOULS


  I

  A THIN moon faints in the sky oerhead
  And dumb in the churchyard lie the dead
  Walk we not Sweet by garden ways
  Where the late rose hangs and the phlox delays
  But forth of the gate and down the road
  Past the church and the yews to their dim abode
  For its turn of the year and All Souls night
  When the dead can hear and the dead have sight


  II

  Fear not that sound like wind in the trees
  It is only their call that comes on the breeze
  Fear not the shudder that seems to pass
  It is only the tread of their feet on the grass
  Fear not the drip of the bough as you stoop
  It is only the touch of their hands that grope
  For the years on the turn and its All Souls night
  When the dead can yearn and the dead can smite


  III

  And where should a man bring his sweet to woo
  But here where such hundreds were lovers too
  Where lie the dead lips that thirst to kiss
  The empty hands that their fellows miss
  Where the maid and her lover from sere to green
  Sleep bed by bed with the worm between
  For its turn of the year and All Souls night
  When the dead can hear and the dead have sight


  IV

  And now they rise and walk in the cold
  Let us warm their blood and give youth to the old
  Let them see us and hear us and say Ah thus
  In the prime of the year it went with us
  Till their lips drawn close and so long unkist
  Forget they are mist that mingles with mist
  For the years on the turn and its All Souls night
  When the dead can burn and the dead can smite


  V

  Till they say as they hear uspoor dead poor dead
  Just an hour of this and our agelong bed
  Just a thrill of the old remembered pains
  To kindle a flame in our frozen veins
  A touch and a sight and a floating apart
  As the chill of dawn strikes each phantom heart
  For its turn of the year and All Souls night
  When the dead can hear and the dead have sight


  VI

  And where should the living feel alive
  But here in this wan white humming hive
  As the moon wastes down and the dawn turns cold
  And one by one they creep back to the fold
  And where should a man hold his mate and say
  One more one more ere we go their way
  For the years on the turn and its All Souls night
  When the living can learn by the churchyard light


  VII

  And how should we break faith who have seen
  Those dead lips plight with the mist between
  And how forget who have seen how soon
  They lie thus chambered and cold to the moon
  How scorn how hate how strive wee too
  Who must do so soon as those others do
  For its All Souls night and break of the day
  And behold with the light the dead are away  




  ALL SAINTS


  ALL so grave and shining see they come
  From the blissful ranks of the forgiven
  Though so distant wheels the nearest crystal dome
  And the spheres are seven

  Are you in such haste to come to earth
  Shining ones the Wonder on your brow
  To the low poor places of your birth
  And the day that must be darkness now

  Does the heart still crave the spot it yearned on
  In the grey and mortal years
  The pure flame the smoky hearth it burned on
  The clear eye its tears

  Was there in the narrow range of living
  After all the wider scope
  In the old old rapture of forgiving
  In the long long flight of hope

  Come you from free sweep across the spaces
  To the irksome bounds of mortal law
  From the allembracing Vision to some faces
  Look that never saw

  Never we imprisoned here had sought you
  Lured you with the ancient bait of pain
  Down the silver current of the lightyears brought you
  To the beaten round again

  Is it you perchance who ache to strain us
  Dumbly to the dim transfigured breast
  Or with tragic gesture would detain us
  From the agelong search for rest

  Is the labour then more glorious than the laurel
  The learning than the conquered thought
  Is the meed of men the righteous quarrel
  Not the justice wrought

  Long ago we guessed it faithful ghosts
  Proudly chose the present for our scene
  And sent out indomitable hosts
  Day by day to widen our demesne

  Sit you by our hearthstone lone immortals
  Share again the bitter wine of life
  Well we know beyond the peaceful portals
  There is nothing better than our strife

  Nought more thrilling than the cry that calls us
  Spent and stumbling to the conflict vain
  After each disaster that befalls us
  Nerves us for a sterner strain

  And when flood or foeman shakes the sleeper
  In his moments lapse from pain
  Bids us fold our tents and flee our kin and deeper
  Drive into the wilderness again




  THE OLD POLE STAR


  BEFORE the clepsydra had bound the days
  Man tethered Change to his fixed star and said
  The elder races that long since are dead
  Marched by that light it swerves not from its base
  Though all the worlds about it wax and fade

  When Egypt saw it fast in reeling spheres
  Her Pyramids shaftcentred on its ray
  She reared and said Long as this star holds sway
  In uninvaded ether shall the years
  Revere my monuments and went her way

  The Pyramids abide but through the shaft
  That held the polar pivot eye to eye
  Look nowblank nothingness As though Change laughed
  At mans presumption and his puny craft
  The star has slipped its leash and roams the sky

  Yet could the immemorial piles be swung
  A skyey hairsbreadth from their rooted base
  Back to the central anchorage of space
  Ah then again as when the race was young
  Should they behold the beacon of the race

  Of old men said The Truth is there we rear
  Our faith fullcentred on it It was known
  Thus of the elders who foreran us here
  Mapped out its circuit in the shifting sphere
  And found it mid mutation fixed alone

  Change laughs again again the sky is cold
  And down that fissure now no starbeam glides
  Yet they whose sweep of vision grows not old
  Still at the central point of space behold
  Another polestar for the Truth abides




  A GRAVE


  THOUGH life should come
  With all its marshalled honours trump and drum
  To proffer you the captaincy of some
  Resounding exploit that shall fill
  Mans pulses with commemorative thrill
  And be a banner to far battle days
  For truths unrisen upon untrod ways
  What would your answer be
  O heart once brave
  Seek otherwhere for me
  I watch beside a grave

  Though to some shining festival of thought
  The sages call you from steep citadel
  Of bastioned argument whose rampart gained
  Yields the pure vision passionately sought
  In dreams known well
  But never yet in wakefulness attained
  How should you answer to their summons save
  I watch beside a grave

  Though Beauty from her fane within the soul
  Of firetongued seers descending
  Or from the dreamlit temples of the past
  With feet immortal wending
  Illuminate griefs antre swart and vast
  With halfveiled face that promises the whole
  To him who holds her fast
  What answer could you give
  Sight of one face I crave
  One only while I live
  Woo elsewhere for I watch beside a grave

  Though love of the one heart that loves you best
  A stormtossed messenger
  Should beat its wings for shelter in your breast
  Where clung its last years nest
  The nest you built together and made fast
  Lest envious winds should stir
  And winged each delicate thought to minister
  With sweetness faramassed
  To the young dreams within
  What answer could it win
  The nest was whelmed in sorrows rising wave
  Nor could I reach one drowning dream to save
  I watch beside a grave




  NON DOLET


  AGE after age the fruit of knowledge falls
  To ashes on mens lips
  Love fails faith sickens like a dying tree
  Life sheds its dreams that no new spring recalls
  The longedfor ships
  Come empty home or founder on the deep
  And eyes first lose their tears and then their sleep

  So weary a world it lies forlorn of day
  And yet not wholly dark
  Since evermore some soul that missed the mark
  Calls back to those agrope
  In the mad maze of hope
  Courage my brothersI have found the way

  The day is lost What then
  What though the straggling rearguard of the fight
  Be whelmed in fear and night
  And the flying scouts proclaim
  That death has gripped the van
  Ever the heart of man
  Cheers on the hearts of men

  It hurts not dying cried the Roman wife
  And one by one
  The leaders in the strife
  Fall on the blade of failure and exclaim
  The day is won




  A HUNTINGSONG


  HUNTERS where does Hope nest
  Not in the halfoped breast
  Nor the young rose
  Nor April sunrisethose
  With a quick wing she brushes
  The wide world through
  Greets with the throat of thrushes
  Fades from as fast as dew

  But would you spy her sleeping
  Cradled warm
  Look in the breast of weeping
  The tree stript by storm
  But would you bind her fast
  Yours at last
  Bedmate and lover
  Gain the last headland bare
  That the cold tides cover
  There may you capture her there
  Where the sea gives to the ground
  Only the drift of the drowned
  Yet if she slips you once found
  Push to her uttermost lair
  In the low house of despair
  There will she watch by your head
  Sing to you till you be dead
  Then with your child in her breast
  In another heart build a new nest




  SURVIVAL


  WHEN you and I like all things kind or cruel
  The garnered days and light evasive hours
  Are gone again to be a part of flowers
  And tears and tides in lifes divine renewal

  If some grey eve to certain eyes should wear
  A deeper radiance than mere light can give
  Some silent page abruptly flush and live
  May it not be that you and I are there




  USES


  AH from the niggard tree of Time
  How quickly fall the hours
  It needs no touch of wind or rime
  To loose such facile flowers

  Drift of the dead years harvesting
  They clog tomorrows way
  Yet serve to shelter growths of spring
  Beneath their warm decay

  Or blent by pious hands with rare
  Sweet savours of content
  Surprise the souls December air
  With Junes forgotten scent




  A MEETING


  ON a sheer peak of joy we meet
  Below us hums the abyss
  Death either way allures our feet
  If we take one step amiss

  One moment let us drink the blue
  Transcendent air together
  Then down where the same old works to do
  In the same dull daily weather

  We may not wait    yet look below
  How part On this keen ridge
  But one may pass They call yougo
  My life shall be your bridge




NoteVesalius the great anatomist studied at Louvain and Paris
and was called by Venice to the chair of surgery in the University
of Padua He was one of the first physiologists to dissect the human
body and his great work The Structure of the Human Body was an
open attack on the physiology of Galen The book excited such
violent opposition not only in the Church but in the University
that in a fit of discouragement he burned his remaining manuscripts
and accepted the post of physician at the Court of Charles V and
afterward of his son Philip II of Spain This closed his life of
free enquiry for the Inquisition forbade all scientific research
and the dissection of corpses was prohibited in Spain Vesalius led
for many years the life of the rich and successful court physician
but regrets for his past were never wholly extinguished and in 
they were roused afresh by the reading of an anatomical treatise by
Gabriel Fallopius his successor in the chair at Padua From that
moment life in Spain became intolerable to Vesalius and in  he
set out for the East Tradition reports that this journey was a
penance to which the Church condemned him for having opened the body
of a woman before she was actually dead but more probably Vesalius
sick of his long servitude made the pilgrimage a pretext to escape
from Spain

Fallopius had meanwhile died and the Venetian Senate is said to
have offered Vesalius his old chair but on the way home from
Jerusalem he was seized with illness and died at Zante in
