      Now when it was the Seven Hundred and Seventyseventh Night

She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the old
Queen heard the handmaids words she was wroth with sore wrath because
of her and cried How shall there be accord between man and Jinn But
Sayf alMuluk replied Indeed I will conform to thy will and be thy
page and die in thy love and will keep with thee covenant and regard
none but thee so right soon shalt thou see my truth and lack of
falsehood and the excellence of my manly dealing with thee Inshallah
The old woman pondered for a full hour with brow earthwards bent after
which she raised her head and said to him O thou beautiful youth wilt
thou indeed keep compact and covenant He replied Yes by Him who
raised the heavens and dispread the earth upon the waters I will indeed
keep faith and troth Thereupon quoth she I will win for thee thy
wish Inshallah but for the present go thou into the garden and take
thy pleasure therein and eat of its fruits that have neither like in
the world nor equal whilst I send for my son Shahyal and confabulate
with him of the matter Nothing but good shall come of it so Allah
please for he will not gainsay me nor disobey my commandment and I will
marry thee with his daughter Badia alJamal So be of good heart for
she shall assuredly be thy wife O Sayf alMuluk The Prince thanked
her for those words and kissing her hands and feet went forth from her
into the garden whilst she turned to Marjanah and said to her Go seek
my son Shahyal wherever he is and bring him to me So Marjanah went out
in quest of King Shahyal and found him and set him before his mother On
such wise fared it with them but as regards Sayf alMuluk whilst he
walked in the garden lo and behold five Jinn of the people of the Blue
King espied him and said to one another Whence cometh yonder wight and
who brought him hither Haply tis he who slew the son and heir of our
lord and master the Blue King presently adding But we will go about
with him and question him and find out all from him So they walked
gently and softly up to him as he sat in a corner of the garden and
sitting down by him said to him O beauteous youth thou didst right
well in slaying the son of the Blue King and delivering from him Daulat
Khatun for he was a treacherous hound and had tricked her and had not
Allah appointed thee to her she had never won free no never But how
diddest thou slay him Sayf alMuluk looked at them and deeming them of
the gardenfolk answered I slew him by means of this ring which is on
my finger Therewith they were assured that it was he who had slain
him so they seized him two of them holding his hands whilst other two
held his feet and the fifth his mouth lest he should cry out and King
Shahyals people should hear him and rescue him from their hands Then
they lifted him up and flying away with him ceased not their flight till
they came to their King and set him down before him saying O King of
the Age we bring thee the murderer of thy son Where is he asked
the King and they answered This is he So the Blue King said to Sayf
alMuluk How slewest thou my son the core of my heart and the light
of my sight without aught of right for all he had done thee no ill
deed Quoth the Prince Yea verily I slew him because of his
violence and frowardness in that he used to seize Kings daughters and
sever them from their families and carry them to the Ruined Well and the
Highbuilded Castle of Japhet son of Noah and entreat them lewdly by
debauching them I slew him by means of this ring on my finger and
Allah hurried his soul to the fire and the abidingplace dire
Therewithal the King was assured that this was indeed he who slew his
son so presently he called his Wazirs and said to them This is the
murtherer of my son sans shadow of doubt so how do you counsel me to
deal with him Shall I slay him with the foulest slaughter or torture
him with the terriblest torments or how Quoth the Chief Minister Cut
off his limbs one a day Another Beat him with a grievous beating
every day till he die A third Cut him across the middle A fourth
Chop off all his fingers and burn him with fire A fifth Crucify
him and so on each speaking according to his rede Now there was with
the Blue King an old Emir versed in the vicissitudes and experienced in
the exchanges of the times and he said O King of the Age verily I
would say to thee somewhat and thine is the rede whether thou wilt
hearken or not to my say Now he was the Kings privy Councillor and
the Chief Officer of his empire and the sovran was wont to give ear to
his word and conduct himself by his counsel and gainsay him not in
aught So he rose and kissing ground before his liege lord said to him
O King of the Age if I advise thee in this matter wilt thou follow my
advice and grant me indemnity Quoth the King Set forth thine
opinion and thou shalt have immunity Then quoth he O King of the
Age an thou slay this one nor accept my advice nor hearken to my word
in very sooth I say that his death were now inexpedient for that he is
thy prisoner and in thy power and under thy protection so whenas thou
wilt thou mayst lay hand on him and do with him what thou desirest
Have patience then O King of the Age for he hath entered the garden
of Iram and is become the betrothed of Badia alJamal daughter of King
Shahyal and one of them Thy people seized him there and brought him
hither and he did not hide his case from them or from thee So an thou
slay him assuredly King Shahyal will seek bloodrevenge and lead his
host against thee for his daughters sake and thou canst not cope with
him nor make head against his power So the King hearkened to his
counsel and commanded to imprison the captive Thus fared it with Sayf
alMuluk but as regards the old Queen grandmother of Badia alJamal
when her son Shahyal came to her she despatched Marjanah in search of
Sayf alMuluk but she found him not and returning to her mistress
said I found him not in the garden So the ancient dame sent for the
gardeners and questioned them of the Prince Quoth they We saw him
sitting under a tree when behold five of the Blue Kings folk alighted
by him and spoke with him after which they took him up and having
gagged him flew away with him When the old Queen heard the damsels
words it was no light matter to her and she was wroth with exceeding
wrath so she rose to her feet and said to her son King Shahyal Art a
King and shall the Blue Kings people come to our garden and carry off
our guests unhindered and thou alive And she proceeded to provoke
him saying It behoveth not that any transgress against us during
thy lifetime Answered he O mother of me this man slew the Blue
Kings son who was a Jinni and Allah threw him into his hand He is a
Jinni and I am a Jinni how then shall I go to him and make war on him
for the sake of a mortal But she rejoined Go to him and demand our
guest of him and if he be still alive and the Blue King deliver him to
thee take him and return but an he have slain him take the King and
all his children and Hiram and household depending on him then bring
them to me alive that I may cut their throats with my own hand and lay
in ruins his reign Except thou go to him and do my bidding I will not
acquit thee of my milk and my rearing of thee shall be counted
unlawfulAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say
her permitted say


      Now when it was the Seven Hundred and Seventyeighth Night

She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the grandmother of
Badia alJamal said to Shahyal Fare thee to the Blue King and look
after Sayf alMuluk if he be still in life come with him hither but an
he have slain him take that King and all his children and Harim and the
whole of his dependents and protgs and bring them here alive that I
may cut their throats with my own hand and ruin his realm Except thou
go to him and do my bidding I will not acquit thee of my milk and my
rearing of thee shall be accounted unlawful Thereupon Shahyal rose and
assembling his troops set out in deference to his mother desiring to
content her and her friends and in accordance with whatso had been
foreordained from eternity without beginning nor did they leave
journeying till they came to the land of the Blue King who met them
with his army and gave them battle The Blue Kings host was put to the
rout and the conquerors having taken him and all his sons great and
small and Grandees and officers bound and brought them before King
Shahyal who said to the captive O Azrak where is the mortal Sayf
alMuluk who whilome was my guest Answered the Blue King O Shahyal
thou art a Jinni and I am a Jinni and ist on account of a mortal who
slew my son that thou hast done this deed yea the murtherer of my son
the core of my liver and solace of my soul How couldest thou work such
work and spill the blood of so many thousand Jinn He replied Leave
this talk Knowest thou not that a single mortal is better in Allahs
sight than a thousand Jinn If he be alive bring him to me and I
will set thee free and all whom I have taken of thy sons and people but
an thou have slain him I will slaughter thee and thy sons Quoth the
Malik alAzrak O King is this man of more account with thee than my
son and quoth Shahyal Verily thy son was an evildoer who kidnapped
Kings daughters and shut them up in the Ruined Well and the
Highbuilded Castle of Japhet son of Noah and entreated them lewdly
Then said the Blue King He is with me but make thou peace between
us So he delivered the Prince to Shahyal who made peace between him
and the Blue King and AlAzrak gave him a bond of absolution for the
death of his son Then Shahyal conferred robes of honour on them and
entertained the Blue King and his troops hospitably for three days
after which he took Sayf alMuluk and carried him back to the old Queen
his own mother who rejoiced in him with an exceeding joy and Shahyal
marvelled at the beauty of the Prince and his loveliness and his
perfection Then the Prince related to him his story from beginning to
end especially what did befel him with Badia alJamal and Shahyal
said O my mother since tis thy pleasure that this should be I hear
and I obey all that to command it pleaseth thee wherefore do thou take
him and bear him to Sarandib and there celebrate his wedding and marry
him to her in all state for he is a goodly youth and hath endured
horrors for her sake So she and her maidens set out with Sayf alMuluk
for Sarandib and entering the Garden belonging to the Queen of Hind
foregathered with Daulat Khatun and Badia alJamal Then the lovers
met and the old Queen acquainted the two Princesses with all that had
passed between Sayf alMuluk and the Blue King and how the Prince had
been nearhand to a captives death but in repetition is no fruition
Then King Taj alMuluk father of Daulat Khatun assembled the lords of
his land and drew up the contract of marriage between Sayf alMuluk and
Badia alJamal and he conferred costly robes of honour and gave
banquets to the lieges Then Sayf alMuluk rose and kissing ground
before the King said to him O King pardon I would fain ask of thee
somewhat but I fear lest thou refuse it to my disappointment Taj
alMuluk replied By Allah though thou soughtest my soul of me I
would not refuse it to thee after all the kindness thou hast done me
Quoth Sayf alMuluk I wish thee to marry the Princess Daulat Khatun to
my brother Said and we will both be thy pages I hear and obey
answered Taj alMuluk and assembling his Grandees a second time let
draw up the contract of marriage between his daughter and Said after
which they scattered gold and silver and the King bade decorate the
city So they held high festival and Sayf alMuluk went in unto Badia
alJamal and Said went in unto Daulat Khatun on the same night
Moreover Sayf alMuluk abode forty days with Badia alJamal at the end
of which she said to him O Kings son say me is there left in thy
heart any regret for aught And he replied Allah forfend I have
accomplished my quest and there abideth no regret in my heart at all
but I would fain meet my father and my mother in the land of Egypt and
see if they continue in welfare or not So she commanded a company of
her slaves to convey them to Egypt and they carried them to Cairo
where Sayf alMuluk and Said foregathered with their parents and abode
with them a week after which they took leave of them and returned to
Sarandibcity and from this time forwards whenever they longed for
their folk they used to go to them and return Then Sayf alMuluk and
Badia alJamal abode in all solace of life and its joyance as did Said
and Daulat Khatun till there came to them the Destroyer of delights and
Severer of Societies and they all died good Moslems So glory be to the
Living One who dieth not who createth all creatures and decreeth to
them death and who is the First without beginning and the Last
without end This is all that hath come down to us of the story of Sayf
alMuluk and Badia alJamal And Allah alone wotteth the truth But
not less excellent than this tale is the History of

                         HASAN OF BASSORAH


There was once of days of yore and in ages and times long gone before a
merchant who dwelt in the land of Bassorah and who owned two sons and
wealth galore But in due time Allah the Allhearing the Allknowing
decreed that he should be admitted to the mercy of the Most High so he
died and his two sons laid him out and buried him after which they
divided his gardens and estates equally between them and of his portion
each one opened a shop Presently the elder son Hasan hight a youth
of passing beauty and loveliness symmetry and perfect grace betook
himself to the company of lewd folk women and low boys frolicking with
them in gardens and feasting them with meat and wine for months together
and occupying himself not with his business like as his father had done
for that he exulted in the abundance of his good After some time he had
wasted all his ready money so he sold all his fathers lands and houses
and played the wastrel until there remained in his hand nothing neither
little nor muchel nor was one of his comrades left who knew him He
abode thus anhungred he and his widowed mother three days and on the
fourth day as he walked along unknowing whither to wend there met him
a man of his fathers friends who questioned him of his case He told
him what had befallen him and the other said O my son I have a
brother who is a goldsmith an thou wilt thou shalt be with him and
learn his craft and become skilled therein Hasan consented and
accompanied him to his brother to whom he commended him saying In
very sooth this is my son do thou teach him for my sake So Hasan
abode with the goldsmith and busied himself with the craft and Allah
opened to him the door of gain and in due course he set up shop for
himself One day as he sat in his booth in the bazar there came up to
him an Ajam a foreigner a Persian with a great white beard and a
white turband on his head having the semblance of a merchant who
after saluting him looked at his handiwork and examined it knowingly
It pleased him and he shook his head saying By Allah thou art a
cunning goldsmith What may be thy name Hasan replied the other
shortly The Persian continued to look at his wares whilst Hasan
read in an old book he hent in hand and the folk were taken up with
his beauty and loveliness and symmetry and perfect grace till the hour
of midafternoon prayer when the shop became clear of people and the
Persian accosted the young man saying O my son thou art a comely
youth What book is that Thou hast no sire and I have no son and I
know an art than which there is no goodlier in the worldAnd
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say


       Now when it was the Seven Hundred and Seventyninth Night

She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Persian
accosted the young man saying O my son thou art a comely youth Thou
hast no sire and I have no son and I know an art than which there is no
goodlier in the world Many have sought of me instruction therein but I
consented not to instruct any of them in it yet hath my soul consented
that I teach it to thee for thy love hath gotten hold upon my heart and
I will make thee my son and set up between thee and poverty a barrier
so shalt thou be quit of this handicraft and toil no more with hammer
and anvil charcoal and fire Hasan asked O my lord and when wilt
thou teach me this and the Persian answered Tomorrow Inshallah I
will come to thee betimes and make thee in thy presence fine gold of
this copper Whereupon Hasan rejoiced and sat talking with the Persian
till nightfall when he took leave of him and going in to his mother
saluted her with the salam and ate with her but he was dazed without
memory or reason for that the strangers words had gotten hold upon his
heart So she questioned him and he told her what had passed between
himself and the Persian which when she heard her heart fluttered and
she strained him to her bosom saying O my son beware of hearkening
to the talk of the folk and especially of the Persians and obey them
not in aught for they are sharpers and tricksters who profess the art
of alchemy and swindle people and take their money and devour it in
vain Replied Hasan O my mother we are paupers and have nothing he
may covet that he should put a cheat on us Indeed this Persian is a
right worthy Shaykh and the signs of virtue are manifest on him Allah
hath inclined his heart to me and he hath adopted me to son She was
silent in her chagrin and he passed the night without sleep his heart
being full of what the Persian had said to him nor did slumber visit
him for the excess of his joy therein But when morning morrowed he
rose and taking the keys opened the shop whereupon behold the Persian
accosted him Hasan stood up to him and would have kissed his hands but
he forbade him from this and suffered it not saying O Hasan set on
the crucible and apply the bellows So he did as the stranger bade
him and lighted the charcoal Then said the Persian O my son hast
thou any copper and he replied I have a broken platter So he bade
him work the shears and cut it into bittocks and cast it into the
crucible and blow up the fire with the bellows till the copper became
liquid when he put hand to turband and took therefrom a folded paper
and opening it sprinkled thereout into the pot about half a drachm of
somewhat like yellow Kohl or eyepowder Then he bade Hasan blow
upon it with the bellows and he did so till the contents of the
crucible became a lump of gold When the youth saw this he was
stupefied and at his wits end for the joy he felt and taking the ingot
from the crucible handled it and tried it with the file and found it
pure gold of the finest quality whereupon his reason fled and he was
dazed with excess of delight and bent over the Persians hand to kiss
it But he forbade him saying Art thou married and when the youth
replied No he said Carry this ingot to the market and sell it and
take the price in haste and speak not So Hasan went down into the
market and gave the bar to the broker who took it and rubbed it upon
the touchstone and found it pure gold So they opened the biddings at
ten thousand dirhams and the merchants bid against one another for it up
to fifteen thousand dirhams at which price he sold it and taking
the money went home and told his mother all that had passed saying O
my mother I have learnt this art and mystery But she laughed at him
saying There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the
Glorious the GreatAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased to say her permitted say


         Now when it was the Seven Hundred and Eightieth Night

She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Hasan
the goldsmith told his mother what he had done with the Ajami and cried
I have learnt this art and mystery she laughed at him saying There
is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the Glorious the
Great and she was silent for vexation Then of his ignorance he took
a metal mortar and returning to the shop laid it before the Persian
who was still sitting there and who asked him O my son what wilt thou
do with this mortar Hasan answered Let us put it in the fire and
make of it lumps of gold The Persian laughed and rejoined O my son
art thou Jinnmad that thou wouldst go down into the market with two
ingots of gold in one day Knowest thou not that the folk would suspect
us and our lives would be lost Now O my son an I teach thee this
craft thou must practise it but once in each twelvemonth for that will
suffice thee from year to year Cried Hasan True O my lord and
sitting down in his open shop set on the crucible and cast more
charcoal on the fire Quoth the Persian What wilt thou O my son
and quoth Hasan Teach me this craft There is no Majesty and there
is no Might save in Allah the Glorious the Great exclaimed the
Persian laughing Verily O my son thou art little of wit and in
nowise fitted for this noble craft Did ever any during all his life
learn this art on the beaten way or in the bazars If we busy ourselves
with it here the folk will say of us These practise alchemy and the
magistrates will hear of us and we shall lose our lives Wherefore
O my son an thou desire to learn this mystery forthright come thou
with me to my house So Hasan barred his shop and went with that Ajami
but by the way he remembered his mothers words and thinking in himself
a thousand thoughts he stood still with bowed head The Persian turned
and seeing him thus standing laughed and said to him Art thou mad
What I in my heart purpose thee good and thou misdoubtest I will harm
thee presently adding But if thou fear to go with me to my house I
will go with thee to thine and teach thee there Hasan replied Tis
well O uncle and the Persian rejoined Go thou before me So Hasan
led the way to his own house and entering told his mother of the
Persians coming for he had left him standing at the door She ordered
the house for them and when she had made an end of furnishing and
adorning it her son bade her go to one of the neighbours lodgings So
she left her home to them and wended her way whereupon Hasan brought in
the Persian who entered after asking leave Then he took in hand a dish
and going to the market returned with food which he set before the
Persian saying Eat O my lord that between us there may be bread and
salt and may Almighty Allah do vengeance upon the traitor to bread and
salt The Persian replied with a smile True O my son Who knoweth
the virtue and worth of bread and salt Then he came forward and
ate with Hasan till they were satisfied after which the Ajami said O
my son Hasan bring us somewhat of sweetmeats So Hasan went to the
market rejoicing in his words and returned with ten saucers of
sweetmeats of which they both ate and the Persian said May Allah
abundantly requite thee O my son It is the like of thee with whom folk
company and to whom they discover their secrets and teach what may
profit him Then said he O Hasan bring the gear But hardly did
Hasan hear these words than he went forth like a colt let out to grass
in springtide and hastening to the shop fetched the apparatus and set
it before the Persian who pulled out a piece of paper and said O
Hasan by the bond of bread and salt wert thou not dearer to me than my
son I would not let thee into the mysteries of this art for I have
none of the Elixir left save what is in this paper but by and by I
will compound the simples whereof it is composed and will make it before
thee Know O my son Hasan that to every ten pounds of copper thou must
set half a drachm of that which is in this paper and the whole ten will
presently become unalloyed virgin gold presently adding O my son O
Hasan there are in this paper three ounces Egyptian measure and
when it is spent I will make thee other and more Hasan took the
packet and finding therein a yellow powder finer than the first said
to the Persian O my lord what is the name of this substance and where
is it found and how is it made But he laughed longing to get hold of
the youth and replied Of what dost thou question Indeed thou art a
froward boy Do thy work and hold thy peace So Hasan arose and
fetching a brass platter from the house shore it in shreds and threw it
into the meltingpot then he scattered on it a little of the powder
from the paper and it became a lump of pure gold When he saw this he
joyed with exceeding joy and was filled with amazement and could think
of nothing save the gold but whilst he was occupied with taking up the
lumps of metal from the meltingpot the Persian pulled out of his
turband in haste a packet of Cretan Bhang which if an elephant smelt
he would sleep from night to night and cutting off a little thereof
put it in a piece of the sweetmeat Then said he O Hasan thou art
become my very son and dearer to me than soul and wealth and I have a
daughter whose like never have eyes beheld for beauty and loveliness
symmetry and perfect grace Now I see that thou befittest none but her
and she none but thee wherefore if it be Allahs will I will marry
thee to her Replied Hasan I am thy servant and whatso good thou dost
with me will be a deposit with the Almighty and the Persian rejoined
O my son have fair patience and fair shall betide thee Therewith he
gave him the piece of sweetmeat and he took it and kissing his hand put
it in his mouth knowing not what was hidden for him in the after time
for only the Lord of Futurity knoweth the Future But hardly had he
swallowed it when he fell down head foregoing heels and was lost to
the world whereupon the Persian seeing him in such calamitous case
rejoiced exceedingly and cried Thou has fallen into my snares O
gallowscarrion O dog of the Arabs This many a year have I sought thee
and now I have found thee O HasanAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn
of day and ceased saying her permitted say


       Now when it was the Seven Hundred and Eightyfirst Night

She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Hasan the
goldsmith ate the bit of sweetmeat given to him by the Ajami and fell
fainting to the ground the Persian rejoiced exceedingly and cried
This many a year have I sought thee and now I have found thee Then he
girt himself and pinioned Hasans arms and binding his feet to his hands
laid him in a chest which he emptied to that end and locked it upon
him Moreover he cleared another chest and laying therein all Hasans
valuables together with the piece of the first goldlump and the second
ingot which he had made locked it with a padlock Then he ran to the
market and fetching a porter took up the two chests and made off with
them to a place within sight of the city where he set them down on the
seashore hard by a vessel at anchor there Now this craft had been
freighted and fitted out by the Persian and her master was awaiting him
so when the crew saw him they came to him and bore the two chests on
board Then the Persian called out to the Rais or Captain saying Up
and let us be off for I have done my desire and won my wish So the
skipper sang out to the sailors saying Weigh anchor and set sail
And the ship put out to sea with a fair wind So far concerning the
Persian but as regards Hasans mother she awaited him till suppertime
but heard neither sound nor news of him so she went to the house and
finding it thrown open entered and saw none therein and missed the two
chests and their valuables wherefore she knew that her son was lost and
that doom had overtaken him and she buffeted her face and rent her
raiment crying out and wailing and saying Alas my son ah Alas the
fruit of my vitals ah And she recited these couplets

 My patience fails me and grows anxiety  And with your absence growth
    of grief I see
 By Allah Patience went what time ye went  Loss of all Hope how suffer
    patiently
 When lost my loved one how can joy I sleep  Who shall enjoy such life
    of low degree
 Thourt gone and desolating house and home  Hast fouled the fount
    erst flowed from foulness free
 Thou wast my fame my grace mid folk my stay  Mine aid wast thou in
    all adversity
 Perish the day when from mine eyes they bore  My friend till sight I
    thy return to me

And she ceased not to weep and wail till the dawn when the neighbours
came in to her and asked her of her son and she told them what had
befallen him with the Persian assured that she should never never see
him again Then she went round about the house weeping and wending she
espied two lines written upon the wall so she sent for a scholar who
read them to her and they were these

 Leylas phantom came by night when drowsiness had overcome me towards
    morning while my companions were sleeping in the desert
 But when we awoke to behold the nightly phantom I saw the air vacant
    and the place of visitation was distant

When Hasans mother heard these lines she shrieked and said Yes O my
son Indeed the house is desolate and the visitationplace is distant
Then the neighbours took leave of her and after they had prayed that she
might be vouchsafed patience and speedy reunion with her son went away
but she ceased not to weep all watches of the night and tides of the day
and she built amiddlemost the house a tomb whereon she let write Hasans
name and the date of his loss and thenceforward she quitted it not but
made a habit of incessantly biding thereby night and day Such was her
case but touching her son Hasan and the Ajami this Persian was a
Magian who hated Moslems with exceeding hatred and destroyed all who
fell into his power He was a lewd and filthy villain a hankerer after
alchemy an astrologer and a hunter of hidden hoards such an one as he
of whom quoth the poet

 A dog dogfathered by doggrandsire bred  No good in dog from dog
    race issued
 Een for a gnat no restingplace gives he  Who is composed of seed by
    all men shed

The name of this accursed was Bahrm the Guebre and he was wont every
year to take a Moslem and cut his throat for his own purposes So when
he had carried out his plot against Hasan the goldsmith they sailed on
from dawn till dark when the ship made fast to the shore for the night
and at sunrise when they set sail again Bahram bade his black slaves
and white servants bring him the chest wherein were Hasan They did so
and he opened it and taking out the young man made him sniff up vinegar
and blew a powder into his nostrils Hasan sneezed and vomited the
Bhang then opening his eyes he looked about him right and left and
found himself amiddleward the sea on aboard a ship in full sail and saw
the Persian sitting by him wherefore he knew that the accursed Magian
had put a cheat on him and that he had fallen into the very peril
against which his mother had warned him So he spake the saying which
shall never shame the sayer to wit There is no Majesty and there is
no Might save in Allah the Glorious the Great Verily we are Allahs
and unto Him we are returning O my God be Thou gracious to me in Thine
appointment and give me patience to endure this Thine affliction O Lord
of the three Worlds Then he turned to the Persian and bespoke him
softly saying O my father what fashion is this and where is the
covenant of bread and salt and the oath thou swarest to me But Bahram
stared at him and replied O dog knoweth the like of me bond of bread
and salt I have slain of youths like thee a thousand save one and
thou shalt make up the thousand And he cried out at him and Hasan was
silent knowing that the Fateshaft had shot himAnd Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say


       Now when it was the Seven Hundred and Eightysecond Night

She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Hasan
beheld himself fallen into the hands of the damned Persian he bespoke
him softly but gained naught thereby for the Ajami cried out at him in
wrath so he was silent knowing that the Fateshaft had shot him Then
the accursed bade loose his pinionbonds and they gave him a little
water to drink whilst the Magian laughed and said By the virtue of
the Fire and the Light and the Shade and the Heat methought not thou
wouldst fall into my nets But the Fire empowered me over thee and
helped me to lay hold upon thee that I might win my wish and return and
make thee a sacrifice to her so she may accept of me Quoth
Hasan Thou hast foully betrayed bread and salt whereupon the Magus
raised his hand and dealt him such a buffet that he fell and biting the
deck with his foreteeth swooned away whilst the tears trickled down
his cheeks Then the Guebre bade his servants light him a fire and Hasan
said What wilt thou do with it Replied the Magian This is the
Fire lady of light and sparkles bright This it is I worship and if
thou wilt worship her even as I verily I will give thee half my monies
and marry thee to my maiden daughter Thereupon Hasan cried angrily at
him Woe to thee Thou art a miscreant Magian who to Fire dost pray in
lieu of the King of Omnipotent sway Creator of Night and Day and this
is naught but a calamity among creeds At this the Magian was wroth and
said to him Wilt thou not then conform with me O dog of the Arabs
and enter my faith But Hasan consented not to this so the accursed
Guebre arose and prostrating himself to the fire bade his pages throw
him flat on his face They did so and he beat him with a hide whip of
plaited thongs till his flanks were laid open whilst he cried aloud
for aid but none aided him and besought protection but none protected
him Then he raised his eyes to the Allpowerful King and sought of Him
succour in the name of the Chosen Prophet And indeed patience failed
him his tears ran down his cheeks like rain and he repeated these
couplets twain

 In patience O my God Thy doom forecast  Ill bear an thereby come
    Thy grace at last
 Theyve dealt us wrong transgressed and ordered ill  Haply Thy Grace
    shall pardon what is past

Then the Magian bade his negroslaves raise him to a sitting posture and
bring him somewhat of meat and drink So they sat food before him but
he consented not to eat or drink and Bahram ceased not to torment him
day and night during the whole voyage whilst Hasan took patience and
humbled himself in supplication before Almighty Allah to whom belong
Honour and Glory whereby the Guebres heart was hardened against him
They ceased not to sail the sea three months during which time Hasan
was continually tortured till Allah Almighty sent forth upon them a foul
wind and the sea grew black and rose against the ship by reason of the
fierce gale whereupon quoth the captain and crew By Allah this
is all on account of yonder youth who hath been these three months in
torture with this Magian Indeed this is not allowed of God the Most
High Then they rose against the Magian and slew his servants and all
who were with him which when he saw he made sure of death and feared
for himself So he loosed Hasan from his bonds and pulling off the
ragged clothes the youth had on clad him in others and made excuses to
him and promised to teach him the craft and restore him to his native
land saying O my son return me not evil for that I have done with
thee Quoth Hasan How can I ever rely upon thee again and quoth
Bahram O my son but for sin there were no pardon Indeed I did all
these doings with thee but to try thy patience and thou knowest that
the case is altogether in the hands of Allah So the crew and captain
rejoiced in Hasans release and he called down blessings on them and
praised the Almighty and thanked Him With this the wind was stilled and
the sky cleared and with a fair breeze they continued their voyage Then
said Hasan to Bahram O Master whither wendest thou Replied the
Magian O my son I am bound for the Mountain of Clouds where is the
Elixir which we use in alchemy And the Guebre swore to him by the Fire
and the Light that he had no longer any cause to fear him So Hasans
heart was set at ease and rejoicing at the Persians words he continued
to eat and drink and sleep with the Magian who clad him in his own
raiment They ceased not sailing on other three months when the ship
came to anchor off a long shoreline of manycoloured pebbles white and
yellow and skyblue and black and every other hue and the Magian sprang
up and said O Hasan come let us go ashore for we have reached the
place of our wish and will So Hasan rose and landed with Bahram after
the Persian had commended his goods to the captains care They walked
on inland till they were far enough from the ship to be out of sight
when Bahram sat down and taking from his pocket a kettledrum of
copper and a silken strap worked in gold with characts beat the drum
with the strap until there arose a cloud of dust from the further side
of the waste Hasan marvelled at the Magians doings and was afraid of
him he repented of having come ashore with him and his colour changed
But Bahram looked at him and said What aileth thee O my son By the
truth of the Fire and the Light thou hast naught to fear from me and
were it not that my wish may never be won save by thy means I had not
brought thee ashore So rejoice in all good for yonder cloud of dust is
the dust of somewhat we will mount and which will aid us to cut across
this wold and make easy to us the hardships thereofAnd Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say


       Now when it was the Seven Hundred and Eightythird Night

She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Persian
said to Hasan In very sooth yonder dustcloud is the cloud of
something we will mount and which will aid us to cut across this wold
and will make easy to us the hardships thereof Presently the dust
lifted off three shedromedaries one of which Bahram mounted and Hasan
another Then they loaded their victual on the third and fared on seven
days till they came to a wide champaign and descending into its midst
they saw a dome vaulted upon four pilasters of red gold so they
alighted and entering thereunder ate and drank and took their rest
Anon Hasan chanced to glance aside and seeing from afar a something
lofty said to the Magian What is that O nuncle Bahram replied
Tis a palace and quoth Hasan Wilt thou not go thither that we may
enter and there repose ourselves and solace ourselves with inspecting
it But the Persian was wroth and said Name not to me yonder palace
for therein dwelleth a foe with whom there befel me somewhat whereof
this is no time to tell thee Then he beat the kettledrum and up came
the dromedaries and they mounted and fared on other seven days On the
eighth day the Magian said O Hasan what seest thou Hasan replied
I see clouds and mists twixt east and west Quoth Bahram That is
neither clouds nor mists but a vast mountain and a lofty whereon the
clouds split and there are no clouds above it for its exceeding
height and surpassing elevation Yon mount is my goal and thereon is the
need we seek Tis for that I brought thee hither for my wish may not
be won save at thy hands Hasan hearing this gave his life up for lost
and said to the Magian By the right of that thou worshippest and by
the faith wherein thou believest I conjure thee to tell me what is the
object wherefor thou hast brought me Bahram replied The art of
alchemy may not be accomplished save by means of a herb which groweth in
the place where the clouds pass and whereon they split Such a site is
yonder mountain upon whose head the herb groweth and I purpose to send
thee up thither to fetch it and when we have it I will show thee the
secret of this craft which thou desirest to learn Hasan answered in
his fear Tis well O my master and indeed he despaired of life and
wept for his parting from his parent and people and patrial stead
repenting him of having gainsaid his mother and reciting these two
couplets

 Consider but thy Lord His work shall bring  Comfort to thee with
    quick relief and near
 Despair not when thou sufferest sorest bane  In bane how many blessed
    boons appear

They ceased not faring on till they came to the foothills of that
mountain where they halted and Hasan saw thereon a palace and asked
Bahram What be yonder palace whereto he answered Tis the abode
of the Jann and Ghuls and Satans Then the Magian alighted and making
Hasan also dismount from his dromedary kissed his head and said to him
Bear me no ill will anent that I did with thee for I will keep guard
over thee in thine ascent to the palace and I conjure thee not to trick
and cheat me of aught thou shalt bring therefrom and I and thou will
share equally therein And Hasan replied To hear is to obey Then
Bahram opened a bag and taking out a handmill and a sufficiency of
wheat ground the grain and kneaded three round cakes of the flour
after which he lighted a fire and baked the bannocks Then he took out
the copper kettledrum and beat it with the broidered strap whereupon
up came the dromedaries He chose out one and said Hearken O my son
O Hasan to what I am about to enjoin on thee and Hasan replied Tis
well Bahram continued Lie down on this skin and I will sew thee up
therein and lay thee on the ground whereupon the Rakham birds will
come to thee and carry thee up to the mountaintop Take this knife with
thee and when thou feelest that the birds have done flying and have
set thee down slit open therewith the skin and come forth The vultures
will then take fright at thee and fly away whereupon do thou look down
from the mountain head and speak to me and I will tell thee what to
do So he sewed him up in the skin placing therein three cakes and a
leathern bottle full of water and withdrew to a distance Presently a
vulture pounced upon him and taking him up flew away with him to the
mountaintop and there set him down As soon as Hasan felt himself on
the ground he slit the skin and coming forth called out to the Magian
who hearing his speech rejoiced and danced for excess of joy saying to
him Look behind thee and tell me what thou seest Hasan looked and
seeing many rotten bones and much wood told Bahram who said to him
This be what we need and seek Make six bundles of the wood and throw
them down to me for this is wherewithal we do alchemy So he threw him
the six bundles and when he had gotten them into his power he said to
Hasan O gallows bird I have won my wish of thee and now if thou
wilt thou mayst abide on this mountain or cast thyself down to the
earth and perish So saying he left him and went away and Hasan
exclaimed There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the
Glorious the Great This hound hath played the traitor with me And he
sat bemoaning himself and reciting these couplets

 When God upon a man possessed of reasoning Hearing and sight His will
    in aught to pass would bring
 He stops his ears and blinds his eyes and draws his wit From him as
    one draws out the hairs to paste that cling
 Till His decrees fulfilled He gives him back His wit That therewithal
    he may receive admonishing
 So say thou not of aught that haps How happened it For Fate and
    fortune fixed do order everything

And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her
permitted say


       Now when it was the Seven Hundred and Eightyfourth Night

She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the Magian
sent Hasan to the mountaintop and made him throw down all he required
he presently reviled him and left him and wended his ways and the youth
exclaimed There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the
Glorious the Great This damned hound hath played the traitor Then he
rose to his feet and looked right and left after which he walked on
along the mountain top in mind making certain of death He fared on
thus till he came to the counterslope of the mountain along which he
saw a darkblue sea dashing with billows clashing and yeasting waves
each as it were a lofty mount So he sat down and repeated what he might
of the Koran and besought Allah the Most High to ease him of his
troubles or by death or by deliverance from such strait Then he
recited for himself the funeralprayer and cast himself down into
the main but the waves bore him up by Allahs grace so that he
reached the water unhurt and the angel in whose charge is the sea
watched over him so that the billows bore him safe to land by the
decree of the Most High Thereupon he rejoiced and praised Almighty
Allah and thanked Him after which he walked on in quest of something to
eat for stress of hunger and came presently to the place where he had
halted with the Magian Bahram Then he fared on awhile till behold he
caught sight of a great palace rising high in air and knew it for that
of which he had questioned the Persian and he had replied Therein
dwelleth a foe of mine Hasan said to himself By Allah needs must I
enter yonder palace perchance relief awaiteth me there So coming to
it and finding the gate open he entered the vestibule where he saw
seated on a bench two girls like twin moons with a chesscloth before
them and they were at play One of them raised her head to him and cried
out for joy saying By Allah here is a son of Adam and methinks tis
he whom Bahram the Magian brought hither this year So Hasan hearing
her words cast himself at their feet and wept with sore weeping and
said Yes O my ladies by Allah I am indeed that unhappy Then said
the younger damsel to her elder sister Bear witness against me O
my sister that this is my brother by covenant of Allah and that I will
die for his death and live for his life and joy for his joy and mourn
for his mourning So saying she rose and embraced him and kissed him
and presently taking him by the hand and her sister with her led him
into the palace where she did off his ragged clothes and brought him a
suit of Kings raiment wherewith she arrayed him Moreover she made
ready all manner viands and set them before him and sat and ate
with him she and her sister Then said they to him Tell us thy tale
with yonder dog the wicked the wizard from the time of thy falling
into his hands to that of thy freeing thee from him and after we will
tell thee all that hath passed between us and him so thou mayst be on
thy guard against him an thou see him again Hearing these words and
finding himself thus kindly received Hasan took heart of grace and
reason returned to him and he related to them all that had befallen him
with the Magian from first to last Then they asked Didst thou ask him
of this palace and he answered Yes but he saidName it not to me
for it belongeth to Ghuls and Satans At this the two damsels waxed
wroth with exceeding wrath and said Did that Miscreant style us Ghuls
and Satans And Hasan answered Yes Cried the younger sister By
Allah I will assuredly do him die with the foulest death and make him
to lack the wind of the world Quoth Hasan And how wilt thou get at
him to kill him for he is a crafty magician and quoth she He is
in a garden by name AlMushayyad and there is no help but that I
slay him before long Then said her sister Sooth spake Hasan in
everything he hath recounted to us of this cur but now tell him our
tale that all of it may abide in his memory So the younger said to
him Know O my brother that we are the daughters of a King of the
mightiest Kings of the Jann having Marids for troops and guards and
servants and Almighty Allah blessed him with seven daughters by one
wife but of his folly such jealousy and stiffneckedness and pride
beyond compare gat hold upon him that he would not give us in marriage
to any one and summoning his Wazirs and Emirs he said to themCan ye
tell me of any place untrodden by the tread of men and Jinn and
abounding in trees and fruits and rills And quoth they What wilt thou
therewith O King of the Age And quoth he I desire there to lodge my
seven daughters Answered they O King the place for them is the Castle
of the Mountain of Clouds built by an Ifrit of the rebellious Jinn who
revolted from the covenant of our lord Solomon on whom be the Peace
Since his destruction none hath dwelt there nor man nor Jinni for
tis cut off and none may win to it And the Castle is girt about
with trees and fruits and rills and the water running around it is
sweeter than honey and colder than snow none who is afflicted with
leprosy or elephantiasis or what not else drinketh thereof but he is
healed forthright Hearing this our father sent us hither with an
escort of his troops and guards and provided us with all that we need
here When he is minded to ride to us he beateth a kettledrum
whereupon all his hosts present themselves before him and he chooseth
whom he shall ride and dismisseth the rest but when he desireth that
we shall visit him he commandeth his followers the enchanters to
fetch us and carry us to the presence so he may solace himself with our
society and we accomplish our desire of him after which they again
carry us back hither Our five other sisters are gone ahunting in our
desert wherein are wild beasts past compt or calculation and it being
our turn to do this we two abode at home to make ready for them food
Indeed we had besought Allah extolled and exalted be He to vouchsafe
us a son of Adam to cheer us with his company and praised be He who hath
brought thee to us So be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and
clear for no harm shall befal thee Hasan rejoiced and said
Alhamdolillah laud to the Lord who guideth us into the path of
deliverance and inclineth hearts to us Then his sister rose and
taking him by the hand led him into a private chamber where she
brought out to him linen and furniture that no mortal can avail unto
Presently the other damsels returned from hunting and birding and their
sisters acquainted them with Hasans case whereupon they rejoiced in
him and going into him in his chamber saluted him with the salam and
gave him joy of his safety Then he abode with them in all the solace of
life and its joyance riding out with them to the chase and taking his
pleasure with them whilst they entreated him courteously and cheered him
with converse till his sadness ceased from him and he recovered health
and strength and his body waxed stout and fat by dint of fair treatment
and pleasant time among the seven moons in that fair palace with its
gardens and flowers for indeed he led the delightsomest of lives with
the damsels who delighted in him and he yet more in them And they used
to give him drink of the honeydew of their lips these beauties
with the high bosoms adorned with grace and loveliness the perfection
of brilliancy and in shape very symmetry Moreover the youngest Princess
told her sisters how Bahram the Magian had made them of the Ghuls and
Demons and Satans and they sware that they would surely slay him
Next year the accursed Guebre again made his appearance having with him
a handsome young Moslem as he were the moon bound hand and foot and
tormented with grievous tortures and alighted with him below the
palacewalls Now Hasan was sitting under the trees by the side of the
stream and when he espied Bahram his heart fluttered his hue
changed and he smote hand upon handAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn
of day and ceased saying her permitted say


       Now when it was the Seven Hundred and Eightyfifth Night

She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Hasan the
goldsmith saw the Magian his heart fluttered his hue changed and he
smote hand upon hand Then he said to the Princesses O my sisters
help me to the slaughter of this accursed for here he is come back and
in your grasp and he leadeth with him captive a young Moslem of the
sons of the notables whom he is torturing with all manner grievous
torments Lief would I kill him and console my heart of him and by
delivering the young Moslem from his mischief and restoring him to his
country and kith and kin and friends fain would I lay up merit for the
world to come by taking my wreak of him This will be an almsdeed
from you and ye will reap the reward thereof from Almighty Allah We
hear and we obey Allah and thee O our brother O Hasan replied they
and binding chinveils armed themselves and slung on their swords
after which they brought Hasan a steed of the best and equipped him in
panoply and weaponed him with goodly weapons Then they all sallied out
and found the Magian who had slaughtered and skinned a camel illusing
the young Moslem and saying to him Sit thee in this hide So Hasan
came behind him without his knowledge and cried out at him till he was
dazed and amazed Then he came up to him saying Hold thy hand O
accursed O enemy of Allah and foe of the Moslems O dog O traitor O
thou that flame dost obey O thou that walkest in the wicked ones ways
worshipping the fire and the light and swearing by the shade and the
heat Herewith the Magian turned and seeing Hasan thought to wheedle
him and said to him O my son how diddest thou escape and who brought
thee down to earth Hasan replied He delivered me who hath appointed
the taking of thy life to be at my hand and I will torture thee even as
thou torturest me the whole way long O miscreant O atheist thou
hast fallen into the twist and the way thou hast missed and neither
mother shall avail thee nor brother nor friend nor solemn covenant
shall assist thee for thou saidst O accursed Whoso betrayeth bread
and salt may Allah do vengeance upon him And thou hast broken the bond
of bread and salt wherefore the Almighty hath thrown thee into my
grasp and far is thy chance of escape from me Rejoined Bahram By
Allah O my son O Hasan thou art dearer to me than my sprite and the
light of mine eyes But Hasan stepped up to him and hastily smote him
between the shoulders that the sword issued gleaming from his
throattendons and Allah hurried his soul to the fire and abidingplace
dire Then Hasan took the Magians bag and opened it then having taken
out the kettledrum he struck it with the strap whereupon up came the
dromedaries like lightning So he unbound the youth from his bonds and
setting him on one of the camels loaded him another with victual and
water saying Wend whither thou wilt So he departed after
Almighty Allah had thus delivered him from his strait at the hands of
Hasan When the damsels saw their brother slay the Magian they joyed in
him with exceeding joy and gat round him marvelling at his valour and
prowess and thanked him for his deed and gave him joy of his
safety saying O Hasan thou hast done a deed whereby thou hast healed
the burning of him that thirsteth for vengeance and pleased the King of
Omnipotence Then they returned to the palace and he abode with them
eating and drinking and laughing and making merry and indeed his
sojourn with them was joyous to him and he forgot his mother but
while he led with them this goodly life one day behold there arose
from the further side of the desert a great cloud of dust that darkened
the welkin and made towards them When the Princesses saw this they
said to him Rise O Hasan run to thy chamber and conceal thyself or
an thou wilt go down into the garden and hide thyself among the trees
and vines but fear not for no harm shall befal thee So he arose and
entering his chamber locked the door upon himself and lay lurking in
the palace Presently the dust opened out and showed beneath it a great
and conquering host as it were a surging sea coming from the King the
father of the damsels Now when the troops reached the castle the
Princesses received them with all honour and hospitably entertained them
three days after which they questioned them of their case and tidings
and they replied saying We come from the King in quest of you They
asked And what would the King with us and the officers answered
One of the Kings maketh a marriage festival and your father would have
you be present thereat and take your pleasure therewith The damsels
enquired And how long shall we be absent from our place and they
rejoined The time to come and go and to sojourn may be two months
So the Princesses arose and going in to the palace sought Hasan
acquainted him with the case and said to him Verily this place is thy
place and our house is thy house so be of good cheer and keep thine
eyes cool and clear and feel nor grief nor fear for none can come at
thee here but keep a good heart and a glad mind till we return to
thee The keys of our chambers we leave with thee but O our brother
we beseech thee by the bond of brotherhood in very deed not to open
such a door for thou hast no need thereto Then they farewelled him
and fared forth with the troops leaving Hasan alone in the palace It
was not long before his breast grew straitened and his patience
shortened solitude and sadness were heavy on him and he sorrowed for
his severance from them with passing chagrin The palace for all its
vastness waxed small to him and finding himself sad and solitary he
bethought him of the damsels and their pleasant converse and recited
these couplets

 The wide plain is narrowed before these eyes  And the landscape
    troubles this heart of mine
 Since my friends went forth by the loss of them  Joy fled and these
    eyelids rail floods of brine
 Sleep shunned these eyeballs for parting woe  And my mind is worn with
    sore pain and pine
 Would I wot an Time shall rejoin our lots  And the joys of love with
    nighttalk combine

And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her
permitted say


       Now when it was the Seven Hundred and Eightysixth Night

She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that after the
departure of the damsels Hasan sat in the palace sad and solitary and
his breast was straitened by severance He used to ride forth ahunting
by himself in the wold and bring back the game and slaughter it and eat
thereof alone but melancholy and disquiet redoubled on him by reason
of his loneliness So he arose and went round about the palace and
explored its every part he opened the Princesses apartments and found
therein riches and treasures fit to ravish the beholders reason but he
delighted not in aught thereof by reason of their absence His heart
was fired by thinking of the door they had charged him not to approach
or open on any account and he said in himself My sister had never
enjoined me not to open this door except there were behind it somewhat
whereof she would have none to know but by Allah I will arise and
open it and see what is within though within it were sudden death
Then he took the key and opening the door saw therein no treasure
but he espied a vaulted and winding staircase of Yamani onyx at the
upper end of the chamber So he mounted the stair which brought him out
upon the terraceroof of the palace whence he looked down upon the
gardens and vergiers full of trees and fruits and beasts and birds
warbling praises of Allah the One the Allpowerful and said in
himself This is that they forbade to me He gazed upon these
pleasaunces and saw beyond a surging sea dashing with clashing billows
and he ceased not to explore the palace right and left till he ended at
a pavilion builded with alternate courses two bricks of gold and one of
silver and jacinth and emerald and supported by four columns And in the
centre he saw a sittingroom paved and lined with a mosaic of all manner
precious stones such as rubies and emeralds and balasses and other
jewels of sorts and in its midst stood a basin brimful of water
over which was a trelliswork of sandalwood and aloeswood reticulated
with rods of red gold and wands of emerald and set with various kinds of
jewels and fine pearls each sized as a pigeons egg The trellis was
covered with a climbing vine bearing grapes like rubies and beside the
basin stood a throne of lignaloes latticed with red gold inlaid with
great pearls and comprising varicoloured gems of every sort and
precious minerals each kind fronting each and symmetrically disposed
About it the birds warbled with sweet tongues and various voices
celebrating the praises of Allah the Most High brief it was a palace
such as nor Csar nor Chosros ever owned but Hasan saw therein none of
the creatures of Allah whereat he marvelled and said in himself I
wonder to which of the Kings this place pertaineth or is it
ManyColumned Iram whereof they tell for who among mortals can avail to
the like of this And indeed he was amazed at the spectacle and sat
down in the pavilion and cast glances around him marvelling at the
beauty of its ordinance and at the lustre of the pearls and jewels and
the curious works which therein were no less than at the gardens and
orchards aforesaid and at the birds that hymned the praises of Allah
the One the Almighty and he abode pondering the traces of him whom the
Most High had enabled to rear that structure for indeed He is muchel of
might And presently behold he espied ten birds flying towards
the pavilion from the heart of the desert and knew that they were making
the palace and bound for the basin to drink of its waters so he hid
himself for fear they should see him and take flight They lighted on a
great tree and a goodly and circled round about it and he saw amongst
them a bird of marvelbeauty the goodliest of them all and the nine
stood around it and did it service and Hasan marvelled to see it peck
them with its bill and lord it over them while they fled from it He
stood gazing at them from afar as they entered the pavilion and perched
on the couch after which each bird rent open its neckskin with its
claws and issued out of it and lo it was but a garment of feathers
and there came forth therefrom ten virgins maids whose beauty shamed
the brilliancy of the moon They all doffed their clothes and plunging
into the basin washed and fell to playing and sporting one with other
whilst the chief bird of them lifted up the rest and ducked them down
and they fled from her and dared not put forth their hands to her When
Hasan beheld her thus he took leave of his right reason and his sense
was enslaved so he knew that the Princesses had not forbidden him to
open the door save because of this for he fell passionately in love
with her for what he saw of her beauty and loveliness symmetry and
perfect grace as she played and sported and splashed the others with
the water He stood looking upon them whilst they saw him not with eye
gazing and heart burning and soul to evil prompting and he sighed
to be with them and wept for longing because of the beauty and
loveliness of the chief damsel His mind was amazed at her charms and
his heart taken in the net of her love lowe was loosed in his heart for
her sake and there waxed on him a flame whose sparks might not be
quenched and desire whose signs might not be hidden Presently they
came up out of that basin whilst Hasan marvelled at their beauty and
loveliness and the tokens of inner gifts in the elegance of their
movements Then he cast a glance at the chief damsel who stood
mothernaked and there was manifest to him what was between her thighs a
goodly rounded dome on pillars borne like a bowl of silver or crystal
which recalled to him the saying of the poet

 When I took up her shift and discovered the terraceroof of her kaze I
    found it as strait as my humour or eke my worldly ways
 So I thrust it incontinent in halfway and she heaved a sigh For
    what dost thou sigh quoth I For the rest of it sure she says

Then coming out of the water they all put on their dresses and
ornaments and the chief maiden donned a green dress wherein she
surpassed for loveliness all the fair ones of the world and the lustre
of her face outshone the resplendent full moons she excelled the
branches with the grace of her bending gait and confounded the wit with
apprehension of disdain and indeed she was as saith the poet

 A maiden twas the dressers art had decked with cunning sleight
 The sun thou dst say had robbed her cheek and shone with borrowed
    light
 She came to us apparelled fair in under vest of green
 Like as the ripe pomegranate hides beneath its leafy screen
 And when we asked her what might be the name of what she wore
 She answered in a quaint reply that double meaning bore
 The deserts heart we penetrate in such apparel dressed
 And Pierceheart therefore is the name by which we call the vest

And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her
permitted say


      Now when it was the Seven Hundred and Eightyseventh Night

She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Hasan
saw the damsels issue forth the basin the chief maiden robbed his
reason with her beauty and loveliness compelling him to recite the
couplets forequoted And after dressing they sat talking and laughing
whilst he stood gazing on them drowned in the sea of his love burning
in the flames of passion and wandering in the Wady of his melancholy
thought And he said to himself By Allah my sister forbade me not to
open the door but for cause of these maidens and for fear lest I should
fall in love with one of them How O Hasan shalt thou woo and win them
How bring down a bird flying in the vasty firmament By Allah thou hast
cast thyself into a bottomless sea and snared thyself in a net whence
there is no escape I shall die desolate and none shall wot of my
death And he continued to gaze on the charms of the chief damsel who
was the lovliest creature Allah had made in her day and indeed she
outdid in beauty all human beings She had a mouth magical as Solomons
seal and hair blacker than the night of estrangement to the
lovedespairing man her brow was bright as the crescent moon of the
Feast of Ramazn and her eyes were like eyes wherewith gazelles
scan she had a polished nose straight as a cane and cheeks like
bloodred anemones of Nuuman lips like coralline and teeth like strung
pearls in carcanets of gold virgin to man and a neck like an ingot of
silver above a shape like a wand of Bn her middle was full of folds
a dimpled plain such as enforceth the distracted lover to magnify Allah
and extol His might and main and her navel an ounce of musk
sweetest of savour could contain she had thighs great and plump like
marble columns twain or bolsters stuffed with down from ostrich taen
and between them a somewhat as it were a hummock great of span or a
hare with ears back lain while terraceroof and pilasters completed the
plan and indeed she surpassed the bough of the myrobalan with her
beauty and symmetry and the Indian rattan for she was even as saith of
them the poet whom love did unman

 Her lipdews rival honeysweets that sweet virginity  Keener than
    Hind scymitar the glance she casts at thee
 She shames the bending bough of Bn with graceful movement slow  And as
    she smiles her teeth appear with levens brilliancy

 When I compared with rose abloom the tintage of her cheeks  She
    laughed in scorn and cried Whoso compares with rosery
 My hue and breasts granados terms is there no shame in him  How
    should pomegranates bear on bough such fruit in form or blee
 Now by my beauty and mine eyes and heart and eke by Heaven  Of favours
    mine and by the Hell of my unclemency
 They say She is a gardenrose in very pride of bloom  And yet no
    rose can ape my cheek nor branch my symmetry
 If any garden own a thing which unto me is like  What then is that he
    comes to crave of me and only me

They ceased not to laugh and play whilst Hasan stood still awatching
them forgetting meat and drink till near the hour of midafternoon
prayer when the beauty the chief damsel said to her mates O Kings
daughters it waxeth late and our land is afar and we are weary of this
stead Come therefore let us depart to our own place So they all
arose and donned their feather vests and becoming birds as they were
before flew away all together with the chief lady in their midst
Then Hasan despairing of their return would have arisen and gone down
into the palace but could not move or even stand wherefore the tears
ran down his cheeks and passion was sore on him and he recited these
couplets

 May God deny me boon of troth if I  After your absence sweets of
    slumber know
 Yea since that sevrance never close mine eyes  Nor rest repose me
    since departed you
 Twould seem as though you saw me in your sleep  Would Heaven the
    dreams of sleep were realtrue
 Indeed I dote on sleep though needed not  For sleep may bring me that
    dear form to view

Then Hasan walked on little by little heeding not the way he went
till he reached the foot of the stairs whence he dragged himself to his
own chamber then he entered and shutting the door lay sick eating not
nor drinking and drowned in the sea of his solitude He spent the night
thus weeping and bemoaning himself till the morning and when it
morrowed he repeated these couplets

 The birds took flight at eve and winged their way  And sinless he who
    died of Loves deathblow
 Ill keep my lovetale secret while I can  But an desire prevail its
    needs must show
 Night brought me nightly vision bright as dawn  While nights of my
    desire lack morningglow

 I mourn for them while they heartfreest sleep  And winds of love
    on me their plaything blow
 Free I bestow my tears my wealth my heart  My wit my spritemost
    gain who most bestow
 The worst of woes and banes is enmity  Beautiful maidens deal us to our
    woe
 Favour they says forbidden to the fair  And shedding lovers blood
    their laws allow
 That naught can lovesicks do but lavish soul  And stake in loveplay
    life on single throw
 I cry in longing ardour for my love  Lover can only weep and wail
    Lovelowe

When the sun rose he opened the door went forth of the chamber and
mounted to the stead where he was before then he sat down facing the
pavilion and awaited the return of the birds till nightfall but they
returned not wherefore he wept till he fell to the ground in a
faintingfit When he came to after his swoon he dragged himself down
the stairs to his chamber and indeed the darkness was come and
straitened upon him was the whole world and he ceased not to weep and
wail himself through the livelong night till the day broke and the sun
rained over hill and dale its rays serene He ate not nor drank nor
slept nor was there any rest for him but by day he was distracted and
by night distressed with sleeplessness delirious and drunken with
melancholy thought and excess of lovelonging And he repeated the
verses of the lovedistraught poet

 O thou who shamest sun in morning sheen  The branch confounding yet
    with nescience blest
 Would Heaven I wot an Time shall bring return  And quench the fires
    which flame unmanifest
 Bring us together in a close embrace  Thy cheek upon my cheek thy
    breast abreast
 Who saith In Love dwells sweetness when in Love  Are bitterer days
    than Alos bitterest

And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her
permitted say


       Now when it was the Seven Hundred and Eightyeighth Night

She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Hasan the
goldsmith felt love redouble upon him he recited those lines and as
he abode thus in the stress of his lovedistraction alone and finding
none to cheer him with company behold there arose a dustcloud from
the desert wherefore he ran down and hid himself knowing that the
Princesses who owned the castle had returned Before long the troops
halted and dismounted round the palace and the seven damsels alighted
and entering put off their arms and armour of war As for the youngest
she stayed not to doff her weapons and gear but went straight to
Hasans chamber where finding him not she sought for him till she
lighted on him in one of the sleeping closets hidden feeble and thin
with shrunken body and wasted bones and indeed his colour was changed
and his eyes sunken in his face for lack of food and drink and for much
weeping by reason of his love and longing for the young lady When she
saw him in this plight she was confounded and lost her wits but
presently she questioned him of his case and what had befallen him
saying Tell me what aileth thee O my brother that I may contrive to
do away thine affliction and I will be thy ransom Whereupon he
wept with sore weeping and by way of reply he began reciting

 Lover when parted from the thing he loves  Has naught save weary woe
    and bane to bear
 Inside is sickness outside living lowe  His first is fancy and his
    last despair

When his sister heard this she marvelled at his eloquence and loquent
speech and his readiness at answering her in verse and said to him O
my brother when didst thou fall into this thy case and what hath
betided thee that I find thee speaking in song and shedding tears that
throng Allah upon thee O my brother and by the honest love which is
between us tell me what aileth thee and discover to me thy secret nor
conceal from me aught of that which hath befallen thee in our absence
for my breast is straitened and my life is troubled because of thee He
sighed and railed tears like rain after which he said I fear O my
sister if I tell thee that thou wilt not aid me to win my wish but
wilt leave me to die wretchedly in mine anguish She replied No by
Allah O my brother I will not abandon thee though it cost me my
life So he told her all that had befallen him and that the cause of
his distress and affliction was the passion he had conceived for the
young lady whom he had seen when he opened the forbidden door and how
he had not tasted meat nor drink for ten days past Then he wept with
sore weeping and recited these couplets

 Restore my heart as twas within my breast  Let mine eyes sleep again
    then fly fro me
 Deem ye the nights have had the might to change  Loves vow Who
    changeth may he never be

His sister wept for his weeping and was moved to ruth for his case and
pitied his strangerhood so she said to him O my brother be of good
cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear for I will venture being and
risk existence to content thee and devise thee a device wherewith
though it cost me my dear life and all I hold dear thou mayst get
possession of her and accomplish thy desire if such be the will of
Allah Almighty But I charge thee O my brother keep the matter secret
from my sisterhood and discover not thy case to any one of them lest my
life be lost with thy life An they question thee of opening the
forbidden door reply to themI opened it not no never but I was
troubled at heart for your absence and by my loneliness here and
yearning for you And he answered Yes this is the right rede
So he kissed her head and his heart was comforted and his bosom
broadened He had been nigh upon death for excess of affright for he
had gone in fear of her by reason of his having opened the door but now
his life and soul returned to him Then he sought of her somewhat of
food and after serving it she left him and went in to her sisters
weeping and mourning for him They questioned her of her case and she
told them how she was heavy at heart for her brother because he was
sick and for ten days no food had found way into his stomach So they
asked the cause of his sickness and she answered The reason was our
severance from him and our leaving him desolate for these days we have
been absent from him were longer to him than a thousand years and scant
blame to him seeing he is a stranger and solitary and we left him
alone with none to company with him or hearten his heart more by token
that he is but a youth and may be he called to mind his family and his
mother who is a woman in years and bethought him that she weepeth for
him all whiles of the day and watches of the night ever mourning his
loss and we used to solace him with our society and divert him from
thinking of her When her sisters heard these words they wept in the
stress of their distress for him and said Wallhifore Allah he is
not to blame Then they went out to the army and dismissed it after
which they went in to Hasan and saluted him with the salam When they
saw his charms changed with yellow colour and shrunken body they wept
for very pity and sat by his side and comforted him and cheered him with
converse relating to him all they had seen by the way of wonders and
rarities and what had befallen the bridegroom with the bride They abode
with him thus a whole month tendering him and caressing him with words
sweeter than syrup but every day sickness was added to his sickness
which when they saw they bewept him with sore weeping and the youngest
wept even more than the rest At the end of this time the Princesses
having made up their minds to ride forth ahunting and abirding invited
their sister to accompany them but she said By Allah O my sisters I
cannot go forth with you whilst my brother is in this plight nor
indeed till he be restored to health and there cease from him that which
is with him of affliction Rather will I sit with him and comfort him
They thanked her for her kindness and said to her Allah will requite
thee all thou dost with this stranger Then they left her with him in
the palace and rode forth taking with them twenty days victualAnd
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say


       Now when it was the Seven Hundred and Eightyninth Night

She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Princesses
mounted and rode forth ahunting and abirding after leaving in the
palace their youngest sister sitting by Hasans side and as soon as the
damsel knew that they had covered a long distance from home she went in
to him and said O my brother come show me the place where thou
sawest the maidens He rejoiced in her words making sure of winning
his wish and replied Bismillah On my head Then he essayed to rise
and show her the place but could not walk so she took him up in her
arms holding him to her bosom between her breasts and opening the
staircasedoor carried him to the top of the palace and he showed her
the pavilion where he had seen the girls and the basin of water wherein
they had bathed Then she said to him Set forth to me O my brother
their case and how they came So he described to her whatso he had seen
of them and especially the girl of whom he was enamoured but hearing
these words she knew her and her cheeks paled and her case changed
Quoth he O my sister what aileth thee to wax wan and be troubled
and quoth she O my brother know thou that this young lady is the
daughter of a Sovran of the Jann of one of the most puissant of their
Kings and her father had dominion over men and Jinn and wizards and
cohens and tribal chiefs and guards and countries and cities and islands
galore and hath immense wealth in store Our father is a Viceroy and one
of his vassals and none can avail against him for the multitude of his
many and the extent of his empire and the muchness of his monies He
hath assigned to his offspring the daughters thou sawest a tract of
country a whole years journey in length and breadth a region girt
about with a great river and a deep and thereto none may attain nor
man nor Jann He hath an army of women smiters with swords and lungers
with lances fiveandtwenty thousand in number each of whom whenas
she mounteth steed and donneth battlegear eveneth a thousand knights
of the bravest Moreover he hath seven daughters who in valour and
prowess equal and even excel their sisters and he hath made the
eldest of them the damsel whom thou sawest queen over the country
aforesaid and who is the wisest of her sisters and in valour and
horsemanship and craft and skill and magic excels all the folk of her
dominions The girls who companied with her are the ladies of her court
and guards and grandees of her empire and the plumed skins wherewith
they fly are the handiwork of enchanters of the Jann Now an thou
wouldst get possession of this queen and wed this jewel seldseen and
enjoy her beauty and loveliness and grace do thou pay heed to my words
and keep them in thy memory They resort to this place on the first day
of every month and thou must take seat here and watch for them and
when thou seest them coming hide thee near the pavilion sitting where
thou mayst see them without being seen of them and beware again
beware lest thou show thyself or we shall all lose our lives When they
doff their dress note which is the feathersuit of her whom thou lovest
and take it and it only for this it is that carrieth her to her
country and when thou hast mastered it thou hast mastered her And
beware lest she wile thee sayingO thou who hast robbed my raiment
restore it to me because here am I in thine hands and at thy mercy
For an thou give it her she will kill thee and break down over us
palace and pavilion and slay our sire know then thy case and how thou
shalt act When her companions see that her feathersuit is stolen they
will take flight and leave her to thee and beware lest thou show
thyself to them but wait till they have flown away and she despaireth
of them whereupon do thou go in to her and hale her by the hair of her
head and drag her to thee which being done she will be at thy
mercy And I rede thee discover not to her that thou hast taken the
feathersuit but keep it with care for so long as thou hast it in
hold she is thy prisoner and in thy power seeing that she cannot fly
to her country save with it And lastly carry her down to thy chamber
where she will be thine When Hasan heard her words his heart became at
ease his trouble ceased and affliction left him so he rose to his feet
and kissing his sisters head went down from the terrace with her into
the palace where they slept that night He medicined himself till
morning morrowed and when the sun rose he sprang up and opened the
staircasedoor and ascending to the flat roof sat there till suppertide
when his sister brought him up somewhat of meat and drink and a change
of clothes and he slept And thus they continued doing day by day until
the end of the month When he saw the new moon he rejoiced and began to
watch for the birds and while he was thus behold up they came like
lightning As soon as he espied them he hid himself where he could
watch them unwatched by them and they lighted down one and all of
them and putting off their clothes descended into the basin All this
took place near the stead where Hasan lay concealed and as soon as he
caught sight of the girl he loved he arose and crept under cover
little by little towards the dresses and Allah veiled him so that none
marked his approach for they were laughing and playing with one another
till he laid hand on the dress Now when they had made an end of their
diversion they came forth of the basin and each of them slipped on her
feathersuit But the damsel he loved sought for her plumage that she
might put it on but found it not whereupon she shrieked and beat her
cheeks and rent her raiment Her sisterhood came to her and asked
what ailed her and she told them that her feathersuit was missing
wherefore they wept and shrieked and buffeted their faces and they were
confounded wotting not the cause of this and knew not what to do
Presently the night overtook them and they feared to abide with her lest
that which had befallen her should befal them also so they farewelled
her and flying away left her alone upon the terraceroof of the palace
by the pavilion basinAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased to say her permitted say

Illustration


         Now when it was the Seven Hundred and Ninetieth Night

She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Hasan had
carried off the girls plumery she sought it but found it not and her
sisterhood flew away leaving her alone When they were out of sight
Hasan gave ear to her and heard her say O who hast taken my dress and
stripped me I beseech thee to restore it to me and cover my shame so
may Allah never make thee taste of my tribulation But when Hasan heard
her speak thus with speech sweeter than syrup his love for her
redoubled passion got the mastery of his reason and he had not patience
to endure from her So springing up from his hidingplace he rushed
upon her and laying hold of her by the hair dragged her to him and
carried her down to the basement of the palace and set her in his own
chamber where he threw over her a silken cloak and left her weeping
and biting her hands Then he shut the door upon her and going to his
sister informed her how he had made prize of his lover and carried her
to his sleepingcloset And there quoth he she is now sitting
weeping and biting her hands When his Sister heard this she rose
forthright and betook herself to the chamber where she found the
captive weeping and mourning So she kissed ground before her and
saluted her with the salam and the young lady said to her O Kings
daughter do folk like you do such foul deed with the daughters of
Kings Thou knowest that my father is a mighty Sovran and that all the
liege lords of the Jinn stand in awe of him and fear his majesty for
that there are with him magicians and sages and Cohens and Satans and
Marids such as none may cope withal and under his hand are folk whose
number none knoweth save Allah How then doth it become you O daughters
of Kings to harbour mortal men with you and disclose to them our case
and yours Else how should this man a stranger come at us Hasans
sister made reply O Kings daughter in very sooth this human is
perfect in nobleness and purposeth thee no villainy but he loveth thee
and women were not made save for men Did he not love thee he had not
fallen sick for thy sake and wellnigh given up the ghost for desire of
thee And she told her the whole tale how Hasan had seen her bathing in
the basin with her attendants and fallen in love with her and none had
pleased him but she for the rest were all her handmaids and none had
availed to put forth a hand to her When the Princess heard this she
despaired of deliverance and presently Hasans sister went forth and
brought her a costly dress wherein she robed her Then she set before
her somewhat of meat and drink and ate with her and heartened her heart
and soothed her sorrows And she ceased not to speak her fair with soft
and pleasant words saying Have pity on him who saw thee once and
became as one slain by thy love and continued to console her and
caress her quoting fair says and pleasant instances But she wept till
daybreak when her trouble subsided and she left shedding tears knowing
that she had fallen into the net and that there was no deliverance for
her Then said she to Hasans sister O Kings daughter with this my
strangerhood and severance from my country and sisterhood which Allah
wrote upon my brow patience becometh me to support what my Lord hath
foreordained Therewith the youngest Princess assigned her a chamber in
the palace than which there was none goodlier and ceased not to sit
with her and console her and solace her heart till she was satisfied
with her lot and her bosom was broadened and she laughed and there
ceased from her what trouble and oppression possessed her by reason of
her separation from her people and country and sisterhood and parents
Thereupon Hasans sister repaired to him and said Arise go in to her
in her chamber and kiss her hands and feet So he went in to her
and did this and bussed her between the eyes saying O Princess of
fair ones and life of sprites and beholders delight be easy of heart
for I took thee only that I might be thy bondsman till the Day of Doom
and this my sister will be thy servant for I O my lady desire naught
but to take thee to wife after the law of Allah and the practice of His
Apostle and whenas thou wilt I will journey with thee to my country
and carry thee to Baghdadcity and abide with thee there moreover I
will buy thee handmaidens and negro chattels and I have a mother of
the best of women who will do thee service There is no goodlier land
than our land everything therein is better than elsewhere and its folk
are a pleasant people and bright of face Now as he bespake her thus
and strave to comfort her what while she answered him not a syllable
lo there came a knocking at the palacegate So Hasan went out to see
who was at the door and found there the six Princesses who had returned
from hunting and birding whereat he rejoiced and went to meet them and
welcomed them They wished him safety and health and he wished them the
like after which they dismounted and going each to her chamber doffed
their soiled clothes and donned fine linen Then they came forth and
demanded the game for they had taken a store of gazelles and wild cows
hares and lions hynas and others so their suite brought out some
thereof for butchering keeping the rest by them in the palace and
Hasan girt himself and fell to slaughtering for them in due form
whilst they sported and made merry joying with great joy to see him
standing amongst them hale and hearty once more When they had made an
end of slaughtering they sat down and addressed themselves to get ready
somewhat for breaking their fast and Hasan coming up to the eldest
Princess kissed her head and on like wise did he with the rest one
after other Whereupon said they to him Indeed thou humblest thyself
to us passing measure O our brother and we marvel at the excess of the
affection thou showest us But Allah forfend that thou shouldst do this
thing which it behoveth us rather to do with thee seeing thou art a
man and therefor worthier than we who are of the Jinn Thereupon
his eyes brimmed with tears and he wept sore so they said to him What
causeth thee to weep Indeed thou troublest our pleasant lives with thy
weeping this day Twould seem thou longest after thy mother and native
land An things be so we will equip thee and carry thee to thy home and
thy friends He replied By Allah I desire not to part from you
Then they asked Which of us hath vexed thee that thou art thus
troubled But he was ashamed to say Naught troubleth me save love of
the damsel lest they should deny and disavow him so he was silent and
would tell them nothing of his case Then his sister came forward and
said to them He hath caught a bird from the air and would have you
help him to tame her Whereupon they all turned to him and cried We
are at thy service every one of us and whatsoever thou seekest that will
we do but tell us thy tale and conceal from us naught of thy case So
he said to his sister Do thou tell them for I am ashamed before them
nor can I face them with these wordsAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn
of day and ceased saying her permitted say


       Now when it was the Seven Hundred and Ninetyfirst Night

She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Hasan said to his
sister Do thou tell them my tale for before them I stand abashed nor
can I face them with these words So she said to them O my sisters
when we went away and left alone this unhappy one the palace was
straitened upon him and he feared lest some one should come in to him
for ye know that the sons of Adam are light of wits So he opened the
door of the staircase leading to the roof of his loneliness and
trouble and sat there looking upon the Wady and watching the gate in
his fear lest any should come thither One day as he sat thus suddenly
he saw ten birds approach him making for the palace and they lighted
down on the brink of the basin which is in the pavilionterrace He
watched these birds and saw amongst them one goodlier than the rest
which pecked the others and flouted them whilst none of them dared not
put out a claw to it Presently they set their nails to their
neckcollars and rending their feathersuits came forth therefrom and
became damsels each and every like the moon on fullest night Then
they doffed their dress and plunging into the water fell to playing
with one another whilst the chief damsel ducked the others who dared
not lay a finger on her and she was fairest of favour and most famous of
form and most feateous of finery They ceased not to be in this case
till near the hour of midafternoon prayer when they came forth of the
basin and donning their feathershifts flew away home Thereupon he
waxed distracted with a heart afire for love of the chief damsel and
repenting him that he had not stolen her plumery Wherefore he fell sick
and abode on the palaceroof expecting her return and abstaining from
meat and drink and sleep and he ceased not to be so till the new moon
showed when behold they again made their appearance according to
custom and doffing their dresses went down into the basin So he stole
the chief damsels feathersuit knowing that she could not fly save
therewith hiding himself carefully lest they sight him and slay him
Then he waited till the rest had flown away when he arose and seizing
the damsel carried her down from the terrace into the castle Her
sisters asked Where is she and she answered She is with him in
such a chamber Quoth they Describe her to us O our sister so
quoth she She is fairer than the moon on the night of fullness and her
face is sheenier than the sun the dew of her lips is sweeter than honey
and her shape is straighter and slenderer than the cane one with eyes
black as night and brow flowerwhite a bosom jewelbright breasts like
pomegranates twain and cheeks like apples twain a waist with dimples
overlain a navel like a casket of ivory full of musk in grain and legs
like columns of alabastrine vein She ravisheth all hearts with
Naturekohld eyne and a waist slenderfine and hips of heaviest design
and speech that heals all pain and pine she is goodly of shape and
sweet of smile as she were the moon in fullest sheen and shine When
the Princesses heard these praises they turned to Hasan and said to
him Show her to us So he arose with them all lovedistraught and
carrying them to the chamber wherein was the captive damsel opened the
door and entered preceding the seven Princesses Now when they saw her
and noted her loveliness they kissed the ground between her hands
marvelling at the fairness of her favour and the significance which
showed her inner gifts and said to her By Allah O daughter of the
Sovran Supreme this is indeed a mighty matter and haddest thou heard
tell of this mortal among women thou haddest marvelled at him all thy
days Indeed he loveth thee with passionate love yet O Kings
daughter he seeketh not lewdness but desireth thee only in the way of
lawful wedlock Had we known that maids can do without men we had
impeached him from his intent albeit he sent thee no messenger but
came to thee in person and he telleth us he hath burnt the feather
dress else had we taken it from him Then one of them agreed with the
Princess and becoming her deputy in the matter of the wedding contract
performed the marriage ceremony between them whilst Hasan clapped palms
with her laying his hand in hers and she wedded him to the damsel by
consent after which they celebrated her bridal feast as beseemeth
Kings daughters and brought Hasan in to her So he rose and rent the
veil and oped the gate and pierced the forge and brake the seal
whereupon affection for her waxed in him and he redoubled in love and
longing for her Then since he had gotten that which he sought he gave
himself joy and improvised these couplets

 Thy shapes temptation eyes as Houris fain  And sheddeth Beautys
    sheen that radiance rare
 My glance portrayed thy glorious portraiture  Rubies onehalf and gems
    the third part were
 Musk made a fifth a sixth was ambergris  The sixth a pearl but pearl
    without compare
 Eve never bare a daughter evening thee  Nor breathes thy like in
    Khulds celestial air
 An thou would torture me tis wont of Love  And if thou pardon tis thy
    choice I swear
 Then O world brightner and O end of wish  Loss of thy charms who
    could in patience bear

And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her
permitted say


       Now when it was the Seven Hundred and Ninetysecond Night

She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Hasan
went in unto the Kings daughter and did away her maidenhead he enjoyed
her with exceeding joy and affection for her waxed in him and he
redoubled in lovelonging for her so he recited the lines aforesaid
Now the Princesses were standing at the door and when they heard his
verses they said to her O Kings daughter hearest thou the words of
this mortal How canst thou blame us seeing that he maketh poetry for
love of thee and indeed he hath so done a thousand times When she
heard this she rejoiced and was glad and felt happy and Hasan abode with
her forty days in all solace and delight joyance and happiest
plight whilst the damsels renewed festivities for him every day and
overwhelmed him with bounty and presents and rarities and the Kings
daughter became reconciled to her sojourn amongst them and forgot her
kith and kin At the end of the forty days Hasan saw in a dream one
night his mother mourning for him and indeed her bones were wasted and
her body had waxed shrunken and her complexion had yellowed and her
favour had changed the while he was in excellent case When she saw him
in this state she said to him O my son O Hasan how is it that thou
livest thy worldly life at thine ease and forgettest me Look at my
plight since thy loss I do not forget thee nor will my tongue cease to
name thy name till I die and I have made thee a tomb in my house that
I may never forget thee Would Heaven I knew if I shall live O my
son to see thee by my side and if we shall ever again foregather as we
were Thereupon Hasan awoke from sleep weeping and wailing the tears
railed down his cheeks like rain and he became mournful and melancholy
his tears dried not nor did sleep visit him but he had no rest and no
patience was left to him When he arose the Princesses came in to him
and gave him goodmorrow and made merry with him as was their wont but
he paid no heed to them so they asked his wife concerning his case and
she said I ken not Quoth they Question him of his condition So
she went up to him and said What aileth thee O my lord Whereupon he
moaned and groaned and told her what he had seen in his dream and
repeated these two couplets

 Indeed afflicted sore are we and all distraught  Seeking for union
    yet we find no way
 And Loves calamities upon us grow       And Love though light with
    heaviest weight doth weigh

His wife repeated to the Princesses what he said and they hearing the
verses had pity on him and said to him In Allahs name do as thou
wilt for we may not hinder thee from visiting thy mother nay we will
help thee to thy wish by what means we may But it behoveth that thou
desert us not but visit us though it be only once a year And he
answered To hear is to obey be your behest on my head and eyes Then
they arose forthright and making him ready victual for the voyage
equipped the bride for him with raiment and ornaments and everything of
price such as defy description and they bestowed on him gifts and
presents which pens of ready writers lack power to set forth Then they
beat the magical kettledrum and up came the dromedaries from all sides
They chose of them such as could carry all the gear they had prepared
amongst the rest fiveandtwenty chests of gold and fifty of silver
and mounting Hasan and his bride on others rode with them three days
wherein they accomplished a march of three months Then they bade them
farewell and addressed themselves to return whereupon his sister the
youngest damsel threw herself on Hasans neck and wept till she
fainted When she came to herself she repeated these two couplets

 Neer dawn the severanceday on any wise  That robs of sleep these
    heavylidded eyes
 From us and thee it hath fair union torn  It wastes our force and makes
    our forms its prize

Her verses finished she farewelled him straitly charging him whenas he
should have come to his native land and have foregathered with his
mother and set his heart at ease to fail not of visiting her once in
every six months and saying If aught grieve thee or thou fear aught of
vexation beat the Magians kettledrum whereupon the dromedaries shall
come to thee and do thou mount and return to us and persist not in
staying away He swore thus to do and conjured them to go home So they
returned to the palace mourning for their separation from him
especially the youngest with whom no rest would stay nor would Patience
her call obey but she wept night and day Thus it was with them but as
regards Hasan and his wife they fared on by day and night over plain
and desert site and valley and stony heights through noontide glare and
dawns soft light and Allah decreed them safety so that they reached
Bassorahcity without hindrance and made their camels kneel at the door
of his house Hasan then dismissed the dromedaries and going up to the
door to open it heard his mother weeping and in a faint strain from a
heart worn with partingpain and on fire with consuming bane reciting
these couplets

 How shall he taste of sleep who lacks repose  Who wakes anight when
    all in slumber wone
 He ownd wealth and family and fame  Yet fared from house and home an
    exile lone

 Live coal beneath his ribs he bears for bane  And mighty longing
    mightier neer was known
 Passion hath seized him Passion mastered him  Yet is he constant
    while he maketh moan
 His case for Love proclaimed aye that he  As prove his tears is
    wretched woebegone

When Hasan heard his mother weeping and wailing he wept also and knocked
at the door a loud knock Quoth she Who is at the door and quoth
he Open Whereupon she opened the door and knowing him at first sight
fell down in a fainting fit but he ceased not to tend her till she came
to herself when he embraced her and she embraced him and kissed him
whilst his wife looked on mother and son Then he carried his goods and
gear into the house whilst his mother for that her heart was comforted
and Allah had reunited her with her son versified with these couplets

 Fortune had ruth upon my plight  Pitied my long long bane and blight
 Gave me what I would liefest sight  And set me free from all affright
 So pardon I the sin that sin  nd she in days evanisht quite
 Een to the sin she sinned when she  Bleached my hairparting silvern
    white

And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her
permitted say


       Now when it was the Seven Hundred and Ninetythird Night

She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that Hasan with his
mother then sat talking and she asked him How faredst thou O my son
with the Persian whereto he answered O my mother he was no Persian
but a Magian who worshipped the fire not the Allpowerful Sire Then
he told her how he dealt with him in that he had journeyed with him to
the Mountain of Clouds and sewed him up in the camels skin and how the
vultures had taken him up and set him down on the summit and what he had
seen there of dead folk whom the Magian had deluded and left to die on
the crest after they had done his desire And he told her how he had
cast himself from the mountaintop into the sea and Allah the Most High
had preserved him and brought him to the palace of the seven Princesses
and how the youngest of them had taken him to brother and he had
sojourned with them till the Almighty brought the Magian to the place
where he was and he slew him Moreover he told her of his passion for
the Kings daughter and how he had made prize of her and of his seeing
her in sleep and all else that had befallen him up to the time when
Allah vouchsafed them reunion She wondered at his story and praised the
Lord who had restored him to her in health and safety Then she arose
and examined the baggage and loads and questioned him of them So he
told her what was in them whereat she joyed with exceeding joy Then
she went up to the Kings daughter to talk with her and bear her
company but when her eyes fell on her her wits were confounded at her
brilliancy and she rejoiced and marvelled at her beauty and loveliness
and symmetry and perfect grace and she sat down beside her cheering
her and comforting her heart while she never ceased to repeat
Alhamdolillah O my son for thy return to me safe and sound Next
morning early she went down into the market and bought mighty fine
furniture and ten suits of the richest raiment in the city and clad the
young wife and adorned her with everything seemly Then said she to
Hasan O my son we cannot tarry in this town with all this wealth for
thou knowest that we are poor folk and the people will suspect us of
practising alchemy So come let us depart to Baghdad the House of
Peace where we may dwell in the Caliphs Sanctuary and thou shalt sit
in a shop to buy and sell in the fear of Allah to whom belong Might
and Majesty and He shall open to thee the door of blessings with this
wealth Hasan approved her counsel and going forth straightway sold
the house and summoned the dromedaries which he loaded with all his
goods and gear together with his mother and wife Then he went down to
the Tigris where he hired him a craft to carry them to Baghdad and
embarked therein all his possessions and his mother and wife They
sailed up the river with a fair wind for ten days till they drew in
sight of Baghdad at which they all rejoiced and the ship landed them
in the city where without stay or delay Hasan hired a storehouse in one
of the caravanserais and transported his goods thither He lodged that
night in the Khan and on the morrow he changed his clothes and going
down into the city enquired for a broker The folk directed him to one
and when the broker saw him he asked him what he lacked Quoth he I
want a house a handsome one and a spacious So the broker showed him
the houses at his disposal and he chose one that belonged to one of the
Wazirs and buying it of him for an hundred thousand golden dinars gave
him the price Then he returned to his caravanserai and removed all his
goods and monies to the house after which he went down to the market
and bought all the mansion needed of vessels and carpets and other
household stuff besides servants and eunuchs including a little black
boy for the house He abode with his wife in all solace and delight of
life three years during which time he was vouchsafed by her two sons
one of whom he named Nsir and the other Mansr but at the end of this
time he bethought him of his sisters the Princesses and called to mind
all their goodness to him and how they had helped him to his desire So
he longed after them and going out to the marketstreets of the city
bought trinkets and costly stuffs and fruitconfections such as they
had never seen or known His mother asked him the reason of his buying
these rarities and he answered I purpose to visit my sisters who
showed me every kind of kindness and all the wealth that I at present
enjoy is due to their goodness and munificence wherefore I will journey
to them and return soon Inshallah Quoth she O my son be not long
absent from me and quoth he Know O my mother how thou shalt do
with my wife Here is her featherdress in a chest buried under ground
in such a place do thou watch over it lest haply she hap on it and
take it for she would fly away she and her children and I should
never hear of them again and should die of grieving for them wherefore
take heed O my mother while I warn thee that thou name this not to
her Thou must know that she is the daughter of a King of the Jinn than
whom there is not a greater among the Sovrans of the Jann nor a richer
in troops and treasure and she is mistress of her people and dearest to
her father of all he hath Moreover she is passing highspirited so do
thou serve her thyself and suffer her not to go forth the door neither
look out of window nor over the wall for I fear the air for her when it
bloweth and if aught befel her of the calamities of this world I
should slay myself for her sake She replied O my son I take refuge
with Allah from gainsaying thee Am I mad that thou shouldst lay
this charge on me and I disobey thee therein Depart O my son with
heart at ease and please Allah soon thou shalt return in safety and
see her and she shall tell thee how I have dealt with her but tarry
not O my son beyond the time of travelAnd Shahrazad perceived the
dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say


       Now when it was the Seven Hundred and Ninetyfourth Night

She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Hasan had
determined to visit the Princesses he gave his mother the orders we
have mentioned Now as Fate would have it his wife heard what he
said to his mother and neither of them knew it Then Hasan went without
the city and beat the kettledrum whereupon up came the dromedaries and
he loaded twenty of them with rarities of AlIrak after which he
returned to his mother and repeated his charge to her and took leave of
her and his wife and children one of whom was a yearling babe and the
other two years old Then he mounted and fared on without stopping
night or day over hills and valleys and plains and wastes for a term of
ten days till on the eleventh he reached the palace and went in to his
sisters with the gifts he had brought them The Princesses rejoiced at
his sight and gave him joy of his safety whilst his sister decorated
the palace within and without Then they took the presents and lodging
him in a chamber as before asked him of his mother and his wife and he
told them that she had borne him two sons And the youngest Princess
seeing him well and in good case joyed with exceeding joy and repeated
this couplet

 I ever ask for news of you from whatso breezes pass  And never any but
    yourselves can pass across my mind

Then he abode with them in all honour and hospitality for three months
spending his time in feasting and merrymaking joy and delight hunting
and sporting So fared it with him but as regards his wife she abode
with his mother two days after her husbands departure and on the third
day she said to her Glory be to God Have I lived with him three
years and shall I never go to the bath Then she wept and Hasans
mother had pity on her condition and said to her O my daughter here
we are strangers and thy husband is abroad Were he at home he would
serve thee himself but as for me I know no one However O my
daughter I will heat thee water and wash thy head in the Hammambath
which is in the house Answered the Kings daughter O my lady hadst
thou spoken thus to one of the slavegirls she had demanded to be sold
in the Sultans open market and had not abode with thee Men are
excusable because they are jealous and their reason telleth them that
if a woman go forth the house haply she will do frowardness But women
O my lady are not all equal and alike and thou knowest that if woman
have a mind to aught whether it be the Hammam or what not else none
hath power over her to guard her or keep her chaste or debar her from
her desire for she will do whatso she willeth and naught restraineth
her but her reason and her religion Then she wept and cursed fate
and bemoaned herself and her strangerhood till Hasans mother was moved
to ruth for her case and knew that all she said was but truth and that
there was nothing for it but to let her have her way So she committed
the affair to Allah extolled and exalted be He and making ready all
that they needed for the bath took her and went with her to the Hammam
She carried her two little sons with her and when they entered they
put off their clothes and all the women fell to gazing on the Princess
and glorifying God to whom belong Might and Majesty for that He had
created so fair a form The women of the city even those who were
passing by flocked to gaze upon her and the report of her was noised
abroad in Baghdad till the bath was crowded that there was no passing
through it Now it chanced there was present on that day and on that
rare occasion with the rest of the women in the Hammam one of the
slavegirls of the Commander of the Faithful Harun alRashid by name
Tohfah the Lutanist and she finding the Hammam over crowded and no
passing for the throng of women and girls asked what was to do and
they told her of the young lady So she walked up to her and
considering her closely was amazed at her grace and loveliness and
glorified God magnified be His majesty for the fair forms He hath
created The sight hindered her from her bath so that she went not
farther in nor washed but sat staring at the Princess till she had
made an end of bathing and coming forth of the caldarium donned her
raiment whereupon beauty was added to her beauty She sat down on the
divan whilst the women gazed upon her then she looked at them and
veiling Herself went out Tohfah went out with her and followed her
till she saw where she dwelt when she left her and returned to the
Caliphs palace and ceased not wending till she went in to the Lady
Zubaydah and kissed ground between her hands whereupon quoth her
mistress O Tohfah why hast thou tarried in the Hammam She replied
O my lady I have seen a marvel never saw I its like amongst men or
women and this it was that distracted me and dazed my wit and amazed
me so that I forgot even to wash my head Asked Zubaydah And what
was that and Tohfah answered O my lady I saw a damsel in the bath
having with her two little boys like moons eye never espied her like
nor before her nor after her neither is there the fellow of her form in
the whole world nor her peer amongst Ajams or Turks or Arabs By the
munificence O my lady an thou toldest the Commander of the Faithful of
her he would slay her husband and take her from him for her like is
not to be found among women I asked of her mate and they told me that
he is a merchant Hasan of Bassorah hight Moreover I followed her from
the bath to her own house and found it to be that of the Wazir with the
two gates one opening on the river and the other on the land
Indeed O my lady I fear lest the Prince of True Believers hear of her
and break the law and slay her husband and take loveliesse with
herAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her
permitted say


       Now when it was the Seven Hundred and Ninetyfifth Night

She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Tohfah
after seeing the Kings daughter described her beauty to the Lady
Zubaydah ending with Indeed O my mistress I fear lest the Prince of
True Believers hear of her and break the law and slay her mate and take
her to wife Zubaydah cried Woe to thee O Tohfah say me doth this
damsel display such passing beauty and loveliness that the Commander of
the Faithful should on her account barter his souls good for his
worldly lust and break the Holy Law By Allah needs must I look on her
and if she be not as thou sayest I will bid strike off thy head O
strumpet there are in the Caliphs Serraglio three hundred and three
score slave girls after the number of the days of the year yet is
there none amongst them so excellent as thou describest Tohfah
replied No by Allah O my lady nor is there her like in all
Baghdad no nor amongst the Arabs or the Daylamites nor hath Allah to
whom belong Might and Majesty created the like of her Thereupon
Zubaydah called for Masrur the eunuch who came and kissed the ground
before her and she said to him O Masrur go to the Wazirs house
that with the two gates one giving on the water and the other on the
land and bring me the damsel who dwelleth there also her two children
and the old woman who is with her and haste thou and tarry not Said
Masrur I hear and I obey and repairing to Hasans house knocked at
the door Quoth the old woman Who is at the door and quoth he
Masrur the eunuch of the Commander of the Faithful So she opened the
door and he entered and saluted her with the salam whereupon she
returned his salute and asked his need and he replied The Lady
Zubaydah daughter of AlKasim and queenspouse of the Commander of
the Faithful Harun alRashid sixth of the sons of AlAbbas paternal
uncle of the Prophet whom Allah bless and keep summoneth thee to her
thee and thy sons wife and her children for the women have told her
anent her and her beauty Rejoined the old woman O my lord Masrur we
are foreigner folk and the girls husband my son who is abroad and far
from home hath strictly charged me not to go forth nor let her go forth
in his absence neither show her to any of the creatures of Allah
Almighty and I fear me if aught befal her and he come back he will
slay himself wherefore of thy favour I beseech thee O Masrur require
us not of that whereof we are unable Masrur retorted O my lady if I
knew aught to be feared for you in this I would not require you to go
the Lady Zubaydah desireth but to see her and then she may return So
disobey not or thou wilt repent and like as I take you I will bring
you both back in safety Inshallah Hasans mother could not gainsay
him so she went in and making the damsel ready brought her and her
children forth and they all followed Masrur to the palace of the
Caliphate where he carried them in and seated them on the floor before
the Lady Zubaydah They kissed ground before her and called down
blessings upon her and Zubaydah said to the young lady who was
veiled Wilt thou not uncover thy face that I may look on it So she
kissed the ground between her hands and discovered a face which put to
shame the full moon in the height of heaven Zubaydah fixed her eyes on
her and let their glances wander over her whilst the palace was
illumined by the light of her countenance whereupon the Queen and the
whole company were amazed at her beauty and all who looked on her became
Jinnmad and unable to bespeak one another As for Zubaydah she rose
and making the damsel stand up strained her to her bosom and seated her
by herself on the couch Moreover she bade decorate the palace in her
honour and calling for a suit of the richest raiment and a necklace of
the rarest ornaments put them upon her Then said she to her O liege
lady of fair ones verily thou astoundest me and fillest mine eyes
What arts knowest thou She replied O my lady I have a dress of
feathers and could I but put it on before thee thou wouldst see one of
the fairest of fashions and marvel thereat and all who saw it would
talk of its goodliness generation after generation Zubaydah asked
And where is this dress of thine and the damsel answered Tis with
my husbands mother Do thou seek it for me of her So Zubaydah said to
the old woman O my lady the pilgrimess O my mother go forth and
fetch us her featherdress that we may solace ourselves by looking on
what she will do and after take it back again Replied the old woman
O my lady this damsel is a liar Hast thou ever seen any of womankind
with a dress of feathers Indeed this belongeth only to birds But the
damsel said to the Lady Zubaydah As thou livest O my lady she hath a
featherdress of mine and it is in a chest which is buried in such a
storecloset in the house So Zubaydah took off her neck a rivire of
jewels worth all the treasures of Chosroe and Csar and gave it to the
old woman saying O my mother I conjure thee by my life take this
necklace and go and fetch us this dress that we may divert ourselves
with the sight thereof and after take it again But she sware to her
that she had never seen any such dress and wist not what the damsel
meant by her speech Then the Lady Zubaydah cried out at her and taking
the key from her called Masrur and said to him as soon as he came
Take this key and go to the house then open it and enter a
storecloset there whose door is such and such and amiddlemost of it
thou wilt find a chest buried Take it out and break it open and bring
me the featherdress which is therein and set it before meAnd
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say


       Now when it was the Seven Hundred and Ninetysixth Night

She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Lady Zubaydah
having taken the key from Hasans mother handed it to Masrur saying
Take this key and open such a closet then bring forth of it the chest
break it open bring me the featherdress which is therein and set it
before me Hearkening and obedience replied he and taking the key
went forth whereupon the old woman arose and followed him weepingeyed
and repenting her of having given ear to the damsel and gone with her to
the bath for her desire to go thither was but a device So she went
with him to the house and opened the door of the closet and he entered
and brought out the chest Then he took therefrom the featherdress and
wrapping it in a napkin carried it to the Lady Zubaydah who took it
and turned it about marvelling at the beauty of its make after which
she gave it to the damsel saying Is this thy dress of feathers She
replied Yes O my lady and at once putting forth her hand took it
joyfully Then she examined it and rejoiced to find it whole as it was
not a feather gone So she rose and came down from beside the Lady
Zubaydah and taking her sons in her bosom wrapped herself in the
featherdress and became a bird by the ordinance of Allah to whom
belong Might and Majesty whereat Zubaydah marvelled as did all who
were present Then she walked with a swaying and graceful gait and
danced and sported and flapped her wings whilst all eyes were fixed on
her and all marvelled at what she did Then said she with fluent tongue
Is this goodly O my ladies and they replied Yes O Princess of
the fair All thou dost is goodly Said she And this O my
mistresses that I am about to do is better yet Then she spread her
wings and flying up with her children to the dome of the palace perched
on the saloonroof whilst they all looked at her wideeyed and said
By Allah this is indeed a rare and peregrine fashion Never saw we its
like Then as she was about to take flight for her own land she
bethought her of Hasan and said Hark ye my mistresses and she
improvised these couplets

 O who hast quitted these abodes and faredst lief and light  To other
    objects of thy love with fain and fastest flight
 Deemst thou that bided I with you in solace and in joy  Or that my
    days amid you all were clear of bane and blight
 When I was captive taen of Love and snard in his snare  He made of
    Love my prison and he fared fro me forthright
 So when my fear was hidden he made sure that neer should I  Pray to
    the One th Omnipotent to render me my right
 He charged his mother keep the secret with all the care she could  In
    closet shut and treated me with enemys despight
 But I oerheard their words and held them fast in memory  And hoped for
    fortune fair and weal and blessings infinite
 My faring to the Hammam bath then proved to me the means  Of making
    minds of folk to be confounded at my sight
 Wondered the Bride of AlRashd to see my brilliancy  When she beheld
    me right and left with all of beauty dight
 Then quoth I O our Caliphs wife I once was wont to own  A dress of
    feathers rich and rare that did the eyes delight
 An it were now on me thou shouldst indeed see wondrous things  That
    would efface all sorrows and disperse all sores of sprite
 Then deigned our Caliphs Bride to cry Where is that dress of thine
     And I replied In house of him kept darkling as the night

 So down upon it pounced Masrr and brought it unto her  And when twas
    there each feather cast a ray of beaming light
 Therewith I took it from his hand and opened it straightway  And saw
    its plumd bosom and its buttons pleased my sight
 And so I clad myself therein and took with me my babes  And spread my
    wings and flew away with all my main and might
 Saying O husbands mother mine tell him when cometh he  An ever
    wouldest meet her thou from house and home must flee

When she had made an end of her verses the Lady Zubaydah said to her
Wilt thou not come down to us that we may take our fill of thy beauty
O fairest of the fair Glory be to Him who hath given thee eloquence and
brilliance But she said Far be from me that the Past return should
see Then said she to the mother of the hapless wretched Hasan By
Allah O my lady O mother of my husband it irketh me to part from
thee but whenas thy son cometh to thee and upon him the nights of
severance longsome shall be and he craveth reunion and meeting to see
and whenas breezes of love and longing shake him dolefully let him come
in the islands of Wk to me Then she took flight with her children
and sought her own country whilst the old woman wept and beat her face
and moaned and groaned till she swooned away When she came to herself
she said to the Lady Zubaydah O my lady what is this thou hast done
And Zubaydah said to her O my lady the pilgrimess I knew not that
this would happen and hadst thou told me of the case and acquainted me
with her condition I had not gainsaid thee Nor did I know until now
that she was of the Flying Jinn else had I not suffered her to don the
dress nor permitted her to take her children but now O my lady words
profit nothing so do thou acquit me of offence against thee And the
old woman could do no otherwise than shortly answer Thou art
acquitted Then she went forth the palace of the Caliphate and returned
to her own house where she buffeted her face till she swooned away
When she came to herself she pined for her daughterinlaw and her
grandchildren and for the sight of her son and versified with these
couplets

 Your faring on the partingday drew many a tear fro me  Who must your
    flying from the home long mourn in misery
 And cried I for the parting pang in anguish likest fire  And
    tearfloods chafed mine eyelids sore that neer of tears were free
 Yes this is Severance Ah shall we eer joy return of you  For your
    departure hath deprived my power of privacy
 Ah would they had returned to me in covenant of faith  An they return
    perhaps restore of past these eyne may see

Then arising she dug in the house three graves and betook herself to
them with weeping all whiles of the day and watches of the night and
when her sons absence was longsome upon her and grief and yearning and
unquiet waxed upon her she recited these couplets

 Deep in mine eyeballs ever dwells the phantomform of thee  My heart
    when throbbing or at rest holds fast thy memory
 And love of thee doth never cease to course within my breast  As
    course the juices in the fruits which deck the branchy tree

 And every day I see thee not my bosom straightened is  And even
    censurers excuse the woes in me they see
 O thou whose love hath gotten hold the foremost in the heart  Of me
    whose fondness is excelled by mine insanity
 Fear the Compassionate in my case and some compassion show  Love of
    thee makes me taste of death in bitterest pungency

And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her
permitted say


      Now when it was the Seven Hundred and Ninetyseventh Night

She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that Hasans
mother bewept through the watches of the night and the whiles of the day
her separation from her son and his wife and children On this wise it
fared with her but as regards Hasan when he came to the Princesses
they conjured him to tarry with them three months after which long
sojourn they gave him five loads of gold and the like of silver and one
load of victual and accompanied him on his homeward way till he conjured
them to return whereupon they farewelled him with an embrace but the
youngest came up to him to bid him adieu and clasping his neck wept
till she fainted Then she recited these two couplets

 When shall the severancefire be quenched by union love with you 
    When shall I win my wish of you and days that were renew
 The partingday affrighted me and wrought me dire dismay  And doubleth
    woe O master mine by the sad word Adieu

Anon came forward the second Princess and embraced him and recited these
two couplets

 Farewelling thee indeed is like to bidding life farewell  And like the
    loss of Zephyr tis to lose thee far our sight
 Thine absence is a flaming fire which burneth up my heart  And in thy
    presence I enjoy the Gardens of Delight

Presently came forward the third and embraced him and recited these two
couplets

 We left not taking leave of thee when bound to other goal  From aught
    of ill intention or from weariness and dole
 Thou art my soul my very soul the only soul of me  And how shall I
    farewell myself and say Adieu my Soul

After her came forward the fourth and embraced him and recited these two
couplets

 Nought garred me weep save where and when of severance spake he 
    Persisting in his cruel will with sore persistency
 Look at this pearllike ornament Ive hung upon mine ear  Tis of the
    tears of me compact this choicest jewelry

In her turn came forward the fifth and embraced him and recited these
two couplets

 Ah fare thee not for Ive no force thy faring to endure  Nor een to
    say the word farewell before my friend is sped
 Nor any patience to support the days of severance  Nor any tears on
    ruined house and wasted home to shed

Next came the sixth and embraced him and recited these two couplets

 I cried as the camels went off with them  And Love pained my vitals
    with sorest pain
 Had I a King who would lend me rule  Id seize every ship that dares
    sail the Main

Lastly came forward the seventh and embraced him and recited these
couplets

 When thou seest parting be patient still Symbol star Nor let
    foreign parts deal thy soul affright
 But abide expecting a swift return Symbol star For all hearts hold
    parting in sore despight

And eke these two couplets

 Indeed Im heartbroken to see thee start  Nor can I farewell thee ere
    thou depart
 Allah wotteth I left not to say adieu  Save for fear that saying would
    melt your heart

Hasan also wept for parting from them till he swooned and repeated
these couplets

 Indeed ran my tears on the severanceday  Like pearls I threaded in
    necklaceway
 The cameleer drove his camels with song  But I lost heart patience and
    strength and stay
 I bade them farewell and retired in grief  From trystplace and camp
    where my dearlings lay
 I turned me unknowing the way nor joyed  My soul but in hopes to
    return some day
 Oh listen my friend to the words of love  God forbid thy heart forget
    all I say
 O my soul when thou partest wi them part too  With all joys of life
    nor for living pray

Then he farewelled them and fared on diligently night and day till he
came to Baghdad the House of Peace and Sanctuary of the Abbaside
Caliphs unknowing what had passed during his wayfare At once entering
his house he went in to his mother to salute her but found her worn of
body and wasted of bones for excess of mourning and watching weeping
and wailing till she was grown thin as a toothpick and could not answer
him a word So he dismissed the dromedaries then asked her of his wife
and children and she wept till she fainted and he seeing her in this
state searched the house for them but found no trace of them Then he
went to the storecloset and finding it open and the chest broken and
the featherdress missing knew forthright that his wife had possessed
herself thereof and flown away with her children Then he returned to
his mother and finding her recovered from her fit questioned her of
his spouse and babes whereupon she wept and said O my son may Allah
amply requite thee their loss These are their three tombs When
Hasan heard these words of his mother he shrieked a loud shriek and
fell down in a faintingfit in which he lay from the first of the day
till noontide whereupon anguish was added to his mothers anguish and
she despaired of his life However after awhile he came to himself and
wept and buffeted his face and rent his raiment and went about the house
clean distraught reciting these two couplets

 Folk have made moan of passion before me of past years  And live and
    dead for absence have suffered pains and fears
 But that within my bosom I harbour with mine eyes  Ive never seen the
    like of nor heard with mine ears

Then finishing his verses he bared his brand and coming up to his
mother said to her Except thou tell me the truth of the case I will
strike off thy head and kill myself She replied O my son do not
such deed put up thy sword and sit down till I tell thee what hath
passed So he sheathed his scymitar and sat by her side whilst she
recounted to him all that had happened in his absence from first to
last adding O my son but that I saw her weep in her longing for the
bath and feared that she would go and complain to thee on thy return
and thou wouldst be wroth with me I had never carried her thither and
were it not that the Lady Zubaydah was wroth with me and took the key
from me by force I had never brought out the featherdress though I
died for it But thou knowest O my son that no hand may measure length
with that of the Caliphate When they brought her the dress she took it
and turned it over fancying that somewhat might be lost thereof but
she found it uninjured wherefore she rejoiced and making her children
fast to her waist donned the feathervest after the Lady Zubaydah had
pulled off to her all that was upon herself and clad her therein in
honour of her and because of her beauty No sooner had she donned the
dress than she shook and becoming a bird promenaded about the palace
whilst all who were present gazed at her and marvelled at her beauty and
loveliness Then she flew up to the palace roof and perching thereon
looked at me and saidWhenas thy son cometh to thee and the nights of
separation upon him longsome shall be and he craveth reunion and meeting
to see and whenas the breezes of love and longing shake him dolefully
let him leave his native land and journey to the Islands of Wak and seek
me This then is her story and what befel in thine absenceAnd
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say


       Now when it was the Seven Hundred and Ninetyeighth Night

She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that as soon as
Hasans mother had made an end of her story he gave a great cry and
fell down in a fainting fit which continued till the end of day when he
revived and fell to buffeting his face and writhing on the floor like a
scotched snake His mother sat weeping by his head until midnight when
he came to himself and wept sore and recited these couplets

 Pause ye and see his sorry state since when ye fain withdrew  Haply
    when wrought your cruelty youll have the grace to rue
 For an ye look on him youll doubt of him by sicknessstress  As
    though by Allah he were one before ye never knew
 He dies for nothing save for love of you and he would be  Numbered
    amid the dead did not he moan and groan for you
 And deem not pangs of severance sit all lightly on his soul  Tis
    heavy load on loverwight twere lighter an ye slew

Then having ended his verse he rose and went round about the house
weeping and wailing groaning and bemoaning himself five days during
which he tasted nor meat nor drink His mother came to him and conjured
him till he broke his fast and besought him to leave weeping but he
hearkened not to her and continued to shed tears and lament whilst she
strove to comfort him and he heeded her not Then he recited these
couplets

 Beareth for love a burden sore this soul of me  Could break a mortals
    back however strong that be
 I am distraught to see my case and languor grows  Making my day and
    night indifferent in degree
 I own to having dreaded Death before this day  This day I hold my
    death mine only remedy

And Hasan ceased not to do thus till daybreak when his eyes closed and
he saw in a dream his wife grieffull and repentant for that which she
had done So he started up from sleep crying out and reciting these two
couplets

 Their image bides with me neer quits me neer shall fly  but holds
    within my heart most honourable stead
 But for reunionhope Id see me die forthright  And but for
    phantomform of thee my sleep had fled

And as morning morrowed he redoubled his lamentations He abode
weepingeyed and heavyhearted wakeful by night and eating little for
a whole month at the end of which he bethought him to repair to his
sisters and take counsel with them in the matter of his wife so haply
they might help him to regain her Accordingly he summoned the
dromedaries and loading fifty of them with rarities of AlIrak
committed the house to his mothers care and deposited all his goods in
safe keeping except some few he left at home Then he mounted one of
the beasts and set out on his journey single handed intent upon
obtaining aidance from the Princesses and he stayed not till he reached
the Palace of the Mountain of Clouds when he went in to the damsels and
gave them the presents in which they rejoiced Then they wished him joy
of his safety and said to him O our brother what can ail thee to come
again so soon seeing thou wast with us but two months since Whereupon
he wept and improvised these couplets

 My soul for loss of lover sped I sight  Nor life enjoying neither
    lifes delight
 My case is one whose cure is all unknown  Can any cure the sick but
    doctor wight
 O who hast reft my sleepjoys leaving me  To ask the breeze that blew
    from that fair site
 Blew from my lovers land the land that owns  Those charms so sore a
    grief in soul excite
 O breeze that visitest her land perhaps  Breathing her scent thou
    mayst revive my sprite

And when he ended his verse he gave a great cry and fell down in a
faintingfit The Princesses sat round him weeping over him till he
recovered and repeated these two couplets

 Haply and happily may Fortune bend her rein  Bringing my love for
    Times a freke of jealous strain
 Fortune may prosper me supply mine every want  And bring a blessing
    where before were ban and bane

Then he wept till he fainted again and presently coming to himself
recited the two following couplets

 My wish mine illness mine unease by Allah own  Art thou content
    then I in love contented wone
 Dost thou forsake me thus sans crime or sin  Meet me in ruth I pray
    and be our parting gone

Then he wept till he swooned away once more and when he revived he
repeated these couplets

 Sleep fled me by my side wake ever shows  And hoard of teardrops from
    these eyne aye flows
 For love they weep with beads cornelianlike  And growth of distance
    greater dolence grows
 Lit up my longing O my love in me  Flames burning neath my ribs with
    fiery throes
 Remembering thee a tear I never shed  But in it thunder roars and leven
    glows

Then he wept till he fainted away a fourth time and presently
recovering recited these couplets

 Ah for lowe of love and longing suffer ye as suffer we  Say as pine
    we and as yearn we for you are pining ye
 Allah do the death of Love what a bitter draught is his  Would I wot
    of Love what plans and what projects nurseth he
 Your faces radiantfair though afar from me they shine  Are mirrored
    in our eyes whatsoeer the distance be
 My heart must ever dwell on the memories of your tribe  And the
    turtledove reneweth all as oft as moaneth she
 Ho thou dove who passest nighttide in calling on thy fere  Thou
    doublest my repine bringing grief for company
 And leavest thou mine eyelids with weeping unfulfilled  For the
    dearlings who departed whom we never more may see
 I melt for the thought of you at every time and hour  And I long for
    you when Night showeth cheek of blackest blee

Now when his sister heard these words and saw his condition and how he
lay fainting on the floor she screamed and beat her face and the other
Princesses hearing her scream came out and learning his misfortune and
the transport of love and longing and the passion and distraction that
possessed him they questioned him of his case He wept and told them
what had befallen in his absence and how his wife had taken flight with
her children wherefore they grieved for him and asked him what she said
at leavetaking Answered he O my sisters she said to my mother Tell
thy son whenas he cometh to thee and the nights of severance upon him
longsome shall be and he craveth reunion and meeting to see and whenas
the winds of love and longing shake him dolefully let him fare in the
Islands of Wak to me When they heard his words they signed one to
other with their eyes and shook their heads and each looked at her
sister whilst Hasan looked at them all Then they bowed their heads
groundwards and bethought themselves awhile after which they raised
their heads and said There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in
Allah the Glorious the Great presently adding Put forth thy hand
to heaven and when thou reach thither then shalt thou win to thy
wifeAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her
permitted say


       Now when it was the Seven Hundred and Ninetyninth Night

She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the
Princesses said to Hasan Put forth thy hand to Heaven and when thou
reach thither then shalt thou win to wife and children thereat the
tears ran down his cheeks like rain and wet his clothes and he recited
these couplets

 Pink cheeks and eyes enpupild black have dealt me sore despight  And
    whenas wake overpowered sleep my patience fled in fright
 The fair and sleeklimbed maidens hard of heart withal laid waste  My
    very bones till not a breath is left for man to sight
 Houris who fare with gait of grace as roes oer sandymound  Did
    Allahs saints behold their charms theyd doat thereon forthright
 Faring as fares the garden breeze that bloweth in the dawn  For love
    of them a sore unrest and troubles rack my sprite
 I hung my hopes upon a maid a loveling fair of them  For whom my
    heart still burns with lowe in Lazhell they light
 A dearling soft of sides and haught and graceful in her gait  Her
    grace is white as morning but her hair is black as night
 She stirreth me But ah how many heroes have her cheeks  Upstirred for
    love and eke her eyes that mingle black and white

Then he wept whilst the Princesses wept for his weeping and they were
moved to compassion and jealousy for him So they fell to comforting him
and exhorting him to patience and offering up prayers for his reunion
with his wife whilst his sister said to him O my brother be of good
cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear and be patient so shalt thou
win thy will for whoso hath patience and waiteth that he seeketh
attaineth Patience holdeth the keys of relief and indeed the poet
saith

 Let destiny with slackened rein its course appointed fare And lie thou
    down to sleep by night with heart devoid of care
 For twixt the closing of an eye and th opening thereof God hath it in
    His power to change a case from foul to fair

So hearten thy heart and brace up thy resolve for the son of ten years
dieth not in the ninth Weeping and grief and mourning gender
sickness and disease wherefore do thou abide with us till thou be
rested and I will devise some device for thy winning to thy wife and
children Inshallahso it please Allah the Most High And he wept sore
and recited these verses

 An I be healed of disease in frame  Im unhealed of illness in heart
    and sprite
 There is no healing disease of love  Save lover and loved one to
    reunite

Then he sat down beside her and she proceeded to talk with him and
comfort him and question him of the cause and the manner of his wifes
departure So he told her and she said By Allah O my brother I was
minded to bid thee burn the featherdress but Satan made me forget it
She ceased not to converse with him and caress him and company with him
other ten days whilst sleep visited him not and he delighted not in
food and when the case was longsome upon him and unrest waxed in him
he versified with these couplets

 A beloved familiar oerreigns my heart  And Allahs ruling reigns
    evermore
 She hath all the Arabs united charms  This gazelle who feeds on my
    bosoms core
 Though my skill and patience for love of her fail  I weep whilst I wot
    that tis vain to deplore
 The dearling hath twice seven years as though  She were moon of five
    nights and of five plus four

When the youngest Princess saw him thus distracted for love and
longingfor passion and the feverheat of desire she went in to her
sisterhood weepingeyed and woefulhearted and shedding copious tears
threw herself upon them kissed their feet and besought them to devise
some device for bringing Hasan to the Islands of Wak and effecting his
reunion with his wife and wees She ceased not to conjure them to
further her brother in the accomplishment of his desire and to weep
before them till she made them weep and they said to her Hearten thy
heart we will do our best endeavour to bring about his reunion with his
family Inshallah And he abode with them a whole year during which
his eyes never could retain their tears Now the sisterhood had an
uncle brothergerman to their sire and his name was Abd alKadds or
Slave of the Most Holy and he loved the eldest with exceeding love and
was wont to visit her once a year and do all she desired They had told
him of Hasans adventure with the Magian and how he had been able to
slay him whereat he rejoiced and gave the eldest Princess a pouch
which contained certain perfumes saying O daughter of my brother an
thou be in concern for aught or if aught irk thee or thou stand in any
need cast of these perfumes upon fire naming my name and I will be with
thee forthright and will do thy desire This speech was spoken on the
first of Moharram and the eldest Princess said to one of the
sisterhood Lo the year is wholly past and my uncle is not come Rise
bring me the firesticks and the box of perfumes So the damsel arose
rejoicing and fetching what she sought laid it before her sister who
opened the box and taking thence a little of the perfume cast it into
the fire naming her uncles name nor was it burnt out ere appeared a
dustcloud at the farther end of the Wady and presently lifting it
discovered a Shaykh riding on an elephant which moved at a swift and
easy pace and trumpeted under the rider As soon as he came within
sight of the Princesses he began making signs to them with his hands
and feet nor was it long ere he reached the castle and alighting from
the elephant came in to them whereupon they embraced him and kissed
his hands and saluted him with the salam Then he sat down whilst the
girls talked with him and questioned him of his absence Quoth he I
was sitting but now with my wife your aunt when I smelt the perfumes
and hastened to you on this elephant What wouldst thou O daughter of
my brother Quoth she O uncle indeed we longed for thee as the year
is past and tis not thy wont to be absent from us more than a
twelvemonth Answered he I was busy but I purposed to come to you
tomorrow Wherefore they thanked him and blessed him and sat talking
with himAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her
permitted say


               Now when it was the Eight Hundredth Night

She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the girls sat
down to chat with their uncle the eldest said to him O my uncle we
told thee the tale of Hasan of Bassorah whom Bahram the Magian brought
and how he slew the wizard and how after enduring all manner of
hardships and horrors he made prize of the Supreme Kings daughter and
took her to wife and journeyed with her to his native land Replied he
Yes and what befel him after that Quoth the Princess She played
him false after he was blest with two sons by her for she took them in
his absence and fled with them to her own country saying to his
motherWhenas thy son returneth to thee and asketh for me and upon him
the nights of severance longsome shall be and he craveth reunion and
meeting to see and whenas the breezes of love and longing shake him
dolefully let him come in the Islands of Wak to me When Abd alKaddus
heard this he shook his head and bit his forefinger then bowing his
brow groundwards he began to make marks on the earth with his
fingertips after which he again shook his head and looked right
and left and shook his head a third time whilst Hasan watched him from
a place where he was hidden from him Then said the Princesses to their
uncle Return us some answer for our hearts are rent in sunder But
he shook his head at them saying O my daughters verily hath this man
wearied himself in vain and cast himself into grievous predicament and
sore peril for he may not gain access to the Islands of Wak With this
the Princesses called Hasan who came forth and advancing to Shaykh Abd
alKaddus kissed his hand and saluted him The old man rejoiced in him
and seated him by his side whereupon quoth the damsels O uncle
acquaint our brother Hasan with that thou hast told us So he said to
Hasan O my son put away from thee this peine forte et dure for
thou canst never gain access to the Islands of Wak though the Flying
Jinn and the Wandering Stars were with thee for that betwixt thee and
these islands are seven Wadys and seven seas and seven mighty mountains
How then canst thou come at this stead and who shall bring thee thither
Wherefore Allah upon thee O my son do thou reckon thy spouse and sons
as dead and turn back forthright and weary not thy sprite Indeed I
give thee good counsel an thou wilt but accept it Hearing these words
from the Shaykh Hasan wept till he fainted and the Princesses sat
round him weeping for his weeping whilst the youngest sister rent her
raiment and buffeted her face till she swooned away When Shaykh Abd
alKaddus saw them in this transport of grief and trouble and mourning
he was moved to ruth for them and cried Be ye silent Then said he to
Hasan O my son hearten thy heart and rejoice in the winning of thy
wish an it be the will of Allah the Most High presently adding
Rise O my son take courage and follow me So Hasan arose forthright
and after he had taken leave of the Princesses followed him rejoicing
in the fulfilment of his wish Then the Shaykh called the elephant and
mounting took Hasan up behind him and fared on three days with their
nights like the blinding leven till he came to a vast blue mountain
whose stones were all of azure hue and amiddlemost of which was a
cavern with a door of Chinese iron Here he took Hasans hand and let
him down and alighting dismissed the elephant Then he went up to the
door and knocked whereupon it opened and there came out to him a black
slave hairless as he were an Ifrit with brand in right hand and targe
of steel in left When he saw Abd alKaddus he threw sword and buckler
from his grip and coming up to the Shaykh kissed his hand Thereupon the
old man took Hasan by the hand and entered with him whilst the slave
shut the door behind them when Hasan found himself in a vast cavern and
a spacious through which ran an arched corridor and they ceased not
faring on therein a mile or so till it abutted upon a great open space
and thence they made for an angle of the mountain wherein were two huge
doors cast of solid brass The old man opened one of them and said to
Hasan Sit at the door whilst I go within and come back to thee in
haste and beware lest thou open it and enter Then he fared inside
and shutting the door after him was absent during a full sidereal
hour after which he returned leading a black stallion thin of flank
and short of nose which was ready bridled and saddled with velvet
housings and when it ran it flew and when it flew the very dust in
vain would pursue and brought it to Hasan saying Mount So he
mounted and Abd alKaddus opened the second door beyond which appeared
a vast desert Then the twain passed through the door into that desert
and the old man said to him O my son take this scroll and wend thou
whither this steed will carry thee When thou seest him stop at the door
of a cavern like this alight and throw the reins over the saddlebow
and let him go He will enter the cavern which do thou not enter with
him but tarry at the door five days without being weary of waiting On
the sixth day there will come forth to thee a black Shaykh clad all in
sable with a long white beard flowing down to his navel As soon as
thou seest him kiss his hands and seize his skirt and lay it on thy head
and weep before him till he take pity on thee and he will ask thee what
thou wouldst have When he saith to thee What is thy want give him
this scroll which he will take without speaking and go in and leave
thee Wait at the door other five days without wearying and on the
sixth day expect him and if he come out to thee himself know that thy
wish will be won but if one of his pages come forth to thee know that
he who cometh forth to thee purposeth to kill thee andthe Peace
For know O my son that whoso self imperilleth doeth himself to
deathAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her
permitted say


           Now when it was the Eight Hundred and First Night

She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that after
handing the scroll to Hasan Shaykh Abd alKaddus told him what would
befal him and said Whoso self imperilleth doeth himself to death but
also who ventureth naught advantageth naught However an thou fear for
thy life cast it not into danger of destruction but an thou fear not
up and do thy will for I have expounded to thee the whole case Yet
shouldest thou be minded to return to thy friends the elephant is still
here and he will carry thee to my nieces who will restore thee to thy
country and return thee to thy home and Allah will vouchsafe thee a
better than this girl of whom thou art enamoured Hasan answered the
Shaykh saying And how shall life be sweet to me except I win my
wish By Allah I will never turn back till I regain my beloved or my
death overtake me And he wept and recited these couplets

 For loss of lover mine and stress of love I dree  I stood bewailing
    self in deep despondency
 Longing for him the Springcamps dust I kissed and kissed  But this
    bred more of grief and galling reverie
 God guard the gone who in our hearts must eer abide  With nearing
    woes and joys which still the farther flee
 They say me Patience But they bore it all away  On partingday
    and left me naught save tormentry
 And naught affrighted me except the word he said  Forget me not when
    gone nor drive from memory
 To whom shall turn I hope in whom when you are lost  Who were my only
    hopes and joys and woes of me
 But ah the pang of homereturn when parting thus  How joyed at seeing
    me return mine enemy
 Then wellaway this twas I guarded me against  And ah thou lowe of
    Love double thine ardency
 An fled for aye my friends Ill not survive the flight  Yet an they
    deign return Oh joy Oh ecstacy
 Never by Allah tears and weeping Ill contain  For loss of you but
    tears on tears and tears will rain

When Abd alKaddus heard his verse he knew that he would not turn back
from his desire nor would words have effect on him and was certified
that naught would serve him but he must imperil himself though it lose
him his life So he said to him Know O my son that the Islands of
Wak are seven islands wherein is a mighty host all virgin girls and
the Inner Isles are peopled by Satans and Marids and warlocks and
various tribesmen of the Jinn and whoso entereth their land never
returneth thence at least none hath done so to this day So Allah upon
thee return presently to thy people for know that she whom thou
seekest is the Kings daughter of all these islands and how canst thou
attain to her Hearken to me O my son and haply Allah will vouchsafe
thee in her stead a better than she O my lord answered Hasan
though for the love of her I were cut in pieces yet should I but
redouble in love and transport There is no help but that I enter the
Wak Islands and come to the sight of my wife and children and
Inshallah I will not return save with her and with them Said the
Shaykh Then nothing will serve thee but thou must make the journey
Hasan replied Nothing and I only ask of thee thy prayers for help and
aidance so haply Allah will reunite me with my wife and children right
soon Then he wept for stress of longing and recited these couplets

 You are my wish of creatures brightestlight  I deem you lief as
    hearing fain as sight
 You hold my heart which hath become your home  And since you left me
    lords right sores my plight
 Then think not I have yielded up your love  Your love which set this
    wretch in fierce affright
 You went and went my joy whenas you went  And waned and waxd wan the
    brightest light
 You left me lone to watch the stars in woe  Railing tears likest
    raindrops infinite
 Thourt longsome to the wight who pining lies  On wake moongazing
    through the night O Night
 Wind an thou pass the tribe where they abide  Give them my greeting
    life is fain of flight
 And tell them somewhat of the pangs I bear  The loved one kenneth not
    my case aright

Then he wept with sore weeping till he fainted away and when he came to
himself Shaykh Abd alKaddus said to him O my son thou hast a
mother make her not taste the torment of thy loss Hasan replied By
Allah O my lord I will never return except with my wife or my death
shall overtake me And he wept and wailed and recited these couplets

 By Loves right naught of farness thy slave can estrange  Nor am I
    one to fail in my fealty
 I suffer such pains did I tell my case  To folk theyd cry Madness
    clean witless is he
 Then ecstasy lovelonging transport and lowe  Whose case is such
    case how shall ever he be

With this the old man knew that he would not turn from his purpose
though it cost him his life so he handed him the scroll and prayed for
him and charged him how he should do saying I have in this letter
given a strict charge concerning thee to Ab alRuwaysh son of
Bilks daughter of Mun for he is my Shaykh and my teacher and all
men and Jinn humble themselves to him and stand in awe of him And now
go with the blessing of God Hasan forthright set out giving the horse
the rein and it flew off with him swiftlier than lightning and stayed
not in its course ten days when he saw before him a vast loom black as
night walling the world from East to West As he neared it the
stallion neighed under him whereupon there flocked to it horses in
number as the drops of rain none could tell their tale or against them
prevail and fell to rubbing themselves against it Hasan was affrighted
at them and fared forwards surrounded by the horses without drawing
rein till he came to the cavern which Shaykh Abd alKaddus had described
to him The steed stood still at the door and Hasan alighted and bridged
the bridle over the saddlebow whereupon the steed entered the
cavern whilst the rider abode without as the old man had charged him
pondering the issue of his case in perplexity and distraction and
unknowing what would befal himAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day
and ceased to say her permitted say


          Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Second Night

She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that Hasan
dismounting from the steed stood at the cavernmouth pondering the
issue of his case and unknowing what might befal him He abode standing
on the same spot five days with their nights sleepless mournful
tearfuleyed distracted perplexed pondering his severance from home
and family comrades and friends with weeping eyelids and heavy heart
Then he bethought him of his mother and of what might yet happen to him
and of his separation from his wife and children and of all that he had
suffered and he recited these couplets

 With you is my heartcure a heart that goes  And from hillfoot of
    eyelids the tearrill flows
 And parting and sorrow and exile and dole  And farness from country and
    throe that oerthrows
 Naught am I save a lover distracted by love  Far parted from loved one
    and wilted by woes
 And tis Love that hath brought me such sorrow say where  Is the noble
    of soul who such sorrow unknows

Hardly had Hasan made an end of his verses when out came the Shaykh Abu
alRuwaysh a blackamoor and clad in black raiment and at first sight
he knew him by the description that Abd alKaddus had given him He
threw himself at his feet and rubbed his cheeks on them and seizing his
skirt laid it on his head and wept before him Quoth the old man What
wantest thou O my son Whereupon he put out his hand to him with the
letter and Abu alRuwaysh took it and reentered the cavern without
making him any answer So Hasan sat down at the cavemouth in his place
other five days as he had been bidden whilst concern grew upon him and
terror redoubled on him and restlessness gat hold of him and he fell to
weeping and bemoaning himself for the anguish of estrangement and much
watching And he recited these couplets

 Glory to Him who guides the skies  The lover sore in sorrow lies
 Who hath not tasted of Loves food  Knows not what mean its miseries
 Did I attempt to stem my tears  Rivers of blood would fount and rise
 How many an intimate is hard  Of heart and pains in sorest wise
 An she with me her word would keep  Of tears and sighs Id fain
    devise
 But Im forgone rejected quite  Ruin on me hath cast her eyes
 At my fell pangs fell wildlings weep  And not a bird for me but cries

Hasan ceased not to weep till dawn of the sixth day when Shaykh Abu
alRuwaysh came forth to him clad in white raiment and with his hand
signed to him to enter So he went in rejoicing and assured of the
winning of his wish and the old man took him by the hand and leading
him into the cavern fared on with him half a days journey till they
reached an arched doorway with a door of steel The Shaykh opened the
door and they two entered a vestibule vaulted with onyx stones and
arabesqued with gold and they stayed not walking till they came to a
great hall and a wide paved and walled with marble In its midst was a
flowergarden containing all manner trees and flowers and fruits with
birds warbling on the boughs and singing the praises of Allah the
Almighty Sovran and there were four dases each facing other and in
each das a jetting fountain at whose corners stood lions of red gold
spouting gerbes from their mouths into the basin On each das stood a
chair whereon sat an elder with exceeding store of books before
him and censers of gold containing fire and perfumes and before
each elder were students who read the books to him Now when the twain
entered the elders rose to them and did them honour whereupon Abu
alRuwaysh signed to them to dismiss their scholars and they did so
Then the four arose and seating themselves before that Shaykh asked him
of the case of Hasan to whom he said Tell the company thy tale and all
that hath betided thee from the beginning of thine adventure to the
end So Hasan wept with sore weeping and related to them his story with
Bahram whereupon all the Shaykhs cried out and said Is this indeed he
whom the Magian caused to climb the Mountain of Clouds by means of the
vultures sewn up in the camelhide And Hasan said Yes So they
turned to the Shaykh Abu alRuwaysh and said to him O our Shaykh of a
truth Bahram contrived his mounting to the mountaintop but how came he
down and what marvels saw he there And Abu alRuwaysh said O Hasan
tell them how thou camest down and acquaint them with what thou sawest
of marvels So he told them all that had befallen him first and last
how he had gotten the Magian into his power and slain him how he had
delivered the youth from him and sent him back to his own country and
how he had captured the Kings daughter of the Jinn and married her yet
had she played him false and taken the two boys she had borne him and
flown away brief he related to them all the hardships and horrors he
had undergone whereat they marvelled each and every and said to Abu
alRuwaysh O elder of elders verily by Allah this youth is to be
pitied But belike thou wilt aid him to recover his wife and weesAnd
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say


           Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Third Night

She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Hasan told
his tale to the elders they said to Shaykh Abu alRuwaysh This youth
is to be pitied and haply thou wilt aid him to recover his wife and
wees He replied O my brothers in very sooth this is a grave matter
and a perilous and never saw I any loathe his life save this youth You
know that the Islands of Wak are hard of access and that none may come
to them but at risk of life and ye know also the strength of their
people and their guards Moreover I have sworn an oath not to tread
their soil nor transgress against them in aught so how shall this man
come at the daughter of the Great King and who hath power to bring him
to her or help him in this matter Replied the other O Shaykh of
Shaykhs verily this man is consumed with desire and he hath endangered
himself to bring thee a scroll from thy brother Abd alKaddus wherefore
it behoveth thee to help him And Hasan arose and kissed Abu
alRuwayshs feet and raising the hem of his garment laid it on his
head weeping and crying I beseech thee by Allah to reunite me with
my wife and children though it cost me my life and my soul The four
elders all wept for his weeping and said to Abu alRuwaysh Deal
generously with this unhappy and show him kindness for the sake of thy
brother Abd alKaddus and profit by this occasion to earn reward from
Allah for helping him Quoth he This wilful youth weeteth not what he
undertaketh but Inshallah we will help him after the measure of our
means nor leave aught feasible undone When Hasan heard the Shaykhs
words he rejoiced and kissed the hands of the five elders one after
other imploring their aidance Thereupon Abd alRuwaysh took inkcase
and a sheet of paper and wrote a letter which he sealed and gave to
Hasan together with a pouch of perfumed leather containing
incense and firesticks and other needs and said to him Take
strictest care of this pouch and whenas thou fallest into any strait
burn a little of the incense therein and name my name whereupon I will
be with thee forthright and save thee from thy stress Moreover he
bade one of those present fetch him an Ifrit of the Flying Jinn and he
did so incontinently whereupon quoth Abu alRuwaysh to the firedrake
What is thy name Replied the Ifrit Thy thrall is hight Dahnash bin
Faktash And the Shaykh said Draw near to me So Dahnash drew near to
him and he put his mouth to his ear and said somewhat to him whereat
the Ifrit shook his head and answered I accept O elder of elders
Then said Abu alRuwaysh to Hasan Arise O my son mount the shoulders
of this Ifrit Dahnash the Flyer but when he heaveth thee heavenwards
and thou hearest the angels glorifying God awelkin with Subhna
llh have a care lest thou do the like else wilt thou perish and he
too Hasan replied I will not say a word no never and the old man
continued O Hasan after faring with thee all this day tomorrow at
peep of dawn he will set thee down in a land cleanly white like unto
camphor whereupon do thou walk on ten days by thyself till thou come
to the gate of a city Then enter and enquire for the King of the city
and when thou comest to his presence salute him with the salam and kiss
his hand then give him this scroll and consider well whatso he shall
counsel thee Hasan replied Hearing and obeying and rose up and
mounted the Ifrits shoulders whilst the elders rose and offered up
prayers for him and commended him to the care of Dahnash the Firedrake
And when he had perched on the Flyers back the Ifrit soared with him to
the very confines of the sky till he heard the angels glorifying God in
Heaven and flew on with him a day and a night till at dawn of the next
day he set him down in a land white as camphor and went his way
leaving him there When Hasan found himself in the land aforesaid with
none by his side he fared on night and day for ten days till he came to
the gate of the city in question and entering enquired for the King
They directed him to him and told him that his name was King
Hassn Lord of the Land of Camphor and that he had troops and
soldiers enough to fill the earth in its length and breadth So he
sought audience of him and being admitted to his presence found him a
mighty King and kissed ground between his hands Quoth the King What
is thy want Whereupon Hasan kissed the letter and gave it to him The
King read it and shook his head awhile then said to one of his
officers Take this youth and lodge him in the house of hospitality
So he took him and stablished him in the guesthouse where he tarried
three days eating and drinking and seeing none but the eunuch who
waited on him and who entertained him with discourse and cheered him
with his company questioning him of his case and how he came to that
city whereupon he told him his whole story and the perilous condition
wherein he was On the fourth day that eunuch carried him before the
King who said to him O Hasan thou comest to me seeking to enter the
Islands of Wak as the Shaykh of Shaykhs adviseth me O my son I would
send thee thither this very day but that by the way are many perils and
thirsty wolds full of terrors yet do thou have patience and naught save
fair shall befal thee for needs must I devise to bring thee to thy
desire Inshallah Know O my son that here is a mighty host
equipped with arms and steeds and warlike gear who long to enter the
Wak Islands and lack power thereto But O my son for the sake of the
Shaykh Abu alRuwaysh son of Bilkis the daughter of Muin I may
not send thee back to him unfulfilled of thine affair Presently there
will come to us ships from the Islands of Wak and the first that shall
arrive I will send thee on board of her and give thee in charge to the
sailors so they may take care of thee and carry thee to the Islands If
any question thee of thy case and condition answer him sayingI am
kinsman to King Hassun Lord of the Land of Camphor and when the ship
shall make fast to the shore of the Islands of Wak and the master shall
bid thee land do thou land Now as soon as thou comest ashore thou
wilt see a multitude of wooden settles all about the beach of which do
thou choose thee one and crouch under it and stir not And when dark
night sets in thou wilt see an army of women appear and flock about the
goods landed from the ship and one of them will sit down on the settle
under which thou hast hidden thyself whereupon do thou put forth thy
hand to her and take hold of her and implore her protection And know
thou O my son that an she accord thee protection thou wilt win thy
wish and regain thy wife and children but if she refuse to protect
thee make thy mourning for thyself and give up all hope of life and
make sure of death for indeed thou art a dead man Understand O my son
that thou adventurest thy life and this is all I can do for thee
andthe peaceAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to
say her permitted say


          Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Fourth Night

She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that King Hassun spake
these words to Hasan and charged him as we have related ending with
This is all I can do for thee and know that except the Lord of Heaven
had aided thee thou hadst not come hither The youth wept till he
swooned away and when he recovered he recited these two couplets

 A term decreed my lot I spy  And when its days shall end I die
 Though lions fought with me in lair  If Time be mine Id beat them I

Then having ended his verse he kissed the ground before the Sovran and
said to him O mighty King how many days remain till the coming of the
ships Replied the other In a months time they will come and will
tarry here selling their cargason other two months after which they
will return to their own country so hope not to set out save after
three whole months Then the King bade him return to the house of
hospitality and bade supply him with all that he needed of meat and
drink and raiment fit for Kings Hasan abode in the guesthouse a month
at the end of which the vessels arrived and the King and the merchants
went forth to them taking Hasan with them Amongst them he saw a ship
with much people therein like the shingles for number none knew their
tale save He who created them She was anchored in midharbour and had
cocks which transported her lading to the shore So Hasan abode till the
crew had landed all the goods and sold and bought and to the time of
departure there wanted but three days whereupon the King sent for him
and equipped him with all he required and gave him great gifts after
which he summoned the captain of the great ship and said to him Take
this youth with thee in the vessel so none may know of him save thou
and carry him to the Islands of Wak and leave him there and bring him
not back And the Rais said To hear is to obey with love and
gladness Then quoth the King to Hasan Look thou tell none of those
who are with thee in the ship thine errand nor discover to them aught of
thy case else thou art a lost man and quoth he Hearing and
obedience With this he farewelled the King after he had wished him
long life and victory over his enviers and his enemies wherefore the
King thanked him and wished him safety and the winning of his wish Then
he committed him to the captain who laid him in a chest which he
embarked in a dinghy and bore him aboard whilst the folk were busy in
breaking bulk and no man doubted but the chest contained somewhat of
merchandise After this the vessels set sail and fared on without
ceasing ten days and on the eleventh day they made the land So the
Rais set Hasan ashore and as he walked up the beach he saw wooden
settles without number none knew their count save Allah even as
the King had told him He went on till he came to one that had no
fellow and hid under it till nightfall when there came up a mighty many
of women as they were locusts overswarming the land and they marched
afoot and armed cappie in hauberks and straitknit coats of mail
hending drawn swords in their hands who seeing the merchandise landed
from the ships busied themselves therewith Presently they sat down to
rest themselves and one of them seated herself on the settle under
which Hasan had crouched whereupon he took hold of the hem of her
garment and laid it on his head and throwing himself before her fell to
kissing her hands and feet and weeping and crying Thy protection thy
goodwill Quoth she Ho thou Arise and stand up ere any see thee
and slay thee So he came forth and springing up kissed her hands and
wept and said to her O my mistress I am under thy protection
adding Have ruth on one who is parted from his people and wife and
children one who hath haste to rejoin them and one who adventureth life
and soul for their sake Take pity on me and be assured that therefor
Paradise will be thy reward or an thou wilt not receive me I beseech
thee by Allah the Great the Concealer to conceal my case The
merchants stared to see him talking with her and she hearing his words
and beholding his humility was moved to ruth for him her heart
inclined to him and she knew that he had not ventured himself and come
to that place save for a grave matter So she said to him O my son
be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear hearten thy heart
and take courage and return to thy hidingplace till the coming night
and Allah shall do as He will Then she took leave of him and Hasan
crept under the wooden settle as before whilst the troops lighted
flambeaux of wax mixed with aloeswood and Naddperfume and crude
ambergris and passed the night in sport and delight till the
morning At daybreak the boats returned to the shore and the merchants
busied themselves with buying and selling and the transport of the goods
and gear till nightfall whilst Hasan lay hidden beneath the settle
weepingeyed and woefulhearted knowing not what was decreed to him in
the secret preordainment of Allah As he was thus behold the
merchantwoman with whom he had taken refuge came up to him and giving
him a habergeon and a helmet a spear a sword and a gilded girdle bade
him don them and seat himself on the settle after which she left him
for fear of the troops So he arose and donned the mailcoat and helmet
and clasped the girdle about his middle then he slung the sword over
his shoulder till it hung under his armpit and taking the spear in his
hand sat down on that settle whilst his tongue neglected not to name
Allah Almighty and call on Him for protectionAnd Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say


           Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Fifth Night

She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Hasan
received the weapons which the merchantwoman had given to him saying
Sit thee upon the settle and let none wot thy case he armed himself
and took his seat whilst his tongue neglected not to name Allah
Almighty and to call upon Him for protection And behold there appeared
cressets and lanthorns and flambeaux and up came the army of women So
he arose and mingling with them became as one of them A little before
daybreak they set out and Hasan with them and fared on till they came
to their camp where they dispersed each to her tent and Hasan followed
one of them and lo it was hers for whose protection he had prayed
When she entered she threw down her arms and doffed her hauberk and
veil So Hasan did the like and looking at his companion saw her to be
a grizzled old woman blueeyed and bignosed a calamity of calamities
the foulest of all created things with face pockmarked and eyebrows
bald gaptoothed and chapfallen with hair hoary nose running and
mouth slavering even as saith the like of her the poet

 In her cheekcorners nine calamities  Wone and when shown each one
    Jehannam is
 Hideous the face and favour foulest foul  As cheek of hog yea tis a
    cesspool phiz

And indeed she was like a pied snake or a scald shewolf Now when the
old woman looked at Hasan she marvelled and said How came this one to
these lands and in which of the ships was he and how arrived he hither
in safety And she fell to questioning him of his case and admiring at
his arrival whereupon he fell at her feet and rubbed his face on them
and wept till he fainted and when he recovered himself he recited
these couplets

 When will Time grant we meet when shall we be  Again united after
    severance stark
 And I shall win my choicest wish and view  Blame end and Love abide
    without remark
 Were Nile to flow as freely as my tears  Twould leave no region but
    with watermark
 Twould overthrow Hijaz and Egyptland  Twould deluge Syria and
    twould drown Irak
 This O my love is caused by thy disdain  Be kind and promise meeting
    fair and fain

Then he took the crones skirt and laid it on his head and fell to
weeping and craving her protection When she saw his ardency and
transport and anguish and distress her heart softened to him and she
promised him her safeguard saying Have no fear whatsoever Then she
questioned him of his case and he told her the manner of his coming
thither and all that had befallen him from beginning to end whereat she
marvelled and said This that hath betide thee methinks never betided
any save thyself and except thou hadst been vouchsafed the especial
protection of Allah thou hadst not been saved but now O my son take
comfort and be of good courage thou hast nothing more to fear for
indeed thou hast won thy wish and attained thy desire if it please the
Most High Thereat Hasan rejoiced with joy exceeding and she sent to
summon the captains of the army to her presence and it was the last day
of the month So they presented themselves and the old woman said to
them Go out and proclaim to all the troops that they come forth
tomorrow at daybreak and let none tarry behind for whoso tarryeth
shall be slain They replied We hear and we obey and going forth
made proclamation to all the host anent a review next morning even as
she bade them after which they returned and told her of this whereby
Hasan knew that she was the Commanderinchief of the army and the
Viceregent in authority over them and her name was Shawah the
Fascinator entituled Umm alDawhi or Mother of Calamities She
ceased not to bid and forbid and Hasan doffed not off his arms from his
body that day Now when the morning broke all the troops fared forth
from their places but the old woman came not out with them and as soon
as they were sped and the stead was clear of them she said to Hasan
Draw near unto me O my son So he drew near unto her and stood
between her hands Quoth she Why and wherefore hast thou adventured
thyself so boldly as to enter this land and how came thy soul to
consent to its own undoing Tell me the truth and the whole truth and
fear aught of ill come of it for thou hast my plighted word and I am
moved to compassion for thy case and pity thee and have taken thee under
my protection So if thou tell me the truth I will help thee to win
thy wish though it involve the undoing of souls and the destruction of
bodies and since thou hast come to seek me no hurt shall betide thee
from me nor will I suffer any to have at thee with harm of all who be
in the Islands of Wak So he told her his tale from first to last
acquainting her with the matter of his wife and of the birds how he had
captured her as his prize from amongst the ten and married her and abode
with her till she had borne him two sons and how she had taken her
children and flown away with them whenas she knew the way to the
featherdress Brief he concealed from her no whit of his case from
the beginning to that day But when Shawahi heard his relation she
shook her head and said to him Glory be to God who hath brought thee
hither in safety and made thee hap upon me For hadst thou happened on
any but myself thou hadst lost thy life without winning thy wish but
the truth of thine intent and thy fond affection and the excess of thy
lovelonging for thy wife and yearning for thy children these it was
that have brought thee to the attainment of thine aim Didst thou not
love her and love her to distraction thou hadst not thus imperilled
thyself and AlhamdolillahPraised be Allahfor thy safety Wherefore it
behoveth us to do thy desire and conduce to thy quest so thou mayst
presently attain that thou seekest if it be the will of Almighty Allah
But know O my son that thy wife is not here but in the seventh of the
Islands of Wak and between us and it is seven months journey night and
day From here we go to an island called the Land of Birds wherein for
the loud crying of the birds and the flapping of their wings one cannot
hear other speakAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased
to say her permitted say


           Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Sixth Night

She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that the old woman
said to Hasan Indeed thy wife is in the Seventh Island the
greatest amongst the Islands of Wak and betwixt us and it is a
sevenmonths journey From here we fare for the Land of Birds whereon
for the force of their flying and the flapping of their wings we cannot
hear one other speak Over that country we journey night and day eleven
days after which we come forth of it to another called the Land of
Ferals where for stress of roaring of lions and howling of wolves and
laughing of hynas and the crying of other beasts of prey we shall hear
naught and therein we travel twenty days journey Then we issue
therefrom and come to a third country called the Land of the Jnn
where for stress of the crying of the Jinn and the flaming of fires and
the flight of sparks and smoke from their mouths and the noise of their
groaning and their arrogance in blocking up the road before us our ears
will be deafened and our eyes blinded so that we shall neither hear nor
see nor dare any look behind him or he perisheth but there horseman
boweth head on saddlebow and raiseth it not for three days After this
we abut upon a mighty mountain and a running river contiguous with the
Isles of Wak which are seven in number and the extent whereof is a
whole years journey for a wellgirt horseman And thou must know O my
son that these troops are all virgin girls and that the ruler over us
is a woman of the Archipelago of Wak On the bank of the river aforesaid
is another mountain called Mount Wak and it is thus named by reason of
a tree which beareth fruits like heads of the Sons of Adam When
the sun riseth on them the heads cry out all saying in their
criesWak Wak Glory be to the Creating King AlKhallk And when we
hear their crying we know that the sun is risen In like manner at
sundown the heads set up the same cry Wak Wak Glory to AlKhallak
and so we know that the sun hath set No man may abide with us or reach
to us or tread our earth and betwixt us and the abidingplace of the
Queen who ruleth over us is a months journey from this shore all the
lieges whereof are under her hand as are also the tribes of the Jinn
Marids and Satans while of the warlocks none kenneth the number save He
who created them Wherefore an thou be afraid I will send with thee
one who will convey thee to the coast and there bring one who will
embark thee on board a ship that bear thee to thine own land But an
thou be content to tarry with us I will not forbid thee and thou shalt
be with me in mine eye till thou win thy wish Inshallah Quoth
he O my lady I will never quit thee till I foregather with my wife or
lose my life and quoth she This is a light matter be of good
heart for soon shalt thou come to thy desire Allah willing and there
is no help but that I let the Queen know of thee that she may help thee
to attain thine aim Hasan blessed her and kissed her head and hands
thanking her for her good deed and exceeding kindness and firm will
Then he set out with her pondering the issue of his case and the
horrors of his strangerhood wherefore he fell aweeping and awailing
and recited these couplets

 A Zephyr bloweth from the lovers site  And thou canst view me in the
    saddest plight
 The Night of Union is as brilliant morn  And black the Severanceday
    as blackest night
 Farewelling friend is sorrow sorest sore  Parting from lovers merest
    undelight
 I will not blame her harshness save to her  And mid mankind nor
    friend nor fere I sight
 How can I be consoled for loss of you  Base censors blame shall not
    console my sprite
 O thou in charms unique uniques my love  O peerless thou my heart
    hath peerless might
 Who maketh semblance that he loveth you  And dreadeth blame is most
    blameworthy wight

Then the old woman bade beat the kettledrums for departure and the army
set out Hasan fared with her drowned in the sea of solicitude and
reciting verses like those above whilst she strave to comfort him and
exhorted him to patience but he awoke not from his tristesse and heeded
not her exhortations They journeyed thus till they came to the
boundaries of the Land of Birds and when they entered it it seemed
to Hasan as if the world were turned topsyturvy for the exceeding
clamour His head ached and his mind was dazed his eyes were blinded
and his ears deafened and he feared with exceeding fear and made
certain of death saying to himself If this be the Land of Birds how
will be the Land of Beasts But when the crone hight Shawahi saw him
in this plight she laughed at him saying O my son if this be thy
case in the first island how will it fare with thee when thou comest
to the others So he prayed to Allah and humbled himself before the
Lord beseeching Him to assist him against that wherewith He had
afflicted him and bring him to his wishes and they ceased not going
till they passed out of the Land of Birds and traversing the Land of
Beasts came to the Land of the Jann which when Hasan saw he was sore
affrighted and repented him of having entered it with them But he
sought aid of Allah the Most High and fared on with them till they were
quit of the Land of the Jann and came to the river and set down their
loads at the foot of a vast mountain and a lofty and pitched their
tents by the streambank Then they rested and ate and drank and slept
in security for they were come to their own country On the morrow the
old woman set Hasan a couch of alabaster inlaid with pearls and jewels
and nuggets of red gold by the riverside and he sat down thereon
having first bound his face with a chinkerchief that discovered naught
of him but his eyes Then she bade proclaim among the troops that they
should all assemble before her tent and put off their clothes and go
down into the stream and wash and this she did that she might parade
before him all the girls so haply his wife should be amongst them and
he know her So the whole army mustered before her and putting off their
clothes went down into the stream and Hasan seated on his couch
watched them washing their white skins and frolicking and making merry
whilst they took no heed of his inspecting them deeming him to be of
the daughters of the Kings When he beheld them stripped of their
clothes his chord stiffened for that looking at them mothernaked he
saw what was between their thighs and that of all kinds soft and
rounded plump and cushioned largelipped perfect redundant and
ample and their faces were as moons and their hair as night upon
day for that they were of the daughters of the Kings When they were
clean they came up out of the water stark naked as the moon on the
night of fullness and the old woman questioned Hasan of them company by
company if his wife were among them but as often as she asked him of
a troop he made answer She is not among these O my ladyAnd
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say


          Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Seventh Night

She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that the old woman
questioned Hasan of the girls company after company if haply his wife
were among them but as often as she asked him of a troop he made
answer She is not among these O my lady Last of all there came up
a damsel attended by ten slavegirls and thirty waitingwomen all of
them highbosomed maidens They put off their clothes and went down into
the river where the damsel fell to riding the high horse over her
women throwing them down and ducking them On this wise she continued
for a full hour after which all came up out of the water and sat down
and they brought her napkins of goldpurfled silk with which she
dried herself Then they brought her clothes and jewels and ornaments of
the handiwork of the Jinn and she donned them and rose and walked with
graceful pace among the troops she and her maidens When Hasan saw her
his heart was ready to fly from his breast and he said Verily this
girl is the likest of all folk to the bird I saw in the basin atop of
the palace of my sisters the Princesses and she lorded it over her
lieges even as doth this one The old woman asked O Hasan is this
thy wife and he answered No by thy life O my lady this is not my
wife nor ever in my life have I set eyes on her neither among all the
girls I have seen in these islands is there the like of my wife nor her
match for symmetry and grace and beauty and loveliness Then said
Shawaki Describe her to me and acquaint me with all her attributes
that I may have her in my mind for I know every girl in the Islands of
Wak being commander of the army of maids and governor over them
wherefore an thou describe her to me I shall know her and will
contrive for thee to take her Quoth he My wife hath the fairest face
and a form all grace smooth is she of cheeks and high of breasts with
eyes of liquid light calves and thighs plump to sight teeth snowy
white with dulcet speech dight in speech soft and bland as she were a
willowwand her gifts are a moral and lips are red as coral her eyes
wear natural Kohldye and her lower labia in softness lie On her
right cheek is a mole and on her waist under her navel is a sign her
face shines as the rondure of the moon in sheen her waist is slight
her hips a heavy weight and the water of her mouth the sick doth heal
as it were Kausar or Salsabil Said the old woman Give me an
increased account of her Allah increase thee of passion for her Quoth
he My wife hath a face the fairest fair and oval cheeks the rarest
rare neck long and spare and eyes that Kohl wear her side face shows
the Anemones of Nuuman her mouth is like a seal of cornelian and
flashing teeth that lure and stand one in stead of cup and ewer She is
cast in the mould of pleasantness and between her thighs is the throne
of the Caliphate there is no such sanctuary among the Holy Places as
saith in its praise the poet

Illustration

 The name of what drave me distraught  Hath letters renowned among men
 A four into five multiplied  And a multiplied six into ten

Then Hasan wept and chanted the following Mawwl

 O heart an lover false thee shun the parting bane  Nor to
    forgetfulness thy thoughts constrain
 Be patient thou shalt bury all thy foes  Allah neer falseth man of
    patience fain

And this also

 An wouldst be lifelong safe vaunt not delight  Never despair nor
    wone oerjoyed in sprite
 Forbear rejoice not mourn not oer thy plight  And in ill day Have
    not we opedrecite

Thereupon the old woman bowed her head groundwards awhile then raising
it said Laud be to the Lord the Mighty of Award Indeed I am
afflicted with thee O Hasan Would Heaven I had never known thee This
woman whom thou describest to me as thy wife I know by description and
I know her to be none other than the eldest daughter of the Supreme
King she who ruleth over all the Islands of Wak So open both eyes and
consider thy case and if thou be asleep awake for if this woman be
indeed thy wife it is impossible for thee ever to obtain her and
though thou come to her yet couldst thou not avail to her possession
since between thee and her the distance is as that between earth and
Heaven Wherefore O my son return presently and cast not thyself into
destruction nor cast me with thee for meseemeth thou hast no lot in
her so return whence thou camest lest our lives be lost And she
feared for herself and for him When Hasan heard her words he wept till
he fainted and she left not sprinkling water on his face till he came
to himself when he continued to weep so that he drenched his dress
with tears for the much cark and care and chagrin which betided him by
reason of her words And indeed he despaired of life and said to the old
woman O my lady and how shall I go back after having come hither
Verily I thought not thou wouldst forsake me nor fail of the winning of
my wish especially as thou art the Commanderinchief of the army of
the girls Answered Shawahi O my son I doubted not but thy wife was
a maid of the maids and had I known she was the Kings daughter I had
not suffered thee to come hither nor had I shown the troops to thee for
all the love I bear thee But now O my son thou hast seen all the
girls naked so tell me which of them pleaseth thee and I will give her
to thee in lieu of thy wife and do thou put it that thy wife and
children are dead and take her and return to thine own country in
safety ere thou fall into the Kings hand and I have no means of
delivering thee So Allah upon thee O my son hearken unto me Choose
thyself one of these damsels in the stead of yonder woman and return
presently to thy country in safety and cause me not quaff the cup of
thine anguish For by Allah thou hast cast thyself into affliction
sore and peril galore wherefrom none may avail to deliver thee
evermore But Hasan hung down his head and wept with long weeping and
recited these couplets

 Blame not said I to all who blamd me  Mine eyelids naught but
    tears were made to dree
 The tears that brim these orbs have overflowed  My cheeks for lovers
    and loves cruelty
 Leave me to love though waste this form of me  For I of Love adore the
    insanity
 And Oh my dearling passion grows on me  For youand you why grudge
    me clemency
 You wronged me after swearing troth and plight  Falsed my
    companionship and turned to flee
 And cup of humbling for your rigours sore  Ye made me drain what day
    departed ye
 Then melt O heart with longing for their sight  And O mine eyes
    with crowns of tears be dight

And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her
permitted say


          Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Eighth Night

She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the old woman
said to Hasan By Allah O my son hearken to my words Choose thee one
of these girls in lieu of thy wife and presently return to thy country
in safety he hung down his head and recited the couplets quoted above
Then he wept till he swooned away and Shawahi sprinkled water on his
face till he revived when she addressed him O my lord I have no
shift left because if I carry thee to the city thy life is lost and
mine also for when the Queen cometh to know of this she will blame me
for admitting thee into her lands and islands whereto none of Adams
sons hath access and will slay me for bringing thee with me and for
suffering mortal to look upon the virgins seen by thee in the sea whom
neer touched male neither approached mate And Hasan sware that he
had never looked on them with evil of eye She resumed O my son
hearken to me and return to thy country and I will give thee wealth and
treasures and things of price such as shall suffice thee for all the
women in the world Moreover I will give thee a girl of the best of
them so lend an ear to my words and return presently and imperil not
thyself indeed I counsel thee with good counsel But he wept and
rubbed both cheeks against her feet saying O my lady and mistress and
coolth of mine eyes how can I turn back now that I have made my way
hither without the sight of those I desire and now that I have come
near the beloveds site hoping for meeting forthright so haply there
may be a portion in reunion to my plight And he improvised these
couplets

 O Kings of beauty grace to prisoner taen  Of eyelids fit to rule the
    Chosros reign
 Ye pass the wafts of musk in perfumed breath  Your cheeks the charms
    of blooming rose disdain
 The softest Zephyr breathes where pitch ye camp  And thence
    farscattered sweetness fills the plain
 Censor of me leave blame and stint advice  Thou bringest wearying
    words and wisdom vain
 Why heat my passion with this flame and up  braid me when naught thou
    knowest of its bane
 Captured me eyes with passion maladifs  And overthrew me with Loves
    might and main
 I scatter tears the while I scatter verse  You are my theme for rhyme
    and prosy strain
 Melted my vitals glow of rosy cheeks  And in the Lazlowe my heart is
    lain
 Tell me an I leave to discourse of you  What speech my breast shall
    broaden Tell me deign
 Lifelong I loved the lovelings fair but ah  To grant my wish eke
    Allah must be fain

Hearing his verses the old woman was moved to ruth for him and Allah
planted the seed of affection for him in her heart so coming up to him
she consoled him saying Be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and
clear and put away trouble from thy thought for by Allah I will
venture my life with thee till thou attain thine aim or death undo me
With this Hasans heart was comforted and his bosom broadened and he
sat talking with the old woman till the end of the day when all the
girls dispersed some entering their townmansions and others nighting
in the tents Then the old woman carried him into the city and lodged
him in a place apart lest any should come to know of him and tell the
Queen of him and she should slay him and slay her who had brought him
thither Moreover she served him herself and strave to put him in fear
of the awful majesty of the Supreme King his wifes father whilst he
wept before her and said O my lady I choose death for myself and
loathe this worldly life if I foregather not with my wife and children
I have set my existence on the venture and will either attain my aim or
die So the old woman fell to pondering the means of bringing him and
his wife together and casting about how to do in the case of this
unhappy one who had thrown himself into destruction and would not be
diverted from his purpose by fear or aught else for indeed he recked
not of his life and the sayer of bywords saith Lover in nowise
hearkeneth he to the speech of the man who is fancyfree Now the name
of the Queen of the island wherein they were was Nr alHud
eldest daughter of the Supreme King and she had six virgin sisters
abiding with their father whose capital and court were in the chief
city of that region and who had made her ruler over all the lands and
islands of Wak So when the ancient dame saw Hasan on fire with yearning
after his wife and children she rose up and repaired to the palace and
going in to Queen Nur alHuda kissed ground before her for she had a
claim on her favour because she had reared the Kings daughters one and
all and had authority over each and every of them and was high in honour
and consideration with them and with the King Nur alHuda rose to her
as she entered and embracing her seated her by her side and asked her
of her journey She answered By Allah O my lady twas a blessed
journey and I have brought thee a gift which I will presently present to
thee adding O my daughter O Queen of the Age and the time I have a
favour to crave of thee and I fain would discover it to thee that thou
mayst help me to accomplish it and but for my confidence that thou wilt
not gainsay me therein I would not expose it to thee Asked the Queen
And what is thy need Expound it to me and I will accomplish it to
thee for I and my kingdom and troops are all at thy commandment and
disposition Therewithal the old woman quivered as quivereth the reed
on a day when the stormwind is abroad and saying in herself O
Protector protect me from the Queens mischief fell down before
her and acquainted her with Hasans case saying O my lady a man who
had hidden himself under my wooden settle on the seashore sought my
protection so I took him under my safeguard and carried him with me
among the army of girls armed and accoutred so that none might know him
and brought him into the city and indeed I have striven to affright him
with thy fierceness giving him to know of thy power and prowess but
as often as I threatened him he weepeth and reciteth verses and
sayethNeeds must I have my wife and children or die and I will not
return to my country without them And indeed he hath adventured himself
and come to the Islands of Wak and never in all my days saw I mortal
heartier of heart than he or doughtier of derringdo save that love
hath mastered him to the utmost of masteryAnd Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say


           Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Ninth Night

She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the old woman
related to Queen Nur alHuda the adventure of Hasan ending with Never
I saw any one heartier of heart than he save that love hath mastered him
to the utmost of mastery the Queen after lending an attentive ear and
comprehending the case waxed wroth at her with exceeding wrath and
bowed her head awhile groundwards then raising it she looked at
Shawahi and said to her O illomened beldam art thou come to such a
pass of lewdness that thou carriest males men with thee into the
Islands of Wak and bringest them into me unfearing of my mischief Who
hath foregone thee with this fashion that thou shouldst do thus By the
head of the King but for thy claim on me for fosterage and service I
would forthwith do both him and thee to die the foulest of deaths that
travellers might take warning by thee O accursed lest any other do the
like of this outrageous deed thou hast done which none durst hitherto
But go and bring him hither forthright that I may see him or I will
strike off thy head O accursed So the old woman went out from her
confounded unknowing whither she went and saying All this calamity
hath Allah driven upon me from this Queen because of Hasan and going
in to him said Rise speak with the Queen O wight whose last hour is
at hand So he rose and went with her whilst his tongue ceased not to
call upon Almighty Allah and say O my God be gracious to me in Thy
decrees and deliver me from this Thine affliction And Shawahi
went with him charging him by the way how he should speak with the
Queen When he stood before Nur alHuda he found that she had donned
the chinveil so he kissed ground before her and saluted her with
the salam improvising these two couplets

 God make thy glory last in joy of life  Allah confirm the boons he
    deigned bestow
 Thy grace and grandeur may our Lord increase  And aye Th Almighty aid
    thee oer thy foe

When he ended his verse Nur alHuda bade the old woman ask him questions
before her that she might hear his answers so she said to him The
Queen returneth thy salamgreeting and saith to thee What is thy name
and that of thy country and what are the names of thy wife and
children on whose account thou art come hither Quoth he and indeed
he had made firm his heart and destiny aided him O Queen of the age
and tide and peerless jewel of the epoch and the time my name is Hasan
the fulfilled of sorrow and my native city is Bassorah I know not the
name of my wife but my childrens names are Nsir and Mansr When
the Queen heard his reply and his provenance she bespoke him herself
and said And whence took she her children He replied O Queen she
took them from the city of Baghdad and the palace of the Caliphate
Quoth Nur alHuda And did she say naught to thee at the time she flew
away and quoth he Yes she said to my motherWhenas thy son cometh
to thee and the nights of severance upon him longsome shall be and he
craveth meeting and reunion to see and whenas the breezes of love and
longing shake him dolefully let him come in the Islands of Wak to me
Whereupon Queen Nur alHuda shook her head and said to him Had she not
desired thee she had not said to thy mother this say and had she not
yearned for reunion with thee never had she bidden thee to her stead
nor acquainted thee with her abidingplace Rejoined Hasan O mistress
of Kings and asylum of prince and pauper whatso happened I have told
thee and have concealed naught thereof and I take refuge from evil with
Allah and with thee wherefore oppress me not but have compassion on me
and earn recompense and requital for me in the world to come and aid me
to regain my wife and children Grant me my urgent need and cool mine
eyes with my children and help me to the sight of them Then he wept
and wailed and lamenting his lot recited these two couplets

 Yea I will laud thee while the ringdove moans  Though fail my wish
    of due and lawful scope
 Neer was I whirled in bliss and joys gone by  Wherein I found thee not
    both root and rope

The Queen shook her head and bowed it in thought a long time then
raising it she said to Hasan and indeed she was wroth I have ruth
on thee and am resolved to show thee in review all the girls in the city
and in the provinces of my island and in case thou know thy wife I
will deliver her to thee but an thou know her not and know not her
place I will put thee to death and crucify thee over the old womans
door Replied Hasan I accept this from thee O Queen of the Age and
am content to submit to this thy condition There is no Majesty and
there is no Might save in Allah the Glorious the Great And he
recited these couplets

 Youve roused my desire and remain at rest  Waked my wounded lids
    while you slept with zest
 And ye made me a vow ye would not hang back  But your guile when you
    chained me waxt manifest
 I loved you in childhood unknowing Love  Then slay me not who am sore
    opprest
 Fear ye not from Allah when slaying a friend  Who gazeth on stars when
    folk sleep their best
 By Allah my kinsmen indite on my tomb  This man was the slave of
    Loves harshest hest
 Haps a noble youth like me Loves own thrall  When he sees my grave
    on my name shall call

Then Queen Nur alHuda commanded that not a girl should abide in the
city but should come up to the palace and pass in review before Hasan
and moreover she bade Shawahi go down in person and bring them up
herself Accordingly all the maidens in the city presented themselves
before the Queen who caused them to go in to Hasan hundred after
hundred till there was no girl left in the place but she had shown her
to him yet he saw not his wife amongst them Then said she to him
Seest thou her amongst these and he replied By thy life O Queen
she is not amongst them With this she was sore enraged against him and
said to the old woman Go in and bring out all who are in the palace
and show them to him So she displayed to him every one of the
palacegirls but he saw not his wife among them and said to the Queen
By the life of thy head O Queen she is not among these Whereat the
Queen was wroth and cried out at those around her saying Take him and
hale him along face to earth and cut off his head least any adventure
himself after him and intrude upon us in our country and spy out our
estate by thus treading the soil of our islands So they threw him down
on his face and dragged him along then covering his eyes with his
skirt stood at his head with bared brands awaiting royal permission
Thereupon Shawahi came forward and kissing the ground before the Queen
took the hem of her garment and laid it on her head saying O Queen
by my claim for fosterage be not hasty with him more by token of thy
knowledge that this poor wretch is a stranger who hath adventured
himself and suffered what none ever suffered before him and Allah to
whom belong Might and Majesty preserved him from death for that his
life was ordained to be long He heard of thine equity and entered thy
city and guarded site wherefore if thou put him to death the
report will dispread abroad of thee by means of the travellers that
thou hatest strangers and slayest them He is in any case at thy mercy
and the slain of thy sword if his wife be not found in thy dominions
and whensoever thou desireth his presence I can bring him back to thee
Moreover in very sooth I took him under my protection only of my trust
in thy magnanimity through my claim on thee for fosterage so that I
engaged to him that thou wouldst bring him to his desire for my
knowledge of thy justice and quality of mercy But for this I had not
brought him into thy kingdom for I said to myselfThe Queen will take
pleasure in looking upon him and hearing him speak his verses and his
sweet discourse and eloquent which is like unto pearls strung on string
Moreover he hath entered our land and eaten of our meat wherefore he
hath a claim upon usAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased to say her permitted say


           Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Tenth Night

She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Queen
Nur alHuda bade her pages seize Hasan and smite his neck the old
woman Shawahi began to reason with her and say Verily he hath
entered our land and eaten of our meat wherefore he hath a claim upon
us the more especially since I promised him to bring him in company
with thee and thou knowest that parting is a grievous ill and
severance hath power to kill especially separation from children Now
he hath seen all our women save only thyself so do thou show him thy
face The Queen smiled and said How can he be my husband and have had
children by me that I should show him my face Then she made them
bring Hasan before her and when he stood in the presence she unveiled
her face which when he saw he cried out with a great cry and fell down
fainting The old woman ceased not to tend him till he came to himself
and as soon as he revived he recited these couplets

 O breeze that blowest from the land Irak  And from their corners whoso
    cry Wak Wak
 Bear news of me to friends and say for me  Ive tasted passionfood of
    bitter smack
 O dearlings of my love show grace and ruth  My heart is melted for
    this severancerack

When he ended his verse he rose and looking on the Queens face cried
out with a great cry for stress whereof the palace was like to fall
upon all therein Then he swooned away again and the old woman ceased
not to tend him till he revived when she asked him what ailed him and
he answered In very sooth this Queen is either my wife or else the
likest of all folk to my wifeAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day
and ceased saying her permitted say


         Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Eleventh Night

She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the old
woman asked Hasan what ailed him he answered In very sooth this Queen
is either my wife or else the likest of all folk to my wife Quoth Nur
alHuda to the old woman Woe to thee O nurse This stranger is either
Jinnmad or out of his mind for he stareth me in the face with wide
eyes and saith I am his wife Quoth the old woman O Queen indeed he
is excusable so blame him not for the saying saithFor the lovesick
is no remedy and alike are the madman and he And Hasan wept with sore
weeping and recited these two couplets

 I sight their track and pine for longing love  And oer their
    homesteads weep I and I yearn
 And I pray Heaven who willd we should part  Will deign to grant us
    boon of safe return

Then said Hasan to the Queen once more By Allah thou art not my wife
but thou art the likest of all folk to her Hereupon Nur alHuda
laughed till she fell backwards and rolled round on her side Then
she said to him O my friend take thy time and observe me attentively
answer me at thy leisure what I shall ask thee and put away from thee
insanity and perplexity and inadvertency for relief is at hand
Answered Hasan O mistress of Kings and asylum of all princes and
paupers when I looked upon thee I was distracted seeing thee to be
either my wife or the likest of all folk to her but now ask me whatso
thou wilt Quoth she What is it in thy wife that resembleth me and
quoth he O my lady all that is in thee of beauty and loveliness
elegance and amorous grace such as the symmetry of thy shape and the
sweetness of thy speech and the blushing of thy cheeks and the jutting
of thy breasts and so forth all resembleth her and thou art her very
self in thy faculty of parlance and the fairness of thy favour and the
brilliancy of thy brow When the Queen heard this she smiled and
gloried in her beauty and loveliness and her cheeks reddened and her
eyes wantoned then she turned to Shawahi Umm Dawahi and said to her O
my mother carry him back to the place where he tarried with thee and
tend him thyself till I examine into his affair for an he be indeed a
man of manliness and mindful of friendship and love and affection it
behoveth we help him to win his wish more by token that he hath
sojourned in our country and eaten of our victual not to speak of the
hardships of travel he hath suffered and the travail and horrors he hath
undergone But when thou hast brought him to thy house commend him to
the care of thy dependents and return to me in all haste and Allah
Almighty willing all shall be well Thereupon Shawahi carried him
back to her lodging and charged her handmaids and servants and suite
wait upon him and bring him all he needed nor fail in what was his due
Then she returned to Queen Nur alHuda who bade her don her arms and
set out taking with her a thousand doughty horsemen So she obeyed and
donned her wargear and having collected the thousand riders reported
them ready to the Queen who bade her march upon the city of the Supreme
King her father there to alight at the abode of her youngest sister
Manr alSan and say to her Clothe thy two sons in the coats of
mail which their aunt hath made them and send them to her for she
longeth for them Moreover the Queen charged her keep Hasans affair
secret and say to Manar alSana after securing her children Thy
sister inviteth thee to visit her Then she continued bring the
children to me in haste and let her follow at her leisure Do thou come
by a road other than her road and journey night and day and beware of
discovering this matter to any And I swear by all manner of oaths that
if my sister prove to be his wife and it appear that her children are
his I will not hinder him from taking her and them and departing with
them to his own countryAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased to say her permitted say


          Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Twelfth Night

She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Queen
said I swear by Allah and by all manner of oaths that if she prove to
be his wife I will not hinder him from taking her but will aid him
thereto and eke to departing with them to his motherland And the old
woman put faith in her words knowing not what she purposed in her mind
for the wicked Jezebel had resolved that if she were not his wife she
would slay him but if the children resembled him she would believe
him The Queen resumed O my mother an my thought tell me true my
sister Manar alSana is his wife but Allah alone is Allknowing seeing
that these traits of surpassing beauty and excelling grace of which he
spoke are found in none except my sisters and especially in the
youngest The old woman kissed her hand and returning to Hasan told
him what the Queen had said whereat he was like to fly for joy and
coming up to her kissed her head Quoth she O my son kiss not my
head but kiss me on the mouth and be this kiss by way of sweetmeat for
thy salvation Be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear
and grudge not to kiss my mouth for I and only I was the means of thy
foregathering with her So take comfort and hearten thy heart and
broaden thy breast and gladden thy glance and console thy soul for
Allah willing thy desire shall be accomplished at my hand So saying
she bade him farewell and departed whilst he recited these two
couplets

 Witnesses unto love of thee Ive four  And wants each case two
    witnesses no more
 A heart aye fluttering limbs that ever quake  A wasted frame and
    tongue that speech forswore

And also these two

 Two things there be an bloodtears thereover  Wept eyes till not one
    trace thou couldst discover
 Eyes neer could pay the tithe to them is due  The prime of youth and
    severance from lover

Then the old woman armed herself and taking with her a thousand
weaponed horsemen set out and journeyed till she came to the island and
the city where dwelt the Lady Manar alSana and between which and that
of her sister Queen Nur alHuda was three days journey When Shawahi
reached the city she went in to the Princess and saluting her gave her
her sisters salam and acquainted her with the Queens longing for her
and her children and that she reproached her for not visiting her Quoth
Manar alSana Verily I am beholden to my sister and have failed of my
duty to her in not visiting her but I will do so forthright Then she
bade pitch her tents without the city and took with her for her sister a
suitable present of rare things Presently the King her father looked
out of a window of his palace and seeing the tents pitched by the road
asked of them and they answered him The Princess Manar alSana hath
pitched her tents by the wayside being minded to visit her sister
Queen Nur alHuda When the King heard this he equipped troops to
escort her to her sister and brought out to her from his treasuries meat
and drink and monies and jewels and rarities which beggar description
Now the King had seven daughters all sistersgerman by one mother and
father except the youngest the eldest was called Nr alHud the
second Najm alSabh the third Shams alZuh the fourth Shajarat
alDurr the fifth Kt alKulb the sixth Sharaf alBant and the
youngest Manar alSana Hasans wife who was their sister by the
fathers side only Anon the old woman again presented herself and
kissed ground before the Princess who said to her Hast thou any need
O my mother Quoth Shawahi Thy sister Queen Nur alHuda biddeth
thee clothe thy sons in the two habergeons which she fashioned for them
and send them to her by me and I will take them and forego thee with
them and be the harbinger of glad tidings and the announcer of thy
coming to her When the Princess heard these words her colour changed
and she bowed her head a long while after which she shook it and
looking up said to the old woman O my mother my vitals tremble and
my heart fluttereth when thou namest my children for from the time of
their birth none hath looked on their faces either Jinn or man male or
female and I am jealous for them of the zephyr when it breatheth in the
night Exclaimed the old woman What words are these O my lady Dost
thou fear for them from thy sisterAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn
of day and ceased saying her permitted say


        Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Thirteenth Night

She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the old woman said
to the Princess Manar alSana What words be these O my lady Dost
thou fear for them from thy sister Allah safeguard thy reason Thou
mayst not cross the Queens majesty in this matter for she would be
wroth with thee However O my lady the children are young and thou
art excusable in fearing for them for those that love well are wont to
deem ill but O my daughter thou knowest my tenderness and mine
affection for thee and thy children for indeed I reared thee before
them I will take them in my charge and make my cheek their pillow and
open my heart and set them within nor is it needful to charge me with
care of them in the like of this case so be of cheerful heart and
tearless eye and send them to her for at the most I shall but precede
thee with them a day or at most two days And she ceased not to urge
her till she gave way fearing her sisters fury and unknowing what
lurked for her in the dark future and consented to send them with the
old woman So she called them and bathed them and equipped them and
changed their apparel Then she clad them in the two little coats of
mail and delivered them to Shawahi who took them and sped on with them
like a bird by another road than that by which their mother should
travel even as the Queen had charged her nor did she cease to fare on
with all diligence being fearful for them till she came in sight of
Nur alHudas city when she crossed the river and entering the town
carried them in to their aunt The Queen rejoiced at their sight and
embraced them and pressed them to her breast after which she seated
them one upon the right thigh and the other upon the left and turning
round said to the old woman Fetch me Hasan forthright for I have
granted him my safeguard and have spared him from my sabre and he hath
sought asylum in my house and taken up his abode in my courts after
having endured hardships and horrors and passed through all manner
mortal risks each terribler than other yet hitherto is he not safe
from drinking the cup of death and from cutting off his breathAnd
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say


        Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Fourteenth Night

She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Queen
Nur alHuda bade the old woman bring Hasan she said Verily he hath
endured hardships and horrors and passed through all manner mortal risks
each terribler than other yet hitherto he is not safe from death and
from the cutting off of his breath Replied Shawahi An I bring him to
thee wilt thou reunite him with these his children Or if they prove
not his wilt thou pardon him and restore him to his own country
Hearing these her words the Queen waxed exceeding wroth and cried to
her Fie upon thee O illomened old woman How long wilt thou false us
in the matter of this strange man who hath dared to intrude himself upon
us and hath lifted our veil and pried into our conditions Say me
thinkest thou that he shall come to our land and look upon our faces and
betray our honour and after return in safety to his own country and
expose our affairs to his people wherefore our report will be bruited
abroad among all the Kings of the quarters of the earth and the
merchants will journey bearing tidings of us in all directions
sayingA mortal entered the Isles of Wak and traversed the Land of the
Jinn and the Lands of the Wild Beasts and the Islands of Birds and set
foot in the country of the Warlocks and the Enchanters and returned in
safety This shall never be no never and I swear by Him who made the
Heavens and builded them yea by Him who dispread the earth and
smoothed it and who created all creatures and counted them that an
they be not his children I will assuredly slay him and strike his neck
with mine own hand Then she cried out at the old woman who fell down
for fear and set upon her the Chamberlain and twenty Mamelukes saying
Go with this crone and fetch me in haste the youth who is in her
house So they dragged Shawaki along yellow with fright and with
sidemuscles quivering till they came to her house where she went in
to Hasan who rose to her and kissed her hands and saluted her She
returned not his salam but said to him Come speak the Queen Did I
not say to theeReturn presently to thine own country and I will give
thee that to which no mortal may avail And did I forbid thee from all
this But thou wouldst not obey me nor listen to my words nay thou
rejectedst my counsel and chosest to bring destruction on me and on
thyself Up then and take that which thou hast chosen for death is
near hand Arise speak with yonder vile harlot and tyrant that she
is So Hasan arose brokenspirited heavyhearted and full of fear
and crying O Preserver preserve Thou me O my God be gracious to me
in that which Thou hast decreed to me of Thine affliction and protect
me O Thou the most Merciful of the Mercifuls Then despairing of his
life he followed the twenty Mamelukes the Chamberlain and the crone to
the Queens presence where he found his two sons Nasir and Mansur
sitting in her lap whilst she played and made merry with them As soon
as his eyes fell on them he knew them and crying a great cry fell down
afainting for excess of joy at the sight of his childrenAnd
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say


         Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Fifteenth Night

She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Hasans eyes
fell upon his two sons he knew them both and crying a great cry fell
down afainting They also knew him and natural affection moved
them so that they freed themselves from the Queens lap and fell upon
Hasan and Allah to whom belong Might and Majesty made them speak and
say to him O our father Whereupon the old woman and all who were
present wept for pity and tenderness over them and said Praised be
Allah who hath reunited you with your Sire Presently Hasan came to
himself and embracing his children wept till again he swooned away and
when he revived he recited these verses

 By rights of you this heart of mine could neer aby  Severance from
    you albeit Union death imply
 Your phantom saith to me Amorrow we shall meet  Shall I despite
    the foe the morrowday espy
 By rights of you I swear my lords that since the day  Of severance
    neer the sweets of lips enjoyd I
 An Allah bade me perish for the love of you  Mid greatest martyrs for
    your love I lief will die
 Oft a gazelle doth make my heart her browsing stead  The while her form
    of flesh like sleep eludes mine eye
 If in the lists of Law my bloodshed she deny  Prove it two witnesses
    those cheeks of ruddy dye

When Nur alHuda was assured that the little ones were indeed Hasans
children and that her sister the Princess Manar alSana was his wife
of whom he was come in quest she was wroth against her with wrath
beyond measureAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to
say her permitted say


         Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Sixteenth Night

She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Nur
alHuda was certified that the little ones were Hasans children and
that her sister Manar alSana was his wife of whom he had come in quest
she raged with exceeding rage too great to be assuaged and screamed in
Hasans face and reviled him and kicked him in the breast so that he
fell on his back in a swoon Then she cried out at him saying Arise
fly for thy life But that I swore that no evil should betide thee from
me should thy tale prove true I would slay thee with mine own hand
forthright And she cried out at the old woman who fell on her face
for fear and said to her By Allah but that I am loath to break the
oath that I swore I would put both thee and him to death after the
foulest fashion presently adding Arise go out from before me in
safety and return to thine own country for I swear by my fortune if
ever mine eye espy thee or if any bring thee in to me after this I will
smite off thy head and that of whoso bringeth thee Then she cried out
to her officers saying Put him out from before me So they thrust
him out and when he came to himself he recited these couplets

 Youre far yet to my heart youre nearest near  Absent yet present in
    my sprite you appear
 By Allah neer to other Ive inclined  But tyranny of Time in patience
    bear
 Nights pass while still I love you and they end  And burns my breast
    with flames of fell Sar
 I was a youth who parting for an hour  Bore not then what of months
    that make a year
 Jealous am I of breezebreath fanning thee  Yea jealousmad of fair
    softsided fere

Then he once more fell down in a swoon and when he came to himself he
found himself without the palace whither they had dragged him on his
face so he rose stumbling over his skirts and hardly crediting his
escape from Nur alHuda Now this was grievous to Shawahi but she dared
not remonstrate with the Queen by reason of the violence of her wrath
And forthright Hasan went forth distracted and knowing not whence to
come or whither to go the world for all its wideness was straitened
upon him and he found none to speak a kind word with him and comfort
him nor any to whom he might resort for counsel or to apply for refuge
wherefore he made sure of death for that he could not journey to his own
country and knew none to travel with him neither wist he the way
thither nor might he pass through the Wady of the Jann and the Land of
Beasts and the Islands of Birds So giving himself up for lost he bewept
himself till he fainted and when he revived he bethought him of his
children and his wife and of that might befal her with her sister
repenting him of having come to those countries and of having hearkened
to none and recited these couplets

 Suffer mine eyebabes weep lost of love and tears express  Rare is my
    solace and increases my distress
 The cup of Severancechances to the dregs Ive drained  Who is the man
    to bear loveloss with manliness
 Ye spread the Carpet of Disgrace betwixt us twain  Ah when shalt
    be uprolled O Carpet of Disgrace
 I watched the while you slept and if you deemed that I  Forgot your
    love I but forget forgetfulness
 Woes me indeed my heart is pining for the love  Of you the only
    leaches who can cure my case
 See ye not what befel me from your fell disdain  Debased am I before
    the low and high no less
 I hid my love of you but longing laid it bare  And burns my heart wi
    fire of passions sorest stress
 Ah deign have pity on my piteous case for I  Have kept our troth in
    secresy and patent place
 Would Heaven I wot shall Time eer deign us twain rejoin  You are my
    hearts desire my sprites sole happiness
 My vitals bear the Severancewound would Heaven that you  With tidings
    from your camp would deign my soul to bless

Then he went on till he came without the city where he found the
river and walked along its bank knowing not whither he went Such was
Hasans case but as regards his wife Manar alSana as she was about to
carry out her purpose and to set out on the second day after the
departure of the old woman with her children behold there came in to
her one of the chamberlains of the King her sire and kissed ground
between his handsAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased
saying her permitted say


        Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Seventeenth Night

She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Manar
alSana was about to set out upon the journey behold a chamberlain of
the King her sire came in to her and kissing the ground before her
said O Princess the Supreme King thy father saluteth thee and
biddeth thee to him So she rose and accompanied the chamberlain to
learn what was required by her father who seated her by his side on the
couch and said to her O my daughter know that I have this night had
a dream which maketh me fear for thee and that long sorrow will betide
thee from this thy journey Quoth she How so O my father and what
didst thou see in thy dream and quoth he I dreamt that I entered a
hidden hoard wherein was great store of monies of jewels of jacinths
and of other riches but twas as if naught pleased me of all this
treasure and jewelry save seven bezels which were the finest things
there I chose out one of the seven jewels for it was the smallest
finest and most lustrous of them and its water pleased me so I took it
in my handpalm and fared forth of the treasury When I came without the
door I opened my hand rejoicing and turned over the jewel when
behold there swooped down on me out of the welkin a strange bird from a
far land for it was not of the birds of our country and snatching it
from my hand returned with it whence it came Whereupon sorrow and
concern and sore vexation overcame me and my exceeding chagrin so
troubled me that I awoke mourning and lamenting for the loss of the
jewel At once on awaking I summoned the interpreters and expounders of
dreams and declared to them my dream and they said to meThou
hast seven daughters the youngest of whom thou wilt lose and she will
be taken from thee perforce without thy will Now thou O my girl art
the youngest and dearest of my daughters and the most affectionate of
them to me and lookye thou art about to journey to thy sister and I
know not what may befal thee from her so go thou not but return to thy
palace But when the Princess heard her fathers words her heart
fluttered and she feared for her children and bent earthwards her head
awhile then she raised it and said to her sire O King Queen Nur
alHuda hath made ready for me an entertainment and awaiteth my coming
to her hour by hour These four years she hath not seen me and if I
delay to visit her she will be wroth with me The utmost of my stay
with her shall be a month and then I will return to thee Besides who
is the mortal who can travel our land and make his way to the Islands of
Wak Who can gain access to the White Country and the Black Mountain and
come to the Land of Camphor and the Castle of Crystal and how shall he
traverse the Island of Birds and the Wady of Wild Beasts and the Valley
of the Jann and enter our Islands If any stranger came hither he would
be drowned in the seas of destruction so be of good cheer and eyes
without a tear anent my journey for none may avail to tread our earth
And she ceased not to persuade him till he deigned give her leave to
departAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her
permitted say


        Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Eighteenth Night

She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Princess
ceased not to persuade him till he deigned give her leave to depart and
bade a thousand horse escort her to the river and abide there till she
entered her sisters city and palace and returned to them when they
should take her and carry her back to him Moreover he charged her
tarry with her sister but two days and return to him in haste and she
answered Hearing and obedience Then rising up she went forth and he
with her and farewelled her Now his words had sunken deep into her
heart and she feared for her children but it availeth not to fortify
herself by any device against the onset of Destiny So she set out and
fared on diligently three days till she came to the river and pitched
her tents on its bank Then she crossed the stream with some of her
counsellors pages and suite and going up to the city and the palace
went in to Queen Nur alHuda with whom she found her children who ran
to her weeping and crying out O our father At this the tears railed
from her eyes and she wept then she strained them to her bosom saying
What Have you seen your sire at this time Would the hour had never
been in which I left him If I knew him to be in the house of the
world I would carry you to him Then she bemoaned herself and her
husband and her children weeping and reciting these couplets

 My friends despite this distance and this cruelty  I pine for you
    incline to you whereer you be
 My glance for ever turns towards your hearth and home  And mourns my
    heart the bygone days you woned with me
 How many a night foregathered we withouten fear  One loving other
    faithful ever fain and free

When her sister saw her fold her children to her bosom saying Tis I
who have done thus with myself and my children and have ruined my own
house she saluted her not but said to her O whore whence haddest
thou these children Say hast thou married unbeknown to thy sire or
hast thou committed fornication An thou have played the piece it
behoveth thou be exemplarily punished and if thou have married sans our
knowledge why didst thou abandon thy husband and separate thy sons from
thy sire and bring them hitherAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of
day and ceased saying her permitted say


        Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Nineteenth Night

She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that quoth Nur
alHuda the Queen to her sister Manar alSana the Princess An thou
have married sans our knowledge why didst thou abandon thy husband and
separate thy sons from their sire and bring them to our land Thou hast
hidden thy children from us Thinkest thou we know not of this Allah
Almighty He who is cognisant of the concealed hath made known to us
thy case and revealed thy condition and bared thy nakedness Then she
bade her guards seize her and pinion her elbows and shackle her with
shackles of iron So they did as she commanded and she beat her with a
grievous beating so that her skin was torn and hanged her up by the
hair after which she cast her in prison and wrote the King her father a
writ acquainting him with her case and saying There hath appeared in
our land a man a mortal by name Hasan and our sister Manar alSana
avoucheth that she is lawfully married to him and bare him two sons
whom she hath hidden from us and thee nor did she discover aught of
herself till there came to us this man and informed us that he wedded
her and she tarried with him a long while after which she took her
children and departed without his knowledge bidding as she went his
mother tell her son whenas longing began to rack to come to her in the
Islands of Wak So we laid hands on the man and sent the old woman
Shawahi to fetch her and her offspring enjoining her to bring us the
children in advance of her And she did so whilst Manar alSana
equipped herself and set out to visit me When the boys were brought to
me and ere the mother came I sent for Hasan the mortal who claimeth her
to wife and he on entering and at first sight knew them and they knew
him whereby was I certified that the children were indeed his children
and that she was his wife and I learned that the mans story was true
and he was not to blame but that the reproach and the infamy rested
with my sister Now I feared the rending of our honourveil before the
folk of our Isles so when this wanton this traitress came in to me
I was incensed against her and cast her into prison and bastinadod her
grievously and hanged her up by the hair Behold I have acquainted thee
with her case and it is thine to command and whatso thou orderest us
that we will do Thou knowest that in this affair is dishonour and
disgrace to our name and to thine and haply the islanders will hear of
it and we shall become amongst them a byword wherefore it besitteth
thou return us an answer with all speed Then she delivered the letter
to a courier and he carried it to the King who when he read it was
wroth with exceeding wrath with his daughter Manar alSana and wrote to
Nur alHuda saying I commit her case to thee and give thee command
over her life so if the matter be as thou sayest kill her without
consulting me When the Queen had received and read her fathers
letter she sent for Manar alSana and they set before her the prisoner
drowned in her blood and pinioned with her hair shackled with heavy
iron shackles and clad in haircloth and they made her stand in the
presence abject and abashed When she saw herself in this condition of
passing humiliation and exceeding abjection she called to mind her
former high estate and wept with sore weeping and recited these two
couplets

 O Lord my foes are fain to slay me in despight  Nor deem I anywise to
    find escape by flight
 I have recourse to Thee t annul what they have done  Thou art th
    asylum Lord of fearful suppliant wight

Then wept she grievously till she fell down in a swoon and presently
coming to herself repeated these two couplets

 Troubles familiar with my heart are grown and I with them  erst
    shunning for the generous are sociable still
 Not one mere kind alone of woe doth lieger with me lie  Praised be
    God There are with me thousands of kinds of ill

And also these

 Oft times Mischance shall straiten noble breast  With grief whence
    issue is for Him to shape
 But when the meshes straitest tightest seem  They loose though
    deemed I neer to find escape

And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her
permitted say


         Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Twentieth Night

She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Queen Nur
alHuda ordered into the presence her sister Princess Manar alSana
they set her between her hands and she pinioned as she was recited the
verses aforesaid Then the Queen sent for a ladder of wood and made
the eunuchs lay her on her back with her arms spread out and bind her
with cords thereto after which she bared her head and wound her hair
about the ladderrungs and indeed all pity for her was rooted out from
her heart When Manar alSana saw herself in this state of abjection and
humiliation she cried out and wept but none succoured her Then said
she to the Queen O my sister how is thy heart hardened against me
Has thou no mercy on me nor pity on these little children But her
words only hardened her sisters heart and she insulted her saying O
Wanton O harlot Allah have no ruth on whoso sueth for thee How should
I have compassion on thee O traitress Replied Manar alSana who lay
stretched on the ladder I appeal from thee to the Lord of the Heavens
concerning that wherewith thou revilest me and whereof I am innocent By
Allah I have done no whoredom but am lawfully married to him and my
Lord knoweth an I speak sooth or not Indeed my heart is wroth with
thee by reason of thine excessive hardheartedness against me How canst
thou cast at me the charge of harlotry without knowledge But my Lord
will deliver me from thee and if that whoredom whereof thou accusest me
be true may He presently punish me for it Quoth Nur alHuda after a
few moments of reflection How durst thou bespeak me thus and rose and
beat her till she fainted away whereupon they sprinkled water on
her face till she revived and in truth her charms were wasted for
excess of beating and the straitness of her bonds and the sore insults
she had suffered Then she recited these two couplets

 If aught Ive sinned in sinful way  Or done ill deed and gone astray
 The past repent I and I come  To you and for your pardon pray

When Nur alHuda heard these lines her wrath redoubled and she said to
her Wilt speak before me in verse O whore and seek to excuse thyself
for the mortal sins thou hast sinned Twas my desire that thou shouldst
return to thy husband that I might witness thy wickedness and matchless
brazenfacedness for thou gloriest in thy lewdness and wantonness and
mortal heinousness Then she called for a palmstick and whenas they
brought the Jard she arose and baring arms to elbows beat her sister
from head to foot after which she called for a whip of plaited thongs
wherewith if one smote an elephant he would start off at full speed
and came down therewith on her back and her stomach and every part of
her body till she fainted When the old woman Shawahi saw this she
fled forth from the Queens presence weeping and cursing her but Nur
alHuda cried out to her eunuchs saying Fetch her to me So they ran
after her and seizing her brought her back to the Queen who bade throw
her on the ground and making them lay hold of her rose and took the
whip with which she beat her till she swooned away when she said to
her waitingwomen Drag this illomened beldam forth on her face and
put her out And they did as she bade them So far concerning them but
as regards Hasan he walked on beside the river in the direction of the
desert distracted troubled and despairing of life and indeed he was
dazed and knew not night from day for stress of affliction He ceased
not faring on thus till he came to a tree whereto he saw a scroll
hanging so he took it and found written thereon these couplets

 When in thy mothers womb thou wast  I cast thy case the bestest best
 And turned her heart to thee so she  Fosterd thee on fondest breast
 We will suffice thee in whateer  Shall cause thee trouble or unrest
 Well aid thee in thine enterprise  So rise and bow to our behest

When he had ended reading this scroll he made sure of deliverance from
trouble and of winning reunion with those he loved Then he walked
forward a few steps and found himself alone in a wild and perilous wold
wherein there was none to company with him upon which his heart sank
within him for horror and loneliness and his sidemuscles trembled for
that fearsome place and he recited these couplets

 O Zephyr of Morn an thou pass where the dear ones dwell  Bear
    greeting of lover who ever in lovelonging wones
 And tell them Im pledged to yearning and pawned to pine  And the might
    of my passion all passion of lovers unthrones
 Their sympathies haply shall breathe in a Breeze like thee  And quicken
    forthright this framework of rotting bones

And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her
permitted say


       Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Twentyfirst Night

She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Hasan read
the scroll he was certified of deliverance from his trouble and made
sure of winning reunion with those he loved Then he walked forward a
couple of steps and stopped finding himself alone in a wild and perilous
wold wherein was none to company with him so he wept sore and recited
the verses before mentioned Then he walked on a few steps farther
beside the river till he came upon two little boys of the sons of the
sorcerers before whom lay a rod of copper graven with talismans and
beside it a skullcap of leather made of three gores and wroughten
in steel with names and characts The cap and rod were upon the ground
and the boys were disputing and beating each other till the blood ran
down between them whilst each cried None shall take the wand but I
So Hasan interposed and parted them saying What is the cause of your
contention and they replied O uncle be thou judge of our case for
Allah the Most High hath surely sent thee to do justice between us
Quoth Hasan Tell me your case and I will judge between you and
quoth one of them We twain are brothersgerman and our sire was a
mighty magician who dwelt in a cave on yonder mountain He died and
left us this cap and rod and my brother saithNone shall have the rod
but I whilst I say the like so be thou judge between us and deliver us
each from other Hasan asked What is the difference between the rod
and the cap and what is their value The rod appears to be worth six
coppers and the cap three whereto they answered Thou knowest
not their properties And what are their properties Each of them
hath a wonderful secret virtue wherefore the rod is worth the revenue
of all the Islands of Wak and their provinces and dependencies and the
cap the like By Allah O my sons discover to me their secret
virtues So they said O uncle they are extraordinary for our father
wrought an hundred and thirty and five years at their contrivance till
he brought them to perfection and ingrafted them with secret attributes
which might serve him extraordinary services and engraved them after the
likeness of the revolving sphere and by their aid he dissolved all
spells and when he had made an end of their fashion Death which all
needs must suffer overtook him Now the hidden virtue of the cap is
that whoso setteth it on his head is concealed from all folks eyes nor
can any see him whilst it remaineth on his head and that of the rod is
that whoso owneth it hath authority over seven tribes of the Jinn who
all serve the order and ordinance of the rod and whenever he who
possesseth it smiteth therewith on the ground their Kings come to do
him homage and all the Jinn are at his service Now when Hasan heard
these words he bowed his head groundwards awhile then said in himself
By Allah I shall conquer every foe by means of this rod and cap
Inshallah and I am worthier of them both than these two boys So I will
go about forthright to get them from the twain by craft that I may use
them to free myself and my wife and children from yonder tyrannical
Queen and then we will depart from this dismal stead whence there is
no deliverance for mortal man nor flight Doubtless Allah caused me not
to fall in with these two lads but that I might get the rod and cap
from them Then he raised his head and said to the two boys If ye
would have me decide the case I will make trial of you and see what
each of you deserveth He who overcometh his brother shall have the rod
and he who faileth shall have the cap They replied O uncle we
depute thee to make trial of us and do thou decide between us as thou
deems fit Hasan asked Will ye hearken to me and have regard to my
words and they answered Yes Then said he I will take a stone
and throw it and he who outrunneth his brother thereto and picketh it
up shall take the rod and the other who is outraced shall take the
cap And they said We accept and consent to this thy proposal Then
Hasan took a stone and threw it with his might so that it disappeared
from sight The two boys ran under and after it and when they were at a
distance he donned the cap and hending the rod in hand removed from
his place that he might prove the truth of that which the boys had said
with regard to their scant properties The younger outran the elder and
coming first to the stone took it and returned with it to the place
where they had left Hasan but found no signs of him So he called to
his brother saying Where is the man who was to be umpire between us
Quoth the other I espy him not neither wot I whether he hath flown up
to heaven above or sunk into earth beneath Then they sought for him
but saw him not though all the while he was standing in his stead hard
by them So they abused each other saying Rod and Cap are both gone
they are neither mine nor thine and indeed our father warned us of this
very thing but we forgot whatso he said Then they retraced their
steps and Hasan also entered the city wearing the cap and bearing the
rod and none saw him Now when he was thus certified of the truth of
their speech he rejoiced with exceeding joy and making the palace went
up into the lodging of Shawahi who saw him not because of the cap
Then he walked up to a shelf over her head upon which were vessels
of glass and chinaware and shook it with his hand so that what was
thereon fell to the ground The old woman cried out and beat her face
then she rose and restored the fallen things to their places
saying in herself By Allah methinks Queen Nur alHuda hath sent a
Satan to torment me and he hath tricked me this trick I beg Allah
Almighty deliver me from her and preserve me from her wrath for O
Lord if she deal thus abominably with her halfsister beating and
hanging her dear as she is to her sire how will she do with a stranger
like myself against whom she is incensedAnd Shahrazad perceived the
dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say


       Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Twentysecond Night

She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the ancient Lady
of Calamities cried When Queen Nur alHuda doeth such misdeed to her
sister what will she do to a stranger like myself against whom she is
incensed Then said she I conjure thee O devil by the Most
Compassionate the Bountifulgreat the High of Estate of Dominion
Elate who man and Jinn did create and by the writing upon the seal of
Solomon Davidson on both be the Peace speak to me and answer me
Quoth Hasan I am no devil I am Hasan the afflicted the distraught
Then he raised the cap from his head and appeared to the old woman who
knew him and taking him apart said to him What is come to thy reason
that thou returnest hither Go hide thee for if this wicked woman have
tormented thy wife with such torments and she her sister what will she
do an she light on thee Then she told him all that had befallen his
spouse and that wherein she was of travail and torment and tribulation
and straitly described all the pains she endured adding And indeed the
Queen repenteth her of having let thee go and hath sent one after thee
promising him an hundredweight of gold and my rank in her service and
she hath sworn that if he bring thee back she will do thee and thy
wife and children dead And she shed tears and discovered to Hasan what
the Queen had done with herself whereat he wept and said O my lady
how shall I do to escape from this land and deliver myself and my wife
and children from this tyrannical Queen and how devise to return with
them in safety to my own country Replied the old woman Woe to thee
Save thyself Quoth he There is no help but I deliver her and my
children from the Queen perforce and in her despite and quoth Shawahi
How canst thou forcibly rescue them from her Go and hide thyself O my
son till Allah Almighty empower thee Then Hasan showed her the rod
and the cap whereat she rejoiced with joy exceeding and cried Glory
be to Him who quickeneth the bones though they be rotten By Allah O
my son thou and thy wife were but of lost folk now however thou art
saved thou and thy wife and children For I know the rod and I know its
maker who was my Shaykh in the science of Gramarye He was a mighty
magician and spent an hundred and thirty and five years working at this
rod and cap till he brought them to perfection when Death the
Inevitable overtook him And I have heard him say to his two boysO my
sons these two things are not of your lot for there will come a
stranger from a far country who will take them from you by force and
ye shall not know how he taketh them Said theyO our father tell us
how he will avail to take them But he answeredI wot not And O my
son added she how availedst thou to take them So he told her how
he had taken them from the two boys whereat she rejoiced and said O
my son since thou hast gotten the whereby to free thy wife and
children give ear to what I shall say to thee For me there is no
woning with this wicked woman after the foul fashion in which she durst
use me so I am minded to depart from her to the caves of the Magicians
and there abide with them until I die But do thou O my son don the
cap and bend the rod in hand and enter the place where thy wife and
children are Unbind her bonds and smite the earth with the rod
sayingBe ye present O servants of these names whereupon the servants
of the rod will appear and if there present himself one of the Chiefs
of the Tribes command him whatso thou shalt wish and will So he
farewelled her and went forth donning the cap and hending the rod and
entered the place where his wife was He found her wellnigh lifeless
bound to the ladder by her hair tearfuleyed and woefulhearted in the
sorriest of plights knowing no way to deliver herself Her children
were playing under the ladder whilst she looked at them and wept for
them and herself because of the barbarities and sore treatings and
bitter penalties which had befallen her and he heard her repeat these
couplets

 There remaineth not aught save a fluttering breath and an eye whose
    owner is confounded
 And a desirous lover whose bowels are burned with fire notwithstanding
    which she is silent
 The exulting foe pitieth her at the sight of her Alas for her whom the
    exulting foe pitieth

When Hasan saw her in this state of torment and misery and ignominy and
infamy he wept till he fainted and when he recovered he saw his
children playing and their mother aswoon for excess of pain so he took
the cap from his head and the children saw him and cried out O our
father Then he covered his head again and the Princess came to
herself hearing their cry but saw only her children weeping and
shrieking O our father When she heard them name their sire and weep
her heart was broken and her vitals rent asunder and she said to them
What maketh you in mind of your father at this time And she wept sore
and cried out from a bursten liver and an aching bosom Where are ye
and where is your father Then she recalled the days of her union with
Hasan and what had befallen her since her desertion of him and wept with
sore weeping till her cheeks were seared and furrowed and her face was
drowned in a briny flood Her tears ran down and wetted the ground and
she had not a hand loose to wipe them from her cheeks whilst the flies
fed their fill on her skin and she found no helper but weeping and no
solace but improvising verses Then she repeated these couplets

 I call to mind the partingday that rent our loves in twain When as I
    turned away the tears in very streams did rain
 The cameleer urged on his beasts with them what while I found Nor
    strength nor fortitude nor did my heart with me remain
 Yea back I turned unknowing of the road nor might shake off The trance
    of grief and longing love that numbed my heart and brain
 And worst of all betided me on my return was one Who came to me in
    lowly guise to glory in my pain
 Since the belovds gone O soul forswear the sweet of life Nor covet
    its continuance for wanting him twere vain
 List O my friend unto the tale of love and God forbid That I should
    speak and that thy heart to hearken should not deign
 As twere El Asma himself of passion I discourse Fancies rare and
    marvellous linked in an endless chain

And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her
permitted say


       Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Twentythird Night

She continued When Hasan went in to his wife he saw his children and
heard her repeating the verses afore mentioned Then she turned
right and left seeking the cause of her childrens crying out O our
father but saw no one and marvelled that her sons should name their
sire at that time and call upon him But when Hasan heard her verses he
wept till he swooned away and the tears railed down his cheeks like
rain Then he drew near the children and raised the cap from his head
unseen of his wife whereupon they saw him and they knew him and cried
out saying O our father Their mother fell aweeping again when she
heard them name their sires name and said There is no avoiding the
doom which Almighty Allah hath decreed adding O Strange What
garreth them think of their father at this time and call upon him
albeit it is not of their wont Then she wept and recited these
couplets

 The land of lamping moon is bare and drear  O eyne of me pour forth
    the brimming tear
 They marched how shall I now be patient  That I nor heart nor
    patience own I swear
 O ye who marched yet bide in heart of me  Will you O lords of me
    return to that we were
 What harm if they return and I enjoy  Meeting and they had ruth on
    tears of care
 Upon the partingday they dimmed these eyne  For sad surprise and lit
    the flames that flare
 Sore longed I for their stay but Fortune stayed  Longings and turned
    my hope to mere despair
 Return to us O love by Allah deign  Enow of tears have flowed for
    absencebane

Then Hasan could no longer contain himself but took the cap from his
head whereupon his wife saw him and recognising him screamed a scream
which startled all in the palace and said to him How camest thou
hither From the sky hast thou dropped or through the earth hast thou
come up And her eyes brimmed with tears and Hasan also wept Quoth
she O man this be no time for tears or blame Fate hath had its
course and the sight was blinded and the Pen hath run with what was
ordained of Allah when Time was begun so Allah upon thee whencesoever
thou comest go hide lest any espy thee and tell my sister and she do
thee and me die Answered he O my lady and lady of all Queens I have
adventured myself and come hither and either I will die or I will
deliver thee from this strait and travel with thee and my children to my
country despite the nose of this thy wickedest sister But as she
heard his words she smiled and for awhile fell to shaking her head and
said Far O my life far is it from the power of any except Allah
Almighty to deliver me from this my strait Save thyself by flight and
wend thy ways and cast not thyself into destruction for she hath
conquering hosts none may withstand Given that thou tookest me and
wentest forth how canst thou make thy country and escape from these
islands and the perils of these awesome places Verily thou hast seen
on thy way hither the wonders the marvels the dangers and the terrors
of the road such as none may escape not even one of the rebel Jinns
Depart therefore forthright and add not cark to my cark and care to my
care neither do thou pretend to rescue me from this my plight for who
shall carry me to thy country through all these vales and thirsty wolds
and fatal steads Rejoined Hasan By thy life O light of mine eyes I
will not depart this place nor fare but with thee Quoth she O man
How canst thou avail unto this thing and what manner of man art thou
Thou knowest not what thou sayest None can escape from these realms
even had he command over Jinns Ifrits magicians chiefs of tribes and
Marids Save thyself and leave me perchance Allah will bring about good
after ill Answered Hasan O lady of fair ones I came not save to
deliver thee with this rod and with this cap And he told her what had
befallen him with the two boys but whilst he was speaking behold up
came the Queen and heard their speech Now when he was ware of her he
donned the cap and was hidden from sight and she entered and said to
the Princess O wanton who is he with whom thou wast talking
Answered Manar alSanar Who is with me that should talk with me
except these children Then the Queen took the whip and beat her
whilst Hasan stood by and looked on nor did she leave beating her till
she fainted whereupon she bade transport her to another place So they
loosed her and carried her to another chamber whilst Hasan followed
unseen There they cast her down senseless and stood gazing upon her
till she revived and recited these couplets

 I have sorrowed on account of our disunion with a sorrow that made the
    tears to overflow from my eyelids
 And I vowed that if Fortune reunite us I would never again mention our
    separation
 And I would say to the envious Die ye with regret By Allah I have now
    attained my desire
 Joy hath overwhelmed me to such a degree that by its excess it hath made
    me weep
 O eye how hath weeping become thy habit Thou weepest in joy as well as
    in sorrows

When she ceased her verse the slavegirls went out from her and Hasan
took off the cap whereupon his wife said to him See O man all this
befel me not save by reason of my having rebelled against thee and
transgressed thy commandment and gone forth without thy leave So
Allah upon thee blame me not for my sins and know that women never wot a
mans worth till they have lost him Indeed I have offended and done
evil but I crave pardon of Allah Almighty for whatso I did and if He
reunite us I will never again gainsay thee in aught no neverAnd
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say


       Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Twentyfourth Night

She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that Hasans wife
besought pardon of him saying Blame me not for my sin and indeed I
crave mercy of Allah Almighty Quoth Hasan and indeed his heart ached
for her Twas not thou that wast in fault nay the fault was mine
and mine only for I fared forth and left thee with one who knew not thy
rank neither thy worth nor thy degree But know O beloved of my heart
and fruit of my vitals and light of mine eyes that Allah blessed be
He hath ordained to me power of releasing thee so say me wouldst
thou have me carry thee to thy fathers home there to accomplish what
Allah decreeth unto thee or wilt thou forthright depart with me to mine
own country now that relief is come to thee Quoth she Who can
deliver me save the Lord of the Heavens Go to thy motherland and put
away from thee false hope for thou knowest not the perils of these
parts which an thou obey me not soon shalt thou sight And she
improvised these couplets

 On me and with me bides thy volunty  Why then such anger such despite
    to me
 Whateer befel us Heaven forbid that love  Fade for long time or eer
    forgotten be
 Ceased not the spy to haunt our sides till seen  Our love estranged
    and then estranged was he
 In truth I trusted to fair thoughts of thine  Though spake the wicked
    spy maliciously
 Well keep the secret twixt us twain and hold  Although the brand of
    blame unsheathed we see
 The livelong day in longing love I spend  Hoping acceptancemessage
    from my friend

Then wept she and her children and the handmaidens heard them so they
came in to them and found them weeping but saw not Hasan with them
wherefore they wept for ruth of them and damned Queen Nur alHuda Then
Hasan took patience till night came on and her guards had gone to their
sleepingplaces when he arose and girded his waist then went up to her
and loosing her kissed her on the head and between the eyes and pressed
her to his bosom saying How long have we wearied for our motherland
and for reunion there Is this our meeting in sleep or on wake Then
he took up the elder boy and she took up the younger and they went forth
the palace and Allah veiled them with the veil of His protection so
that they came safe to the outer gate which closed the entrance to the
Queens Serraglio But finding it locked from without Hasan said
There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the Glorious
the Great Verily we are Allahs and unto Him shall we return With
this they despaired of escape and Hasan beat hand upon hand saying O
Dispeller of dolours Indeed I had bethought me of every thing and
considered its conclusion but this and now when it is daybreak they
will take us and what device have we in this case And he recited the
following two couplets

 Thou madest fair thy thought of Fate whenas the days were fair And
    fearedst not the unknown ills that they to thee might bring
 The nights were fair and calm to thee thou wast deceived by them For
    in the peace of night is born full many a troublous thing

Then Hasan wept and his wife wept for his weeping and for the abasement
she had suffered and the cruelties of Time and Fortune

 Baulks me my Fate as tho she were my foe  Each day she showeth me new
    cark and care
 Fate when I aim at good brings clear reverse  And lets foul morrow
    wait on day thats fair

And also these

 Irks me my Fate and clean unknows that I  Of my high worth her shifts
    and shafts despise
 She nights parading what illwill she works  I night parading Patience
    to her eyes

Then his wife said to him By Allah there is no relief for us but to
kill ourselves and be at rest from this great and weary travail else we
shall suffer grievous torment on the morrow At this moment behold
they heard a voice from without the door say By Allah O my lady Manar
alSana I will not open to thee and thy husband Hasan except ye obey
me in whatso I shall say to you When they heard these words they were
silent for excess of fright and would have returned whence they came
when lo the voice spake again saying What aileth you both to be
silent and answer me not Therewith they knew the speaker for the old
woman Shawahi Lady of Calamities and said to her Whatsoever thou
biddest us that will we do but first open the door to us this being
no time for talk Replied she By Allah I will not open to you until
ye both swear to me that you will take me with you and not leave me with
yonder whore so whatever befalleth you shall befal me and if ye
escape I shall escape and if ye perish I shall perish for yonder
abominable woman tribade that she is entreateth me with indignity
and still tormenteth me on your account and thou O my daughter
knowest my worth Now recognising her they trusted in her and sware to
her an oath such as contented her whereupon she opened the door to them
and they fared forth and found her riding on a Greek jar of red
earthenware with a rope of palmfibres about its neck which rolled
under her and ran faster than a Najdi colt and she came up to them and
said Follow me and fear naught for I know forty modes of magic by the
least of which I could make this city a dashing sea swollen with
clashing billows and ensorcel each damsel therein to a fish and all
before dawn But I was not able to work aught of my mischief for fear
of the King her father and of regard to her sisters for that they are
formidable by reason of their many guards and tribesmen and servants
However soon will I show you wonders of my skill in witchcraft and now
let us on relying upon the blessing of Allah and His good aid Now
Hasan and his wife rejoiced in this making sure of escapeAnd
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say


       Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Twentyfifth Night

She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Hasan and
his wife accompanied by the ancient dame Shawahi fared forth from the
palace they made sure of deliverance and they walked on till they came
without the city when he fortified his heart and smiting the earth
with the rod cried Ho ye servants of these names appear to me and
acquaint me with your conditions Thereupon the earth clave asunder and
out came ten Ifrits with their feet in the bowels of the earth and
their heads in the clouds They kissed the earth three times before
Hasan and said as with one voice Adsumus Here are we at thy service
O our lord and ruler over us What dost thou bid us do For we hear and
obey thy commandment An thou wilt we will dry thee up seas and remove
mountains from their places So Hasan rejoiced in their words and at
their speedy answer to his evocation then taking courage and bracing up
his resolution he said to them Who are ye and what be your names and
your races and to what tribes and clans and companies appertain ye
They kissed the earth once more and answered as with one voice saying
We are seven Kings each ruling over seven tribes of the Jinn of all
conditions and Satans and Marids flyers and divers dwellers in
mountains and wastes and wolds and haunters of the seas so bid us do
whatso thou wilt for we are thy servants and thy slaves and whoso
possesseth this rod hath dominion over all our necks and we owe him
obedience Now when Hasan heard this he rejoiced with joy exceeding
as did his wife and the old woman and presently he said to the Kings of
the Jinn I desire of you that ye show me your tribes and hosts and
guards O our lord answered they if we show thee our tribes we
fear for thee and these who are with thee for their name is legion and
they are various in form and fashion figure and favour Some of us are
heads sans bodies and others bodies sans heads and others again are in
the likeness of wild beasts and ravening lions However if this be thy
will there is no help but we first show thee those of us who are like
unto wild beasts But O our lord what wouldst thou of us at this
present Quoth Hasan I would have you carry me forthwith to the city
of Baghdad me and my wife and this honest woman But hearing his
words they hung down their heads and were silent whereupon Hasan asked
them Why do ye not reply And they answered as with one voice O our
lord and ruler over us we are of the covenant of Solomon son of David
on the twain be Peace and he sware us in that we would bear none of
the sons of Adam on our backs since which time we have borne no mortal
on back or shoulder but we will straightway harness thee horses of the
Jinn that shall carry thee and thy company to thy country Hasan
enquired How far are we from Baghdad and they Seven years journey
for a diligent horseman Hasan marvelled at this and said to them
Then how came I hither in less than a year and they said Allah
softened to thee the hearts of His pious servants else hadst thou never
come to this country nor hadst thou set eyes on these regions no
never For the Shaykh Abd alKaddus who mounted thee on the elephant
and the magical horse traversed with thee in ten days three years
journey for a wellgirt rider and the Ifrit Dahnash to whom the Shaykh
committed thee carried thee a three years march in a day and a night
all which was of the blessing of Allah Almighty for that the Shaykh Abu
alRuwaysh is of the seed of saf bin Barkhiy and knoweth the Most
Great name of Allah Moreover from Baghdad to the palace of the
damsels is a years journey and this maketh up the seven years When
Hasan heard this he marvelled with exceeding marvel and cried Glory
be to God Facilitator of the hard Fortifier of the weak heart
Approximator of the far and Humbler of every froward tyrant Who hath
eased us of every accident and carried me to these countries and
subjected to me these creatures and reunited me with my wife and
children I know not whether I am asleep or awake or if I be sober or
drunken Then he turned to the Jinn and asked When ye have mounted me
upon your steeds in how many days will they bring us to Baghdad and
they answered They will carry you thither under the year but not till
after ye have endured terrible perils and hardships and horrors and ye
have traversed thirsty Wadys and frightful wastes and horrible steads
without number and we cannot promise thee safety O our lord from the
people of these islandsAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased to say her permitted say


       Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Twentysixth Night

She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Jann said to
Hasan We cannot promise thee safety O our lord from this Islandry
nor from the mischief of the Supreme King and his enchanters and
warlocks It may be they will overcome us and take you from us and we
fall into affliction with them and all to whom the tidings shall come
after this will say to usYe are wrongdoers How could ye go against
the Supreme King and carry a mortal out of his dominions and eke the
Kings daughter with him adding Wert thou alone with us the thing
were light but He who conveyed thee hither is capable to carry thee
back to thy country and reunite thee with thine own people forthright
and in readiest plight So take heart and put thy trust in Allah and
fear not for we are at thy service to convey thee to thy country
Hasan thanked them therefor and said Allah requite you with good but
now make haste with the horses they replied We hear and we obey
and struck the ground with their feet whereupon it opened and they
disappeared within it and were absent awhile after which they suddenly
reappeared with three horses saddled and bridled and on each
saddlebow a pair of saddlebags with a leathern bottle of water in one
pocket and the other full of provaunt So Hasan mounted one steed and
took a child before him whilst his wife mounted a second and took the
other child before her Then the old woman alighted from the jar and
bestrode the third horse and they rode on without ceasing all night
At break of day they turned aside from the road and made for the
mountain whilst their tongues ceased not to name Allah Then they fared
on under the highland all that day till Hasan caught sight of a black
object afar as it were a tall column of smoke atwisting skywards so he
recited somewhat of the Koran and Holy Writ and sought refuge with
Allah from Satan the Stoned The black thing grew plainer as they drew
near and when hard by it they saw that it was an Ifrit with a head
like a huge dome and tusks like grapnels and jaws like a lane and
nostrils like ewers and ears like leathern targes and mouth like a cave
and teeth like pillars of stone and hands like winnowing forks and legs
like masts his head was in the cloud and his feet in the bowels of the
earth had plowed Whenas Hasan gazed upon him he bowed himself and
kissed the ground before him saying O Hasan have no fear of me for
I am the chief of the dwellers in this land which is the first of the
Isles of Wak and I am a Moslem and an adorer of the One God I have
heard of you and your coming and when I knew of your case I desired to
depart from the land of the magicians to another land void of
inhabitants and far from men and Jinn that I might dwell there alone
and worship Allah till my fated end came upon me So I wish to accompany
you and be your guide till ye fare forth of the Wak Islands and I will
not appear save at night and do ye hearten your hearts on my account
for I am a Moslem even as ye are Moslems When Hasan heard the Ifrits
words he rejoiced with exceeding joy and made sure of deliverance and
he said to him Allah requite thee weal Go with us relying upon the
blessing of Allah So the Ifrit forewent them and they followed
talking and making merry for their hearts were pleased and their
breasts were eased and Hasan fell to telling his wife all that had
befallen him and all the hardships he had undergone whilst she excused
herself to him and told him in turn all she had seen and suffered
They ceased not faring all that nightAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn
of day and ceased saying her permitted say


      Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Twentyseventh Night

She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that they ceased not
faring all that night and the horses bore them like the blinding leven
and when the day rose all put their hands to the saddlebags and took
forth provaunt which they ate and water which they drank Then they sped
diligently on their way preceded by the Ifrit who turned aside with
them from the beaten track into another road till then untrodden along
the seashore and they ceased not faring on without stopping across
Wadys and wolds a whole month till on the thirtyfirst day there arose
before them a dustcloud that walled the world and darkened the day
and when Hasan saw this he was confused and turned pale and more so
when a frightful crying and clamour struck their ears Thereupon the old
woman said to him O my son this is the army of the Wak Islands that
hath overtaken us and presently they will lay violent hands on us
Hasan asked What shall I do O my mother and she answered Strike
the earth with the rod He did so whereupon the Seven Kings presented
themselves and saluted him with the salam kissing ground before him and
saying Fear not neither grieve Hasan rejoiced at these words and
answered them saying Well said O Princes of the Jinn and the Ifrits
This is your time Quoth they Get ye up to the mountaintop thou and
thy wife and children and she who is with thee and leave us to deal with
them for we know that you all are in the right and they in the wrong
and Allah will aid us against them So Hasan and his wife and children
and the old woman dismounted and dismissing the horses ascended the
flank of the mountainAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased to say her permitted say


       Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Twentyeighth Night

Illustration

She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that Hasan with
his wife his children and the ancient dame ascended the mountainflank
after they had dismissed the coursers Presently up came Queen Nur
alHuda with the troops right and left and the captains went round
about among the host and ranged them rank by rank in battle array Then
the hosts charged down upon each other and clashed together the twain
with a mighty strain the brave pressed on amain and the coward to fly
was fain and the Jinn cast flames of fire from their mouths whilst the
smoke of them rose up to the confines of the sky and the two armies
appeared and disappeared The champions fought and heads flew from
trunks and the blood ran in rills nor did brand leave to play and blood
to flow and battle fire to flow till the murk o night came when the
two hosts drew apart and alighting from their steeds rested upon the
field by the fires they had kindled Therewith the Seven Kings went up
to Hasan and kissed the earth before him He pressed forwards to meet
them and thanked them and prayed Allah to give them the victory and
asked them how they had fared with the Queens troops Quoth they They
will not withstand us more then three days for we had the better of
them today taking some two thousand of them prisoners and slaying of
them much folk whose compt may not be told So be of good cheer and
broad of breast Then they farewelled him and went down to look after
the safety of their troops and they ceased not to keep up the fires
till the morning rose with its sheen and shone when the fightingmen
mounted their horses of noble strain and smote one another with
thinedged skean and with brown of bill they thrust amain nor did they
cease that day battle to darraign Moreover they passed the night on
horseback clashing together like dashing seas raged among them the
fires of war and they stinted not from battle and jar till the armies
of Wak were defeated and their power broken and their courage quelled
their feet slipped and whither they fled soever defeat was before them
wherefore they turned tail and of flight began to avail but the most
part of them were slain and their Queen and her chief officers and the
grandees of her realm were captive taen When the morning morrowed the
Seven Kings presented themselves before Hasan and set for him a throne
of alabaster inlaid with pearls and jewels and he sat down thereon
They also set thereby a throne of ivory plated with glittering gold
for the Princess Manar al Sana and another for the ancient dame Shawahi
Zat alDawahi Then they brought before them the prisoners and among the
rest Queen Nur alHuda with elbows pinioned and feet fettered whom
when Shawahi saw she said to her Thy recompense O harlot O tyrant
shall be that two bitches be starved and two mares stinted of water
till they be athirst then shalt thou be bound to the mares tails and
these driven to the river with the bitches following thee that they may
rend thy skin and after thy flesh shall be cut off and given them to
eat How couldst thou do with thy sister such deed O strumpet seeing
that she was lawfully married after the ordinance of Allah and of His
Apostle For there is no monkery in AlIslam and marriage is one of the
institutions of the Apostles on whom be the Peace nor were women
created but for men Then Hasan commanded to put all the captives to
the sword and the old woman cried out saying Slay them all and spare
none But when Princess Manar alSana saw her sister in this
plight a bondswoman and in fetters she wept over her and said O my
sister who is this hath conquered us and made us captives in our own
country Quoth Nur alHuda Verily this is a mighty matter Indeed
this man Hasan hath gotten the mastery over us and Allah hath given him
dominion over us and over all our realm and he hath overcome us us and
the Kings of the Jinn And quoth her sister Indeed Allah aided him
not against you nor did he overcome you nor capture you save by means of
this cap and rod So Nur alHuda was certified and assured that he had
conquered her by means thereof and humbled herself to her sister till
she was moved to ruth for her and said to her husband What wilt thou
do with my sister Behold she is in thy hands and she hath done thee no
misdeed that thou shouldest punish her Replied Hasan Her torturing
of thee was misdeed enow But she answered saying She hath excuse
for all she did with me As for thee thou hast set my fathers heart on
fire for the loss of me and what will be his case if he lose my sister
also And he said to her Tis thine to decide do whatso thou wilt
So she bade loose her sister and the rest of the captives and they did
her bidding Then she went up to Queen Nur alHuda and embraced her and
they wept together a long while after which quoth the Queen O my
sister bear me not malice for that I did with thee and quoth Manar
alSana O my sister this was foreordained to me by Fate Then they
sat on the couch talking and Manar alSana made peace between the old
woman and her sister after the goodliest fashion and their hearts were
set at ease Thereupon Hasan dismissed the servants of the rod thanking
them for the succour which they had afforded him against his foes and
Manar alSana related to her sister all that had befallen her with Hasan
her husband and every thing he had suffered for her sake saying O my
sister since he hath done these deeds and is possessed of this might
and Allah Almighty hath gifted him with such exceeding prowess that he
hath entered our country and beaten thine army and taken thee prisoner
and defied our father the Supreme King who hath dominion over all the
Princes of the Jinn it behoveth us to fail not of what is due to him
Replied Nur alHuda By Allah O my sister thou sayest sooth in whatso
thou tellest me of the marvels which this man hath seen and suffered
and none may fail of respect to him But was all this on thine account
O my sisterAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying
her permitted say


       Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Twentyninth Night

She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Princess
Manar alSana repeated to her sister these praises of Hasan the other
replied By Allah this man can claim all respect more by token of his
generosity But was all this on thine account Yes answered Manar
alSana and they passed the night in converse till the morning morrowed
and the sun rose and they were minded to depart So they farewelled one
another and Manar alSana gave Godspeed to the ancient dame after the
reconciling her with Queen Nur alHuda Thereupon Hasan smote the earth
with the rod and its servants the Jinn appeared and saluted him saying
Praised be Allah who hath set thy soul at rest Command us what thou
wilt and we will do it for thee in less than the twinkling of an eye
He thanked them for their saying and said to them Allah requite you
with good Saddle me two steeds of the best So they brought him
forthwith two saddled coursers one of which he mounted taking his
elder son before him and his wife rode the other taking the younger
son in front of her Then the Queen and the old woman also backed horse
and departed Hasan and his wife following the right and Nur alHuda and
Shawahi the left hand road The spouses fared on with their children
without stopping for a whole month till they drew in sight of a city
which they found compassed about with trees and streams and making the
trees dismounted beneath them thinking to rest there As they sat
talking behold they saw many horsemen coming towards them whereupon
Hasan rose and going to meet them saw that it was King Hassun lord of
the Land of Camphor and Castle of Crystal with his attendants So Hasan
went up to the King and kissed his hands and saluted him and when
Hassun saw him he dismounted and seating himself with Hasan upon
carpets under the trees returned his salam and gave him joy of his
safety and rejoiced in him with exceeding joy saying to him O Hasan
tell me all that hath befallen thee first and last So he told him all
of that whereupon the King marvelled and said to him O my son none
ever reached the Islands of Wak and returned thence but thou and indeed
thy case is wondrous but Alhamdolillahpraised be Godfor safety Then
he mounted and bade Hasan ride with his wife and children into the city
where he lodged them in the guesthouse of his palace and they abode
with him three days eating and drinking in mirth and merriment after
which Hasan sought Hassuns leave to depart to his own country and the
King granted it Accordingly they took horse and the King rode with them
ten days after which he farewelled them and turned back whilst Hasan
and his wife and children fared on a whole month at the end of which
time they came to a great cavern whose floor was of brass Quoth Hasan
to his wife Kennest thou yonder cave and quoth she No Said he
Therein dwelleth a Shaykh Abu alRuwaysh hight to whom I am greatly
beholden for that he was the means of my becoming acquainted with King
Hassun Then he went on to tell her all that had passed between him and
Abu alRuwaysh and as he was thus engaged behold the Shaykh himself
issued from the cavernmouth When Hasan saw him he dismounted from his
steed and kissed his hands and the old man saluted him and gave him joy
of his safety and rejoiced in him Then he carried him into the antre
and sat down with him whilst Hasan related to him what had befallen him
in the Islands of Wak whereat the Elder marvelled with exceeding marvel
and said O Hasan how didst thou deliver thy wife and children So he
told them the tale of the cap and the rod hearing which he wondered and
said O Hasan O my son but for this rod and the cap thou hadst never
delivered thy wife and children And he replied Even so O my lord
As they were talking there came a knocking at the door and Abu
alRuwaysh went out and found Abd alKaddus mounted on his elephant So
he saluted him and brought him into the cavern where he embraced Hasan
and congratulated him on his safety rejoicing greatly in his return
Then said Abu alRuwaysh to Hasan Tell the Shaykh Abd alKaddus all
that hath befallen thee O Hasan He repeated to him every thing that
had passed first and last till he came to the tale of the rod and
capAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her
permitted say


         Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Thirtieth Night

She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that Hasan began
relating to Shaykh Abd alKaddus and Shaykh Abd alRuwaysh who sat
chatting in the cave all that had passed first and last till he came
to the tale of the rod and cap whereupon quoth Abd alKaddus O my
son thou hast delivered thy wife and thy children and hast no further
need of the two Now we were the means of thy winning to the Islands of
Wak and I have done thee kindness for the sake of my nieces the
daughters of my brother wherefore I beg thee of thy bounty and favour
to give me the rod and the Shaykh Abu alRuwaysh the cap When Hasan
heard this he hung down his head being ashamed to reply I will not
give them to you and said in his mind Indeed these two Shaykhs have
done me great kindness and were the means of my winning to the Islands
of Wak and but for them I had never made the place nor delivered my
children nor had I gotten me this rod and cap So he raised his head
and answered Yes I will give them to you but O my lords I fear
lest the Supreme King my wifes father come upon me with his commando
and combat with me in my own country and I be unable to repel them for
want of the rod and the cap Replied Abd alKaddus Fear not O my
son we will continually succour thee and keep watch and ward for thee
in this place and whosoever shall come against thee from thy wifes
father or any other him we will fend off from thee wherefore be thou
of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool of tear and hearten thy heart
and broaden thy breast and feel naught whatsoever of fear for no harm
shall come to thee When Hasan heard this he was abashed and gave the
cap to Abu alRuwaysh saying to Abd alKaddus Accompany me to my own
country and I will give thee the rod At this the two elders rejoiced
with exceeding joy and made him ready riches and treasures which beggar
all description He abode with them three days at the end of which he
set out again and the Shaykh Abd alKaddus made ready to depart with
him So he and his wife mounted their beasts and Abd alKaddus whistled
when behold a mighty big elephant trotted up with fore hand and feet
on amble from the heart of the desert and he took it and mounted it
Then they farewelled Abu alRuwaysh who disappeared within his cavern
and they fared on across country traversing the land in its length and
breadth wherever Abd alKaddus guided them by a short cut and an easy
way till they drew near the land of the Princesses whereupon Hasan
rejoiced at finding himself once more near his mother and praised Allah
for his safe return and reunion with his wife and children after so many
hardships and perils and thanked Him for His favours and bounties
reciting these couplets

 Haply shall Allah deign us twain unite  And lockt in strict embrace
    well hail the light
 And wonders that befel me Ill recount  And all I suffered from the
    Severanceblight
 And fain Ill cure mine eyes by viewing you  For ever yearned my heart
    to see your sight
 I hid a tale for you my heart within  Which when we meet o morn Ill
    fain recite
 Ill blame you for the deeds by you were done  But while blame endeth
    love shall stay in site

Hardly had he made an end of these verses when he looked and behold
there rose to view the Green Dome and the Jetting Fount and the
Emerald Palace and the Mountain of Clouds showed to them from afar
whereupon quoth Abd alKaddus Rejoice O Hasan in good tidings
tonight shalt thou be the guest of my nieces At this he joyed with
exceeding joy and as also did his wife and they alighted at the domed
pavilion where they took their rest and ate and drank after which
they mounted horse again and rode on till they came upon the palace As
they drew near the Princesses who were daughters of the King brother
to Shaykh Abd alKaddus came forth to meet them and saluted them and
their uncle who said to them O daughters of my brother behold I have
accomplished the need of this your brother Hasan and have helped him to
regain his wife and children So they embraced him and gave him joy of
his return in safety and health and of his reunion with his wife and
children and it was a day of festival with them Then came forward
Hasans sister the youngest Princess and embraced him weeping with
sore weeping whilst he also wept for his long desolation after which
she complained to him of that which she had suffered for the pangs of
separation and weariness of spirit in his absence and recited these two
couplets

 After thy faring never chanced Ispy  A shape but did thy form therein
    descry
 Nor closed mine eyes in sleep but thee I saw  Een as though dwelling
    twixt the lid and eye

When she had made an end of her verses she rejoiced with joy exceeding
and Hasan said to her O my sister I thank none in this matter save
thyself over all thy sisters and may Allah Almighty vouchsafe thee
aidance and countenance Then he related to her all that had past in
his journey from first to last and all that he had undergone telling
her what had betided him with his wifes sister and how he had delivered
his wife and wees and he also described to her all that he had seen of
marvels and grievous perils even to how Queen Nur alHuda would have
slain him and his spouse and children and none saved them from her but
the Lord the Most High Moreover he related to her the adventure of the
cap and the rod and how Abd alKaddus and Abu alRuwaysh had asked for
them and he had not agreed to give them to the twain save for her sake
wherefore she thanked him and blessed him wishing him long life and he
cried By Allah I shall never forget all the kindness thou hast done
me from incept to conclusionAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day
and ceased saying her permitted say


       Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Thirtyfirst Night

She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Hasan
foregathered with the Princesses he related to his sister all that he
had endured and said to her Never will I forget what thou hast done
for me from incept to conclusion Then she turned to his wife Manar
alSana and embraced her and pressed her children to her breast saying
to her O daughter of the Supreme King was there no pity in thy bosom
that thou partedst him and his children and settedst his heart on fire
for them Say me didst thou desire by this deed that he should die
The Princess laughed and answered Thus was it ordained of Allah
extolled and exalted be He and whoso beguileth folk him shall Allah
beguile Then they set on somewhat of meat and drink and they all
ate and drank and made merry They abode thus ten days in feast and
festival mirth and merrymaking at the end of which time Hasan prepared
to continue his journey So his sister rose and made him ready riches
and rarities such as defy description Then she strained him to her
bosom because of leavetaking and threw her arms round his neck whilst
he recited on her account these couplets

 The solace of lovers is naught but far  And parting is naught save
    grief singular
 And illwill and absence are naught but woe  And the victims of Love
    naught but martyrs are
 And how tedious is night to the loving wight  From his true love parted
    neath evening star
 His tears course over his cheeks and so  He cries O tears be there
    more to flow

With this Hasan gave the rod to Shaykh Abd alKaddus who joyed therein
with exceeding joy and thanking him and securing it mounted and returned
to his own place Then Hasan took horse with his wife and children and
departed from the Palace of the Princesses who went forth with
him to farewell him Then they turned back and Hasan fared on over
wild and wold two months and ten days till he came to the city of
Baghdad the House of Peace and repairing to his home by the private
postern which gave upon the open country knocked at the door Now his
mother for long absence had forsworn sleep and given herself to
mourning and weeping and wailing till she fell sick and ate no meat
neither took delight in slumber but shed tears night and day She ceased
not to call upon her sons name albeit she despaired of his returning to
her and as he stood at the door he heard her weeping and reciting
these couplets

 By Allah heal O my lords the unwhole  Of wasted frame and heart worn
    with dole
 An you grant her a meeting tis but your grace  Shall whelm in the
    boons of the friend her soul
 I despair not of Union the Lord can grant  And to weal of meeting our
    woes control

When she had ended her verses she heard her sons voice at the door
calling out O mother mother ah fortune hath been kind and hath
vouchsafed our reunion Hearing his cry she knew his voice and went to
the door between belief and misbelief but when she opened it she saw
him standing there and with him his wife and children so she shrieked
aloud for excess of joy and fell to the earth in a faintingfit Hasan
ceased not soothing her till she recovered and embraced him then she
wept with joy and presently she called his slaves and servants and bade
them carry all his baggage into the house So they brought in every
one of the loads and his wife and children entered also whereupon
Hasans mother went up to the Princess and kissed her head and bussed
her feet saying O daughter of the Supreme King if I have failed of
thy due behold I crave pardon of Almighty Allah Then she turned to
Hasan and said to him O my son what was the cause of this long
strangerhood He related to her all his adventures from beginning to
end and when she heard tell of all that had befallen him she cried a
great cry and fell down afainting at the very mention of his mishaps
He solaced her till she came to herself and said By Allah O my son
thou hast done unwisely in parting with the rod and the cap for hadst
thou kept them with the care due to them thou wert master of the whole
earth in its breadth and length but praised be Allah for thy safety
O my son and that of thy wife and children They passed the night in
all pleasance and happiness and on the morrow Hasan changed his clothes
and donning a suit of the richest apparel went down into the bazar and
bought black slaves and slavegirls and the richest stuffs and ornaments
and furniture such as carpets and costly vessels and all manner other
precious things whose like is not found with Kings Moreover he
purchased houses and gardens and estates and so forth and abode with his
wife and his children and his mother eating and drinking and
pleasuring nor did they cease from all joy of life and its solace till
there came to them the Destroyer of delights and the Severer of
societies And Glory be to Him who hath dominion over the Seen and the
Unseen who is the Living the Eternal Who dieth not at all And
men also recount the adventures of

                   KHALIFAH THE FISHERMAN OF BAGHDAD


There was once in tides of yore and in ages and times long gone before
in the city of Baghdad a fisherman Khalfah hight a pauper wight who
had never once been married in all his days It chanced one
morning that he took his net and went with it to the river as was his
wont with the view of fishing before the others came When he reached
the bank he girt himself and tucked up his skirts then stepping into
the water he spread his net and cast it a first cast and a second but
it brought up naught He ceased not to throw it till he had made ten
casts and still naught came up therein wherefore his breast was
straitened and his mind perplexed concerning his case and he said I
crave pardon of God the Great there is no god but He the Living the
Eternal and unto Him I repent There is no Majesty and there is no
Might save in Allah the Glorious the Great Whatso He willeth is and
whatso He nilleth is not Upon Allah to whom belong Honour and Glory
dependeth daily bread Whenas He giveth to His servant none denieth
him and whenas He denieth a servant none giveth to him And of the
excess of his distress he recited these two couplets

 An Fate afflict thee with grief manifest  Prepare thy patience and
    make broad thy breast
 For of His grace the Lord of all the worlds  Shall send to wait upon
    unrest sweet Rest

Then he sat awhile pondering his case and with his head bowed down
recited also these couplets

 Patience with sweet and with bitter Fate  And weet that His will He
    shall consummate
 Night oft upon woe as on abscess acts  And brings it up to the bursting
    state
 And Chance and Change shall pass oer the youth  And fleet from his
    thoughts and no more shall bait

Then he said in his mind I will make this one more cast trusting in
Allah so haply He may not disappoint my hope and he rose and casting
into the river the net as far as his arm availed gathered the cords in
his hands and waited a full hour after which he pulled at it and
finding it heavyAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to
say her permitted say


       Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Thirtysecond Night

She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Khalifah
the Fisherman had cast his net sundry times into the stream yet had it
brought up naught he pondered his case and improvised the verses afore
quoted Then he said in his mind I will make this one more cast
trusting in Allah who haply will not disappoint my hope So he rose and
threw the net and waited a full hour after which time he pulled at it
and finding it heavy handled it gently and drew it in little by
little till he got it ashore when lo and behold he saw in it a
oneeyed lamelegged ape Seeing this quoth Khalifah There is no
Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah Verily we are Allahs and
to Him we are returning What meaneth this heartbreaking miserable
illluck and hapless fortune What is come to me this blessed day But
all this is of the destinies of Almighty Allah Then he took the ape
and tied him with a cord to a tree which grew on the riverbank and
grasping a whip he had with him raised his arm in the air thinking to
bring down the scourge upon the quarry when Allah made the ape speak
with a fluent tongue saying O Khalifah hold thy hand and beat me
not but leave me bounden to this tree and go down to the river and cast
thy net confiding in Allah for He will give thee thy daily bread
Hearing this Khalifah went down to the river and casting his net let
the cords run out Then he pulled it in and found it heavier than
before so he ceased not to tug at it till he brought it to land when
behold there was another ape in it with front teeth wide apart
Kohldarkened eyes and hands stained with Hennadyes and he was
laughing and wore a tattered waistcloth about his middle Quoth
Khalifah Praised be Allah who hath changed the fish of the river into
apes Then going up to the first ape who was still tied to the
tree he said to him See O unlucky how fulsome was the counsel thou
gavest me None but thou made me light on this second ape and for that
thou gavest me goodmorrow with thy one eye and thy lameness I am
become distressed and weary without dirham or dinar So saying he
hent in hand a stick and flourishing it thrice in the air was
about to come down with it upon the lame ape when the creature cried
out for mercy and said to him I conjure thee by Allah spare me for
the sake of this my fellow and seek of him thy need for he will guide
thee to thy desire So he held his hand from him and throwing down the
stick went up to and stood by the second ape who said to him O
Khalifah this my speech will profit thee naught except thou
hearken to what I say to thee but an thou do my bidding and cross me
not I will be the cause of thine enrichment Asked Khalifah And what
hast thou to say to me that I may obey thee therein The Ape answered
Leave me bound on the bank and hie thee down to the river then cast
thy net a third time and after I will tell thee what to do So he took
his net and going down to the river cast it once more and waited
awhile Then he drew it in and finding it heavy laboured at it and
ceased not his travail till he got it ashore when he found in it yet
another ape but this one was red with a blue waistcloth about his
middle his hands and feet were stained with Henna and his eyes
blackened with Kohl When Khalifah saw this he exclaimed Glory to God
the Great Extolled be the perfection of the Lord of Dominion Verily
this is a blessed day from first to last its ascendant was fortunate in
the countenance of the first ape and the scroll is known by its
superscription Verily today is a day of apes there is not a single
fish left in the river and we are come out today but to catch
monkeys Then he turned to the third ape and said And what thing art
thou also O unlucky Quoth the ape Dost thou not know me O
Khalifah and quoth he Not I The ape cried I am the ape of Abu
alSadt the Jew the shroff Asked Khalifah And what dost
thou for him and the ape answered I give him goodmorrow at the
first of the day and he gaineth five ducats and again at the end of
the day I give him goodeven and he gaineth other five ducats
Whereupon Khalifah turned to the first ape and said to him See O
unlucky what fine apes other folk have As for thee thou givest me
goodmorrow with thy one eye and thy lameness and thy illomened phiz
and I become poor and bankrupt and hungry So saying he took the
cattlestick and flourishing it thrice in the air was about to come
down with it on the first ape when Abu alSaadats ape said to him
Let him be O Khalifah hold thy hand and come hither to me that I may
tell thee what to do So Khalifah threw down the stick and walking up
to him cried And what hast thou to say to me O monarch of all
monkeys Replied the ape Leave me and the other two apes here and
take thy net and cast it into the river and whatever cometh up bring
it to me and I will tell thee what shall gladden theeAnd Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say


       Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Thirtythird Night

She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that the ape of Abu
alSaadat said to Khalifah Take thy net and cast it into the river
and whatever cometh up bring it to me and I will tell thee what shall
gladden thee He replied I hear and obey and took the net and
gathered it on his shoulder reciting these couplets

 When straitened is my breast I will of my Creator pray  Who may and
    can the heaviest weight lighten in easiest way
 For ere mans glance can turn or close his eye by God His grace  Waxeth
    the broken whole and yieldeth jail its prisonprey
 Therefore with Allah one and all of thy concerns commit  Whose grace
    and favour men of wit shall nevermore gainsay

And also these twain

 Thou art the cause that castest men in ban and bane  Sorrow een so
    and sorrows cause Thou canst assain
 Make me not covet aught that lies beyond my reach  How many a greedy
    wight his wish hath failed to gain

Now when Khalifah had made an end of his verse he went down to the
river and casting his net waited awhile after which he drew it up and
found therein a fine young fish with a big head a tail like a
ladle and eyes like two gold pieces When Khalifah saw this fish he
rejoiced for he had never in his life caught its like so he took it
marvelling and carried it to the ape of Abu alSaadat the Jew as
twere he had gotten possession of the universal world Quoth the ape
O Khalifah what wilt thou do with this and with thine ape and quoth
the Fisherman I will tell thee O monarch of monkeys all I am about to
do Know then that first I will cast about to make away with yonder
accursed my ape and take thee in his stead and give thee every day to
eat of whatso thou wilt Rejoined the ape Since thou hast made choice
of me I will tell thee how thou shalt do wherein if it please Allah
Almighty shall be the mending of thy fortune Lend thy mind then to
what I say to thee and tis this Take another cord and tie me also to a
tree where leave me and go to the midst of The Dyke and cast thy
net into the Tigris Then after waiting awhile draw it up and thou
shalt find therein a fish than which thou never sawest a finer in thy
whole life Bring it to me and I will tell thee how thou shalt do after
this So Khalifah rose forthright and casting his net into the Tigris
drew up a great catfish the bigness of a lamb never had he set
eyes on its like for it was larger than the first fish He carried it
to the ape who said to him Gather thee some green grass and set half
of it in a basket lay the fish therein and cover it with the other
moiety Then leaving us here tied shoulder the basket and betake thee
to Baghdad If any bespeak thee or question thee by the way answer him
not but fare on till thou comest to the marketstreet of the
moneychangers at the upper end whereof thou wilt find the shop of
Master Abu alSaadat the Jew Shaykh of the shroffs and wilt see
him sitting on a mattress with a cushion behind him and two coffers
one for gold and one for silver before him while around him stand his
Mamelukes and negroslaves and servantlads Go up to him and set the
basket before him sayingO Abu alSaadat verily I went out today
to fish and cast my net in thy name and Allah Almighty sent me this
fish He will ask Hast thou shown it to any but me and do thou
answer No by Allah Then will he take it of thee and give thee a
dinar Give it him back and he will give thee two dinars but do thou
return them also and so do with everything he may offer thee and take
naught from him though he give thee the fishs weight in gold Then
will he say to thee Tell me what thou wouldst have and do thou reply
By Allah I will not sell the fish save for two words He will ask What
are they And do thou answer Stand up and say Bear witness O ye who
are present in the market that I give Khalifah the fisherman my ape in
exchange for his ape and that I barter for his lot my lot and luck for
his luck This is the price of the fish and I have no need of gold If
he do this I will every day give thee goodmorrow and goodeven and
every day thou shalt gain ten dinars of good gold whilst this oneeyed
lamelegged ape shall daily give the Jew goodmorrow and Allah shall
afflict him every day with an avanie which he must needs pay nor
will he cease to be thus afflicted till he is reduced to beggary and
hath naught Hearken then to my words so shalt thou prosper and be
guided aright Quoth Khalifah I accept thy counsel O monarch of all
the monkeys But as for this unlucky may Allah never bless him I know
not what to do with him Quoth the ape Let him go into the
water and let me go also I hear and obey answered Khalifah and
unbound the three apes and they went down into the river Then he took
up the catfish which he washed then laid it in the basket upon
some green grass and covered it with other and lastly shouldering his
load set out chanting the following Mawwl

 Thy case commit to a Heavenly Lord and thou shalt safety see  Act
    kindly through thy worldly life and live repentancefree
 Mate not with folk suspected lest eke thou shouldst suspected be  And
    from reviling keep thy tongue lest men revile at thee

And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her
permitted say


       Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Thirtyfourth Night

She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that Khalifah the
Fisherman after ending his song set out with the basket upon his
shoulder and ceased not faring till he entered the city of Baghdad And
as he threaded the streets the folk knew him and cried out to him
saying What hast thou there O Khalifah But he paid no heed to them
and passed on till he came to the marketstreet of the moneychangers
and fared between the shops as the ape had charged him till he found
the Jew seated at the upper end with his servants in attendance upon
him as he were a King of the Kings of Khorasan He knew him at first
sight so he went up to him and stood before him whereupon Abu
alSaadat raised his eyes and recognising him said Welcome O
Khalifah What wantest thou and what is thy need If any have missaid
thee or spited thee tell me and I will go with thee to the Chief of
Police who shall do thee justice on him Replied Khalifah Nay as
thy head liveth O chief of the Jews none hath missaid me But I went
forth this morning to the river and casting my net into the Tigris on
thy luck brought up this fish Therewith he opened the basket and
threw the fish before the Jew who admired it and said By the
Pentateuch and the Ten Commandments I dreamt last night that the
Virgin came to me and saidKnow O Abu alSaadat that I have sent
thee a pretty present And doubtless tis this fish Then he turned to
Khalifah and said to him By thy faith hath any seen it but I
Khalifah replied No by Allah and by Abu Bakr the Viridical
none hath seen it save thou O chief of the Jews Whereupon the Jew
turned to one of his lads and said to him Come carry this fish to my
house and bid Sadah dress it and fry and broil it against I make
an end of my business and hie me home And Khalifah said Go O my
lad let the masters wife fry some of it and broil the rest Answered
the boy I hear and I obey O my lord and taking the fish went away
with it to the house Then the Jew put out his hand and gave Khalifah
the fisherman a dinar saying Take this for thyself O Khalifah and
spend it on thy family When Khalifah saw the dinar on his palm he
took it saying Laud to the Lord of Dominion as if he had never seen
aught of gold in his life and went somewhat away but before he had
gone far he was minded of the apes charge and turning back threw down
the ducat saying Take thy gold and give folk back their fish Dost
thou make a laughing stock of folk The Jew hearing this thought he was
jesting and offered him two dinars upon the other but Khalifah said
Give me the fish and no nonsense How knewest thou I would sell it at
this price Whereupon the Jew gave him two more dinars and said Take
these five ducats for thy fish and leave greed So Khalifah hent the
five dinars in hand and went away rejoicing and gazing and marvelling
at the gold and saying Glory be to God There is not with the Caliph
of Baghdad what is with me this day Then he ceased not faring on till
he came to the end of the marketstreet when he remembered the words of
the ape and his charge and returning to the Jew threw him back the
gold Quoth he What aileth thee O Khalifah Dost thou want silver in
exchange for gold Khalifah replied I want nor dirhams nor dinars I
only want thee to give me back folks fish With this the Jew waxed
wroth and shouted out at him saying O fisherman thou bringest me a
fish not worth a sequin and I give thee five for it yet art thou not
content Art thou Jinnmad Tell me for how much thou wilt sell it
Answered Khalifah I will not sell it for silver nor for gold only for
two sayings thou shalt say me When the Jew heard speak of the
Two Sayings his eyes sank into his head he breathed hard and ground
his teeth for rage and said to him O nailparing of the Moslems wilt
thou have me throw off my faith for the sake of thy fish and wilt thou
debauch me from my religion and stultify my belief and my conviction
which I inherited of old from my forbears Then he cried out to the
servants who were in waiting and said Out on you Bash me this unlucky
rogues neck and bastinado him soundly So they came down upon him with
blows and ceased not beating him till he fell beneath the shop and the
Jew said to them Leave him and let him rise Whereupon Khalifah
jumped up as if naught ailed him and the Jew said to him Tell me
what price thou asketh for this fish and I will give it thee for thou
hast gotten but scant good of us this day Answered the Fisherman
Have no fear for me O master because of the beating for I can eat
ten donkeys rations of stick The Jew laughed at his words and said
Allah upon thee tell me what thou wilt have and by the right of my
Faith I will give it thee The Fisherman replied Naught from thee
will remunerate me for this fish save the two words whereof I spake
And the Jew said Meseemeth thou wouldst have me become a Moslem
Khalifah rejoined By Allah O Jew an thou islamise twill nor
advantage the Moslems nor damage the Jews and in like manner an thou
hold to thy misbelief twill nor damage the Moslems nor advantage the
Jews But what I desire of thee is that thou rise to thy feet and
sayBear witness against me O people of the market that I barter my
ape for the ape of Khalifah the Fisherman and my lot in the world for
his lot and my luck for his luck Quoth the Jew If this be all thou
desirest twill sit lightly upon meAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn
of day and ceased saying her permitted say


       Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Thirtyfifth Night

She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Jew said to
Khalifah the Fisherman If this be all thou desirest twill sit
lightly upon me So he rose without stay or delay and standing on his
feet repeated the required words after which he turned to the
Fisherman and asked him Hast thou aught else to ask of me No
answered he and the Jew said Go in peace Hearing this Khalifah
sprung to his feet forthright took up his basket and net and returned
straight to the Tigris where he threw his net and pulled it in He
found it heavy and brought it not ashore but with travail when he found
it full of fish of all kinds Presently up came a woman with a dish
who gave him a dinar and he gave her fish for it and after her an
eunuch who also bought a dinars worth of fish and so forth till he
had sold ten dinars worth And he continued to sell ten dinars worth
of fish daily for ten days till he had gotten an hundred dinars Now
Khalifah the Fisherman had quarters in the Passage of the
Merchants and as he lay one night in his lodging much bemused
with Hashsh he said to himself O Khalifah the folk all know thee
for a poor fisherman and now thou hast gotten an hundred golden dinars
Needs must the Commander of the Faithful Harun alRashid hear of this
from some one and haply he will be wanting money and will send for thee
and say to theeI need a sum of money and it hath reached me that thou
hast an hundred dinars so do thou lend them to me those same I shall
answer O Commander of the Faithful I am a poor man and whoso told
thee that I had an hundred dinars lied against me for I have naught of
this Thereupon he will commit me to the Chief of Police
sayingStrip him of his clothes and torment him with the bastinado
till he confess and give up the hundred dinars in his possession
Wherefore meseemeth to provide against this predicament the best thing
I can do is to rise forthright and bash myself with the whip so to use
myself to beating And his Hashish said to him Rise doff thy
dress So he stood up and putting off his clothes took a whip he had
by him and set handy a leathern pillow then he fell to lashing himself
laying every other blow upon the pillow and roaring out the while
Alas Alas By Allah tis a false saying O my lord and they have
lied against me for I am a poor fisherman and have naught of the goods
of the world The noise of the whip falling on the pillow and on his
person resounded in the still of night and the folk heard it and
amongst others the merchants and they said Whatever can ail the poor
fellow that he crieth and we hear the noise of blows falling on him
Twould seem robbers have broken in upon him and are tormenting him
Presently they all came forth of their lodgings at the noise of the
blows and the crying and repaired to Khalifahs room but they found
the door locked and said one to other Belike the robbers have come in
upon him from the back of the adjoining saloon It behoveth us to climb
over by the roofs So they clomb over the roofs and coming down through
the skylight saw him naked and flogging himself and asked him
What aileth thee O Khalifah He answered Know O folk that I have
gained some dinars and fear lest my case be carried up to the Prince of
True Believers Harun alRashid and he send for me and demand of me
those same gold pieces whereupon I should deny and I fear that if I
deny he will torture me so I am torturing myself by way of
accustoming me to what may come The merchants laughed at him and said
Leave this fooling may Allah not bless thee and the dinars thou hast
gotten Verily thou hast disturbed us this night and hast troubled our
hearts So Khalifah left flogging himself and slept till the morning
when he rose and would have gone about his business but bethought him
of his hundred dinars and said in his mind An I leave them at home
thieves will steal them and if I put them in a belt about my
waist peradventure some one will see me and lay in wait for me till he
come upon me in some lonely place and slay me and take the money but I
have a device that should serve me well right well So he jumped up
forthright and made him a pocket in the collar of his gaberdine and
tying the hundred dinars up in a purse laid them in the collarpocket
Then he took his net and basket and staff and went down to the
TigrisAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her
permitted say


       Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Thirtysixth Night

She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Khalifah the
Fisherman having set his hundred dinars in the collarpocket took
basket staff and net and went down to the Tigris where he made a cast
but brought up naught So he removed from that place to another and
threw again but once more the net came up empty and he went on
removing from place to place till he had gone half a days journey from
the city ever casting the net which kept bringing up naught So he said
to himself By Allah I will throw my net astream but this once more
whether ill come of it or weal Then he hurled the net with all
his force of the excess of his wrath and the purse with the hundred
dinars flew out of his collarpocket and lighting in midstream was
carried away by the strong current whereupon he threw down the net and
doffing his clothes left them on the bank and plunged into the water
after the purse He dived for it nigh a hundred times till his strength
was exhausted and he came up for sheer fatigue without chancing on it
When he despaired of finding the purse he returned to the shore where
he saw nothing but staff net and basket and sought for his clothes but
could light on no trace of them so he said in himself O vilest of
those wherefor was made the bywordThe pilgrimage is not perfected save
by copulation with the camel Then he wrapped the net about him
and taking staff in one hand and basket in other went trotting about
like a camel in rut running right and left and backwards and forwards
dishevelled and dusty as he were a rebel Marid let loose from Solomons
prison So far for what concerns the Fisherman Khalifah but as
regards the Caliph Harun alRashid he had a friend a jeweller called
Ibn alKirns and all the traders brokers and middlemen knew him
for the Caliphs merchant wherefore there was naught sold in Baghdad
by way of rarities and things of price or Mamelukes or handmaidens but
was first shown to him As he sat one day in his shop behold there
came up to him the Shaykh of the brokers with a slavegirl whose like
seers never saw for she was of passing beauty and loveliness symmetry
and perfect grace and among her gifts was that she knew all arts and
sciences and could make verses and play upon all manner musical
instruments So Ibn alKirnas bought her for five thousand golden dinars
and clothed her with other thousand after which he carried her to the
Prince of True Believers with whom she lay the night and who made trial
of her in every kind of knowledge and accomplishment and found her
versed in all sorts of arts and sciences having no equal in her time
Her name was Kt alKulb and she was even as saith the poet

 I fix my glance on her wheneer she wends  And nonacceptance of my
    glance breeds pain
 She favours gracefulnecked gazelle at gaze  And Graceful as gazelle
    to say were fain

And where is this beside the saying of another

 Give me brunettes the Syrian spears so limber and so straight Tell of
    the slender dusky maids so lithe and proud of gait
 Languid of eyelids with a down like silk upon her cheek Within her
    wasting lovers heart she queens it still in state

On the morrow the Caliph sent for Ibn alKirnas the Jeweller and bade
him receive ten thousand dinars to her price And his heart was taken up
with the slavegirl Kut alKulub and he forsook the Lady Zubaydah bint
alKasim for all she was the daughter of his fathers brother and
he abandoned all his favourite concubines and abode a whole month
without stirring from Kut alKulubs side save to go to the Friday
prayers and return to her all in haste This was grievous to the Lords
of the Realm and they complained thereof to the Wazir Jaafar the
Barmecide who bore with the Commander of the Faithful and waited till
the next Friday when he entered the cathedralmosque and foregathering
with the Caliph related to him all that occurred to him of
extraordinary stories anent seldseen love and lovers with intent to
draw out what was in his mind Quoth the Caliph By Allah O Jaafar
this is not of my choice but my heart is caught in the snare of love
and wot I not what is to be done The Wazir Jaafar replied O
Commander of the Faithful thou knowest how this girl Kut alKulub is
become at thy disposal and of the number of thy servants and that which
hand possesseth soul coveteth not Moreover I will tell thee another
thing which is that the highest boast of Kings and Princes is in hunting
and the pursuit of sport and victory and if thou apply thyself to this
perchance it will divert thee from her and it may be thou wilt forget
her Rejoined the Caliph Thou sayest well O Jaafar come let us go
ahunting forthright without stay or delay So soon as Friday prayers
were prayed they left the mosque and at once mounting their shemules
rode forth to the chaseAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased saying her permitted say


      Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Thirtyseventh Night

She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the
Caliph Harun alRashid and the Wazir Jaafar would go forth ahunting
and achasing they mounted two shemules and fared on into the open
country occupied with talk and their attendants outwent them
Presently the heat became overhot and AlRashid said to his Wazir O
Jaafar I am sore athirst Then he looked around and espying a figure
in the distance on a high mound asked Jaafar Seest thou what I see
Answered the Wazir Yes O Commander of the Faithful I see a dim
figure on a high mound belike he is the keeper of a garden or of a
cucumberplot and in whatso wise water will not be lacking in his
neighbourhood presently adding I will go to him and fetch thee
some But AlRashid said My mule is swifter than thy mule so do thou
abide here on account of the troops whilst I go myself to him and get
of this person drink and return So saying he urged his shemule
which started off like racing wind or railingwater and in the
twinkling of an eye made the mound where he found the figure he had
seen to be none other than Khalifah the Fisherman naked and wrapped in
the net and indeed he was horrible to behold as to and fro he rolled
with eyes for very redness like cressetgleam and dusty hair in
dishevelled trim as he were an Ifrit or a lion grim AlRashid saluted
him and he returned his salutation but he was wroth and fires might
have been lit at his breath Quoth the Caliph O man hast thou any
water and quoth Khalifah Ho thou art thou blind or Jinnmad Get
thee to the river Tigris for tis behind this mound So AlRashid went
around the mound and going down to the river drank and watered his
mule then without a moments delay he returned to Khalifah and said to
him What aileth thee O man to stand here and what is thy calling
The Fisherman cried This is a stranger and sillier question than that
about the water Seest thou not the gear of my craft on my shoulder
Said the Caliph Belike thou art a fisherman and he replied Yes
Asked AlRashid Where is thy gaberdine and where are thy
waistcloth and girdle and where be the rest of thy raiment Now these
were the very things which had been taken from Khalifah like for like
so when he heard the Caliph name them he got into his head that it was
he who had stolen his clothes from the riverbank and coming down from
the top of the mound swiftlier than the blinding leven laid hold of
the mules bridle saying Harkye man bring me back my things and
leave jesting and joking AlRashid replied By Allah I have not seen
thy clothes nor know aught of them Now the Caliph had large cheeks
and a small mouth so Khalifah said to him Belike thou art by
trade a singer or a piper on pipes But bring me back my clothes fairly
and without more ado or I will bash thee with this my staff till thou
bepiss thyself and befoul thy clothes When AlRashid saw the staff in
the Fishermans hand and that he had the vantage of him he said to
himself By Allah I cannot brook from this mad beggar half a blow of
that staff Now he had on a satin gown so he pulled it off and gave it
to Khalifah saying O man take this in place of thy clothes The
Fisherman took it and turned it about and said My clothes are worth
ten of this painted Abcloak and rejoined the Caliph Put it on
till I bring thee thy gear So Khalifah donned the gown but finding it
too long for him took a knife he had with him tied to the handle of
his basket and cut off nigh a third of the skirt so that it fell
only beneath his knees Then he turned to AlRashid and said to him
Allah upon thee O piper tell me what wage thou gettest every month
from thy master for thy craft of piping Replied the Caliph My wage
is ten dinars a month and Khalifah continued By Allah my poor
fellow thou makest me sorry for thee Why I make thy ten dinars every
day Hast thou a mind to take service with me and I will teach thee the
art of fishing and share my gain with thee So shalt thou make five
dinars a day and be my slavey and I will protect thee against thy master
with this staff Quoth AlRashid I will well and quoth Khalifah
Then get off thy sheass and tie her up so she may serve us to carry
the fish hereafter and come hither that I may teach thee to fish
forthright So AlRashid alighted and hobbling his mule tucked his
skirts into his girdle and Khalifah said to him O piper lay hold of
the net thus and put it over thy forearm thus and cast it into the
Tigris thus Accordingly the Caliph took heart of grace and doing as
the fisherman showed him threw the net and pulled at it but could not
draw it up So Khalifah came to his aid and tugged at it with him but
the two together could not hale it up whereupon said the fisherman O
piper of illomen for the first time I took thy gown in place of my
clothes but this second time I will have thine ass and will beat thee
to boot till thou bepiss and beskite thyself An I find my net torn
Quoth AlRashid Let the twain of us pull at once So they both pulled
together and succeeded with difficulty in hauling that net ashore when
they found it full of fish of all kinds and coloursAnd Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say


       Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Thirtyeighth Night

She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Khalifah
the Fisherman and the Caliph hauled that net ashore they found it full
of fish of all kinds and Khalifah said to AlRashid By Allah O
piper thou art foul of favour but an thou apply thyself to fishing
thou wilt make a mighty fine fisherman But now twere best thou
bestraddle thine ass and make for the market and fetch me a pair of
frails and I will look after the fish till thou return when I and
thou will load it on thine asss back I have scales and weights and all
we want so we can take them with us and thou wilt have nothing to do
but to hold the scales and pouch the price for here we have fish worth
twenty dinars So be fast with the frails and loiter not Answered the
Caliph I hear and obey and mounting left him with his fish and
spurred his mule in high good humour and ceased not laughing over his
adventure with the Fisherman till he came up to Jaafar who said to
him O Commander of the Faithful belike when thou wentest down to
drink thou foundest a pleasant flowergarden and enteredst and tookest
thy pleasure therein alone At this AlRashid fell a laughing again and
all the Barmecides rose and kissed the ground before him saying O
Commander of the Faithful Allah make joy to endure for thee and do away
annoy from thee What was the cause of thy delaying when thou faredst to
drink and what hath befallen thee Quoth the Caliph Verily a right
wondrous tale and a joyous adventure and a wondrous hath befallen me
And he repeated to them what had passed between himself and the
Fisherman and his words Thou stolest my clothes and how he had given
him his gown and how he had cut off a part of it finding it too long
for him Said Jaafar By Allah O Commander of the Faithful I had it
in mind to beg the gown of thee but now I will go straight to the
Fisherman and buy it of him The Caliph replied By Allah he hath cut
off a third part of the skirt and spoilt it But O Jaafar I am tired
with fishing in the river for I have caught great store of fish which I
left on the bank with my master Khalifah and he is watching them and
waiting for me to return to him with a couple of frails and a
matchet Then we are to go I and he to the market and sell the
fish and share the price Jaafar rejoined O Commander of the
Faithful I will bring you a purchaser for your fish And AlRashid
retorted O Jaafar by the virtue of my holy forefathers whoso
bringeth me one of the fish that are before Khalifah who taught me
angling I will give him for it a gold dinar So the crier proclaimed
among the troops that they should go forth and buy fish for the Caliph
and they all arose and made for the riverside Now while Khalifah was
expecting the Caliphs return with the two frails behold the Mamelukes
swooped down upon him like vultures and took the fish and wrapped them
in goldembroidered kerchiefs beating one another in their eagerness to
get at the Fisherman Whereupon quoth Khalifah Doubtless these are of
the fish of Paradise and hending two fish in right hand and left
plunged into the water up to his neck and fell asaying O Allah by
the virtue of these fish let Thy servant the piper my partner come to
me at this very moment And suddenly up to him came a black slave which
was the chief of the Caliphs negro eunuchs He had tarried behind the
rest by reason of his horse having stopped to make water by the way
and finding that naught remained of the fish little or much looked
right and left till he espied Khalifah standing in the stream with a
fish in either hand and said to him Come hither O Fisherman But
Khalifah replied Begone and none of your impudence So the
eunuch went up to him and said Give me the fish and I will pay thee
their price Replied the Fisherman Art thou little of wit I will not
sell them Therewith the eunuch drew his mace upon him and Khalifah
cried out saying Strike not O loon Better largesse than the
mace So saying he threw the two fishes to the eunuch who took
them and laid them in his kerchief Then he put hand in pouch but found
not a single dirham and said to Khalifah O Fisherman verily thou art
out of luck for by Allah I have not a silver about me But come
tomorrow to the Palace of the Caliphate and ask for the eunuch Sandal
whereupon the castratos will direct thee to me and by coming thither
thou shalt get what falleth to thy lot and therewith wend thy ways
Quoth Khalifah Indeed this is a blessed day and its blessedness was
manifest from the first of it Then he shouldered his net and
returned to Baghdad and as he passed through the streets the folk saw
the Caliphs gown on him and stared at him till he came to the gate of
his quarter by which was the shop of the Caliphs tailor When the man
saw him wearing a dress of the apparel of the Caliph worth a thousand
dinars he said to him O Khalifah whence hadst thou that gown
Replied the Fisherman What aileth thee to be impudent I had it of one
whom I taught to fish and who is become my apprentice I forgave him the
cutting off of his hand for that he stole my clothes and gave me
this cape in their place So the tailor knew that the Caliph had come
upon him as he was fishing and jested with him and given him the
gownAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her
permitted say


       Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Thirtyninth Night

She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Caliph came
upon Khalifah the Fisherman and gave him his own gown in jest wherewith
the man fared home Such was his case but as regards Harun alRashid
he had gone out ahunting and afishing only to divert his thoughts from
the damsel Kut alKulub But when Zubaydah heard of her and of the
Caliphs devotion to her the Lady was fired with the jealousy which the
more especially fireth women so that she refused meat and drink and
rejected the delights of sleep and awaited the Caliphs going forth on a
journey or what not that she might set a snare for the damsel So when
she learnt that he was gone hunting and fishing she bade her women
furnish the Palace fairly and decorate it splendidly and serve up viands
and confections and amongst the rest she made a China dish of the
daintiest sweetmeats that can be made wherein she had put Bhang Then
she ordered one of her eunuchs go to the damsel Kut alKulub and bid her
to the banquet saying The Lady Zubaydah bint AlKasim the wife of
the Commander of the Faithful hath drunken medicine today and having
heard tell of the sweetness of thy singing longeth to divert herself
with somewhat of thine art Kut alKulub replied Hearing and
obedience are due to Allah and the Lady Zubaydah and rose without stay
or delay unknowing what was hidden for her in the Secret Purpose Then
she took with her what instruments she needed and accompanying the
eunuch ceased not faring till she stood in the presence of the
Princess When she entered she kissed ground before her again and again
then rising to her feet said Peace be on the Lady of the exalted seat
and the presence whereto none may avail daughter of the house Abbs
and scion of the Prophets family May Allah fulfil thee of peace and
prosperity in the days and the years Then she stood with the rest
of the women and eunuchs and presently the Lady Zubaydah raised her
eyes and considered her beauty and loveliness She saw a damsel with
cheeks smooth as rose and breasts like granado a face moonbright a
brow flowerwhite and great eyes black as night her eyelids were
langourdight and her face beamed with light as if the sun from her
forehead arose and the murks of the night from the locks of her brow
and the fragrance of musk from her breath strayed and flowers bloomed in
her lovely face inlaid the moon beamed from her forehead and in her
slender shape the branches swayed She was like the full moon shining in
the nightly shade her eyes wantoned her eyebrows were like a bow
arched and her lips of coral moulded Her beauty amazed all who espied
her and her glances amated all who eyed her Glory be to Him who formed
her and fashioned her and perfected her Brief she was even as saith
the poet of one who favoured her

 When shes incensed thou seest folk lie slain  And when shes pleased
    their souls are quick again
 Her eyne are armed with glances magical  Wherewith she kills and
    quickens as shes fain
 The Worlds she leadeth captive with her eyes  As tho the Worlds were
    all her slavish train

Quoth the Lady Zubaydah Well come and welcome and fair cheer to thee
O Kut alKulub Sit and divert us with thine art and the goodliness of
thine accomplishments Quoth the damsel I hear and I obey and
putting out her hand took the tambourine whereof one of its praisers
speaketh in the following verses

 Ho thou o the tabret my heart takes flight  And lovesmit cries while
    thy fingers smite
 Thou takest naught but a wounded heart  The while for acceptance longs
    the wight
 So say thou word or heavy or light  Play whateer thou please it will
    charm the sprite
 Sois bonne unveil thy cheek ma belle  Rise deftly dance and all
    hearts delight

Then she smote the tambourine briskly and so sang thereto that she
stopped the birds in the sky and the place danced with them blithely
after which she laid down the tambourine and took the pipe whereof
it is said

 She hath eyes whose babes wi their fingers sign  To sweet tunes
    without a discordant line

And as the poet also said in this couplet

 And when she announceth the will to sing  For Unionjoy tis a time
    divine

Then she laid down the pipe after she had charmed therewith all who
were present and took up the lute whereof saith the poet

 How many a blooming bough in gleegirls hand is fain  As lute to
    witch great souls by charm of cunning strain
 She sweeps tormenting lute strings by her artful touch  Wi fingertips
    that surely chain with endless chain

Then she tightened its pegs and tuned its strings and laying it in her
lap bended over it as mother bendeth over child and it seemed as it
were of her and her lute that the poet spoke in these couplets

 Sweetly discourses she on Persian string  And Unintelligence makes
    understand
 And teaches she that Loves a murtherer  Who oft the reasoning Moslem
    hath unmannd

 A maid by Allah in whose palm a thing  Of painted wood like mouth can
    speech command
 With lute she stauncheth flow of Love and so  Stops flow of blood the
    cunning leachs hand

Then she preluded in fourteen different modes and sang to the lute an
entire piece so as to confound the gazers and delight her hearers
After which she recited these two couplets

   The coming unto thee is blest  Therein new joys for aye attend
   Its blisses are continuous  Its blessings never never end

And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her
permitted say


         Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Fortieth Night

She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the maiden Kut
alKulub after singing these songs and sweeping the strings in presence
of the Lady Zubaydah rose and exhibited tricks of sleight of hand and
legerdemain and all manner pleasing arts till the Princess came near to
fall in love with her and said to herself Verily my cousin AlRashid
is not to blame for loving her Then the damsel kissed ground before
Zubaydah and sat down whereupon they set food before her Presently
they brought her the drugged dish of sweetmeats and she ate thereof and
hardly had it settled in her stomach when her head fell backward and she
sank on the ground sleeping With this the Lady said to her women
Carry her up to one of the chambers till I summon her and they
replied We hear and we obey Then said she to one of her eunuchs
Fashion me a chest and bring it hitherto to me and shortly
afterwards she bade make the semblance of a tomb and spread the report
that Kut alKulub had choked and died threatening her familiars that
she would smite the neck of whoever should say She is alive Now
behold the Caliph suddenly returned from the chase and the first
enquiry he made was for the damsel So there came to him one of his
eunuchs whom the Lady Zubaydah had charged to declare she was dead if
the Caliph should ask for her and kissing ground before him said May
thy head live O my lord Be certified that Kut alKulub choked in
eating and is dead Whereupon cried AlRashid God never gladden thee
with good news O thou bad slave and entered the Palace where he
heard of her death from every one and asked Where is her tomb So
they brought him to the sepulchre and showed him the pretended tomb
saying This is her burialplace When he saw it he cried out and
wept and embraced it quoting these two couplets

 By Allah O tomb have her beauties ceased and disappeared from sight
    And is the countenance changed and wan that shone so wonderbright
 O tomb O tomb thou art neither heaven nor garden verily How comes it
    then that swaying branch and moon in thee unite

The Caliph weeping sore for her abode by the tomb a full hour after
which he arose and went away in the utmost distress and the deepest
melancholy So the Lady Zubaydah saw that her plot had succeeded and
forthright sent for the eunuch and said Hither with the chest He set
it before her when she bade bring the damsel and locking her up therein
said to the Eunuch Take all pains to sell this chest and make it a
condition with the purchaser that he buy it locked then give alms with
its price So he took it and went forth to do her bidding Thus
fared it with these but as for Khalifah the Fisherman when morning
morrowed and shone with its light and sheen he said to himself I
cannot do aught better today than visit the Eunuch who bought the fish
of me for he appointed me to come to him in the Palace of the
Caliphate So he went forth of his lodging intending for the palace
and when he came thither he found Mamelukes negroslaves and eunuchs
standing and sitting and looking at them behold seated amongst them
was the Eunuch who had taken the fish of him with the white slaves
waiting on him Presently one of the Mamelukelads called out to him
whereupon the Eunuch turned to see who he was an lo it was the
Fisherman Now when Khalifah was ware that he saw him and recognised
him he said to him I have not failed thee O my little Tulip On
this wise are men of their word Hearing his address Sandal the
Eunuch laughed and replied By Allah thou art right O
Fisherman and put his hand to his pouch to give him somewhat but at
that moment there arose a great clamour So he raised his head to see
what was to do and finding that it was the Wazir Jaafar the Barmecide
coming forth from the Caliphs presence he rose to him and forewent
him and they walked about conversing for a longsome time Khalifah the
Fisherman waited awhile then growing weary of standing and finding
that the Eunuch took no heed of him he set himself in his way and
beckoned to him from afar saying O my lord Tulip give me my due and
let me go The Eunuch heard him but was ashamed to answer him because
of the Ministers presence so he went on talking with Jaafar and took
no notice whatever of the Fisherman Whereupon quoth Khalifah O Slow
o Pay May Allah put to shame all churls and all who take folkss
goods and are niggardly with them I put myself under thy protection O
my lord Branbelly to give me my due and let me go The Eunuch
heard him but was ashamed to answer him before Jaafar and the
Minister saw the Fisherman beckoning and talking to him though he knew
not what he was saying so he said to Sandal misliking his behaviour
O Eunuch what would yonder beggar with thee Sandal replied Dost
thou not know him O my lord the Wazir and Jaafar answered By
Allah I know him not How should I know a man I have never seen but at
this moment Rejoined the Eunuch O my lord this is the Fisherman
whose fish we seized on the banks of the Tigris I came too late to get
any and was ashamed to return to the Prince of True Believers
emptyhanded when all the Mamelukes had some Presently I espied the
Fisherman standing in midstream calling on Allah with four fishes in
his hands and said to himGive me what thou hast there and take their
worth He handed me the fish and I put my hand into my pocket purposing
to gift him with somewhat but found naught therein and saidCome to me
in the Palace and I will give thee wherewithal to aid thee in thy
poverty So he came to me today and I was putting hand to pouch that I
might give him somewhat when thou camest forth and I rose to wait on
thee and was diverted with thee from him till he grew tired of waiting
and this is the whole story how he cometh to be standing hereAnd
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say


        Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Fortyfirst Night

She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Sandal
the Eunuch related to Jaafar the Barmecide the tale of Khalifah the
Fisherman ending with This is the whole story and how he cometh to be
standing here the Wazir hearing this account smiled and said O
Eunuch how is it that this Fisherman cometh in his hour of need and
thou satisfiest him not Dost thou not know him O Chief of the
Eunuchs No answered Sandal and Jaafar said This is the Master of
the Commander of the Faithful and his partner and our lord the Caliph
hath arisen this morning strait of breast heavy of heart and troubled
in thought nor is there aught will broaden his breast save this
fisherman So let him not go till I crave the Caliphs pleasure
concerning him and bring him before him perchance Allah will relieve
him of his oppression and console him for the loss of Kut alKulub by
means of the Fishermans presence and he will give him wherewithal to
better himself and thou wilt be the cause of this Replied Sandal O
my lord do as thou wilt and may Allah Almighty long continue thee a
pillar of the dynasty of the Commander of the Faithful whose shadow
Allah perpetuate and prosper it root and branch Then the Wazir
Jaafar rose up and went in to the Caliph and Sandal ordered the
Mamelukes not to leave the Fisherman whereupon Khalifah cried How
goodly is thy bounty O Tulip The seeker is become the sought I come
to seek my due and they imprison me for debts in arrears When
Jaafar came in to the presence of the Caliph he found him sitting with
his head bowed earthwards breast straitened and mind melancholy
humming the verses of the poet

 My blamers instant bid that I for her become consoled  But I what can
    I do whose heart declines to be controlled
 And how can I in patience bear the loss of lovely maid  When fails me
    patience for a love that holds with firmest hold
 Neer Ill forget her nor the bowl that twixt us both went round  And
    wine of glances maddened me with drunkenness ensould

Whenas Jaafar stood in the presence he said Peace be upon thee O
Commander of the Faithful Defender of the honour of the Faith and
descendant of the uncle of the Prince of the Apostles Allah assain him
and save him and his family one and all The Caliph raised his head and
answered And on thee be peace and the mercy of Allah and His
blessings Quoth Jaafar With leave of the Prince of True Believers
his servant would speak without restraint Asked the Caliph And when
was restraint put upon thee in speech and thou the Prince of Wazirs Say
what thou wilt Answered Jaafar When I went out O my lord from
before thee intending for my house I saw standing at the door thy
master and teacher and partner Khalifah the Fisherman who was
aggrieved at thee and complained of thee sayingGlory be to God I
taught him to fish and he went away to fetch me a pair of frails but
never came back and this is not the way of a good partner or of a good
apprentice So if thou hast a mind to partnership well and good and
if not tell him that he may take to partner another Now when the
Caliph heard these words he smiled and his straitness of breast was done
away with and he said My life on thee is this the truth thou sayest
that the Fisherman standeth at the door and Jaafar replied By thy
life O Commander of the Faithful he standeth at the door Quoth the
Caliph O Jaafar by Allah I will assuredly do my best to give him
his due If Allah at my hands send him misery he shall have it and if
prosperity he shall have it Then he took a piece of paper and cutting
it in pieces said to the Wazir O Jaafar write down with thine own
hand twenty sums of money from one dinar to a thousand and the names
of all kinds of offices and dignities from the least appointment to the
Caliphate also twenty kinds of punishment from the lightest beating to
death I hear and I obey O Commander of the Faithful answered
Jaafar and did as he was bidden Then said the Caliph O Jaafar I
swear by my holy forefathers and by my kinship to Hamzah and
Akl that I mean to summon the fisherman and bid him take one of
these papers whose contents none knoweth save thou and I and
whatsoever is written in the paper which he shall choose I will give it
to him though it be the Caliphate I will divest myself thereof and
invest him therewith and grudge it not to him and on the other hand
if there be written therein hanging or mutilation or death I will
execute it upon him Now go and fetch him to me When Jaafar heard
this he said to himself There is no Majesty and there is no Might
save in Allah the Glorious the Great It may be somewhat will fall to
this poor wretchs lot that will bring about his destruction and I
shall be the cause But the Caliph hath sworn so nothing remains now
but to bring him in and naught will happen save whatso Allah willeth
Accordingly he went out to Khalifah the Fisherman and laid hold of his
hand to carry him in to the Caliph whereupon his reason fled and he
said in himself What a stupid I was to come after yonder illomened
slave Tulip whereby he hath brought me in company with Branbelly
Jaafar fared on with him with Mamelukes before and behind whilst he
said Doth not arrest suffice but these must go behind and before me
to hinder my making off till they had traversed seven vestibules when
the Wazir said to him Mark my words O Fisherman Thou standest before
the Commander of the Faithful and Defender of the Faith Then he raised
the great curtain and Khalifahs eyes fell on the Caliph who was seated
on his couch with the Lords of the realm standing in attendance upon
him As soon as he knew him he went up to him and said Well come and
welcome to thee O piper Twas not right of thee to make thyself a
Fisherman and go away leaving me sitting to guard the fish and never
to return For before I was aware there came up Mamelukes on beasts of
all manner colours and snatched away the fish from me I standing
alone and this was all of thy fault for hadst thou returned with the
frails forthright we had sold an hundred dinars worth of fish And now
I come to seek my due and they have arrested me But thou who hath
imprisoned thee also in this place The Caliph smiled and raising a
corner of the curtain put forth his head and said to the Fisherman
Come hither and take thee one of these papers Quoth Khalifah the
Fisherman Yesterday thou wast a fisherman and today thou hast become
an astrologer but the more trades a man hath the poorer he waxeth
Thereupon Jaafar said Take the paper at once and do as the
Commander of the Faithful biddeth thee without prating So he came
forward and put forth his hand saying Far be it from me that this
piper should ever again be my knave and fish with me Then taking the
paper he handed it to the Caliph saying O piper what hath come out
for me therein Hide naught thereofAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn
of day and ceased to say her permitted say


       Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Fortysecond Night

She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Khalifah
the Fisherman took up one of the papers and handed it to the Caliph he
said O piper what have come out to me therein Hide naught thereof
So AlRashid received it and passed it on to Jaafar and said to him
Read what is therein He looked at it and said There is no Majesty
there is no Might save in Allah the Glorious the Great Said the
Caliph Good news O Jaafar What seest thou therein Answered
the Wazir O Commander of the Faithful there came up from the
paperLet the Fisherman receive an hundred blows with a stick So the
Caliph commanded to beat the Fisherman and they gave him an hundred
sticks after which he rose saying Allah damn this O Branbelly Are
jail and sticks part of the game Then said Jaafar O Commander of
the Faithful this poor devil is come to the river and how shall he go
away thirsting We hope that among the almsdeeds of the Commander of
the Faithful he may have leave to take another paper so haply somewhat
may come out wherewithal he may succour his poverty Said the Caliph
By Allah O Jaafar if he take another paper and death be written
therein I will assuredly kill him and thou wilt be the cause
Answered Jaafar If he die he will be at rest But Khalifah the
Fisherman said to him Allah neer gladden thee with good news Have I
made Baghdad strait upon you that ye seek to slay me Quoth Jaafar
Take thee a paper and crave the blessing of Allah Almighty So he put
out his hand and taking a paper gave it to Jaafar who read it and was
silent The Caliph asked Why art thou silent O son of Yahya and he
answered O Commander of the Faithful there hath come out on this
paperNaught shall be given to the Fisherman Then said the Caliph
His daily bread will not come from us bid him fare forth from before
our face Quoth Jaafar By the claims of thy pious forefathers let
him take a third paper it may be it will bring him alimony and quoth
the Caliph Let him take one and no more So he put out his hand and
took a third paper and behold therein was written Let the Fisherman
be given one dinar Jaafar cried to him I sought good fortune for
thee but Allah willed not to thee aught save this dinar And Khalifah
answered Verily a dinar for every hundred sticks were rare good luck
may Allah not send thy body health The Caliph laughed at him and
Jaafar took him by the hand and led him out When he reached the door
Sandal the eunuch saw him and said to him Hither O Fisherman Give us
portion of that which the Commander of the Faithful hath bestowed on
thee whilst jesting with thee Replied Khalifah By Allah O Tulip
thou art right Wilt thou share with me O nigger Indeed I have eaten
stick to the tune of an hundred blows and have earned one dinar and
thou art but too welcome to it So saying he threw him the dinar and
went out with the tears flowing down the plain of his cheeks When the
Eunuch saw him in this plight he knew that he had spoken sooth and
called to the lads to fetch him back so they brought him back and
Sandal putting his hand to his pouch pulled out a red purse whence he
emptied an hundred golden dinars into the Fishermans hand saying
Take this gold in payment of thy fish and wend thy ways So Khalifah
in high good humour took the hundred ducats and the Caliphs one dinar
and went his way and forgot the beating Now as Allah willed it for
the furthering of that which He had decreed he passed by the mart of
the handmaidens and seeing there a mighty ring where many folks were
forgathering said to himself What is this crowd So he brake through
the merchants and others who said Make wide the way for Skipper
Rapscallion and let him pass Then he looked and behold he saw a
chest with an eunuch seated thereon and an old man standing by it and
the Shaykh was crying O merchants O men of money who will hasten and
hazard his coin for this chest of unknown contents from the Palace of
the Lady Zubaydah bint alKasim wife of the Commander of the Faithful
How much shall I say for you Allah bless you all Quoth one of the
merchants By Allah this is a risk But I will say one word and no
blame to me Be it mine for twenty dinars Quoth another Fifty and
they went on bidding one against other till the price reached an
hundred ducats Then said the crier Will any of you bid more O
merchants And Khalifah the Fisherman said Be it mine for an hundred
dinars and one dinar The merchants hearing these words thought he
was jesting and laughed at him saying O eunuch sell it to Khalifah
for an hundred dinars and one dinar Quoth the eunuch By Allah I
will sell it to none but him Take it O Fisherman the Lord bless thee
in it and here with thy gold So Khalifah pulled out the ducats and
gave them to the eunuch who the bargain being duly made delivered to
him the chest and bestowed the price in alms on the spot after which he
returned to the Palace and acquainted the Lady Zubaydah with what he had
done whereat she rejoiced Meanwhile the Fisherman hove the chest on
shoulder but could not carry it on this wise for the excess of its
weight so he lifted it on to his head and thus bore it to the quarter
where he lived Here he set it down and being weary sat awhile
bemusing what had befallen him and saying in himself Would Heaven I
knew what is in this chest Then he opened the door of his lodging and
haled the chest till he got it into his closet after which he strove to
open it but failed Quoth he What folly possessed me to buy this
chest There is no help for it but to break it open and see what is
herein So he applied himself to the lock but could not open it and
said to himself I will leave it till tomorrow Then he would have
stretched him out to sleep but could find no room for the chest filled
the whole closet So he got upon it and lay him down but when he had
lain awhile behold he felt something stir under him whereat sleep
forsook him and his reason fledAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of
day and ceased saying her permitted say


        Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Fortythird Night

She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Khalifah
the Fisherman lay down upon the chest and thus tarried awhile behold
something stirred beneath him whereat he was affrighted and his reason
fled So he arose and cried Meseems there be Jinns in the chest
Praise to Allah who suffered me not to open it For had I done so they
had risen against me in the dark and slain me and from them would have
befallen me naught of good Then he lay down again when lo the chest
moved a second time more than before whereupon he sprang to his feet
and said There it goes again but this is terrible And he hastened
to look for the lamp but could not find it and had not the wherewithal
to buy another So he went forth and cried out Ho people of the
quarter Now the most part of the folk were asleep but they awoke at
his crying and asked What aileth thee O Khalifah He answered
Bring me a lamp for the Jinn are upon me They laughed at him and
gave him a lamp wherewith he returned to his closet Then he smote the
lock of the chest with a stone and broke it and opening it saw a damsel
like a Houri lying asleep within Now she had been drugged with Bhang
but at that moment she threw up the stuff and awoke then she opened her
eyes and feeling herself confined and cramped moved At this sight
quoth Khalifah By Allah O my lady whence art thou and quoth she
Bring me Jessamine and Narcissus And Khalifah answered There
is naught here but Hennaflowers Thereupon she came to herself
and considering Khalifah said to him What art thou presently
adding And where am I He said Thou art in my lodging Asked she
Am I not in the Palace of the Caliph Harun alRashid And quoth he
What manner of thing is AlRashid O madwoman Thou are naught but
my slavegirl I bought thee this very day for an hundred dinars and one
dinar and brought thee home and thou wast asleep in this here chest
When she heard these words she said to him What is thy name Said he
My name is Khalifah How comes my star to have grown propitious when I
know my ascendant to have been otherwise She laughed and cried Spare
me this talk Hast thou anything to eat Replied he No by Allah nor
yet to drink I have not eaten these two days and am now in want of a
morsel She asked Hast thou no money and he said Allah keep this
chest which hath beggared me I gave all I had for it and am become
bankrupt The damsel laughed at him and said Up with thee and seek of
thy neighbours somewhat for me to eat for I am hungry So he went
forth and cried out Ho people of the quarter Now the folk were
asleep but they awoke and asked What aileth thee O Khalifah
Answered He O my neighbours I am hungry and have nothing to eat So
one came down to him with a bannock and another with broken meats and a
third with a bittock of cheese and a fourth with a cucumber and so on
till his lap was full and he returned to his closet and laid the whole
between her hands saying Eat But she laughed at him saying How
can I eat of this when I have not a mug of water whereof to drink I
fear to choke with a mouthful and die Quoth he I will fill thee this
pitcher So he took the pitcher and going forth stood in the
midst of the street and cried out saying Ho people of the quarter
Quoth they What calamity is upon thee tonight O Khalifah And
he said Ye gave me food and I ate but now I am athirst so give me to
drink Thereupon one came down to him with a mug and another with an
ewer and a third with a gugglet and he filled his pitcher and bearing
it back said to the damsel O my lady thou lackest nothing now
Answered she True I want nothing more at this present Quoth he
Speak to me and say me thy story And quoth she Fie upon thee An
thou knowest me not I will tell thee who I am I am Kut alKulub the
Caliphs handmaiden and the Lady Zubaydah was jealous of me so she
drugged me with Bhang and set me in this chest presently adding
Alhamdolillahpraised be Godfor that the matter hath come to easy
issue and no worse But this befel me not save for thy good luck for
thou wilt certainly get of the Caliph AlRashid money galore that will
be the means of thine enrichment Quoth Khalifah Is not AlRashid he
in whose Palace I was imprisoned Yes answered she and he said By
Allah never saw I more niggardly wight than he that piper little of
good and wit He gave me an hundred blows with a stick yesterday and but
one dinar for all I taught him to fish and made him my partner but he
played me false Replied she Leave this unseemly talk and open thine
eyes and look thou bear thyself respectfully whenas thou seest him
after this and thou shalt win thy wish When he heard her words it
was if he had been asleep and awoke and Allah removed the veil from his
judgment because of his good luck and he answered On my head
and eyes Then said he to her Sleep in the name of Allah So
she lay down and fell asleep and he afar from her till the morning
when she sought of him inkcase and paper and when they were
brought wrote to Ibn alKirnas the Caliphs friend acquainting him
with her case and how at the end of all that had befallen her she was
with Khalifah the Fisherman who had bought her Then she gave him the
scroll saying Take this and hie thee to the jewelmarket and ask for
the shop of Ibn alKirnas the Jeweller and give him this paper and speak
not I hear and I obey answered Khalifah and going with the scroll
to the market enquired for the shop of Ibn alKirnas They directed him
thither and on entering it he saluted the merchant who returned his
salam with contempt and said to him What dost thou want Thereupon he
gave him the letter and he took it but read it not thinking the
Fisherman a beggar who sought an alms of him and said to one of his
lads Give him half a dirham Quoth Khalifah I want no alms read
the paper So Ibn alKirnas took the letter and read it and no sooner
knew its import than he kissed it and laying it on his headAnd
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say


       Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Fortyfourth Night

She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Ibn
alKirnas read the letter and knew its import he kissed it and laid it
on his head then he arose and said to Khalifah O my brother where is
thy house Asked Khalifah What wantest thou with my house Wilt thou
go thither and steal my slavegirl Then Ibn alKirnas answered Not
so on the contrary I will buy thee somewhat whereof you may eat thou
and she So he said My house is in such a quarter and the merchant
rejoined Thou hast done well May Allah not give thee health O
unlucky one Then he called out to two of his slaves and said to
them Carry this man to the shop of Mohsin the Shroff and say to him
O Mohsin give this man a thousand dinars of gold then bring him back
to me in haste So they carried him to the moneychanger who paid him
the money and returned with him to their master whom they found
mounted on a dapple shemule worth a thousand dinars with Mamelukes and
pages about him and by his side another mule like his own saddled and
bridled Quoth the jeweller to Khalifah Bismillah mount this mule
Replied he I wont for by Allah I fear she throw me and quoth Ibn
alKirnas By God needs must thou mount So he came up and mounting
her face to crupper caught hold of her tail and cried out whereupon
she threw him on the ground and they laughed at him but he rose and
said Did I not tell thee I would not mount this great jennyass
Thereupon Ibn alKirnas left him in the market and repairing to the
Caliph told him of the damsel after which he returned and removed her
to his own house Meanwhile Khalifah went home to look after the
handmaid and found the people of the quarter foregathering and saying
Verily Khalifah is today in a terrible pickle Would we knew
whence he can have gotten this damsel Quoth one of them He is a mad
pimp haply he found her lying on the road drunken and carried her to
his own house and his absence showeth that he knoweth his offence As
they were talking behold up came Khalifah and they said to him What
a plight is thine O unhappy knowest thou not what is come to thee He
replied No by Allah and they said But just now there came
Mamelukes and took away thy slavegirl whom thou stolest and sought for
thee but found thee not Asked Khalifah And how came they to take my
slavegirl and quoth one Had he fallen in their way they had slain
him But he so far from heeding them returned running to the shop of
Ibn alKirnas whom he met riding and said to him By Allah twas not
right of thee to wheedle me and meanwhile send thy Mamelukes to take my
slavegirl Replied the jeweller O idiot come with me and hold thy
tongue So he took him and carried him into a house handsomely builded
where he found the damsel seated on a couch of gold with ten
slavegirls like moons round her Sighting her Ibn alKirnas kissed
ground before her and she said What hast thou done with my new master
who bought me with all he owned He replied O my lady I gave him a
thousand golden dinars and related to her Khalifahs history from
first to last whereat she laughed and said Blame him not for he is
but a common wight These other thousand dinars are a gift from me to
him and Almighty Allah willing he shall win of the Caliph what shall
enrich him As they were talking there came an eunuch from the
Commander of the Faithful in quest of Kut alKulub for when he knew
that she was in the house of Ibn alKirnas he could not endure the
severance but bade bring her forthwith So she repaired to the Palace
taking Khalifah with her and going into the presence kissed ground
before the Caliph who rose to her saluting and welcoming her and
asked her how she had fared with him who had bought her She replied
He is a man Khalifah the Fisherman hight and there he standeth at the
door He telleth me that he hath an account to settle with the Commander
of the Faithful by reason of a partnership between him and the Caliph
in fishing Asked AlRashid Is he at the door and she answered
Yes So the Caliph sent for him and he kissed ground before him and
wished him endurance of glory and prosperity The Caliph marvelled at
him and laughed at him and said to him O Fisherman wast thou in very
deed my partner yesterday Khalifah took his meaning and
heartening his heart and summoning spirit replied By Him who bestowed
upon thee the succession to thy cousin I know her not in anywise
and have had no commerce with her save by way of sight and speech Then
he repeated to him all that had befallen him since he last saw
him whereat the Caliph laughed and his breast broadened and he
said to Khalifah Ask of us what thou wilt O thou who bringest to
owners their own But he was silent so the Caliph ordered him fifty
thousand dinars of gold and a costly dress of honour such as great
Sovrans don and a shemule and gave him black slaves of the Sdn to
serve him so that he became as he were one of the Kings of that time
The Caliph was rejoiced at the recovery of his favourite and knew that
all this was the doing of his cousinwife the Lady ZubaydahAnd
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say


        Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Fortyfifth Night

She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Caliph
rejoiced at the recovery of Kut alKulub and knew that all this was the
doing of the Lady Zubaydah his cousinwife wherefore he was sore
enraged against her and held aloof from her a great while visiting her
not neither inclining to pardon her When she was certified of this she
was sore concerned for his wrath and her face that was wont to be rosy
waxed pale and wan till when her patience was exhausted she sent a
letter to her cousin the Commander of the Faithful making her excuses
to him and confessing her offences and ending with these verses

 I long once more the love that was between us to regain  That I may
    quench the fire of grief and bate the force of bane

 O lords of me have ruth upon the stress my passion deals  Enough to me
    is what you doled of sorrow and of pain
 Tis life to me an deign you keep the troth you deigned to plight  Tis
    death to me an troth you break and fondest vows profane
 Given Ive sinned a sorry sin yet grant me ruth for naught  By Allah
    sweeter is than friend who is of pardon fain

When the Lady Zubaydahs letter reached the Caliph and reading it he
saw that she confessed her offence and sent her excuses to him therefor
he said to himself Verily all sins doth Allah forgive aye Gracious
Merciful is He And he returned her an answer expressing
satisfaction and pardon and forgiveness for what was past whereat she
rejoiced greatly As for Khalifah the Fisherman the Caliph assigned
him a monthly solde of fifty dinars and took him into especial favour
which would lead to rank and dignity honour and worship Then he kissed
ground before the Commander of the Faithful and went forth with stately
gait When he came to the door the Eunuch Sandal who had given him the
hundred dinars saw him and knowing him said to him O Fisherman
whence all this So he told him all that had befallen him first and
last whereat Sandal rejoiced because he had been the cause of his
enrichment and said to him Wilt thou not give me largesse of this
wealth which is now become thine So Khalifah put hand to pouch and
taking out a purse containing a thousand dinars gave it to the Eunuch
who said Keep thy coins and Allah bless thee therein and marvelled
at his manliness and at the liberality of his soul for all his late
poverty Then leaving the eunuch Khalifah mounted his shemule and
rode with the slaves hands on her crupper till he came to his lodging
at the Khan whilst the folk stared at him in surprise for that which
had betided him of advancement When he alighted from his beast they
accosted him and enquired the cause of his change from poverty to
prosperity and he told them all that had happened to him from incept to
conclusion Then he bought a fine mansion and laid out thereon much
money till it was perfect in all points And he took up his abode
therein and was wont to recite thereon these two couplets

 Behold a house thats like the Dwelling of Delight  Its aspect
    heals the sick and banishes despite
 Its sojourn for the great and wise appointed is  And Fortune fair
    therein abideth day and night

Then as soon as he was settled in his house he sought him in marriage
the daughter of one of the chief men of the city a handsome girl and
went in unto her and led a life of solace and satisfaction joyaunce and
enjoyment and he rose to passing affluence and exceeding prosperity
So when he found himself in this fortunate condition he offered up
thanks to Allah extolled and excelled be He for what He had bestowed
on him of wealth exceeding and of favours ever succeeding praising his
Lord with the praise of the grateful and chanting the words of the
poet

 To Thee be praise O Thou who showest unremitting grace  O Thou whose
    universal bounties high and low embrace
 To Thee be praise from me Then deign accept my praise for I  Accept
    Thy boons and gifts with grateful soul in every case
 Thou hast with favours overwhelmed me benefits and largesse  And
    gracious doles my memory neer ceaseth to retrace
 All men from mighty main Thy grace and goodness drain and drink  And
    in their need Thou only Thou to them art refugeplace
 Thou heapest up O Lord Thy mercysigns on mortal men  Thou pardonest
    mans every sin though he be high or base
 So for the sake of him who came to teach mankind in ruth  Prophet
    pure truthfulworded scion of the noblest race
 Ever be Allahs blessing and His peace on him and all  His aids
    and kin while pilgrims fare his noble tomb to face
 And on his helpmeets one and all Companions great and good 
    Through time Eternal while the bird shall sing in shady wood

And thereafter Khalifah continued to pay frequent visits to the Caliph
Harun alRashid with whom he found acceptance and who ceased not to
overwhelm him with boons and bounty and he abode in the enjoyment of
the utmost honour and happiness and joy and gladness and in riches more
than sufficing and in rank ever rising brief a sweet life and a
savoury pure as pleasurable till there came to him the Destroyer of
delights and the Sunderer of societies and extolled be the perfection
of Him to whom belong glory and permanence and He is the Living the
Eternal who shall never die

                    KHALIF THE FISHERMAN OF BAGHDAD


There was once in days of yore and in ages and times long gone before
in the city of Baghdad a fisherman by name Khalf a man of muckle
talk and little luck One day as he sat in his cell he bethought
himself and said There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in
Allah the Glorious the Great Would Heaven I knew what is my offence
in the sight of my Lord and what caused the blackness of my fortune and
my littleness of luck among the fishermen albeit and I say it who
should not in the city of Baghdad there is never a fisherman like
myself Now he lodged in a ruined place called a Khan to wit an
inn without a door and when he went forth to fish he would
shoulder the net without basket or fishslicers and when the folk
would stare at him and say to him O Khalif why not take with thee a
basket to hold the fish thou catchest he would reply Even as I
carry it forth empty so would it come back for I never manage to catch
aught One night he arose in the darkness before dawn and taking his
net on his shoulder raised his eyes to heaven and said Allah mine O
Thou who subjectedst the sea to Moses son of Imrn give me this day my
daily bread for Thou art the best of breadgivers Then he went down
to the Tigris and spreading his net cast it into the river and waited
till it had settled down when he haled it in and drew it ashore but
behold it held naught save a dead dog So he cast away the carcase
saying O morning of ill doom What a handsel is this dead hound after
I had rejoiced in its weight Then he mended the rents in the net
saying Needs must there after this carrion be fish in plenty
attracted by the smell and made a second cast After awhile he drew
up and found in the net the hough of a camel that had caught in
the meshes and rent them right and left When Khalif saw his net in this
state he wept and said There is no Majesty and there is no Might save
in Allah the Glorious the Great I wonder what is my offence and the
cause of the blackness of my fortune and the littleness of my luck of
all folk so that I catch neither catfish nor sprat that I may
broil on the embers and eat for all I dare say there is not in the city
of Baghdad a fisherman like me Then with a Bismillah he cast his net a
third time and presently drawing it ashore found therein an ape scurvy
and oneeyed mangy and limping hending an ivory rod in forehand When
Khalif saw this he said This is indeed a blessed opening What art
thou O ape Dost thou not know me No by Allah I have no
knowledge of thee I am thine ape What use is there in thee O my
ape Every day I give thee goodmorrow so Allah may not open to thee
the door of daily bread Thou failest not of this O oneeye of
illomen May Allah never bless thee Needs must I pluck out thy sound
eye and cut off thy whole leg so thou mayst become a blind cripple and
I be quit of thee But what is the use of that rod thou hendest in
hand O Khalif I scare the fish therewith so they may not enter thy
net Is it so then this very day will I punish thee with a grievous
punishment and devise thee all manner torments and strip thy flesh from
thy bones and be at rest from thee sorry bit of goods that thou art
So saying Khalif the Fisherman unwound from his middle a strand of rope
and binding him to a tree by his side said Lookee O dog of an ape I
mean to cast the net again and if aught come up therein well and good
but if it come up empty I will verily and assuredly make an end of
thee with the cruellest tortures and be quit of thee thou stinking
lot So he cast the net and drawing it ashore found in it another ape
and said Glory be to God the Great I was wont to pull naught but fish
out of this Tigris but now it yieldeth nothing but apes Then he
looked at the second ape and saw him fair of form and round of face with
pendants of gold in his ears and a blue waistcloth about his middle and
he was like unto a lighted taper So he asked him What art thou thou
also O ape and he answered saying O Khalif I am the ape of Ab
alSadt the Jew the Caliphs shroff Every day I give Him
goodmorrow and he maketh a profit of ten gold pieces Cried the
Fisherman By Allah thou art a fine ape not like this illomened
monkey o mine So saying he took a stick and came down upon the
sides of the ape till he broke his ribs and he jumped up and down And
the other ape the handsome one answered him saying O Khalif what
will it profit thee to beat him though thou belabour him till he die
Khalif replied How shall I do Shall I let him wend his ways that he
may scare me the fish with his hangdog face and give me goodeven and
goodmorrow every day so Allah may not open to me the door of daily
bread Nay I will kill him and be quit of him and I will take thee in
his stead so shalt thou give me goodmorrow and I shall gain ten golden
dinars a day Thereupon the comely ape made answer I will tell thee a
better way than that and if thou hearken to me thou shalt be at rest
and I will become thine ape in lieu of him Asked the Fisherman And
what dost thou counsel me and the ape answered saying Cast thy net
and thou shalt bring up a noble fish never saw any its like and I will
tell thee how thou shalt do with it Replied Khalif Lookee thou too
An I throw my net and there come up therein a third ape be assured that
I will cut the three of you into six bits And the second ape rejoined
So be it O Khalif I agree to this thy condition Then Khalif spread
the net and cast it and drew it up when behold in it was a fine young
barbel with a round head as it were a milkingpail which when he
saw his wits fled for joy and he said Glory be to God What is this
noble creature Were yonder apes in the river I had not brought up this
fish Quoth the seemly ape O Khalif an thou give ear to my rede
twill bring thee good fortune and quoth the Fisherman May God damn
him who would gainsay thee henceforth Thereupon the ape said O
Khalif take some grass and lay the fish thereon in the basket and
cover it with more grass and take also somewhat of basil from the
greengrocers and set it in the fishs mouth Cover it with a kerchief
and push thee through the bazar of Baghdad Whoever bespeaketh thee of
selling it sell it not but fare on till thou come to the market street
of the jewellers and moneychangers Then count five shops on the
righthand side and the sixth shop is that of Abu alSaadat the Jew
the Caliphs Shroff When thou standest before him he will say to thee
What seekest thou and do thou make answer I am a fisherwight I
threw my net in thy name and took this noble barbel which I have
brought thee as a present If he give thee aught of silver take it not
be it little or mickle for it will spoil that which thou wouldst do
but say to him I want of thee naught save one word that thou say to
me I sell thee my ape for thine ape and my luck for thy luck An the
Jew say this give him the fish and I shall become thine ape and this
crippled mangy and oneeyed ape will be his ape Khalif replied Well
said O ape nor did he cease faring Baghdadwards and observing that
which the ape had said to him till he came to the Jews shop and saw
the Shroff seated with eunuchs and pages about him bidding and
forbidding and giving and taking So he set down his basket saying O
Sultan of the Jews I am a fisherwight and went forth today to the
Tigris and casting my net in thy name criedThis is for the luck of
Abu alSaadat and there came up to me this Banni which I have brought
thee by way of present Then he lifted the grass and discovered the
fish to the Jew who marvelled at its make and said Extolled be the
perfection of the Most Excellent Creator Then he gave the fisherman a
dinar but he refused it and he gave him two This also he refused and
the Jew stayed not adding to his offer till he made it ten dinars but
he still refused and Abu alSaadat said to him By Allah thou art a
greedy one Tell me what thou wouldst have O Moslem Quoth Khalif I
would have of thee but a single word When the Jew heard this he
changed colour and said Wouldst thou oust me from my faith Wend thy
ways and Khalif said to him By Allah O Jew naught mattereth an
thou become a Moslem or a Nazarene Asked the Jew Then what wouldst
thou have me say and the fisherman answered Say I sell thee my ape
for thy ape and my luck for thy luck The Jew laughed deeming him
little of wit and said by way of jest I sell thee my ape for thy ape
and my luck for thy luck Bear witness against him O merchants By
Allah O unhappy thou art debarred from further claim on me So Khalif
turned back blaming himself and saying There is no Majesty and there
is no Might save in Allah the Glorious the Great Alas that I did not
take the gold and fared on blaming himself in the matter of the money
till he came to the Tigris but found not the two apes whereupon he
wept and slapped his face and strewed dust on his head saying But
that the second ape wheedled me and put a cheat on me the oneeyed ape
had not escaped And he gave not over wailing and weeping till heat
and hunger grew sore on him so he took the net saying Come let us
make a cast trusting in Allahs blessing belike I may catch a catfish
or a barbel which I may boil and eat So he threw the net and waiting
till it had settled drew it ashore and found it full of fish whereat
he was consoled and rejoiced and busied himself with unmeshing the fish
and casting them on the earth Presently up came a woman seeking fish
and crying out Fish is not to be found in the town She caught sight
of Khalif and said to him Wilt thou sell this fish O Master
Answered Khalif I am going to turn it into clothes tis all for sale
even to my beard Take what thou wilt So she gave him a dinar and
he filled her basket Then she went away and behold up came another
servant seeking a dinars worth of fish nor did the folk cease till it
was the hour of midafternoon prayer and Khalif had sold ten golden
dinars worth of fish Then being faint and famisht he folded and
shouldered his net and repairing to the market bought himself a
woollen gown a calotte with a plaited boarder and a honeycoloured
turband for a dinar receiving two dirhams by way of change wherewith
he purchased fried cheese and a fat sheeps tail and honey and setting
them in the oilmans platter ate till he was full and his ribs felt
cold from the mighty stuffing Then he marched off to his lodgings
in the magazine clad in the gown and the honeycoloured turband and
with the nine golden dinars in his mouth rejoicing in what he had never
in his life seen He entered and lay down but could not sleep for
anxious thoughts and abode playing with the money half the night Then
said he in himself Haply the Caliph may hear that I have gold and say
to JaafarGo to Khalif the Fisherman and borrow us some money of him
If I give it him it will be no light matter to me and if I give it
not he will torment me but torture is easier to me than the giving up
of the cash However I will arise and make trial of myself if I
have a skin proof against stick or not So he put off his clothes and
taking a sailors plaited whip of an hundred and sixty strands ceased
not beating himself till his sides and body were all bloody crying out
at every stroke he dealt himself and saying O Moslems I am a poor man
O Moslems I am a poor man O Moslems whence should I have gold whence
should I have coin till the neighbours who dwelt with him in that
place hearing him crying and saying Go to men of wealth and take of
them thought that thieves were torturing him to get money from him
and that he was praying for aidance Accordingly they flocked to him
each armed with some weapon and finding the door of his lodging locked
and hearing him roaring out for help deemed that the thieves had come
down upon him from the terraceroof so they fell upon the door and
burst it open Then they entered and found him mothernaked and
bareheaded with body dripping blood and altogether in a sad pickle so
they asked him What is this case in which we find thee Hast thou lost
thy wits and hath Jinnmadness betided thee this night And he answered
them Nay but I have gold with me and I feared lest the Caliph send to
borrow of me and it were no light matter to give him aught yet an I
gave not to him tis only too sure that he would put me to the torture
wherefore I arose to see if my skin were stickproof or not When they
heard these words they said to him May Allah not assain thy body
unlucky madman that thou art Of a surety thou art fallen mad tonight
Lie down to sleep may Allah never bless thee How many thousand dinars
hast thou that the Caliph should come and borrow of thee He replied
By Allah I have naught but nine dinars And they all said By Allah
he is not otherwise than passing rich Then they left him wondering at
his want of wit and Khalif took his cash and wrapped it in a rag
saying to himself Where shall I hide all this gold An I bury it they
will take it and if I put it out on deposit they will deny that I did
so and if I carry it on my head they will snatch it and if I tie
it to my sleeve they will cut it away Presently he espied a little
breastpocket in the gown and said By Allah this is fine Tis under
my throat and hard by my mouth if any put out his hand to hend it I
can come down on it with my mouth and hide it in my throttle So he set
the rag containing the gold in the pocket and lay down but slept not
that night for suspicion and trouble and anxious thought On the morrow
he fared forth of his lodging on fishing intent and betaking himself to
the river went down into the water up to his knees Then he threw the
net and shook it with might and main whereupon the purse fell down into
the stream So he tore off gown and turband and plunged in after it
saying There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the
Glorious the Great Nor did he give over diving and searching the
streambed till the day was half spent but found not the purse Now
one saw him from afar diving and plunging and his gown and turband lying
in the sun at a distance from him with no one by them so he watched
him till he dived again when he dashed at the clothes and made off with
them Presently Khalif came ashore and missing his gown and turband
was chagrined for their loss with passing cark and care and ascended a
mound to look for some passerby of whom he might enquire concerning
them but found none Now the Caliph Harun alRashid had gone ahunting
and chasing that day and returning at the time of the noon heat was
oppressed thereby and thirsted so he looked for water from afar and
seeing a naked man standing on the mound said to Jaafar Seest thou
what I see Replied the Wazir Yes O Commander of the Faithful I see
a man standing on a hillock AlRashid asked What is he and
Jaafar answered Haply he is the guardian of a cucumberplot Quoth
the Caliph Perhaps he is a pious man I would fain go to him
alone and desire of him his prayers and abide ye where you are So he
went up to Khalif and saluting him with the salam said to him What art
thou O man Replied the fisherman Dost thou not know me I am Khalif
the Fisherman and the Caliph rejoined What The fisherman with the
woollen gown and the honeycoloured turband When Khalif heard him
name the clothes he had lost he said in himself This is he who took
my duds belike he did but jest with me So he came down from the knoll
and said Can I not take a noontide nap but thou must trick me
this trick I saw thee take my gear and knew that thou wast joking with
me At this laughter got the better of the Caliph and he said What
clothes hast thou lost I know nothing of that whereof thou speakest O
Khalif Cried the Fisherman By God the Great except thou bring me
back the gear I will smash thy ribs with this staff For he always
carried a quarterstaff Quoth the Caliph By Allah I have not seen
the things whereof thou speakest and quoth Khalif I will go with
thee and take note of thy dwellingplace and complain of thee to the
Chief of Police so thou mayst not trick me this trick again By Allah
none took my gown and turband but thou and except thou give them back
to me at once I will throw thee off the back of that sheass thou
ridest and come down on thy pate with this quarterstaff till thou canst
not stir Thereupon he tugged at the bridle of the mule so that she
reared up on her hind legs and the Caliph said to himself What
calamity is this I have fallen into with this madman Then he pulled
off a gown he had on worth an hundred dinars and said to Khalif Take
this gown in lieu of thine own He took it and donning it saw it was
too long so he cut it short at the knees and turbanded his head with
the cutoff piece then said to the Caliph What art thou and what is
thy craft But why ask Thou art none other than a trumpeter AlRashid
asked What showed thee that I was a trumpeter by trade and Khalif
answered Thy big nostrils and little mouth Cried the Caliph Well
guessed Yes I am of that craft Then said Khalif An thou wilt
hearken to me I will teach thee the art of fishing twill be better
for thee than trumpeting and thou wilt eat lawfully Replied the
Caliph Teach it me so that I may see whether I am capable of learning
it And Khalif said Come with me O trumpeter So the Caliph
followed him down to the river and took the net from him whilst he
taught him how to throw it Then he cast it and drew it up when
behold it was heavy and the fisherman said O trumpeter an the net
be caught on one of the rocks drag it not too hard or twill break and
by Allah I will take thy sheass in payment thereof The Caliph
laughed at his words and drew up the net little by little till he
brought it ashore and found it full of fish which when Khalif saw his
reason fled for joy and presently he cried By Allah O trumpeter thy
luck is good in fishing Never in my life will I part with thee But now
I mean to send thee to the fishbazar where do thou enquire for the
shop of Humayd the fisherman and say to himMy master Khalif saluteth
thee and biddeth thee send him a pair of frails and a knife so he may
bring thee more fish than yesterday Run and return to me forthright
The Caliph replied and indeed he was laughing On my head O master
and mounting his mule rode back to Jaafar who said to him Tell me
what hath betided thee So the Caliph told him all that had passed
between Khalif the Fisherman and himself from first to last adding I
left him awaiting my return to him with the baskets and I am resolved
that he shall teach me how to scale fish and clean them Quoth Jaafar
And I will go with thee to sweep up the scales and clean out the shop
And the affair abode thus till presently the Caliph cried O Jaafar
I desire of thee that thou despatch the young Mamelukes saying to
themWhoso bringeth me a fish from before yonder fisherman I will give
him a dinar for I love to eat of my own fishing Accordingly Jaafar
repeated to the young white slaves what the Caliph had said and directed
them where to find the man They came down upon Khalif and snatched the
fish from him and when he saw them and noted their goodliness he
doubted not but that they were of the blackeyed Houris of Paradise so
he caught up a couple of fish and ran into the river saying O Allah
mine by the secret virtue of these fish forgive me Suddenly up came
the chief eunuch questing fish but he found none so seeing Khalif
ducking and rising in the water with the two fish in his hands called
out to him saying O Khalif what hast thou there Replied the
fisherman Two fish and the eunuch said Give them to me and take an
hundred dinars for them Now when Khalif heard speak of an hundred
dinars he came up out of the water and cried Hand over the hundred
dinars Said the eunuch Follow me to the house of AlRashid and
receive thy gold O Khalif and taking the fish made off to the
Palace of the Caliphate Meanwhile Khalif betook himself to Baghdad
clad as he was in the Caliphs gown which reached only to above his
knees turbanded with the piece he had cut off therefrom and girt
about his middle with a rope and he pushed through the centre of the
city The folk fell alaughing and marvelling at him and saying Whence
hadst thou that robe of honour But he went on asking Where is the
house of AlRashd and they answered Say The house of
AlRashd and he rejoined Tis all the same and fared on till he
came to the Palace of the Caliphate Now he was seen by the tailor who
had made the gown and who was standing at the door and when he noticed
it upon the Fisherman he said to him For how many years hast thou had
admission to the palace Khalif replied Ever since I was a little
one and the tailor asked Whence hadest thou that gown thou hast
spoilt on this wise Khalif answered I had it of my apprentice the
trumpeter Then he went up to the door where he found the Chief Eunuch
sitting with the two fishes by his side and seeing him sableblack of
hue said to him Wilt thou not bring the hundred dinars O uncle
Tulip Quoth he On my head O Khalif when behold out came Jaafar
from the presence of the Caliph and seeing the fisherman talking with
the Eunuch and saying to him This is the reward of goodness O nuncle
Tulip went in to AlRashid and said to him O Commander of the
Faithful thy master the Fisherman is with the Chief Eunuch dunning him
for an hundred dinars Cried the Caliph Bring him to me O Jaafar
and the Minister answered Hearing and obeying So he went out to the
Fisherman and said to him O Khalif thine apprentice the trumpeter
biddeth thee to him then he walked on followed by the other till they
reached the presencechamber where he saw the Caliph seated with a
canopy over his head When he entered AlRashid wrote three scrolls and
set them before him and the Fisherman said to him So thou hast given
up trumpeting and turned astrologer Quoth the Caliph to him Take
thee a scroll Now in the first he had written Let him be given a
gold piece in the second An hundred dinars and in the third Let
him be given an hundred blows with a whip So Khalif put out his hand
and by the decree of the Predestinator it lighted on the scroll wherein
was written Let him receive an hundred lashes and Kings whenas they
ordain aught go not back therefrom So they threw him prone on the
ground and beat him an hundred blows whilst he wept and roared for
succour but none succoured him and said By Allah this is a good
joke O trumpeter I teach thee fishing and thou turnest astrologer and
drawest me an unlucky lot Fie upon thee in thee is naught of
good When the Caliph heard his speech he fell fainting in a fit of
laughter and said O Khalif no harm shall betide thee fear not Give
him an hundred gold pieces So they gave him an hundred dinars and he
went out and ceased not faring forth till he came to the trunkmarket
where he found the folk assembled in a ring about a broker who was
crying out and saying At an hundred dinars less one dinar A locked
chest So he pressed on and pushed through the crowd and said to the
broker Mine for an hundred dinars The broker closed with him and
took his money whereupon there was left him nor little nor much The
porters disputed awhile about who should carry the chest and presently
all said By Allah none shall carry this chest but Zurayk And
the folk said Blueeyes hath the best right to it So Zurayk
shouldered the chest after the goodliest fashion and walked arear of
Khalif As they went along the Fisherman said in himself I have
nothing left to give the porter how shall I rid myself of him Now I
will traverse the main streets with him and lead him about till he be
weary and set it down and leave it when I will take it up and carry it
to my lodging Accordingly he went round about the city with the
porter from noontide to sundown till the man began to grumble and
said O my lord where is thy house Quoth Khalif Yesterday I knew
it but today I have forgotten it And the porter said Give me my
hire and take thy chest But Khalif said Go on at thy leisure till I
bethink me where my house is presently adding O Zurayk I have no
money with me Tis all in my house and I have forgotten where it is
As they were talking there passed by them one who knew the Fisherman
and said to him O Khalif what bringeth thee hither Quoth the
porter O uncle where is Khalifs house and quoth he Tis in the
ruined Khan in the Rawsn Quarter Then said Zurayk to Khalif
Go to would Heaven thou hadst never lived nor been And the Fisherman
trudged on followed by the porter till they came to the place when the
Hammal said O thou whose daily bread Allah cut off in this world have
we not passed this place a score of times Hadst thou said to me Tis
in such a stead thou hadst spared me this great toil but now give me
my wage and let me wend my way Khalif replied Thou shalt have
silver if not gold Stay here till I bring thee the same So he
entered his lodging and taking a mallet he had there studded with forty
nails wherewith an he smote a camel he had made an end of it rushed
upon the porter and raised his forearm to strike him therewith but
Zurayk cried out at him saying Hold thy hand I have no claim on
thee and fled Now having got rid of the Hammal Khalif carried the
chest into the Khan whereupon the neighbours came down and flocked
about him saying O Khalif whence hadst thou this robe and this
chest Quoth he From my apprentice AlRashid who gave them to me
and they said The pimp is mad AlRashid will assuredly hear of his
talk and hang him over the door of his lodging and hang all in the Khan
on account of the droll This is a fine farce Then they helped him to
carry the chest into his lodging and it filled the whole closet
Thus far concerning Khalif but as for the history of the chest it was
as follows The Caliph had a Turkish slavegirl by name Kut alKulb
whom he loved with love exceeding and the Lady Zubaydah came to know of
this from himself and was passing jealous of her and secretly plotted
mischief against her So whilst the Commander of the Faithful was
absent asporting and ahunting she sent for Kut alKulub and inviting
her to a banquet set before her meat and wine and she ate and drank
Now the wine was drugged with Bhang so she slept and Zubaydah sent for
her Chief Eunuch and putting her in a great chest locked it and gave it
to him saying Take this chest and cast it into the river Thereupon
he took it up before him on a hemule and set out with it for the sea
but found it unfit to carry so as he passed by the trunkmarket he
saw the Shaykh of the brokers and salesmen and said to him Wilt thou
sell me this chest O uncle The broker replied Yes we will do this
much But said the Eunuch look thou sell it not except locked
and the other Tis well we will do that also So he set down
the chest and they cried it for sale saying Who will buy this chest
for an hundred dinars and behold up came Khalif the Fisherman and
bought the chest after turning it over right and left and there passed
between him and the porter that which hath been before set out Now as
regards Khalif the Fisherman he lay down on the chest to sleep and
presently Kut alKulub awoke from her Bhang and finding herself in the
chest cried out and said Alas Whereupon Khalif sprang off the
chestlid and cried out and said Ho Moslems Come to my help There
are Ifrits in the chest So the neighbours awoke from sleep and said to
him What mattereth thee O madman Quoth he The chest is full of
Ifrits and quoth they Go to sleep thou hast troubled our rest this
night may Allah not bless thee Go in and sleep without madness He
ejaculated I cannot sleep but they abused him and he went in and lay
down once more And behold Kut alKulub spoke and said Where am I
Upon which Khalif fled forth the closet and said O neighbours of the
hostelry come to my aid Quoth they What hath befallen thee Thou
troublest the neighbours rest O folk there be Ifrits in the chest
moving and speaking Thou liest what do they say They say Where
am I Would Heaven thou wert in Hell Thou disturbest the neighbours
and hinderest them of sleep Go to sleep would thou hadst never lived
nor been So Khalif went in fearful because he had no place wherein to
sleep save upon the chestlid when lo as he stood with ears listening
for speech Kut alKulub spake again and said Im hungry So in sore
affright he fled forth and cried out Ho neighbours ho dwellers in the
Khan come aid me Said they What is thy calamity now And he
answered The Ifrits in the chest say We are hungry Quoth the
neighbours one to other Twould seem Khalif is hungry let us feed him
and give him the supperorts else he will not let us sleep tonight
So they brought him bread and meat and broken victuals and radishes and
gave him a basket full of all kinds of things saying Eat till thou be
full and go to sleep and talk not else will we break thy ribs and beat
thee to death this very night So he took the basket with the provaunt
and entered his lodging Now it was a moonlight night and the moon shone
in full sheen upon the chest and lit up the closet with its light
seeing this he sat down on his purchase and fell to eating of the food
with both hands Presently Kut alKulub spake again and said Open to
me and have mercy upon me O Moslems So Khalif arose and taking a
stone he had by him broke the chest open and behold therein lay a
young lady as she were the suns shining light with brow flowerwhite
face moonbright cheeks of rosehue exquisite and speech sweeter than
sugarbite and in dress worth a thousand dinars and more bedight
Seeing this his wits flew from his head for joy and he said By Allah
thou art of the fair She asked him What art thou O fellow and he
answered O my lady I am Khalif the Fisherman Quoth she Who
brought me hither and quoth he I bought thee and thou art my
slavegirl Thereupon said she I see on thee a robe of the raiment of
the Caliph So he told her all that had betided him from first to
last and how he had bought the chest wherefore she knew that the Lady
Zubaydah had played her false and she ceased not talking with him till
the morning when she said to him O Khalif seek me from some one
inkcase and reedpen and paper and bring them to me So he found with
one of the neighbours what she sought and brought it to her whereupon
she wrote a letter and folded it and gave it to him saying O Khalif
take this paper and carry it to the jewelmarket where do thou enquire
for the shop of Abu alHasan the jeweller and give it to him Answered
the Fisherman O my lady this name is difficult to me I cannot
remember it And she rejoined Then ask for the shop of Ibn
alUkb Quoth he O my lady what is an Ukab and quoth she
Tis a bird which folk carry on fist with eyes hooded And he
exclaimed O my lady I know it Then he went forth from her and fared
on repeating the name lest it fade from his memory but by the time
he reached the jewelmarket he had forgotten it So he accosted one of
the merchants and said to him Is there any here named after a bird
Replied the merchant Yes thou meanest Ibn alUkab Khalif cried
Thats the man I want and making his way to him gave him the letter
which when he read and knew the purport thereof he fell to kissing it
and laying it on his head for it is said that Abu alHasan was the
agent of the Lady Kut alKulub and her intendant over all her property
in lands and houses Now she had written to him saying From Her
Highness the Lady Kut alKulub to Sir Abu alHasan the jeweller The
instant this letter reacheth thee set apart for us a saloon completely
equipped with furniture and vessels and negroslaves and slavegirls and
what not else is needful for our residence and seemly and take the
bearer of the missive and carry him to the bath Then clothe him in
costly apparel and do with him thus and thus So he said Hearing and
obeying and locking up his shop took the Fisherman and bore him to
the bath where he committed him to one of the bathmen that he might
serve him according to custom Then he went forth to carry out the Lady
Kut alKulubs orders As for Khalif he concluded of his lack of wit
and stupidity that the bath was a prison and said to the bathman What
crime have I committed that ye should lay me in limbo They laughed at
him and made him sit on the side of the tank whilst the bathman took
hold of his legs that he might shampoo them Khalif thought he meant to
wrestle with him and said to himself This is a wrestlingplace
and I knew naught of it Then he arose and seizing the bathmans legs
lifted him up and threw him on the ground and broke his ribs The man
cried out for help whereupon the other bathmen came in a crowd and fell
upon Khalif and overcoming him by dint of numbers delivered their
comrade from his clutches and tunded him till he came to himself Then
they knew that the Fisherman was a simpleton and served him till Abu
alHasan came back with a dress of rich stuff and clad him therein
after which he brought him a handsome shemule ready saddled and
taking him by the hand carried him forth of the bath and said to him
Mount Quoth he How shall I mount I fear lest she throw me and
break my ribs into my belly Nor would he back the mule save after
much travail and trouble and they stinted not faring on till they came
to the place which Abu alHasan had set apart for the Lady Kut alKulub
Thereupon Khalif entered and found her sitting with slaves and eunuchs
about her and the porter at the door staff in hand who when he saw the
Fisherman sprang up and kissing his hand went before him till he
brought him within the saloon Here the Fisherman saw what amazed his
wit and his eye was dazzled by that which he beheld of riches past
count and slaves and servants who kissed his hand and said May the
bath be a blessing to thee When he entered the saloon and drew
near unto Kut alKulub she sprang up to him and taking him by the hand
seated him on a highmattressed divan Then she brought him a vase of
sherbet of sugar mingled with rosewater and willowwater and he took
it and drank it off and left not a single drop Moreover he ran his
finger round the inside of the vessel and would have licked it but
she forbade him saying That is foul Quoth he Silence this is
naught but good honey and she laughed at him and set before him a tray
of meats whereof he ate his sufficiency Then they brought an ewer and
basin of gold and he washed his right hand and abode in the gladdest of
life and the most honourable Now hear what befel the Commander of the
Faithful When he came back from his journey and found not Kut alKulub
he questioned the Lady Zubaydah of her and she said She is verily
dead may thy head live O Prince of True Believers But she had bidden
dig a grave amiddlemost the Palace and had built over it a mock tomb
for her knowledge of the love the Caliph bore to Kut alKulub so she
said to him O Commander of the Faithful I made her a tomb amiddlemost
the Palace and buried her there Then she donned black a mere
sham and pure pretence and feigned mourning a great while Now Kut
alKulub knew that the Caliph was come back from his hunting excursion
so she turned to Khalif and said to him Arise hie thee to the bath
and come back So he rose and went to the Hammambath and when he
returned she clad him in a dress worth a thousand dinars and taught him
manners and respectful bearing to superiors Then said she to him Go
hence to the Caliph and say to himO Commander of the Faithful tis my
desire that this night thou deign be my guest So Khalif arose and
mounting his shemule rode with pages and black slaves before him
till he came to the Palace of the Caliphate Quoth the wise Dress up a
stick and twill look chique And indeed his comeliness was
manifest and his goodliness and the folk marvelled at this Presently
the Chief Eunuch saw him the same who had given him the hundred dinars
that had been the cause of his good fortune so he went in to the Caliph
and said to him O Commander of the Faithful Khalif the Fisherman is
become a King and on him is a robe of honour worth a thousand dinars
The Prince of True Believers bade admit him so he entered and said
Peace be with thee O Commander of the Faithful and Viceregent of the
Lord of the three Worlds and Defender of the folk of the Faith Allah
Almighty prolong thy days and honour thy dominion and exalt thy degree
to the highmost height The Caliph looked at him and marvelled at him
and how fortune had come to him at unawares then he said to him O
Khalif whence hadst thou that robe which is upon thee He replied O
Commander of the Faithful it cometh from my house Quoth the Caliph
Hast thou then a house and quoth Khalif Yea verily and thou O
Commander of the Faithful art my guest this day AlRashid said I
alone O Khalif or I and those who are with me and he replied Thou
and whom thou wilt So Jaafar turned to him and said We will be thy
guests this night whereupon he kissed ground again and withdrawing
mounted his mule and rode off attended by his servants and suite of
Mamelukes leaving the Caliph marvelling at this and saying to Jaafar
Sawest thou Khalif with his mule and dress his white slaves and his
dignity But yesterday I knew him for a buffoon and a jester And they
marvelled at this much Then they mounted and rode till they drew near
Khalifs house when the Fisherman alighted and taking a bundle from
one of his attendants opened it and pulled out therefrom a piece of
tabby silk and spread it under the hoofs of the Caliphs shemule
then he brought out a piece of velvetKimcob and a third of fine
satin and did with them likewise and thus he spread well nigh twenty
pieces of rich stuffs till AlRashid and his suite had reached the
house when he came forward and said Bismillah O Commander of
the Faithful Quoth AlRashid to Jaafar I wonder to whom this house
may belong and quoth he It belongeth to a man hight Ibn alUkab
Syndic of the Jewellers So the Caliph dismounted and entering with
his courtiers saw a highbuilded saloon spacious and boon with
couches on dais and carpets and divans strown in place So he went up to
the couch that was set for himself on four legs of ivory plated with
glittering gold and covered with seven carpets This pleased him and
behold up came Khalif with eunuchs and little white slaves bearing
all manner sherbets compounded with sugar and lemon and perfumed with
rose and willowwater and the purest musk The Fisherman advanced and
drank and gave the Caliph to drink and the cupbearers came forward and
served the rest of the company with the sherbets Then Khalif brought a
table spread with meats of various colours and geese and fowls and other
birds saying In the name of Allah So they ate their fill after
which he bade remove the tables and kissing the ground three times
before the Caliph craved his royal leave to bring wine and music
He granted him permission for this and turning to Jaafar said to him
As my head liveth the house and that which is therein is Khalifs for
that he is ruler over it and I am in admiration at him whence there
came to him this passing prosperity and exceeding felicity However
this is no great matter to Him who saith to a thing Be and it
becometh what I most wonder at is his understanding how it hath
increased and whence he hath gotten this loftiness and this lordliness
but when Allah willeth weal unto a man He amendeth his intelligence
before bringing him to worldly affluence As they were talking behold
up came Khalif followed by cupbearer lads like moons belted with
zones of gold who spread a cloth of siglaton and set thereon
flagons of chinaware and tall flasks of glass and cups of crystal and
bottles and hanaps of all colours and those flagons they filled
with pure clear and old wine whose scent was as the fragrance of virgin
musk and it was even as saith the poet

 Ply me and also my mate be plied  With pure wine prest in the olden
    tide
 Daughter of nobles they lead her forth  In raiment of goblets
    beautified
 They belt her round with the brightest gems  And pearls and unions
    the Oceans pride
 So I by these signs and signets know  Wherefore the Wine is entitled
    Bride

And round about these vessels were confections and flowers such as may
not be surpassed When AlRashid saw this from Khalif he inclined to
him and smiled upon him and invested him with an office so Khalif
wished him continuance of honour and endurance of days and said Will
the Commander of the Faithful deign give me leave to bring him a singer
a luteplayer her like was never heard among mortals ever Quoth the
Caliph Thou art permitted So he kissed ground before him and going
to a secret closet called Kut alKulub who came after she had
disguised and falsed and veiled herself tripping in her robes and
trinkets and she kissed ground before the Commander of the Faithful
Then she sat down and tuning the lute touched its strings and played
upon it till all present were like to faint for excess of delight
after which she improvised these verses

 Would Heaven I wot will ever Time bring our beloveds back again  And
    ah will Union and its bliss to bless two lovers deign
 Will Time assure to us united days and joind joy  While from the
    storms and stowres of life in safety we remain
 Then O Who bade this pleasure be our parting past and gone  And made
    one house our meetingstead throughout the Nights contain
 By him draw near me love and closest cling to side of me  Else were
    my wearied wasted life a vanity a bane

When the Caliph heard this he could not master himself but rent his
raiment and fell down aswoon whereupon all who were present hastened
to doff their dress and throw it over him whilst Kut alKulub signed to
Khalif and said to him Hie to yonder chest and bring us what is
therein for she had made ready therein a suit of the Caliphs wear
against the like of such hour as this So Khalif brought it to her and
she threw it over the Commander of the Faithful who came to himself and
knowing her for Kut alKulub said Is this the Day of Resurrection and
hath Allah quickened those who are in the tombs or am I asleep and is
this an imbroglio of dreams Quoth Kut alKulub We are on wake not
on sleep and I am alive nor have I drained the cup of death Then she
told him all that had befallen her and indeed since he lost her life
had not been light to him nor had sleep been sweet and he abode now
wondering then weeping and anon afire for longing When she had made an
end of her story the Caliph rose and took her by the hand intending
for her palace after he had kissed her inner lips and had strained her
to his bosom whereupon Khalif rose and said By Allah O Commander of
the Faithful Thou hast already wronged me once and now thou wrongest
me again Quoth AlRashid Indeed thou speakest sooth O Khalif and
bade the Wazir Jaafar give him what should satisfy him So he
straightway gifted him with all for which he wished and assigned him a
village the yearly revenues whereof were twenty thousand dinars
Moreover Kut alKulub generously presented him the house and all that
was therein of furniture and hangings and white slaves and slavegirls
and eunuchs great and small So Khalif became possessed of this passing
affluence and exceeding wealth and took him a wife and prosperity
taught him gravity and dignity and good fortune overwhelmed him The
Caliph enrolled him among his equerries and he abode in all solace of
life and its delights till he deceased and was admitted to the mercy of
Allah Furthermore they relate a tale anent

                    MASRUR AND ZAYN ALMAWASIF


There was once in days of yore and in ages and times long gone before a
man and a merchant Masrr hight who was of the comeliest of the folk of
his tide a wight of wealth galore and in easiest case but he loved to
take his pleasure in vergiers and flowergardens and to divert himself
with the love of the fair Now it fortuned one night as he lay asleep
he dreamt that he was in a garth of the loveliest wherein were four
birds and amongst them a dove white as polished silver That dove
pleased him and for her grew up in his heart an exceeding love
Presently he beheld a great bird swoop down on him and snatch the dove
from his hand and this was grievous to him After which he awoke and
not finding the bird strave with his yearnings till morning when he
said in himself There is no help but that I go today to some one who
will expound to me this visionAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of
day and ceased to say her permitted say


        Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Fortysixth Night

She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the
merchant awoke he strave with his yearnings till morning when he said
to himself There is no help but that I go this day to some one who
will expound to me this vision So he went forth and walked right and
left till he was far from his dwellingplace but found none to
interpret the dream to him Then he would have returned but on his way
behold the fancy took him to turn aside to the house of a certain
trader a man of the wealthiest and when he drew near to it suddenly
he heard from within a plaintive voice from a sorrowful heart reciting
these couplets

 The breeze o Morn blows uswards from her trace  Fragrant and heals
    the lovesick lovers case
 I stand like captive on the mounds and ask  While tears make answer for
    the ruined place
 Quoth I By Allah Breeze o Morning say  Shall Time and Fortune aye
    this stead regrace
 Shall I enjoy a fawn whose form bewitched  And languorous eyelids
    wasted frame and face

When Masrur heard this he looked in through the doorway and saw a
garden of the goodliest of gardens and at its farther end a curtain of
red brocade purfled with pearls and gems behind which sat four
damsels and amongst them a young lady over four feet and under five in
height as she were the rondure of the lune and the full moon shining
boon she had eyes Kohld with natures dye and joined eyebrows a mouth
as it were Solomons seal and lips and teeth bright with pearls and
corals light and indeed she ravished all wits with her beauty and
loveliness and symmetry and perfect grace When Masrur espied her he
entered the porch and went on entering till he came to the curtain
whereupon she raised her head and glanced at him So he saluted her and
she returned his salam with sweetest speech and when he considered her
more straitly his reason was dazed and his heart amazed Then he looked
at the garden and saw that it was full of jessamine and gilly flowers
and violets and roses and orange blossoms and all manner sweetscented
blooms and herbs Every tree was girt about with fruits and there
coursed down water from four daises which faced one another and
occupied the four corners of the garden He looked at the first Lwn
and found written around it with vermilion these two couplets

 Ho thou the House Grief never home in thee  Nor Time work treason on
    thine owners head
 All good betide the House which every guest  Harbours when sore
    distrest for way and stead

Then he looked at the second das and found written thereon in red gold
these couplets

 Robe thee O House in richest raiment Time  Long as the birdies on
    the branchlets chime
 And sweetest perfumes breathe within thy walls  And lover meet beloved
    in bliss sublime
 And dwell thy dwellers all in joy and pride  Long as the wandering
    stars Heavenhill shall climb

Then he looked at the third whereon he found written in ultramarine
these two couplets

 Ever thy pomp and pride O House display  While starkeneth Night and
    shineth sheeny Day
 Boon Fortune bless all entering thy walls  And whomso dwell in thee
    for ever and aye

Then he looked at the fourth and saw painted in yellow characters this
couplet

 This garden and this lake in truth  Are fair sittingsteads by the
    Lord of Ruth

Moreover in that garden were birds of all breeds ringdove and cushat
and nightingale and culver each singing his several song and amongst
them the lady swaying gracefully to and fro in her beauty and grace and
symmetry and loveliness and ravishing all who saw her Presently quoth
she to Masrur Hola man what bringeth thee into a house other than thy
house and wherefore comest thou in unto women other than thy women
without leave of their owner Quoth he O my lady I saw this garden
and the goodliness of its greenery pleased me and the fragrance of its
flowers and the carolling of its birds so I entered thinking to gaze
on it awhile and wend my way Said she With love and gladness and
Masrur was amazed at the sweetness of her speech and the coquetry of her
glances and the straightness of her shape and transported by her beauty
and seemlihead and the pleasantness of the garden and the birds So in
the disorder of his spirits he recited these couplets

 As a crescentmoon in the garth her form  Mid Basil and Jasmine and
    Rose I scan
 And Violet faced by the Myrtlespray  And Nuumns bloom and
    Myrobalan
 By her perfume the Zephyrs perfumd breathe  And with scented sighings
    the branches fan
 O Garden thou perfect of beauty art  All charms comprising in perfect
    plan
 And melodious birdies sing madrigals  And the Full Moon shineth in
    branchshade wan

 Its ringdove its culver its mockingbird  And its Philomel sing my
    soul t unman
 And the longing of love all my wits confuseth  For her charms As the
    man whom his wine bemuseth

Now when Zayn alMawsif heard his verse she glanced at him with eyes
which bequeathed a thousand sighs and utterly ravished his wisdom and
wits and replied to him in these lines

 Hope not of our favours to make thy prey  And of what thou wishest thy
    greed allay
 And cease thy longing thou canst not win  The love of the Fair thourt
    fain t essay
 My glances to lovers are baleful and naught  I reek of thy speech I
    have said my say

Ho thou Begone about thy business for we are none of the womantribe
who are neither thine nor anothers And he answered O my lady
I said nothing ill Quoth she Thou soughtest to divert thyself
and thou hast had thy diversion so wend thy ways Quoth he O my
lady belike thou wilt give me a draught of water for I am athirst
Whereupon she cried How canst thou drink of a Jews water and thou a
Nazarene But he replied O my lady your water is not forbidden to us
nor ours unlawful to you for we are all as one creation So she said
to her slavegirl Give him to drink and she did as she was bidden
Then she called for the table of food and there came four damsels
highbosomed maids bearing four trays of meats and four gilt flagons
full of strong oldwine as it were the tears of a slave of love for
clearness and a table around whose edge were graven these couplets

 For eaters a table they brought and set  In the banquethall and twas
    dight with gold
 Like th Eternal Garden that gathers all  Man wants of meat and wines
    manifold

And when the highbreasted maids had set all this before him quoth she
Thou soughtest to drink of our drink so up and at our meat and drink
He could hardly credit what his ears had heard and sat down at the table
forthright whereupon she bade her nurse give him a cup that he
might drink Now her slavegirls were called one Hubb another Khutb
and the third Sukb and she who gave him the cup was Hubub So he
took the cup and looking at the outside there saw written these
couplets

 Drain not the bowl but with lovely wight  Who loves thee and wine makes
    brighter bright
 And ware her Scorpions that oer thee creep  And guard thy tongue
    lest thou vex her sprite

Then the cup went round and when he emptied it he looked inside and saw
written

 And ware her Scorpions when pressing them  And hide her secrets from
    foes despight

Whereupon Masrur laughed herwards and she asked him What causeth thee
to laugh For the fulness of my joy quoth he Presently the breeze
blew on her and the scarf fell from her head and discovered a
fillet of glittering gold set with pearls and gems and jacinths
and on her breast was a necklace of all manner ringjewels and precious
stones to the centre of which hung a sparrow of red gold with feet of
red coral and bill of white silver and body full of Naddpowder and pure
ambergris and odoriferous musk And upon its back was engraved

 The Nadd is my winescented powder my bread  And the bosoms my bed
    and the breasts my stead
 And my necknape complains of the weight of love  Of my pain of my
    pine of my drearihead

Then Masrur looked at the breast of her shift and behold thereon lay
wroughten in red gold this verse

 The fragrance of musk from the breasts of the fair  Zephyr borrows to
    sweeten the morning air

Masrur marvelled at this with exceeding wonder and was dazed by her
charms and amazement gat hold upon him Then said Zayn alMawsif to
him Begone from us and go about thy business lest the neighbours hear
of us and even us with the lewd He replied By Allah O my lady
suffer my sight to enjoy the view of thy beauty and loveliness With
this she was wroth with him and leaving him walked in the garden and
he looked at her shiftsleeve and saw upon it embroidered these lines

 The weaverwight wrote with goldore bright  And her wrists on brocade
    rained a brighter light
 Her palms are adorned with a silvern sheen  And favour her fingers the
    ivorys white
 For their tips are rounded like priceless pearl  And her charms would
    enlighten the nightiest night

And as she paced the garth Masrur gazed at her slippers and saw
written upon them these pleasant lines

 The slippers that carry these fair young feet  Cause her form to bend
    in its gracious bloom
 When she paces and waves in the breeze she owns  She shines fullest
    moon in the murkiest gloom

She was followed by her women leaving Hubub with Masrur by the curtain
upon whose edge were embroidered these couplets

 Behind the veil a damsel sits with gracious beauty dight  Praise to
    the Lord who decked her with these inner gifts of sprite
 Guards her the garden and the bird fain bears her company  Gladden her
    winedraughts and the bowl but makes her brighterbright
 Apple and Cassiablossom show their envy of her cheeks  And borrows
    Pearl resplendency from her resplendent light
 As though the sperm that gendered her were drop of marguerite 
    Happy who kisses her and spends in her embrace the night

So Masrur entered into a long discourse with Hubub and presently said to
her O Hubub hath thy mistress a husband or not She replied My
lady hath a husband but he is actually abroad on a journey with
merchandise of his Now whenas he heard that her husband was abroad on
a journey his heart lusted after her and he said O Hubub glorified
be He who created this damsel and fashioned her How sweet is her beauty
and her loveliness and her symmetry and perfect grace Verily into my
heart is fallen sore travail for her O Hubub so do that I come to
enjoy her and thou shalt have of me what thou wilt of wealth and what
not else Replied Hubub O Nazarene if she heard thee speak thus she
would slay thee or else she would kill herself for she is the daughter
of a Zealot of the Jews nor is there her like amongst them she
hath no need of money and she keepeth herself ever cloistered
discovering not her case to any Quoth Masrur O Hubub an thou wilt
but bring me to enjoy her I will be to thee slave and foot page and
will serve thee all my life and give thee whatsoever thou seekest of
me But quoth she O Masrur in very sooth this woman hath no lust for
money nor yet for men because my lady Zayn alMawasif is of the
cloistered going not forth her housedoor in fear lest folk see her
and but that she bore with thee by reason of thy strangerhood she had
not permitted thee to pass her threshold no not though thou wert her
brother He replied O Hubub be thou our gobetween and thou shalt
have of me an hundred gold dinars and a dress worth as much more for
that the love of her hath gotten hold of my heart Hearing this she
said O man let me go about with her in talk and I will return thee an
answer and acquaint thee with what she saith Indeed she loveth those
who berhyme her and she affecteth those who set forth her charms and
beauty and loveliness in verse and we may not prevail over her save by
wiles and soft speech and beguilement Thereupon Hubub rose and going
up to her mistress accosted her with privy talk of this and that and
presently said to her O my lady look at yonder young man the
Nazarene how sweet is his speech and how shapely his shape When Zayn
alMawasif heard this she turned to her and said An thou like his
comeliness love him thyself Art thou not ashamed to address the like of
me with these words Go bid him begone about his business or I will
make it the worse for him So Hubub returned to Masrur but acquainted
him not with that which her mistress had said Then the lady bade her
hie to the door and look if she saw any of the folk lest foul befal
them So she went and returning said O my lady without are folk in
plenty and we cannot let him go forth this night Quoth Zayn
alMawasif I am in dole because of a dream I have seen and am fearful
therefrom And Masrur said What sawest thou Allah never trouble thy
heart She replied I was asleep in the middle of the night when
suddenly an eagle swooped down upon me from the highest of the clouds
and would have carried me off from behind the curtain wherefore I was
affrighted at him Then I awoke from sleep and bade my women bring me
meat and drink so haply when I had drunken the dolour of the dream
would cease from me Hearing this Masrur smiled and told her his dream
from first to last and how he had caught the dove whereat she marvelled
with exceeding marvel Then he went on to talk with her at great length
and said I am now certified of the truth of my dream for thou art the
dove and I the eagle and there is no hope but that this must be for
the moment I set eyes on thee thou tookest possession of my vitals and
settest my heart afire for love of thee Thereupon Zayn alMawasif
became wroth with exceeding wrath and said to him I take refuge with
Allah from this Allah upon thee begone about thy business ere the
neighbours espy thee and there betide us sore reproach adding
Harkye man Let not thy soul covet that it shall not obtain Thou
weariest thyself in vain for I am a merchants wife and a merchants
daughter and thou art a druggist and when sawest thou a druggist and a
merchants daughter conjoined by such sentiment He replied O my
lady never lacked loveliesse between folk so cut thou not off
from me hope of this and whatsoever thou seekest of me of money and
raiment and ornaments and what not else I will give thee Then he
abode with her in discourse and mutual blaming whilst she still
redoubled in anger till it was black night when he said to her O my
lady take this gold piece and fetch me a little wine for I am athirst
and heavy hearted So she said to the slavegirl Hubub Fetch him wine
and take naught from him for we have no need of his dinar So she went
whilst Masrur held his peace and bespake not the lady who suddenly
improvised these lines

 Leave this thy design and depart O man  Nor tread paths where
    lewdness and crime trepan
 Love is a net shall enmesh thy sprite  Make thee rise amorning sad
    weary and wan
 For our spy thou shalt eke be the cause of talk  And for thee shall
    blame me my tribe and clan

 Yet scant I marvel thou lovest a Fair  Gazelles hunting lions we aye
    shall scan

And he answered her with these

 Joy of boughs bright branch of Myrobalan  Have ruth on the heart all
    thy charms unman
 Deathcup to the dregs thou garrest me drain  And don weed of Love with
    its bane and ban
 How can soothe I a heart which for stress of pine  Burns with living
    coals which my longings fan

Hearing these lines she exclaimed Away from me Quoth the saw Whoso
looseth his sight wearieth his sprite By Allah I am tired of
discourse with thee and chiding and indeed thy soul coveteth that shall
never become thine nay though thou gave me my weight in gold thou
shouldst not get thy wicked will of me for I know naught of the things
of the world save pleasant life by the boon of Allah Almighty He
answered O my lady Zayn alMawasif ask of me what thou wilt of the
goods of the world Quoth she What shall I ask of thee For sure thou
wilt fare forth and prate of me in the highway and I shall become a
laughingstock among the folk and they will make a byword of me in
verse me who am the daughter of the chief of the merchants and whose
father is known of the notables of the tribe I have no need of money or
raiment and such love will not be hidden from the people and I shall be
brought to shame I and my kith and kin With this Masrur was
confounded and could make her no answer but presently she said
Indeed the masterthief if he steal stealeth not but what is worth
his neck and every woman who doth lewdness with other than her husband
is styled a thief so if it must be thus and no help thou shalt
give me whatsoever my heart desireth of money and raiment and ornaments
and what not Quoth he An thou sought of me the world and all its
regions contain from its East to its West twere but a little thing
compared with thy favour and quoth she I will have of thee three
suits each worth a thousand Egyptian dinars and adorned with gold and
fairly purfled with pearls and jewels and jacinths the best of their
kind Furthermore I require that thou swear to me thou wilt keep my
secret nor discover it to any and that thou wilt company with none but
me and I in turn will swear to thee a true oath that I will never false
thee in love So he sware to her the oath she required and she sware to
him and they agreed upon this after which she said to her nurse Hubub
Tomorrow go thou with Masrur to his lodging and seek somewhat of musk
and ambergris and Nadd and rosewater and see what he hath If he be a
man of condition we will take him into favour but an he be otherwise
we will leave him Then said she to him O Masrur I desire somewhat
of musk and ambergris and aloeswood and Nadd so do thou send it me by
Hubub and he answered With love and gladness my shop is at thy
disposal Then the wine went round between them and their sance was
sweet but Masrurs heart was troubled for the passion and pining which
possessed him and when Zayn alMawasif saw him in this plight she said
to her slavegirl Sukub Arouse Masrur from his stupor mayhap he will
recover Answered Sukub Hearkening and obedience and sang these
couplets

 Bring gold and gear an a lover thou  And hymn thy love so success
    shalt row
 Joy the smiling fawn with the blackedged eyne  And the bending lines
    of the Cassiabough
 On her look and a marvel therein shalt sight  And pour out thy life
    ere thy lifeterm show
 Loves affect be this an thou weet the same  But an gold deceive
    thee leave gold and go

Hereupon Masrur understood her and said I hear and apprehend Never
was grief but after came relief and after affliction dealing He will
order the healing Then Zayn alMawasif recited these couplets

 From Lovestupor awake O Masrur twere best  For this day I dread my
    love rend thy breast
 And tomorrow I fear me folks marveltale  Shall make us a byword from
    East to West
 Leave love of my like or thoult gain thee blame  Why turn thee
    uswards Such loves unblest
 For one strange of lineage whose kin repel  Thou shalt wake illfamed
    of friends dispossest
 Im a Zealots child and affright the folk  Would my life were ended
    and I at rest

Then Masrur answered her improvisation and began to say these lines

 To grief leave a heart that to love neer ceased  Nor blame for your
    blame ever love increased
 You misrule my vitals in tyrantguise  Morn and Eve I wend not or West
    or East
 Loves law forbids me to do me die  They say Loves victim is neer
    released
 Wellaway Could I find in Loves Court a judge  Id plain and win to
    my rights at least

They ceased not from mutual chiding till morning morrowed when Zayn
alMawasif said O Masrur tis time for thee to depart lest one of the
folk see thee and foul befal us twain So he arose and accompanied by
nurse Hubub fared on till they came to his lodging where he talked
with her and said to her All thou seekest of me is ready for thee so
but thou wilt bring me to enjoy her Hubub replied Hearten thy
heart whereupon he rose and gave her an hundred dinars saying O
Hubub I have by me a dress worth an hundred gold pieces Answered she
O Masrur make haste with the trinkets and other things promised her
ere she change her mind for we may not take her save with wile and
guile and she loveth the saying of verse Quoth he Hearing and
obeying and bringing her the musk and ambergris and lignaloes and
rosewater returned with her to Zayn alMawasif and saluted her She
returned his salam with the sweetest speech and he was dazed by her
beauty and improvised these lines

 O thou sheeniest Sun who in night dost shine  O who stole my soul with
    those large black eyne
 O slimshaped fair with the graceful neck  O who shamest Rose wi
    those cheeks o thine
 Blind not our sight wi thy fell disdain  Disdain that shall load us
    with pain and pine
 Passion homes in our inmost nor will be quenched  The fire of yearning
    in vitals lien
 Your love has housd in heart of me  And of issue but you see I neer a
    sign
 Then haply youll pity this hapless wight  Thy sad lover and thenO the
    Morn divine

When Zayn alMawasif heard his verses she cast at him a glance of eyes
that bequeathed him a thousand regrets and sighs and his wits and soul
were ravished in such wise and answered him with these couplets

 Think not from her of whom thou art enamoured aye  To win delight so
    put desire from thee away
 Leave that thou hopst for gainst her rigours whom thou lovst  Among
    the fair in vain is all thou canst essay
 My looks to lovers bring discomfiture and woe  Indeed I make no count
    of that which thou dost say

When Masrur heard this he hardened his heart and took patience
concealing his case and saying in himself There is nothing for it
against calamity save longsuffering and after this fashion they abode
till nightfall when Zayn alMawasif called for food and they set before
her a tray wherein were all manner of dishes quails and pigeons and
mutton and so forth whereof they ate their sufficiency Then she bade
take away the tables and they did so and fetched the lavatory gear and
they washed their hands after which she ordered her women to bring the
candlesticks and they set on candelabra and candles therein of
camphorated wax Thereupon quoth Zayn alMawasif By Allah my breast
is straitened this night and I am afevered and quoth Masrur Allah
broaden thy breast and banish thy bane Then she said O Masrur I am
used to play at chess say me knowest aught of the game He replied
Yes I am skilled therein whereupon she commanded her handmaid Hubub
fetch her the chessboard So she went away and presently returning with
the board set it before her and behold it was of ivorymarquetried
ebony with squares marked in glittering gold and its pieces of pearl
and rubyAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her
permitted say


       Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Fortyseventh Night

She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Zayn
alMawasif bade the chessboard be brought they set it between her
hands and Masrur was amazed at this when she turned to him and said
Wilt have red or white He replied O Princess of the fair and
adornment of morning air do thou take the red for they formous are and
fitter for the like of thee to bear and leave the white to my care
Answered she So be it and taking the red pieces ranged them
opposite the white then put out her hand to a piece purposing the first
pass into the battleplain Masrur considered her fingers which were
white as paste and was confounded at their beauty and shapely shape
whereupon she turned to him and said O Masrur be not bedazed but
take patience and calm thyself He rejoined O thou whose beauty
shameth the moon how shall a lover look on thee and have
patienceboon And while this was doing she cried Checkmate
and beat him wherefore she knew that he was Jinnmad for love of her
and said to him O Masrur I will not play with thee save for a set
stake He replied I hear and obey and she rejoined Swear to me
and I will swear to thee that neither of us will cheat the
adversary So both sware this and she said O Masrur an I beat thee
I will have ten dinars of thee but an thou beat me I will give thee a
mere nothing He expected to win so he said O my lady be not false
to thine oath for I see thou art an overmatch for me at this game
Agreed said she and they ranged their men and fell again to playing
and pushing on their pawns and catching them up with the queens and
aligning and matching them with the castles and solacing them with the
onslaught of the knights Now the Adornment of Qualities wore on head
a kerchief of blue brocade so she loosed it off and tucking up her
sleeve showed a wrist like a shaft of light and passed her palm over
the red pieces saying to him Look to thyself But he was dazzled at
her beauty and the sight of her graces bereft him of reason so that he
became dazed and amazed and put out his hand to the white men but it
alit upon the red Said she O Masrur where be thy wits The red are
mine and the white thine and he replied Whoso looketh at thee
perforce loseth all his senses Then seeing how it was with him she
took the white from him and gave him the red and they played and she
beat him He ceased not to play with her and she to beat him whilst he
paid her each time ten dinars till knowing him to be distraught for
love of her she said O Masrur thou wilt never win to thy wish
except thou beat me for such was our understanding and henceforth I
will not play with thee save for a stake of an hundred dinars a game
With love and gladness answered he and she went on playing and ever
beating him and he paid her an hundred dinars each time and on this
wise they abode till the morning without his having won a single game
when he suddenly sprang to his feet Quoth she What wilt thou do O
Masrur and quoth he I mean to go to my lodging and fetch somewhat
of money it may be I shall come to my desire Do whatso seemeth good
to thee said she so he went home and taking all the money he had
returned to her improvising these two couplets

 In dream I saw a bird oer speed meseemd  Loves garden decked with
    blooms that smiled and gleamed
 But I shall ken when won my wish and will  Of thee the truthful sense
    of what I dreamed

Now when Masrur returned to her with all his monies they fell aplaying
again but she still beat him and he could not beat her once and in
such case they abode three days till she had gotten of him the whole of
his coin whereupon said she O Masrur what wilt thou do now and he
replied I will stake thee a druggists shop What is its worth
asked she and he answered Five hundred dinars So they played five
bouts and she won the shop of him Then he betted his slavegirls
lands houses gardens and she won the whole of them till she had
gotten of him all he had whereupon she turned to him and said Hast
thou aught left to lay down Cried he By Him who made me fall into
the snare of thy love I have neither money to touch nor aught else
left little or much She rejoined O Masrur the end of whatso began
in content shall not drive man to repent wherefore an thou regret
aught take back thy good and begone from us about thy business and I
will hold thee quit towards me Masrur rejoined By Him who decreed
these things to us though thou sought to take my life twere a wee
thing to stake for thine approof because I love none but thee Then
said she O Masrur fare forthright and fetch the Kazi and the
witnesses and make over to me by deed all thy lands and possessions
Willingly replied he and going forth without stay or delay brought
the Kazi and the witnesses and set them before her When the judge saw
her his wits fled and his mind was amazed and his reason was dazed for
the beauty of her fingers and he said to her O my lady I will not
write out the writ of conveyance save upon condition that thou buy the
lands and mansions and slavegirls and that they all pass under thy
control and into thy possession She rejoined Were agreed upon that
Write me a deed whereby all Masrurs houses and lands and slavegirls
and whatso his right hand possesseth shall pass to Zayn alMawasif and
become her property at such a price So the Kazi wrote out the writ and
the witnesses set hands thereto whereupon she took itAnd Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say


       Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Fortyeighth Night

She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Zayn
alMawasif took from the Kazi the deed which made over to her lovers
property she said to him O Masrur now gang thy gait But her
slavegirl Hubub turned to him and said Recite us some verses So he
improvised upon that game of chess these couplets

 Of Time and what befel me I complain  Mourning my loss by chess and
    eyes of bane
 For love of gentlest softestsided fair  Whose like is not of maids or
    mortal strain
 The shafts of glances from those eyne who shot  And led her conquering
    host to battleplain
 Red men and white men and the clashing Knights  And crying Look to
    thee came forth amain
 And when down charging fingertips she showed  That gloomed like
    blackest night for sable stain
 The Whites I could not rescue could not save  While ecstasy made
    tearfloods rail and rain
 The Pawns and Castles with their Queens fell low  And fled the Whites
    nor could the brunt sustain
 Yea with her shaft of glance at me she shot  And soon that shaft had
    pierced my heart and brain
 She gave me choice between her hosts and I  The Whites like moonlight
    first to choose was fain
 Saying This argent folk best fitteth me  I love them but the Red by
    thee be taen

 She playd me for free accepted stake  Yet amorous mercy I could neer
    obtain
 O fire of heart O pine and woe of me  Wooing a fair like moon mid
    starry train
 Burns no my heart O no nor aught regrets  Of good or land but ah her
    eyes disdain
 Amazed Im grown and dazed for drearihead  And blame I Time who brought
    such pine and pain
 Quoth she Why art thou so bedazed quoth I  Winedrunken wight
    shall more of wine assain
 That mortal stole my sense by silksoft shape  Which doth for
    heartcore hardest rock contain
 I nervd self and cried This day shes mine  By bet nor fear I
    prove she unhumne
 My heart neer ceased to seek possession till  Beggared I found me for
    conditions twain
 Will youth you loveth shun the Lovedealt blow  Tho were he whelmed
    in Loves highsurging main
 So woke the slave sans een a coin to turn  Thralled to repine for
    what he neer shall gain

Zayn alMawasif hearing these words marvelled at the eloquence of his
tongue and said to him O Masrur leave this madness and return to thy
right reason and wend thy ways for thou hast wasted all thy moveables
and immoveables at the chessgame yet hast not won thy wish nor hast
thou any resource or device whereby thou mayst attain to it But he
turned to her and said O my lady ask of me whatso thou wilt and thou
shalt have it for I will bring it to thee and lay it at thy feet
Answered she O Masrur thou hast no money left O goal of all hopes
if I have no money the folk will help me Shall the giver turn
asker I have friends and kinsfolk and whatsoever I seek of them
they will give me O Masrur I will have of thee four pods of musk and
four vases of civet and four pounds of ambergris and four thousand
dinars and four hundred pieces of royal brocade purfled with gold An
thou bring me these things O Masrur I will grant thee my favours
This is a light matter to me O thou that puttest the moons to shame
replied he and went forth to fetch her what she sought She sent her
maid Hubub after him to see what worth he had with the folk of whom he
had spoken to her but as he walked along the highways he turned and
seeing her afar off waited till she came up to him and said to her
Whither away O Hubub So she said to him My mistress sent me to
follow for this and that and he replied By Allah O Hubub I have
nothing to hand She asked Then why didst thou promise her and he
answered How many a promise made is unkept of its maker Fine words in
lovematters needs must be When she heard this from him she said O
Masrur be of good cheer and eyes clear for by Allah most assuredly I
will be the means of thy coming to enjoy her Then she left him nor
ceased walking till she stood before her mistress weeping with sore
weeping and said O my lady indeed he is a man of great
consideration and good repute among the folk Quoth Zayn alMawasif
There is no device against the destiny of Almighty Allah Verily this
man found not in me a pitiful heart for that I despoiled him of his
substance and he got of me neither affection nor complaisance in
granting him amorous joy but if I incline to his inclination I fear
lest the thing be bruited abroad Quoth Hubub O my lady verily
grievous upon us is his present plight and the loss of his good and thou
hast with thee none save thyself and thy slavegirl Sukub so which of
us two would dare prate of thee and we thy handmaids With this she
bowed her head for a while groundwards and the damsels said to her O
my lady it is our rede that thou send after him and show him grace and
suffer him not ask of the sordid for how bitter is such begging So
she accepted their counsel and calling for inkcase and paper wrote him
these couplets

 Joy is nigh O Masrr so rejoice in true rede  Whenas night shall
    fall thou shalt do kinddeed
 Crave not of the sordid a loan fair youth  Wine stole my wits but
    they now take heed
 All thy good I reft shall return to thee  O Masrr and Ill add to
    them amorous meed
 For indeed th art patient and sweet of soul  When wronged by thy
    lovers tyrannic greed
 So haste to enjoy us and luck to thee  Lest my folk come between us
    speed love all speed
 Hurry uswards thou nor delay and while  My mate is far on Loves
    fruit come feed

Then she folded the paper and gave it to Hubub the handmaid who carried
it to Masrur and found him weeping and reciting in a transport of
passion and lovelonging these lines

 A breeze of love on my soul did blow  That consumed my liver for stress
    of lowe
 When my sweetheart went all my longings grew  And with tears in
    torrent mine eyelids flow
 Such my doubt and fears did I tell their tale  To deaf rocks and
    pebbles theyd melt for woe
 Would Heaven I wot shall I sight delight  And shall win my wish and my
    friend shall know
 Shall be folded up nights that doomed us part  And I be healed of what
    harms my heart

And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her
permitted say


        Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Fortyninth Night

She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that while Masrur
transported by passion and lovelonging was repeating his couplets in
singsong tone Hubub knocked at his door so he rose and opened to her
and she entered and gave him the letter He read it and said to her O
Hubub what is behind thee of thy ladys news She answered O my
lord verily in this letter is that dispenseth me from reply for thou
art of those who readily descry Thereat he rejoiced with joy exceeding
and repeated these two couplets

 Came the writ whose contents a new joy revealed  Which in vitals mine
    I would keep ensealed
 And my longings grew when I kissed that writ  As were pearl of passion
    therein concealed

Then he wrote a letter answering hers and gave it to Hubub who wrote it
and returned with it to her mistress and forthright fell to extolling
his charms to her and expiating on his good gifts and generosity for
she was become a helper to him to bring about his union with her lady
Quoth Zayn alMawasif O Hubub indeed he tarrieth to come to us and
quoth Hubub He will certainly come soon Hardly had she made an end
of speaking when behold he knocked at the door and she opened to him
and brought him in to her mistress who saluted him with the salam
and welcomed him and seated him by her side Then she said to Hubub
Bring me a suit of brocade so she brought a robe broidered with gold
and Zayn alMawasif threw it over him whilst she herself donned one of
the richest dresses and crowned her head with a net of pearls of the
freshest water About this she bound a fillet of brocade purfled with
pearls jacinths and other jewels from beneath which she let down two
tresses each looped with a pendant of ruby charactered with
glittering gold and she loosed her hair as it were the sombrest night
and lastly she incensed herself with aloeswood and scented herself with
musk and ambergris and Hubub said to her Allah save thee from the
evil eye Then she began to walk swaying from side to side with
gracefullest gait whilst Hubub who excelled in versemaking recited in
her honour these couplets

 Shamed is the bough of Bn by pace of her  And harmed are lovers by
    the gaze of her
 A moon she rose from murks the hair of her  A sun from locks the brow
    encase of her
 Blest he she nights with by the grace of her  Who dies in her with
    oath by days of her

So Zayn alMawasif thanked her and went up to Masrur as she were full
moon displayed But when he saw her he rose to his feet and exclaimed
An my thought deceive me not she is no human but one of the brides of
Heaven Then she called for food and they brought a table about whose
marge were written these couplets

 Dip thou with spoons in saucers four and gladden heart and eye With many
    a various kind of stew and fricassee and fry
 Thereon fat quails neer shall I cease to love and tender them And
    rails and fowls and dainty birds of all the kinds that fly
 Glory to God for the Kabobs for redness all aglow And potherbs
    steeped in vinegar in porringers thereby

 Fair fall the rice with sweet milk dressed wherein the hands did plunge
    And eke the forearms of the fair were buried bracelethigh
 How my heart yearneth with regret over two plates of fish That by two
    manchetcakes of bread of Tewarij did lie

Then they ate and drank and made mirth and merriment after which the
servants removed the table of food and set on the wine service so cup
and tasse passed round between them and they were gladdened in
soul Then Masrur filled the cup and saying O whose thrall am I and
who is my mistress chanted these improvised couplets

 Mine eyes I admire that can feed their fill  On charms of a girl rising
    worlds to light
 In her time she hath none to compare for gifts  Of spirit and body a
    mere delight
 Her shape breeds envy in Cassiatree  When fares she forth in her
    symmetry dight
 With luminous brow shaming moon of dark  And crownlike crescent the
    brightest bright
 When treads she earth surface her fragrance scents  The Zephyr that
    breathes over plain and height

When he ended his extempore song she said O Masrur whoso religiously
keepeth his faith and hath eaten our bread and salt it behoveth us to
give him his due so put away from thee all thought of what hath been
and I will restore thee thy lands and houses and all we have taken from
thee He replied O my lady I acquit thee of that whereof thou
speakest though thou hadst been false to the oath and covenant between
us for I will go and become a Moslem Zayn alMawasif protested that
she would follow suit when Hubub cried to her O my lady thou art
young of years and knowest many things and I claim the intercession of
Almighty Allah with thee for except thou do my bidding and heal my
heart I will not lie the night with thee in the house And she
replied O Hubub it shall be as thou wilt Rise and make us ready
another sittingroom So she sprang to her feet and gat ready a room
and adorned and perfumed it after fairest fashion even as her lady loved
and preferred after which she again set on food and wine and the cup
went round between them and their hearts were gladAnd Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say


         Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Fiftieth Night

She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Zayn
alMawasif bade her maid Hubub make ready a private sittingroom she
arose and did her bidding after which she again set food and wine
before them and cup and tasse went round gladdening their hearts
Presently quoth Zayn alMawasif O Masrur come is the time of Union
and favour so as thou studiest my love to savour recite us some verses
surpassing of flavour Upon this he recited the following ode

       I am taken my heart burns with living flame
       For Union shorn whenas Severance came
       In the love of a damsel who forced my soul
       And with delicate cheeklet my reason stole
       She hath eyebrows united and eyes blackwhite
       And her teeth are leven that smiles in light
       The tale of her years is but ten plus four
       Tears like Dragons blood for her love I pour
       First I saw that face mid parterre and rill
       Outshining full Lune on horizonhill
       And stood like a captive for awe and cried
       Allahs Peace O who in demesne doth hide
       She returned my salam gaily answering
       With the sweetest speech likest pearls astring
       But when heard my words she right soon had known
       My want and her heart waxed hard as stone
       And quoth she Be not this a word sillybold
       But quoth I Refrain thee nor flyte and scold
       An today thou consent such affair were light
       Thy like is the loved mine the loverwight
       When she knew my mind she but smiled in mirth
       And cried Now by the Maker of Heaven and Earth
       Im a Jewess of Jewrys driest eer seen
       And thou art naught save a Nazarene
       Why seek my favours Thines other caste
       An this deed thou do thoult repent the past
       Say does Love allow with two Faiths to play
       Men shall blame thee like me at each break of day
       Wilt thou laugh at beliefs and deride their rite
       And in thine and mine prove thee sinful sprite
       An thou lovedest me thou hadst turnd Jew
       Losing worlds for love and my favours due
       And by the Evangel strong oath hadst sworn
       To keep our secret intact from scorn
       So I took the Torah and sware strong oath
       I would hold to the covenant made by both
       Then by law religion and creed I sware
       And bound her by oaths that most binding were
       And asked her Thy name O my dear delight
       And she Zayn alMawsif at home Im hight
       O Zayn alMawasif cried I Hear my call
       Thy love hath made me thy veriest thrall
       Then I peeped neath her chinveil and spied such charms
       That the longing of love filled my heart with qualms
       Neath the curtain I ceased not to humble me
       And complain of my heartfelt misery
       But when she saw me by Love beguiled
       She raised her faceveil and sweetly smiled
       And when breeze of Union our faces kissd
       With muskpod she scented fair neck and wrist
       And the house with her essences seemed to drip
       And I kissed pure wine from each smiling lip
       Then like branch of Bn neath her robe she swayed
       And joys erst unlawful she lawful made
       And joined conjoined through our night we lay
       With clip kiss of inner lip langue fourre
       The world hath no grace but the one loved fere
       In thine arms to clasp with possession sheer
       With the morn she rose and she bade Goodbye
       While her brow shone brighter than moon asky
       Reciting at parting while teardrops hung
       On her cheeks these scattered and other strung
       Allahs pact in mind all my life Ill bear
       And the lovely nights and strong oath I sware

Zayn alMawasif was delighted and said to him O Masrur how goodly are
thy inner gifts May he live not who would harm thy heart Then she
entered her boudoir and called him so he went in to her and taking her
in his arms embraced her and hugged her and kissed her and got of her
that which he had deemed impossible and rejoiced in winning the sweet of
amorous will Then said she O Masrur thy good is unlawful to me and
is lawfully thine again now that we are become lovers So she returned
to him all she had taken of him and asked him O Masrur hast thou a
flowergarden whither we may wend and take our pleasure whereto he
answered Yes O my lady I have a garden that hath not its like Then
he returned to his lodgings and bade his slavegirls make ready a
splendid banquet in a handsome room after which he summoned Zayn
alMawasif who came surrounded by her damsels and they ate and drank
and made mirth and merriment whilst the cup passed round between them
and their spirits rose high Then lover withdrew with beloved and Zayn
alMawasif said to Masrur I have bethought me of some dainty verses
which I would fain sing to the lute He replied Do sing them so she
took the lute and tuning it sang to a pleasant air these couplets

 Joy from stroke of string doth to me incline  And sweet is amorning
    our early wine
 Whenas Love unveileth the amourists heart  And by rending the veil he
    displays his sign
 With a draught so pure so dear so bright  As in hand of Moons
    the Suns sheeny shine
 O nights it cometh with joy to rase  The hoar of sorrow by boon
    divine

Then ending her verse she said to him O Masrur recite us somewhat of
thy poetry and favour us with the fruit of thy thought So he recited
these two couplets

 We joy in full Moon who the wine bears round  And in concert of lutes
    that from gardens sound
 Where the dove moans at dawn and where bends the bough  To Morn and
    all pathways of pleasure are found

When he had finished his recitation she said to him Make us some
verses on that which hath passed between us an thou be occupied with
love of meAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying
her permitted say


        Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Fiftyfirst Night

She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Zayn
alMawasif said to Masrur An thou be occupied with love of me make us
some verses on that hath passed between us With love and gladness
he replied and improvised the following Kasdah

 Stand thou and hear what fell to me  For love of you gazelle to dree
 Shot me a white doe with her shaft  O glances wounding woundily
 Love was my ruin for was I  Straitened by longing ecstasy
 I loved and wood a young coquette  Girded by strong artillery
 Whom in a garth I first beheld  A form whose sight was symmetry
 I greeted her and when she deigned  Greeting return Salm quoth she
 What be thy name said I she said  My name declares my
    quality
 Zayn alMawsif I am hight  Cried I Oh deign I mercy see
 Such is the longing in my heart  No lover claimeth rivalry
 Quoth she With me an thou rt in love  And to enjoy me pleadest plea
 I want of thee oh muchel wealth  Beyond all compt my wants o thee
 I want o thee full many a robe  Of sendal silk and damaskry
 A quarter quintal eke of musk  These of one night shall pay the fee
 Pearls unions and carnelianstones  The bestest best of
    jewelry
 Of fairest patience showed I show  In contrariety albe
 At last she favoured me one night  When rose the moon a crescent wee
 An stranger blame me for her sake  I say O blamers listen ye
 She showeth locks of goodly length  And black as blackest night its
    blee
 While on her cheeks the roses glow  Like Lazflame incendiary
 In every eyelash is a sword  And every glance hath archery
 Her liplets twain old wine contain  And dews of fountlike purity
 Her teeth resemble strings o pearls  Arrayed in line and fresh from
    sea
 Her neck is like the neck of doe  Pretty and carven perfectly
 Her bosom is a marble slab  Whence rise two breasts like towers on lea
 And on her stomach shows a crease  Perfumed with rich perfumery
 Beneath which same there lurks a Thing  Limit of mine expectancy

 A something rounded cushionedhigh  And plump my lords to high
    degree
 To me tis likest royal throne  Whither my longings wander free
 There twixt two pillars man shall find  Benches of highbuilt tracery
 It hath specific qualities  Drive sanest men t insanity
 Full mouth it hath like mouth of neck  Or well begirt by stony key
 Firm lips with camelrys compare  And shows it eye of cramoisie
 An draw thou nigh with doughty will  To do thy doing lustily
 Thoull find it fain to face thy bout  And strong and fierce in
    valiancy
 It bendeth backwards every brave  Shorn of his battlebravery
 At times imberbe but full of spunk  To battle with the Paynimry
 Twill show thee liveliness galore  And perfect in its raillery
 Zayn alMawasif it is like  Complete in charms and courtesy
 To her dear arms one night I came  And won meed given lawfully
 I passed with her that selfsame night  Best of my nights in
    gladdest glee
 And when the morning rose she rose  And crescent like her visnomy
 Then swayed her supple form as sway  The lances lopt from limber tree
 And when farewelling me she cried  When shall such nights return to
    me
 Then I replied O eyenlight  When He vouchsafeth His decree

Zayn alMawasif was delighted with this Ode and the utmost gladness gat
hold of her Then said she O Masrur daydawn draweth nigh and there is
naught for it save to fly for fear of scandal and spy He replied I
hear and obey and rising led her to her lodging after which he
returned to his quarters and passed the rest of the night pondering
on her charms When the morning morrowed with its sheen and shone he
made ready a splendid present and carried it to her and sat by her side
And thus they abode awhile in all solace of life and its delight till
one day there came to Zayn alMawasif a letter from her husband
reporting to her his speedy return Thereupon she said in herself May
Allah not keep him nor quicken him If he come hither our life will be
troubled would Heaven I might despair of him Presently entered Masrur
and sat with her at chat as was his wont whereupon she said to him O
Masrur I have received a missive from my mate announcing his speedy
return from his wayfaring What is to be done since neither of us
without other can live He replied I know not but thou art better
able to judge being acquainted with the ways of thy man more by token
that thou art one of the sharpestwitted of women and past mistress of
devices such as devise that whereof fail the wise Quoth she He is a
hard man and jealous of his household but when he shall come home and
thou hearest of his coming do thou repair to him and salute him and sit
down by his side sayingO my brother I am a druggist Then buy of him
somewhat of drugs and spices of sorts and call upon him frequently and
prolong thy talks with him and gainsay him not in whatsoever he shall
bid thee so haply that I would contrive may betide as it were by
chance I hear and I obey quoth Masrur and fared forth from her
with heart afire for love When her husband came home she rejoiced in
meeting him and after saluting him bade him welcome but he looked in
her face and seeing it pale and sallow for she had washed it with
saffron using one of womens arts asked her of her case She answered
that she had been sick she and her women from the time of his
wayfaring adding Verily our hearts have been engrossed with thoughts
of thee because of the length of thine absence And she went on to
complain to him of the misery of separation and to pour forth copious
tears saying Hadst thou but a companion with thee my heart had not
borne all this cark and care for thee So Allah upon thee O my lord
travel not again without a comrade and cut me not off from news of thee
that my heart and mind may be at rest concerning theeAnd Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say


       Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Fiftysecond Night

She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Zayn
alMawasif said to her mate Travel not without comrade and cut me not
off from news of thee that my heart and mind may be at rest concerning
thee he replied With love and gladness By Allah thy bede is good
indeed and right is thy rede By thy life it shall be as thou dost
heed Then he unpacked some of his stockintrade and carrying the
goods to his shop opened it and sat down to sell in the Soko No
sooner had he taken his place than lo and behold up came Masrur and
saluting him sat down by his side and began talking and talked with him
awhile Then he pulled out a purse and taking forth gold handed it to
Zayn alMawasifs man and said Give me the worth of these dinars in
drugs and spices of sorts that I may sell them in my shop The Jew
replied I hear and I obey and gave him what he sought And Masrur
continued to pay him frequent visits till one day the merchant said to
him I have a mind to take me a man to partner in trade Quoth Masrur
And I also desire to take a partner for my father was a merchant in
the land of AlYaman and left me great store of money and I fear lest it
fare from me Quoth the Jew turning towards him Wilt thou be my
partner and I will be thy partner and a true friend and comrade to thee
at home and abroad and I will teach thee selling and buying giving and
taking And Masrur rejoined With all my heart So the merchant
carried him to his place and seated him in the vestibule whilst he went
in to his wife and said to her I have provided me with a partner and
have bidden him hither as a guest so do thou get us ready good
guestcheer Whenas she heard this she rejoiced divining that it was
Masrur and made ready a magnificent banquet of her delight in the
success of her device Then when the guest drew nigh her husband said
to her Come out with me to him and bid him welcome and say Thou
gladdenest us But Zayn alMawasif made a show of anger crying
Wilt thou have me display myself before a strange man I take refuge
with Allah Though thou cut me to bits I will not appear before him
Rejoined he Why shouldst thou be abashed at him seeing that he is a
Nazarene and we are Jews and to boot we are become chums he and I
Quoth she I am not minded to present myself before a strange man on
whom I have never once set eyes and whom I know not any wise Her
husband thought she spoke sooth and ceased not to importune her till
she rose and veiling herself took the food and went out to Masrur and
welcomed him whereupon he bowed his head groundwards as he were
ashamed and the Jew seeing such dejection said in himself Doubtless
this man is a devotee They ate their fill and the table being removed
wine was set on As for Zayn alMawasif she sat over against Masrur and
gazed on him and he gazed on her till ended day when he went home with
a heart to fire a prey But the Jew abode pondering the grace and the
comeliness of him and as soon as it was night his wife according to
custom served him with supper and they seated themselves before it Now
he had a mockingbird which was wont whenever he sat down to meat to
come and eat with him and hover over his head but in his absence the
fowl was grown familiar with Masrur and used to flutter about him as he
sat at meals Now when Masrur disappeared and the master returned it
knew him not and would not draw near him and this made him thoughtful
concerning his case and the fowls withdrawing from him As for Zayn
alMawasif she could not sleep with her heart thinking of Masrur and
thus it was with her a second and even a third night till the Jew
became aware of her condition and watching her while she sat
distraught began to suspect somewhat wrong On the fourth night he
awoke in the middle thereof and heard his wife babbling in her sleep and
naming Masrur what while she lay on her husbands bosom wherefore he
misdoubted her but he dissembled his suspicions and when morning
morrowed he repaired to his shop and sat therein Presently up came
Masrur and saluted him He returned his salam and said to him Welcome
O my brother adding anon I have wished for thee and he sat talking
with him for an hour or so after which he said to him Rise O my
brother and hie with me to my house that we may enter into the pact of
brotherhood Replied Masrur With joy and goodly gree and they
repaired to the Jews house where the master went in and told his wife
of Masrurs visit for the purpose of conditioning their partnership
and said Make us ready a goodly entertainment and needs must thou be
present and witness our brotherhood But she replied Allah upon thee
cause me not show myself to this strange man for I have no mind to
company with him So he held his peace and forbore to press her and
bade the waitingwomen bring food and drink Then he called the
mockingbird but it knew not its lord and settled upon Masrurs lap and
the Jew said to him O my master what is thy name He answered My
name is Masrur whereupon the Jew remembered that this was the name
which his wife had repeated all night long in her sleep Presently he
raised his head and saw her making signs with her forefingers to
Masrur and motioning to him with her eyes wherefore he knew that he had
been completely cozened and cuckolded and said O my lord excuse me
awhile till I fetch my kinsmen so they may be present at our swearing
brotherhood Quoth Masrur Do what seemeth good to thee whereupon
the Jew went forth the house and returning privily by a back wayAnd
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say


        Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Fiftythird Night

She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that Zayn
alMawasifs husband said to Masrur Excuse me awhile till I fetch my
cousins to witness the brotherbond between me and thee Then he went
forth and privily returning behind the sittingroom there took his
station hard by a window which gave upon the saloon and whence he could
watch them without their seeing him Suddenly quoth Zayn alMawasif to
her maid Sukub Whither is thy master gone and quoth she He is
gone without the house Cried the mistress Lock the door and bar it
with iron and open thou not till he knock after thou hast told me
Answered Sukub So shall it be done Then while her husband watched
them she rose and filling a cup with wine flavoured with powdered musk
and rosewater went close to Masrur who sprang up to meet her saying
By Allah the water of thy mouth is sweeter than this wine Here it
is for thee said she and filling her mouth with wine gave him to
drink thereof whilst he gave her the like to drink after which she
sprinkled him with rosewater from front to foot till the perfume
scented the whole place All this while the Jew was looking on and
marvelling at the stress of love that was between them and his heart
was filled with fury for what he saw and he was not only wroth but
jealous with exceeding jealousy Then he went out again and coming to
the door found it locked and knocked a loud knock of the excess of his
rage whereupon quoth Sukub O my lady here is my master and quoth
Zayn alMawasif Open to him would that Allah had not brought him back
in safety So Sukub went and opened the door to the Jew who said to
her What ailed thee to lock the door Quoth she It hath never
ceased to be locked thus during thine absence nor hath it been opened
night nor day and cried he Thou hast done well this pleaseth me
Then he went in to Masrur laughing and dissembling his chagrin and
said to him O Masrur let us put off the conclusion of our pact of
brotherhood this day and defer it to another Replied Masrur As thou
wilt and hied him home leaving the Jew pondering his case and knowing
not what to do for his heart was sore troubled and he said in himself
Even the mockingbird disowneth me and the slavegirls shut the door in
my face and favour another And of his exceeding chagrin he fell to
reciting these couplets

 Masrur joys life made fair by all delight of days  Fulfilled of boons
    while mine the sorest grief displays
 The Days have falsed me in the breast of her I love  And in my heart
    are fires which allconsuming blaze
 Yea Time was clear for thee but now tis past and gone  While yet her
    lovely charms thy wit and senses daze
 Espied these eyes of mine her gifts of loveliness  Oh hard my case
    and sore my woe on spirit weighs
 I saw the maiden of the tribe deal rich old wine  Of lips like Salsabl
    to friend my love betrays
 Een so O mockingbird thou dost betray my breast  And to a rival
    teachest Love and loverways
 Strange things indeed and wondrous saw these eyne of me  Which were
    they sleepdrowned still from Sleeps abyss would raise
 I see my best belovd hath forsworn my love  And eke like my
    mockingbird fro me astartled strays
 By truth of Allah Lord of Worlds who whatso wills  His Fate for
    creatures works and none His hest gainsays
 Forsure Ill deal to that ungodly wight his due  Who but to sate his
    wicked will her heart withdrew

When Zayn alMawasif heard this her sidemuscles trembled and quoth she
to her handmaid Heardest thou those lines whereupon quoth the girl
I never heard him in my born days recite the like of these verses but
let him say what he will Then having assured himself of the truth of
his suspicions the Jew began to sell all his property saying to
himself Unless I part them by removing her from her mother land the
twain will not turn back from this that they are engaged in no never
So when he had converted all his possessions into coin he forged a
letter and read it to Zayn alMawasif declaring that it had come from
his kinsmen who invited him to visit them him and his wife She asked
How long shall we tarry with them and he answered Twelve days
Accordingly she consented to this and said Shall I take any of my
maids with me whereto he replied Take Hubub and Sukub and leave
Khutub here Then he made ready a handsome camellitter for his
spouse and her women and prepared to set out with them whilst she sent
to her leman telling him what had betided her and saying O Masrur an
the trystingtime that is between us pass and I come not back know
that he hath cheated and cozened us and planned a plot to separate us
each from other so forget thou not the plighted faith betwixt us for I
fear that he hath found out our love and I dread his craft and perfidy
Then whilst her man was busy about his march she fell aweeping and
lamenting and no peace was left her night or day Her husband saw this
but took no note thereof and when she saw there was scant help for it
she gathered together her clothes and gear and deposited them with her
sister telling her what had befallen her Then she farewelled her and
going out from her drowned in tears returned to her own house where
she found her husband had brought the camels and was busy loading them
having set apart the handsomest dromedary for her riding and when she
saw this and knew that needs must she be separated from Masrur she waxt
clean distraught Presently it chanced that the Jew went out on some
business of his so she fared forth to the first or outer door and wrote
thereon these coupletsAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased to say her permitted say


       Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Fiftyfourth Night

She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Zayn
alMawasif saw her spouse summon the camels and knew that the march
needs must be she waxt clean distraught Presently it chanced that the
Jew went out on some business so she fared forth to the first door and
wrote thereon these couplets

 Bear our salams O Dove from this our stead  From lover to beloved far
    severd
 Bid him fro me neer cease to yearn and mourn  Oer happy days and
    hours for ever fled
 Eke I in grief shall ever mourn and yearn  Dwelling on days of love
    and lustihead
 Long was our joyance seeming aye to last  When night and morning to
    reunion led
 Till croaked the Raven of the Wold one day  His cursed croak and
    did our union dead
 We sped and left the homestead dark and void  Its gates unpeopled and
    its dwellers sped

Then she went to the second door and wrote thereon these couplets

 O who passest this doorway by Allah see  The charms of my fere in the
    glooms and make plea
 For me saying I think of the Past and weep  Yet boot me no tears
    flowing full and free
 Say An fail thee patience for what befel  Scatter earth and dust on
    the head of thee
 And oer travel lands East and West and deem  God sufficeth thy case
    so bear patiently

Then she went to the third door and wept sore and thereon wrote these
couplets

 Fare softly Masrr an her sanctuary  Thou seek and read what adoor
    writ she
 Neer forget Loveplight if true man how oft  Hast savoured Nights
    bitter and sweetest gree
 O Masrr forget not her neighbourhood  For wi thee must her gladness
    and joyance flee
 But beweep those dearest united days  When thou camest veild in
    secresy
 Wend for sake of us over farthest wone  Span the wold for us for us
    dive in sea
 Allah bless the past days Ah how glad they were  When in Gardens of
    Fancy the flowers pluckt we
 The nights of Union from us are fled  And partingglooms dim their
    radiancy
 Ah had this lasted as hopd we but  He left only our breasts and the
    rosery
 Will revolving days on Reunion dawn  Then our vow to the Lord shall
    accomplisht be
 Learn thou our lots are in hand of Him  Who on lines of skull
    writes our destiny

Then she wept with sore weeping and returned to the house wailing and
remembering what had passed and saying Glory be to God who hath
decreed to us this And her affliction redoubled for severance from her
beloved and her departure from her motherland and she recited these
couplets

 Allahs peace on thee House of Vacancy  Ceased in thee all our joys
    all our jubilee
 O thou Dove of the homestead neer cease to bemoan  Whose moons and
    full moons sorest severance dree
 Masrr fare softly and mourn our loss  Loving thee our eyes lose
    their brilliancy
 Would thy sight had seen on our marching day  Tears shed by a heart
    in Hells flagrancy
 Forget not the plight in the garthshade pledged  When we set enveild
    in privacy

Then she presented herself before her husband who lifted her into the
litter he had let make for her and when she found herself on the
camels back she recited these couplets

 The Lord empty House to thee peace decree  Long we bore therein
    growth of misery
 Would my lifethread were shorn in that safe abode  And o night I had
    died in mine ecstasy
 Homesickness I mourn and my strangerhood  Irks my soul nor the
    riddle of future I ree
 Would I wot shall I ever that house resee  And find it as erst home
    of joy and glee

Said her husband O Zayn alMawasif grieve not for thy departure from
thy dwelling for thou shalt return to it ere long Inshallah And he
went on to comfort her heart and soothe her sorrow Then all set out and
fared on till they came without the town and struck into the high road
whereupon she knew that separation was certain and this was very
grievous to her And while such things happened Masrur sat in his
quarters pondering his case and that of his mistress and his heart
forewarned him of severance So he rose without stay and delay and
repairing to her house found the outer door padlocked and read the
couplets she had written thereon upon which he fell down in a fainting
fit When he came to himself he opened the first door and entering
read what was written upon the second and likewise upon the third doors
wherefore passion and lovelonging and distraction grew on him So he
went forth and hastened in her track till he came up with the light
caravan and found her at the rear whilst her husband rode in the
van because of his merchandise When he saw her he clung to the
litter weeping and wailing for the anguish of parting and recited
these couplets

 Would I wot for what crime shot and pierced are we  Thro the days with
    Estrangements archery
 O my hearts desire to thy door I came  One day when high waxt mine
    expectancy
 But I found the home waste as the wold and void  And I plained my pine
    and groaned wretchedly
 And I asked the walls of my friends who fared  With my heart in pawn
    and in pendency

 And they said All marched from the camp and left  An ambushed sorrow
    on hill and lea
 And a writ on the walls did they write as write  Folk who keep their
    faith while the Worlds are three

Now when Zayn alMawasif heard these lines she knew that it was
MasrurAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her
permitted say


        Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Fiftyfifth Night

She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Zayn
alMawasif heard these lines she knew that it was Masrur and wept she
and her handmaids and said to him O Masrur I conjure thee by Allah
turn back lest my husband see us twain together At her words he
swooned away and when he revived they took leave each of other and he
recited the following couplets

 The Caravanchief calleth loud o night  Ere the Breeze bear his cry in
    the morninglight
 They girded their loads and prepared to fare  And hurried while
    murmured the leaderwight
 They scent the scene on its every side  As their march through the
    valley they expedite
 After winning my heart by their love they went  O morn when their
    track could deceive my sight
 O my neighbour fair I reckt neer to part  Or the ground bedewed with
    my tears to sight
 Woe betide my heart now hath Severance hand  To heart and vitals dealt
    bane and blight

Then he clung to the litter weeping and wailing whilst she besought
him to turn back ere morn for fear of scorn So he came up to her Haudaj
and farewelling her a second time fell down in a swoon He lay an hour
or so without life and when he revived he found the caravan had fared
forth of sight So he turned in the direction of their wayfare and
scenting the breeze which blew from their quarter chanted these
improvised lines

 No breeze of Union to the lover blows  But moan he maketh burnt with
    fiery woes
 The Zephyr fans him at the dawn o day  But when he wakes the horizon
    lonely shows

 On bed of sickness strewn in pain he lies  And weeps he bloody tears
    in burning throes
 For the fair neighbour with my heart they bore  Mid travellers urging
    beasts with cries and blows
 By Allah from their stead no Zephyr blew  But sniffed I as the wight on
    eyeballs goes
 And snuff the sweetest South as musk it breathes  And on the longing
    lover scent bestows

Then Masrur returned mad with lovelonging to her house and finding
it lone from end to end and forlorn of friend wept till he wet his
clothes after which he swooned away and his soul was like to leave his
body When he revived he recited these two couplets

 O Springcamp have ruth on mine overthrowing  My abjection my
    leanness my tears aye flowing
 Waft the scented powder of breezes they breathe  In hope it cure
    heart of a grief eer growing

Then he returned to his own lodging confounded and tearfuleyed and
abode there for the space of ten days Such was his case but as regards
the Jew he journeyed on with Zayn alMawasif half a score days at the
end of which he halted at a certain city and she being by that time
assured that her husband had played her false wrote to Masrur a letter
and gave it to Hubub saying Send this to Masrur so he may know how
foully and fully we have been tricked and how the Jew hath cheated us
So Hubub took it and despatched it to Masrur and when it reached its
news was grievous to him and he wept till he watered the ground Then he
wrote a reply and sent it to his mistress subscribing it with these two
couplets

 Where is the way to Consolations door  How shall console him flames
    burn evermore
 How pleasant were the days of yore all gone  Would we had somewhat of
    those days of yore

When the missive reached Zayn alMawasif she read it and again gave it
to her handmaid Hubub saying to her Keep it secret However the
husband came to know of their correspondence and removed with her and
her two women to another city at a distance of twenty days march Thus
it befel Zayn alMawasif but as regards Masrur sleep was not sweet to
him nor was peace peaceful to him or patience left to him and he ceased
not to be thus till one night his eyes closed for weariness and he
dreamt that he saw Zayn alMawasif come to him in the garden and embrace
him but presently he awoke and found her not whereupon his reason fled
and his wits wandered and his eyes ran over with tears lovelonging to
the utterest gat hold of his heart and he recited these couplets

 Peace be to her who visits me in sleeping phantasy  Stirring desire
    and growing love to uttermost degree
 Verily from that dream I rose with passion maddend  For sight of
    fairest phantom come in peace to visit me
 Say me can dreams declare the truth anent the maid I love  And quench
    the fires of thirst and heal my lovesick malady
 Anon to me she is liberal and she strains me to her breast  Anon she
    soothes mine anxious heart with sweetest pleasantry
 From off her darkred damask lips the dew I wont to sip  The fine old
    wine that seemed to reek of musks perfumery
 I wondered at the wondrous things between us done in dreams  And won
    my wish and all my will of things I hoped to see
 And from that dreamery I rose yet neer could hope to find  Trace of
    my phantom save my pain and fiery misery
 And when I looked on her amorn twas as a lover mad  And every eve
    was drunken yet no wine brought jollity
 O breathings of the northern breeze by Allah fro me bear  Themwards
    the greetings of my love and best salams that be
 Say them The wight with whom ye made that plight of fealty  Time with
    his changes made him drain Deaths cup and slain is he

Then he went out and ceased not to weep till he came to her house and
looking on it saw it empty and void Presently it seemed to him he
beheld her form before him whereupon fires flamed in him and his griefs
redoubled and he fell down aswoonAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of
day and ceased to say her permitted say


        Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Fiftysixth Night

She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Masrur
saw the vision of Zayn alMawasif and felt her embrace he joyed with
passing joy As soon as he awoke he sought her house but finding it
empty and void he fell down aswoon and when he came to himself he
recited these couplets

 Fro them inhale I scent of Ottar and of Bn  So fare with heart which
    ecstasies of love unman
 Id heal thy longings lovesick lover by return  To site of beauty
    void sans friend or mate to scan
 But still it sickeneth me with partings ban and bane  Minding mine
    olden plight with friend and partisan

When he had made an end of these verses he heard a raven croak beside
the house and wept saying Glory be to God The raven croaketh not
save over a ruined homestead Then he moaned and groaned and recited
these couplets

 What ails the Raven that he croaks my lovers house hard by  And in my
    vitals lights a fire that flameth fierce and high
 For times now past and gone I spent in joyance of their love  With love
    my heart hath gone to waste and I sore pain aby
 I die of longing love and lowe still in my liver raging  And wrote to
    her but none there is who with the writ may hie
 Ah wellaway for wasted frame Hath fard forth my friend  And if she
    will o nights return Oh would that thing wot I
 Then Ho thou Breeze of East and thou by morn eer visit her  Greet
    her from me and stand where doth her tribe encampd lie

Now Zayn alMawasif had a sister by name Nasmthe Zephyrwho stood
espying him from a high place and when she saw him in this plight she
wept and sighed and recited these couplets

 How oft bewailing the place shall be this coming and going  While the
    House bemoaneth its builder with tearflood ever aflowing
 Here was bestest joy ere fared my friend with the caravan hieing  And
    its dwellers and brightestsuns neer ceased in its walls
    aglowing
 Where be those fullest moons that here were alway arising  Bedimmed
    them the Shafts of Days their charms of spirit unknowing

 Leave then what is past of the Fair thou wast ever with love espying 
    And look for haply the days may restore them without foreshowing
 For hadst thou not been its dwellers had never departed flying  Nor
    haddest thou seen the Crow with illomened croak acrying

Masrur wept sore hearing these verses and apprehending their
significance Now Nasim knew that which was between him and her sister
of love and longing ecstasy and passion so she said to him Allah
upon thee O Masrur away from this house lest any see thee and deem
thou comest on my account Indeed thou hast caused my sister quit it and
now thou wouldst drive me also away Thou knowest that but for thee
the house would not now be void of its dwellers so be consoled for her
loss and leave her what is past is past When he heard this he wept
bitterly and said to her O Nasim if I could I should fly for longing
after her so how can I be comforted for her Quoth she Thou hast no
device save patience and quoth he I beseech thee for Allahs sake
write me a writ to her as from thyself and get me an answer from her
to comfort my heart and quench the fire in my vitals She replied
With love and gladness and took inkcase and paper whilst Masrur
began to set out to her the violence of his longing and what tortures he
suffered for the anguish of severance sayingThis letter is from the
lover despairing and sorrowful  the bereaved the woeful  with whom no
peace can stay  nor by night nor by day  but he weepeth copious tears
alway  Indeed tears his eyelids have ulcerated and his sorrows have
kindled in his liver a fire unsated His lamentation is lengthened and
restlessness is strengthened and he is as he were a bird unmated  While
for sudden death he awaiteth  Alas my desolation for the loss of thee
 and alas my yearning affliction for the companionship of thee 
Indeed emaciation hath wasted my frame  and my tears a torrent became
 mountains and plains are straitened upon me for grame  and of the
excess of my distress I go saying

 Still cleaves to this homestead mine ecstasy  And redoubled pine for
    its dwellers I dree
 And I send to your quarters the tale of my love  And the cup of your
    love gave the Cupboy to me
 And for faring of you and your farness from home  My wounded lids are
    from tears neer free
 O thou leader of litters turn back with my love  For my heart
    redoubleth its ardency

 Greet my love and say him that naught except  Those brownred lips
    deals me remedy
 They bore him away and our union rent  And my vitals with
    Severanceshaft shot he
 My love my lowe and my longing to him  Convey for of parting no cure
    I see
 I swear an oath by your love that I  Will keep pact and covenant
    faithfully
 To none Ill incline or forget your love  How shall lovesick lover
    forgetful be
 So with you be the peace and my greeting fair  In letters that perfume
    of muskpod bear

Her sister Nasim admired his eloquence of tongue and the goodliness of
his speech and the elegance of the verses he sang and was moved to ruth
for him So she sealed the letter with virgin musk and incensed it with
Naddscent and ambergris after which she committed it to a certain of
the merchants saying Deliver it not to any save to Zayn alMawasif or
to her handmaid Hubub Now when the letter reached her sister she knew
it for Masrurs dictation and recognised himself in the grace of its
expression So she kissed it and laid it on her eyes whilst the tears
streamed from her lids and she gave not over weeping till she fainted
As soon as she came to herself she called for pencase and paper and
wrote him the following answer complaining the while of her desire and
lovelonging and ecstasy and what was hers to endure of pining for her
lover and yearning to him and the passion she had conceived for
himAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her
permitted say


       Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Fiftyseventh Night

She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that Zayn alMawasif
wrote the following reply to Masrurs missiveThis letter to my lord
and master I indite  the king of my heart and my secret sprite 
Indeed wakefulness agitateth me  and melancholy increaseth on me  and
I have no patience to endure the absence of thee  O thou who excellest
sun and moon in brilliancy  Desire of repose despoileth me  and
passion destroyeth me  and how should it be otherwise with me seeing
that I am of the number of the dying  O glory of the world and
Ornament of life she whose vital spirits are cut off shall her cup be
sweet to quaff  For that she is neither with the quick nor with the
dead And she improvised these couplets and said

 Thy writ O Masrr stirred my sprite to pine  For by Allah all
    patience and solace I tyne
 When I read thy scripture my vitals yearned  And watered the herbs of
    the wold these eyne
 On Nights wings Id fly an a bird  And sans thee I weet not the sweets
    of wine
 Lifes unlawful to me since thou faredst far  To bear partinglowe is
    no force of mine

Then she sprinkled the letter with powder of musk and ambergris and
having sealed it with her signet committed it to a merchant saying
Deliver it to none save to my sister When it reached Nasim she sent
it to Masrur who kissed it and laid it on his eyes and wept till he
fell into a trance Such was their case but as regards the Jew he
presently heard of their correspondence and began again to travel from
place to place with Zayn alMawasif and her damsels till she said to
him Glory to God How long wilt thou fare with us and bear us afar
from our homes Quoth he I will fare on with you a years journey so
no more letters may reach you from Masrur I see how you take all my
monies and give them to him so all that I miss I shall recover from
you and I shall see if Masrur will profit you or have power to deliver
you from my hand Then he repaired to a blacksmith after stripping her
and her damsels of their silken apparel and clothing them in raiment of
haircloth and bade him make three pairs of iron shackles When they
were ready he brought the smith in to his wife having said to him
Put the shackles on the legs of these three slavegirls The first
that came forward was Zayn alMawasif and when the blacksmith saw her
his sense forsook him and he bit his finger tips and his wit fled forth
his head and his transport grew sore upon him So he said to the Jew
What is the crime of these damsels Replied the other They are my
slavegirls and have stolen my good and fled from me Cried the smith
Allah disappoint thy jealous whims By the Almighty were this girl
before the Kazi of Kazis he would not even reprove her though she
committed a thousand crimes a day Indeed she showeth not thiefs
favour and she cannot brook the laying of irons on her legs And he
asked him as a boon not to fetter her interceding with him to forbear
the shackles When she saw the blacksmith taking her part in this wise
she said to her husband I conjure thee by Allah bring me not forth
before yonder strange man Said he Why then camest thou forth before
Masrur and she made him no reply Then he accepted the smiths
intercession so far as to allow him to put a light pair of irons on her
legs for that she had a delicate body which might not brook harsh
usage whilst he laid her handmaids in heavy bilboes and they ceased
not all three to wear haircloth night and day till their bodies
became wasted and their colour changed As for the blacksmith exceeding
love had fallen on his heart for Zayn alMawasif so he returned home in
great concern and he fell to reciting extempore these couplets

 Wither thy right O smith which made her bear  Those iron chains her
    hands and feet to wear
 Thou hast ensoiled a lady soft and bright  Marvel of marvels fairest
    of the fair
 Hadst thou been just those anklets neer had been  Of iron nay of
    purest gold they were
 By Allah did the Kzis Kzi sight  Her charms hed seat her in the
    highest chair

Now it chanced that the Kazi of Kazis passed by the smiths house and
heard him improvise these lines so he sent for him and as soon as he
saw him said to him O blacksmith who is she on whom thou callest so
instantly an eloquently and with whose love thy heart is full filled
The smith sprang to his feet and kissing the Judges hand answered
Allah prolong the days of our lord the Kazi and ample his life Then
he described to him Zayn alMawasifs beauty and loveliness brilliancy
and perfection and symmetry and grace and how she was lovely faced and
had a slender waist and heavily based and acquainted him with the sorry
plight wherein she was for abasement and durance vile and lack of
victual When the Kazi heard this he said O blacksmith send her to
us and show her that we may do her justice for thou art become
accountable for the damsel and unless thou guide her to us Allah will
punish thee at the Day of Doom I hear and obey replied the smith
and betook himself without stay and delay to Zayn alMawasifs lodging
but found the door barred and heard a voice of plaintive tone that came
from heart forlorn and lone and it was Zayn alMawasif reciting these
couplets

 I and my love in union were unite  And filled my friend to me cups
    clearly bright
 Between us reigned high mirth and jollity  Nor Eve nor Morn brought
    noyance or affright
 Indeed we spent most joyous time with cup  And lute and dulcimer to
    add delight
 Till Time estranged our fair companionship  My lover went and blessing
    turned to blight
 Ah would the Severanceravens croak were stilled  And Uniondawn of
    Love show blessd light

When the blacksmith heard this he wept like the weeping of the clouds
Then he knocked at the door and the women said Who is at the door
Answered he Tis I the blacksmith and told them what the Kazi had
said and how he would have them appear before him and make their
complaint to him that he might do them justice on their adversaryAnd
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say


       Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Fiftyeighth Night

She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the
blacksmith told Zayn alMawasif what the Kazi had said and how he
summoned them that he might apply the Lex Talionis to their adversary
she rejoined How can we go to him seeing the door is locked on us and
our feet shackled and the Jew hath the keys The smith replied I will
make the keys for the padlocks and therewith open door and shackles
Asked she But who will show us the Kazis house and he answered I
will describe it to you She enquired But how can we appear before
him clad as we are in haircloth reeking with sulphur And the smith
rejoined The Kazi will not reproach this to you considering your
case So saying he went forthright and made keys for the padlocks
wherewith he opened the door and the shackles and loosing the irons
from their legs carried them forth and guided them to the Kazis
mansion Then Hubub did off the haircloth garments from her ladys body
and carried her to the Hammam where she bathed her and attired her in
silken raiment and her colour returned to her Now it happened by
exceeding good fortune that her husband was abroad at a bridefeast in
the house of one of the merchants so Zayn alMawasif the Adornment of
Qualities adorned herself with the fairest ornaments and repaired to
the Kazi who at once on espying her rose to receive her She saluted
him with softest speech and winsomest words shooting him through the
vitals the while with the shafts of her glances and said May Allah
prolong the life of our lord the Kazi and strengthen him to judge
between man and man Then she acquainted him with the affair of the
blacksmith and how he had done nobly by them whenas the Jew had
inflicted on her and her women heartconfounding torments and how his
victims deathwards he drave nor was there any found to save O
damsel quoth the Kazi what is thy name My name is Zayn
alMawasifAdornment of Qualitiesand this my handmaids name is
Hubub Thy name accordeth with the named and its sound conformeth with
its sense Whereupon she smiled and veiled her face and he said to
her O Zayn alMawasif hast thou a husband or not I have no
husband And what is thy Faith That of AlIslam and the religion
of the Best of Men Swear to me by Holy Law replete with signs and
instances that thou ownest the creed of the Best of Mankind So she
swore to him and pronounced the profession of the Faith Then asked the
Kazi How cometh it that thou wastest thy youth with this Jew And she
answered Know O Kazi may Allah prolong thy days in contentment and
bring thee to thy will and thine acts with benefits seal that my
father left me after his death fifteen thousand dinars which he
placed in the hands of this Jew that he might trade therewith and share
his gains with me the head of the property being secured by legal
acknowledgment When my father died the Jew coveted me and sought me in
marriage of my mother who saidHow shall I drive her from her Faith
and cause to become a Jewess By Allah I will denounce thee to the
rulers He was affrighted at her words and taking the money fled to the
town of Adan When we heard where he was we came to Adan in search
of him and when we foregathered with him there he told us that he was
trading in stuffs with the monies and buying goods upon goods So we
believed him and he ceased not to cozen us till he cast us into jail and
fettered us and tortured us with exceeding sore torments and we are
strangers in the land and have no helper save Almighty Allah and our
lord the Kazi When the Judge heard this tale he asked Hubub the nurse
Is this indeed thy lady and are ye strangers and is she unmarried
and she answered Yes Quoth he Marry her to me and on me be
incumbent manumission of my slaves and fasting and pilgrimage and
almsgiving of all my good an I do you not justice on this dog and punish
him for that he hath done And quoth she I hear and obey Then said
the Kazi Go hearten thy heart and that of thy lady and tomorrow
Inshallah I will send for this Miscreant and do you justice on him and
ye shall see prodigies of his punishment So Hubub called down
blessings upon him and went forth from him with her mistress leaving
him with passion and lovelonging fraught and with distress and desire
distraught Then they enquired for the house of the second Kazi and
presenting themselves before him told him the same tale On like wise
did the twain mistress and maid with the third and the fourth till
Zayn alMawasif had made her complaint to all the four Kazis each of
whom fell in love with her and besought her to wed him to which she
consented with a Yes nor wist any one of the four that which had
happened to the others All this passed without the knowledge of the
Jew who spent the night in the house of the bridefeast And when
morning morrowed Hubub arose and gat ready her ladys richest raiment
then she clad her therewith and presented herself with her before the
four Kazis in the court of justice As soon as she entered she veiled
her face and saluted the judges who returned her salam and each and
every of them recognised her One was writing and the reedpen dropped
from his hand another was talking and his tongue became tied and a
third was reckoning and blundered in his reckoning and they said to
her O admirable of attributes and singular among beauties be not thy
heart other than hearty for we will assuredly do thee justice and bring
thee to thy desire So she called down blessings on them and farewelled
them and went her waysAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased saying her permitted say


        Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Fiftyninth Night

She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Kazis
said to Zayn alMawasif O admirable of attributes and singular among
beauties Be not thy heart other than hearty for our doing thy desire
and thy winning to thy will So she called down blessings on them and
farewelled them and went her ways the while her husband abode with his
friends at the marriagebanquet and knew naught of her doings Then she
proceeded to beseech the notaries and scribes and the notables and the
Chiefs of Police to succour her against that unbelieving miscreant and
deliver her from the torment she suffered from him Then she wept with
sore weeping and improvised these couplets

 Rain showers of torrent tears O Eyne and see  An they will quench the
    fires that flame in me
 After my robes of goldembroidered silk  I wake to wear the frieze of
    monkery
 And all my raiment reeks of sulphurfumes  When erst my shift shed
    musky fragrancy
 And hadst thou O Masrr my case descried  Neer hadst thou borne my
    shame and ignomy
 And eke Hubb in iron chains is laid  By Miscreant who unknows Gods
    Unity
 The creed of Jewry I renounce and home  The Moslems Faith accepting
    faithfully
 Eastwards I prostrate self in fairest guise  Holding the only True
    Belief that be

 Masrr forget not love between us twain  And keep our vows and troth
    with goodly gree
 Ive changed my faith for sake of thee and I  For stress of love will
    cleave to secrecy
 So haste to us an us in heart thou bear  As noble spirit nor as
    laggard fare

After this she wrote a letter to Masrur describing to him all that the
Jew had done with her from first to last and enclosed the verses
aforesaid Then she folded the scroll and gave it to her maid Hubub
saying Keep this in thy pocket till we send it to Masrur Upon these
doings lo and behold in came the Jew and seeing them joyous said to
them How cometh it that I find you merry Say me hath a letter
reached you from your bosom friend Masrur Replied Zayn alMawasif We
have no helper against thee save Allah extolled and exalted be He He
will deliver us from thy tyranny and except thou restore us to our
birthplace and homestead we will complain of thee tomorrow to the
Governor of this town and to the Kazi Quoth he Who struck off the
shackles from your legs But needs must I let make for each of you
fetters ten pounds in weight and go round about the city with you
Replied Hubub All that thou purposest against us thou shall fall into
thyself so it please Allah the Most High by token that thou hast
exiled us from our homes and tomorrow we shall stand we and thou
before the Governor of the city They nighted on this wise and next
morning the Jew rose up in haste and went out to order new shackles
whereupon Zayn alMawasif arose and repaired with her women to the
courthouse where she found the four Kazis and saluted them They all
returned her salutation and the Kazi of Kazis said to those about him
Verily this damsel is lovely as the Venusstar and all who see her
love her and bow before her beauty and loveliness Then he despatched
four sergeants who were Sharfs saying Bring ye the criminal
after abjectest fashion So when the Jew returned with the shackles
and found none in the house he was confounded but as he abode in
perplexity suddenly up came the officers and laying hold of him beat
him with a sore beating and dragged him face downwards before the Kazi
When the judge saw him he cried out in his face and said to him Woe
to thee O foe of God is it come to such a pass with thee that thou
doest the deed thou hast done and bringest these women far from their
country and stealest their monies and wouldst make them Jews How durst
thou seek to make Miscreants of Moslems Answered the Jew O my lord
this woman is my wife Now when the Kazis heard this they all cried
out saying Throw this hound on the ground and come down on his face
with your sandals and beat him with sore blows for his offence is
unpardonable So they pulled off his silken gear and clad him in his
wifes raiment of haircloth after which they threw him down and
plucked out his beard and belaboured him about the face with sandals
Then they sat him on an ass face to crupper arsiversy and making him
take its tail in his hand paraded him round about the city ringing the
bell before him in every street after which they brought him back to
the Judges in sorriest plight and the four Kazis with one voice
condemned him to have his feet and hands cut off and lastly to be
crucified When the accursed heard this sentence his sense forsook him
and he was confounded and said O my lords the Kazis what would ye of
me They replied Say thouThis damsel is not my wife and the monies
are her monies and I have transgressed against her and brought her far
from her country So he confessed to this and the Kazis recorded his
confession in legal form and taking the money from him gave it to Zayn
alMawasif together with the document Then she went away and all who
saw her were confounded at her beauty and loveliness whilst each of the
Kazis looked for her committing herself to him But when she came to
her lodging she made ready all matters she needed and waited till
night Then she took what was light of load and weighty of worth and
setting out with her maids under cover of the murks three days with
their nights fared on without stopping Thus it was with her but as
regards the Kazis they ordered the Jew to prisonAnd Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say


         Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Sixtieth Night

She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Kazis ordered
the Jew to prison and on the morrow they looked for Zayn alMawasif
coming to them they and their assessors but she presented herself not
to any of them Then said the Chief Kazi I wish today to make an
excursion without the town on business there So he mounted his
shemule and taking his page with him went winding about the streets of
the town searching its length and width for Zayn alMawasif but never
finding her On this errand he came upon the other three Kazis going
about on the same each deeming himself the only one to whom she had
given tryst He asked them whither they were riding and why they were
going about the streets when they told him their business whereby he
saw that their plight was as his plight and their quest as his quest So
they all four rode throughout the city seeking her but could hit on no
trace of her and returned to their houses sick for love and lay down
on the bed of langour Presently the Chief Kazi bethought himself of the
blacksmith so he sent for him and said to him O blacksmith knowest
thou aught of the damsel whom thou didst direct to me By Allah an thou
discover her not to me I will whack thee with whips Now when the
smith heard this he recited these couplets

 She who my all of love by love of her hath won  Owns every Beauty and
    for others leaves she none
 She gazes a gazelle she breathes fresh ambergris  She waves a lake
    she sways a bough she shines a Sun

Then said the blacksmith By Allah O my lord since she fared forth
from thy worshipful presence I have not set eyes on her no not
once Indeed she took possession of my heart and wits and all my talk
and thoughts are of her I went to her lodging but found her not nor
found I any who could give me news of her and it is as if she had dived
into the depths of the sea or had ascended to the sky Now when the
Kazi heard this he groaned a groan that his soul was like to depart
therefor and he said By Allah well it were had we never seen her
Then the smith went away whilst the Kazi fell down on his bed and
became sick of languor for her sake and on like wise fared it with the
other three Kazis and assessors The mediciners paid them frequent
calls but found in them no ailment requiring a leach so the
citynotables went in to the Chief Kazi and saluting him questioned him
of his case whereupon he sighed and showed them that was in his heart
reciting these couplets

 Stint ye this blame enough I suffer from Loves malady  Nor chide the
    Kazi frail who fain must deal to folk decree
 Who doth accuse my love let him for me find some excuse  Nor blame
    for lovers blameless are in loverslavery
 I was a Kzi whom my Fate deigned aid with choicest aid  By writ and
    reed and raisd me to wealth and high degree
 Till I was shot by sharpest shaft that knows nor leach nor cure  By
    Damsels glance who came to spill my blood and murther me
 To me came she a Moslemah and of her wrongs she plained  With lips
    that oped on Orientpearls ranged fair and orderly
 I looked beneath her veil and saw a wending moon at full  Rising below
    the wings of Night engloomed with blackest blee
 A brightest favour and a mouth bedight with wondrous smiles  Beauty
    had brought the loveliest garb and robed her cappie
 By Allah neer beheld my eyes a face so ferly fair  Amid mankind
    whoever are Arab or Ajam
 My Fair What promise didst thou make what time to me thou saidst 
    Whenas I promise I perform O Kazi faithfully
 Such is my stead and such my case calamitous and dire  And ask me not
    ye men of spunk what dreadful teen I dree

When he ended his verse he wept with sore weeping and sobbed one sob and
his spirit departed his body which seeing they washed him and shrouded
him and prayed over him and buried him graving on his tomb these
couplets

 Perfect were lovers qualities in him was brought amorn  Slain by his
    love and his beloved to this untimely grave
 Kzi was he amid the folk and aye twas his delight  To foster all the
    folk and keep asheath the Justiceglaive
 Love caused his doom and neer we saw among mankind before  The lord
    and master louting low before his thralld slave

Then they committed him to the mercy of Allah and went away to the
second Kazi in company with the physician but found in him nor injury
nor ailment needing a leach Accordingly they questioned him of his case
and what preoccupied him so he told them what ailed him whereupon they
blamed him and chid him for his predicament and he answered them with
these couplets

 Blighted by her yet am I not to blame  Struck by the dart at me her
    fair hand threw
 Unto me came a woman called Hubb  Chiding the world from year to year
    anew
 And brought a damsel showing face that shamed  Full moon that sails
    through Nighttides blackest hue
 She showed her beauties and she plained her plain  Which tears in
    torrents from her eyelids drew
 I to her words gave ear and gazed on her  Whenas with smiling lips she
    made me rue
 Then with my heart she fared whereer she fared  And left me pledged to
    sorrows soul subdue
 Such is my tale So pity ye my case  And this my page with Kazis gear
    indue

Then he sobbed one sob and his soul fled his flesh whereupon they gat
ready his funeral and buried him commending him to the mercy of Allah
after which they repaired to the third Kazi and the fourth and there
befel them the like of what befel their brethren Furthermore they
found the Assessors also sick for love of her and indeed all who saw
her died of her love or an they died not lived on tortured with the
lowe of passionAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased
saying her permitted say


        Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Sixtyfirst Night

She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that the city folk
found all the Kazis and the Assessors sick for love of her and all who
saw her died lovesick or an they died not lived on tortured with the
lowe of passion for stress of pining to no purposeAllah have mercy on
them one and all Meanwhile Zayn alMawasif and her women drave on with
all diligence till they were far distant from the city and it so
fortuned that they came to a convent by the way wherein dwelt a Prior
called Danis and forty monks When the Prior saw her beauty he
went out to her and invited her to alight saying Rest with us ten
days and after wend your ways So she and her damsels alighted and
entered the convent and when Danis saw her beauty and loveliness she
debauched his belief and he was seduced by her wherefore he fell to
sending the monks one after other with lovemessages but each who saw
her fell in love with her and sought her favours for himself whilst she
excused and denied herself to them But Danis ceased not his
importunities till he had dispatched all the forty each one of whom
fell lovesick at first sight and plied her with blandishments never
even naming Danis whilst she refused and rebuffed them with harsh
replies At last when Daniss patience was at an end and his passion was
sore on him he said in himself Verily the soothsayer saithNaught
scratcheth my skin but my own nail and naught like my own feet for mine
errand may avail So up he rose and made ready rich meats and it was
the ninth day of her sojourn in the convent where she had purposed only
to rest Then he carried them in to her and set them before her saying
Bismillah favour us by tasting the best of the food at our command
So she put forth her hand saying For the name of Allah the
Compassionating the Compassionate and ate she and her handmaidens
When she had made an end of eating he said to her O my lady I wish
to recite to thee some verses Quoth she Say on and he recited
these couplets

 Thou hast won my heart by cheek and eye of thee  Ill praise for love
    in prose and poesy

 Wilt fly a lover lovesick lovedistraught  Who strives in dreams
    some cure of love to see
 Leave me not fallen passionfooled since I  For pine have left
    uncared the Monastry
 O Fairest tis thy right to shed my blood  So rue my case and hear
    the cry of me

When Zayn alMawasif heard his verses she answered him with these two
couplets

 O who suest Union neer hope such delight  Nor solicit my favours O
    hapless wight
 Cease to hanker for what thou canst never have  Next door are the
    greedy to sore despight

Hearing this he returned to his place pondering in himself and knowing
not how he should do in her affair and passed the night in the sorriest
plight But as soon as the darkness was darkest Zayn alMawasif arose
and said to her handmaids Come let us away for we cannot avail
against forty men monks each of whom requireth me for himself Quoth
they Right willingly So they mounted their beasts and issued forth
the convent gateAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to
say her permitted say


       Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Sixtysecond Night

She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that Zayn alMawasif
and her handmaids issued forth the convent gate and under favour of the
night rode on till they overtook a caravan with which they mingled and
found it came from the city of Adan wherein the lady had dwelt
Presently Zayn alMawasif heard the people of the caravan discoursing
of her own case and telling how the Kazis and Assessors were dead of
love for her and how the townsfolk had appointed in their stead others
who released her husband from prison Whereupon she turned to her maids
and asked them Heard ye that and Hubub answered If the monks were
ravished with love of thee whose belief it is that shunning women is
worship how should it be with the Kazis who hold that there is no
monkery in AlIslam But let us make our way to our own country whilst
our affair is yet hidden So they drave on with all diligence Such was
their case but as regards the monks on the morrow as soon as it was
day they repaired to Zayn alMawasifs lodging to salute her but found
the place empty and their hearts sickened within them So the first
monk rent his raiment and improvised these couplets

 Ho ye my friends draw near for I forthright  From you depart since
    parting is my lot
 My vitals suffer pangs o fiery love  Flames of desire in heart burn
    high and hot
 For sake of fairest girl who sought our land  Whose charms th
    horizons full moon evens not
 She fared and left me victimed by her love  And slain by shaft those
    lids deathdealing shot

Then another monk recited the following couplets

 O ye who with my vitals fled have ruth  On this unhappy haste ye
    homewardbound
 They fared and fared fair Peace on farthest track  Yet lingers in mine
    ear that sweetest sound
 Fared far and far their fane would Heaven I saw  Their shade in
    vision float my couch around
 And when they went wi them they bore my heart  And in my tearfloods
    all of me left drowned

A third monk followed with these extempore lines

 Throne you on highmost stead heart ears and sight  Your wones my
    heart mine alls your dwellingsite
 Sweeter than honey is your name alip  Running as neath my ribs runs
    vital sprite
 For Love hath made me as a toothpick lean  And drowned in tears of
    sorrow and despight
 Let me but see you in my sleep belike  Shall clear my cheeks of tears
    that lovely sight

Then a fourth recited the following couplets

 Dumb is my tongue and scant my speech for thee  And Love the direst
    torture gars me dree
 O thou full Moon whose place is highest Heaven  For thee but double
    pine and pain in me

And a fifth these

 I love a moon of comely shapely form  Whose slender waist hath title to
    complain
 Whose lipdews rival must and longkept wine  Whose heavy haunches
    haunt the minds of men
 My heart each morning burns with pain and pine  And the nighttalkers
    note Im passionslain
 While down my cheeks carnelianlike the tears  Of rosy red shower down
    like railing rain

And a sixth the following

 O thou who shunnest him thy love misled  O Branch of Bn O star of
    highmost stead
 To thee of pine and passion I complain  O thou who fired me with
    cheeks rosyred
 Did eer such lover lose his soul for thee  Or from prostration and
    from prayers fled

And a seventh these

 He seized my heart and freed my tears to flow  Brought strength to Love
    and bade my Patience go
 His charms are sweet as bitter his disdain  And shafts of love his
    suitors overthrow
 Stint blame O blamer and for past repent  None will believe thee who
    dost Love unknow

And on like wise all the rest of the monks shed tears and repeated
verses As for Danis the Prior weeping and wailing redoubled on him
for that he found no way to her enjoyment and he chanted the following
couplets

 My patience failed me when my lover went  And fled that day mine aim
    and best intent
 O Guide o litters lead their camels fair  Haply some day theyll
    deign with me to tent
 On partingday Sleep parted from my lids  And grew my grieving and my
    joy was shent
 I moan to Allah what for Love I dreed  My wasted body and my forces
    spent

Then despairing of her they took counsel together and with one mind
agreed to fashion her image and set it up with them and applied
themselves to this till there came to them the Destroyer of delights and
Severer of societies Meanwhile Zayn alMawasif fared on without
ceasing to find her lover Masrur till she reached her own house She
opened the doors and entered then she sent to her sister Nasim who
rejoiced with exceeding joy at the news of her return and brought her
the furniture and precious stuffs left in her charge So she furnished
the house and dressed it hanging the curtains over the doors and
burning aloeswood and musk and ambergris and other essences till the
whole place reeked with the most delightful perfumes after which the
Adornment of Qualities donned her finest dress and decorations and sat
talking with her maids whom she had left behind when journeying and
related to them all that had befallen her first and last Then she
turned to Hubub and giving her dirhams bade her fetch them something to
eat So she brought meat and drink and when they had made an end of
eating and drinking Zayn alMawasif bade Hubub go and see where
Masrur was and how it fared with him Now he knew not of her return but
abode with concern overcast and sorrow might not be overpastAnd
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say


        Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Sixtythird Night

She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Zayn
alMawasif entered her house she was met by her sister Nasim who brought
her the furniture and stuffs wherewith she furnished the place and then
she donned her finest dress But Masrur knew naught of her return and
abode with concern overcast and sorrow might not be overpast no peace
prevailed with him nor was patience possible to him Whenas pine and
passion desire and distraction waxed on him he would solace himself by
reciting verse and go to the house and set him its walls to buss It
chanced that he went out that day to the place where he had parted from
his mistress and repeated this rare song

 My wrongs hide I withal they show to sight  And now mine eyes from
    sleep to wake are dight
 I cry when melancholy tries my sprite  Last not O world nor work more
    despight
           Lo hangs my soul twixt hardship and affright


 Were the Sultan hight Love but fair to me  Slumber mine eyes
    companion were to me
 My Lords some little mercy spare to me  Chief of my tribe be
    debonnair to me
           Whom Love cast down erst rich now pauperwight

 Censors may blame thee but I look beyond  Mine ears I stop and leave
    their lies unconned
 And keep my pact wi those I love so fond  They say Thou lovst a
    runaway I respond
           Whist whenas Fate descends she blinds the sight

Then he returned to his lodging and sat there weeping till sleep
overcame him when he saw in a dream as if Zayn alMawasif were come to
the house and awoke in tears So he set off to go thither improvising
these couplets

 Shall I be consoled when Love hath mastered the secret of me  And my
    heart is aglow with more than the charcoals ardency
 I love her whose absence I plain before Allah for partingstower  And
    the shifts of the days and doom which allotted me Destiny
 When shall our meeting be O wish o my heart and will  O favour of
    fullest Moon when shall we Reunion see

As he made an end of his recitation he found himself walking adown in
Zayn alMawasifs street and smelt the sweet savour of the pastiles
wherewithal she had incensed the house wherefore his vitals fluttered
and his heart was like to leave his breast and desire flamed up in him
and distraction redoubled upon him when lo and behold Hubub on her
way to do her ladys errand suddenly appeared at the head of the street
and he rejoiced with joy exceeding When she saw him she went up to him
and saluting him gave him the glad news of her mistresss return
saying She hath sent me to bid thee to her Whereat he was glad
indeed with gladness naught could exceed and she took him and returned
with him to the house When Zayn alMawasif saw him she came down to
him from the couch and kissed him and he kissed her and she embraced him
and he embraced her nor did they leave kissing and embracing till both
swooned away for stress of affection and separation They lay a long
while senseless and when they revived Zayn alMawasif bade Hubub fetch
her a gugglet of sherbet of sugar and another of sherbet of lemons So
she brought what she desired and they sat eating and drinking nor ceased
before nightfall when they fell to recalling all that had befallen them
from commencement to conclusion Then she acquainted him with her return
to AlIslam whereat he rejoiced and he also became a Moslem On like
wise did her women and they all repented to Allah Almighty of their
infidelity On the morrow she bade send for the Kazi and the witnesses
and told them that she was a widow and had completed the
purificationperiod and was minded to marry Masrur So they drew up the
weddingcontract between them and they abode in all delight of life
Meanwhile the Jew when the people of Adan released him from prison
set out homewards and fared on nor ceased faring till he came within
three days journey of the city Now as soon as Zayn alMawasif heard of
his coming she called for her handmaid Hubub and said to her Go to the
Jews burialplace and there dig a grave and plant on it sweet basil and
jessamine and sprinkle water thereabout If the Jew come and ask thee of
me answerMy mistress died twenty days ago of chagrin on thine
account If he say show me her tomb take him to the grave and after
weeping over it and making moan and lament before him contrive to cast
him therein and bury him alive And Hubub answered I hear and I
obey Then they laid up the furniture in the store closets and Zayn
alMawasif removed to Masrurs lodging where he and she abode eating
and drinking till the three days were past at the end of which the Jew
arrived and knocked at the door of his house Quoth Hubub Whos at the
door and quoth he Thy master So she opened to him and he saw the
tears railing down her cheeks and said What aileth thee to weep and
where is thy mistress She replied My mistress is dead of chagrin on
thine account When he heard this he was perplexed and wept with sore
weeping and presently said O Hubub where is her tomb So she carried
him to the Jews burialground and showed him the grave she had dug
whereupon he shed bitter tears and recited this pair of couplets

 Two things there are for which if eyes wept tear on tear  Of blood
    till they were like indeed to disappear
 They never could fulfil the Tithe of all their due  And these are
    prime of youth and loss of loveling dear

Then he wept again with bitter tears and recited these also

 Alack and Alas Patience taketh flight  And from parting of friend to
    sore death Im dight
 O how woeful this farness from dear one and oh  How my heart is rent
    by mine own unright
 Would Heaven my secret I erst had kept  Nor had told the pangs and my
    liverblight
 I lived in all solace and joyance of life  Till she left and left me in
    piteous plight
 O Zayn alMawasif I would there were  No parting departing my frame
    and sprite
 I repent me for trothbreach and blame my guilt  Of unruth to her
    whereon hopes I built

When he had made an end of this verse he wept and groaned and lamented
till he fell down aswoon whereupon Hubub made haste to drag him to the
grave and throw him in whilst he was insensible yet quick withal Then
she stopped up the grave on him and returning to her mistress acquainted
her with what had passed whereat she rejoiced with exceeding joy and
recited these two couplets

 The world sware that for ever twould gar me grieve  Tis false O
    world so thine oath retrieve
 The blamer is dead and my loves in my arms  Rise to herald of joys
    and tuck high thy sleeve

Then she and Masrur abode each with other in eating and drinking and
sport and pleasure and good cheer till there came to them the Destroyer
of delights and Sunderer of societies and Slayer of sons and daughters
And I have also heard tell the following tale of

            ALI NUR ALDIN AND MIRIAM THE GIRDLEGIRL


There was once in days of yore and in ages and times long gone before in
the parts of Cairo a merchant named Tj alDn who was of the most
considerable of the merchants and of the chiefs of the freeborn But he
was given to travelling everywhere and loved to fare over wild and wold
waterless lowland and stony waste and to journey to the isles of the
seas in quest of dirhams and dinars wherefore he had in his time
encountered dangers and suffered duresse of the way such as would
grizzle little children and turn their black hair grey He was possessed
of black slaves and Mamelukes Eunuchs and concubines and was the
wealthiest of the merchants of his time and the goodliest of them in
speech owning horses and mules and Bactrian camels and dromedaries
sacks great and small of size goods and merchandise and stuffs such as
muslins of Hums silks and brocades of Baallak cotton of Mery stuffs
of India gauzes of Baghdad burnouses of Moorland and Turkish white
slaves and Abyssinian castratos and Grecian girls and Egyptian boys and
the coverings of his bales were silk with gold purfled fair for he was
wealthy beyond compare Furthermore he was rare of comeliness
accomplished in goodliness and gracious in his kindliness even as one
of his describers doth thus express

 A merchant I spied whose lovers  Were fighting in furious guise
 Quoth he Why this turmoil of people  Quoth I Trader for those
    fine eyes

And saith another in his praise and saith well enough to accomplish the
wish of him

 Came a merchant to pay us a visit  Whose glance did my heart surprise
 Quoth he What surprised thee so  Quoth I Trader twas those fine
    eyes

Now that merchant had a son called Ali Nur alDin as he were the full
moon whenas it meeteth the sight on its fourteenth night a marvel of
beauty and loveliness a model of form and symmetrical grace who was
sitting one day as was his wont in his fathers shop selling and
buying giving and taking when the sons of the merchants girt him around
and he was amongst them as moon among stars with brow flowerwhite and
cheeks of rosy light in down the tenderest dight and body like
alabasterbright even as saith of him the poet

 Describe me a fair one said  Said I Thou art Beautys queen
 And speaking briefest speech  All charms in thee are seen

And as saith of him one of his describers

 His mole upon plain of cheek is like  Ambergrscrumb on marble plate
 And his glances likest the sword proclaim  To all Loves rebels The
    Lord is Great

The young merchants invited him saying O my lord Nur alDin we wish
thee to go this day apleasuring with us in such a garden And he
answered Wait till I consult my parent for I cannot go without his
consent As they were talking behold up came Taj alDin and his son
looked to him and said O father mine the sons of the merchants have
invited me to wend apleasuring with them in such a garden Dost thou
grant me leave to go His father replied Yes O my son fare with
them and gave him somewhat of money So the young men mounted their
mules and asses and Nur alDin mounted a shemule and rode with them to
a garden wherein was all that soul desireth and that eye charmeth It
was high of walls which from broad base were seen to rise and it had a
gateway vaultwise with a portico like a saloon and a door azure as the
skies as it were one of the gates of Paradise the name of the
doorkeeper was Rizwn and over the gate were trained an hundred
trellises which grapes overran and these were of various dyes the red
like coralline the black like the snouts of Sdnmen and the
white like egg of the pigeonhen And in it peach and pomegranate were
shown and pear apricot and pomegranate were grown and fruits with and
without stone hanging in clusters or aloneAnd Shahrazad perceived the
dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say


       Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Sixtyfourth Night

She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the sons
of the merchants entered the vergier they found therein all that soul
desireth or eye charmeth grapes of many hues grown hanging in bunches
or alone even as saith of them the poet

 Grapes tasting with the taste of wine  Whose coats like blackest
    Ravens shine
 Their sheen amid the leafage shows  Like womens fingers hennad
    fine

And as saith another on the same theme

 Grapebunches likest as they sway  Astalk my body frail and snell
 Honey and water thus in jar  When sourness past make Hydromel

Then they entered the arbour of the garden and saw there Rizwan the
gatekeeper sitting as he were Rizwan the Paradiseguardian and on the
door were written these lines

 Garth Heavenwatered wherein clusters waved  On boughs which full of
    sap to bend were fain
 And when the branches danced on Zephyrs palm  The Pleiads showerd
    as gifts fresh pearls for rain

And within the arbour were written these two couplets

 Come with us friend and enter thou  This garth that cleanses rust of
    grief
 Over their skirts the Zephyrs trip  And flowers in sleeve to laugh
    are lief

So they entered and found all manner fruits in view and birds of every
kind and hue such as ringdove nightingale and curlew and the turtle
and the cushat sang their love lays on the sprays Therein were rills
that ran with limpid wave and flowers suave and bloom for whose perfume
we crave and it was even as saith of it the poet in these two couplets

 The Zephyr breatheth oer its branches like  Fair girls that trip as
    in fair skirts they pace
 Its rills resemble swords in hands of knights  Drawn from the scabbard
    and containingcase

And again as singeth the songster

 The streamlet swings by branchy wood and aye  Joys in its breast those
    beauties to display
 And Zephyr noting this for jealousy  Hastens and bends the branches
    other way

On the trees of the garden were all manner fruits each in two
sorts and amongst them the pomegranate as it were a ball of
silverdross whereof saith the poet and saith right well

 Granados of finest skin like the breasts  Of maid firmstanding in
    sight of male
 When I strip the skin they at once display  The rubies compelling all
    sense to quail

And even as quoth another bard

 Close prest appear to him who views th inside  Red rubies in brocaded
    skirts bedight
 Granado I compare with marble dome  Or virgins breasts delighting
    every sight
 Therein is cure for every ill as een  Left an Hads the Prophet pure
    of sprite
 And Allah glorify His name eke deigned  A noble say in Holy Book
    indite

The apples were the sugared and the musky and the Dmni amazing the
beholder whereof saith Hassn the poet

 Apple which joins hues twain and brings to mind  The cheek of lover
    and beloved combined
 Two wondrous opposites on branch they show  This dark and that
    with hue incarnadined
 The twain embraced when spied the spy and turned  This red that yellow
    for the shame designed

There also were apricots of various kinds almond and camphor and Jlni
and Antbi whereof saith the poet

 And Almondapricot suggesting swain  Whose lovers visit all his wits
    hath taen
 Enough of lovesick lovers plight it shows  Of face deep yellow and
    heart torn in twain

And saith another and saith well

 Look at that Apricot whose bloom contains  Gardens with brightness
    gladding all mens eyne
 Like stars the blossoms sparkle when the boughs  Are clad in foliage
    dight with sheen and shine

There likewise were plums and cherries and grapes that the sick of all
diseases assain and do away giddiness and yellow choler from the brain
and figs the branches between varicoloured red and green amazing
sight and sense even as saith the poet

 Tis as the Figs with clear white skins outthrown  By foliaged trees
    athwart whose green they peep
 Were sons of Roum that guard the palaceroof  When shades close in and
    nightlong ward they keep

And saith another and saith well

 Welcome the Fig To us it comes  Ordered in handsome plates they
    bring
 Likest a Sufrahcloth we draw  To shape of bag without a ring

And how well saith a third

 Give me the Fig sweetflavoured beautyclad  Whose inner beauties
    rival outer sheen
 And when it fruits thou tastest it to find  Chamomiles scent and
    Sugars saccharine
 And eke it favoureth on platters poured  Puffballs of silken thread
    and sendal green

And how excellent is the saying of one of them

 Quoth they and I had trained my taste thereto  Nor cared for other
    fruits whereby they swore
 Why lovest so the Fig whereto quoth I  Some men love Fig and others
    Sycamore

And are yet goodlier those of another

 Pleaseth me more the fig than every fruit  When ripe and hanging from
    the sheeny bough
 Like Devotee who when the clouds pour rain  Sheds tears and Allahs
    power doth avow

And in that garth were also pears of various kinds Sinatic
Aleppine and Grecian growing in clusters and alone parcel green and
parcel goldenAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying
her permitted say


        Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Sixtyfifth Night

She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the
merchants sons went down into the garth they saw therein all the fruits
we mentioned and found pears Sinatic Aleppine and Grecian of every
hue which here clustering there single grew parcel green and parcel
yellow to the gazer a marvelview as saith of them the poet

 With thee that Pear agree whose hue amorn  Is hue of hapless lover
    yellow pale
 Like virgin cloistered strait in strong Harm  Whose face like racing
    steed outstrips the veil

And Sultani peaches of shades varied yellow and red whereof saith
the poet

    Like Peach in vergier growing  And sheen of Andam showing
    Whose balls of yellow gold  Are dyed with bloodgouts flowing

There were also green almonds of passing sweetness resembling the
cabbage of the palmtree with their kernels within three tunics
lurking of the Munificent Kings handiworking even as is said of them

 Three coats yon freshest form endue  Gods work of varied shape and
    hue
 Hardness surrounds it night and day  Prisoning without a sin to rue

And as well saith another

 Seest not that Almond plucked by hand  Of man from bough where wont to
    dwell
 Peeling it shows the heart within  As unionpearl in oystershell

And as saith a third better than he

 How good is Almond green I view  The smallest fills the hand of you
 Its nap is as the down upon  The cheeks where yet no beardlet grew
 Its kernels in the shell are seen  Or bachelors or married two
 As pearls they were of lucent white  Casd and lapped in Jaspers hue

And as saith yet another and saith well

 Mine eyes neer looked on aught the Almond like  For charms when
    blossoms in the Prime show bright

 Its head to hoariness of age inclines  The while its cheek by youths
    fresh down is dight

And jujubeplums of various colours grown in clusters and alone whereof
saith one describing them

 Look at the Lotetree note on boughs arrayed  Like goodly apricots on
    reedstrown floor
 Their morninghue to viewers eye is like  Cascavels cast of
    purest golden ore

And as saith another and saith right well

       The Jujubetree each Day  Robeth in bright array
       As though each pome thereon  Would self to sight display
       Like falconbell of gold  Swinging from every spray

And in that garth grew blood oranges as they were the Khaulanjn
whereof quoth the enamoured poet

 Red fruits that fill the hand and shine with sheen  Of fire albe the
    scarfskins white as snow
 Tis marvel snow on fire doth never melt  And stranger still neer
    burns this living lowe

And quoth another and quoth well

 And trees of Orange fruiting ferly fair  To those who straitest have
    their charms surveyed
 Like cheeks of women who their forms have decked  For holiday in robes
    of gold brocade

And yet another as well

 Like are the Orangehills when Zephyr breathes  Swaying the boughs
    and spray with airy grace
 Her cheeks that glow with lovely light when met  At greetingtide by
    cheeks of other face

And a fourth as fairly

 And fairest Fawn we said to him Portray  This garth and oranges thine
    eyes survey
 And he Your garden favoureth my face  Who gathereth orange gathereth
    fire alwy

In that garden too grew citrons in colour as virgin gold hanging down
from on high and dangling among the branches as they were ingots of
growing gold and saith thereof the namoured poet

 Hast seen a Citroncopse so weighed adown  Thou fearest bending roll
    their fruit on mould
 And seemed when Zephyr passed athwart the tree  Its branches hung
    with bells of purest gold

And shaddocks that among their boughs hung laden as though each
were the breast of a gazellelike maiden contenting the most longing
wight as saith of them the poet and saith aright

 And Shaddock mid the gardenpaths on bough  Freshest like fairest
    damsel met my sight
 And to the blowing of the breeze it bent  Like golden ball to bat of
    chrysolite

And the lime sweet of scent which resembleth a hens egg but its
yellowness ornamenteth its ripe fruit and its fragrance hearteneth him
who plucketh it as saith the poet who singeth it

 Seest not the Lemon when it taketh form  Catch rays of light and all
    to gaze constrain
 Like egg of pullet which the hucksters hand  Adorneth dyeing with the
    saffronstain

Moreover in this garden were all manner of other fruits and
sweetscented herbs and plants and fragrant flowers such as jessamine
and henna and waterlilies and spikenard and roses of every
kind and plantain and myrtle and so forth and indeed it was
without compare seeming as it were a piece of Paradise to whoso beheld
it If a sick man entered it he came forth from it like a raging lion
and tongue availeth not to its description by reason of that which was
therein of wonders and rarities which are not found but in Heaven and
how should it be otherwise when its doorkeepers name was Rizwan
Though widely different were the stations of those twain Now when the
sons of the merchants had walked about gazing at the garden after taking
their pleasure therein they sat down in one of its pavilions and seated
Nur alDin in their midstAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased to say her permitted say


        Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Sixtysixth Night

She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the sons
of the merchants sat down in the pavilion they seated Nur alDin in
their midst on a rug of goldpurfled leather of AlTif leaning on
a pillow of minever stuffed with ostrich down And they gave him a
fan of ostrich feathers whereon were written these two couplets

 A fan whose breath is fraught with fragrant scent  Minding of happy
    days and times forspent
 Wafting at every time its perfumed air  Oer face of noble youth on
    honour bent

Then they laid by their turbands and outer clothes and sat talking and
chatting and inducing one another to discourse while they all kept
their eyes fixed on Nur alDin and gazed on his beauteous form After
the sitting had lasted an hour or so up came a slave with a tray on his
head wherein were platters of china and crystal containing viands of
all sorts for one of the youths had so charged his people before coming
to the garden and the meats were of whatever walketh earth or wingeth
air or swimmeth waters such as Katgrouse and fat quails and
pigeonpoults and mutton and chickens and the delicatest fish So the
tray being sat before them they fell to and ate their fill and when
they had made an end of eating they rose from meat and washed their
hands with pure water and muskscented soap and dried them with napery
embroidered in silk and bugles but to Nur alDin they brought a napkin
laced with red gold whereon he wiped his hands Then coffee was
served up and each drank what he would after which they sat talking
till presently the gardenkeeper who was young went away and returning
with a basket full of roses said to them What say ye O my masters
to flowers Quoth one of them There is no harm in them
especially roses which are not to be resisted Answered the gardener
Tis well but it is of our wont not to give roses but in exchange for
pleasant converse so whoever would take aught thereof let him recite
some verses suitable to the situation Now they were ten sons of
merchants of whom one said Agreed give me thereof and I will recite
thee somewhat of verse apt to the case Accordingly the gardener gave
him a bunch of roses which he took and at once improvised these
three couplets

 The Rose in highest stead I rate  For that her charms neer satiate
 All fragrant flowrs be troops to her  Their general of high estate
 Where she is not they boast and vaunt  But when she comes they stint
    their prate

Then the gardener gave a bunch to another and he recited these two
couplets

 Take O my lord to thee the Rose  Recalling scent by musk be shed
 Like virginette by lover eyed  Who with her sleeves enveileth
    head

Then he gave a bunch to a third who recited these two couplets

 Choice Rose that gladdens heart to see her sight  Of Nadd recalling
    fragrance exquisite
 The branchlets clip her in her leaves for joy  Like kiss of lips that
    never spake in spite

Then he gave a bunch to a fourth and he recited these two couplets

 Seest not that rosery where Rose aflowering displays  Mounted upon her
    steed of stalk those marvels manifold
 As though the bud were rubystone and girded all around  With
    chrysolite and held within a little hoard of gold

Then he gave a posy to a fifth and he recited these two couplets

 Wands of green chrysolite bare issue which  Were fruits like ingots of
    the growing gold
 And drops a dropping from its leaves were like  The tears my
    languorous eyelids railed and rolled

Then he gave a sixth a bunch and he recited these two couplets

 O Rose thou rare of charms that dost contain  All gifts and Allahs
    secrets singular
 Thourt like the loved ones cheek where lover fond  And fain of Union
    sticks the gold dinr

Then he gave a bunch to a seventh and he recited these two couplets

 To Rose quoth I What gars thy thorns to be put forth  For all who
    touch thee cruellest injury
 Quoth she These flowery troops are troops of me  Who be their lord
    with spines for armoury

And he gave an eighth a bunch and he recited these two couplets

 Allah save the Rose which yellows amorn  Florid vivid and likest the
    nuggetore
 And bless the fair sprays that displayed such flowers  And mimic suns
    goldbegilded bore

Then he gave a bunch to a ninth and he recited these two couplets

 The bushes of goldenhued Rose excite  In the lovesick lover joys
    manifold
 Tis a marvel shrub watered every day  With silvern lymph and it
    fruiteth gold

Then he gave a bunch of roses to the tenth and last and he recited these
two couplets

 Seest not how the hosts of the Rose display  Red hues and yellow in
    rosy field
 I compare the Rose and her arming thorn  To emerald lance piercing
    golden shield

And whilst each one hent bunch in hand the gardener brought the
wineservice and setting it before them on a tray of porcelain
arabesqued with red gold recited these two couplets

 Dawn heralds daylight so wine pass round  Old wine fooling sage
    till his wits he tyne
 Wot I not for its purest clarity  An tis wine in cup or tis cup in
    wine

Then the gardener filled and drank and the cup went round till it came
to Nur alDins turn whereupon the man filled and handed it to him but
he said This thing I wot it not nor have I ever drunken thereof for
therein is great offence and the Lord of Allmight hath forbidden it in
His Book Answered the gardener O my Lord Nur alDin an thou forbear
to drink only by reason of the sin verily Allah extolled and exalted
be He is bountiful of sufferance great forgiving and compassionate
and pardoneth the mortalest sins His mercy embraceth all things
Allahs ruth be upon the poet who saith

 Be as thou wilt for Allah is bountiful  And when thou sinnest feel
    thou naught alarm
 But ware of twofold sins nor ever dare  To give God partner or mankind
    to harm

Then quoth one of the sons of the merchants My life on thee O my lord
Nur alDin drink of this cup And another conjured him by the oath of
divorce and yet another stood up persistently before him till he was
ashamed and taking the cup from the gardener drank a draught but spat
it out again crying Tis bitter Said the young gardener O my lord
Nur alDin knowest thou not that sweets taken by way of medicine are
bitter Were this not bitter twould lack of the manifold virtues it
possesseth amongst which are that it digesteth food and disperseth cark
and care and dispelleth flatulence and clarifieth the blood and cleareth
the complexion and quickeneth the body and hearteneth the henhearted
and fortifieth the sexual power in man but to name all its virtues
would be tedious Quoth one of the poets

 Well drink and Allah pardon sinners all  And cure of ills by sucking
    cups Ill find
 Nor aught the sin deceives me yet said He  In it there be
    advantage to mankind

Then he sprang up without stay or delay and opened one of the cupboards
in the pavilion and taking out a loaf of refined sugar broke off a
great slice which he put into Nur alDins cup saying O my lord an
thou fear to drink wine because of its bitterness drink now for tis
sweet So he took the cup and emptied it whereupon one of his comrades
filled him another saying O my lord Nur alDin I am thy slave and
another did the like saying I am one of thy servants and a third
said For my sake and a fourth Allah upon thee O my lord Nur
alDin heal my heart And so they ceased not plying him with wine
each and every of the ten sons of merchants till they had made him drink
a total of ten cups Now Nur alDins body was virgin of winebibbing
or never in all his life had he drunken vinejuice till that hour
wherefore its fumes wrought in his brain and drunkenness was stark upon
him and he stood up and indeed his tongue was thick and his speech
stammering and said O company by Allah ye are fair and your speech
is goodly and your place pleasant but there needeth hearing of sweet
music for drink without melody lacks the chief of its essentiality
even as saith the poet

 Pass round the cup to the old and the young man too And take the bowl
    from the hand of the shining moon
 But without music I charge you forbear to drink I see even horses
    drink to a whistled tune

Therewith up sprang the gardener lad and mounting one of the young mens
mules was absent awhile after which he returned with a Cairene girl
as she were a sheeps tail fat and delicate or an ingot of pure silvern
ore or a dinar on a porcelain plate or a gazelle in the wold forlore
She had a face that put to shame the shining sun and eyes
Babylonian and brows like bows bended and cheeks rosepainted and
teeth pearlyhued and lips sugared and glances languishing and breasts
ivory white and body slender and slight full of folds and with dimples
dight and hips like pillows stuffed and thighs like columns of Syrian
stone and between them what was something like a sachet of spices in
wrapper swathed Quoth the poet of her in these couplets

 Had she shown her shape to idolaters sight  They would gaze on her
    face and their gods detest
 And if in the East to a monk shed showd  Hed quit Eastern posture
    and bow to West
 An she crached in the sea and the briniest sea  Her lips would give it
    the sweetest zest

And quoth another in these couplets

 Brighter than Moon at full with kohld eyes she came  Like Doe on
    chasing whelps of Lioness intent
 Her night of murky locks lets fall a tent on her  A tent of hair
    that lacks no pegs to hold the tent
 And roses lighting up her roseate cheeks are fed  By hearts and livers
    flowing fire for languishment
 An spied her all the Ages Fair to her theyd rise  Humbly and
    cry The meed belongs to precedent

And how well saith a third bard

 Three things for ever hinder her to visit us for fear Of the intriguing
    spy and eke the rancorous envier
 Her foreheads lustre and the sound of all her ornaments And the sweet
    scent her creases hold of ambergris and myrrh
 Grant with the border of her sleeve she hide her brow and doff Her
    ornaments how shall she do her scent away from her

She was like the moon when at fullest on its fourteenth night and was
clad in a garment of blue with a veil of green over brow flowerwhite
that all wits amazed and those of understanding amatedAnd Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say


       Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Sixtyseventh Night

She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the gardener
brought a girl whom we have described possessed of the utmost beauty and
loveliness and fine stature and symmetrical grace as it were she the
poet signified when he said

           She came apparelled in a vest of blue
           That mocked the skies and shamed their azure hue
           I thought thus clad she burst upon my sight
           Like summer moonshine on a wintry night

And how goodly is the saying of another and how excellent

 She came thick veiled and cried I O display  That face like full
    moon bright with purewhite ray
 Quoth she I fear disgrace quoth I Cut short  This talk no shift
    of days thy thoughts affray
 Whereat she raised her veil from fairest face  And crystal spray on
    gems began to stray
 And I forsooth was fain to kiss her cheek  Lest she complain of me on
    JudgmentDay
 And at such tide before the Lord on High  We first of lovers were
    redress to pray
 So Lord prolong this reckoning and review  Prayed I that longer I
    may sight my may

Then said the young gardener to her Know thou O lady of the fair
brighter than any constellation which illumineth air we sought in
bringing thee hither naught but that thou shouldst entertain with
converse this comely youth my lord Nur alDin for he hath come to this
place only this day And the girl replied Would thou hadst told me
that I might have brought what I have with me Rejoined the gardener
O my lady I will go and fetch it to thee As thou wilt said she
and he Give me a token So she gave him a kerchief and he fared forth
in haste and returned after awhile bearing a green satin bag with
slings of gold The girl took the bag from him and opening it shook it
whereupon there fell thereout twoandthirty pieces of wood which she
fitted one into other male into female and female into male till
they became a polished lute of Indian workmanship Then she uncovered
her wrists and laying the lute in her lap bent over it with the bending
of mother over babe and swept the strings with her fingertips
whereupon it moaned and resounded and after its olden home yearned and
it remembered the waters that gave it drink and the earth whence it
sprang and wherein it grew and it minded the carpenters who cut it and
the polishers who polished it and the merchants who made it their
merchandise and the ships that shipped it and it cried and called aloud
and moaned and groaned and it was as if she asked it of all these
things and it answered her with the tongue of the case reciting these
couplets

 A tree whilere was I the Bulbuls home  To whom for love I bowed my
    grassgreen head
 They moaned on me and I their moaning learnt  And in that moan my
    secret all men read
 The woodman felled me falling sans offence  And slender lute of me as
    view ye made
 But when the fingers smite my strings they tell  How man despite my
    patience did me dead
 Hence booncompanions when they hear my moan  Distracted wax as though
    by wine misled
 And the Lord softens every heart to me  And I am hurried to the
    highmost stead
 All who in charms excel fain clasp my waist  Gazelles of languid eyne
    and Houri maid
 Allah neer part fond lover from his joy  Nor live the loved one who
    unkindly fled

Then the girl was silent awhile but presently taking the lute in lap
again bent over it as mother bendeth over child and preluded in many
different modes then returning to the first she sang these couplets

 Would they the lover seek without ado  He to his heavy grief had
    bid adieu

 With him had vied the Nightingale on bough  As one far parted from
    his lovers view
 Rouse thee awake The Moon lights Unionnight  As tho such Union woke
    the Morn anew
 This day the blamers take of us no heed  And lutestrings bid us all
    our joys ensue
 Seest not how fourfold things conjoin in one  Rose myrtle scents and
    blooms of golden hue
 Yea here this day the four chief joys unite  Drink and dinars beloved
    and lover true
 So win thy worldly joy for joys go past  And naught but storied tales
    and legends last

When Nur alDin heard the girl sing these lines he looked on her with
eyes of love and could scarce contain himself for the violence of his
inclination to her and on like wise was it with her because she
glanced at the company who were present of the sons of the merchants and
she saw that Nur alDin was amongst the rest as moon among stars for
that he was sweet of speech and replete with amorous grace perfect in
stature and symmetry brightness and loveliness pure of all defect
than the breeze of morn softer than Tasnim blander as saith of him the
poet

 By his cheeks unfading damask and his smiling teeth I swear By the
    arrows that he feathers with the witchery of his air
 By his sides so soft and tender and his glances bright and keen By the
    whiteness of his forehead and the blackness of his hair
 By his arched imperious eyebrows chasing slumber from my lids With
    their yeas and noes that hold me twixt rejoicing and despair
 By the scorpions that he launches from his ringletclustered brows
    Seeking still to slay his lovers with his rigours unaware
 By the myrtle of his whiskers and the roses of his cheek By his lips
    incarnate rubies and his teeths fine pearls and rare
 By the straight and tender sapling of his shape which for its fruit
    Doth the twin pomegranates shining in his snowy bosom wear
 By his heavy hips that tremble both in motion and repose And the
    slender waist above them all too slight their weight to bear
 By the silk of his apparel and his quick and sprightly wit By all
    attributes of beauty that are fallen to his share
 Lo the musk exhales its fragrance from his breath and eke the breeze
    From his scent the perfume borrows that it scatters everywhere
 Yea the sun in all his splendour cannot with his brightness vie And the
    crescent moons a fragment that he from his nails doth pare

And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her
permitted say


       Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Sixtyeighth Night

She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that Nur alDin
was delighted with the girls verses and he swayed from side to side for
drunkenness and fell apraising her and saying

 A lutanist to us inclined  And stole our wits bemused with wine
 And said to us her lute The Lord  Bade us discourse by voice divine

When she heard him thus improvise the girl gazed at him with loving eyes
and redoubled in passion and desire for him increased upon her and
indeed she marvelled at his beauty and loveliness symmetry and grace
so that she could not contain herself but took the lute in lap again
and sang these couplets

 He blames me for casting on him my sight  And parts fro me bearing my
    life and sprite
 He repels me but kens what my heart endures  As though Allah himself
    had inspired the wight
 I portrayed his portrait in palm of hand  And cried to mine eyes Weep
    your doleful plight
 For neither shall eyes of me spy his like  Nor my heart have patience
    to bear its blight
 Wherefore will I tear thee from breast O Heart  As one who regards
    him with jealous spite
 And when say I O heart be consoled for pine  Tis that heart to
    none other shall eer incline

Nur alDin wondered at the charms of her verse and the elegance of her
expression and the sweetness of her voice and the eloquence of her
speech and his wit fled for stress of love and longing and ecstasy and
distraction so that he could not refrain from her a single moment but
bent to her and strained her to his bosom and she in like manner bowed
her form over his and abandoned herself to his embrace and bussed him
between the eyes Then he kissed her on the mouth and played with her at
kisses after the manner of the billing of doves and she met him with
like warmth and did with him as she was done by till the others were
distracted and rose to their feet whereupon Nur alDin was ashamed and
held his hand from her Then she took her lute and preluding thereon in
manifold modes lastly returned to the first and sang these couplets

 A Moon when he bends him those eyes lay bare  A brand that gars gazing
    gazelle despair
 A King rarest charms are the host of him  And his lancelike shape men
    with cane compare
 Were his softness of sides to his heart transferred  His friend had not
    suffered such cark and care
 Ah for hardest heart and for softest sides  Why not that to these
    alter make here go there
 O thou who accusest my love excuse  Take eternal and leave me the
    transient share

When Nur alDin heard the sweetness of her voice and the rareness of her
verse he inclined to her for delight and could not contain himself for
excess of wonderment so he recited these couplets

 Methought she was the forenoon sun until she donned the veil  But lit
    she fire in vitals mine still flaring fierce and high
 How had it hurt her an she deigned return my poor salm  With
    fingertips or een vouchsafed one little wink of eye
 The cavalier who spied her face was wholly stupefied  By charms that
    glorify the place and every charm outvie
 Be this the Fair who makes thee pine and long for love liesse  Indeed
    thou art excused This is my fairest she quoth I
 Who shot me with the shaft of looks nor deigns to rue my woes  Of
    strangerhood and broken heart and love I must aby
 I rose amorn with vanquished heart to longing love a prey  And weep I
    through the live long day and all the night I cry

The girl marvelled at his eloquence and elegance and taking her lute
smote thereon with the goodliest of performance repeating all the
melodies and sang these couplets

 By the life o thy face O thou life o my sprite  Ill neer leave
    thy love for despair or delight
 When art cruel thy vision stands hard by my side  And the thought of
    thee haunts me when far from sight
 O who saddenest my glance albe weeting that I  No love but thy love
    will for ever requite
 Thy cheeks are of Rose and thy lipsdews are wine  Say wilt grudge
    them to us in this charming site

Hereat Nur alDin was gladdened with extreme gladness and wondered with
the utmost wonder so he answered her verse with these couplets

 The sun yellowed not in the murk gloom lien  But lay pearl enveiled
    neath horizonchine
 Nor showed its crest to the eyes of Morn  But took refuge from parting
    with Morningshine
 Take my teardrops that trickle as chain on chain  And theyll tell my
    case with the clearest sign
 An my tears be likened to Nileflood like  Malaks flooded flat
    be this love o mine
 Quoth she Bring thy riches Quoth I Come take  And thy sleep
    Yes take it from lids of eyne

When the girl heard Nur alDins words and noted the beauty of his
eloquence her senses fled and her wit was dazed and love of him gat hold
upon her whole heart So she pressed him to her bosom and fell to
kissing him like the billing of doves whilst he returned her caresses
with successive kisses but preeminence appertaineth to precedence
When she had made an end of kissing she took the lute and recited these
couplets

 Alas alack and wellaway for blamers calumny  Whether or not I make
    my moan or plead or show no plea
 O spurner of my love I neer of thee so hard would deem  That I of thee
    should be despised of thee my property
 I wont at lovers love to rail and for their passion chide  But now I
    fain debase myself to all who rail at thee
 Yea only yesterday I wont all amourists to blame  But now I pardon
    hearts that pine for passions ecstacy
 And of my stress of partingstowre on me so heavy weighs  At morning
    prayer to Him Ill cry In thy name O Ali

And also these two couplets

 His lovers said Unless he deign to give us all a drink  Of wine of
    fine old wine his lips deal in their purity
 We to the Lord of Threefold Worlds will pray to grant our prayer  And
    all exclaim with single cry In thy name O Ali

Nur alDin hearing these lines and their rhyme marvelled at the
fluency of her tongue and thanked her praising her grace and passing
seductiveness and the damsel delighted at his praise arose without
stay or delay and doffing that was upon her of outer dress and trinkets
till she was free of all encumbrance sat down on his knees and kissed
him between the eyes and on his cheekmole Then she gave him all she
had put offAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying
her permitted say


        Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Sixtyninth Night

She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that the girl gave
to Nur alDin all she had doffed saying O beloved of my heart in
very sooth the gift is after the measure of the giver So he accepted
this from her and gave it back to her and kissed her on the mouth and
cheeks and eyes When this was ended and done for naught is durable
save the Living the Eternal Provider of the peacock and the owl
Nur alDin rose from the sance and stood upon his feet because the
darkness was now fallen and the stars shone out whereupon quoth the
damsel to him Whither away O my lord and quoth he To my fathers
home Then the sons of the merchants conjured him to night with them
but he refused and mounting his shemule rode without stopping till
he reached his parents house where his mother met him and said to him
O my son what hath kept thee away till this hour By Allah thou hast
troubled myself and thy sire by thine absence from us and our hearts
have been occupied with thee Then she came up to him to kiss him on
his mouth and smelling the fumes of the wine said O my son how is
it that after prayer and worship thou hast become a winebibber and a
rebel against Him to whom belong creation and commandment But Nur
alDin threw himself down on the bed and lay there Presently in came
his sire and said What aileth Nur alDin to lie thus and his mother
answered Twould seem his head acheth for the air of the garden So
Taj alDin went up to his son to ask him of his ailment and salute
him and smelt the reek of wine Now the merchant loved not
winedrinkers so he said to Nur alDin Woe to thee O my son Is
folly come to such a pass with thee that thou drinkest wine When Nur
alDin heard his sire say this he raised his hand being yet in his
drunkenness and dealt him a buffet when by decree of the Decreer the
blow lit on his fathers right eye which rolled down on his cheek
whereupon he fell aswoon and lay therein awhile They sprinkled
rosewater on him till he recovered when he would have beaten his son
but the mother withheld him and he swore by the oath of divorce from
his wife that as soon as morning morrowed he would assuredly cut off
his sons right hand When she heard her husbands words her
breast was straitened and she feared for her son and ceased not to
soothe and appease his sire till sleep overcame him Then she waited
till moonrise when she went in to her son whose drunkenness had now
departed from him and said to him O Nur alDin what is this foul
deed thou diddest with thy sire He asked And what did I with him
and answered she Thou dealtest him a buffet on the right eye and
struckest it out so that it rolled down his cheek and he hath sworn by
the divorceoath that as soon as morning shall morrow he will without
fail cut off thy right hand Nur alDin repented him of that he had
done whenas repentance profited him naught and his mother said to him
O my son this penitence will not profit thee nor will aught avail
thee but that thou arise forthwith and seek safety in flight go forth
the house privily and take refuge with one of thy friends and there what
Allah shall do await for he changeth case after case and state upon
state Then she opened a chest and taking out a purse of an hundred
dinars said O my son take these dinars and provide thy wants
therewith and when they are at an end O my son send and let me know
thereof that I may send thee other than these and at the same time
convey to me news of thyself privily haply Allah will decree thee
relief and thou shalt return to thy home And she farewelled him and
wept passing sore nought could be more Thereupon Nur alDin took the
purse of gold and was about to go forth when he espied a great purse
containing a thousand dinars which his mother had forgotten by the side
of the chest So he took this also and binding the two purses about his
middle set out before dawn threading the streets in the direction
of Blk where he arrived when day broke and all creatures arose
attesting the unity of Allah the Opener and went forth each of them upon
his several business to win that which Allah had unto him allotted
Reaching Bulak he walked on along the riverbank till he sighted a ship
with her gangway out and her four anchors made fast to the land The
folk were going up into her and coming down from her and Nur alDin
seeing some sailors there standing asked them whither they were bound
and they answered To Rosettacity Quoth he Take me with you and
quoth they Well come and welcome to thee to thee O goodly one So
he betook himself forthright to the market and buying what he needed of
vivers and bedding and covering returned to the port and went on board
the ship which was ready to sail and tarried with him but a little
while before she weighed anchor and fared on without stopping till she
reached Rosetta where Nur alDin saw a small boat going to
Alexandria So he embarked in it and traversing the seaarm of Rosetta
fared on till he came to a bridge called AlJm where he landed and
entered Alexandria by the gate called the Gate of the Lotetree Allah
protected him so that none of those who stood on guard at the gate saw
him and he walked on till he entered the cityAnd Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say


        Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Seventieth Night

She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Nur alDin
entered Alexandria he found it a city goodly of pleasaunces delightful
to its inhabitants and inviting to inhabit therein Winter had fared
from it with his cold and Prime was come to it with his roses its
flowers were kindly ripe and welled forth its rills Indeed it was a
city goodly of ordinance and disposition its folk were of the best of
men and when the gates thereof were shut its folk were safe And
it was even as is said of it in these couplets

 Quoth I to a comrade one day  A man of good speech and rar
 Describe Alexandria  Quoth he Tis a marchtown fair
 Quoth I Is there living therein  And he An the wind blow there

Or as saith one of the poets

 Alexandrias a frontier  Whose dews of lips are sweet and clear
 How fair the coming to it is  So one therein no raven speer

Nur alDin walked about the city and ceased not walking till he came to
the merchants bazar whence he passed on to the mart of the
moneychangers and so on in turn to the markets of the confectioners and
fruiterers and druggists marvelling as he went at the city for that
the nature of its qualities accorded with its name As he walked in
the druggists bazar behold an old man came down from his shop and
saluting him took him by the hand and carried him to his home And Nur
alDin saw a fair bystreet swept and sprinkled whereon the zephyr
blew and made pleasantness pervade it and the leaves of the trees
overshaded it Therein stood three houses and at the upper end a
mansion whose foundations were firm sunk in the water and its walls
towered to the confines of the sky They had swept the space before it
and they had sprinkled it freshly so it exhaled the fragrance of
flowers borne on the zephyr which breathed upon the place and the
scent met there who approached it on such wise as it were one of the
gardens of Paradise And as they had cleaned and cooled the bystreets
head so was the end of it with marble spread The Shaykh carried Nur
alDin into the house and setting somewhat of food before him ate with
his guest When they had made an end of eating the druggist said to
him When camest thou hither from Cairo and Nur alDin replied
This very night O my father Quoth the old man What is thy name
and quoth he Ali Nur alDin Said the druggist O my son O Nur
alDin be the triple divorce incumbent on me an thou leave me so long
as thou abidest in this city and I will set thee apart a place wherein
thou mayst dwell Nur alDin asked O my lord the Shaykh let me know
more of thee and the other answered Know O my son that some years
ago I went to Cairo with merchandise which I sold there and bought
other and I had occasion for a thousand dinars So thy sire Taj alDin
weighed them out for me all unknowing me and would take no
written word of me but had patience with me till I returned hither and
sent him the amount by one of my servants together with a gift I saw
thee whilst thou wast little and if it please Allah the Most High I
will repay thee somewhat of the kindness thy father did me When Nur
alDin heard the old mans story he showed joy and pulling out with a
smile the purse of a thousand dinars gave it to his host the Shaykh and
said to him Take charge of this deposit for me against I buy me
somewhat of merchandise whereon to trade Then he abode some time in
Alexandria city taking his pleasure every day in its thoroughfares
eating and drinking and indulging himself with mirth and merriment till
he had made an end of the hundred dinars he had kept by way of
spendingmoney whereupon he repaired to the old druggist to take of
him somewhat of the thousand dinars to spend but found him not in his
shop and took a seat therein to await his return He sat there gazing
right and left and amusing himself with watching the merchants and
passersby and as he was thus engaged behold there came into the bazar
a Persian riding on a shemule and carrying behind him a damsel as she
were argent of alloy free or a fish Balti in mimic sea or a
doegazelle on desert lea Her face outshone the sun in shine and she
had witching eyne and breasts of ivory white teeth of marguerite
slender waist and sides dimpled deep and calves like tails of fat
sheep and indeed she was perfect in beauty and loveliness elegant
stature and symmetrical grace even as saith one describing her

 Twas as by will of her she was create  Nor short nor long but
    Beautys mould and mate
 Rose blushes reddest when she sees those cheeks  And fruits the bough
    those marvel charms amate
 Moon is her favour Musk the scent of her  Branch is her shapeshe
    passeth mans estate
 Tis een as were she cast in freshest pearl  And every limblet shows a
    moon innate

Presently the Persian lighted down from his shemule and making the
damsel also dismount loudly summoned the broker and said to him as soon
as he came Take this damsel and cry her for sale in the market So he
took her and leading her to the middlemost of the bazar disappeared for
a while and presently he returned with a stool of ebony inlaid with
ivory and setting it upon the ground seated her thereon Then he
raised her veil and discovered a face as it were a Median targe or
a cluster of pearls and indeed she was like the full moon when it
filleth on its fourteenth night accomplished in brilliant beauty As
saith the poet

 Vied the full moon for folly with her face  But was eclipsed and
    split for rage full sore
 And if the spiring Bn with her contend  Perish her hands who load of
    fuel bore

And how well saith another

 Say to the fair in the wroughten veil  How hast made that monklike
    worshipper ail

 Light of veil and light of face under it  Made the hosts of darkness to
    fly from bale
 And when came my glance to steal look at cheek  With a meteorshaft
    the Guard made me quail

Then said the broker to the merchants How much do ye bid for the
unionpearl of the diver and prizequarry of the fowler Quoth one
She is mine for an hundred dinars And another said Two hundred
and a third Three hundred and they ceased not to bid one against
other till they made her price nine hundred and fifty dinars and there
the biddings stopped awaiting acceptance and consentAnd
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say


       Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Seventyfirst Night

She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the merchants bid
one against other till they made the price of the girl nine hundred and
fifty dinars Then the broker went up to her Persian master and said to
him The biddings for this thy slavegirl have reached nine hundred and
fifty dinars so say me wilt thou sell her at that price and take the
money Asked the Persian Doth she consent to this I desire to fall
in with her wishes for I sickened on my journey hither and this
handmaid tended me with all possible tenderness wherefore I sware not
to sell her but to him whom she should like and approve and I have put
her sale in her own hand So do thou consult her and if she say I
consent sell her to whom thou wilt but an she say No sell her not
So the broker went up to her and asked her O Princess of fair ones
know that thy master putteth thy sale in thine own hands and thy price
hath reached nine hundred and fifty dinars dost thou give me leave to
sell thee She answered Show me him who is minded to buy me before
clinching the bargain So he brought her up to one of the merchants a
man stricken with years and decrepit and she looked at him a long
while then turned to the broker and said to him O broker art thou
Jinnmad or afflicted in thy wit Replied he Why dost thou ask me
this O Princess of fair ones and said she Is it permitted thee of
Allah to sell the like of me to yonder decrepit old man who saith of
his wifes case these couplets

 Quoth she to meand sore enraged for wounded pride was she  For she
    in sooth had bidden me to that which might not be
 An if thou swive me not forthright as one should swive his wife 
    Thou be made a cuckold straight reproach it not to me
 Meseems thy yard is made of wax for very flaccidness  For when I rub
    it with my hand it softens instantly

And said he likewise of his yard

 I have a yard that sleeps in base and shameful way  When grants my
    lover boon for which I sue and pray
 But when I wake o mornings all alone in bed  Tis fain o foin
    and fence and fierce for futterplay

And again quoth he thereof of his yard

 I have a froward yard of temper ill  Dishonouring him who shows it most
    regard
 It stands when sleep I when I stand it sleeps  Heaven pity not who
    pitieth that yard

When the old merchant heard this ill flouting from the damsel he was
wroth with wrath exceeding beyond which was no proceeding and said to
the broker O most illomened of brokers thou hast not brought into
the market this illconditioned wench but to gibe me and make mock of me
before the merchants Then the broker took her aside and said to her
O my lady be not wanting in selfrespect The Shaykh at whom thou
didst mock is the Syndic of the bazar and Inspector thereof and a
committeeman of the council of the merchants But she laughed and
improvised these two couplets

 It behoveth folk who rule in our time  And tis one of the duties of
    magistrateship
 To hang up the Wali above his door  And beat with a whip the Mohtasib

Adding By Allah O my lord I will not be sold to yonder old man so
sell me to other than him for haply he will be abashed at me and vend
me again and I shall become a mere servant and it beseemeth not
that I sully myself with menial service and indeed thou knowest that
the matter of my sale is committed to myself He replied I hear and I
obey and carried her to a man which was one of the chief merchants
And when standing hard by him the broker asked How sayst thou O my
lady Shall I sell thee to my lord Sharf alDn here for nine hundred
and fifty gold pieces She looked at him and seeing him to be an old
man with a dyed beard said to the broker Art thou silly that thou
wouldst sell me to this worn out Father Antic Am I cotton refuse or
threadbare rags that thou marchest me about from greybeard to greybeard
each like a wall ready to fall or an Ifrit smitten down of a fireball
As for the first the poet had him in mind when he said

 I sought of a fair maid to kiss her lips of coral red But No by Him
    who fashioned things from nothingness she said
 Unto the white of hoary hairs I never had a mind And shall my mouth be
    stuffed forsooth with cotton ere Im dead

And how goodly is the saying of the poet

 The wise have said that white of hair is light that shines and robes 
    The face of man with majesty and light that awes the sight
 Yet until hoary seal shall stamp my partingplace of hair  I hope and
    pray that same may be black as the blackest night
 Albe Timewhitened beard of man be like the book he bears  When to
    his Lord he must return Id rather twere not white

And yet goodlier is the saying of another

 A guest hath stolen on my head and honour may he lack  The sword a
    milder deed hath done that dared these locks to hack
 Avaunt O Whiteness wherein naught of brightness gladdens sight 
    Thou rt blacker in the eyes of me than very blackest black

As for the other he is a model of wantonness and scurrilousness and a
blackener of the face of hoariness his dye acteth the foulest of lies
and the tongue of his case reciteth these lines

 Quoth she to me I see thou dyst thy hoariness and I I do but hide
    it from thy sight O thou mine ear and eye
 She laughed out mockingly and said A wonder tis indeed Thou so
    aboundest in deceit that even thy hairs a lie

And how excellent is the saying of the poet

 O thou who dyest hoariness with black  That youth wi thee abide at
    least in show
 Look ye my lot was dyd black whilome  And take my word none other
    hue twill grow

When the old man with dyed beard heard such words from the slavegirl
he raged with exceeding rage in furys last stage and said to the
broker O most illomened of brokers this day thou hast brought to our
market naught save this gibing baggage to flout at all who are therein
one after other and fleer at them with flyting verse and idle jest
And he came down from his shop and smote on the face the broker who took
her an angered and carried her away saying to her By Allah never in
my life saw I a more shameless wench than thyself Thou hast cut
off my daily bread and thine own this day and all the merchants will
bear me a grudge on thine account Then they saw on the way a merchant
called Shihab alDn who bid ten dinars more for her and the broker
asked her leave to sell her to him Quoth she Trot him out that I may
see him and question him of a certain thing which if he have in his
house I will be sold to him and if not then not So the broker left
her standing there and going up to Shihab alDin said to him O my
lord know that yonder damsel tells me she hath a mind to ask thee
somewhat which an thou have she will be sold to thee Now thou hast
heard what she said to thy fellows the merchantsAnd Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say


      Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Seventysecond Night

She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that the broker
said to the merchant Thou hast heard what this handmaid said to thy
fellows the traders and by Allah I fear to bring her to thee lest
she do with thee like as she did with thy neighbours and so I fall into
disgrace with thee but an thou bid me bring her to thee I will bring
her Quoth the merchant Hither with her to me Hearing and
obeying answered the broker and fetched for the purchaser the damsel
who looked at him and said O my lord Shihab alDin hast thou in thy
house round cushions stuffed with ermine strips Replied Shihab alDin
Yes O Princess of fair ones I have at home half a score such
cushions but I conjure thee by Allah tell me what will thou do with
them Quoth she I will bear with thee till thou be asleep when I
will lay them on thy mouth and nose and press them down till thou die
Then she turned to the broker and said to him O thou refuse of
brokers meseemeth thou art mad in that thou showest me this hour past
first to a pair of greybeards in each of whom are two faults and then
thou proferrest me to my lord Shihab alDin wherein be three defects
firstly he is dwarfish secondly he hath a nose which is big and
thirdly he hath a beard which is long Of him quoth one of the poets

 We never heard of wight nor yet espied  Who amid men three gifts hath
    unified
 To wit a beard one cubit long a snout  Spanlong and figure tall a
    finger wide

And quoth another poet

 From the plain of his face springs a minaret  Like a bezel of ring on
    his finger set
 Did creation enter that vasty nose  No created thing would elsewhere be
    met

When Shihab alDin heard this he came down from his shop and seized the
broker by the collar saying O scurviest of brokers what aileth thee
to bring us a damsel to flout and make mock of us one after other with
her verses and talk that a curse is So the broker took her and carried
her away from before him and fared saying By Allah all my life long
since I have plied this profession never set I eyes on the like of thee
for unmannerliness nor aught more curst to me than thy star for thou
hast cut off my livelihood this day and I have gained no profit by thee
save cuffs on the necknape and catching by the collar Then he brought
her to the shop of another merchant owner of negro slaves and white
servants and stationing her before him said to her Wilt thou be sold
to this my lord Al alDn She looked at him and seeing him
humpbacked said This is a Gobbo and quoth the poet of him

 Drawn in thy shoulders are and spine thrust out  As seeking star which
    Satan gave the lout
 Or as he tasted had first smack of scourge  And looked in marvel for a
    second bout

And saith another on the same theme

 As one of you who mounted mule  A sight for men to ridicule
 Ist not a farce Who feels surprise  An start and bolt with him the
    mule

And another on a similar subject

 Oft hunchback addeth to his bunchy back  Faults which gar folk upon his
    front look black
 Like branch distort and dried by length of days  With citrons hanging
    from it loose and slack

With this the broker hurried up to her and carrying her to another
merchant said to her Wilt thou be sold to this one She looked at
him and said In very sooth this man is blueeyed how wilt thou
sell me to him Quoth one of the poets

        His eyelids sore and bleared  Weakness of frame denote
        Arise ye folk and see  Within his eyes the mote

Then the broker carried her to another and she looked at him and seeing
that he had a long beard said to the broker Fie upon thee This is a
ram whose tail hath sprouted from his gullet Wilt thou sell me to him
O unluckiest of brokers Hast thou not heard sayAll long of beard are
little of wits Indeed after the measure of the length of the beard is
the lack of sense and this is a wellknown thing among men of
understanding As saith one of the poets

 Neer was a man with beard grown overlong  Tho be he therefor
    reverenced and feard
 But who the shortness noted in his wits  Added to longness noted in his
    beard

And quoth another

 I have a friend with a beard which God hath made to grow to a useless
    length
 It is like unto one of the nights of winter long and dark and cold

With this the broker took her and turned away with her and she asked
Whither goest thou with me He answered Back to thy master the
Persian it sufficeth me what hath befallen me because of thee this day
for thou hast been the means of spoiling both my trade and his by thine
ill manners Then she looked about the market right and left front and
rear till by the decree of the Decreer her eyes fell on Ali Nur alDin
the Cairene So she gazed at him and saw him to be a comely youth
of straight slim form and smooth of face fourteen years old rare in
beauty and loveliness and elegance and amorous grace like the full moon
on the fourteenth night with forehead flowerwhite and cheeks rosy red
neck like alabaster and teeth than jewels finer and dews of lips sweeter
than sugar even as saith of him one of his describers

 Came to match him in beauty and loveliness rare  Full moons and
    gazelles but quoth I Soft fare
 Fare softly gazelles nor yourselves compare  With him and O Moons
    all your pains forbear

And how well saith another bard

 Slimwaisted loveling from his hair and brow  Men wake amorn in night
    and light renewed
 Blame not the mole that dwelleth on his cheek  For Nuumans bloom aye
    shows spot negrohued

When the slavegirl beheld Nur alDin he interposed between her and her
wits she fell in love to him with a great and sudden fall and her heart
was taken with affection for himAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of
day and ceased saying her permitted say


       Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Seventythird Night

She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the
slavegirl beheld Nur alDin her heart was taken with affection for
him so she turned to the broker and said to him Will not yonder young
merchant who is sitting among the traders in the gown of striped
broadcloth bid somewhat more for me The broker replied O lady of
fair ones yonder young man is a stranger from Cairo where his father
is chief of the traderguild and surpasseth all the merchants and
notables of the place He is but lately come to this our city and
lodgeth with one of his fathers friends but he hath made no bid for
thee nor more nor less When the girl heard the brokers words she
drew from her finger a costly signetring of ruby and said to the man
Carry me to yonder youth and if he buy me this ring shall be thine
in requital of thy travail with me this day The broker rejoiced at
this and brought her up to Nur alDin and she considered him straitly
and found him like the full moon perfect in loveliness and a model of
fine stature and symmetric grace even as saith of him one of his
describers

 Waters of beauty oer his cheeks flow bright  And rain his glances
    shafts that sorely smite
 Choked are his lovers an he deal disdains  Bitterest draught denaying
    lovedelight
 His forehead and his stature and my love  Are perfect perfected
    perfectiondight
 His raiment folds enfold a lovely neck  As crescent moon in collar
    buttoned tight
 His eyne and twinnd moles and tears of me  Are night that nighteth to
    the nightliest night

 His eyebrows and his features and my frame  Crescents on crescents
    are as crescents slight
 His pupils pass the winecup to his friends  Which albe sweet tastes
    bitter to my sprite
 And to my thirsty throat pure drink he dealt  From smiling lips what
    day we were unite
 Then is my blood to him my death to him  His right and rightful and
    most righteous right

The girl gazed at Nur alDin and said O my lord Allah upon thee am I
not beautiful and he replied O Princess of fair ones is there in
the world a comelier than thou She rejoined Then why seest thou all
the other merchants bid high for me and art silent nor sayest a word
neither addest one dinar to my price Twould seem I please thee not O
my lord Quoth he O my lady were I in my own land I had bought thee
with all that my hand possesseth of monies and quoth she O my lord
I said not Buy me against thy will yet didst thou but add somewhat to
my price it would hearten my heart though thou buy me not so the
merchants may sayWere not this girl handsome yonder merchant of Cairo
had not bidden for her for the Cairenes are connoisseurs in
slavegirls These words abashed Nur alDin and he blushed and said to
the broker How high are the biddings for her He replied Her price
hath reached nine hundred and sixty dinars besides brokerage as
for the Sultans dues they fall on the seller Quoth Nur alDin Let
me have her for a thousand dinars brokerage and price And the damsel
hastening to the fore and leaving the broker said I sell myself to
this handsome young man for a thousand dinars But Nur alDin held his
peace Quoth one We sell to him and another He deserveth her and
a third Accursed son of accursed is he who biddeth and doth not
buy and a fourth By Allah they befit each other Then before Nur
alDin could think the broker fetched Kazis and witnesses who wrote
out a contract of sale and purchase and the broker handed the paper to
Nur alDin saying Take thy slavegirl and Allah bless thee in her for
she beseemeth none but thee and none but thou beseemeth her And he
recited these two couplets

 Boon Fortune sought him in humblest way  And came to him
    draggletailed all astir
 And none is fittest for him but she  And none is fittest but he for
    her

Hereat Nur alDin was abashed before the merchants so he arose without
stay or delay and weighed out the thousand dinars which he had left as a
deposit with his fathers friend the druggist and taking the girl
carried her to the house wherein the Shaykh had lodged him When she
entered and saw nothing but ragged patched carpets and worn out rugs
she said to him O my lord have I no value to thee and am I not worthy
that thou shouldst bear me to thine own house and home wherein are thy
goods that thou bringest me into thy servants lodging Why dost thou
not carry me to thy fathers dwelling He replied By Allah O
Princess of fair ones this is my house wherein I dwell but it
belongeth to an old man a druggist of this city who hath set it apart
for me and lodged me therein I told thee that I was a stranger and that
I am of the sons of Cairo city She rejoined O my lord the least of
houses sufficeth till thy return to thy native place but Allah upon
thee O my lord go now and fetch us somewhat of roast meat and wine and
dried fruit and dessert Quoth Nur alDin By Allah O Princess of
fair ones I had no money with me but the thousand dinars I paid down to
thy price nor possess I any other good The few dirhams I owned were
spent by me yesterday Quoth she Hast thou no friend in the town of
whom thou mayst borrow fifty dirhams and bring them to me that I may
tell thee what thou shalt do therewith And he said I have no
intimate but the druggist Then he betook himself forthright to the
druggist and said to him Peace be with thee O uncle He returned his
salam and said to him O my son what hast thou bought for a thousand
dinars this day Nur alDin replied I have bought a slavegirl and
the oldster rejoined O my son art thou mad that thou givest a
thousand dinars for one slavegirl Would I knew what kind of slavegirl
she is Said Nur alDin She is a damsel of the children of the
FranksAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her
permitted say


      Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Seventyfourth Night

She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that Nur alDin said
to the ancient druggist The damsel is of the children of the Franks
and the Shaykh said O my son the best of the girls of the Franks are
to be had in this our town for an hundred dinars and by Allah O my
son they have cheated thee in the matter of this damsel However an
thou have taken a fancy to her lie with her this night and do thy will
of her and tomorrow morning go down with her to the market and sell
her though thou lose by her two hundred dinars and reckon that thou
hast lost them by shipwreck or hast been robbed of them on the road
Nur alDin replied Right is thy rede O uncle but thou knowest that I
had but the thousand dinars wherewith I purchased the damsel and now I
have not a single dirham left to spend so I desire of thy favour and
bounty that thou lend me fifty dirhams to provide me withal till
tomorrow when I will sell her and repay thee out of her price Said
the old man Willingly O my son and counted out to him the fifty
dirhams Then he said to him O my son thou art but young in years and
the damsel is fair so belike thy heart will be taken with her and it
will be grievous to thee to vend her Now thou hast nothing to live on
and these fifty dirhams will readily be spent and thou wilt come to me
and I shall lend thee once and twice and thrice and so on up to ten
times but an thou come to me after this I will not return thy
salam and our friendship with thy father will end ill Nur alDin
took the fifty dirhams and returned with them to the damsel who said to
him O my lord wend thee at once to the market and fetch me twenty
dirhams worth of stained silk of five colours and with the other thirty
buy meat and bread and fruit and wine and flowers So he went to the
market and purchasing for her all she sought brought it to her
whereupon she rose and tucking up her sleeves cooked food after the
most skilful fashion and set it before him He ate and she ate with
him till they had enough after which she set on the wine and she
drank and he drank and she ceased not to ply him with drink and
entertain him with discourse till he became drunken and fell asleep
Thereupon she arose without stay or delay and taking out of her bundle a
budget of Tif leather opened it and drew forth a pair of knitting
needles wherewith she fell to work and stinted not till she had made a
beautiful zone which she folded up in a wrapper after cleaning it and
ironing it and laid it under her pillow Then she doffed her dress till
she was mothernaked and lying down beside Nur alDin shampood him till
he awoke from his heavy sleep He found by his side a maiden like virgin
silver softer than silk and delicater than a tail of fatted sheep than
standard more conspicuous and goodlier than the red camel in
height five feet tall with breasts firm and full brows like bended
bows eyes like gazelles eyes and cheeks like bloodred anemones a
slender waist with dimples laced and a navel holding an ounce of the
unguent benzoin thighs like bolsters stuffed with ostrichdown and
between them what the tongue fails to set forth and at mention whereof
the tears jet forth Brief it was as it were she to whom the poet
alluded in these two couplets

 From her hair is Night from her forehead Noon  From her sideface
    Rose from her lip wine boon
 From her Union Heaven her Severance Hell  Pearls from her teeth from
    her front full Moon

And how excellent is the saying of another bard

 A Moon she rises Willowwand she waves  Breathes ambergris and gazeth
    a gazelle
 Meseems that sorrow wooes my heart and wins  And when she wends makes
    haste therein to dwell
 Her face is fairer than the Stars of Wealth  And sheeny brows the
    crescent Moon excel

And quoth a third also

 They shine fullest Moons unveil Crescentbright  Sway tenderest
    Branches and turn wild kine
 Mid which is a Darkeyed for love of whose charms  The Sailors
    would joy to be ground lowlien

So Nur alDin turned to her at once and clasping her to his bosom
sucked first her upper lip and then her under lip and slid his tongue
between the twain into her mouth Then he rose to her and found her a
pearl unthridden and a filly none but he had ridden So he abated her
maidenhead and had of her amorous delight and there was knitted between
them a lovebond which might never know breach nor severance He
rained upon her cheeks kisses like the falling of pebbles into water
and struck with stroke upon stroke like the thrusting of spears in
battle brunt for that Nur alDin still yearned after clipping of necks
and sucking of lips and letting down of tress and pressing of waist and
biting of cheek and cavalcading on breast with Cairene buckings and
Yamani wrigglings and Abyssinian sobbings and Hind pamoisons and Nubian
lasciviousness and Rf legliftings and Damiettan moanings and
Sad hotness and Alexandrian languishment and this damsel
united in herself all these virtues together with excess of beauty and
loveliness and indeed she was even as saith of her the poet

 This is she I will never forget till I die  Nor draw near but to those
    who to her draw nigh
 A being for semblance like Moon at full  Praise her Maker her Modeller
    glorify
 Tho be sore my sin seeking loveliesse  On esperanceday neer repent
    can I
 A couplet reciting which none can know  Save the youth who in couplets
    and rhymes shall cry
 None weeteth love but who bears its load  Nor passion save pleasures
    and pains he aby

So Nur alDin lay with the damsel through the night in solace and
delightAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her
permitted say


       Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Seventyfifth Night

She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Nur alDin lay
with that damsel through the night in solace and delight the twain
garbed in the closely buttoned garments of embrace safe and secure
against the misways of nights and days and they passed the dark hours
after the goodliest fashion fearing naught in their joys lovefraught
from excess of talk and prate As saith of them the right excellent
poet

       Go visit her thou lovest and regard not
       The words detractors utter envious churls
       Can never favour love Oh sure the merciful
       Neer make a thing more fair to look upon
       Then two fond lovers in each others arms
       Speaking their passion in a mute embrace
       When heart has turned to heart the fools would part them
       Strike idly on cold steel So when thoust found
       One purely wholly thine accept her true heart
       And live for her alone Oh thou that blamest
       The lovestruck for their love give oer thy talk
       How canst thou minister to a mind diseased

When the morning morrowed in sheen and shone Nur alDin awoke from deep
sleep and found that she had brought water so they made the
Ghuslablution he and she and he performed that which behoved him of
prayer to his Lord after which she set before him meat and drink and
he ate and drank Then the damsel put her hand under her pillow and
pulling out the girdle which she had knitted during the night gave it
to Nur alDin who asked Whence cometh this girdle Answered
she O my lord tis the silk thou boughtest yesterday for twenty
dirhams Rise now and go to the Persian bazar and give it to the broker
to cry for sale and sell it not for less than twenty gold pieces in
ready money Quoth Nur alDin O Princess of fair ones how can a
thing that cost twenty dirhams and will sell for as many dinars be
made in a single night and quoth she O my lord thou knowest not
the value of this thing but go to the market therewith and give it to
the broker and when he shall cry it its worth will be made manifest to
thee Herewith he carried the zone to the market and gave it to the
broker bidding him cry it whilst he himself sat down on a masonry
bench before a shop The broker fared forth and returning after a while
said to him O my lord rise take the price of thy zone for it hath
fetched twenty dinars money down When Nur alDin heard this he
marvelled with exceeding marvel and shook with delight Then he rose
between belief and misbelief to take the money and when he had received
it he went forthright and spent it all on silk of various colours and
returning home gave his purchase to the damsel saying Make this all
into girdles and teach me likewise how to make them that I may work
with thee for never in the length of my life saw I a fairer craft than
this craft nor a more abounding in gain and profit By Allah tis
better than the trade of a merchant a thousand times She laughed at
his language and said O my lord go to thy friend the druggist and
borrow other thirty dirhams of him and tomorrow repay him from the
price of the girdle the thirty together with the fifty already loaned to
thee So he rose and repaired to the druggist and said to him O
Uncle lend me other thirty dirhams and tomorrow Almighty Allah
willing I will repay thee the whole fourscore The old man weighed him
out thirty dirhams wherewith he went to the market and buying meat and
bread dried fruits and flowers as before carried them home to the
damsel whose name was Miriam the Girdlegirl She rose forthright
and making ready rich meats set them before her lord Nur alDin after
which she brought the wineservice and they drank and plied each other
with drink When the wine began to play with their wits his pleasant
address and inner grace pleased her and she recited these two
couplets

 Said I to Slimwaist who the wine engraced  Brought in muskscented
    bowl and a superfine
 Was it prest from thy cheek He replied Nay nay  When did man from
    Roses eer press the Wine

And the damsel ceased not to carouse with her lord and ply him with cup
and bowl and require him to fill for her and give her to drink of that
which sweeteneth the spirits and whenever he put forth hand to her she
drew back from him out of coquetry The wine added to her beauty and
loveliness and Nur alDin recited these two couplets

 Slimwaist craved wine from her companeer  Cried in meeting of
    friends when he feared for his fere
 An thou pass not the wine thou shalt pass the night  Abanisht my
    bed And he felt sore fear

They ceased not drinking till drunkenness overpowered Nur alDin and he
slept whereupon she rose forthright and fell to work upon a zone as
was her wont When she had wrought it to end she wrapped it in paper
and doffing her clothes lay down by his side and enjoyed dalliance and
delight till morn appearedAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased to say her permitted say


       Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Seventysixth Night

She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that Miriam the
Girdlegirl having finished her zone and wrapped it in paper doffed her
dress and lay down by the side of her lord and then happened to them
what happened of dalliance and delight and he did his devoir like a
man On the morrow she gave him the girdle and said to him Carry this
to the market and sell it for twenty dinars even as thou soldest its
fellow yesterday So he went to the bazar and sold the girdle for
twenty dinars after which he repaired to the druggist and paid him back
the eighty dirhams thanking him for his bounties and calling down
blessings upon him He asked O my son hast thou sold the damsel
and Nur alDin answered Wouldst thou have me sell the soul out of my
body and told him all that had passed from commencement to
conclusion whereat the druggist joyed with joy galore than which could
be no more and said to him By Allah O my son thou gladdenest me
Inshallah mayst thou ever be in prosperity Indeed I wish thee well by
reason of my affection for thy father and the continuance of my
friendship with him Then Nur alDin left the Shaykh and straightway
going to the market bought meat and fruit and wine and all that he
needed according to his custom and returned therewith to Miriam They
abode thus a whole year in eating and drinking and mirth and merriment
and love and good comradeship and every night she made a zone and he
sold it on the morrow for twenty dinars wherewith he bought their needs
and gave the rest to her to keep against a time of necessity After the
twelvemonth she said to him one day O my lord whenas thou sellest the
girdle tomorrow buy for me with its price silk of six colours because
I am minded to make thee a kerchief to wear on thy shoulders such as
never son of merchant no nor Kings son ever rejoiced in its like
So next day he fared forth to the bazar and after selling the zone
brought her the dyed silks she sought and Miriam the Girdlegirl wrought
at the Kerchief a whole week for every night when she had made an end
of the zone she would work awhile at the kerchief till it was finished
Then she gave it to Nur alDin who put it on his shoulders and went out
to walk in the marketplace whilst all the merchants and folk and
notables of the town crowded about him to gaze on his beauty and that
of the kerchief which was of the most beautiful Now it chanced that one
night after this he awoke from sleep and found Miriam weeping passing
sore and reciting these couplets

 Nears my parting fro my love nigher draws the Severanceday  Ah
    wellaway for parting and again ah wellaway
 And in tway is torn my heart and O pine Im doomed to bear  For the
    nights that erst witnessd our pleasurable play
 No help for it but Envier the twain of us espy  With evil eye and win
    to us his lamentable way
 For naught to us is sorer than the jealousy of men  And the backbiters
    eyne that with calumny affray

He said O my lady Miriam what aileth thee to weep and she
replied I weep for the anguish of parting for my heart presageth me
thereof Quoth he O lady of fair ones and who shall interpose
between us seeing that I love thee above all creatures and tender thee
the most and quoth she And I love thee twice as well as thou me
but fair opinion of fortune still garreth folk fall into affliction and
right well saith the poet

   Thinkst thou thyself all prosperous in days which prosprous be
   Nor fearest thou impending ill which comes by Heavens decree
   We see the orbs of heavn above how numberless they are
   But sun and moon alone eclipsd and neer a lesser star
   And many a tree on earth we see some bare some leafy green
   Of them not one is hurt with stone save that has fruitful been
   Seest not th refluent ocean bear carrion on its tide
   While pearls beneath its wavy flow fixed in the deep abide

Presently she added O my lord Nur alDin an thou desire to nonsuit
separation be on thy guard against a swartvisaged oldster blind of
the right eye and lame of the left leg for he it is who will be the
cause of our severance I saw him enter the city and I opine that he is
come hither in quest of me Replied Nur alDin O lady of fair ones
if my eyes light on him I will slay him and make an example of him
Rejoined she O my lord slay him not but talk not nor trade with him
neither buy nor sell with him nor sit nor walk with him nor speak one
word to him no not even the answer prescribed by law and I pray
Allah to preserve us from his craft and his mischief Next morning Nur
alDin took the zone and carried it to the market where he sat down on
a shopbench and talked with the sons of the merchants till the
drowsiness preceding slumber overcame him and he lay down on the bench
and fell asleep Presently behold up came the Frank whom the damsel
had described to him in company with seven others and seeing Nur
alDin lying asleep on the bench with his head wrapped in the kerchief
which Miriam had made for him and the edge thereof in his grasp sat
down by him and hent the end of the kerchief in hand and examined it
turning it over for some time Nur alDin sensed that there was
something and awoke then seeing the very man of whom Miriam had warned
him sitting by his side cried out at him with a great cry which
startled him Quoth the Frank What aileth thee to cry out thus at us
Have we taken from thee aught and quoth Nur alDin By Allah O
accursed haddest thou taken aught from me I would carry thee before
the Chief of Police Then said the Frank O Moslem I conjure thee by
thy faith and by that wherein thou believest inform me whence thou
haddest this kerchief and Nur alDin replied Tis the handiwork of
my lady motherAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased
saying her permitted say


      Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Seventyseventh Night

She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the Frank
asked Nur alDin anent the maker of the kerchief he answered saying
In very sooth this kerchief is the handiwork of my mother who made it
for me with her own hand Quoth the Frank Wilt thou sell it to me and
take ready money for it and quoth Nur alDin By Allah I will not
sell it to thee or to any else for she made none other than it Sell
it to me and I will give thee to its price this very moment five hundred
dinars money down and let her who made it make thee another and a
finer I will not sell it at all for there is not the like of it in
this city O my lord wilt thou sell it for six hundred ducats of fine
gold And the Frank went on to add to his offer hundred by hundred
till he bid nine hundred dinars but Nur alDin said Allah will open
to me otherwise than by my vending it I will never sell it not for two
thousand dinars nor more than that no never The Frank ceased not to
tempt him with money till he bid him a thousand dinars and the
merchants present said We sell thee the kerchief at that price
pay down the money Quoth Nur alDin I will not see it I swear by
Allah But one of the merchants said to him Know thou O my son
that the value of this kerchief is an hundred dinars at most and that to
an eager purchaser and if this Frank pay thee down a thousand for it
thy profit will be nine hundred dinars and what gain canst thou desire
greater than this gain Wherefore tis my rede that thou sell him this
kerchief at that price and bid her who wrought it make thee other finer
than it so shalt thou profit nine hundred dinars by this accursed
Frank the enemy of Allah and of The Faith Nur alDin was abashed at
the merchants and sold the kerchief to the Frank who in their
presence paid him down the thousand dinars with which he would have
returned to his handmaid to congratulate her on what had passed but the
stranger said Harkye O company of merchants stop my lord Nur alDin
for you and he are my guests this night I have a jar of old Greek wine
and a fat lamb fresh fruit flowers and confections wherefore do ye
all cheer me with your company tonight and not one of you tarry
behind So the merchants said O my lord Nur alDin we desire that
thou be with us on the like of this night so we may talk together we
and thou and we pray thee of thy favour and bounty to bear us
company so we and thou may be the guests of this Frank for he is a
liberal man And they conjured him by the oath of divorce and
hindered him by main force from going home Then they rose forthright
and shutting up their shops took Nur alDin and fared with the Frank
who brought them to a goodly and spacious saloon wherein were two
dases Here he made them sit and set before them a scarlet traycloth
of goodly workmanship and unique handiwork wroughten in gold with
figures of breaker and broken lover and beloved asker and asked
whereon he ranged precious vessels of porcelain and crystal full of the
costliest confections fruits and flowers and brought them a flagon of
old Greek wine Then he bade slaughter a fat lamb and kindling fire
proceeded to roast of its flesh and feed the merchants therewith and
give them draughts of that wine winking at them the while to ply Nur
alDin with drink Accordingly they ceased not plying him with wine till
he became drunken and took leave of his wits so when the Frank saw that
he was drowned in liquor he said to him O my lord Nur alDin thou
gladdenest us with thy company tonight welcome and again welcome to
thee Then he engaged him awhile in talk till he could draw near to
him when he said with dissembling speech O my lord Nur alDin wilt
thou sell me thy slavegirl whom thou boughtest in presence of these
merchants a year ago for a thousand dinars I will give thee at this
moment five thousand gold pieces for her and thou wilt thus make four
thousand ducats profit Nur alDin refused but the Frank ceased not to
ply him with meat and drink and lure him with lucre still adding to his
offers till he bid him ten thousand dinars for her whereupon Nur
alDin in his drunkenness said before the merchants I sell her to
thee for ten thousand dinars hand over the money At this the Frank
rejoiced with joy exceeding and took the merchants to witness the sale
They passed the night in eating and drinking mirth and merriment till
the morning when the Frank cried out to his pages saying Bring me
the money So they brought it to him and he counted out ten thousand
dinars to Nur alDin saying O my lord take the price of thy
slavegirl whom thou soldest to me last night in the presence of these
Moslem merchants Replied Nur alDin O accursed I sold thee nothing
and thou liest anent me for I have no slavegirls Quoth the Frank
In very sooth thou didst sell her to me and these merchants were
witnesses to the bargain Thereupon all said Yes indeed thou
soldest him thy slavegirl before us for ten thousand dinars O Nur
alDin and we will all bear witness against thee of the sale Come take
the money and deliver him the girl and Allah will give thee a better
than she in her stead Doth it irk thee O Nur alDin that thou
boughtest the girl for a thousand dinars and hast enjoyed for a year and
a half her beauty and loveliness and taken thy fill of her converse and
her favours Furthermore thou hast gained some ten thousand golden
dinars by the sale of the zones which she made thee every day and thou
soldest for twenty sequins and after all this thou hast sold her again
at a profit of nine thousand dinars over and above her original price
And withal thou deniest the sale and belittlest and makest difficulties
about the profit What gain is greater than this gain and what profit
wouldst thou have profitabler than this profit An thou love her thou
hast had thy fill of her all this time so take the money and buy thee
another handsomer than she or we will marry thee to one of our
daughters lovelier than she at a dowry of less than half this price
and the rest of the money will remain in thy hand as capital And the
merchants ceased not to ply him with persuasion and specious arguments
till he took the ten thousand dinars the price of the damsel and the
Frank straightway fetched Kazis and witnesses who drew up the contract
of sale by Nur alDin of the handmaid hight Miriam the Girdlegirl Such
was his case but as regards the damsels she sat awaiting her lord
from morning till sundown and from sundown till the noon of night and
when he returned not she was troubled and wept with sore weeping The
old druggist heard her sobbing and sent his wife who went in to her and
finding her in tears said to her O my lady what aileth thee to
weep Said she O my mother I have sat waiting the return of my lord
Nur alDin all day but he cometh not and I fear lest some one have
played a trick on him to make him sell me and he have fallen into the
snare and sold meAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased
to say her permitted say


      Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Seventyeighth Night

She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that Miriam the
Girdlegirl said to the druggists wife I am fearful lest some one
have been playing a trick on my lord to make him sell me and he have
fallen into the snare and sold me Said the other O my lady Miriam
were they to give thy lord this hall full of gold as thy price yet
would he not sell thee for what I know of his love to thee But O my
lady belike there be a company come from his parents at Cairo and he
hath made them an entertainment in the lodging where they alighted
being ashamed to bring them hither for that the place is not spacious
enough for them or because their condition is less than that he should
bring them to his own house or belike he preferred to conceal thine
affair from them so passed the night with them and Inshallah
tomorrow he will come to thee safe and sound So burden not thy soul
with cark and care O my lady for of a certainty this is the cause of
his absence from thee last night and I will abide with thee this coming
night and comfort thee until thy lord return to thee So the
druggists wife abode with her and cheered her with talk throughout the
dark hours and when it was morning Miriam saw her lord enter the
street followed by the Frank and amiddlemost a company of merchants at
which sight her sidemuscles quivered and her colour changed and she
fell ashaking as ship shaketh in midocean for the violence of the
gale When the druggists wife saw this she said to her O my lady
Miriam what aileth thee that I see thy case changed and thy face grown
pale and show disfeatured Replied she By Allah O my lady my heart
forebodeth me of parting and severance of union And she bemoaned
herself with the saddest sighs reciting these couplets

 Incline not to parting I pray  For bitter its savour is aye
 Een the sun at his setting turns pale  To think he must part from the
    day
 And so at his rising for joy  Of reunion hes radiant and gay

Then Miriam wept passing sore wherethan naught could be more making
sure of separation and cried to the druggists wife O my mother said
I not to thee that my lord Nur alDin had been tricked into selling me
I doubt not but he hath sold me this night to yonder Frank albeit I
bade him beware of him but deliberation availeth not against destiny
So the truth of my words is made manifest to thee Whilst they were
talking behold in came Nur alDin and the damsel looked at him and
saw that his colour was changed and that he trembled and there appeared
on his face signs of grief and repentance so she said to him O my
lord Nur alDin meseemeth thou hast sold me Whereupon he wept with
sore weeping and groaned and lamented and recited these couplets

                When eer the Lord gainst any man
                Would fulminate some harsh decree
                And he be wise and skilled to hear
                And used to see
                He stops his ears and blinds his heart
                And from his brain ill judgment tears
                And makes it bald as twere a scalp
                Reft of its hairs
                Until the time when the whole man
                Be pierced by this divine command
                Then He restores him intellect
                To understand

Then Nur alDin began to excuse himself to his handmaid saying By
Allah O my lady Miriam verily runneth the Reed with whatso Allah hath
decreed The folk put a cheat on me to make me sell thee and I fell
into the snare and sold thee Indeed I have sorely failed of my duty to
thee but haply He who decreed our disunion will vouchsafe us reunion
Quoth she I warned thee against this for this it was I dreaded Then
she strained him to her bosom and kissed him between the eyes reciting
these couplets

 Now by your love your love Ill neer forget  Though lost my life
    for stress of pine and fret
 I weep and wail through livelong day and night  As moans the dove on
    sandhilltree beset
 O fairest friends your absence spoils my life  Nor find I
    meetingplace as erst we met

At this juncture behold the Frank came in to them and went up to
Miriam to kiss her hands but she dealt him a buffet with her palm on
the cheek saying Avaunt O accursed Thou hast followed after me
without surcease till thou hast cozened my lord into selling me But O
accursed all shall yet be well Inshallah The Frank laughed at her
speech and wondered at her deed and excused himself to her saying O
my lady Miriam what is my offence Thy lord Nur alDin here sold thee
of his full consent and of his own free will Had he loved thee by the
right of the Messiah he had not transgressed against thee And had he
not fulfilled his desire of thee he had not sold thee Quoth one of
the poets

 Whom I irk let him fly fro me fast and faster  If I name his name I am
    no directer
 Nor the wide wide world is to me so narrow  That I act expecter to this
    rejecter

Now this handmaid was the daughter of the King of France the which is a
wide and spacious city abounding in manufactures and rarities and
trees and flowers and other growths and resembleth the city of
Constantinople and for her going forth of her fathers city there was a
wondrous cause and thereby hangeth a marvellous tale which we will set
out in due order to divert and delight the hearerAnd Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say


       Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Seventyninth Night

She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the cause of
Miriam the Girdlegirl leaving her father and mother was a wondrous and
thereby hangeth a marvellous tale She was reared with her father and
mother in honour and indulgence and learnt rhetoric and penmanship and
arithmetic and cavalarice and all manner crafts such as broidery and
sewing and weaving and girdlemaking and silkcord making and
damascening gold on silver and silver on gold brief all the arts both
of men and women till she became the unionpearl of her time and the
unique gem of her age and day Moreover Allah to whom belong Might and
Majesty had endowed her with such beauty and loveliness and elegance
and perfection of grace that she excelled therein all the folk of her
time and the Kings of the isles sought her in marriage of her sire but
he refused to give her to wife to any of her suitors for that he loved
her with passing love and could not bear to be parted from her a single
hour Moreover he had no other daughter than herself albeit he had
many sons but she was dearer to him than all of them It fortuned one
year that she fell sick of an exceeding sickness and came nigh upon
death wherefore she made a vow that if she recovered from her malady
she would make the pilgrimage to a certain monastery situate in such an
island which was high in repute among the Franks who used to make vows
to it and look for a blessing therefrom When Miriam recovered from her
sickness she wished to accomplish her vow anent the monastery and her
sire despatched her to the convent in a little ship with sundry
daughters of the citynotables to wait upon her and patrician Knights to
protect them all As they drew near the island there came out upon them
a ship of the ships of the Moslems champions of The Faith warring in
Allahs way who boarded the vessel and making prize of all therein
knights and maidens gifts and monies sold their booty in the city of
Kayrawn Miriam herself fell into the hands of a Persian merchant
who was born impotent and for whom no woman had ever discovered her
nakedness so he set her to serve him Presently he fell ill and
sickened well nigh unto death and the sickness abode with him two
months during which she tended him after the goodliest fashion till
Allah made him whole of his malady when he recalled her tenderness and
lovingkindness to him and the persistent zeal with which she had nurst
him and being minded to requite her the good offices she had done him
said to her Ask a boon of me She said O my lord I ask of thee
that thou sell me not but to the man of my choice He answered So be
it I guarantee thee By Allah O Miriam I will not sell thee but to
him of whom thou shalt approve and I put thy sale in thine own hand
And she rejoiced herein with joy exceeding Now the Persian had
expounded to her AlIslam and she became a Moslemah and learnt of him
the rules of worship Furthermore during that period the Persian had
taught her the tenets of The Faith and the observances incumbent upon
her he had made her learn the Koran by heart and master somewhat of the
theological sciences and the traditions of the Prophet after which he
brought her to Alexandriacity and sold her to Nur alDin as we have
before set out Meanwhile when her father the King of France heard
what had befallen his daughter and her company he saw Doomsday break
and sent after her ships full of knights and champions horsemen and
footmen but they fell not in any trace of her whom they sought in the
Islands of the Moslems so all returned to him crying out and
saying Wellaway and Ruin and Well worth the day The King
grieved for her with exceeding grief and sent after her that oneeyed
lameter blind of the left for that he was his chief Wazir a
stubborn tyrant and a froward devil full of craft and guile
bidding him make search for her in all the lands of the Moslems and buy
her though with a shipload of gold So the accursed sought her in all
the islands of the Arabs and all the cities of the Moslems but found no
sign of her till he came to Alexandriacity where he made quest for her
and presently discovered that she was with Nur alDin Ali the Cairene
being directed to the trace of her by the kerchief aforesaid for that
none could have wrought it in such goodly guise but she Then he bribed
the merchants to help him in getting her from Nur alDin and beguiled
her lord into selling her as hath been already related When he had her
in his possession she ceased not to weep and wail so he said to her
O my lady Miriam put away from thee this mourning and grieving and
return with me to the city of thy sire the seat of thy kingship and the
place of thy power and thy home so thou mayst be among thy servants and
attendants and be quit of this abasement and this strangerhood Enough
hath betided me of travail of travel and of disbursing monies on thine
account for thy father bade me buy thee back though with a shipload of
gold and now I have spent nigh a year and a half in seeking thee And
he fell to kissing her hands and feet and humbling himself to her but
the more he kissed and grovelled she only redoubled in wrath against
him and said to him O accursed may Almighty Allah not vouchsafe thee
to win thy wish Presently his pages brought her a shemule with
goldembroidered housings and mounting her thereon raised over her head
a silken canopy with staves of gold and silver and the Franks walked
round about her till they brought her forth the city by the
seagate where they took boat with her and rowing out to a great
ship in harbour embarked therein Then the monocular Wazir cried out to
the sailors saying Up with the mast So they set it up forthright
and spreading the newly bent sails and the colours manned the sweeps and
put out to sea Meanwhile Miriam continued to gaze upon Alexandria till
it disappeared from her eyes when she fell aweeping in her privacy
with sore weepingAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to
say her permitted say


         Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Eightieth Night

She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the
Wazir of the Frankish King put out to sea in the ship bearing Miriam the
Girdlegirl she gazed Alexandriawards till the city was hidden from her
sight when she wailed and wept copious tears and recited these
couplets

 O dwelling of my friends say is there no return  Uswards But what ken
    I of matters Allah made
 Still fare the ships of Severance sailing hastily  And in my wounded
    eyelids tears have taen their stead
 For parting from a friend who was my wish and will  Healed every ill
    and every pain and pang allayd
 Be thou O Allah substitute of me for him  Such charge some day the
    care of Thee shall not evade

Then she could not refrain from weeping and wailing So the
patrician knights came up to her and would have comforted her but
she heeded not their consoling words being distracted by the claims of
passion and lovelonging And she shed tears and moaned and complained
and recited these couplets

 The tongue of Love within my vitals speaketh  Saying This lover boon
    of Love aye seeketh
 And burn my liver hottest coals of passion  And parting on my heart
    sore suffering wreaketh
 How shall I face this fiery love concealing  When fro my wounded lids
    the tear aye leaketh

In this plight Miriam abode during all the voyage no peace was left her
at all nor would patience come at her call Such was her case in company
with the Wazir the monocular the lameter but as regards Nur alDin
the Cairene when the ship had sailed with Miriam the world was
straitened upon him and he had neither peace nor patience He returned
to the lodging where they twain had dwelt and its aspect was black and
gloomy in his sight Then he saw the mtier wherewith she had been
wont to make the zones and her dress that had been upon her beauteous
body so he pressed them to his breast whilst the tears gushed from his
eyes and he recited these couplets

 Say me will Union after parting eer return to be  After longlasting
    torments after hopeless misery
 Alas Alas what wont to be shall never more return  But grant me still
    return of dearest her these eyne may see
 I wonder me will Allah deign our parted lives unite  And will my dear
    ones plighted troth preserve with constancy
 Naught am I save the prey of death since parting parted us  And will
    my friends consent that I a weird so deadly dree
 Alas my sorrow Sorrowing the lover scant avails  Indeed I melt away
    in grief and passions ecstacy
 Past is the time of my delight when were we two conjoined  Would
    Heaven I wot if Destiny mine esperance will degree
 Redouble then O Heart thy pains and O mine eyes oerflow  With
    tears till not a tear remain within these eyne of me
 Again alas for loved ones lost and loss of patience eke  For helpers
    fail me and my griefs are grown beyond decree
 The Lord of Threefold Worlds I pray He deign to me return  My lover and
    we meet as wont in joy and jubilee

Then Nur alDin wept with weeping galore than which naught could be
more and peering into every corner of the room recited these two
couplets

 I view their traces and with pain I pine  And by their sometime home I
    weep and yearn
 And Him I pray who parting deigned decree  Some day He deign vouchsafe
    me their return

Then Nur alDin sprang to his feet and locking the door of the house
fared forth running at speed to the sea shore whence he fixed his eyes
on the place of the ship which had carried off his Miriam whilst sighs
burst from his breast and tears from his lids as he recited these
couplets

 Peace be with you sans you naught compensateth me  The near the far
    two cases only here I see
 I yearn for you at every hour and tide as yearns  For waterplace
    wayfarer plodding wearily

 With you abide my hearing heart and eyensight  And sweeter than the
    honeycomb your memory
 Then O my Grief when fared afar your retinue  And bore that ship away
    my sole expectancy

And Nur alDin wept and wailed bemoaned himself and complained crying
out and saying O Miriam O Miriam Was it but a vision of thee I saw
in sleep or in the allusions of dreams And by reason of that which
grew on him of regrets he recited these couplets

       Mazed with thy love no more I can feign patience
       This heart of mine has held none dear but thee
       And if mine eye hath gazed on others beauty
       Neer be it joyed again with sight of thee
       Ive sworn an oath Ill neer forget to love thee
       And sads this breast that pines to meet with thee
       Thoust made me drink a lovecup full of passion
       Blest time When I may give the draught to thee
       Take with thee this my form whereer thou goest
       And when thourt dead let me be laid near thee
       Call on me in my tomb my bones shall answer
       And sigh responses to a call from thee
       If it were asked What wouldst thou Heaven should order
       His will I answer First and then what pleases thee

As Nur alDin was in this case weeping and crying out O Miriam O
Miriam behold an old man landed from a vessel and coming up to him
saw him shedding tears and heard him reciting these verses

 O Maryam of beauty return for these eyne  Are as densest clouds
    railing drops in line
 Ask amid mankind and my railers shall say  That mine eyelids are
    drowning these eyeballs of mine

Said the old man O my son meseems thou weepest for the damsel who
sailed yesterday with the Frank When Nur alDin heard these words of
the Shaykh he fell down in a swoon and lay for a long while without
life then coming to himself he wept with sore weeping and improvised
these couplets

 Shall we eer be unite after severancetide  And return in the
    perfectest cheer to bide
 In my heart indeed is a lowe of love  And Im pained by the spies who
    my pain deride
 My days I pass in amaze distraught  And her image anights I would see
    by side
 By Allah no hour brings me solace of love  And how can it when
    makebates vex me and chide
 A softsided damsel of slenderest waist  Her arrows of eyne on my heart
    hath plied
 Her form is like Bntree branch in garth  Shame her charms the
    sun who his face most hide
 Did I not fear God be He glorified  My Fair be glorified Had I
    cried

The old man looked at him and noting his beauty and grace and symmetry
and the fluency of his tongue and the seductiveness of his charms had
ruth on him and his heart mourned for his case Now that Shaykh was the
captain of a ship bound to the damsels city and in this ship were a
hundred Moslem merchants men of the Saving Faith so he said to Nur
alDin Have patience and all will yet be well I will bring thee to
her an it be the will of Allah extolled and exalted be HeAnd
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say


       Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Eightyfirst Night

She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the old
skipper said to Nur alDin I will bring thee to her Inshallah the
youth asked When shall we set out and the other said Come but
three days more and we will depart in peace and prosperity Nur alDin
rejoiced at the captains words with joy exceeding and thanked him for
his bounty and benevolence Then he recalled the days of loveliesse
dear and union with his slavegirl without peer and he shed bitter
tears and recited these couplets

 Say will to me and you the Ruthful union show  My lords Shall eer I
    win the wish of me or no
 A visitboon by you will shifty Time vouchsafe  And seize your image
    eyelids which so hungry grow
 With you were Union to be sold I fain would buy  But ah I see such
    grace doth all my means outgo

Then Nur alDin went forthright to the market and bought what he needed
of vitiacum and other necessaries for the voyage and returned to the
Rais who said to him O my son what is that thou hast with thee
said he My provisions and all whereof I have need for the voyage
Thereupon quoth the old man laughing O my son art thou going
apleasuring to Pompeys Pillar Verily between thee and that thou
seekest is two months journey an the wind be fair and the weather
favourable Then he took of him somewhat of money and going to the
bazar bought him a sufficiency of all that he needed for the voyage and
filled him a large earthen jar with fresh water Nur alDin abode
in the ship three days until the merchants had made an end of their
precautions and preparations and embarked when they set sail and
putting out to sea fared on oneandfifty days After this there came
out upon them corsairs pirates who sacked the ship and taking Nur
alDin and all therein prisoners carried them to the city of France and
paraded them before the King who bade cast them into jail Nur alDin
amongst the number As they were being led to prison the galleon
arrived with the Princess Miriam and the oneeyed Wazir and when it
made the harbour the lameter landed and going up to the King gave him
the glad news of his daughters safe return whereupon they beat the
kettledrums for good tidings and decorated the city after the goodliest
fashion Then the King took horse with all his guards and lords and
notables and rode down to the sea to meet her The moment the ship cast
anchor she came ashore and the King saluted her and embraced her and
mounting her on a bloodsteed bore her to the palace where her mother
received her with open arms and asked her of her case and whether she
was a maid as before or whether she had become a woman carnally known by
man She replied O my mother how should a girl who hath been
sold from merchant to merchant in the land of Moslems a slave
commanded abide a virgin The merchant who bought me threatened me with
the bastinado and violenced me and took my maidenhead after which he
sold me to another and he again to a third When the Queen heard these
her words the light in her eyes became night and she repeated her
confession to the King who was chagrined thereat and his affair was
grievous to him So he expounded her case to his Grandees and
Patricians who said to him O King she hath been defiled by the
Moslems and naught will purify her save the striking off of an hundred
Mohammedan heads Whereupon the King sent for the True Believers he had
imprisoned and they decapitated them one after another beginning with
the captain till none was left save Nur alDin They tare off a strip
of his skirt and binding his eyes therewith led him to the rug of blood
and were about to smite his neck when behold an ancient dame came up
to the King at that very moment and said O my lord thou didst vow to
bestow upon each and every church five Moslem captives to help us in
the service thereof so Allah would restore thee thy daughter the
Princess Miriam and now she is restored to thee so do thou fulfil thy
vow The King replied O my mother by the virtue of the Messiah and
the Veritable Faith there remaineth to me of the prisoners but this one
captive whom they are about to put to death so take him with thee to
help in the service of the church till there come to me more prisoners
of the Moslems when I will send thee other four Hadst thou come
earlier before they hewed off the heads of these I had given thee as
many as thou wouldest have The old woman thanked the King for his boon
and wished him continuance of life glory and prosperity Then without
loss of time she went up to Nur alDin whom she raised from the rug of
blood and looking narrowly at him saw a comely youth and a dainty
with a delicate skin and a face like the moon at her full whereupon she
carried him to the church and said to him O my son doff these clothes
which are upon thee for they are fit only for the service of the
Sultan So saying the ancient dame brought him a gown and hood of
black wool and a broad girdle in which she clad and cowled him
and after binding on his belt bade him do the service of the church
Accordingly he served the church seven days at the end of which time
behold the old woman came up to him and said O Moslem don thy silken
dress and take these ten dirhams and go out forthright and divert
thyself abroad this day and tarry not here a single moment lest thou
lose thy life Quoth he What is to do O my mother and quoth she
Know O my son that the Kings daughter the Princess Miriam the
Girdlegirl hath a mind to visit the church this day to seek a
blessing by pilgrimage and to make oblation thereto a douceur of
thankoffering for her deliverance from the land of the Moslems and in
fulfilment of the vows she vowed to the Messiah so he would save her
With her are four hundred damsels not one of whom but is perfect in
beauty and loveliness and all of them are daughters of Wazirs and Emirs
and Grandees they will be here during this very hour and if their eyes
fall on thee in this church they will hew thee in pieces with swords
Thereupon Nur alDin took the ten dirhams from the ancient dame and
donning his own dress went out to the bazar and walked about the city
and took his pleasure therein till he knew its highways and gatesAnd
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say


       Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Eightysecond Night

She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that Nur alDin
after donning his own dress and taking the ten dirhams from the ancient
dame fared forth to the market streets and wandered about a while till
he knew every quarter of the city after which he returned to the
church and saw the Princess Miriam the Girdlegirl daughter of the
King of France come up to the fane attended by four hundred damsels
highbosomed maids like moons amongst whom was the daughter of the
oneeyed Wazir and those of the Emirs and Lords of the realm and she
walked in their midst as she were moon among stars When his eyes fell
upon her Nur alDin could not contain himself but cried out from the
core of his heart O Miriam O Miriam When the damsels heard his
outcry they ran at him with swords shining bright like flashes of
levenlight and would have slain him forthright But the Princess turned
and looking on him knew him with fullest knowledge and said to her
maidens Leave this youth doubtless he is mad for the signs of
madness be manifest on his face When Nur alDin heard this he
uncovered his head and rolled his eyes and made signs with his hands and
twisted his legs foaming the while at the mouth Quoth the Princess
Said I not that the poor youth was mad Bring him to me and stand off
from him that I may hear what he saith for I know the speech of the
Arabs and will look into his case and see if his madness admit of cure
or not So they laid hold of him and brought him to her after which
they withdrew to a distance and she said to him Hast thou come hither
on my account and ventured thy life for my sake and feignest thyself
mad He replied O my lady hast thou not heard the saying of the
poet

 Quoth they Thourt surely raving mad for her thou lovst and I
    There is no pleasantness in life but for the mad reply
 Compare my madness with herself for whom I rave if she Accord
    therewith then blame me not for that which I aby

Miriam replied By Allah O Nur alDin indeed thou hast sinned against
thyself for I warned thee of this before it befel thee yet wouldst
thou not hearken to me but followedst thine own lust albeit that
whereof I gave thee to know I learnt not by means of inspiration nor
physiognomy nor dreams but by eyewitness and very sight for I
saw the oneeyed Wazir and knew that he was not come to Alexandria but
in quest of me Said he O my lady Miriam we seek refuge with Allah
from the error of the intelligent Then his affliction redoubled
on him and he recited this saying

           Pass oer my fault for tis the wise mans wont
           Of others sins to take no harsh account
           And as all crimes have made my breast their site
           So thine all shapes of mercy should unite
           Who from above would mercy seek to know
           Should first be merciful to those below

Then Nur alDin and Princess Miriam ceased not from lovers chiding
which to trace would be tedious relating each to other that which had
befallen them and reciting verses and making moan one to other of the
violence of passion and the pangs of pine and desire whilst the tears
ran down their cheeks like rivers till there was left them no strength
to say a word and so they continued till day departed and night
darkened Now the Princess was clad in a green dress purfled with red
gold and broidered with pearls and gems which enhanced her beauty and
loveliness and inner grace and right well quoth the poet of her

 Like the full moon she shineth in garments all of green With loosened
    vest and collars and flowing hair beseen
 What is thy name I asked her and she replied Im she Who roasts
    the hearts of lovers on coals of love and teen
 I am the pure white silver ay and the gold wherewith The bondmen from
    strait prison and dour releasd been
 Quoth I Im all with rigours consumed but On a rock Said she
    such as my heart is thy plaints are wasted clean
 Even if thy heart I answered be rock in very deed Yet hath God
    caused fair water well from the rock I ween

And when night darkened on them the Lady Miriam went up to her women and
asked them Have ye locked the door and they answered Indeed we
have locked it So she took them and went with them to a place called
the Chapel of the Lady Mary the Virgin Mother of Light because the
Nazarenes hold that there are her heart and soul The girls betook
themselves to prayer for blessings from above and circuited all the
church and when they had made an end of their visitation the Princess
turned to them and said I desire to pass the night alone in the
Virgins chapel and seek a blessing thereof for that yearning after it
hath betided me by reason of my long absence in the land of the
Moslems and as for you when ye have made an end of your visitation do
ye sleep whereso ye will Replied they With love and goodly gree be
it as thou wilt and leaving her alone in the chapel dispersed about
the church and slept The Lady Miriam waited till they were out of sight
and hearing then went in search of Nur alDin whom she found sitting
in a corner on live coals awaiting her He rose and kissed her hands
and feet and she sat down and seated him by her side Then she pulled
off all that was upon her of raiment and ornaments and fine linen and
taking Nur alDin in her arms strained him to her bosom And they ceased
not she and he from kissing and clipping and strumming to the tune of
hocuspocus saying the while How short are the nights of Union
and the nights of Disunion how long are they and reciting these
verses

 O Night of Union Times virginal prize  White star of the Nights with
    auroral dyes
 Thou garrest Dawn after Noon to rise  Say art thou Kohl in Mornings
    Eyes
 Or wast thou Slumber to bleared eye lief
 O Night of Parting how long thy stay  Whose latest hours aye the first
    portray
 This endless circle that noways may  Show breach till the coming of
    Judgmentday
 Day when dies the lover of partinggrief

As they were in this mighty delight and joy engrossing they heard one of
the servants of the Saint smite the gong upon the roof to
call the folk to the rites of their worship and he was even as saith
the poet 

 I saw him strike the gong and asked of him straightway  Who made the
    Fawn at striking gong so knowing eh
 And to my soul What smiting irketh thee the more  Striking the gong
    or striking note of going say

And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her
permitted say


       Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Eightythird Night

She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Nur alDin and
Miriam the Girdlegirl rose forthwith and donned her clothes and
ornaments but this was grievous to Nur alDin and his gladness was
troubled the tears streamed from his eyes and he recited these
couplets

 I ceasd not to kiss that cheek with budding roses dight  And eyes down
    cast and bit the same with most emphatic bite
 Until we were in gloria and lay him down the spy  And sank his
    eyes within his brain declining further sight
 And struck the gongs as they that had the charge of them were like 
    Muezzin crying dutyprayers in Allahs book indite
 Then rose she up right hastily and donned the dress shed doffed  Sore
    fearing lest a shootingstar upon our heads alight
 And cried O wish and will of me O end of all my hopes  Behold the
    morning comes to us in brightest whitest light
 I swear if but one day of rule were given to my life  And I were made
    an Emperor of majesty and might
 Adown Id break the buttresses of churches one and all  And by their
    slaughter rid the earth of every shaveling wight

Then the Lady Miriam pressed him to her bosom and kissed his cheek and
asked him O Nur alDin how long hast thou been in this town Seven
days Hast thou walked about in it and dost thou know its ways and
issues and its seagates and land gates Yes Knowest thou the way
to the offertorychest of the church Yes Since thou knowest
all this as soon as the first third of the coming night is over
go to the offertorychest and take thence what thou wishest and willest
Then open the door that giveth upon the tunnel leading to the sea
and go down to the harbour where thou wilt find a little ship and ten
men therein and when the Rais shall see thee he will put out his hand
to thee Give him thy hand and he will take thee up into the ship and
do thou wait there till I come to thee But ware and have a care lest
sleep overtake thee this night or thou wilt repent whenas repentance
shall avail thee naught Then the Princess farewelled him and going
forth from Nur alDin aroused from sleep her women and the rest of the
damsels with whom she betook herself to the church door and knocked
whereupon the ancient dame opened to her and she went forth and found
the knights and varlets standing without They brought her a dapple
shemule and she mounted whereupon they raised over her head a
canopy with curtains of silk and the knights took hold of the
mules halter Then the guards encompassed her about drawn brand in
hand and fared on with her followed by her till they brought her to
the palace of the King her father Meanwhile Nur alDin abode concealed
behind the curtain under cover of which Miriam and he had passed the
night till it was broad day when the main door was opened and the
church became full of people Then he mingled with the folk and accosted
the old Prioress the guardian of the shrine who said to him
Where didst thou lie last night Said he In the town as thou badest
me Quoth she O my son thou hast done the right thing for hadst
thou nighted in the Church she had slain thee on the foulest wise And
quoth he Praised be Allah who hath delivered me from the evil of this
night Then he busied himself with the service of the church and ceased
not busying till day departed and night with darkness starkened when he
arose and opened the offertorychest and took thence of jewels whatso
was light of weight and weighty of worth Then he tarried till the first
watch of the night was past when he made his way to the postern of the
tunnel and opening it went forth calling on Allah for protection and
ceased not faring on until after finding and opening the door he came
to the sea Here he discovered the vessel moored to the shore near the
gate and her skipper a tall old man of comely aspect with a long
beard standing in the waist his ten men being ranged before him Nur
alDin gave him his hand as Miriam had bidden him and the captain took
it and pulling him on board of the ship cried out to his crew saying
Cast off the moorings and put out to sea with us ere day break Said
one of the ten O my lord the Captain how shall we put out now when
the King hath notified us that tomorrow he will embark in this ship and
go round about the sea being fearful for his daughter Miriam from the
Moslem thieves But the Rais cried out at them saying Woe to you O
accursed Dare ye gainsay me and bandy words with me So saying the old
captain bared his blade and with it dealt the sailor who had spoken a
thrust in the throat that the steel came out gleaming from his nape
and quoth another of the sailors What hath our comrade done of crime
that thou shouldst cut his throat Thereupon the captain clapped hand
to sword and smote off the speakers head nor did he leave smiting the
rest of the sailors till he had slain them all one after other and
cast the ten bodies ashore Then he turned to Nur alDin and cried out
at him with a terrible great cry that made him tremble saying Go
down and pull up the mooringstake Nur alDin feared lest he should
strike him also with the sword so he sprang up and leapt ashore and
pulling up the stake jumped aboard again swiftlier than the dazzling
leven The captain ceased not to bid him do this and do that and tack
and wear hither and thither and look at the stars and Nur alDin did
all that he bade him with heart aquaking for affright whilst he
himself spread the sails and the ship fared with the twain into the
dashing sea swollen with clashing billowsAnd Shahrazad perceived the
dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say


       Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Eightyfourth Night

She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the old
skipper had made sail he drave the ship aided by Nur alDin into the
dashing sea before a favouring gale Meanwhile Nur alDin held on to
the tackle immersed in deep thought and drowned in the sea of
solicitude knowing not what was hidden for him in the future and
whenever he looked at the captain his heart quaked and he knew not
whither the Rais went with him He abode thus preoccupied with care and
doubt till it was high day when he looked at the skipper and saw him
take hold of his long beard and pull at it whereupon it came off in his
hand and Nur alDin examining it saw that it was but a false beard
glued on So he straitly considered that same Rais and behold it was
the Princess Miriam his mistress and the dearling of his heart who had
contrived to waylay the captain and slay him and skinned off his beard
which she had stuck on to her own face At this Nur alDin was
transported for joy and his breast broadened and he marvelled at her
prowess and the stoutness of her heart and said to her Welcome O my
hope and my desire and the end of mine every wish Then love and
gladness agitated him and he made sure of winning to his hopes and his
expectancy wherefore he broke out into song and chanted these
couplets

 To all who unknown my love for the May  From whom Fate disjoins me O
    say I pray
 Ask my kith and kin of my love that aye  Ensweetens my verses to
    lovely lay
         For the loss of the tribesmen my life oer sway
 Their names when named heal all malady  Cure and chase from heart
    every pain I dree
 And my longings for love reach so high degree  That my Sprite is
    maddened each morn I see
         And am grown of the crowd to be saw and say
 No blame in them will I eer espy  No nor aught of solace sans them
    descry
 Your love hath shot me with pine and I  Bear in heart a flame that
    shall never die
         But fire my liver with fiery ray
 All folk my sickness for marvel score  That in darkest night I wake
    evermore
 What ails them to torture this heart forlore  And deem right for loving
    my blood t outpour
         And yethow justly unjust are they

 Would I wot who twas could obtain of you  To wrong a youth whos so
    fain of you
 By my life and by Him who made men of you  And the spy tell aught I
    complain of you
         He lies by Allah in foulest way
 May the Lord my sickness never dispel  Nor ever my heart of its pains
    be well
 What day I regret that in love I fell  Or laud any land but wherein ye
    dwell
         Wring my heart and ye will or make glad and gay
 I have vitals shall ever be true to you  Though racked by the rigours
    not new to you
 Ere this wrong and this right I but sue to you  Do what you will to
    thrall who to you
         Shall neer grudge his life at your feet to lay

When Nur alDin ceased to sing the Princess Miriam marvelled at his
song and thanked him therefor saying Whosos case is thus it behoveth
him to walk the ways of men and never do the deed of curs and cowards
Now she was stout of heart and cunning in the sailing of ships over the
salt sea and she knew all the winds and their shiftings and every
course of the main So Nur alDin said O my lady hadst thou prolonged
this case on me I had surely died for stress of affright and
chagrin more by token of the fire of passion and lovelonging and the
cruel pangs of separation She laughed at his speech and rising without
stay or delay brought out somewhat of food and liquor and they ate and
drank and enjoyed themselves and made merry Then she drew forth rubies
and other gems and precious stones and costly trinkets of gold and
silver and all manner things of price light of weight and weighty of
worth which she had taken from the palace of her sire and his
treasuries and displayed them to Nur alDin who rejoiced therein with
joy exceeding All this while the wind blew fair for them and merrily
sailed the ship nor ceased sailing till they drew near the city of
Alexandria and sighted its landmarks old and new and Pompeys Pillar
When they made the port Nur alDin landed forthright and securing the
ship to one of the FullingStones took somewhat of the treasures
that Miriam had brought with her and said to her O my lady tarry in
the ship against I return and carry thee up into the city in such way
as I should wish and will Quoth she It behoveth that this be done
quickly for tardiness in affairs engendereth repentance Quoth he
There is no tardiness in me and leaving her in the ship went up
into the city to the house of the druggist his fathers old friend to
borrow of his wife for Miriam veil and mantilla and walking boots and
petticoattrousers after the usage of the women of Alexandria unknowing
that there was appointed to betide him of the shifts of Time the Father
of Wonders that which was far beyond his reckoning Thus it befel Nur
alDin and Miriam the Girdlegirl but as regards her sire the King of
France when he arose in the morning he missed his daughter and
questioned her women and her eunuchs of her Answered they O our lord
she went out last night to go to Church and after that we have no
tidings of her But as the King talked with them behold there arose
so great a clamour of cries below the palace that the place rang
thereto and he said What may be the news The folk replied O King
we have found ten men slain on the seashore and the royal yacht is
missing Moreover we saw the postern of the Church which giveth upon
the tunnel leading to the sea wide open and the Moslem prisoner who
served in the Church is missing Quoth the King An my ship be lost
without doubt or disputeAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased saying her permitted say


       Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Eightyfifth Night

She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the King
of France missed his daughter they brought him tidings of her saying
Thy yacht is lost and he replied An the craft be lost without
dispute or doubt my daughter is in it So he summoned without stay or
delay the Captain of the Port and cried out at him saying By the
virtue of the Messiah and the Faith which is no liar except thou and
thy fighting men overtake my ship forthright and bring it back to me
with those who are therein I will do thee die the foulest of deaths and
make a terrible example of thee Thereupon the captain went out from
before him trembling and betook himself to the ancient dame of the
Church to whom said he Heardest thou aught from the captive that was
with thee anent his native land and what countryman he was And
she answered He used to say I come from the town of Alexandria When
the captain heard the old womans words he returned forthright to the
port and cried out to the sailors Make ready and set sail So they
did his bidding and straightway putting out to sea fared night and day
till they sighted the city of Alexandria at the very time when Nur
alDin landed leaving the Princess in the ship They soon espied the
royal yacht and knew her so they moored their own vessel at a distance
therefrom and putting off in a little frigate they had with them which
drew but two cubits of water and in which were an hundred fightingmen
amongst them the oneeyed Wazir for that he was a stubborn tyrant and a
froward devil and a wily thief none could avail against his craft as
he were Abu Mohammed alBattl they ceased not rowing till they
reached the bark and boarding her all at once found none therein save
the Princess Miriam So they took her and the ship and returning to
their own vessel after they had landed and waited a long while
set sail forthright for the land of the Franks having accomplished
their errand without a fight or even drawing sword The wind blew fair
for them and they sailed on without ceasing and with all diligence
till they reached the city of France and landing with the Princess
Miriam carried her to her father who received her seated on the throne
of his Kingship As soon as he saw her he said to her Woe to thee O
traitress What ailed thee to leave the faith of thy fathers and
forefathers and the safeguard of the Messiah on whom is our reliance
and follow after the faith of the Vagrants to wit the faith of
AlIslam the which arose with the sword against the Cross and the
Images Replied Miriam I am not at fault I went out by night to the
church to visit the Lady Mary and seek a blessing of her when there
fell upon me unawares a band of Moslem robbers who gagged me and bound
me fast and carrying me on board the barque set sail with me for their
own country However I beguiled them and talked with them of their
religion till they loosed my bonds and ere I knew it thy men overtook
me and delivered me And by the virtue of the Messiah and the Faith
which is no liar and the Cross and the Crucified thereon I rejoiced
with joy exceeding in my release from them and my bosom broadened and I
was glad for my deliverance from the bondage of the Moslems Rejoined
the King Thou liest O whore O adultress By the virtue of that which
is revealed of prohibition and permission in the manifest Evangel
I will assuredly do thee die by the foulest of deaths and make thee the
vilest of examples Did it not suffice thee to do as thou didst the
first time and put off thy lies upon us but thou must return upon us
with thy deceitful inventions Thereupon the King bade kill her and
crucify her over the palace gate but at that moment the oneeyed
Wazir who had long been enamoured of the Princess came in to him and
said Ho King slay her not but give her to me to wife and I will
watch over her with the utmost warding nor will I go in unto her till
I have built her a palace of solid stone exceeding high of foundation
so no thieves may avail to climb up to its terraceroof and when I have
made an end of building it I will sacrifice thirty Moslems before the
gate thereof as an expiatory offering to the Messiah for myself and for
her The King granted his request and bade the priests and monks and
patriarchs marry the Princess to him so they did his bidding whereupon
he bade set about building a strong and lofty palace befitting her rank
and the workmen fell to work upon it On this wise it betided the
Princess Miriam and her sire and the oneeyed Wazir but as regards Nur
alDin when he came back with the petticoattrousers and mantilla and
walking boots and all the attire of Alexandrian women which he had
borrowed of the druggists wife he found the air void and the fane
afarAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say
her permitted say


       Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Eightysixth Night

She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Nur
alDin found the air void and the fane afar his heart sank
within him and he wept floods of tears and recited these verses

 The phantom of Soada came by night to wake me towards morning while my
    companions were sleeping in the desert
 But when we awoke to behold the nightly phantom I saw the air vacant
    and the place of visitation distant

Then Nur alDin walked on along the seashore and turned right and left
till he saw folk gathered together on the beach and heard them say O
Moslems there remaineth no honour to Alexandriacity since the Franks
enter it and snatch away those who are therein and return to their own
land at their leisure nor pursued of any of the Moslems or
fighters for the Faith Quoth Nur alDin to them What is to do and
quoth they O my son one of the ships of the Franks full of armed
men came down but now upon the port and carried off a ship which was
moored here with her that was therein and made unmolested for their
own land Nur alDin fell down aswoon on hearing these words and
when he recovered they questioned him of his case and he told them all
that had befallen him first and last whereupon they all took to
reviling him and railing at him saying Why couldst thou not bring her
up into the town without mantilla and muffler And all and each of the
folk gave him some grievous word berating him with sharp speech and
shooting at him some shaft of reproach albeit one said Let him be
that which hath befallen him sufficeth him till he again fell down in
a faintingfit And behold at this moment up came the old druggist
who seeing the folk gathered together drew near to learn what was the
matter and found Nur alDin lying aswoon in their midst So he sat down
at his head and arousing him said to him as soon as he recovered O my
son what is this case in which I see thee Nur alDin said O uncle
I had brought back in a barque my lost slavegirl from her fathers
city suffering patiently all I suffered of perils and hardships and
when I came with her to this port I made the vessel fast to the shore
and leaving her therein repaired to thy dwelling and took of thy
consort what was needful for her that I might bring her up into the
town but the Franks came and capturing barque and damsel made off
unhindered and returned to their own land Now when the Shaykh the
druggist heard this the light in his eyes became night and he grieved
with sore grieving for Nur alDin and said to him O my son why didst
thou not bring her out of the ship into the city without mantilla But
speech availeth not at this season so rise O my son and come up with
me to the city haply Allah will vouchsafe thee a girl fairer than she
who shall console thee for her Alhamdolillahpraised be Allahwho hath
not made thee lose aught by her Nay thou hast gained by her And
bethink thee O my son that Union and Disunion are in the hands of the
Most High King Replied Nur alDin By Allah O uncle I can never be
consoled for her loss nor will I ever leave seeking her though on her
account I drink the cup of death Rejoined the druggist O my son and
what art thou minded to do Quoth Nur alDin I am minded to return to
the land of the Franks and enter the city of France and emperil
myself there come what may loss of life or gain of life Quoth the
druggist O my son there is an old sawNot always doth the crock
escape the shock and if they did thee no hurt the first time belike
they will slay thee this time more by token that they know thee now
with full knowledge Quoth Nur alDin O my uncle let me set out and
be slain for the love of her straightway and not die of despair for her
loss by slow torments Now as Fate determined there was then a ship in
port ready to sail for its passengers had made an end of their
affairs and the sailors had pulled up the mooringstakes when Nur
alDin embarked in her So they shook out their canvas and relying on
the Compassionate put out to sea and sailed many days with fair wind
and weather till behold they fell in with certain of the Frank
cruisers which were scouring those waters and seizing upon all ships
they saw in their fear for the Kings daughter from the Moslem
corsairs and as often as they made prize of a Moslem ship they carried
all her people to the King of France who put them to death in
fulfilment of the vow he had vowed on account of his daughter Miriam
So seeing the ship wherein was Nur alDin they boarded her and taking
him and the rest of the company prisoners to the number of an hundred
Moslems carried them to the King and set them between his hands He
bade cut their throats Accordingly they slaughtered them all forthwith
one after another till there was none left but Nur alDin whom the
headsman had left to the last in pity of his tender age and slender
shape When the King saw him he knew him right well and said to him
Art thou not Nur alDin who was with us before Said he I was never
with thee and my name is not Nur alDin but Ibrahim Rejoined the
King Thou liest thou art Nur alDin he whom I gave to the ancient
dame the Prioress to help her in the service of the church But Nur
alDin replied O my lord my name is Ibrahim Quoth the King Wait a
while and bade his knights fetch the old woman forthright saying
When she cometh and seeth thee she will know an thou be Nur alDin or
not At this juncture behold in came the oneeyed Wazir who had
married the Princess and kissing the earth before the King said to him
Know O King that the palace is finished and thou knowest now I vowed
to the Messiah that when I had made an end of building it I would cut
thirty Moslems throats before its doors wherefore I am come to take
them of thee that I may sacrifice them and so fulfil my vow to the
Messiah They shall be at my charge by way of loan and whenas there
come prisoners to my hands I will give thee other thirty in lieu of
them Replied the King By the virtue of the Messiah and the Faith
which is no liar I have but this one captive left And he pointed to
Nur alDin saying Take him and slaughter him at this very moment and
the rest I will send thee when there come to my hands other prisoners
of the Moslems Thereupon the oneeyed Wazir arose and took Nur alDin
and carried him to his palace thinking to slaughter him on the
threshold of the gate but the painters said to him O my lord we have
two days painting yet to do so bear with us and delay to cut the
throat of this captive till we have made an end of our work haply by
that time the rest of the thirty will come so thou mayst despatch them
all at one bout and accomplish thy vow in a single day Thereupon the
Wazir bade imprison Nur alDinAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day
and ceased saying her permitted say


      Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Eightyseventh Night

She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the Wazir
bade imprison Nur alDin they carried him to the stables and left him
there in chains hungering and thirsting and making moan for himself
for indeed he saw death face to face Now it fortuned by the ordinance
of Destiny and foreordained Fate that the King had two stallions own
brothers such as the Chosroe Kings might sigh in vain to possess
themselves of one of them they were called Sbik and Lhik and one
of them was pure silvern white while the other was black as the darksome
night And all the Kings of the isles had said Whoso stealeth us one
of these stallions we will give him all he seeketh of red gold and
pearls and gems but none could avail to steal them Now one of them
fell sick of a jaundice and there came a whiteness over his eyes
whereupon the King gathered together all the farriers in the city to
treat him but they all failed of his cure Presently the Wazir came
into the King and finding him troubled because of the horse thought to
do away his concern and said to him O King give me the stallion and I
will cure him The King consented and caused carry the horse to the
stable wherein Nur alDin lay chained but when he missed his brother
he cried out with an exceeding great cry and neighed so that he
affrighted all the folk The Wazir seeing that he did thus but because
he was parted from his brother went to tell the King who said If
this which is but a beast cannot brook to be parted from his brother
how should it be with those that have reason And he bade his grooms
take the other horse and put him with his brother in the Wazirs
stables saying Tell the Minister that the two stallions be a gift
from me to him for the sake of my daughter Miriam Nur alDin was
lying in the stable chained and shackled when they brought in the two
stallions and he saw that one of them had a film over his eyes Now he
had some knowledge of horses and of the doctoring of their diseases so
he said to himself This by Allah is my opportunity I will go to the
Wazir and lie to him saying I will heal thee this horse then will I
do with him somewhat that shall destroy his eyes and he will slay me
and I shall be at rest from this woefull life So he waited till the
Wazir entered the stable to look upon the steed and said to him O my
lord what will be my due an I heal this horse and make his eyes whole
again Replied the Wazir As my head liveth an thou cure him I will
spare thy life and give thee leave to crave a boon of me And Nur
alDin said O my lord bid my hands be unbound So the Wazir bade
unbind him and he rose and taking virgin glass brayed it and mixed
it with unslaked lime and a menstruum of onionjuice Then he applied
the whole to the horses eyes and bound them up saying in himself Now
will his eyes be put out and they will slay me and I shall be at rest
from this woefull life Then he passed the night with a heart free
from the uncertainty of cark and care humbling himself to Allah
the Most High and saying O Lord in Thy knowledge is that which
dispenseth with asking and craving Now when the morning morrowed and
the sun shone the Wazir came to the stable and loosing the bandage
from the horses eyes considered them and found them finer than before
by the ordinance of the King who openeth evermore So he said to Nur
alDin O Moslem never in the world saw I the like of thee for the
excellence of thy knowledge By the virtue of the Messiah and the Faith
which is no liar thou makest me with wonder to admire for all the
farriers of our land have failed to heal this horse Then he went up to
Nur alDin and doing off his shackles with his own hand clad him in a
costly dress and made him his master of the Horse and he appointed him
stipends and allowances and lodged him in a story over the stables So
Nur alDin abode awhile eating and drinking and making merry and
bidding and forbidding those who tended the horses and whoso neglected
or failed to fodder those tied up in the stable wherein was his service
he would throw down and beat with grievous beating and lay him by the
legs in bilboes of iron Furthermore he used every day to descend and
visit the stallions and rub them down with his own hand by reason of
that which he knew of their value in the Wazirs eyes and his love for
them wherefore the Minister rejoiced in him with joy exceeding and his
breast broadened and he was right glad unknowing what was to be the
issue of his case Now in the new palace which the oneeyed Wazir had
bought for the Princess Miriam was a latticewindow overlooking his old
house and the flat wherein Nur alDin lodged The Wazir had a daughter
a virgin of extreme loveliness as she were a fleeing gazelle or a
bending branchlet and it chanced that she sat one day at the lattice
aforesaid and behold she heard Nur alDin singing and solacing himself
under his sorrows by improvising these verses

 O my Censor who wakest amorn to see  The joys of life and its jubilee
 Had the fangs of Destiny bitten thee  In such bitter case thou hadst
    pled this plea
                   Ah me for Love and his case ah me
                   My heart is burnt by the fires I dree
 But from Fates despight thou art safe this day  From her falsest fay
    and her crying Nay
 Yet blame him not whom his woes waylay  Who distraught shall say in his
    agony
                   Ah me for Love and his case ah me
                   My heart is burnt by the fires I dree
 Excuse such lovers in flight abhorrd  Nor to Loves distresses thine
    aid afford
 Lest thy self be bound by same binding cord  And drink of Loves
    bitterest injury
                   Ah me for Love and his case ah me
                   My heart is burnt by the fires I dree
 In His service I wont as the days went by  With freest heart through
    the nights to lie
 Nor tasted wake nor of Love aught reckt  Ere my heart to subjection
    summoned he
                   Ah me for Love and his case ah me
                   My heart is burnt by the fires I dree
 None weet of Love and his humbling wrong  Save those he sickened so
    sore so long
 Who have lost their wits mid the loverthrong  Draining bitterest cup
    by his hard decree
                   Ah me for Love and his case ah me
                   My heart is burnt by the fires I dree
 How oft in Nights gloom he cause wake to rue  Lovers eyne and from
    eyelids their sleep withdrew
 Till tears to the railing of torrents grew  Overflowing cheeks
    unconfined and free
                   Ah me for Love and his case ah me
                   My heart is burnt by the fires I dree
 How many a man he has joyed to steep  In pain and for pine hath he
    plundered sleep
 Made don garb of mourning the deepest deep  And even his dreaming
    forced to flee
                   Ah me for Love and his case ah me
                   My heart is burnt by the fires I dree
 How oft sufferance fails me How bones are wasted  And down my cheeks
    torrent teardrops hasted

 And embittered She all the food I tasted  However sweet it was wont to
    be
                   Ah me for Love and his case ah me
                   My heart is burnt by the fires I dree
 Most hapless of men who like me must love  And must watch when Night
    droops her wing from above
 Who Swimming the main where affection drove  Must sigh and sink in
    that gloomy sea
                   Ah me for Love and his case ah me
                   My heart is burnt by the fires I dree
 Who is he to whom Love eer stinted spite  And who scaped his springes
    and easy sleight
 Who free from Love lived in lifes delight  Where is he can boast of
    such liberty
                   Ah me for Love and his case ah me
                   My heart is burnt by the fires I dree
 Deign Lord such suffering wight maintain  Then best Protector protect
    him deign
 Establish him and his life assain  And defend him from all calamity
                   Ah me for Love and his case ah me
                   My heart is burnt by the fires I dree

And when Nur alDin ended his say and ceased to sing his rhyming lay
the Wazirs daughter said to herself By the virtue of the Messiah and
the Faith which is no liar verily this Moslem is a handsome youth But
doubtless he is a lover separated from his mistress Would Heaven I wot
an the beloved of this fair one is fair like unto him and if she pine
for him as he for her An she be seemly as he is it behoveth him to
pour forth tears and make moan of passion but an she be other than
fair his days are wasted in vain regrets and he is denied the taste of
delightsAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say
her permitted say


       Now when it was the Eight Hundred and Eightyeighth Night

She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Wazirs
daughter said to herself An his beloved be fair as he it behoveth him
to pour forth tears and if other than fair his heart is wasted in
vain regrets Now Miriam the Girdlegirl the Ministers consort had
removed to the new palace the day before and the Wazirs daughter knew
that she was straitened of breast so she was minded to seek her and
talk with her and tell her the tidings of the young man and the rhymes
and verses she had heard him recite but before she could carry out her
design the Princess sent for her to cheer her with her converse So she
went to her and found her heavy at heart and her tears hurrying down her
cheeks and whilst she was weeping with sore weeping she recited these
couplets

 My life is gone but lovelongings remain  And my breast is straitened
    with pine and pain
 And my heart for parting to melt is fain  Yet hoping that union will
    come again
                     And join us in one who now are twain
 Stint your blame to him who in hearts your thrall  With the wasted
    frame which his sorrows gall
 Nor with aim of arrow his heart appal  For parted lover is saddest of
    all
                     And Loves cup of bitters is sweet to drain

Quoth the Wazirs daughter to her What aileth thee O Princess to be
thus straitened in breast and sorrowful of thought Whereupon Miriam
recalled the greatness of the delights that were past and recited these
two couplets

 I will bear in patience estrangement of friend  And on cheeks rail
    tears that like torrents wend
 Haply Allah will solace my sorrow for He  Neath the ribs of unease
    maketh ease at end

Said the Wazirs daughter O Princess let not thy breast be
straitened but come with me straightway to the lattice for there is
with us in the stable a comely young man slender of shape and
sweet of speech and meseemeth he is a parted lover Miriam asked And
by what sign knowest thou that he is a parted lover and she answered
O Queen I know it by his improvising odes and verses all watches of
the night and tides of the day Quoth the Princess in herself If what
the Wazirs daughter says be true these are assuredly the traits of the
baffled the wretched Ali Nur alDin Would I knew if indeed he be the
youth of whom she speaketh At this thought lovelonging and
distraction of passion redoubled on her and she rose at once and walking
with the maiden to the lattice looked down upon the stables where she
saw her love and lord Nur alDin and fixing her eyes steadfastly upon
him knew him with the bestest knowledge of love albeit he was sick of
the greatness of his affection for her and of the fire of passion and
the anguish of separation and yearning and distraction Sore upon him
was emaciation and he was improvising and saying

 My heart is a thrall my tears neer abate  And their rains the railing
    of clouds amate
 Twixt my weeping and watching and wanting love  And whining and
    pining for dearest mate
 Ah my burning heat my desire my lowe  For the plagues that torture
    my heart are eight
 And five upon five are in suite of them  So stand and listen to all I
    state
 Memry madding thoughts moaning languishment  Stress of longing
    love plight disconsolate
 In travail affliction and strangerhood  And annoy and joy when on her
    I wait
 Fail me patience and stay for engrossing care  And sorrows my suffering
    soul regrate
 On my heart the possession of passion grows  O who ask of what fire in
    my hearts create
 Why my tears in vitals should kindle flame  Burning heart with ardours
    insatiate
 Know Im drowned in Deluge of tears and my soul  From Lazlowe
    fares to Hwiyahgoal

When the Princess Miriam beheld Nur alDin and heard his loquence and
verse and speech she made certain that it was indeed her lord Nur
alDin but she concealed her case from the Wazirs daughter and said to
her By the virtue of the Messiah and the Faith which is no liar I
thought not thou knewest of my sadness Then she arose forthright and
withdrawing from the window returned to her own place whilst the
Wazirs daughter went to her own occupations The Princess awaited
patiently awhile then returned to the window and sat there gazing upon
her beloved Nur alDin and delighting her eyes with his beauty and inner
and outer grace And indeed she saw that he was like unto moon at full
on fourteenth night but he was ever sighing with tears never drying
for that he recalled whatso he had been abying So he recited these
couplets

 I hope for Union with my love which I may neer obtain  At all but
    bitterness of life is all the gain I gain
 My tears are likest to the main for ebb and flow of tide  But when I
    meet the blamerwight to staunch my tears Im fain
 Woe to the wretch who garred us part by spelling of his spells 
    Could I but hend his tongue in hand Id cut his tongue in twain
 Yet will I never blame the days for whatso deed they did  Mingling with
    merest purest gall the cup they made me drain
 To whom shall I address myself and whom but you shall seek  A heart
    left hostage in your Court by you a captive taen
 Who shall avenge my wrongs on you tyrant despotical  Whose
    tyranny but grows the more the more I dare complain
 I made him regnant of my soul that he the reign assain  But me he
    wasted wasting too the soul I gave to reign
 Ho thou the Fawn whom I so lief erst gathered to my breast  Enow of
    severance tasted I to own its might and main
 Thourt he whose favours joined in one all beauties known to man  Yet
    I thereon have wasted all my Patience fair domain
 I entertained him in my heart whereto he brought unrest  But I am
    satisfied that I such guest could entertain
 My tears for ever flow and flood likest the surging sea  And would I
    wot the track to take that I thereto attain
 Yet sore I fear that I shall die in depths of my chagrin  And must
    despair for evermore to win the wish Id win

When Miriam heard the verses of Nur alDin the lovinghearted the
parted they kindled in her vitals a fire of desire and whilst her
eyes ran over with tears she recited these two couplets

 I longed for him I love but when we met  I was amazed nor tongue nor
    eyes I found
 I had got ready volumes of reproach  But when we met could syllable
    no sound

When Nur alDin heard the voice of Princess Miriam he knew it and wept
bitter tears saying By Allah this is the chanting of the Lady
MiriamAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her
permitted say

NOTE p There is something wondrous nave in a lover who when
asked by his mistress to sing a song in her honour breaks out into
versical praises of her parts But even the classical Arab authors did
not disdain such themes See in AlHarr Ass of Mayyfarikn where
Ab Zayd laments the impotency of old age in form of a Rasy or funeral
oration Preston p  and Chenery p  It completely deceived Sir
William Jones who inserted it into the chapter De Poesi Funebri p
 Poeseos Asiatic Commentarii gravely noting Hc Elegia non
admodum dissimilis esse videtur pulcherrimi illius carminis de Sauli et
Jonathani obitu at que ade versus iste ubi provocant adversarios
nunquam rediit a pugn contentione sine spiculo sanguine imbuto ex
Hebro reddi videtur

             A sanguine occisorum a fortium virorum adipe
             Arcus Jonathani non rediit irritus

I need hardly say with Captain Lockett  that this Sabb warrior
this Arabian Achilles is the celebrated Bonus Deus or Hellespontiacus of
the Ancients The oration runs thus

         O folk I have a wondrous tale so rare
         Much shall it profit hearers wise and ware
         I saw in saladyears a potent Brave
         And sharp of edge and point his warrior glaive
         Who entered joust and list with hardiment
         Fearless of risk of victory confident
         His vigorous onset straitest places oped
         And easy passage through all narrows groped
         He neer encountered foe in single fight
         But came from tilt with spear in blood stained bright
         Nor stormed a fortress howso strong and stark
         With fencd gates defended deep and dark
         When shown his flag without th auspicious cry
         Aidance from Allah and fair victory nigh
         Thuswise full many a night his part he played
         In strength and youthtides stately garb arrayed
         Dealing to fair young girl delicious joy
         And no less welcome to the blooming boy
         But Time neer ceased to stint his wondrous strength
         Steadfast and upright as the gallows length
         Until the Nights oerthrew him by their might
         And friends contemned him for a feckless wight
         Nor was a wizard but who wasted skill
         Over his case nor leach could heal his ill
         Then he abandoned arms abandoned him
         Who gave and took salutes so fierce and grim
         And now lies prostrate drooping haughty crest
         For who lives longest him most ills molest
         Then see him here he lies on bier for bed
         Who will a shroud bestow on stranger dead

A fair measure of the difference between Eastern and Western manners is
afforded by such a theme being treated by their gravest writers and the
verses being read and heard by the gravest and most worshipful men
whilst amongst us Preston and Chenery do not dare even to translate
them The latter indeed had all that immodest modesty for which
English professional society is notable in this xixth century He
spoiled by needlessly excluding from a scientific publication Mem
RAS all of my Proverbia Communia Syriaca See Unexplored Syria i
 and every item which had a shade of double entendre But Nemesis
frequently found him out during his short and obscure rule in Printing
House Square The Thunderer was distinguished by two of the foulest
indecencies that ever appeared in an English paper

  They will ask thee concerning wine and casting of lots sayIn both
  are great sin and great advantages to mankind but the sin of them
  both is greater than their advantage See Koran ii  Mohammed
  seems to have made up his mind about drinking by slow degrees and the
  Koranic law is by no means so strict as the Mullahs have made it The
  prohibitions revealed at widely different periods and varying in
  import and distinction have been discussed by AlBayzwi in his
  commentary on the above chapter He says that the first revelation was
  in chapt xvi  but as the passage was disregarded Omar and others
  consulted the Apostle who replied to them in chapt ii  Then as
  this also was unnoticed came the final decision in chapt v 
  making wine and lots the work of Satan Yet excuses are never wanting
  to the Moslem he can drink Champagne and Cognac both unknown in
  Mohammeds day and he can use wine and spirits medicinally like
  sundry of ourselves who turn up the nose of contempt at the idea of
  drinking for pleasure

Footnote 

  Miriam Arabic Maryam is a Christian name in Moslem lands Ab
  Maryam Marys father says Motarrazi on AlHariri Ass of
  Alexandria is a term of contempt for men are called after sons
  eg Abu Zayd not after daughters In more modern authors Abu
  Maryam is the name of ushers and lesser officials in the Kazis court

Footnote 

  This formality so contrary to our Western familiarity after
  possession is an especial sign of good breeding amongst Arabs and
  indeed all Eastern nations It reminds us of the grand manner in
  Europe two hundred years ago not a trace of which now remains

Footnote 

  These lines are in Night i ordered somewhat differently so I quote
  Torrens p 

Footnote 

  ie to the return SalmAnd with thee be peace and the mercy of
  Allah and His blessings See vol ii  The enslaved Princess had
  recognised her fathers Wazir and knew that he could have but one
  object which being a man of wit and her lord a raw laddie he was
  sure to win

Footnote 

  It is quite in Moslem manners for the bystanders to force the sale
  seeing a silly lad reject a most advantageous offer for sentimental
  reasons And the owner of the article would be bound by their consent

Footnote 

  Arab Wallahi Bi is the original particle of swearing a Harf
  aljarr governing the genitive as Billhi and suggesting the idea
  of adhesion Wa noting union is its substitute in oathformul and
  Ta takes the place of Wa as Tallhi The threefold forms are
  combined in a great swear

Footnote 

  ie of divorcing their own wives

Footnote 

  These lines have occurred before I quote Mr Payne

Footnote

  Carolus Magnus then held court in Paris but the text evidently
  alludes to one of the portcities of Provence as Marseille which we
  English will miscall Marseilles

Footnote 

  Here the writer not the young wife speaks but as a taleteller he
  says hearer not reader

Footnote 

  Kayrawn the Arab form of the Greek Cyrene which has lately been
  opened to travellers and has now lost the mystery which enshrouded it
  In Hafiz and the Persian poets it is the embodiment of remoteness and
  secrecy as we till the last quarter century spoke of the deserts of
  Central Africa

Footnote 

  Arab Innn alluding to all forms of impotence from dislike
  natural deficiency or fascination the favourite excuse Easterns
  seldom attribute it to the true cause weak action of the heart but
  the Romans knew the truth when they described one of its symptoms as
  cold feet Clinopedalis ad venerem invalidus ab ea antiqua
  opinione frigiditatem pedum concubituris admodum officere Hence St
  Francis and the barefooted Friars See Glossarium Eroticum Lingu
  Latin Parisiis DondeyDupr MDCCCXXVI

Footnote 

  I have noted the use of island for land in general So in the
  European languages of the sixteenth century insula was used for
  peninsula eg Insula de Cori  the Corean peninsula

Footnote 

  As has been noticed vol i  the monocular is famed for mischief
  and men expect the mischief to come from his blinded eye

Footnote 

  Here again we have a specimen of inverted speech vol ii 
  abusive epithets intended for a high compliment signifying that the
  man was a tyrant over rebels and a froward devil to the foe

Footnote 

  Arab Bab alBahr see vol iii 

Footnote 

  Arab Batrikah see vol ii  The Templars Knights of Malta and
  other orders half ecclesiastic half military suggested the application
  of the term

Footnote 

  These lines have occurred in vol i I quote Torrens p 

Footnote 

  Maryam alHusn containing a double entendre O place of the white doe
  Rm of beauty The girls name was Maryam the Arab form of Mary
  also applied to the BV by Eastern Christians Hence a common name of
  Syrian women is Husn Maryam  one endowed with the spiritual
  beauties of Mary vol iv  I do not think that the name was
  manufactured by the Arab storytellers after the pattern of their own
  names eg Nur alDin or Noureddin light of the faith Tajeddin
  crown of faith etc for the use of their imaginary Christian female
  characters

Footnote 

  I may here remind readers that the Bn which some Orientalists will
  write Ben is a straight and graceful species of Moringa with
  plentiful and intensely green foliage

Footnote 

  Arab Amd alSawri  the Pillar of Masts which is still the local
  name of Diocletians column absurdly named by Europeans Pompeys
  Pillar

Footnote

Footnote 

  Arab Ghurb which Europeans turn to Grab

Footnote 

  Arab Sayyib Thayyib a rare word it mostly applies to a woman who

Footnote 

  Arab Batrikah here meaning knights leaders of armed men as in

Footnote 

  ie for the service of a temporal monarch

  thence applied like Kiyfah to physiognomy One Kri was the first

Footnote 

  Reported to be a Hadis or saying of Mohammed to whom are attributed
  many such shrewd aphorisms eg Allah defend us from the ire of
  the mild tempered

Footnote 

  These lines are in vol i  I quote Torrens p 

Footnote 

  These lines have occurred before I quote Mr Payne

Footnote 

  Arab Khkbk an onomatopia like our flipflap and a host of
  similar words This profaning a Christian Church which contained the
  relics of the Virgin would hugely delight the coffeehouse habitus
  and the Egyptians would be equally flattered to hear that the son of a
  Cairene merchant had made the conquest of a Frankish Princess Royal
  That he was an arrant poltroon mattered very little as his cowardice
  only set off his charms

Footnote 

  ie after the rising up of the dead

Footnote 

  Arab Nafsah the precious one ie the Virgin

Footnote 

  Arab Nks a wooden gong used by Eastern Christians which were
  wisely forbidden by the early Moslems

Footnote 

  ie a graceful slender youth

Footnote 

  There is a complicated pun in this line made by splitting the word
  after the fashion of punsters Zarbu lNawks  the striking of
  the gongs and Zarbu l Naw Ks  striking the departure signal
  decide thou fem addressed to the Nafs soul or self I have
  attempted a feeble imitation

Footnote

  Arab Kayyimah the fem of Kayyim misprinted Kayim in vol ii
  

Footnote 

  ie hadst thou not disclosed thyself He has one great merit in a
  coward of not being ashamed for his cowardice and this is a
  characteristic of the modern Egyptian whose proverb is He ran
  away Allah shame him is better than He was slain Allah bless
  him

Footnote 

  Arab Ahjar alKassrn nor forgotten In those days ships anchored
  in the Eastern port of Alexandria which is now wholly abandoned on
  account of the rocky bottom and the dangerous Levanter which as the
  Gibraltar proverb says

                         Makes the stones canter

Footnote 

  Arab Hakk  rights a word much and variously used To express the
  possessive mine a Badawi says Hakki pron Haggi and Ll a
  Syrian Sht for Shayyati my little thing or tabai my dependent
  an Egyptian Biti my portion and a Maghribi Mti and diyyli
  di allaz l  this that is to me Thus mine becomes a shibboleth

  ie Hoping to catch Nur alDin

Footnote 

  Arab Sawwhn  the Wanderers Pilgrims wandering Arabs whose
  religion AlIslam so styled by its Christian opponents And yet the
  new creed was at once accepted by whole regions of Christians and
  Mauritania which had rejected Roman paganism and Gothic Christianity
  This was eg Syria and the socalled Holy Land not because as
  is fondly asserted by Christians AlIslam was forced upon them by the
  sword but on account of its fulfilling a need its supplying a higher
  belief unity as opposed to plurality and its preaching a more manly
  attitude of mind and a more sensible rule of conduct Arabic still
  preserves a host of words special to the Christian creed and many of
  them have been adopted by Moslems but with changes of signification

Footnote 

  ie of things commanded and things prohibited The writer is
  thinking of the Koran in which there are not a few abrogated
  injunctions

Footnote 

  See below for the allusion

Footnote 

  Arab Kafr  desert place It occurs in this couplet

                Wa Kabrun Harbin fmaknin Kafrin
                Wa laysa Kurba Kabri Harbin Kabrun
            Harbs corse is quartered in coarse wold accurst
            Nor close to corse of Harb is other corse

  words made purposely harsh because uttered by a Jinni who killed a
  traveller named Harb So Homer

Footnote

Footnote 

  The topothesia is here designedly made absurd Alexandria was one of
  the first cities taken by the Moslems AH    and the
  Christian pirates preferred attacking weaker places Rosetta and
  Damietta

Footnote 

  Arab Bild alRm here and elsewhere applied to France

  Known to us as the web and pin it is a film which affects Arab
  horses in the damp hot regions of Malabar and Zanzibar and soon blinds
  them This equine cataract combined with loindisease compels men to
  ride Pegu and other ponies

Footnote 

  Arab Zujj bikr whose apparent meaning would be glass in the lump
  and unworked Zaj j bears however the meaning of clovenails the
  ripe bud of the cloveshrub and may possibly apply to one of the
  manifold Alfz Adwiyah names of drugs Here however pounded
  glass would be all sufficient to blind a horse it is much used in the
  East especially for dogs affected by intestinal vermicules

Footnote 

  Alluding to the Arab saying The two rests Alrhatni certainty
  of success or failure as opposed to Wisws when the mind
  fluctuates in doubt

Footnote 

  She falls in love with the groom thus anticipating the noble
  selfdevotion of Miss Aurora Floyd

Footnote

Footnote 

  The use of masculine for feminine has frequently been noted I have
  rarely changed the gender or the number the plural being often
  employed for the singular vol i  Such change may avoid
  mystification and confusion but this is the very purpose of the
  substitution which must be preserved if local colour is to be
  respected

Footnote 

  The wellknown Koranic verse whereby Allah is introduced into an
  indecent tale and Holy Writ is punned upon I have noticed iii
   that victory Fath lit  opening everything as eg a
  maidenhead
