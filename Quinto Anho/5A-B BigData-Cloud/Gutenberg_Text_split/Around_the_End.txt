AROUND THE END




CHAPTER I

THE FIRST SCRIMMAGE


This way everyone

Coach Payson sent the call to each end of the field and then swinging
his small blue megaphone in his hand waited for the panting players
to gather about him in front of the bench They came running in from
all parts of the gridiron a motley gathering of football aspirants
seasoned veterans of last years Yardley Varsity Second Team
men substitutes new boys big little fat thin all sizes and
conditions Andy Ryan the little redhaired trainer stood over his
pile of blankets and his water pail back of the sideline and viewed
the sixtyodd candidates with a pessimistic shake of his head John
Payson turning at the moment saw it and smiled

Whats the matter Andy Dont they look good he asked

Ive seen some funny bunches in my day replied the trainer but
never anything like them

Thats what you say every year scoffed Payson goodnaturedly
I guess this lot will average about the same He turned to the
breathless fellows gathering about him and pulled a little red book
from his pocket All right now First scrimmage today fellows
First squad Cousins Plant Fales Girard Merriwell Stark Metz
Holmes Greene Fayette Marion Second squad Fox Steger Keene
Johnson McKesson Fenwick Adler Simms Crandall Burtis Brinspool
First squad take the south goal and kick off to the second Men not
playing get into blankets On the run now Well have two tenminute
periods Get a couple of fellows to take the chains will you Andy

The two teams trotted to their positions Andy tossed a horn to Davis
the manager and summoned two blueblanketed figures from the bench to
act as linesmen and in a moment the ball was hurtling from Merriwells
toe

Behind the benches scattered over the grand stand a hundred or more
watchers who during the preliminary practice had lolled comfortably
on the sunny seats sat up and gave their attention to the scrimmage
Simms gathered in the long kick and behind a quicklyformed
interference ran the ball back a good twenty yards before the first
squad smothered him Murmurs of applause arose from the audience

That was a dandy run wasnt it observed Harry Merrow who seated
beside Gerald Pennimore halfway up the stand was eating peanuts as
though his life depended on it Gerald nodded

I wonder why Payson put Simms on the second and Holmes on the first
he said Holmes only got into the Broadwood game last year for a few
minutes at the end

He played all through the Nordham game though didnt he I think
hes every bit as good as Simms

Hes just as good a player maybe Harry but he isnt half the general
Al is I see Burtis is playing right half on the second I wonder if he
will make the team this year Of course he will get into the games now
and then if only to kick goals but I guess hes got a lot of football
to learn yet

Gee they ought to make him a present of his position on the First
Team responded Harry flicking a peanut shell at a group of boys
below Any fellow who will go into a Broadwood game without any
experience and win for us by a goal from the field ought to have
anything he wants

Well I guess Payson will take him on all right I hope so I like
Burtis Do you know him

I met him once in your room last Spring It was the day of the
baseball game with Broadwood He seemed a quiet sort of chap

Yes hes a bit shy at first Gerald chuckled and then in response
to his friends look of inquiry continued Ill never forget the
night last year he came into our room and told Dan quite seriously that
he would like to play on the football team please Harold Towne put
him up to it Burtis was a pretty green lad then

Towne always was a pup remarked Harry cheerfully There he goes
now

Who Towne

Burtis hes got the ball Made a peach of a catch and Oh good
work Burtis Gee Gerald he must have made fifteen easily Say
he can run with the ball cant he Did you see him slip away from
Fayette

Yes I wouldnt be surprised if he made good this year Goodness knows
we need a couple of halfbacks Were going to miss Tom Roeder and
Stearns and Hammel like anything

Were going to miss a whole lot of fellows Well never have an end
as good as Dan Vinton nor a guard like Ridge Did you hear Payson say
at the meeting the other night that only once before since hes been
coaching have we had so few veterans to build the team around

Yes So too I guess Simms and Merriwell are really the only members
of last years team we have Holmes was more of a secondstring man
than anything else Still theres good material out there Marion for
full Stark for tackle two good quarters Fayette and Crandall and
Greene for halfs well get along I guess

I wonder what sort of a captain Merriwell will make mused Harry
Hes a good player but

And a good fellow and well liked dont you think I dont believe
hes the leader that Dan was though

I should say not You must miss Dan a whole lot Gerald

Its something fierce Lonelys no name for it I had a letter from
him yesterday Hes out for the Yale Freshman Team of course

I dare say theyll make him captain asserted Harry loyally

But Gerald shook his head Not much chance of that I guess They
made Alf Loring captain last year and it isnt likely theyd give
the captaincy to Yardley fellows two years running Firsts going to
score Harry Whos playing center for them Girard Hes a whopping
big brute isnt he Pshaw Hed better learn to pass back better than
that Blocked Ball you idiots Whos got it First I think No
second Who Burtis It does look like him butno itsIt is
Burtis for a fact How the dickens did he manage to get around that
end If he doesnt watch out Payson will have him on the First Team

Then hes not likely to watch out laughed Harry Times up

They watched the players return to the bench and don their blankets
while Andy ladled out the water sparingly Payson studied his
memorandum book talking the while with Percy Davis the manager
Captain Merriwell trailing his blanket behind him joined them Then
the coach turned to the line of players

All right Plant Girard Stark Marion Steger Johnson McKesson
Fenwick and Brinspool he called Once around the field on the trot
and run in And dont forget to weigh

Nine blankets were tossed aside and the released players started
their jog around the sidelines Mr Payson filled their places in
the lineup and a few minutes later the second half of the scrimmage
began Up on the stand Harry Merrow having finished the last of the
peanuts blew up the bag and demolished it with a loud report that made
the audience jump in their seats When his amusement had subsided he
turned to Gerald again

I wish Id gone in for football he sighed

Youre too light you silly chump replied Gerald Besides you
cant do crosscountry work and play football Thats what kept me out
of football that and the fact that Dan wouldnt let me on

When are we going to start work asked Harry

In about two weeks Andy wants the weather to get a bit colder Where
did you finish last year Eighth wasnt it

Ninth Holder beat me out at the line We ought to have an easy time
with Broadwood this year Gerald Most of their best men last year were
seniors

I hope not I dont want any runaway race Theres no fun in that
Look seconds going to try a goal from field There goes Burtis back
I hope he makes it

Where is it About the twenty yards He ought to make it if they
dont get through on him There it goes Over wasnt it

I think so but it was pretty far to the left Yes its a goal That
chaps playing half the game for the second squad today Ill bet
theyll have him in the first tomorrow

Ill bet they wont

Why

Because tomorrows Sunday replied Harry with a chuckle Gerald
pulled Harrys cap over his face rumpled his hair and ran an elbow
into his ribs

Youre a smart little joker arent you he laughed Sit up and
watch the kickoff and behave yourself or as Ned Tooker used to say
hebave yourself

He was a silly ass said Harry smoothing his hair and adjusting his
cap

Ned Dont you believe it Harry He was a dandy Ned was Ill bet he
has a better time than any other three fellows I know Thats a punk
kickoff Fenwicks got it Go it you slowpoke Theyve got him He
ran the wrong way the chump Funny how easy it is to play the game
from the grand stand Harry

Yes I guess you and I would do some brilliant little stunts if we had
to go out there agreed Harry nodding his head toward the field
If I had the ball and one of those big chaps like Girard came at me
Id drop it like a hot potato and never stop running until I was in
 Whitson with the door locked behind me Oh Id be a brave little
football player

Every man to his trade laughed Gerald Your tradeand mineis
running Harry

Thats so Then I guess Id get to my room ahead of Girard wouldnt
I Hello times up Lets get back Im getting gooseflesh all over
me It certainly gets cold when the sun quits business Did you have a
good time this summer

Dandy Dad and I went across for two months England France
Switzerland Holland Germany and a little bit of Italy It was great

It must have been sighed Harry Wish my father owned all the
steamship lines in the world I spent the summer down on the Jersey
coast with the mosquitoes Had a good time though Used to get into
my bathing suit at eleven and keep it on until most dinner time You
ought to see my back Its likelike mahogany

Your face is bad enough I didnt know you that day you yelled to me
from the window Thought you were a colored gentleman

They made their way down the stand and on to the field Ahead of them
the players their blankets flapping grotesquely behind them were
racing up the path toward the gymnasium Two or three however still
lingered where coach manager and trainer were in consultation As
Gerald and Harry reached the end of the field one of these passed them
at a trot turned to look and stopped

Hello Pennimore he said I guess you remember me dont you

Of course I do Burtis Glad to see you again How are you They
shook hands You know Merrow

Ithink so We met last year didnt we asked Kendall Burtis as he
shook hands again Harry said yes and Gerald asked

Are you in Clarke again this year Burtis

Yes same place Im alone so far My roommate Towne hasnt shown up
yet

That so Whats the matter with him asked Gerald as they went on

I dont know I asked at the Office the other day and the secretary
there said they were expecting him

It would be a terrible loss to the school if he didnt come back
observed Gerald gravely Kendall shot a glance at him and smiled

Hope he stays away said Harry You played some football today
Burtis

Much obliged I had pretty good luck

Luck didnt kick that goal did it laughed Gerald

Well theres always a lot of luck in trying for goal replied
Kendall seriously Sometimes just when youre getting the ball away
something happens like a forward breaking through and you get sort of
rattled Then theres the pass too If that doesnt come right youre
likely to miss Theres a lot of luck in it Well I must be getting
on Glad to have seen you again Pennimore You too Merrow

Thanks What are you doing this evening Burtis Mind if I drop in for
a minute

I wish you would I havent anything to do IIll look for you He
nodded and trotted ahead

Funny about him mused Harry Hes as homely as a mudfence until he
smiles and then blessed if he isnt almost goodlooking What do you
know about that old Gerald




CHAPTER II

THE RABBIT AND THE DUKE


Harry Merrows remark was quite true true in what it said and in what
it implied When he smiled Kendall Burtis was a different looking
chap entirely but he didnt often smile and when he didnt it was
no exaggeration to call him homely He was sixteen years of age of
average height with a figure that seemed to have more than the usual
allowance of corners He had the rugged appearance of a boy who has
lived out of doors and worked there too He had ashybrown hair dark
gray eyes a nose which was almost a pug and a broad mouth Add plenty
of brown freckles to a face well tanned and you have a fair idea of
Kendalls physiognomy But the mouth was kindly the nose suggested a
sense of humor and the gray eyes were clear and honest and somehow
in spite of its homeliness the face was attractive

He sat at the table in  Clarke Hall after supper that evening with
his books open before him and a lead pencil protruding from a corner
of his mouth And as he conned his lesson muttering to himself at
times the pencil wobbled about ludicrously The room was on the second
floor and at the back of the building It was plainly furnished and had
a somewhat threadbare look What few pictures adorned the walls were
mostly on one side of the room the side sacred to the roommate who had
not yet returned

There was a knock on the door and in response to Kendalls invitation
Gerald Pennimore entered You know you said I might call Burtis he
announced but if youre busy

Im not Pennimore I was just having a go at Latin Sit down wont
you And Kendall arose and pushed forward a chair with eager shyness
This is Harolds I dont own anything as comfortable

Gerald seated himself in the Morris chair and looked about him He was
a decided contrast to his host Rather tall slim and lithe with a
graceful carriage and easy manners fairhaired blueeyed eager and
alert he was quite different from the almost delicate youngster who
had entered Yardley Hall School three years before Today in his
senior year he was Class President captain of the CrossCountry Team
a valuable member of the Track Team a hockey player of some ability
and a power in the school In age he was a year older than Kendall

Towne hasnt shown up yet he asked

Not yet They say at the Office that he is expected but I have a
notion he isnt coming back

Youll be heartbroken about it of course said Gerald
sympathetically But there was a smile in his blue eyes

Kendall looked across gravely Well I got sort of used to him he
answered Maybe theyd put some other fellow in I wouldnt get along
with as well I suppose you miss Vinton a good deal Pennimore He was
an awfully fine chap wasnt he

Yes Yes I miss him a lot You see we were together three years
here in school and we spent some of our vacations together too Ive
traveled with older fellows ever since I came here and now theyre
about all gone I suppose its a mistake not to pick your friends from
your own class but I couldnt very well help myself I had rather
a hard time of it when I first struck this place Gerald smiled
reminiscently You see Burtis I was handicapped by having a father
so wealthy that everyone knew about him Then too Ive lived in the
summer right here within a mile of the school So when I came a lot
of the fellows were down on me They used to call me Miss Nancy and
Moneybags and things like that and I was pretty miserable for
a while If it hadnt been for Dan and two or three other fellows
fellows like Alf Loring and Tom Dyer Id have given it up I guess
Well Im glad I didnt How are the football prospects this year
Burtis Are we going to do the usual thing to Broadwood

I dont know much about them I hear that weve only got two or three
firststring men left from last year though

Yes but weve got a lot of good subs and fellows from last years
Second I suppose youre fairly certain of a place Burtis

I dont know replied Kendall slowly I havent had much experience
you see

Experience Great Scott you had experience enough to go in in the
last minute and land a goal from the fortyyard line

That wasnt hard You see Fogg made a fine pass and Simms aimed the
ball just right and all I had to do was kick it

Yes with the whole crazy Broadwood team charging through on you
like a lot of madmen Sure it was dead easyI dont think Gerald
laughed I saw you today too Burtis and all Ive got to say is
that if you can kick as well as you did last year and run as well as
you did today theyll have an awfully hard time keeping you off the
First Team Of course Im not a football playernever had time for it
except with a scrub team one yearbut you cant live with a fellow who
has football on the brain for three years without getting the critical
eye And Im going to tell you something that Dan said last Spring
Maybe I oughtnt to but I guess youre not the sort to get a swelled
head Dan said That fellow Burtis is a born football player and if
he had got started earlier hed have most of us looking like amateurs
Theyll make him captain before he gets through see if they dont

Kendall colored with pleasure and embarrassment Thatsthats
awfully kind of Vinton he murmured butbut I guess he was
mistaken

Yes he was always making mistakes about football things replied
Gerald dryly Dan is stupid like a fox Anyway I hope hes right
Burtis

Thank you Maybe if I had gone to a school where they played football
before I came here Id know more about it Therestheres a lot to
learn you see

Youll learn it affirmed Gerald heartily Well youve got studying
to do and I guess a little of it wont hurt me any so Ill run along
Hold on though I very nearly forgot what I came for I applied for
a room in Dudley last Spring you know I guess that Seniors have the
privilege of rooming there if they want to and I got my roomNumber
 I was to share it with a fellow named Kirk

George Kirk Captain of the Golf Team I know him

Thats the fellow Ive nothing against Kirk rather like him in
fact what I know of him which isnt very much but afterwards I sort
of hated the idea of giving up my old room here and when I got back
the other day and saw it I hiked around to the Office and begged Mr
Forisher to let me keep it He kicked a lot but finally said I might
Seems he had a couple of fellows down for it and had to switch them
somewhere else So as it is Im alone in  Now what I was going to
suggest was thiswhyhello

Gerald stopped and listened In the hall above there was a slamming of
doors and a scurry of feet Theyd better cut that before they get
downstairs or Collins will nab them The clamor increased Through the
partly open door they could hear someone taking the stairs at bounds
while above there was the clamor as of a pursuing mob The quarry
whoever he was reached the bottom of the flight with a final jump
and then in a twinkling the room door crashed wide open and a tall
lank youth plunged in He was out of breath and the smile he summoned
was too agitated to seem genuine

Say let me hide here a minute will you he whispered to Gerald
hoarsely

Gerald motioned to the further bed Slide under there he said
quietly The boy flew around the table dropped to the floor and
squirmed quickly from sight Gerald stepped to the door to close it
but the pursuit was already at the bottom of the stairs laughing and
calling Gerald left the door ajar scurried back to his chair and
thrusting his hands into his pockets leaned carelessly back

Illustration The boy dropped to the floor and squirmed quickly from
sight

Yes when it came to doing it Burtis I just couldnt give up the old
place You get terribly fond of a room after

There was a hurried knock and the door was pushed open revealing a
halfdozen laughing faces beyond

Hello Pennimore Is he in here The spokesman was a big fellow named
Johnson a Second Class boy who roomed on the floor above

Hello returned Gerald with a display of mild curiosity Is who
here

The Rabbit CottonTail Didnt he slide in here Johnson looked
suspiciously around

Of course he did cried another of the crowd He didnt go
downstairs and this is the only door thats open Where is he
Pennimore Weve got to have him We need him in our business

I dont know the gentleman replied Gerald with a smile

Well hes in here just the same declared Johnson

Oh sure Ive got him in my pocket

Hes in a closet whispered another fellow audibly

Under a bed probably growled a third Say whose room is this
anyway

This room belongs to my friend Mr Burtis returned Gerald amiably
If you ask him nicely he will probably allow you to come in and search
it to your hearts content Mind if this committee of thugs looks
around Burtis

Nno I suppose not answered Kendall But I dont see why they
should

I dont see any reason myself agreed Gerald carefully avoiding a
glance toward the further bed Johnson on the whole I guess youd
better run away And you might close the door after you

Then he isnt here asked Johnson doubtfully

Who isnt here demanded Gerald with a fine show of irritability
Cant you see he isnt here Who the dickens do you want anyhow

Maybe he did sneak downstairs after all someone suggested Well
get him when he comes back fellows

All right said Johnson Abject apologies for disturbing you
Pennimore but the law must be enforced you know

Oh certainly replied Gerald carelessly Go as far as you like but
close the door after you

The door closed and the footfalls died away up the stairs After a
minute

Come out Mr Rabbit said Gerald softly The hounds have gone

There was a scuffling under Kendalls bed and feet first the quarry
emerged Much obliged he panted Are you sure theyve gone

Mm fairly sure Ill lock the door anyhow Sit down and recover your
savoir faire whatever that is You must be a newcomer Mr Rabbit I
dont recall your features

Yes II came last week replied the other seating himself on the
foot of the bed and brushing the dust from his clothes He had eyes
that for want of a better word might be called hazel and the rims
were inflamed Gerald decided however that the redness was not from
too much poring over textbooks for the youth didnt look like that
sort He was lanky ungainly and none too attractive His mouth was
unpleasant and his face didnt look quite clean And the redrimmed
eyes had a sly look in them very unlike a rabbits In age he seemed
about seventeen

May I ask continued Gerald why the gentlemen were so eager to
discover you

The boys eyes shifted and dropped Theythey were hazing me he
muttered

Hazing you Oh surely not Hazing isnt indulged in here
Mistererwhat did you say the name was Rabbit

My names Cotton I dont care what you call it but they were trying
to make me hold my head in a basin of water

In a basin of water What an odd thing to do Why Mr Cotton

They saidCotton gulped angrilythey said they wanted to see if I
was absorbent

Absorbent Oh I see absorbent cotton Gerald laughed and even
Kendall had to smile a little Well were you

I got away from them he growled

Oh well that wouldnt have hurt you any you know In factand
Gerald smiled slightlyin fact a little water might be beneficial
Cotton

Cotton scowled Well they neednt think they can do that sort of
thing to me Im too old a bird Ive been to school before And if
they try any more of their funny stunts someone will get hurt

I dont like your attitude said Gerald coldly A little fun doesnt
hurt anyone and as youre a newcomer Cotton you must expect a
certain amount of ragging I think youll find the coast clear now

Besides went on Cotton aggrievedly disdaining the hint they
wanted to put ink in the water

You should have reminded them that you were not blottingpaper merely
absorbent cotton replied Gerald with a smile

There was a knock on the door and Gerald looked inquiringly at Kendall
Cotton slipped to the floor prepared to again seek the refuge of the
bed

Who is there asked Kendall

Wellington May I come in a moment

Its all right I guess said Gerald Its The Duke He arose and
unlocked the door and the newcomer slipped in He had a round merry
face above which a tousled head of redbrown hair glinted in the light
like copper He was about Geralds age but heavier rounder softer
He grinned at Gerald as he closed the door softly behind him and then
observed the other two boys

Troubles over Cotton he announced The enemy is dispersed Keep
quiet and you can make it all right Lock the door if you want to
Better start along though before they get together again

Cotton moved doubtfully toward the door Theyd better not touch me
he threatened or

Son said The Duke sternly you take my advice and dont make any
foolish remarks I dont care much whether they drown you in a basin
Rather wish they would Beat it Cotton

And Cotton beat it only pausing long enough to cast a scowl at The
Duke

The latter watched him go and when the door was closed behind him
turned with a comical look of despair to Gerald

Say honest Gerald what would you do if you had a thing like that
wished on you

You dont mean hes rooming with you exclaimed Gerald

Tis true O Solomon My chum got away from me this year and thats
what I drew When I first saw it I thought to myself its no use
Duke you cant do it Its too much Send in your resignation and
pack your little handbag But then I got to thinking that if I didnt
suffer someone else would have to and my selfsacrificing nature
prevailed So thats how Say you might introduce me to your friend
if you think he can stand it Gerald

I beg pardon I thought you fellows knew each other Burtis this is
The Duke of Wellington Duke this is Mr Kendall Burtis

Ah he of the nimble toe Im glad to know you Burtis I saw you kick
that goal last Fall I need not say that I am one of your humble but
sincere admirers

Kendall smiled shyly as they shook hands

Where does this Cotton chap come from asked Gerald as they seated
themselves again Somehow hehe doesnt quite look as though he
belonged Duke

He comes from some place in Maryland my Maryland Hes been at
school somewhere down there I think Anyhow hes always comparing
Yardley with his last place to the detriment of Yardley Thats what
started the trouble tonight Lin Johnson and Billy Richards and two
or three others happened in and in about twenty seconds Cotton was
telling us what was wrong with the school I dont know where this
other place hes been at is located but to hear him talk about it
youd think it was just outside of Paradise Well the fellows stood
it for a while looking sort of pained and surprised you know and
then Lin got started and began to josh him He doesnt take a joke very
well and sooh I dont know but pretty soon they decided theyd
find out whether he was absorbent cotton or just plain batting And so
they tried to get him to put his head in a bowl of water Of course
I couldnt interfere with the pleasure of my guests and of course
I couldnt take a hand at ragging my roommate so I was forced to
maintain a difficult neutrality I rather wished theyd drown him but
he got away and bolted down the hall His name by the way is Charles
Charles Cotton

That sounds familiar mused Gerald

Youre thinking of the chap who helped Izaak Walton write his
Compleat Angler but I dont think this is the same Im not sure
though he looks a good deal like a fish The worst I can say about
him fellows is that he has an apparently insurmountable hatred of
water when applied to the outer person I hope however to overcome
his aversion Each evening I recite to him that charming little poem

    Water cold water For washing and drinking
      Theres nothing like water cold water Im thinking

And The Duke having arisen to deliver the poetical gem bowed deeply
and vanished through the doorway

What did you say his name is asked Kendall The Duke of Wellington

His name laughed the other is Lester Wellington but hes been
known as The Duke of Wellington ever since he came here The Duke is
a good sort but hes horribly lazy about study Hes been here five
years I believe and has just got into the Second Class Everyone
likes him though and hes as kindhearted as can be Its a shame he
doesnt do better with his studies Id hate to be in his place and
have that Mr Rabbit rooming with me Gerald shuddered I dont know
why I should take such an aversion to the chap but Well lets
forget him What I started to say half an hour ago Burtis was this

dubiouslytheres no telling what might happen to me

each alone Anyway well see Goodnight Burtis Sorry youve had so
much interruption All my fault I fear See you tomorrow




CHAPTER III

COTTON TRIES FOOTBALL


Kendall emerged from the doorway of Whitson Hall and stood for a
minute at the top of the flight of worn granite steps It was a warm
lazy day in the last week of September a day that promised to become
even warmer and lazier as it progressed Just now the time was only a
little after halfpast eight and breakfast was just over The first
recitation hour was at nine and in front of the buildings fellows were
loitering in the sunlight Here on the steps of Whitson at least a
dozen were holding forth Girard who played center on the football
team Jensen another pigskin follower Davis the manager who was
somewhat handicapped with the given name of Percival which had been
mercifully shortened and amended to Perky Perry Whitehall the
dignified editorinchief of the school weekly The Scholiast and
others whom Kendall knew only by sight Many looked up as he came out
and nodded or spoke to him Doubtless any one of the three or four
groups sitting or standing about the steps would have been pleased had
he joined them for Kendall had been a school hero in a small way ever
since when nearly a year ago now he had won the Broadwood game by a
kick from placement in the last two minutes of play But Kendall was
still rather shy still very modest in his estimate of his own merits
and would rather have taken a licking than intrude where he wasnt
wanted

He had been rooming with Gerald Pennimore in  Clarke for four days
now and was still wondering about it Why Gerald who was perhaps the
richest boy in schoolthere was a Fourth Class fellow named Hodgkins
who had just entered and whose father a railway magnate was popularly
credited with the possession of more wealth than Mr John T Pennimore
the Steamship Kingwhy Gerald wealthy and popular had selected him
who was anything but wealthy and whose circle of friends included
possibly not more than a dozen or so for a roommate was a puzzle
The only likely explanation Kendall decided was that Gerald had
done it out of pure kindness of heart Whatever the reason however
Kendall was intensely grateful It was fine to have such a fellow
as Gerald Pennimore for a friend fine to share such a comfortable
even luxurious room as Number  fine to get away from his former
roommate Harold Towne a chap with whom anyone with less patience and
good nature than Kendall could never have put up

But there was something else that Kendall was yet more grateful for
and as he stood there at the top of the steps and let his gaze wander
over the scene before him he realized it anew He was very grateful
to his father who by more than one sacrifice had found the money
for Kendalls second year at Yardley There had been a time during
the summer when the boys chances of returning to school had looked
pretty slim It had been a bad summer for potatoes and up in Aroostook
County Maine where the Burtis farm was a failure of the potato crop
spelled trouble It had been not until almost a fortnight before the
commencement of the Fall Term that Kendall had been quite certain of
returning to Yardley and he very well knew that back home more than
one comfort would be dispensed with the coming Winter that he might
keep on with his education And he had made up his mind that none of
the money spent on him should be wasted He meant to study hard and
learn all he could this year for it might be his last He had resolved
to win a scholarship if hard work would do it There was the Gordon
Scholarship which rebated the entire tuition fee or failing that
there remained four Sidney Scholarships of eighty dollars One of the
five Kendall meant to win

From where he stood Long Island Sound blue and still stretched east
and west visible over the tops of the trees which ran for nearly a
halfmile between the school grounds and the shore The buildings
circled about the edge of a plateau down which a wellkept roadway
dropped to the meadow lands below and wound westward to the little
village of Wissining to the river beyond and finally to the small
city of Greenburg beyond that The river flowed down from behind the
school property a placid tidal stream which in fair weather was
usually alive with boats and canoes There were six school buildings
four of them Clarke Whitson Dudley and Merle dormitories one of
them Oxford given over to recitation rooms library assembly hall
the Office the Principals living quarters and the rooms of the
two school societies Cambridge and Oxford Beyond Merle Hall the
dormitory for the Preparatory Class boys was the Kingdon Gymnasium
completing the line Between the gymnasium and the river lay the
athletic grounds Here were the tennis courts the baseball and
football fields the hockey rink in winter the quartermile cinder
track and the boathouse and floats The golf links began nearby and
wandered away along the curving stream uphill and down

Yardley Hall School is so well known that it is perhaps unnecessary
for me to bore you with description Therefore a few more words and
I am done The schools enrollment is about two hundred and seventy
students There are five classes First Second Third Fourth and
Preparatory The faculty numbers twelve ranging from the Principal
Dr Tobias Hewitt known as Toby down to Mrs Ponder the matron
affectionatelyand surreptitiouslycalled Emily

Kendall descended the steps and turned to his left At the first
entrance of Clarke Hall he entered and climbed two flights of wellworn
stairs bore to his left again and opened the door of the last room on
the front of the building Number  was a big square welllighted
room Beside the shallow bay windows in front there was a window on the
side from which past the obtruding shoulder of Whitson one caught a
brief view of Wissining and the mouth of the river in the distance and
of The Prospect in the foreground Each side of the room held a bed a
washstand and a bureau A big broad study table held the center and
was flanked by easy chairs There were many pictures photographs
and trophies on the walls the carpet was cheerful in tones of brown
and gold and the windowseat was piled high with manyhued cushions
Altogether the room looked homelike and cheerful and while there
were numerous evidences of wealth from the silverbacked brushes and
toilet articles on Geralds chiffonier to the heavy softpiled carpet
underfoot there was no ostentation

Gerald halfburied in the cushions of the windowseat was having
a last look at Wilhelm Tell before going into class A German
dictionary was lying beside him on the sill of the open window and a
frown was playing about his brow He looked up when Kendall came in and
slammed the volume of Schiller shut with a sigh of relief

Its criminal Kendall to have to translate German on a day like
this You cant do justice to it It needs a thick fog to gargle
with No one can manage a good German pronunciation on a fair day
no one that is but a German Gerald gathered the books together
and sat up Thanks be Im not a German Think of going through life
having to call an insurance policy aawait a minute He opened the
dictionary and fluttered the leaves quickly Ha Having to call it
a versicherungsschein Wouldnt that bewell niederschlagend
Wouldnt it

Worse than that laughed Kendall It would be grimmig

Grimmig Gerald frowned a moment Thats furious isnt it

Yes or fierce

Oh I wonder if the Germans can talk slang I bet they cant Any
nation that calls an irregular verb an unregelmssig Zeitwort must be
far too deficient in humor to produce any George Ades What time is it

Kendall glanced at a small traveling clock on Geralds chiffonier and
informed him that it was twelve minutes to nine Gerald sighed again

Im off to the sacrifice then he murmured By the way dont make
any engagement for tomorrow please I want you to have dinner with me
at the house Afterwards if it doesnt rainGerald looked anxiously
at the bank of haze along the horizonwell kick along shore in the
launch See you later

As the door closed Kendall picking up his Cicero smiled It wasnt
very likely that he would have had an engagement on Sunday Then
the smile faded and he wondered as he went out what sort of an
appearance he would make at Sound View He had been there once before
but there had been several others with him and the occasion had been
most informal Sunday dinner he reflected ruefully was a different
proposition Perhaps however his blue serge suit purchased in
Greenburg last Spring and pretty well worn since would do if it
were well brushed As he reached the stairs The Duke clattered down
the flight above and overtook him The Duke was radiant in a suit
of intensely blue flannel the coat of which cut extremely low and
secured with two buttons allowed a generous view of a vividly pink
shirt The Duke was bareheaded and his coppery hair showed evidences
of having been recently wet and brushed

Hello Burtis he greeted ranging himself alongside Ive got grand
news for you

Kendall looked politely curious

Yes sir stupendous news Mr Charles Cotton is going out for
the football team The Duke chuckled Can you imagine it Picture
the doughty Charles hurling himself fiercely against thethe craven
foe his eyes lighted with the joy of battle and the ball clasped
desperately to his heaving chest Get it What He told me of his
decision this morning his epochmarking decision Epochmarking is
some language what Ive been simply bursting with the news ever
since but youre the first fellow Ive told My word but Ill bet
Payson will be pleased He looked at Kendall and grinned Simply
lays you flat doesnt it Cant express yourself at all what I
knew youd be overcome I congratulated Charles with tears in my
voice Burtis I said to him Charles my boy this is indeed a happy
moment for the old school I thank you I thank you on behalf of my
schoolmates Charles on behalf of the team on behalf of the coach and
the captain And I thank you on my own behalf Charles for you have
brought joy to my sad heart light to my weary eyes and laughter to my
lips Yes sir I said all that And do you think he was pleased Not
a bit of it He turned upon me likelike a viper and called mewell
I think Id better not tell you what he called me It was distinctly in
bad taste

Kendall laughed and The Duke encouraged rattled on Now the question
is whether wed better divulge the news all at once or sort of prepare
folks for it I tell you its going to make an awful difference to
the team having Cotton on it With his noble example before you you
fellows cant help but go in and win I hope Broadwood wont hear about
it If she did shed probably disband her team tomorrow

Has he ever played before asked Kendall as they joined the throng
crowding its way into Oxford

No never I believe I think he offered his services last year
wherever he was but they were not accepted He lays the fact to
jealousy Isnt it sad such things can be Where are you headed Latin
Me too And that reminds me that I forgot to do my composition Wont
Collins be pleased

If the Assistant Principal was pleased he didnt allow the fact to
become evident for he said several dryly sarcastic things to The Duke
and ended by suggesting to him that he deliver the Latin composition to
him at his room not later than six oclock that evening Whereupon The
Duke cheerful and forgiving promised to accept the suggestion and the
Orations of Marcus Tullius Cicero engaged the attention of the class

As it was Saturday football practice began at three oclock instead
of four Kendall joined the stream of candidates that flowed from the
gymnasium locker room to the field and wondered whether Coach Payson
would see fit to start him today with the first squad Kendalls
opinion of his football ability was modest but he firmly believed
that while there was undoubtedly plenty left for him to learn he
could play halfback as well as either Fayette or Crandall players who
thus far enjoyed the call for the position he coveted However he kept
this opinion to himself which was a wise thing to do

Fifteen minutes later one of a dozen candidates for places behind the
line who were busily engaged in catching punts and running them back
he spied the redoubtable Cotton long lanky awkward and bewildered
hurling himself to the ground in the effort to land upon a deceptive
pigskin tossed by the hand of a bored and pessimistic veteran to whom
the drudgery of breaking in a squad of green candidates had been
entrusted Cotton was suitably arrayed and his canvas breeches and
cleated shoes held the stamp of newness The striped blue and white
jersey however in which the upper part of his thin body was attired
had evidently seen service of some kind Observing him a moment
Kendall decided that the jersey had not reached its present faded and
torn condition on the football field for Cotton was so palpably out
of his element that the spectacle he afforded was almost pathetic
Kendall recalling Wellingtons nonsense smiled Cotton he told
himself had a hard row to hoe before he reached the First Team

Still later after a full half hour of signal work in the squad
directed by Holmes Kendall walked back to the bench draping a blanket
over his shoulders and spied an empty space beside Cotton He was not
favorably impressed by that youth but the latters attempts had been
so pathetic and his countenance now showed so much weariness that
Kendall from kindness of heart squeezed into the space and asked
cheerfully how he had got on Cotton evidently did not for the minute
recognize in football togs his host of a few nights before nor did he
respond very affably to the overture Instead he shot a rather sullen
and somewhat suspicious glance at Kendall and said All right in a
tone that seemed to ask what business it was of the inquirers

Have you ever played before asked Kendall I think Wellington said
you had though

A little He examined Kendall curiously began to recall his features
and thawed I went out for the team last Fall buthe shrugged his
shoulders hinting at things too regrettable to mentionI didnt make
it Say youre Burtis arent you I didnt know you at first

Kendall acknowledged it What school were you at last year he asked
less from curiosity than a desire to seem friendly

Kingston Manor near Baltimore Its a pretty good school not as big
as this but I didnt care much for the fellows there It was awfully
cliquish Thats why I didnt get on the team I wasnt swell enough
for them He laughed disagreeably

Too bad Kendall tried to put into his voice sympathy he didnt
feel For some reason Cotton awakened a feeling in him closely akin
to dislike and it troubled Kendall for there seemed no excuse for
it Kendall could almost invariably find something to like in an
acquaintance and when he couldnt he still stopped short of actual
antipathy In the present case fearing that he was doing the other an
injustice he took especial pains to be nice They talked football for
a minute or two Cotton expressed doubt of obtaining a fair trial

I guess if you dont have friends here its about the same as it was
at Kingston oror anywhere else

I dont think that responded Kendall I dont believe they care
much here who or what you are if you can play football Why I didnt
know a soul in school when I got here last Fall I dont know very many
yet

Oh well you got taken up by Pennimore and that crowd replied
Cotton with something like a sneer

Not exactly that said Kendall quietly I did make a few friends
though of course but the reason I got on at football was because I
could do a little something and they found it out You buckle down and
learn the game Cotton and then if you can play fairly well youll
get your chance There isnt a squarer man alive than Coach Payson
and Captain Merriwell is a mighty good sort too Just the same it
wont do you any harm to meet fellows and I tell you what you do
Cotton you come down some evening and make a call Fellows are always
drifting in and out of our room Lots of them I dont know very well
myself but Gerald will introduce you

Thanks replied Cotton almost gratefully I will Wellington doesnt
like me very well I guess and I dont think much of him either Hes
a sort of a Smart Aleck isnt he

I dont know him very well answered Kendall noncommittally Here
comes the scrimmage Dont forget Cotton Come and see us some
evening

First and second squads called Mr Payson Line up as you did
yesterday

Blankets were tossed aside headguards caught up and twentytwo
eager aspirants thronged on to the field Kendall trotted out to his
place on the second squad Across the field at the other end of the
fifteenyard line was Greene Under the goal stood Holmes who was
fighting hard against Simms for the quarterback position Up the
field the first squad were lined up for the kickoff on their toes
awaiting the whistle Then Fales leftguard swung his long leg and
the brown oval came flying over the white lines turning lazily in
its flight Down rushed the enemy The second squad defenders moved to
the left to meet the onslaught as the ball dipped into Greenes arms
The interference formed quickly Bodies thudded together players went
down Greene clutching the ball shot forward three players cutting
a path for him A feint to the left a quick turn to the right and
the opening was found One two three white lines passed under his
pounding feet Then a lithe body sprang upon him Greene struggled
forward Another foeman charged and the three went down The whistle
piped

First down Ten to go called the referee

There was a quick liningup Holmes rattled off the signal Kendall
trotted back to punting position Best at center passed the ball
Kendall caught it breasthigh stepped forward swung his leg and away
hurtled the pigskin arching high against the blue afternoon sky and
away sped the players to line up again on the first squads thirty
yards The punt had been a good one fortyfive yards in distance and
high enough to let the ends down under it and upset the runner before
he could more than get started

There was no scoring in the first tenminute period Andy Ryan kept a
close watch on the water pail for the day was warm and the temptation
to drink a dipperful was great Easy with the water boys he
counseled time and again And Get your blankets on Dont stand
around there getting cold Have you no sense at all There were many
changes for the last period but Kendall was retained and since the
first squad seemed to have gained more by the influx of fresh material
than the second and forced the playing from the start he was needed
Five times he was called on to punt out of danger from under his own
goal and as many times coolly and exactly as though he were practicing
on an empty gridiron he responded successfully Then in the last
minute of play the tragedy occurred First swept down to the twenty
yards Two tries netted but four yards more A forward pass unexpected
and well executed went to Cousins but Kendall downed him in his
fourth stride and the ball went to the second on her fifteenyard line
Folsom who had taken Holmes place at quarter called on Kendall and
Kendall dropped back just under the crossbar For once Best passed
badly The ball struck the ground a yard in front of the punter and
although Kendall got it on the bound and swung and even started the
kick away the first squad forwards crashed through the ball struck an
upraised hand and Captain Merriwell fell on it behind the goalline
Simms missed a tryatgoal Score first squad  second squad 

A moment later panting tired aching the players trotted up the
hill to the gymnasium blankets trailing and flapping to feel the
grateful splash of the warm water over their bodies to writhe and gasp
as the icycold deluge followed and to talk it all over accusing
defending explaining regretting exulting Then to dress leisurely
weariedly and withal happily in an atmosphere of steam and witch hazel
and arnica in a babel of talk and laughter silently resolving better
things for next practice wondering how they could live through the
whole long hour that must elapse before they could have supper




CHAPTER IV

AT SOUND VIEW


The Pennimore country place Sound View lies within a half mile of the
school buildings and adjoins the school property on the west Taking
the path across The Prospect as the terrace of lawn in front of Oxford
Hall was called descending a flight of steps crossing the curving
drive and continuing the path again beyond you come to a rustic bridge
which surmounts a twentyfoot cut Through this the railroad runs
almost due east and west in the latter direction ultimately reaching
like so many of the boys who graduate in sight of the cut the city
of New Haven Eastward at a nearly corresponding distance lies
Newport But Kendall was thinking of neither New Haven nor Newport as
shortly after morning church the next day he crossed the bridge and
entered the woods He was taking the shortest route to Sound View and
he was wondering whether the suit of clothes he had put on in honor
of the occasion really looked as well as it had seemed to him He had
brushed and rebrushed for a quarter of an hour and had worked with
soap and water and a corner of a towel for as much longer in an attempt
to eradicate stains from the jacket The latter effort had not been
altogether successful but he flattered himself that if you didnt
look very close you couldnt see the obnoxious spots At the dividing
of the path he chose the righthand way and in a minute or two came
within sight of the high fence which divided the school grounds from
Mr Pennimores land It was a warm but cloudy afternoon with a little
gusty breeze coming in off the Sound and lazily moving the leaves
Presently he reached a narrow gate set in the fence There was a round
hole in it and he put his hand through and lifted a latch on the
further side Then he stepped in wound by a broad bed of shrubbery
following a welltrodden path and found himself finally on the seaward
side of the big stone house with a wide expanse of lawn and flowerbeds
and borders of shrubs near at hand and the Sound looking rather
green and sullen today stretching away into the distance beyond A
big white steam yacht swung idly at her moorings off the mouth of the
river and near a long steel and granite wharf A sudden barking of dogs
brought Kendalls gaze back to the direction of the house just in time
for him to see Gerald vault over the low wall of the terrace and start
to meet him An instant later a wirehaired terrier rushed down the
steps frantic with excitement followed more leisurely by a red setter

Hello called Gerald I thought youd missed your way Why didnt
you come earlier

Well you said to come for dinner replied Kendall stooping to pat
the setter who was wagging him a welcome I thought halfpast twelve
was early enough Whats his name Gerald

The setters His name is Jack Ive had him for years The other
little duffer who wants to sample your trousers but doesnt quite
dare to is Three Foot so called because when he is very anxious to
get anywhere he picks up one foot and travels on the other three Come
on up and sit down Warm isnt it Dad had to go down to New York
last night and hasnt got back yet I sent the car over to meet the
eleventhirty train but he wasnt on it He will be sorry not to be
here to meet you Youve never met the Dad have you

Once for a minute or two last Spring over at Broadwood But I guess
he wouldnt remember me

Dont you believe it Dad never forgets anything Sit down and get
cool Have some water or a glass of ginger ale or something

Kendall declined as he sank into a long rattan chair and fanned himself
with his hat Is that your yacht he asked

Yesthat is its Dads Mine is a bit smaller Gerald smiled
About a hundred and twentyfive feet shorter Well try her after
dinner I asked Harry Merrow to go along Dont mind do you

Not a bit I like Merrow although I dont know him very well He
spoke to me the other day after mathematics and we had a talk

Hes a very decent kid I suppose Gerald added with a laugh hes
only a year younger than I am but hes always seemed a lot younger to
me

I guess hes about sixteen Youre seventeen arent you

Yes Ill be eighteen next Fall when I get to Yale I suppose thats
early enough but Id have made it this year if Dad hadnt kept me on
a diet of tutors for so long It was funny the way I happened to go to
Yardley Jack was mixed up in it werent you old doggums

Jack stretched on the stones at Geralds feet thumped his tail
affirmatively

How did it happen asked Kendall

Well over there near where you came through the gate I used to have a
playhouse when I was a kid Once somebody gave me a firemans uniform
as a present you know red blouse and helmet and a brass trumpet and
so on So one day I thought it would be a bright idea to have a real
fire and do a rescue stunt So I put on my firemans outfit got an ax
from the stable shut Jack in the playhouse and set fire to it

Thunder exclaimed Kendall

Also lightning agreed Gerald It was a fool thing to do and Jack
might have been burned to a crisp because I locked the door and threw
the key away for some unknown reason And the first thing I knew the
place was burning like a bonfire Not that I was troubling much
however Id brought along a couple of those chemical extinguishers
from the house and my plan was to break open the door rescue Jack
heroically just like a sureenough firefighter and then put out
the flames with the extinguishers Poor old Jack was howling like a
good one and I was telling him to keep his courage up or something
like that when a fellow sang out from the other side of the fence and
wanted to know what I was doing I told him and invited him over to
help I think he called me a silly little fool which was impolite
but dreadfully true Then he jumped over grabbed the ax away from
me and beat in the door The place was just a mass of flames inside
and Jack was stretched out like dead I guess the poor old fellow was
scared stiff So then there was nothing to do but go in and get him
The trouble was that after I reached Jack I was too choked up with
smoke and too frightened to get out again and if the other chap hadnt
lugged us both outwell you wouldnt be sitting here and neither
would I nor Jack We all got scorched a little and we boys were put to
bed and had to be dosed and fixed up by the doctor and there was a big
old fuss

What an awful thing to do said Kendall Why you might have been
burned horribly Who was the other boy

Dan Vinton And thats how I happened to go to Yardley to school Id
had about half a dozen tutors and none of them would stay very long
because I was a mean little brat and made their lives a burden to them
I guess Dad sort of fell in love with Dan just as I did and after
a while when I insisted that I wouldnt be happy if I couldnt go to
Yardley Dad let me go on the understanding that Dan was to take charge
of me You see Dad was away a good deal more then than he is now So
I went to room with Dan and he made me toe the mark too I was like
a kid with three nurses for when Dan wasnt looking after me then Alf
Loring or Tom Dyer was Well I had my troubles for a while but I got
through with them It did me a lot of good I tell you Kendall for
I was in a fair way to become a conceited puny little idiot Why I
didnt know what it was to be hungry until I went to Yardley and played
football and lived out of doors I tell you the fellow that doesnt go
to a school where he can mix with other fellows and be thrown on his
own resources and fight his own battles is mighty unfortunate

I suppose so agreed Kendall but it must be pretty hard on some
fellows Take chaps who are shy and have been made a lot of at home
Gerald I guess they get pretty unhappy sometimes at boarding school

Rather I was so homesick andand miserable that I ran away once and
went home to New York And Dan came after me and lugged me back Oh I
know what it is about as well as any fellow And thats why I always
try to be friendly with the youngsters that come to school looking as
though they were walking into a den of lions You come across them
every day at this time of year trailing around by themselves and
looking sort of red about the eyes and doleful all over I know about
how they feel homesick and scared of the other fellows and scared
of faculty and scared of their lessons Its bad while it lasts but
it doesnt last long Some morning you wake up with an appetite for
breakfast that almost makes you ache and some fellow says Hello
kid to you as you go downstairs and smiles at you or maybe claps you
on the back and you eat a big breakfast and sort of look around and
think how jolly everything looks and how friendly the fellows seem all
of a sudden And you wake up to the fact that you belong that youre
one of the crowd that youre a Yardley Hall fellow And you walk out
of commons with a bit of a swagger and begin to try and decide whether
to be captain of the football team or a First Honors man

Kendall smiled appreciatively He had been through it himself and it
was just as Gerald had described it And he believed he knew a little
better now why Gerald had picked him for a roommate

Another thing continued Gerald rubbing Jacks ribs with one foot
that sort of thing has to come some time anyway I mean thatthat
stagefright or whatever you want to call it If you dont go through
with it at prep school youll have to face it later perhaps when you
go to college or perhaps when you go into business Every fellow has
to face it some time Its a good deal like being tossed into the water
and told to swim You swim after a fashionbecause you have to to keep
afloat but youre scared to death at first After a bit you like it
and they cant keep you out of the water unless they tie you up

Thats something I cant do said Kendall swim

You cant asked Gerald incredulously Its high time you learned
then Where have you been all your life

On a farm laughed Kendall Im a hayseed

Arent afraid of the water are you

Nno I think not I rather like it only Ive never tried to swim in
it

Thats good Just as long as you arent scared at the outset youll
get on all right You want to keep in your mind the fact that the Lord
gave you air to breathe in ground to walk on and water to swim in and
that youre just about as safe one place as another Ill have to take
you in hand some day soon and teach you to swim

I wish you would Ive always wanted to know how

A minute later they went in to dinner followed by the two dogs
and sat at opposite sides of a round table and were attended by a
seriousfaced butler Kendall held the butler in a good deal of awe
and marveled at the casual almost disrespectful way in which his host
addressed that functionary Once or twice he almost held his breath for
fear that the butler whose name appeared to be Murdock at times and at
other times Scout would take umbrage at the way in which Gerald bossed
him around And when finally Gerald said carelessly Thats all
Murdock for a while Just beat it will you Kendall was quite sure
that Murdock would immediately pack his trunk and leave But he didnt
for when it was time for the dessert Gerald pressed a button and
Murdock noiselessly reappeared just as though nothing had happened
That dinner was one to remember and dream about and both boys though
more especially Kendall enjoyed it heartily from the funny little
disks of toast covered with some sort of paste that tasted like fish
and which following Geralds lead Kendall anointed with lemonjuice
to the black coffee served in cups so frail that Kendall almost feared
to lift one

Afterwards they went upstairs to Geralds room and saw his treasures
of various kinds and sat in a broad windowseat that overlooked the
Sound And at about three a maid announced the arrival of Harry Merrow
and they arose with sighs and returned to the terrace

Harry Merrow didnt look to be sixteen by a full year He was small of
build and slim of body with a somewhat thin face that lacked color He
had nice eyes which were the saving of an otherwise rather featureless
face He jumped out of a chair as the other boys emerged from the house
and came to meet them

Its all right he announced merrily Ive insured my life for its
full value Gerald and now wheres the boat

I guess you didnt have to pay a very heavy premium Gerald laughed
Come inside and lets get some sweaters It may be cold on the water
even if it isnt here

The dogs accompanied them down to the pier barking excitedly but
there Gerald sent them sternly back to the house The launch which
rocked gently at the side of the float won loud praise from Harry

Say Gerald shes a beauty When did you get her This summer How
fast can she go My wordy look at all the brass on her Glad I dont
have to keep her polished

The Dart was eighteen feet over all with a six foot beam She had
a cruising cabin with two bunks and a tiny galley Her hull was of
white cedar painted light gray with a gold line while the inboard
finish was mahogany She was a handsome little craft and even Kendall
whose knowledge of boats was limited knew that she was a launch to be
proud of The boys sprang aboard and looked her all over from stem to
stern Harry had to stretch out on a bunk before he was satisfied and
insisted on having the small stove lighted so he could see just how it
worked Finally returning to the cockpit Gerald started the engine
Harry under his directions cast off the moorings and The Dart
headed out to sea




CHAPTER V

LOST IN THE FOG


Southward lay Plum Island seven miles distant and beyond it the main
shore of Long Island was hazily visible To the southeast in clear
weather one could see Montauk Point but today it was hidden by a
fog bank There were numerous sailing craft in sight and an excursion
steamer well loaded with passengers passed down the Sound a half mile
away an occasional blare of music from her band reaching them on the
breeze There was very little sea today and The Dart sped along on
an almost even keel And how she did go Fourteen miles said Gerald
but it seemed to Kendall that it must be more than that Gerald from
where he sat at the wheel in the cockpit could look along the roof
of the cabin and had a clear view of the course Everything for the
control of the launch was within reach spark throttle clutches and a
strident electric whistle

Its just like an automobile isnt it said Harry with a sigh of
envious admiration

Its better laughed Gerald There arent any tires to blow out

Kendall perched himself in the stern where he could watch and enjoy the
rush of the green water Harry stretched himself along the cabin roof
Are you going all the way across he asked

Gerald shook his head No Im going to turn in a few minutes and run
up toward Fishers Island Theres fog over there and I dont want to
get caught in it Were three or four miles out now I guess

When presently The Dart turned her head eastward the breeze was
less apparent For a moment the sun broke through and the waters of the
Sound took on new shades of paler green as they broke past the stern
But the clouds soon closed again Harry lying against the low handrail
at the edge of the cabin roof showed an inclination toward slumber
Gerald and Kendall chatted of a hundred things while the launch
shot her way steadily and swiftly along Fishers Island grew larger
and nearer A fourmasted schooner lazily dipped by and a long low
torpedo destroyer her battleshipgray hull scarcely distinguishable
from the sullen water steamed toward the mouth of the Thames River
probably on her way to the Navy Yard above New London Suddenly a
slight exclamation from Gerald brought Kendalls attention back from
the wickedlooking craft Gerald was gazing southward in surprise All
vestige of Long Island was gone and a bank of gray fog was advancing
across the Sound

I dont like that muttered Gerald and The Dart circled rapidly
and shot away toward home The sudden turn disturbed Harrys dreams and
he looked down at the others blinking inquiringly

What was that Who shoved me I say Gerald look at the fog out
there will you Hadnt we better beat it

Were beating it now answered Gerald grimly advancing the throttle
lever a little The steady whirr of the propeller increased and there
was a louder sound from the engine below Take the wheel a minute
Kendall while I douse some oil Hold her just as she is

Kendall scrambled over and gripped the rim of the wheel while Gerald
stepped into the cabin and poked around with a longnosed oilcan The
Dart was headed straight back for Wissining but there was a good five
miles ahead of her and the fogbank was rolling in fast Kendall viewed
it apprehensively without realizing just what it meant It moved
toward them steadily inexorably At first nearly a mile away now it
was less than half that distance While he looked a sloop beating
toward Orient Point grew suddenly faint to view then disappeared
utterly from sight Gerald came back and took the wheel

Well be in it in another five minutes he said Hustle down Harry
and dig the foghorn out of that after locker Thats it Know how to
work it Just turn the handle around as though you were churning ice
cream or grinding coffee

Harry obeyed and a most dismal bellow was emitted from the box Isnt
it sweet laughed Harry Want me to do it again Gerald

Not yet Put it up on the roof and when the fog hits us give her a
turn every half minute or so

How far from home are we asked Gerald looking down the shore

Oh three miles or so Shes making a good sixteen miles now but Ill
have to bring her down to four or five in a minute or two Here she
comes fellows

There was a faint damp puff of wind in their faces Then it passed
over them and gradually the shore line was blotted from sight Around
them fell a gray blanket of mist Twenty feet away in any direction the
eye lost itself in the fog The Dart slowed down and the triumphant
whirr of the screw died away to a timid thudding The engine clicked
feebly and the rods at the sides of the cylinders moved up and down as
though grown suddenly weary

Harry get busy with your horn directed Gerald Kendall you crawl
along to the bow and keep your eyes peeled If you see anything even
a log of wood yell back to me Well be home in half an hour or so
now but I dont want to run down a Fall River steamer or anything like
that Its awfully bad for your paint

At intervals Harry turned the crank of the patent foghorn and a
lugubrious wail arose to lose itself in the impenetrable mist Between
times from various directions far and near came similar sounds Save
for these warnings the silence was deep What breeze there had been
was scarcely perceptible although the bank of fog was not stationary
but moved constantly across them toward the mainland Once or twice
its grayness was tinged with amber as for a moment only the sun
came through the clouds above Kendall seated at the forward end
of the cabin roof strained his eyes into the blank wall ahead Ten
minutes passed From somewhere off the bow came the faint shriek of a
locomotive

Cant be far out now observed Gerald Can you see anything
Kendall

Not a thing butI think I hear something

So do I Get busy with that horn Harry And Gerald seizing the
whistle pull sent a series of frantic blasts into the air that so
surprised Kendall that he almost fell overboard Then Harry worked the
horn again and after that they listened intently From somewhere ahead
came the loud beat of an engine Then a hoarse shriek broke the silence

Shes a steamer muttered Gerald and a big one I guess Again he
sent the short sharp peals of the whistle into the air Now they could
hear the beat of the propeller on the approaching steamer Again her
foghorn tore the silence asunder

Shes right on us cried Harry grinding frantically at the crank
Gerald standing at the wheel peering forward worked desperately at
the whistle pull and jammed a lever over The Dart lost headway
slowed stopped The loud throb of the steamers screw seemed all about
them Uncertainly Gerald started The Dart forward again turning
her nose to starboard Then as another hoarse bellow came to them he
stopped the launch as suddenly and pulled the lever to reverse The
launch began backing away circling slowly to an accompaniment of
hysterical shrieks of the whistle and agonized groans of the foghorn

Come back here Kendall called Gerald and Kendall scurried for the
cockpit There was a sudden swash as of a wave running up a beach
and then

Hold on hard fellows shouted Gerald twirling the wheel

To the right off the port bow of the launch a hulking shadow took
shape a shadow that loomed high above the water and broadened
instantly into the black bow of a steamer Somewhere up there a voice
shouted and was drowned in the roar of the whistle For a long moment
the three boys cowering in the cockpit of the launch frozen into
silence neither spoke nor moved Then Gerald seized a cushion from a
seat and thrust it at Kendall

Hold tight to that and jump he cried Quick




CHAPTER VI

THE RESCUE


Kendall clutching the corkfilled cushion hesitated but another
glance at the towering black shadow almost against them decided him
Harry was already in the water Gerald poised on the combing cried to
him again and so holding the cushion to his breast Kendall leaped
He felt the water close over him heard its surge in his ears Then
fighting for breath choked by the water he had swallowed he found
himself afloat buoyed up by the cushion Instinctively he worked his
legs as he had seen swimmers do striving to win out of the path of the
steamer A voice called near at hand

Gerald Kendall

Kendall tried to answer but seemingly had no voice and only succeeded
in choking and coughing But Gerald from somewhere in the fog replied

Over here Harry Can you keep afloat Wheres Kendall

This time Kendall managed to answer

Im here Im all right Did she hit us

I dont know Find Kendall Harry Hes got a cushion that will keep
you up too Call again Kendall

Then from a distance away muffled by the fog came a hail

Launch ahoy Are you all right

Were in the water called Gerald Cant see our launch

What asked the voice evidently through a megaphone

Gerald repeated

Hold on then Were dropping a boat

The voice was fainter Gerald swam out of the mist and made toward
Kendall calling to Harry Harry replied and in a moment joined the
others Take hold of the cushion Gerald panted Itll hold you both
up

Take hold yourself said Harry struggling for breath Im all
right If Ididnt have these shoes on

I think this will hold us all up said Kendall weakly He eased away
from the cushion

Careful said Gerald Keep one arm over it Thats it Lay hold of a
corner Harry and rest a bit

I will if you will said Harry stubbornly

All right Gerald took a grip on the cushion and Harry followed
suit and although it sank a little it sustained them

Theyre going to pick us up said Gerald All right Kendall

All right replied Kendall But his teeth were chattering and he felt
a little faint

If I could get this old sweater off Harry was muttering when a hail
came across the water

Which way called a voice

Over here Gerald shouted loudly Then they heard the creak of oars
in locks and after a moment of suspense during which Gerald shouted
again a boat took shape in the grayness and came toward them It was
manned by two sailors and a young man in uniform who stood in the bow

All right kids he said cheerfully Well get you in Pull around a
bit to starboard men Now then one at a time boys Give me a hand

The young officer had made his way to the stern of the small boat while
talking and now leaned over toward the group in the water as the rowers
backed the boat nearer

You first Kendall Gerald directed Kendall stretched forth an arm
and the young officer seized his wrist and in a moment he was squirming
across the gunwale Once inside he subsided between two seats and
closed his eyes dizzily When he opened them again Gerald and Harry
were out of the water and the officer was asking Gerald if he wanted to
pick up the cushion

Never mind it thanks answered Gerald I guess the launch is gone
anyway

No we passed it back there and I guess we can find it again all
right Give way men

Then you didnt strike it asked Gerald in surprise

Just grazed it I guess The lookout saw you and we sheered off in
time not to sink you You fellows take my advice and keep off the water
in weather like this

The steamer sent a blast of her whistle and the rowers altered their
course a little

We were trying to get home when the fog closed in on us replied
Gerald

I see Well what do you want us to do with you Put you aboard your
launch or take you with us We cant tow that boat of yours of course
but shell be picked up sooner or later I guess Were bound for New
Haven

There she is sir announced one of the sailors as the launch
appeared through the fog

Just put us aboard her if you please said Gerald Well be all
right thank you It was very kind of you to pick us up

The officer laughed He was a finelooking chap of twentyone or two
bronzed and blueeyed Well we couldnt do much less I guess Glad
things didnt turn out any worse boys Live around here do you

Wissining answered Harry We go to school there Yardley Hall you
know

Whats your boat please asked Gerald

Conomoit Captain Livingstone Newport News

And what line sir

Blue Cross Line Say youre a bit particular aint you about who
pulls you out of the water Or are you going to sue for damages
Anything else youd like to know And the officers blue eyes twinkled

Id like to know your name please replied Gerald smiling

Oh my name My names Hallet Second Officer

Thank you answered Gerald Were very much obliged to you

Youre welcome Say thats a fine looking little launch there Glad
we didnt rip her up boys Over with you please

The Dart apparently unscathed although later Gerald found a long
smear of black paint along the side where the steamer had grazed was
rocking quietly enough in the little oily waves as the sailors paddled
the rowboat alongside Gerald had thrown the clutch out before he
jumped overboard but the engine was still running One by one the boys
climbed across to the wet fogdrenched cockpit

Good luck called their rescuer Keep your whistle going Give way
men

The small boat disappeared into the fog the crew of The Dart waving
goodby Then Harry you and Kendall go down there and get your wet
clothes off said Gerald Youll find towels in the bottom of the
righthand locker Rub yourself dry and put some blankets around you
Ill stay here and keep the horn going until you get fixed up

Whats the matter with you doing it asked Harry Youre as wet as I
am

You do as I say replied Gerald shortly Im boss on this ship
Hurry up now

Kendalls teeth chattered so as he pulled and tugged at his wet
garments that Harry became alarmed and went to his assistance But
when they had rubbed their bodies into a glow with the coarse bath
towels they felt rather better for their bath than worse They took
Geralds place on deck and he disappeared to follow the same course
of treatment The discarded clothing was wrung out and hung about to
dry if it would and the three mariners attired in gray blankets
presented a ludicrous appearance

I hope no one will see us laughed Harry as Gerald joined them in the
cockpit We might be taken for the Flying Dutchman

You look more like an Indian said Kendall What shall we do when we
get ashore We cant go up to school in these blankets

Well get ashore first replied Gerald and decide that afterwards
Have you heard the Conomoits whistle lately

Yes a minthere it is now

Gerald stared into the fog striving to locate exactly the direction of
the steamer Which way did that come from he asked puzzledly

Over there said Harry pointing to port

Over there said Kendall pointing over the bow

Then the three looked at each other in dawning dismay I thought it
was more back there said Gerald doubtfully Lets wait until we hear
it again But when it came again it was further away and might have
proceeded from almost any point at their right

Thats funny said Harry The last time it seemed more over there

The launch has swung around probably said Gerald Well well
have to make a try anyway Theres no use staying here and drifting
around the Sound He started the launch slowly ahead and turned her
nose toward where in his belief the Connecticut shore lay some mile
and a half away Harry went back to the foghorn and Kendall resumed
his position as lookout in the bow Now and then a whistle sounded at
a distance in one direction or another and once they heard the slow
steady beat of a propeller through the enveloping mist but no craft
came very near them and The Dart proceeding slowly and cautiously
with Harry winding lugubrious wails of warning from the patent foghorn
every half minute or so and Kendall straining his eyes into the gray
wall ahead slid through the water In spite of the fact that it seemed
quite probable that they might have to spend the night wandering around
the Sound the three boys were in high spirits due doubtless to the
reaction which usually follows a moment of peril and chattered like
magpies It was unanimously agreed that it would be quite unnecessary
to mention their misadventure to anyone

Toby would probably tell us to keep off the water said Harry And I
guess your father would have something to say too Gerald

Gerald smiled He probably would Its all over and Ive learned my
lesson which is keep on dry land when theres a fog in sight Kendall
were you scared

Kendall hesitated a moment Then Yes he answered quite honestly I
was I wasnt scared when I was in the water so much but I certainly
hated to take that jump

I dont blame you said Harry Its no fun when you cant swim
Thats something youll have to learn Burtis

Im going to I dont believe itll be hard I swam a little today

Harry laughed Of course you could with a cork cushion under your
chin Youll find it different when theres nothing to hold you up

Dont discourage him said Gerald smiling Well take him down
to the river some day Harry and put him through his stunts See
anything Kendall

Nothing replied the lookout at the bow Theres a sound somewhere
though They all listened Then Harry gave a shout

Its a train Gerald We must be getting near shore

Yes And I think I hear a bell Do you

The others agreed that they did Its a fogbell on some ship said
Gerald Lets make for it and maybe they can tell us where we are
He turned the bow of The Dart a little more to starboard and they
ran slowly on the dingdong of the unseen bell growing momentarily
louder

Presently Why were you so anxious to find out the name of that
steamer asked Harry

I thought that perhaps it was one of Dads boats replied Gerald

Oh And was it

Yes a Blue Cross boat Im going to send that chap something He was
awfully decent to us

Why not seeing that he ran us down laughed Harry

I guess it was quite as much our fault as theirs Yell if you see
anything Kendall

Not a thing yet Gerald That bells getting pretty near though

Thats what I think responded Gerald peering ahead I wonder where
the dickens we are It would be a joke on us if we found ourselves down
near New London somewhere Perhaps that bells on some lighthouse
fellows Guess not though it doesnt sound like it Well well soon
find out Hello

What asked Harry working another groan from the horn

I thought I saw something ahead there but its gone now Did you see
anything Kendall

Nno I dont think so Sometimes the fog sort of thickens and you
think you see things like shadows

And then the bell which had not sounded for a minute clanged again
and Gerald snatched at a lever for it seemed almost at their bow And
as The Dart slid through the water silently with diminishing speed
something took shape in the fog ahead of them

Land exclaimed Harry

Its a boat called Kendall Straight ahead of us Gerald Youd
better stop

Gerald reversed the propeller The Dart churned the water at her
stern and quivered as she began to back By this time they could see
the amidship section of a white vessel Gerald raised his voice as the
bell clanged its two notes once more

Ahoy there

Ahoy answered a voice startlingly near

Weve lost our bearings How far is the shore

About three hundred feet

Oh Well where are we

Pretty nigh off the mouth of the Wissining River Where do you want to
get to

Wissining River Thenthen what boats that

Steam yacht Princess New York at anchor

Why that began Harry excitedly

Ssh cautioned Gerald Then Thank you he called to the invisible
informant Were all right then

Very cautiously The Dart circled away and made a detour of the
yachts bow I didnt want him to see us said Gerald with a chuckle
He might have recognized the launch and told Dad some time That was
Purdy the steward Keep your eyes peeled Kendall and watch for the
pier

A few minutes later The Dart was snuggled up to the float the lines
were made fast and the three boys were stumbling up the gangplank with
their blankets flapping around them and their wet clothing in their
arms The fog seemed less heavy on shore but it was still so thick
that they almost reached the house before they saw it Gerald led the
way around to a side entrance from which treading softly and giggling
as they went they climbed to Geralds room without being seen One
after another they took possession of the bathtub and then scrambled
for the dry clothing that Gerald provided The garments didnt fit very
well but they answered the purpose When a maid arrived in response to
Geralds ring she was sworn to silence and given the wet clothing

Put them where theyll dry in a hurry said Gerald Has Father
returned yet

No sir He telephoned he wouldnt be home until tomorrow morning

Gerald gave a sigh of relief as the maid closed the door Of course
Im sorry hes not going to be here for supper he explained but
it might have been difficult to explain the costumes you fellows are
wearing Harry that coat looks as though you expected to grow a whole
lot in the next half hour

Well it may be a bit large allowed Harry but its some coat just
the same Its a heap dressier than anything I own What are we going
to do while those things dry Gerald

Anything you like Well go down and have a fire in the library and
take it easy You fellows will stay for supper you know and by the
time Ive killed this appetite of mine your clothes will be ready I
guess Come on down

For an hour or more they sat in front of the fire and talked of a
hundred things their voices growing drowsier and drowsier as time
passed Then just when Harry had begun to snore melodiously in his big
armchair supper was announced In spite of all the dinner they had
eaten their afternoon adventures had created fine new appetites and
all three did full justice to the supper By eight oclock the clothes
were pronounced ready to wear again and Harry and Kendall changed back
to their own garments Half an hour later the three trudged back to
school by way of the village Gerald having decided since his father
was not to be at home that evening to return with the others They
parted from Harry at Whitson after he had been again sworn to secrecy
and rather tired and very sleepy crawled the two flights of stairs to
Number  Clarke As Kendall lighted the light Gerald caught sight of a
card on the table and picked it up

What the dickens is this he said Charles Phillip Cotton Now who
is he and why does he leave a visiting card

Hes that chap who rooms with Wellington answered Kendall The
fellow they chased into my room that night Dont you remember

Oh that duffer Well what does he want here

II told him Id be glad to have him look me up Hehe doesnt know
many fellows and

Oh I see Gerald crumpled up the card and tossed it into the waste
basket All right but he must be a silly chump to leave a calling
card here What does he think this is Fifth Avenue

If youd rather he didnt call began Kendall

Not a bit of it Maybe hes better than he looks You ask any fellows
you want Kendall Personally I dont think Id ever get very fond of
Mr Cotton but if you like him its all right

I dont think I dovery much Only he seemed kind of out of it and I
thought if he came in here some time he might meet some of the fellows
Hes out for the team you know

Not the football team asked Gerald pausing in the middle of a yawn
Kendall nodded Gerald grinned and completed his yawn Then Well
hes got plenty of cheek hasnt he Fancy Mr Cotton playing football
If I wasnt so sleepy Kendall Id laugh

And if I wasnt so sleepy murmured Kendall Id have a go at my
German

Oh hush said Gerald crawling into bed with a long sigh of delight
Dont mention study to a manwhos just beenrescuedwatery
grave

Then he slept




CHAPTER VII

GERALD MAPS A CAMPAIGN


Two afternoons later Kendall ran across Charles Cotton on the football
field Cotton was still struggling along with the awkward squad
and when Kendall chasing a pigskin that had gone over his head
encountered him he was on his way to the bench

Sorry I wasnt at home Sunday when you called said Kendall I hope
youll try again

Oh it didnt matter Cotton replied I didnt have anything to do
and just thought Id drop in for a minute

Glad you did Hope Ill be there next time How are you getting on

Pretty fair

Kendall nodded and went his way while Cotton standing where he was
watched the other boy pick up the ball and hurl it cleverly back across
the field Thinks hes a smart guy he muttered with a curl of his
lip Some day Ill tell him what I think of him and his patronizing
ways Not till I get what I want out of him though

The first game of the season that with Greenburg High School was
only four days away and this afternoon the scrimmage was longer than
heretofore For the first time the school was able to get an idea of
how the First Team or Varsity would be made up Cousins played left
end that afternoon Plant left tackle Fales left guard Girard
center McKesson right guard Stark right tackle Adler right end
Simms quarter Crandall left half Fayette right half and Marion
fullback Of course McKesson at guard was only temporary for that
was Captain Merriwells position and a good many looked for a change
at right end before the season was much older But it was generally
agreed that the First Team as made up this afternoon would with one
or two changes and barring accidents and unforeseen circumstances play
the season through A Second Team captained by Jim Hough was also
formed and it was this Second Team that went up against the First for
three twelveminute periods and was badly beaten

The first cut came on Wednesday and some twentyodd fellows left the
squad and swallowed their disappointment The First Team retained
thirtysix players for the present and the Second Team twentythree
Charles Cotton survived the weedingout process and remained among the
First Team substitutes He was trying for end Kendall was a little
disappointed at finding himself second choice but was comforted with
the knowledge that he was certain of getting into a full share of the
games since he was by far the best goal kicker in the squad Holmes
who since the beginning of practice had been pushing Albert Simms
hard for the quarter position was more disappointed than Kendall It
was his last year and he had been after the place ever since he had
entered Yardley

On Thursday the Second surprised themselves and everyone else by
rushing the First Team off its feet in two periods and finally winning
the practice game by  to  scoring two touchdowns and missing
the goal in each case The First Team got a touchdown and Kendall
called on from the sideline kicked the goal Later in the final
period having substituted Crandall he added another three points by
a goal from the field But that wasnt enough to beat the Second and
Hughs charges gamboled off highly pleased with themselves There was
no practice on Friday although the players listened to a halfhour
lecture in the gymnasium and afterward walked through a few simple
plays

Greenburg High School was not a formidable opponent and the contest
on Saturday was not much more than a glorified practice game The
school turned out to a fellow and filled the grand stand and nibbled
peanuts and applauded every opportunity Merriwell played through the
first two periods and then gave way to McKesson In the third period
Yardley presented an almost entirely new lineup Steger went in for
Plant Jackson for Fales Best for Girard Adler for Metz Holmes for
Simms Kendall for Fayette and Brinspool for Marion Greenburg also
seized the opportunity to try out her new material and the latter
part of the game was something of a comedy of errors Yardley already
had a score of  to  and Holmes received instructions to score by
straight football only That however proved easier to say than to do
Greenburg even with a substitute backfield and a rather inexperienced
line was quick and heady and stopped the Yardley attack for short
gains time after time The third period ended without a score for
either side

Up on the grand stand with a bag of peanuts between them Gerald and
Harry sat in the warm sunlight and viewed the contest with mild and
critical interest

More changes murmured Harry as the fourth period was about to
begin Best is coming off and Lin Johnson is going in And there goes
Folsom to take Holmess place Say wouldnt you hate to be a football
coach Gerald

Why

Oh think of having to lick a bunch like that into shape every year
Gee Id get so discouraged Id want to quit sometimes

But you mustnt judge a team by the first game it plays answered
Gerald Wait a month and then have a look

I know Somebodys hurt There goes Andy with the water pail Isnt
it funny that as long as weve been playing football Gerald nobodys
ever thought to carry water on to the field in anything but a pail

What would they carry it in A tumbler

No but you cant run with a pail of water without splashing most of
it out Look at that Why not use a can or something with a lid Who is
that chap Whoever he is theyre taking him out Its Adler isnt it

I dont know him Somebodys given him a nasty looking eye though

I should say so Yes thats Adler Hes after Cousinss place Whos
the funny looking guy Paysons sending in

Oh his name is Cotton He doesnt look much as though he could play
end does he

Cotton Harry watched the substitute run on to the field Who is he

I dont know I met him a week or so ago Hes rooming with The Duke
in Clarke Hes new this Fall

Funny muttered Harry but I seem to know that chap Name sounds
familiar too Cotton  Cotton

Hes a protg of Kendalls said Gerald Kendall has taken pity on
him because hes new and doesnt know many fellows He asked him around
and he came last Sunday while we were away Left his visiting card
What do you know about that for style

Well whoever he is he cant play end said Harry in disgust That
Greenburg tackle is making him look like a canceled stamp

Harry stopped so abruptly that Gerald turned to regard him curiously
Whats the matter he asked

Harry shook his head He was staring across the field at Cotton with a
frown of perplexity on his face Nothing he answered finally Only
that fellow bothers me Im almost certain Ive seen him somewhere
before

Youve probably seen him in class or around school said Gerald
Thats not quite impossible you know

But Harry again shook his head If Id seen him here before Id
remember it Almost seems as if Id met him Where does he come from

I dont know Hold on though seems to me The Duke said he came from
Maryland

Well it wasnt there for Ive never been in Maryland except to go
through it on a train There goes Kendall with the ball Good work
Burtis That fellow is certainly a wonder at keeping his feet Gerald

And hes pretty good at keeping his head too replied Gerald with a
smile

Funny idea you taking him in with you though said Harry I like
him first rate but

But what asked Gerald

Oh I dont know He seems hardly your style Thats all

Gerald was silent a moment watching the efforts of Yardley to carry
the pigskin over the remaining four white lines intervening between it
and the Greenburg goal At last Ill tell you Harry he said Ive
always felt a sort of interest in Kendall ever since he butted into the
room one night with the calm announcement to Dan that hed like to
join the football team Towne put him up to it you know

I hear Towne isnt coming back this year interpolated Harry

You cant make me feel bad that way replied Gerald Well I
really meant to cultivate Kendall after that but I got busy with the
crosscountry work and one thing and another and didnt see much of
him Ned Tooker sort of took him up though and he seemed in pretty
good hands Then came that affair of the field goal and the school
made a hero of him or would have had he let them Dan was interested
in Kendall too and we got him over to the room once or twice but he
seemed afraid of coming when he wasnt wanted and we sort of gave him
up after awhile

But Dan was a great believer in Kendall Said he was the most
natural football player he had ever seen And he also saidGerald
lowered his voicethat unless something happened like Kendall
getting hurt or leaving school he would be captain before he got
through here

Harry whistled softly but expressively

And you know Dan doesnt make mistakes added Gerald his fondness
for his friend sounding in his voice

Looks as if hed made one this time though doesnt it asked Harry
with a smile

Why

Why Well look Harry nodded to where Kendall was racing up the
field after a punt Hes only first sub now and next year is his last
isnt it

Yes And thats why weve got to get busy

Eh Who Get busy doing what

Proving that Dan wasnt mistaken replied Gerald quietly If
Kendalls going to have the captaincy before he leaves here then next
years his last chance And that means that hes got to win it this
Fall

Yes but what did you mean when you said wed got to get busy

Just that answered Gerald with a smile Dan said Kendall would be
captain He expects him to be and wants him to be Well you know Im
pretty fond of old Dan and so its up to me to see that things happen
the way he wants them to

But what the dickens can you do gasped Harry

I dont quite know yet But you can see what I have done Ive brought
Kendall over to my room where he will meet a lot of fellows he ought
to know I want him to get close to the other fellows on the team
for one thing for its those fellows who will elect the captain next
month Of course its up to him to make good on the gridiron and I
think he will He will if I can make him anyway

Butbut look here Geraldthatthats rank politics

No it isnt replied Gerald shaking his head gently Its
politics but it isnt rank It amounts to this Harry Kendall hasnt
the push to get himself elected captain if left to his own efforts But
theres no reason why he shouldnt be captain if hes wanted

But he wont be

Not if hes left to himself but I intend to see that he is wanted
What I am conducting is a quiet campaign in the interests of Kendall
Burtis If he does his part youll find when it comes time to elect a
captain for next year that theyll be crying for Kendall

Harry viewed the other in rapt and admiring awe for a moment Then
doubtfully But it doesnt seem to me that hes got it in him to be a
good captain Gerald Hehe isnt a leader I dont say he cant play
football for I think he can although even thats got to be proved a
bit more hasnt it Butwell it takes certain qualities to be a good
captain

What are they

Eh Oh I dont know Pluck of course and brains andand executive
ability

Whatever that is laughed Gerald Well you cant say Kendall hasnt
pluck after the way he went overboard the other day without being able
to swim a stroke And as for brains well you think a minute

Harry nodded Yes hes got a good thinker I guess

And he can be wonderfully cool in an emergency continued Gerald

How do you know that

By the way he stepped out on the field last year at the eleventh hour
grabbed off the grand stand in a pair of long trousers and hustled
into a sweater and stood there and kicked that goal with the whole
Broadwood team trying to get through and kill him

Yyes but

As for the other thing what you call executive ability and what the
rest of us who havent your visiting acquaintance with fine English
call leadership why no he hasnt displayed any of that yet He
hasnt had a chance I guess Thats something well have to develop in
him or at least bring out And hes discouragingly shy He will have
to get over some of that I dont expect to make him popular in the
general meaning of the word That isnt necessary I dont think you
can call Charlie Merriwell a very popular chap

He isnt and it remains to be seen what sort of a captain he will
make Simms ought to have had it

Yes Simms is popular but he didnt get the captaincy I know of at
least two fellows on the team who dont really like Merriwell and who
cast their votes for him because they knew he could play football and
believed hed make a good captain and because they respected him See
Well I mean to have Kendall prove that he can play football show that
he can lead and win the respect of the fellows

Gee youve got a job Sounds like a confidence game to me
too Gerald Hanged if you arent deliberately setting to work
totowhats that wordto foist a captain on the school that they
dont even know

But they will know him before the time comes replied Gerald
confidently As for foistinghe shrugged his shouldersits a fine
old word Harry but its in wrong Dan has chosen Kendall for next
years captain Dan knows Kendall shall be captain There it is in a
nutshell

Youve certainly got plenty of cheek laughed Harry And you can bet
Ill be watching things with rapt attention Gerald I wish you luck
and Kendall too but Im very much afraid youll be disappointed

Perhaps If we are well stand it Theres one thing you seem to miss
though You talk about standing by and watching things I have tried to
convey the idea that you were in on the campaign Harry

Me What the dickens can I do

I dont know yet I think you can be useful however Perhaps Ill
make you head of the publicity department Anyhow I want your help If
I hadnt I wouldnt have told you all this Because its got to be kept
a secret from everyone Harry and especially Kendall

What Isnt he to know

Not a word of it

Then I dont see how you can expect him toto do things to get next
to the fellows to

Dont you see that if we told him hed back out right now He hasnt
any more idea of getting the captaincy that he has ofof flying And
even if he agreed to it hed be so selfconscious all the time that
hed make a horrible mess of it No you and I and maybe another chap
before were through must keep this to ourselves No one must even
guess that were booming Kendall

Sounds difficult Harry objected

Not very Theres no reason why anyone should suspect that we are
doing it is there Just now Kendall Burtis is about the last fellow
anyone would think of as next years captain isnt he

He certainly is agreed Harry with conviction

Then why should anyone suspect that were pushing him for it
Diplomacy Harry diplomacy Also secrecy

Two orders of each said Harry Well it sounds sort of crazy to me
but Ill take a chance with you And now as the practice has been over
for some five minutes and as were about the only fellows in sight Id
like to move along Even politicians have to eat Gerald




CHAPTER VIII

COTTON MAKES A WAGER


I often wonder what Kendalls sensations would have been had he learned
of the plot to make him football captain Disbelief first of all I
fancy and then wonder and alarm and finally absolute stupefaction
But he never did learn never so much as suspected what was going on
There was no reason why he should Number  Clarke had long been a
popular place of gathering as Kendall who had spent a year in the
same corridor well knew and if it sometimes seemed to him that the
room was rapidly degenerating into a club it never occurred to him that
he had anything to do with it He often wished that Gerald was less
popular for the gatherings in Number  often seriously interfered
with his studying All kinds of fellows came and went and Kendall met
them all sooner or later Had he given the matter special thought he
might have remarked on the fact that while the visitors represented
about every interest in school they were all fellows worth knowing
fellows who had made good in one way or another fellows whose words
carried weight and who held influence They were by no means all
football chaps nor even all athletic chaps What Harry Merrow called
the HighBrow Element was well represented At one time or another in
that month of October Gerald managed to attract to his room and always
in the most natural and casual way about all the prominent fellows in
Yardley And Kendall thought it was very nice and enjoyed meeting the
visitors and having no ax to grind was diffidently polite and did
more listening than talking One evening after Merriwell and Simms of
the football team and one or two others had been in and gone again
Gerald took Kendall goodnaturedly to task

Look here Kendall he said as they were getting ready for bed
its a fine thing to be modest and all that but as the negro said
it dont get you nothin Why dont you talk a little more

Why II guess I dont think of anything to say Gerald

Rot You talk more sense than most fellows when you do talk Im not
suggesting that you jabber just to make a noise but youre overdoing
the wise owl act old man Fellows may get it into their heads that you
dont approve of their statements and remarks you see Loosen up now
and then Kendall loosen up

There was no more said but the suggestion bore fruit Kendall really
made an effort on the next occasion He wasnt exactly chatty but he
hazarded an opinion now and then and was both surprised and flattered
to find that what he said was listened to with at least a show of
interest A chap who doesnt talk often is pretty certain of a hearing
when he does say anything and as Kendall seldom spoke unless he had a
remark of some value to offer he soon became certain of his audience
But all this took time and in the meanwhile life was pretty busy with
him and he had far more important affairs to think of than polite
conversation in Number 

St Johns School came and departed with trailing banners Kendall
played through two periods of that game and acquitted himself with
honor Jennings Academy proved a harder conundrum for the wearers
of the Yardley blue Jennings was a new opponent having been given
a place on the schedule that Fall for the first time vice Carrels
School Jennings had Yardley pretty well scared for three periods
during which she ran up ten points to the Blues five But in the final
ten minutes Yardley buckled down and hammered her way almost the length
of the field and sent Simms dodging and twisting across the line for
another score Luckily Fales barely managed to place the pigskin over
the bars in the tryatgoal and Yardley nosed out of the fray victor
by one point It was by this time well past the middle of October and
the remaining contests with Porter Institute Forest Hill Nordham
and Broadwood were all of the major variety Yardley was to go away
from home for the Porter game and this year it was Broadwoods turn
to entertain her rival but the other two games were to be contested
on the Yardley field The Nordham game for the reason that Nordham
had trounced the Blue the preceding Fall was looked forward to with
unusual interest and a grim determination to wreak revenge Not that
Coach Payson meant to endanger his chances of defeating Broadwood the
week afterward or that any of the fellows wanted him to However if
it was in any way possible to square accounts with Nordham without
overexerting or injuring her players Yardley meant to do it

Football practice was no longer a romp although Coach Payson never
allowed the work to become so severe as to be distasteful Many a day
the players First Team Second Team and substitutes trailed back up
the hill to the gymnasium tired in every muscle and almost ready for
mutiny But always by the time they had had supper the bruises were
forgotten the muscles had stopped aching and their thoughts were set
eagerly on the morrows practice Of course there were the usual
minor injuries to contend with during the early season the usual
cases of overtraining but no serious setback to the progress of the
team occurred That progress was slow and steady More time than usual
had been given this year to the fundamentals It was not until after
the Jennings game that tackling the dummy ceased to be a part of the
afternoon programme Even then the stuffed figure continued to swing
and dance between the uprights and was occasionally visited by some
player who had failed to grasp the knack of stopping the runner The
kickers Kendall amongst them held a halfhour of practice each day
Simms the quarter was a fairly proficient dropkicker but had never
showed much punting ability and Payson meant he should learn the art
Graduation had deprived the team of one or two fair punters and it
was necessary to replace them The material was not very promising at
the beginning of the season if we except Kendall Kendall had proved
himself a born kicker but no coach wants to depend on one man for
the whole season So Fales and Crandall and Plant were added to the
kicking staff and by the middle of the season Fales had become a
dropkicker of some ability and Plant was getting off punts of forty
and fortyfive yards But Kendall still held his superiority in both
lines

It was the Monday after the Jennings game that Kendall ceased being
a substitute and took Fayettes place at right halfback The change
surprised no one not even Fayette I think for the school had all
the Fall expected Kendall to make the team and had only wondered why
Payson had not placed him before A player with Kendalls ability to
punt dropkick or placekick deserved a position on the team even if
his football ability ended there But Kendalls didnt and he proved
it time and again as the season wore on He was a daring runner with
the ball a brilliant groundgainer who dodged and whirled through a
broken field like a small cyclone and was as difficult to seize and
stop He was so dependable in fact that when the First Team was in
a tight place one was likely to hear murmurs along the sidelines of
Why dont they give it to Burtis But Kendall had his limitations
too for at lineplunging he failed to gain as did either Marion or
Crandall He was lighter than those players and could not hit the line
as hard But if the opening was there Kendall could knife himself
through as well as anyone and once going he was harder to stop than
the big Marion

But if the Jennings contest decided favorably the fortunes of
Kendall it also brought disaster to the ambitions of another of our
acquaintances Charles Cotton was dropped on that Monday Others went
with him in that final cut and I doubt if any deserved banishment more
than Cotton and Im sure none took it less gracefully Cottons soul
was filled with bitterness and wrath and his speech with condemnation

Since that first unsuccessful visit to Number  Cotton had called
many times Gerald bore with him for the sake of Kendall and Kendall
secretly weary to death of him and disliking him more and more each
time tried his best to blame himself for the distaste he felt for
Cotton and for fear he was doing that youth an injustice was as nice
as pie to him Cotton always seemed to know when Captain Merriwell or
other influential football fellows were in Number  and timed his
visits by such knowledge He swiped frankly and assiduously He tried
his hardest to make a hit with Merriwell but only succeeded in making
the captain loathe the sight of him He was boastful sarcastic and far
from kindhearted but for a while he managed to make even Merriwell
and in a lesser degree Gerald believe in his football prowess He
never hesitated to praise himself and his playing and if one does
that often enough and with sufficient enthusiasm one will impress the
audience Unfortunately however Cotton was unable to prove on the
gridiron what he proclaimed in the dormitory and as elocution doesnt
win football games Cottons career came to an end He selected the
evening of the day of his demise to call on Kendall Perhaps he hoped
to find Merriwell there and to make a plea for reinstatement If so he
was disappointed for only Gerald and Kendall were in the room when he
made his appearance

Well I see you struck it Burtis he announced after greetings were
over Very glad Im sure You can play all around Fayette

Thanks murmured Kendall It was just because I am a bit handier at
kicking than Fayette is that they gave me his place He may have me out
again before the big game

Pshaw dont you worry Payson loves you Merriwell does too youre
popular That makes a difference

Just what do you mean by that asked Gerald with a frown

Oh you know well enough what I mean A fellow hasnt much show here
to make anything unless hes got plenty of friends Look at me I can
play end as well as Fox can better for that matter but I get pitched
out and he stays in Fox has been here two years and has a pull Im a
new fellow and havent Thats all

If you can play better than Fox exclaimed Gerald impatiently why
the dickens dont you

I have All the Fall Ask any one

I dont need to Ive watched practice myself almost every day until a
week ago and Ill tell you frankly Cotton you never showed anything
when I was looking

I didnt know you considered yourself an authority on football
Pennimore I thought running was your specialty

It is but Ive played some football and Ive seen a heap of it and
if you want my opinion Ill tell you plainly that you play the game
about as well as a piece of cheese I dont want to hurt your feelings
Cotton but theres no sense in making charges of favoritism here In
this school a fellow wins on his merits and when youve been here
longer youll realize it

Thats your opinion growled Cotton Youve always had everything
you wanted and you think youve earned it all Ill bet you that if
you hadnt known lots of the fellows who give out favors youd be just
where you were when you came

Kendall who had been listening with an anxious countenance attempted
the rle of peacemaker Well youve got another year yet Cotton I
wouldnt feel badly about it After all

Badly Oh Im not breaking my heart replied Cotton with a sneer
Its no great honor to win your place by a pull Besides that team
will be beaten to a froth this year Why Broadwood will put it all
over them You wait and see

Youre one of the sort who doesnt want to play on the losing side
are you asked Gerald disdainfully Then I guess the teams well off
without you Cotton

Cotton turned toward Gerald with an angry light in his pale eyes but
whatever the words were that sprang to his lips they never got past
His reply to the taunt was so gentle that both Gerald and Kendall
stared in surprise I can take a licking as well as the next fellow
said Cotton quietly But I do think its a shame to keep good players
off the team and get beaten for it by Broadwood

The teams no worse than last years replied Gerald regaining his
good nature and that was good enough to lick old Broadwood my
friend

Yes by a goal from the field Broadwood had you beaten before that

Whats the odds A field goal is a field goal and we won And well
do it again this year

Bet you dont

Bet we do That is I might bet if betting was allowed continued
Gerald with a chuckle

Well what will you bet Cotton demanded eagerly

Not allowed responded Gerald Betting is barred

You know youd lose taunted the other

Geralds eyes snapped Wait a bit Mr Cotton Seems to me you are
pretty certain considering that the game is a month away

I am certain Broadwood will make your team

Why mine Why not ours

Well our team then Broadwood will make it look likelike a bunch
of hasbeens

May I ask on what you base your judgment asked Gerald

On lots of things On the players and the coaching system

You dont approve of our coaching system

I certainly dont Payson works the fellows like a lot of dray horses
for one thing And hes oldfashioned too He sticks to old formations
and plays that were worn out when Walter Camp was a baby And look at
the way he runs practice Every fellow doing about what he likes When
does he begin to teach teamplay Id like to know In Saturdays game
there was about as much cordinationGerald blinkedas there is in
a pack of hens

You mean a swarm of hens corrected Gerald gently Well all that
may be true I wish anyway youd mention it to Payson he ought to
be warned Butbut my caustic and critical friend well send
Broadwood home with its tail between its legs

Maybe but you dont believe it hard enough to bet anything on it

Merely because betting is not allowed and because I have been taught
besides that it isnt nice Still Gerald paused and considered
Still we might perhaps come to an agreement that woulderadd a
personal interest to the outcome of the game Let me see Cotton Ill
tell you Gerald viewed him in mild triumph If Broadwood wins Ill
invite you to spend Christmas recess with me in New York and give you
a good time all differences and animosities forgotten On the other
hand if Broadwood is defeated you willwhat the dickens will you
do Cotton opened his mouth to speak but Gerald went on I have it
If Yardley wins you will stand on the steps of Oxford at five oclock
give a cheer for Yardley and proclaim a certain passage from a play of
one William Shakespeare which I will indicate when the time comes

Thats silly growled Cotton

Maybe whats the difference Do you agree

Yes If Broadwood wins youre to give me a week at your place in New
York at Christmas

Ten days if you like

And if Broadwood loses I am to stand in front of Oxford Hall and cheer
for Yardley and say something out of Shakespeare

At five oclock on the day of the game And youre to cheer and speak
loud enough to be hearderat the farthest edge of the stupendous
throng

Its a bargain agreed Cotton with a grin I expect to have a
pretty good time at recess Much obliged Now Ill be going Im sort
of sorry for you though Pennimore

So shall I be if I lose laughed Gerald as Cottons footsteps died
away down the hall

What is it you want him to repeat asked Kendall

If he loses Why nothing but that famous passage from Mr Shakespeares
Much Ado About Nothing You remember the words of our old friend
Dogberry Masters remember that I am an ass though it be not written
down yet forget not that I am an ass




CHAPTER IX

HARRY SCENTS A MYSTERY


Life wasnt all football however There was a lot of studying to
attend to Kendall was taking five courses in preparation for that
college he might never reach Latin Greek mathematics English and
German These made up a total of twentytwo hours a week French
physics and chemistry he was leaving to his senior year Luckily
Kendall had the valuable gift of application and application might
also be called the royal road to results Certainly an ounce of it
is better than a pound of labor Kendall was doing well in all his
courses He was fond of languages and learned easily German however
presenting a rather more difficult road than Greek or Latin It was
in mathematics that he had to work hardest There are some who never
manage to get themselves in sympathy with that science and Kendall
was one of these Geometry was his bugbear that year But with the
scholarship beckoning he worked as hard as he knew how and usually
secured creditable marks Although he had only three hours of English
that course required a good deal of outside reading just now they
were digging at Milton with Shakespeare looming ahead and there
were weekly compositions to be written and of course one never
quite got away from rhetoric So Kendall had his hands full and there
were times when it seemed to him that it would be the part of wisdom
to give up football and devote all his thought and time to digging
for that scholarship He didnt however although he became panicky
pretty often and assured himself discouragedly that he hadnt the
ghost of a show of winning even a Sidney The panicky moments became
more frequent as the Broadwood game drew near and as football made
greater and greater demands on his time and thought But when the
awards were made at the end of the term Kendall found that his fears
had been groundless for he won the Gordon Scholarship after all And
the pleasure he experienced in writing the news to his father more than
made up for all the labor he had gone through

Studying in his room in the evening wasnt a very great success
for although the study hour was more or less strictly observed
the gatherings there continued and it was difficult to get the
mind settled on geometry or German Latin or Greek when you had been
listening for an hour to a discussion of the afternoons practice
Gerald in his last year had less to do than Kendall He was taking
but four courses found them easy and so had to study but little
Kendall made use of the hours when he had no recitations to retire to
the library in Oxford and most of his studying was done there

And aside from football there were other athletic interests demanding
the attention of the school The crosscountry candidates were training
five days a week The golf team was preparing for the match with
Broadwood There was a Fall Handicap Tournament going on at the tennis
courts Even the baseball diamonds were occupied in fair weather
Boys who found no appeal in any of these pursuits took to the water
and as long as the Winter held off the river was dotted with canoes
and skiffs pairoars and tubs And yet back of all this one event
loomed fatefully growing each day larger and more portentous That
was the Big Game All the athletic industries culminated with the
Broadwood contest the eighteenth of November marked the end of the
Autumn season and fellows had a way of making promises to themselves
like this After the Broadwood game Ill buckle down and get caught
up with Latin or When the Broadwood games over Ill have more
time for study There was a subconscious spirit of nervous unrest
pervading the school that grew as the days went by After the eleven
had journeyed away and returned with the scalp of Porter Institute the
season settled into its final stride and only two games intervened
before the great test

Yardley found Porter easy and rolled up twentyfour points against
her opponent meanwhile denying Porter the consolation of a single
score The school declared that the team had found itself and that
the rest was easy More knowing ones taking Porters weakness into
consideration found cause for doubts and criticisms Twice Yardley had
had the ball within Porters tenyard line and had failed to score
There had been four bad fumbles The team was still weak on offense
If Broadwood was to be beaten the Blue must improve vastly in the next
three weeks Thus the knowing ones What Coach Payson thought no one
knew

In the meantime Geralds campaign went forward and bore results
Kendall made friends Nowadays to walk from his room in Clarke to
a recitation room in Oxford entailed more greetings than last year
he would have been called on to accord in a month He was really
surprised to find how many fellows he knew well enough to stop and talk
to how many others demanded recognition a word a nod or a wave of
the hand Of course among the younger boys he was a hero second only
to Captain Merriwell himself and the Preparatory Class youth who won
a word from Kendall hurried off to tell the rest of the inhabitants of
Merle of the talk he had had with Burtis describing just how Kendall
had looked and just what he had said and Im afraid enlarging
a little on the incident But thats a weakness not confined to
Preparatory Class boys Had you asked some of Kendalls fellow members
of the team why they had taken a liking to him it is probable that they
would each have said about the same thinghad they deigned to answer
such a question at all Burtis they would have said Oh I dont
know Hes a good sort dont you think Awfully quiet of course but
has a lot of horse sense Doesnt butt in either Not much on the
handsome but sort of nice looking too somehow Doesnt have much to
say about what he has done or is going to do or can do just goes ahead
and does it Awfully square sort Id say Besides he certainly can
play football

Gerald was pretty busy nowadays with the CrossCountry Team He was
captain of it and about the best performer And so Kendall saw less
of him than during the first of the term But they usually spent the
evenings together Harry Merrow also a member of the CrossCountry
squad was very likely to turn up at Number  after supper and
Kendall had grown to like him very much There had been another jaunt
on The Dart since the day they had been lost in the fog but the
second voyage had been an affair without incident Kendall had not
yet become a proficient swimmer principally because he had had but
three lessons in the art It was very hard to find time for anything
just now But he had managed thirty strokes on the last occasion and
had swallowed only about three quarts of the Wissining River Gerald
and Harry had assured him that he had done excellently and Kendall
promised himself that when Spring came he would complete his education

Another fairly frequent visitor to Number  was The Duke The Duke had
a way of knocking subduedly and entering on tiptoe throwing fearful
glances behind him and subsiding into a chair with a long sigh of
relief

Ha he would whisper hoarsely Again I have thrown him off the
track Ah the peace and quiet of this refuse Perhaps it isnt
necessary to explain that in The Dukes language refuse meant
refuge He always pretended that Cotton was dogging his footsteps
and that it was only by extraordinary stealth and cunning that he could
escape his roommate Once or twice it happened that Cotton followed him
later and on those occasions The Duke would throw up his hands roll
his eyes and spend the rest of the time of his visit sitting silent
and staring at Cotton as though hypnotized

Cotton still insisted that he had been badly used by coach and captain
and still predicted utter annihilation for the forces of Yardley
Geralds wager soon became known of and occasioned a lot of merriment
The Duke pretended to beor perhaps really wasmuch concerned My
word Gerald suppose we really did get licked Have you paused to
consider the fate you haveerinvited Think of having Cotton on your
hands every hour for a week or ten days Breakfast luncheon dinner
Gerald No time off for recitations Oh woe is you

Some of the other fellows too tried to alarm Gerald declaring that
they wouldnt be a bit surprised if Broadwood won this year Then they
drew graphic word pictures of Gerald towing Charles Cotton around New
York in Christmas recess Whatever you do Gerald begged Bert
Simms dont take him to the Eden Musee When you went out youd get
arrested for attempting to steal one of the wax figures

From all of which it will be seen that Mr Cotton had unfortunately
not ingratiated himself to any extent with the habitus of Number 
One evening about midway between the Porter and Forest Hill games the
room was pretty well filled Merriwell and Simms and Girard of the
football element were present and George Kirk captain of the golf
team had dropped in These with Gerald and Kendall pretty well taxed
the seating accommodations Naturally the three subjects uppermost were
football crosscountry running and golf Kirk had been bewailing
the loss to the golf team of Ned Tooker last years captain and star
player and had expressed himself as very doubtful of the outcome of
the match to be played at Broadwood the following Saturday

Burtis I thought you were going to play golf this year said Kirk

I am I think after the Broadwood game answered Kendall I like it
firstrate Kirk but there isnt much time for it now you know

I suppose not Maybe youll get in shape to play with us in the Spring
matches though Its the hardest thing to get fellows to take an
interest in golf here

Everyone wants to play football in the Fall and baseball in Spring
said Gerald You cant get them to think of anything else barring
track sports Weve had a dickens of a time this year getting enough
fellows together to make up the CrossCountry Team

I thought you had lots of candidates said Charles Merriwell a
goodlooking darkhaired fellow of nineteen Anyhow youre going to
win arent you

Oh I suppose well win all right enough but if we do it will be
because Broadwoods weak this year Our team doesnt begin to compare
with last seasons

Thats what they all say scoffed big Girard the center You hear
that every year Nothing ever compares with what we had last year Its
rot

Not always replied Bert Simms Our team isnt as good as last
years and you know it Pete

Whats the matter with it

Too light for one thing Broadwoods got the heaviest team she ever
put on the field Bet you shell outweigh us four pounds to a man

Oh piffle Look at OBrien their center hes a mite

Well hes the only mite theyve got Pete As for the backfield
theyre tons heavier than we are

Then well make up for it by getting the jump on em said Girard
Weight isnt everything

Nice of you to say so murmured Simms causing chuckles of
amusement from the others Girard reached out with a big foot and
hooking it around a leg of Simms chair brought that youth to the
floor

Berts right though declared Merriwell when order had been
restored and well find when Payson shows his new plays that were in
for a kicking game with most of our gains on wide runs Youll be busy
that day Burtis

At that moment there was a rap at the door and The Duke entered hands
in pockets whistling his eyes roaming the ceiling elaborately
careless He had an old felt hat on the back of his head his coat was
tightly buttoned and the collar was turned up and a false mustache
fiercely red hovered uncertainly under his nose A burst of laughter
greeted him Once inside the room however his demeanor changed
Turning swiftly he threw himself against the door and as it crashed
shut quickly turned the key and leaned there breathing heavily his
eyes darting about with a haunted and terrified glare

What is it asked Merriwell Sherlock Holmes

Old Sleuth suggested Gerald How did you cut your lip Duke

Without replying The Duke leaned down and pressed an ear against
the keyhole Then apparently satisfied he unlocked the door and
dramatically removed hat and mustache

Aha he exclaimed hoarsely foiled again

Bet you he will be along inside five minutes laughed Gerald Sit on
the bed Duke and try to look like a pillow Maybe he wont recognize
you

The Duke followed the first part of the suggestion but refused to
disguise himself as a pillow even when Simms suggested that that
shouldnt be a difficult stunt for anyone as featherbrained as The
Duke

Dont trifle with me hissed The Duke Im a deresperate man

Whered you get the red mustache asked Girard Lets see it

Bought in the village replied The Duke as he tossed it over It
makes a perfect disguise doesnt it Im going to wear it to history
recitation tomorrow so Collins wont know me and wont ask for my
digest which I have forgotten to prepare

I stump you to said Simms If you will But the rest was lost
in the laughter caused by Girards appearance with the mustache on
After that they all had to try it and just as it finally got around to
Kendall there was another knock on the door

Ha muttered The Duke Tis he I am discovered But I shall sell my
life dearly

There was a moment of silence as the door swung slowly open and then
as Cotton walked in with fine dignity a howl of laughter went up Only
The Duke remained grave Holding a pillow in front of him he gazed
fiercely over the top of it muttering and hissing Cotton paused in
surprise Simms was rolling on the bed in convulsions and Girard was
sprawled back in his chair holding his sides Cotton viewed the scene
at first with bewilderment and then with distaste A flush crept into
his cheeks as he closed the door behind him

Hello he said stiffly whats the joke you fellows

Kendall was the first to recover Oh just some of Wellingtons
nonsense he replied hastily Sit down Cotton

Yyes gurgled Gerald ssit down somewhere if you can find room
Sit on the bed there next to The Duke

The Duke lowered the pillow his gaze fixed on Cotton with fearful
intensity Then as the latter passed around the table to reach the
bed The Duke seized the false mustache from Kendall clapped it to his
face and confronted Cotton superbly

Aha James Mortimer he drawled stroking one end of the brilliant
mustache So we meet again do we What have you done with the
cheild

Cotton who had suspected himself to be in some way the subject of the
laughter that had greeted him was restored to equanimity He joined in
the laughter that followed and made himself comfortable on the bed

Whered you get that thing he asked Lets see how Id look in it
Duke

Heaven forfend replied The Duke vehemently as he thrust it into his
pocket It wouldnt become you Charles it really wouldnt

Cotton smiled in the manner of one humoring a child or harmless lunatic
and turned to Merriwell Hows the team getting on he asked

Fair thanks replied the captain without enthusiasm

Going to win on Saturday

Hope to

Youll have to brace up your line then I was reading today that
Forest Hill has a wonderful attack this year

What sort of an attack asked The Duke interestedly Not mumps I
hope

Shes got most of her last years team hasnt she asked Kendall
hurriedly

Blessed if I know answered Merriwell I guess Payson isnt much
worried about it though I do hope well trim Nordham though
fellows

Oh well run away with her this year asserted Girard

There was another knock on the door

Well were some popular tonight said Gerald Come in

It was Harry Merrow Hello everybody he greeted What is this A
mass meeting Just then his gaze fell on Cotton and his eyes narrowed
suddenly and for some time after he had perched himself beside Gerald
on the latters bed he continued to observe Cotton curiously across
the room The conversation went on for a minute or two Then Harry
whispered to Gerald and the latter broke in with

Cotton I believe you havent met Merrow Hes in your class by the
way Sorry I thought you knew each other

Harry reached over Girards head and shook hands with Cotton

Glad to know you he said Weve met before though havent we

I dont think so replied Cotton Ive only been here this Fall

I mean before that said Harry Your face seems very familiar

How about his manner asked The Duke innocently Cotton flushed as he
took his seat again

Thats an old joke he said contemptuously

How dear to my heart are the jokes of my childhood chanted The Duke
When fond recollection presents them to view

Harry looking polite and incredulous sat down again but every now
and then he shot a puzzled glance at Cotton The latter however
appeared to have forgotten Harrys existence after the introduction and
steadily kept his eyes away from that youth Soon after Merriwell and
Girard took their departure followed later by Kirk and Simms Cotton
stayed on until at last The Duke giving Gerald a look of despair said
good night Cotton left with him and as soon as the door was shut
Harry broke out

Id give a thousand dollars to know where Ive seen that fellow he
declared

Thats a lot of money yawned Gerald

Not if you say it quick But honest fellows that chap bothers me
I know Ive met him before and talked with him but I cant imagine
where it could have been You remember Gerald that day at practice I
told you he looked familiar Well I was right Therestheres some
mystery about Cotton

Oh he probably looks like someone else said Gerald soothingly
Although to be strictly truthful Harry I never saw anyone who
looked just like him

He knew tonight that I recognized him mused Harry and he wouldnt
look at me once Well He moved toward the door I mean to find out
Good night fellows




CHAPTER X

THE SPY


However Harry did not at once borrow The Dukes red mustache and go
sleuthing As curious as he was about Cotton he was much too busy
these days to play detective for although he was pretty certain of
winning the crosscountry race from Broadwood Gerald wasnt taking any
chances and the way he and Andy Ryan kept the team on the go was a
caution

The race was to be held as usual on the morning of the day of the
football game between the rivals and over a course which might be
called neutral lying as it did practically halfway between the two
schools Broadwood Academy was situated some four miles from Yardley
on the other side of Greenburg and so far inland that at Yardley
they spoke of it humorously as a freshwater college Broadwood was
slightly smaller than Yardley in point of enrollment but for all of
that was an ideal rival since she fought hard in every competition
and obligingly went down in defeat oftener than she triumphed There
was no student now in Yardley who could recall a Broadwood victory on
the gridiron although there had been some heartbreaking struggles and
alarmingly close scores In baseball Broadwood was not so obliging
although since John Paysons advent at Yardley she had experienced
more defeats than victories The rivalry between the two preparatory
institutions both good ones was healthy Yardley fellows simulated
a contempt for the wearers of the Green that they really didnt feel
and Broadwood pretended similar sentiments toward the Blue In reality
however each school entertained a deepseated respect for the other
While Yardley graduates were likely to go up to Yale to complete their
education Broadwood traditions favored Princeton

But while Broadwood usually excelled at hockey garnered a full share
of the track and field honors proved herself as good as her rival at
baseball and accepted defeat on the gridiron only after the gamest
battles she was weak at crosscountry running and had been beaten each
of the few times that she had met Yardley Gerald who would have liked
to complete his hillanddale career and celebrate his year as captain
with a hardfought victory lamented Broadwoods weakness this year

I wish we might give them a handicap he confided to Harry that
Saturday morning as they went back to the gymnasium after a twomile
jaunt It was the day of the Forest Hill game and partly because it
seemed fair to let the crosscountry runners witness the afternoon
contest and partly because it was advisable to accustom the team to
morning work since the race was to be run in the forenoon todays
work had started at tenthirty Gerald seemed as fresh as when he had
started out and save for the disks of red which had not yet faded
from his cheeks one would never have suspected that he had led nine
others over approximately two miles of the hardest sort of going Harry
Merrow however showed the pace He had managed to finish fourth and
was rather proud of himself although when Gerald had clapped him
on the back at the finish and congratulated him he had only smiled
depreciatingly

We might give them a quartermile start proposed Harry with a
laugh in response to Geralds remark But I dont see why youre so
anxious to get beaten Gerald

Im not but Id like to have the race a really close one As it is
were just as likely as not to finish the first four men ahead of
them Im pretty certain we will if you run as well as you did today

I ought to do three or four minutes better on the eighteenth said
Harry How far behind you was I today

About six minutes And I did as well within three minutes as I ever
did said Gerald

Harry thought that over for a minute as they climbed the footpath that
affords a short cut to the gymnasium from the village road and before
he had succeeded in figuring out what their relative positions would
probably be in the race Gerald introduced a change of subject

How do you think the campaign is going Harry he asked

Campaign Oh you mean Kendalls Why pretty well I think But I
hear that theres a good deal of talk of making Crandall captain Hes
pretty popular you know And a good player too

That so I hadnt heard it Well Howards a fine chap and if our
candidate loses he ought to make a good captain Have you heard talk of
any other fellows for captain

No I guess not Fales would take it if he could get it So would two
or three others Pete Girard for one

Hed be a wonder laughed Gerald No I guess it will be up to
either Howard Crandall or Kendall You havent heard Kendalls name
mentioned have you

For the captaincy No but I dont hear much of the talk But Kendall
has certainly made good so far hasnt he I mean with the fellows
They all seem to like him If hed get busy and pull off some brilliant
stunt this afternoon or next week or win the Broadwood game with a
fieldgoal I guess he could have the captaincy eh

I think so Unfortunately we cant advise him to get off any
gallery plays He wouldnt if we did Besides a fellow cant make
opportunities All he can do is to grab them when they come I hope
though that Kendall will put up a good game today Its time the
fellows began to consider him as a possibility If they dont well
have to drop a hint pretty soon

Youre a regular old politician laughed Harry

Say diplomat said Gerald It sounds more respectable

Schemer is more like it responded Harry as they entered the
gymnasium Something tells me that a shower is going to feel mighty
good

Half an hour later when they rounded the front of Oxford the Golf
Team was just setting off for Broadwood after an early dinner in a
threeseated carriage George Kirk waved to them and then spoke to the
driver and the carriage stopped Kirk leaned out and called to Gerald

Say Gerald do something for me Find The Duke hes at the
telephone I think and tell him never mind about New York Ill call
up this evening

Never mind about New York youll call up this evening All right
George Ill tell him Good luck Go to it and eat em alive

Kirk nodded and waved and the carriage went on down the drive

I suppose mused Harry as he followed Gerald back to Oxford that
Kirk is just as much excited about his old golf match as you and I will
be about the race two weeks from now Funny isnt it

Funny repeated Gerald as he ran up the steps Why

Oh funny to think it matters who wins a golf match

Its evident youre not a golfer laughed Gerald Ill bet that if
Georges outfit gets licked this afternoon he will be like a bear with
a sore head Theres The Duke in the booth

The longdistance booth was halfway down the main corridor of Oxford
and although it was rather dim they could descry a figure behind the
glass It was dinner hour and Oxford was otherwise quite deserted
Gerald walked down the corridor Harry sauntering behind

Hi Duke Kirk says never mind about New York shouted Gerald

The Duke looked very angry and redfaced behind the window as Gerald
drew near and was gesticulating wildly He was also saying things but
what they were Gerald was still too far away to hear

The Dukes having a fit Harry he announced interestedly Come and
watch him

 Door  lemme out

Whats he saying asked Harry grinning as he realized The Dukes
dilemma Gerald shook his head

Cant understand him Can you Seems quite worked up about something
though

Lemme out Dont be a fool Cant you see this blamed doors stuck
And The Duke mouthed and grimaced behind the glass

Gerald and Harry maintaining a respectful distance viewed him
gravely

Cant get his number I suppose said Harry sympathetically

Maybe hes got hold of a live wire somehow Anything wrong Duke

You open this door Gerald Im suffocating in here

He wants you to open the door explained Harry brightly But do you
think youd better He looks a bit dangerous doesnt he

Yyes responded Gerald doubtfully Perhaps wed better have help in
case he gets

But there was such a rattling of the door such an assault on the side
of the booth that Geralds words were drowned I do hope hes hung
up the receiver so that the operator cant hear him said Harry It
might give the school a bad name

Gerald at last taking pity on the prisoner turned the door knob and
The Duke stumbled out angry of countenance and incoherent of speech

Wish youd get yourself locked up in that blamed thing he sputtered
and see how you like it Its ninetyeight in there and you cant
breathe Why didnt you open that door before Wanted to be smart I
suppose

Whats the matter with the door asked Harry

Its crazy I guess You cant open it from inside to save your life
It ought to be fixed

Oh I guess you didnt go at it right said Harry soothingly Let me
try it

So Harry stepped into the booth and closed the door behind him The
Dukes expression of wrath changing slowly to a wicked grin Harry
turned the knob inside and pushed The door remained firm Then he
tried again and with no better success The Duke was thoroughly
enjoying himself now applauding and encouraging Gerald observed
smilingly At last Harry gave it up

Cant be did he announced from within in a smothered voice Open
her up Gerald

Gerald looked inquiringly at The Duke and The Duke gazed questioningly
at Gerald Strange observed the latter that you cant hear what he
says Perhaps if he put his mouth to the keyhole

There isnt any said The Duke

Thats so Gerald shook his head sadly I dont see what he can do
then

Harry threatened them behind the glass You open that door you silly
chumps I want my dinner

Did you get that asked The Duke

Gerald shook his head Only a faint murmur These soundproof booths
are wonderful arent they

Marvelous Whod ever suppose that a person could be as near as that
and not be heard

Harry was now doing his best to kick a hole through the wooden
paneling his expression an interesting mixture of amusement and
annoyance

Listen said The Duke I think I hear a tapping

He is probably trying to signal to us the way they do in the mines
you know when theyre imprisoned

I know They let food down to them through pipes somehow dont they
I wonder if we could get his dinner to him anyway We might telephone
it perhaps

If you dont open this door announced Harry desperately Ill break
the glass and you fellows will have to pay for it Fair warning

I hear a little better now said The Duke Perhaps he wants to come
out Gerald

I wonder How stupid of us Ill bet thats it Duke Suppose we open
the door and see

Silly asses grunted Harry as he emerged warm and disgusted

It makes an awful difference who the joke is on doesnt it dearie
asked The Duke sweetly

Somebody ought to tell someone about that said Harry and have it
fixed

And someone had better get into commons before someone loses someones
dinner replied The Duke You fellows been in

No we were on the way when Kirk asked us to find you and give you a
message

He was in a rush and asked me to call up his folks in New York and say
hed telephone this evening Couldnt get the house though Central
said they didnt answer I wonder if he knew about that door

I dont think so laughed Gerald as they ran up the steps of Whitson
He didnt look to be in a veryvery flippant mood

After dinner the three boys went up to Geralds room and loafed until
it was time to go to the game They reached the field early but found
the grand stand already nearly filled Forest Hill School had sent over
nearly a half hundred rooters and these had taken possession of one
end of the stand and were already tuning up for the afternoons vocal
performance A good many folks had come over from Greenburg and of
course Yardley had turned out to a man The crowds was still streaming
on to the field when the Forest Hill team trotted past the corner of
the stand and crossed the gridiron to throw off blankets along the
further sideline Gerald Harry and The Duke were idling by the ropes
on the Yardley side when Perky Davis the football manager stopped
Davis was a thin lighthaired youth with an habitual expression of
care and concern Just now he seemed more worried than ever and the
creases on his forehead were many and deep

Look whos here Gerald he said in a low voice

Geralds gaze followed the managers toward the grand stand

Who Perky he asked

Gibson of Broadwood the fellow who substitutes at guard See him
The big chap with the light gray overcoat and the derby hat sitting
next to the Forest Hill crowd Hes here to spy on us Probably thinks
we wont recognize him I wish hed choke We were going to use four or
five new plays today too Ill have to tell Payson

I remember him said The Duke Hes got his nerve hasnt he I
think he sees us looking at him

Let him muttered Davis Its just like Broadwood to send spies over
here

Seen any more asked Gerald

Davis shook his head searching the throng suspiciously Not yet
Maybe hes the only one They wouldnt send more than one I guess
He isnt much of a player but they say hes a mighty clever chap at
sizing up things

Well I suppose they have a right to do it if they want to said
Gerald And we cant very well put him out can we

No but he wont learn much because when I tell Payson he will shut
down on any new stuff Its too bad though because we need to try out
those plays

At that moment the Yardley team came on and the Yardley cheerers
started into action Wed better find some seats or there wont be
any suggested Harry

Wait a minute said Gerald Davis had hurried away and was speaking
to the coach When he turned back Gerald hailed him

What did Payson say Perky

Asked me if I was certain and I said I was Then he nodded and called
Charlie and Bert I guess theyre making over the programme

At a little distance Payson Merriwell and Simms were in consultation
The rest of the team had taken the field and the footballs were already
flying through the air

Someone ought to kick him out said Harry fixing the Broadwood youth
with hostile regard

We might kidnap him suggested The Duke dreamily Anyone got a
gunnysack handy We could tie him up in it and drop him into the
BosphorusI mean the Wissining

What we should have done said Davis is to have sent someone to
watch Broadwood play Nordham today If its fair for them its fair
for us

Its extremely lowbridge replied The Duke disapprovingly Quite
reprehensible whatever that may be Also fellows if anything should
happen to him hed have only himself to thank

Whats going to happen to him asked Gerald eyeing The Duke with
suspicion The Duke only smiled carelessly

Why ask me I dont say anything is going to happen I only say if
anything should happen

Oh murmured Davis disappointedly I thought perhaps you had a plan
to get rid of him

The Duke viewed him reprovingly Perky if you want anyone put out of
the way you must do it yourself I refuse to stain my hands with the
life blood of even a Broadwood fellow Im that particular

Well I hope he enjoys himself muttered the manager He wont learn
much anyway He nodded and hurried off drawing his notebook and
pencil into sight The Duke quietly beckoned Gerald and Harry toward
the entrance Outside the three stood for several minutes with their
heads together When they ambled carelessly back their countenances
were as innocent of guile as the faces of three babies Only there was
a suspicious twinkle in The Dukes eyes

The grand stand being filled the three found a space on the grass
near the rope and watched the two teams take their positions It was a
clear nippy Fall day with a brisk northwest breeze quartering across
the field and streamers of white clouds scudding by overhead Forest
Hill had won the toss and chosen the north goal The whistle blew and
Fales kicked off




CHAPTER XI

BROADWOOD IS FOILED


Yardleys first chance to score came within three minutes of the
kickoff after Forest Hills quarter had fumbled on the second play
and Stark had fallen on the ball near the twentyyard line But
although the Blue worked down to within twelve yards of the goal the
attack weakened and the pigskin changed hands Forest Hill kicked on
first down and the play went to the middle of the field And about the
middle of the field with small advantage to either side it stayed for
the rest of the twelveminute period with neither team being able to
gain much ground

A minute or two before the whistle sounded The Duke carelessly arose
yawned stretched and wandered away down the line Now and then he
paused to look back at the play or to speak to an acquaintance but
presently having left the grand stand far behind he doubled back and
hurried around between the stand and the tennis courts reappearing at
the entrance just as the two teams donning blankets paused for the
twominute intermission The Duke pushed his way through the throng
with an important air and faced the sloping tiers

Mr Gibson wanted at the telephone announced The Duke loudly Is
Mr Gibson here

Without appearing to look in his direction The Duke saw the Broadwood
fellow start in his seat look indecisively down and settle back again

Mr Gibson wanted at the phone he continued passing along in front
of the stand Mr Gibson wanted at the phone immediately Is Mr
Gibson here

The fellows took up the cry Is Mr Gibson here O you Mr Gibson
Show yourself Gib There he goes Here he is Who wants Gibson I
dont O you Mr Gibson

At the first aisle a tall broadshouldered youth in a derby hat was
picking his way down as unostentatiously as possible The Duke turned
back and met him as he reached the ground

Is your name Gibson he asked The other nodded Youre wanted at
the phone Ill show you where it is

Followed by the youth in the derby The Duke pushed his way through the
crowd about the entrance Back of him a whistle shrilled and the teams
lined up once more

Do you know who wants me asked Gibson as they started up the path

I couldnt say replied The Duke Nice day for the game isnt it
Youre a Forest Hill fellow arent you

Hm responded the other noncommittally Where is this telephone

Oxford replied The Duke leading the way around the front of the
gymnasium and thereby lengthening the journey Its right around the
corner here A burst of cheering came from the field below them and
Gibson looked regretfully over his shoulder

Those are your fellows cheering said The Duke I shouldnt wonder
if you beat us today How many of you came along

Erquite a number forty or fifty I guess This the building

Next said The Duke conducting the visitor past Merle Here we
are They went up the steps of Oxford and The Duke led the way down
the dim and silent corridor to the telephone booth Politely he opened
the door and Mr Gibson once inside politely and very carefully he
closed it The click of the lock was simultaneous with the lifting of
the receiver from the hook

Hello Hello This is Mr Gibson What say Gibson

Illustration Hello Hello This is Mr Gibson What say

The Duke stealing softly down the corridor heard no more At the
doorway he cast a fleeting glance back at the booth Then he slipped
from sight Halfway back to the field he paused and did an erratic
breakdown with much snapping of fingers and many loud chuckles Then
pulling his features back into their former innocence of expression
he went on He reached the gridiron at an exciting moment and had
seated himself between Gerald and Harry before his fellowconspirators
realized his return Then

All right whispered Gerald

The Duke supremely interested in the game closed one eye slowly and
portentously Gerald grinned Harry hugged a foot ecstatically Like a
sheep to the slaughter whispered The Duke gloatingly Oh what do
you suppose hes saying to Central

How long will he stay there asked Harry

Until he gets out Theres no one in the Office on Saturday
afternoons Anyway they couldnt hear himunless he broke a window
and yelled like sixty Did you tell Perky

Yes and theyve worked a couple of the new plays already

Tried to you mean corrected Harry gloomily They didnt gain much

Anyone scored asked The Duke

Not yet No ones had a chance Kendall tried a placement from the
fortyfive yards and missed by a yard Too bad He had the wind with
him too

Pete made a rotten pass though said Gerald Simms had to scramble
for it Its a wonder they got the kick off at all Theres the whistle
Halfs over

As the players seized their blankets and trotted off the field Davis
hurried up to the trio beside the rope

What did you do with him he asked in a hoarse whisper

Do with him With who asked The Duke innocently

Gibson

Perky you jump to conclusions returned The Duke calmly If
anything has been done to Mr Gibson you shouldnt lay it to me I have
nothing but the kindest sweetest sentiments toward the gentleman

Oh chop it Is heis he safe

Oh I do hope so replied The Duke Dont tell me that anything has
happened to him Perky

Quit kidding begged Davis I want to know Can we go ahead with the
new plays Duke Will he be back

Blessed if I know I know he isnt here now but theres no telling
how long hes going to stay away Tell you what Perky Ill stand at
the entrance and keep watch If I see him coming back Ill pass the
word to you and you can tell Payson

All right Ill tell Payson that Dont miss him though

Nary a miss Perky

The Duke followed by Gerald and Harry went to take up a position at
the corner of the grand stand and Davis scurried off to the gymnasium
in the wake of the team The Duke hands in pockets wandered outside
and viewed the path But save for the players trotting up the steps of
the gymnasium and Davis speeding to overtake them no one was in sight

Look here said Gerald who had been studying the situation in his
mind what that fellow will do is to tell Central that hes locked
up in the booth Then Central will telephone to Merle or Clarke and
theyll let him out We didnt think of that

The Duke frowned Thats so he acknowledged And its dollars to
doughnuts Central will get Collins on the phone and then there will
be the dickens to pay

Thunder breathed Harry

Just so agreed The Duke Well Im in for it now so theres no
use worrying and getting a wrinkle After all it was a patriotic deed
and my conscience is at peace I done it for the good of my fellow
critters

I dont see how Collins will know it was you said Harry hopefully
The Duke viewed him with a pitying eye

Merely because I paraded up and down in front of the grand stand
yelling my little heart out for Mr Gibson Harry Collins may be
dense but I think he will be able to follow that clue what

He will get you acknowledged Gerald sadly The question is

The question is what will I get Well never mind Whats done is did
And here comes the team again and Mr Gibson is not in sight What
I should have done after getting him in there was cut the line He
looked longingly up the hill Maybe it isnt too late yet he added
musingly

Then you would get it said Gerald I guess youve done enough
Duke

Sure too much is plenty Anyway if Mr Gibson doesnt get back
before the games over Ill be satisfied

The Yardley team came piling through the entrance Merriwell in the
lead Coach Payson and Davis following As he passed Davis lifted his
eyebrows questioningly and The Duke returned a reassuring shake of the
head Davis whispered to the coach and the latter smiled demurely as he
passed on to the field

You fellows said The Duke presently had better get away from here
If they see you sticking around with me theyre bound to think you had
a hand in it

So we did replied Gerald

So you didnt What did you do Id like to know Move on now move
on Dont block the sidewalk

Oh who cares asked Harry Its only a joke anyway They cant do
anything to any of us

Besides Gibson wont make a fuss said Gerald He wont want to
confess that he came over to spy on the team

Well suit yourselves replied The Duke with a shrug of his
shoulders If you must have trouble have it Theyre kicking off

The three saw the game or as much of it as they could from their
post at the same time keeping a sharp watch for the reappearance of
Mr Gibson The third period proved conclusively that Yardley still
had much to learn about offense Her attack in the middle of the
field was fairly strong and at times showed flashes of brilliancy
but once past the thirtyyard line her play slowed up and all the
punch vanished Forest Hill although light was remarkably quick and
decidedly scrappy She had many defeats to atone for and when the
third period ended like the previous ones without a score against her
it was evident that she had come to the conclusion that here was the
opportunity to obtain vengeance She started the fourth quarter with a
dash and vim that startled the spectators and staggered the Blue team
Her backfield working together beautifully fooled Yardley time and
again and made short and steady gains until the ball was well down in
the Blues territory and Simms was imploring his men to stop them It
was only the Blues secondary defense that stood between Forest Hill
and a score for the Yardley line was too slow and played too high and
the Forest Hill backs sliced through it almost at will Payson made two
changes when the ball was down on the Blues thirtytwo yards putting
in Jackson for Fales and Jensen for Stark And later just before the
end of the game Best relieved Girard at center The rest of the team
however played the contest through and that without gaining much
credit Yardley captured the ball on her twentyfiveyard line worked
a double pass for a slight advance and then punted out of danger

But Forest Hill came back desperately Her quarter led a glorious
attack and what had been on the point of happening for two periods
finally happened An onside kick was recovered by a Forest Hill back
Metz and Crandall each missed a tackle and the runner after tearing
off nearly twenty yards was finally downed by Simms on the Blues
seventeen yards The ball was well over toward the side of the field
when the two teams lined up again and a skintackle play gained two
yards and brought the pigskin nearer the center of the field The
fullback trotted to the twentyfiveyard line and although the angle
was severe it seemed that a dropkick might put the ball over But
Forest Hill smarting under many defeats disdained a victory so simply
bought The ball went back to the outstretched arms but the fullback
didnt kick Instead he dashed off across the field with the two
teams trailing after him found a chance to turn in eluded one player
after another while the Forest Hill supporters on the stand shrieked
their triumph and finally dragging two Yardley players after him
staggered and crawled across the goal line

That touchdown spelled defeat for Yardley and even the staunchest
supporter of the Blue realized it Even though Forest Hill failed at
the goal the lead was too big to overcome in the two or three minutes
that remained But Yardley went desperately to work again It was
agreed afterward that had she played during the first of the game as
she played then there would have been a different tale to tell Using
every play he knew Simms when a lucky fumble gave Yardley the ball
after the kickoff hurled his backs and tackles against the weakening
Forest Hill line From their own forty yards to the enemys thirtyfive
they went gaining their distance at times by only an inch or two but
always gaining it And there with the timekeeper proclaiming forty
seconds left Kendall was sent back to the fortyfiveyard line while
the stand held its breath took the ball breasthigh from Best dropped
it lightly to earth and sent it spinning as straight as an arrow over
the very center of the crossbar

Let us be thankful for small favors Five to three was better than five
to naught and Yardley cheered philosophically and rose up in the grand
stand and called Kendall blessed And at the entrance The Duke casting
one final glance up the hill derived what satisfaction he might from
a plot well carried out

Forest Hill all smiles hurried off with the captured football and
Yardley rather glum and very tuckered wrapped her blankets about her
and trotted back to the gymnasium under the stigma of her first defeat

Gerald and Harry were inclined to dejection although Kendalls
brilliant goal from the field was a mitigating ray in the surrounding
gloom of failure But The Duke with the fine bravado of one on the way
to the guillotine refused to be downcast

Who cares he demanded Whats Forest Hill to us She showed us we
werent as good as we thought we were and that ought to help Its
Broadwoods scalp we want fellows and todays little setback will
do us a lot of good Besides he chuckled our friend Gibson is
returning emptyhanded Let us rejoice and make merry O my comrades
for tomorrow we die At least I do




CHAPTER XII

COTTON MEETS A FRIEND


Mr William Gibson of Broadwood Academy really deserves no place in
this narrative yet I hardly see how we can keep him out inasmuch as
his trip to Yardley that Saturday afternoon proved to be the first link
in a chain of events involving many of the principal actors in our
little drama For if Gibson had not come to Yardley he would not have
been ignominiously imprisoned in the telephone booth and if he had not
been shut up in the booth he would not have run across Charles Cotton
andbut I am getting ahead of the story

The practice of detailing players or coaches to attend games played
by a rival school or college in order to gain information that may
aid in defeating such rival is a questionable one in spite of its
prevalence and I have no intention of defending it At the same time
I very much doubt if William Gibsonover at Broadwood they called
him Billyconsidered that he was doing anything out of the way I am
willing even eager to attribute the highest patriotic motives to
Mr Gibson up to the time he met Charles Cotton For what happened
subsequently I offer no excuses Even the most rabid patriotism will
not explain it

Gibson had purposely attired himself to look as little like a
student as possible That is he had donned a derby hat instead of
the usual cap and a rather dressy light overcoat hoping perhaps
to give the impression of being a young gentleman of mercantile
pursuits say a youthful but promising bank clerk or a budding broker
Unfortunately Billys countenance and figure once seen were nearly
unforgettable The countenance was heavy and pugnacious and the figure
broadshouldered and massive massive even for his eighteen years He
had never actually attained a first choice position on the Broadwood
eleven but he was a good player and an excellent substitute guard and
he had more than once opposed Yardley during his football career He
had taken pains to arrive early at the field and was in his seat before
the teams came on the field and it is probable that his presence
would not have been discovered by the enemy had not Daviss eyes gone
roaming over the Forest Hill contingent in search of an acquaintance
Gibson saw that he was recognized the hostile stares of the group
below told him that and he was disappointed However there was no
help for it and as he was there he might as well remain Even if
Yardley failed to show any new tricks it was still possible to get a
line on her formations in attack and defense and get a general idea of
her ability When The Duke summoned him to the telephone Gibson had no
suspicions It was quite possible that the Broadwood coach had thought
of some feature of Yardleys playing that he wanted information on
He hesitated for a moment to show himself thinking that perhaps his
presence might be resented Then realizing that he had already been
recognized and that to disregard the summons would look strange he
answered it It was only when cooped up in the telephone booth he
learned from the Greenburg operator that there was no record of any
call for him that it began to dawn upon him that he had been made the
victim of a hoax

Very angrily he slammed up the receiver and pushed at the door A
minute or so later his anger had visibly increased It was too dark
in the booth to examine the latch with any hope of discovering the
trouble There was nothing for it but to raise his voice in a demand
for release which he did Unfortunately however it is very doubtful
if there was a living soul from one end of Oxford Hall to the other
Eventually perhaps ten minutes after he had unsuspectingly entered the
booth the plan of breaking open the door occurred to him He tried it
The telephone company however had caused that booth to be constructed
of exceedingly strong materials and finally Gibson very warm and
breathless gave up the attempt Next he considered breaking the glass
There were several panes and he could take his choice But while he
had not hesitated to try to force the lock or wreck a panel the idea
of breaking glass struck him as peculiarly destructive and he paused
to consider And at about that time it occurred to him that a very
simple way of escape confronted him He snatched down the receiver and
explained his predicament to a sympathetic Central

I will call up the Office said the operator

But the Office was empty and no one answered her ring So she tried
Clarke Hall and was successful The telephone in Clarke was in the
study of Mr Collins the Assistant Principal Ordinarily Mr Collins
would have been out at this hour of the afternoon but it so happened
that a slight cold had suggested to him the advisability of remaining
indoors and taking a nap The imperative ringing of the telephone bell
put an end to the nap and some five minutes later having discarded
dressinggown and slippers in favor of outer clothing and shoes Mr
Collins none too pleased with the necessity strode down the corridor
of Oxford and liberated a strange perspiring youth from his cell
Gibson failing in the dimness of the hall to recognize authority in
the slight mediumsized person before him immediately gave vent to
his wrath

Say what kind of a fool thing is that he demanded Ive been
suffocating in there for twenty minutes

Mr Collins viewed him gravely

Wonder you wouldnt have that latch fixed It would have served you
right if Id bust the glass out of it

It pains me deeply to learn of your discomfort replied the Assistant
Principal dryly Perhaps if you had telephoned to Central at once youd
have been released sooner May I ask who you are and how you happen to
have been using the booth

Gibson having now discovered that he was talking to neither a student
nor the janitor changed his tune My name is Gibson II came to see
the football game A fellow sung out that I was wanted on the telephone
and showed me up here When I asked the operator she said no one had
called me Then I tried to get out and couldnt

Hm said Mr Collins We have reported the matter to the company and
they have agreed to send up and fix that latch As a matter of fact
I presumed that they had done so I am very sorry Gibson I dont
understand however why the messenger should have deceived you Some
mistake doubtless

Hehe did it on purpose blurted Gibson still too angry to be
discreet Mr Collins looked surprised They had reached the steps and
now the Assistant Principal viewed the boy thoughtfully

Why he asked

II dont know muttered Gibson It doesnt matter though IIll
be going Thank you sir

One moment please You live in Greenburg

Gibson hesitated Then No sir IIm at Broadwood I just came over
to see the game

Really Mr Collins raised his brows Your Broadwood team doesnt
play today then

Yes sir they play Nordham

At home

Yes sir

You however preferred to see this game eh I see Now this boy who
brought you up here Gibson what was he like

Gibson rather uncomfortable under the others sarcastic gaze thought
a moment and at last gave a very excellent description of The Duke
Mr Collins nodded again Then he smiled It was a fleeting smile but
Gibson saw it

He knew Id get locked up in there he declared aggrievedly He
closed the door after me himself

I find no difficulty in crediting that Gibson replied Mr Collins
gravely I think I know the young gentleman and Ill have something to
say to him Goodday Gibson I regret exceedingly that you have missed
seeing so much of the game Perhaps however it is not yet entirely
over

But whether it was or wasnt Gibson had no idea of returning to the
field He remained on the steps a moment watching Mr Collins out of
sight around the corner of the old stone building and then thrusting
his hands into his pockets set off with a frown down the drive He had
almost reached the entrance gate at the foot of The Prospect when he
saw a boy walking rapidly toward him from the direction of the village
Gibson wasnt at all interested in the other pedestrian and gave him
no more than a thought But when they drew abreast he glanced up
casually Recognition was mutual

Hello Cotton what the dickens are you doing here

Hello Gibson What are you doing here

Me Just came over to see the game Say you arent at school here
are you

Cotton nodded Yes I entered this Fall I dont like it though

Gibson grinned none too kindly You dont like it anywhere very long
do you I thought someone said you were at school somewhere down South

I was last year But Id rather be up North

Gee did they fire you too laughed Gibson

Cotton colored No he answered shortly I didnt like it So I
didnt go back

They didnt like you you mean How you getting on here

All right replied Cotton ignoring the statement in favor of the
question Its a punk school though Not half as good as Broadwood

Wonder you didnt behave yourself when you were with us then said
Gibson Youre a bit of a mutt Cotton I guess Well I must be
getting on How far is it to Greenburg

Oh twenty minutes maybe Is the game over

No judging by the sounds it isnt Ive had enough of it though
Youve got a rotten team here this year Cotton

You bet we have assented the other eagerly Thats what I tell
them Youll lick the stuffing out of them Gibson Are you on the team
this year

Me Not exactly Im running Browne pretty hard though I may get on
next week Why arent you at the game

I had to get a letter off on the three oclock mail and the only way
to do it was to take it to Greenburg They only have two collections a
day up here Its a rotten place I wanted to see the game too Thats
why I was hurrying back

Well dont let me keep you

Oh thats all right Theyll get licked anyway

Gibson who had turned to go on paused and observed Cotton attentively
speculatively You dont seem to love your team Cotton he suggested

Oh theyre a great bunch of snobs replied Cotton bitterly If you
havent got some sort of a drag you cant get any show Its that way
with everything here Now at Broadwood

Your admiration for your dear old alma mater is touching sneered
Gibson I suppose you tried for the team and got chucked eh

I didnt have any pull They dont care how well you play If you
dont know the fellows

Hm said Gibson thoughtfully Well say if you arent crazy to see
the end of the game Cotton why dont you turn around and walk back to
Greenburg with me Ill treat to a soda if you like and well have a
chin

Sure I dont care about the game It must be almost over now
anyway But what were you doing over here Gibson Cotton frowned his
perplexity

Me Oh just watching Gibson winked slowly and meaningly

By Jove Cotton smiled delightedly Thats your game eh Did you
get anything

Think Id tell you if I did laughed Gibson taking the other boys
arm

Oh shucks said Cotton You can trust me old man you know that

Well come along and Ill tell you about it




CHAPTER XIII

THE DUKE STARTS SOMETHING


The day after the Forest Hill defeat was warm and languid more like
a November day Gerald had gone to Sound View the evening before
as was his custom when his father was at home and Kendall having
attended church in the forenoon and eaten a dinner at the training
table for which he had had little appetite was at a loss how to spend
his afternoon There were fellows whom he might look up and who would
doubtless be glad to see him but somehow he didnt feel very sociable
For one thing he had been through fortyeight minutes of hard play the
day before and felt lame and battered although there were no scars
to show Perhaps too the weather induced a feeling of apathy it
was too warm He wrote his Sunday letter taking a good deal of time
over it and managing to fill six pages But after that was sealed and
addressed there seemed nothing left to do Gerald had suggested that
he might come up after dinner and take him to ride in the automobile
but evidently Gerald had changed his mind The dormitory was quiet and
probably pretty well deserted for it was no sort of a day to stay
indoors Kendall finally reached that conclusion himself and pulling
a cap on to the back of his head he sauntered along the hall and down
the stairs and so out into the afternoon world wincing now and then
when his sore muscles protested and dimly oppressed with the emptiness
of existence Kendalls condition of mind was had he but known it
no uncommon one for the football player the day after a hard game and
a defeat One cares very little for bruises and weariness after a
victory but a defeat takes all the glory from them

There was a handful of fellows on the steps as he came out and he spoke
to them but had no wish to join them There were other groups in front
of Whitson and Oxford and several boys were lolling on the grass
near the flagpole on The Prospect One or two had books but it was
a noticeable fact that none was reading Even the effort of holding a
book was too much on such a day Kendall nodded now and then refused
an invitation to join the group on the grass and skirted Oxford with
a dim idea of walking down to the river But back of Merle he heard a
hail and turning saw The Duke waving to him across the yard The
Duke was resplendent today There was a suit of bluegray flannel a
vividly pink shirt dark blue socks tan shoes and a green tie And
The Duke seemed in high feather Kendall sat down on the step of Merle
and waited for the gorgeous one to join him He had not seen The Duke
since shortly after the game the day before and now he wondered whether
that youth had got into difficulties over the affair of Mr Gibson
He certainly didnt have the appearance of a fellow in trouble One
would have thought seeing him coming along the path hands in pockets
whistling cheerfully that he hadnt a care in the world

Greetings O doughty warrior saluted The Duke

Hello replied Kendall apathetically Wheres the party

Party Oh you refer to my chaste getup The Duke viewed his apparel
approvingly Some togs what He seated himself beside Kendall
Theres no party Sir Knight I have merely dressed myself according
to my mood My mood today is one of triumph and joy Wheres Gerald

Home replied Kendall moodily

Hes a lucky chap to have a home around the corner Be it never so
humble theres no place like home Whats the matter with you today
Got the dumps

Nno

Meaning yees Perk up Observe the cerulean sky and the waving tree
tops the bright sun and thethe

Its a beast of a day

What Its a wonderful day What do you want Rain Snow Hail
Well if the things Ive mentioned dont cheer you look at my shirt
That ought to drive away any case of blues

It looks sort of pink said Kendall smiling with an effort

Sort of pink Sort of pink Man alive its the quintessence of
pink Its the pinkest thing that ever happened Thats why I bought
it Got it cheap too Theyd had it in the store for years and years
No one would buy it No one had the courage to But pink suits me you
know Goes well with my shelltint complexion

But why the green tie

A happy conceit of mine own O Youth of the Festive Toe I am
impersonating a carnation The dash of green represents the leaves Get
me Pretty thought what

Very And the rest of thethe things Blue socks

Contrast dear boy contrast Also variety Also gladness and joy and
triumph Come on The Duke jumped up gayly

Where asked Kendall with no enthusiasm

Where Anywhere Who knows Let us start out in search of adventure
This is no day to mope and pine I am consumed by a desire to start
something

You started something yesterday didnt you How did you come out Did
Collins get after you

Oh that The Duke smiled carelessly and brushed an imaginary speck
from his sleeve That is too trifling to speak of

What did he say

Say What was there he could say I had merely to explain the
circumstances to him Burtis After all he is reasonablefor a
faculty Or mayhap I spoke convincingly In any caseThe Duke waved
a hand magnificentlywe parted with sentiments of mutual respect and
esteem If you will join me in a stroll toward yon purling stream I
will regale your ears with a brief narration of the event

All right Kendall pulled himself up with a sigh and they moved on

We met by appointment continued The Duke gayly Collins made
the appointment In his study He suggested eight oclock as a time
convenient to him and as I am noted for my good nature I agreed
Also as I have ever held punctuality to be the soul of wit or the
thief of time or the shortest way home or somethingI forget the exact
quotationI was there on the stroke

Ill bet you were agreed Kendall grimly The Duke smiled

On the very dot O Wisdom Personified And thenwe talked At first
he did most of it It seemsThe Duke interrupted the narrative to
chuckleit seems that our friend Gibson had the brilliant thought
to call up Central and tell his troubles Central thereupon called up
Collins I could speak harshly to Central about that but as it has all
turned out satisfactorily I wont Well Collins formed himself into a
rescue party and trailed over to Oxford Having liberated our prisoner
they passed the time of day and in the course of the conversation Mr
Gibson let us hope inadvertently gave a description of my physical
appearance and Collins being a great friend of mine recognized the
portrait or thought he did Hence the appointment Of course I dont
know just what those two said to each other but I have a strong hunch
that Collins wormed out of Mr Gibson the fact that he was a Broadwood
unfortunate and surmised the fact that he was to put it courteously
over here to rubber at our splendid team of football heroes

What time is it asked Kendall

Time I dont know replied The Duke fumbling at his watchfob
Why Got something on

No I was only thinking that if you didnt get started pretty soon it
would be supper time

Oh The Duke laughed You have a dry wit my friend a dry wit and a
ready Well to cut out the nonessentials and the rhetorical effects
Burtis Collins asked me if I had enticed Mr Gibson to the phone Of
course I lowed as how I had Then he asked me why Because quoth
I he was over here to spy on the team and Payson wanted to try out
some of the new plays for the Broadwood game But you told him that
he was wanted at the telephone says Collins Wasnt that a lie
Wellington No sir I retorted not at all We wanted him at the
telephone so he wouldnt see what was going on at the field Whereupon
Collins said Um in two or three different tones and looked kind
of funny at me Of course I was looking as nearly like an innocent
little George Washington as I knew how But still Wellington hardly
truthful eh he asked I considered Perhaps not strictly sir I
said but we had to do something and what else was there Well I
had him stumped there He opened his mouth a couple of times but he
couldnt answer There wasnt anything else was there Of course
not Collins saw it too after a minute but he wouldnt say so He
hemmed a few hems and hawed a few haws and smiled in his funny dry
way And finally he said Wellington if you applied some of your
ingenuity to mastering your studies youd be better off I said Yes
sir Then he frowned and waved his hand you know like that You
may go he said And I thanked him and went Only when I got to the
door he stopped me Mind you said he youre not to think that I
approve of what you did Wellington because I dont It smacks too
much of deceit It would have been better had you gone to a telephone
and really called him up I never thought of that I said Then he
grinned a little and I grinned and came out

Kendall laughed The next time wed better consult Collins I guess I
suspect he was just as pleased as we were that Gibson got left

Probably Aside from being a member of faculty hes fairly human
Anyhow I got off easy Hence my mood of triumph Lets go for a
paddle

They had reached the boathouse The porch and float were well sprinkled
with fellows and the river as far as they could see was dotted with
canoes and skiffs

I dont know how to row Kendall demurred

Who wants to row Can you paddle

Less than I can row

Well you go as ballast then Ive got a canoe in here somewhere if it
hasnt fallen to pieces Havent been in it since Spring Come on

Kendall followed the other into the boathouse and helped him lift a
battered green canvas canoe from the rack When it was outside The
Duke viewed it dubiously Looks sort of leaky doesnt it he asked
Guess wed better take a bailer along Hi Lin got something I can
bail out with

Lin Johnson picked up a tin can from the bottom of the canoe he was
disembarking from and tossed it across The Duke caught it deftly
dropped it in the bottom of the green canoe and pushed the latter into
the water In a minute they were afloat Kendall facing The Duke from
the bow and watching rather enviously the skill with which the latter
managed a paddle from the blade of which a good two inches had been
splintered They went up the little river meeting other craft and
exchanging greetings Once The Duke remarked laughingly

Funny how tickled everyone is to see me today It pays to travel in
good company

How do you mean asked Kendall innocently

Why dont you see how cordial the fellows are Thats because youre
here O Mighty Warrior If I were alone theyd just nod and say Lo
Duke Now they nearly fall out of their canoes being polite

Nonsense said Kendall blushing a little Why lots of those
fellows weve passed hardly know me

Thats only because you wont let them Theyd all be tickled to death
to be in my place Why my stock will go up a hundred per cent this
afternoon

Kendall smiled doubtfully I guess theyd a good deal rather know you
than me he murmured

Think so my Modest Violet You miss your guess then I wonder if
youre as innocent as you seem Burtis

Innocent

Yes Youre really a school hero you know but you dont seem to be
on to the fact You could put on all sorts of lugs and the fellows
would stand for it but instead you hardly notice anyone and go around
looking as humble asas a worm Of course Im not saying it isnt a
clever scheme because the less you seem to want to know fellows the
more anxious theyll be to have you Get me And being modest is a good
game too Lots of fellows in your place would be swaggering all around
the shop patronizing us lesser mortals Wed stand for it all right
enough but wed resent it a bit too and if you ever came a cropper
fell down in the big game you know or something of that sort how
wed jump on you No a fellow can have a swelled head and get by with
it if hes making good but you dont love him any more for it Your
way is much better Burtis

I dont know what youre talking about said Kendall a trifle
indignantly Im not a hero and dont pretend to be I dont want to
be and Im not trying to be

The Duke grinned Of course not I understand Youre not one of our
star players on the football team and you dont win games for us by the
niftiest kicking thats ever been seen in these parts You seem to but
you dont Appearances are against you

Youre an idiot grunted Kendall

Oh certainly

Besides its silly to say I dont want to know fellows I do There
are lots of tiptop fellows Id like awfully well to know but I cant
butt in the waythe way

The way I do suggested The Duke helpfully

The way some fellows do

I really believe you mean it marveled The Duke Why you poor
benighted heathen dont you realize that theres hardly a fellow in
school who wouldnt be proud to paddle you up and down the river all
the afternoon just for the glory of being seen with you

No I dont replied Kendall shortly and neither do you And I wish
youd stop kidding me Duke Kendall was looking red and embarrassed
and The Duke observing took pity on him

All right he said soothingly Youre a mere worm after all Burtis
No one loves you And when a fellow falls into the river trying to be
polite its just because he wants me to notice him But will I I will
not They can drown before Ill give them a glance

Youre an awful idiot said Kendall smilingly

You said that before and so there must be something in it was the
cheerful response And now here is the island and with your approval
I suggest we get out and find a nice warm spot and lie on our backs and
think great thoughts

So the canoe was pulled up on the little strip of beach at Flat Island
and the boys threw themselves down on the bank in the sunlight It was
getting toward four oclock and a slight chill was making itself felt
But in the lee of the trees it was still comfortably warm The Duke put
his hands under his head cocked one foot over his knee and gazed up
into the peaceful blue sky Kendall followed his example and for the
space of several minutes nothing was said Finally though Kendall
broke the silence

Did youdid you really mean any of that stuff you said awhile ago in
the canoe Duke he asked

What stuff asked the other drowsily

Aboutabout fellows being willing to know me

Of course I meant it You my shy and retiring friend are one of our
notables Were proud of you because you play good football and won the
Broadwood game for us last year And because you kept Forest Hill from
shutting us out yesterday Were proud of any fellow here who does what
hes set to do and does it well but when a fellow wins a game from
Broadwood for us we put our heads in the dust and say Walk on us O
Conqueror

That sounds silly objected Kendall

Then its the way I say it It really isnt silly Look here didnt
you want to run out and hug Dan Vinton last Spring when he hit out
that twobagger that tied the Broadwood game Werent you proud of
him Didnt you think he was about the finest thing that ever played
baseball

You bet

Well there you are You did the same thing didnt you last Fall
And youre still doing it arent you Thats why youre some pumpkins
here old scout why the Prep Class youngsters get in your way and
stare at you soulfully until you fall over them Then they get together
and show the toe you stepped on and boast how much it hurts Thats why
fellows try to be nice to you even if you dont see it and why dozens
of them will be as sweet as candy to me for days because I know you
well enough to go paddling with you And thats why Im here now It
isnt because I care a cent about you you bore me to death but I want
the other fellows to see me with you Reflected glory Get me

Kendall looked startledly at The Duke until the latter began to grin
Then he smiled and looked relieved

I never thought of that he murmured IIm glad

Well dont think of it too much now cautioned The Duke Perhaps I
oughtnt to have said anything about it I guess the reason we all like
you so well is partly because youbecause youre so unconscious of it
Dont spoil it Burtis

Ill try not to I dont more than half believe it anyway I guess
he answered shyly Id like to think though thatthat fellows did
like me a little

You may O Startled Fawn And if you take my advice youll be a
trifle moremorewhats the wordresponsive Its a good thing for
a fellow to have friends It helps here and hereafter If you go up
to college youll find that having friends there will make a lot of
difference Ive never been to college but thats what they tell me
And in the meanwhile if theres any little thing youd likea place on
the hockey team or the baseball nine or next years class presidency
or the presidency of your societywhat are you by the way Oxford
arent youjust mention the fact quite casually Its a good time
Maybe you wont get all you want but its a good plan to let fellows
know

I dont want a thing replied Kendall in an alarmed voice

The Duke laughed All right you neednt get scared though I just
mentioned it Theres Jensen and Jim Hough coming down the placid
stream Just for fun now lets see what they do when they catch sight
of us here Would it be quite convenient for you to sit up

What for

So they can recognize your charming countenance of course Its
dollars to doughnuts theyll come ashore

Id rather not said Kendall hurriedly

Oh all right It isnt necessary anyhow I guess theyve seen you
for theyre headed this way And behind them come Perky Davis and
Whitehall Know Whitehall

Ive met him Hes the editor of the paper isnt he

He is Whitehall is our one best highbrow Hes an awful bore but
hes a goodhearted chap for all that Yes here they come Hello
Jim Come ashore and hear the birdies sing Greetings Jensen you old
Dutchman You fellows know Burtis dont you Hello Perky Well well
if it isnt our old friend Horace Greeley Whitehall Wonders never
cease Step ashore Horace and join the crowd Youre just the fellow
Ive been wanting to see Ive been telling Burtis that he ought to get
out and try for the Scholiast next term

Really asked Whitehall turning eagerly to Kendall By Jove
Burtis I wish you would you know We need fellows of your kind on the
paper

Thats what I tell him said The Duke mendaciously He hasnt
decided about it yet you know but hes terribly interested arent
you Burtis

Whywhywhy I think it would be very nice stammered Kendall Do
you think I could do anything

I dont know who could if you couldnt responded Whitehall




CHAPTER XIV

KIRK EXACTS A PROMISE


Kendall returned to his room a half hour before supper time in a
condition of mental amazement He had practically agreed to go out
for the Scholiast after Christmas recess and had made the startling
discovery that an editorship on the school weekly was just what he
wanted Whitehall had kindly and almost apologetically explained that
at first just for a while you know Kendall would have to do
reporting so as to learn the ropes But none of the group on the island
had seemed to doubt for a moment that Kendall would ultimately succeed
to the position of editorinchief When he had spoken modestly of
his lack of experience the fellows had waved the thing aside as of no
consequence

That will be all right Davis had declared It wont take you any
time to get the hang of it And there had been a most flattering
emphasis on the you

Only Jim Hough had seemed unenthusiastic Jim had expressed doubt
that a fellow could be on the Scholiast and give the proper amount
of time and attention to football Whereupon had ensued an argument
between Jim and Whitehall as to the comparative importance of football
and journalism the latter making the absolutely absurd claim that
journalism was the greater pursuit of the two In the end they had
appealed to Kendall for his opinion and he had put an end to the
dispute by smilingly suggesting that they allow him to defer judgment
until he knew more about journalism a suggestion that seemed to
impress everyone with its marvelous wisdom Or everyone save The
Duke The Duke had grinned like the Cheshire cat all the time and had
more than once favored Kendall with a surreptitious and knowing wink
thereby adding to Kendalls embarrassment

For it was embarrassing To discover suddenly that instead of the
nonentity one supposes oneself to be one is in reality a public
character a person of prominence in short a quasihero is bound
to be both embarrassing and disturbing But once having had his eyes
opened Kendall could not doubt that The Duke had spoken truly He had
only to observe how attentively the others listened to what he said
how eager they seemed to have him express opinions how stoutly they
believed in his ability to make the Scholiast and succeed at the
work But it was pleasant almost intoxicatingly pleasant and Kendall
went back to Clarke Hall in a mood far different from that in which he
had left The world no longer seemed dull or empty It was indeed a
very wonderful world filled with many likable people and teeming with
possibilities Kendalls feelings were reflected so plainly in his
countenance when he entered Number  that Gerald who had unexpectedly
returned for supper and was entertaining George Kirk viewed him in
surprise

Hello he exclaimed whats happened to you Kendall Anybody left
you a fortune

Not that I know of replied Kendall after greeting Kirk IIve
been on the river with The Duke We had a bully time

With The Duke What the dickens did you do

Oh nothing much Just paddled up to the island and sat there Some
fellows came along and we talked

And thats your idea of a bully time marveled Gerald George
observe our young friend and take a lesson from him Forget that
Broadwood beat you yesterday Paddle on the river and cheer up

Did they really beat us asked Kendall

Kirk nodded gloomily They simply slaughtered us

Dont get him on the subject again Kendall begged Gerald I found
him moping on the steps and brought him along to brighten him up Hes
wailed and bewailed for half an hour and I can stand no more of it
Lets find a cheerful subject of conversation such as supper

Im awfully sorry said Kendall sympathetically

Let it go at that then said Gerald Youll start him off again if
you arent careful What lovely weather were having George

Kirk laughed Well well get back at them in the Spring he said
hopefully I wish youd try for the team Burtis

I dont think Id ever make a golfer replied Kendall You know I
tried last year Kirk

I know you did And did mighty well too All you need is practice
I wish youd think it over Its so hard to get good fellows for the
team

Maybe I will if you want me to said Kendall I like golf very
much only I dont believe Id ever become much of a player

I think you would replied Kirk earnestly Any fellow who can do
as well in football as youre doing and has such a dandy sense of
directions and distance as you must have to kick those goals ought to
make a good golfer

Kendall smiled and seeing the inquiring look on Kirks face
explained I was thinking of something Ned Tooker said last year Ned
said that a good football player couldnt be a good golf player that
the one spoiled him for the other I forget just why

Kirk laughed Well Ned was the best golfer weve ever had here but
he didnt know everything And besides Ned was fond of saying things
just for the sound of them

A common failing grieved Gerald as he splashed and gurgled at the
stand Alas howgurglefew of ussniff splashconsider the
sensesniff sniffof our utterances Wheres that towel

Then its a promise is it Burtis asked the golf captain eagerly

Whyeryes if you like At least Ill give it a fair try Kirk

Good stuff Well have some games together after the Broadwood games
over Well Ill run along Bye Gerald

Bye answered Gerald from behind a towel Call again Georgie

Perhaps I will some day By the way Kirk stopped at the door What
sort of a chap is that Cotton I mean the fellow who rooms with The
Duke All right is he

All right echoed Gerald Id say he was pretty much all wrong
Theres no harm in him though I guess Ask Kendall Hes a great chum
of Kendalls Thick as thieves they are

Oh well I guess hes all right then said Kirk I asked
because He stopped looked thoughtfully puzzled a moment and then
nodding went out

Wonder what Cottons done to him said Gerald cheerfully If I were
a punster Id say it was evident Kirk doesnt cotton to him But Im
not and so I wont Did I hear you murmur your thanks

Eh asked Kendall blankly

Well where have you been Still thinking of what a wonderful time you
had on the river Gerald seemed a little disgruntled over that

No I was justjust thinking

What he had been thinking was that if he succeeded in making the
Scholiast and the Golf Team he would be a pretty busy chap the rest
of the year

Just how the trick played on Gibson of Broadwood got out is not known
Neither Gerald nor Kendall divulged it and The Duke refused to own
to having spoken of the matter But get out it did for by Monday
the whole school knew about it and was laughing delightedly Even the
Scholiast most dignified of school publications could not forebear
a fling and the next issue contained at the bottom of a page this brief
note

The Broadwood Academy Press announces for early publication Personal
Recollections of Booth by Gibson

Football practice on Monday was hard and long Several second string
players were temporarily promoted to the First Team for a number of
the regulars were still showing the effects of Saturdays game Kendall
played two periods and then yielded his position to Fayette and was
sent off On Tuesday however strains and bruises were healed and
the First Team lined up as on Saturday with the exception that Adler
was in place of Metz at right end Oliver Colton a former Yardley
captain arrived on Tuesday and stayed until the end of the week
putting in three days of hard coaching Under his tuition the guards
and tackles improved perceptibly The first serious accident of the
season happened Wednesday when Lin Johnson center of the Second Team
broke a shoulder blade and did it in such a messy way that there was
no question of any more football for him that season Ireland who
had been playing fullback on Houghs team took Johnsons place
but he didnt make much of a center and the First when it wanted a
gain through the middle of the opposing line spoke of taking a short
trip through Ireland But the Second struggled on gamely and if it
was no longer able to score touchdowns on the First sometimes got a
fieldgoal over

The massmeetings began Thursday night Everyone piled into Assembly
Hall on the top floor of Oxford and listened to speeches by Mr Payson
and Captain Merriwell and Mr Bendix Physical Director and sang
the old songs and experimented with new ones and cheered themselves
hoarse The Banjo and Mandolin Club provided the music assisted by
Perky Davis at the piano and its efforts to master some of the tunes
offered by enthusiastic amateur composers occasioned much merriment
among the audience below the stage Afterward Kendall who had promised
himself an hours tussle with algebra that evening went back alone
to Number  Gerald and Harry wandering off with Pete Girard to the
latters room in Dudley To Kendalls disgust when he reached Number
 he found the door ajar and Charles Cotton seated at the table
apparently deeply immersed in calculations with pencil and paper
Kendall disguised his surprise and disappointment and greeted the
visitor politely if without overmuch enthusiasm Cotton however
seemed to notice no lack of warmth

Just the fellow I wanted to see he announced without rising from
Kendalls chair Saw you at the meeting but lost you outside I want
you to see what you think of this scheme Burtis

What is it asked Kendall tossing aside his cap and leaning over the
others shoulder On the table lay a square of paper rudely scrawled
with circles and figures Im not much good at puzzles Cotton

Oh this isnt a puzzle Its something new in football signals

You dont say Whats the idea

Well look here Have you got another chair Bring it up like a good
fellow Im awfully interested in this and I want you tell me what you
think of it Now then he continued when Kendall had drawn a chair to
the table and seated himself heres the idea You know the signals
they use now are dreadfully complicated

Are they

Well arent they Take the Yardley system for instance We have two
sets of signals like this Cotton indicated his diagram Here are
the holes numbered from  to  Then the two ends the two tackles and
the four backs are numbered from  to  Now thats confusing isnt
it

I dont see why Kendall objected getting interested now We use
three numbers the first a fake the second indicating the runner and
the third the hole Thats not hard

Then we have special plays numbered too

Yes a special play is called by tacking its number on to  and when
Simms calls that he calls it right after the fake You cant get mixed
up there can you

Nno replied Cotton doubtfully I suppose not Stillnow suppose
left half was to take the ball through guardtackle hole on the right
How would you call that

We havent any such play If we had though Simms would give us say
  

Cotton studied his diagram That sounds harder than need be Your
 is your fake your  is your runner the second numeral of the
number indicating left halfback and the  is the hole the  meaning
between right guard and tackle Thats it isnt it

Of course

Have I got the positions numbered right

Not quite Youve got quarter numbered  should be 

That so Well you draw a diagram for me will you Im a lobster at
it Got another piece of paper

Kendall drew a pad toward him and quickly made a row of circles for the
forwards and added four more beneath for the backs Then he numbered
the holes and the players Cotton nodded approvingly

Thats fine and neat he commended Now suppose you were to punt
Burtis what would be the signal for that

Burtis back   

Nine means kick doesnt it

Yes and the  means nothing When you get to the  you know it is to
be a kick and pay no attention to anything afterwards Same way with
special plays Cotton For instance    means that the play
is to Play Number  The  means nothing its just tagged on to fill
out

Well that isnt as complicated as it seemed at first owned Cotton
As long as I was on the team we used only hole numbers you know and
the quarter indicated the runner with his fingers on his hip

Yes the Second does that still I think Its not a bad way if all
the backs can see the quarters fingers What is this scheme of yours
though

Cotton frowned a minute Then he shook his head It doesnt seem so
good now he confessed My plan was to use numbers for the holes
and letters for the players It seemed to me it would be easier to
remember

Thats not new smiled Kendall They used to use letters altogether
sometimes Ive heard Used to take a word with ten or eleven letters
no two the same of course and let a letter stand for the hole and the
player too I guess the number codes are better though

I suppose so or they wouldnt use them replied Cotton thoughtfully
folding up the paper Still I think a fellow might figure out a
simpler scheme than the one we use

Try it laughed Kendall If you hit on anything good I guess Payson
will be glad to use it

I suppose the best thing about the number signals is that they can be
changed easily Now I suppose these signals wont be used in Saturdays
game

Yes they will But theyll be changed for Broadwood

I see Cotton absently dropped the sheet of paper in his pocket as he
stood up Well Im going to have another go at it anyway Ill bet I
can beat this scheme I hope I havent been in the way Were you going
to do anything

Only grind a little replied Kendall Theres plenty of time yet So
long Cotton Let me know how you get on with that He nodded toward
the pocket in which lay the paper

I will Cotton patted his jacket as though he wasnt at all sure
where he had placed the sheet and nodded Goodnight

Kendall hunting his books reflected that Cotton wasnt so bad after
all Why tonight he had been quite human Of course he shouldnt
have taken possession of the room in the absence of the occupants
There was an unwritten law at Yardley that if a fellow was not in
you went no further than the threshold unless you happened to be a
particular friend and had permission to make yourself at home However
Cotton had behaved so amiably that Kendall was ready to forgive the
breach of manners He had almost liked the fellow tonight




CHAPTER XV

THE NEWS PREDICTS DEFEAT


Gerald sat on the lowest step in front of Oxford It was Friday morning
and a chilly depressing gray fog was driving in from the Sound
Somewhere in the distance a whistle buoy was moaning and at intervals
a steamer creeping along off shore bellowed hoarsely It was twenty
minutes before first recitation hour and Gerald had the entrance to
himself A copy of the mornings Greenburg News was held in front of
him getting damper and limper every minute and Gerald was perusing
the football column The News chronicled each day the progress of the
Yardley and Broadwood teams and as the game between the rival schools
approached the News devoted more and more space to them Today
the football specialist of the paper came out flatfooted with the
prediction that Broadwood would win the contest The News had of late
years shown a strong partiality to Yardley and this prediction troubled
Gerald the more for that reason

Its some time said the News since the Green has defeated the
Blue and lots of people around here have begun to wonder whether she is
ever going to repeat Even the longest road has its turning though
and the luck has to change some time And it looks very much now as
if the change would take place a week from tomorrow when Broadwood
and Yardley meet in their fourteenth annual contest In fact those who
have seen both teams in action dont hesitate to hand the victory to
the Green right now This may sound rash but they have plenty of good
argument to support their verdict with

On the seasons showing Broadwood is undoubtedly ahead She has met
teams equal to those Yardley has played and has survived every battle
without a defeat whereas Yardley fell an easy victim to Forest Hill
last week In total of points made Broadwood leads her ancient rival
by  to  not a wide margin certainly but sufficient to prove
Broadwoods greater scoring power Broadwood has been scored against
twice for a total of  Yardley as many times for a total of  Taking
the work of the two teams last Saturday as a basis of comparison the
Green is still in the lead She piled up a score of  points against
a worthy opponent and was scored on herself by a goalfromfield
In the last two quarters Broadwood played solely on the defensive
Meanwhile Yardley had the utmost difficulty to keep from being shut
out ignominiously by Forest Hill a much weaker team than Nordham
Forest Hill found the Yardley defense easy and especially in the
third period did about as she wanted with it She should have had at
least one more touchdown on the showing made Yardley secured her three
points when play was almost over the infallible Burtis toeing a very
pretty fieldgoal from the fortyfive yards It will be interesting to
see how Yardley performs against Nordham tomorrow by the way for
there is a strong sentiment on the hill in favor of beating Nordham at
any cost in view of the defeat which the latter institution handed to
the Blue last year

But comparative scores dont always tell the truth Nor does a teams
showing up to the moment of her final game mean very much Many a team
has gone through an unfortunate season and then turned in and taken the
measure of its rival in fine style Yardley therefore may surprise
us by showing a reversal of form tomorrow and piling up a bigger
score against Nordham than did Broadwood in which case those who are
predicting a Broadwood victory a week from tomorrow would have cause
for thought But there are other things to be considered besides
the seasons showing of the two teams and their comparative scores
Broadwood looks better on the field and in action as well as on paper
She has a hardplaying powerful team which will outweigh Yardley
three or four pounds to the man at least Her backfield will average
five pounds heavier And unlike heavy teams of previous years this
seasons Broadwood aggregation is fast fully as fast as Yardleys
With a dry field and no favor Broadwoods team should be worth at least
one score more than Yardleys

In style of play the rivals are much alike Both depend largely
on line plays to gain ground although Yardley with Burtis in the
lineup will naturally do a good deal of kicking That phenomenon
by the way although practically a new man this season has come at a
fast clip and those who consider him only as a brilliant punter and
dropkicker are in for a surprise As a dodging back he has no equal
on his own team and will suffer but little by comparison with Captain
Raynor of Broadwood The Green is ahead at present in the matter of
teamplay She seems to have got together earlier in the season than
usual and both defense and offense are running smoothly On the
whole the Green has a big powerful team this year one at least
twentyfive per cent better than that which suffered defeat last year
by the narrowest of margins On the other hand it cant be said that
Yardley is a whit better off than she was last November rather it is
doubtful if she is as well off She has had to build almost a whole new
team having suffered badly by graduation and so far whatever there
is in the team hasnt shown to be dangerous It may be that in the few
practice days remaining before the big show Coach Payson who is one
of the cleverest men handling a school eleven today will manage to
work a miracle If he doesnt we cant see but what there will be cause
for rejoicing in the Broadwood camp at sunset of the tha rejoicing
likely to be worth seeing because so long delayed

Gerald lowered the paper thoughtfully If you believe that he
murmured were beaten this minute I guess Broadwood is pretty good
this year everybody is saying so Id hate to have the school get
beaten my last year though He shook his head I wonder if Payson
has anything up his sleeve Kendall says hes developing end run
plays to beat the band Maybe thats the answer Broadwood cant be
so terribly fast if shes as heavy as this fellow says and perhaps
Payson expects to work the ends and try field goals Seems to me that
would be his best plan Theres no denying that our backfield is weak
on lineplunging They showed that Saturday He took up the paper
again Lets see what the games are tomorrow Yale plays Brown
Thatll be a cinch Harvard plays Cornell

What are you muttering about asked a voice Gerald looked up to find
Harry beside him What are you trying to do Gerald Get rheumatism
and pneumonia and a few other things

No Im doing this for my complexion replied Gerald with a grin
They say fog is great for the complexion

Brr Id rather go without the complexion Come on inside unless
youre doing penance out here

Seen the News this morning asked Gerald as he followed the other
up the steps

No anything in it

A column or so about the teams Were going to get licked It says so

Harry smiled untroubledly Youll have to show me he said Why
what does the paper know about it

Youd think it knew everything about it to read it answered Gerald
sadly Who is going to win anyhow

Little old Yardley replied Harry unhesitatingly Cheer up Youre
full of fog Isnt this a peach of a day

Fine They laid their books on a radiator near the entrance and
backed up to the warmth What are your reasons for thinking so

Thinking what Oh about the game Why we always do win dont we
Whats to keep us from doing it again

The luck has to change answered the other unconsciously quoting the
News They say Broadwood has a dandy team this year

Of course she always has But what of it So have we

The News says we havent

Harry seized the paper and dropped it behind the radiator If you
wouldnt read such stuff you wouldnt be worried They have to fill
the paper up with something and they might as well say one thing as
another Hows Kendall

Blooming Have you noticed anything about him the last three or four
days

No what I havent seen very much of him

Well he seemsdifferent somehow Has moremore assurance Why
I came across him yesterday talking with Perry Whitehall as thick
as two thieves And Wednesday he actually got into a discussion with
Simms about something and threshed it right out with him and made
Simms back down Something about some formation in football And he
looks different too Gerald frowned thoughtfully at the bust of
Pallas across the corridor Looks as though he kind of thought more of
himself

Well laughed Harry theres no harm in that But what about the
campaign Do we make progress

We surely do but a whole lot depends on what Kendall does in the
next two games If he will do a star act or two he cant help getting
the captaincy Ive been sort of sleuthing around Harry None of the
fellows seem to have picked a candidate yet Theres talk of Crandall
but its only talk What Im wondering is whether it wouldnt be a good
idea to casually suggest Kendalls name to one or two of the football
bunch just offhand you know

I suppose it would Only the fellows mustnt think we want him for
captain It ought to be done mighty carefully

Yes and I guess it would be a good idea to wait until after
tomorrows game and see what happens then If Kendall kicks a couple
of field goals or distinguishes himself any other way perhaps we wont
have to say a word

He wont though answered Harry Just because we want him to he
will get hurt at the beginning of the game and have to be laid off You
see if he doesnt Thats the way things happen

Whos full of fog now laughed Gerald Youre as pessimistic as an
owl And youre all wrong too Something tells me that we are going
to win tomorrow and that Kendall is going to make a blooming hero of
himself Still if he doesnt it will be up to us to start the ball
rolling We might each drop a hint you know Who do you know best on
the team Charlie Merriwell

No Pete or Bert I suppose

Well you go for Bert then You could just say something about its
being pretty near time to think about a new captain and wonder who he
will be Then you could say that you think Kendall would make a pretty
good one See

Yees But say Gerald have you thought how wed feel if they did
make Kendall captain and he didnt turn out to be the right fellow
after all

No because he will be the right fellow Whats the use of considering
things that arent so Dan picked Kendall for the place and Dan
knows The corridor was filling with students and Gerald dropped his
voice I had a letter from him the other day and he particularly
asked about Kendall Come on its nine oclock

Harry groaned What do you suppose we have recitations for he asked
Life would be so much nicer without them




CHAPTER XVI

COTTON WRITES A LETTER


That afternoon the fog changed to a soft drizzle that puffed in from
the Sound on a southwest breeze and cast a pall of gloom and moisture
over the school Luckily there was no outdoor practice scheduled for
the field was soft and slippery and just in condition to produce a crop
of sprains and bruises Instead there was a solid two hours of signal
drill and talk in the gymnasium The plays selected for the morrow
were drawn on the blackboard and explained again by the Coach after
which the players were quizzed on each and afterwards were made to
go through them first at a walk and then at a trot until they went
off smoothly Toward the last the lights had to be turned on and
the players their rubber soles patting the boards moved back and
forth two squads of them with their foreshortened shadows dodging
and leaping about the floor with strange effect The voices of Simms
and Holmes the first high and sharp and the latter like an angry
growl called the signals the centers shot back the balls the poised
players broke into seeming confusion there was the sound of pattering
shoes on the floor of hurried breathing and then quiet again as the
teams reformed quiet broken by the even voice of Coach Payson

Cousins you started too soon Wait until quarter turns Your duty is
to make the play safe If there had been a fumble youd never have got
the ball Try that again please And Burtis keep your head straight
If you turn it you may give away the play Remember that everyone
Dont indicate by a look or movement where the ball is going or where
the attack is to be made Same play Simms

At the edge of the shadow cast by the running track a halfdozen
substitutes watched and awaited their turns With them were Davis
making interminable notes in his book and Andy Ryan the little
redheaded trainer his sharp eyes following the players every
movement Finally it was over and the fellows trooped down the stairs
to the showers the edict Ten oclock bed fellows ringing in their
ears

Meanwhile Gerald was leading a dozen or so scantily attired youths
over the crosscountry course plugging up the slippery hillsides and
splashing through puddles with the rain soaking their running clothes
and squishsquashing in their spiked shoes and all for the glory of
Yardley And although no one knew it far out on the golf links a
solitary figure in the rainswept landscape George Kirk was tramping
doggedly along in the wake of a wee white ball The golfing days were
growing fewer and fewer and although it would be a good six months
before he could lead his warriors against Broadwood again he must miss
no chance to prepare for a victory And this too was for the glory of
Yardley

By supper time the drizzle had turned to a driving rain that beat
against the front windows of the halls and filled the walks with
unexpected puddles into which you walked unseeingly It was what The
Duke sprinting back from the library after suppereven The Duke had
to look up a reference occasionallytermed to himself a dark dank
drooly nicht He reached the entrance to Clarke out of breath and
somewhat damp but his spirits were not affected It took more than
that to affect them Even the fact that authority in the person of
one Edmund Gaddis instructor in English familiarly known as Old
Tige had decreed that The Duke should hand in a theme before Saturday
noon and that Saturday noon was less than seventeen hours away cast
no spell of gloom over his gayety When having reached the head of
the first flight he descried Adler coming along the corridor he
immediately stationed himself against the newel post clapped a hand
to an imaginary sword hilt and scowled silently at the approaching
figure Adler sighting his foe at the same moment placed a quick hand
on his own weapon and hugging the further wall advanced cautiously
with an insolent expression No word was spoken Eyeing each other
intently haughtily they met and passed The weapons were not drawn
Adler circling at a safe distance reached the stairs and with a
last malevolent glare which was met and returned passed from sight
Whereupon The Duke dropped his hand from his sword hilt and proceeded
upstairs three steps at a time Just why the two went through this
procedure they did not know but they always did wherever and whenever
they met Doubtless it added spice to life

Cotton was writing at the study table when The Duke flung open the
door of Number  At sight of his roommate Cotton quickly turned the
written sheet face downward and drew a blotter half over it afterward
pretending to trace figures on the blotter with his pen The Duke
observed him disgustedly

Oh chuck the mystery Cotton I dont want to see what youre
writing Every time anyone comes around you you hide something like a
silly conspirator Why the dickens dont you write something you arent
ashamed of eh

Im not ashamed of anything I write replied Cotton with intense
dignity But I dont want fellows to read my letters do I

You do not Nor does anyone want to read your old letters Ill bet a
dollar and seven cents no one could read em

The Duke had seized a towel and was vigorously mopping the rain from
his face and hair Cotton scowled

If I couldnt write better than you IId use a typewriter

Is that impossible scoffed The Duke tossing the towel aside and
slicking his hair with a pair of military brushes Sweet youth I
wouldst tell thee something an thou willst hearken My name is Lester
S Wellington and the S stands for Spencerian I O Colossal Lump of
Ignorance invented the art of writing

Cotton said Humph in an unflattering tone and gathered up his
writing The Duke feeling better after his burst of confidence
pulled a slip of crumpled paper from a pocket and smoothed it out
It contained the notes written in the library He had started for
his room with his mind made up to sit down at once and compose that
English theme But now he viewed the notes distastefully The virtuous
impulse was dying fast Besides how could a fellow do anything with
Cotton there An English themeespecially to The Dukewas something
requiring ideal conditions of quiet and vast concentration And it was
absolutely impossible to concentrate when Cotton was scratching his pen
or shuffling his feet at the other side of the table Besides there
was still tomorrow morning He would arise early and do the theme
before chapel Ones faculties are always at their best in the early
morning The Duke slipped the notes between the pages of a blue book
and smiled relievedly He even viewed his roommate with a forgiving
smile

Coming over to Oxford he asked

What for growled Cotton not so ready to make up

Why for the massmeeting O Flower of Chivalry

What do I care about the massmeeting inquired Cotton with a scowl
A lot of idiots howling and some more idiots making speeches What
does it amount to

Why you unpatriotic sinner exclaimed The Duke I honestly believe
youd rather see us beaten than not

Were going to be beaten whether I want it or dont Besides
therell be plenty of fellows there to make a noise without me

The Duke viewed him with deep disgust for a moment Finally Cotton
at times I experience a most frantic temptation to kick you out of the
window Isnt that strange Can you explain it

Youd better try it replied the other belligerently

No I shall try to resist answered The Duke shaking his head
gently You just say that so Ill spoil a perfectly good window
and get in trouble I dont think that is very nice of you Cotton
In fact I think it shows a mean spirit No when I do kick you O
Delectable One it will be through the door with the door open

Youyou began Cotton angrily

Dont ask me interrupted The Duke holding up a hand Id like
to oblige you Cotton but I will not kick you out the window You
must try to be reasonable about it Put yourself in my place Cotton
As much as I love you O Joy of My Heart I will not sacrifice a good
window merely to satisfy your selfish whim No no Cotton it must be
the door You must be satisfied with the door Not another word I beg
of you I am adamant

And The Duke smiling sweetly but reprovingly passed out leaving
Cotton sputtering with indignation and rage By the time The Dukes
footsteps had died away in the corridor however his roommates wrath
had wasted to grumblings

Silly fool muttered Cotton Stuckup idiot Thinks hes so beastly
clever does he Huh He caught sight of the paper The Duke had
slipped into the book and he reached across the table and drew it out
Notes eh he murmured For his theme I guess Well he can go and
get some more hes so smart And very deliberately grinning the
while Cotton tore the sheet into tiny pieces and opening the window
let them flutter out Then chuckling he returned to the table
uncovered his letter dipped his pen and began to write again

    And as near as I can find out they wont learn the new signals
    until about Tuesday I guess I can find out what they are Ill
    try anyway If I do Ill let you know right away It looks like
    theyd get licked tomorrow and I hope they do Two or three
    of the fellows are overtrained they say but I dont know if
    its really true Look for a letter Wednesday or Thursday Best
    regards

He didnt sign his name Folding the letter he slipped it into an
envelope and addressed it to William Gibson Esq Broadwood Academy
Greenburg Ct Then putting it into his pocket he slipped quietly
down the stairs and across through the rain to the letterbox in front
of Oxford Although there was no one in sight Cotton took no risks
of being seen and the way in which he extracted the letter from his
pocket and slid it through the slot was a marvel of dexterity Then as
a sudden burst of cheering reached him from upstairs he passed into
the hall and sought the meeting just as in spite of his declaration
to the contrary he had intended to do all along




CHAPTER XVII

A FUMBLE


The morning of the Nordham game dawned gray and cold and cheerless The
rain still continued and water lay in pools along the drive and walks
What the field would be like in the afternoon no one cared to predict
There was talk of canceling the game and rumors to the effect that
Andy Ryan had called on Mr Bendix the court of final appeal in such
cases to ask him to declare the game off were rife about the school
in the morning It was explained that the trainer was afraid of injury
to the players on such a slippery field Perhaps had there not been
such a desire to obtain revenge from Nordham for last years defeat the
contest might have been canceled But it wasnt There was a conference
at eleven oclock attended by Mr Payson Mr Bendix Captain
Merriwell Manager Davis and Andy Ryan and during its progress the
school at large held its breath in painful suspense When the result of
the conference was announced there was both relief and joy In spite
of Andys advice the game was to take place the only alteration of
original plans consisting of a shortening of the playing periods from
fifteen minutes to twelve

Yardley flocked to the field at two oclock clad in raincoats and
rubber hats The attendance from outside the school was naturally
small although perhaps a hundred and fifty or two hundred townsfolk
came up to pick their way across the soggy grass under bobbing
umbrellas and view the game from the watersoaked seats Nordham sent
over some twenty or thirty devoted supporters who managed to make
a large amount of noise considering their number Two First Class
fellows detailed by Gerald on request of Mr Manager Davis stood at
the entrance and watched for the appearance of inquisitive Broadwood
gentlemen None sought admission however which was fortunate since
the guards would have been powerless to exclude them Practice was cut
short today and after one or two dashes about the field and a few
kicks of the wet ball the two teams retired to their respective sides
and the captains met to decide the choice of goals It was raining
steadily but not so hard as during the forenoon and optimistic ones
predicted that the weather would clear before the game was finished
The field was soft and slippery and here and there held shallow pools
of water In the stand Gerald seated between Harry and The Duke was
retelling an old joke called to mind by the condition of the field

You fellows may have heard it he said Its rather a classic

Cut out the apologies begged The Duke Theyre going to start in a
minute

Well once when Pennsylvania and Princeton used to play football
together

That must have been in the dark ages murmured Harry

there was a Thanksgiving Day game in Philadelphia It had snowed
during the night and when it came time to start the game it was
raining and the field was covered with slush two or three inches deep
The Princeton captain won the toss Do we have to play in this fluid
he asked bitterly Of course you do they told him impatiently Come
on now you won the toss which end do you want The Princeton man
looked around over the waste of gray slush and shook his head Well
he said finally I guess well kick with the tide

Thats what were going to do laughed Harry Weve won the toss

Nordham was spreading out over her end of the field and Fales was
trying to make a tee with the soft mud I wonder said Gerald if
he wouldnt like Kirk to drive off for him The whistle blew Fales
stepped forward and the ball took flight Nordham at once tested the
field trying to get a back away around Adlers end but the attempt
was a failure There was no such thing as quick starting today and
the runner was tackled before he had reached his own line Nordham
kicked then and the ball went to midfield Marion tried the center of
the Nordham line and netted two yards Crandall slid off right tackle
for two more and Simms kicked A redstockinged Nordhamite caught the
pigskin near his twenty yards and dodged back to the thirtyfive before
he was downed Then came a forward pass that failed followed by two
attempts at the right of the Yardley breastworks The Red missed her
distance by a scant halffoot and Yardley took the ball away Kendall
secured three yards outside left tackle on a double pass and made
three more through left guard Simms ran back and passed to Cousins
who was tackled where he caught It was first down again Crandall and
Kendall alternating worked the tackles for gains until the ball was
on the Reds twentysixyard line There Simms fumbled the slippery
ball and a Nordham forward fell on it

Nordham kicked on first down getting off a fine long punt that went
over Simms head far down the field The Nordham ends were on him by
the time he had secured the ball and Simms went down in the mud An
exchange of punts secured five yards for Yardley and then Marion banged
through for twelve and laid the oval on the fiftyyard line Another
attempt however failed of gain and Kendall fell back to punt Girard
made a wretched pass and Kendall had to fall on the ball to save it
With twentythree yards to gain Simms sent Kendall back again as if to
kick and himself took the ball through the Nordham center for ten yards
and would have got away for the necessary distance had he not slipped
and fallen Nordham tried a forward pass that netted fifteen yards
and then worked a delayed pass for five more the entire Yardley team
being fooled on the play The whistle blew with the ball in Nordhams
possession on Yardleys twentyfive yards

So far neither team had shown much strength in attack and neither had
reached scoring distance of the opponents goal In weight Nordham
was perceptibly lighter than Yardley while her better speed was
handicapped by the slippery field

In the second period Nordham ripped open the Blue line on two tries for
a first down bringing the ball to the twenty yards An end run was
spoiled and a fake kick with an attack on the center of the line netted
but two yards Then Nordhams fullback retired to the thirtyfive
yards and the quarter knelt in front of him The ball was almost in
front of the goal and it looked as though a score was to follow But
the Blue forwards smashed through in time to spoil the placekick the
ball thumping against Girards upstretched arm and bounding away toward
the side of the field where it was secured by Kendall

From her twentyeight yards the Blue began a series of plays directed
at the tackles that soon worked the ball past the middle of the field
Stark right tackle was drawn back frequently and Marion and the two
halfbacks had their turns The Red team was weakening it seemed
her secondary defense especially making poor work of stopping the
advance On the stand the Yardley supporters were shouting lustily
for a touchdown and it looked as though the Blue was well started
on a triumphant journey With some three or four minutes of the
half remaining and the Red line allowing gains at every attack it
seemed that Yardley might well cross that last white line But near
the thirtyfive yards there was a mixup on signals and Crandall was
thrown for a loss Simms raged and stormed and Kendall took the ball
for a wide end run Across the field he raced protected by fair
interference watching for a chance to turn in and finally just when
it seemed that his chance had come and he had a clear field between him
and the opposing quarterback an intrusive Nordham man dodged by the
interference and made a flying tackle that fairly lifted Kendall off
his feet and hurled him to earth

Away bounded the pigskin A Nordham player foiled a moment before
was in the path of the ball Those who saw the incident declared that
the redstockinged chap hardly had to stretch out his hands that the
ball actually bounced into his arms In any case having got it he
knew what to do Off he went on a wild effort to cover the seventyodd
yards between him and Yardleys goal Behind him the Yardley players
aghast at the sudden turn of fortune trailed in desperate pursuit
Fayette led the pack and for a time it seemed that he might reach the
runner before the last white streak was crossed But twenty yards from
the goal Fayette gave out and was passed by Plant who in turn for a
moment raised Yardley hopes But Plant was heavy and the streak down
the field told on him before he could reach the Nordham runner and the
latter staggered over the line reeled behind a post and fell on top
of the ball in the very middle of the goal subsequently turning calmly
over on his back and losing all interest in events for a minute

The tackle that had dislodged the ball from Kendalls grasp had been
a terrific one and even the most disappointed spectator grudgingly
acknowledged that to have clung to a wet pigskin after such collision
with the ground would have been almost impossible Breathless and
dazed with his left arm filled with tearing pains Kendall climbed
to his feet in time to see the Nordham runner settle into his stride
Doggedly Kendall joined the pursuit but a dozen steps was all he
could manage Having by then reached a nice pool of water he sank down
into it clasped his left wrist with the other hand and came so near
fainting that it almost turned him sick For a moment no one noticed
his collapse Then Pete Girard went to his assistance somewhere a
whistle blew and Andy Ryan the water pail slopping beside him raced
on A big wet sponge was swashed over Kendalls face and he opened his
eyes Girard kneeling across his thighs was pumping his arms and at
every moment the left one hurt excruciatingly Kendall tried his best
to keep his lips tight but in spite of him a moan got by and Andys
eyes flashed hither and thither and his cunning fingers began a quick
search over the boys ribs

Where does it get you demanded Andy

Kendall shook his head Merriwell and some others had come up and
Kendall could hear their hoarse breathing

Can you stand up demanded Andy suspiciously

Kendall doubted it but he nodded IImall right he whispered
Girard and another lifted him and again Kendall winced Andy
watching pounced upon him again

Hold up boys he said quietly Somethings wrong He felt of
Kendalls collarbone working clever fingers like lightning along the
back of his neck Hurt he asked Kendall shook his head Andys
fingers slid down along the left arm his little green eyes watching
Kendalls face sharply The boy held his breath and gritted his teeth
The awful fingers reached the wrist closed

Kendall felt the blood ebbing away from his face already pale but
he returned the trainers gaze unflinchingly Andys fingers stopped
kneading lingered inquiringly at the wrist Then his eyes left
Kendalls and Kendall following the trainers gaze saw a white lump
on the back of his hand

Andy grunted Come off he said

Its nothing Andy really pleaded Kendall II dont even feel
it

For answer Andy laid a compelling hand on his shoulder Sure I know
Tis rather pleasant than otherwise maybe But just the same youll
come along with me Burtis me boy

Payson awaited them on the sideline Dislocated wrist announced
Andy

Sorry Burtis Fayette Fayette Right half and hurry up

I may go in again maynt I Andy begged Kendall as he lowered
himself to the bench

Maybe I dont know Hold your arm out One o you boys put your arms
around his chest Thats it Hold steady now Slowly Andy pulled at
the hand and pressed against the white lump There was a squirmish
gritting sort of jar as the bone fell into place again All right
Hold it so a minute Andy reached into his bag for splints and bandage
just as a shout of satisfaction traveled across the field Kendall
glancing quickly toward the Yardley goal saw the pigskin dropping to
earth beyond the farther upright Nordham had failed at goal

With quick hands Andy wound the bandage The shooting pains had already
gone but there was a dull throbbing ache at the wrist and Kendall
viewed the whiteswathed member scowlingly I wonder he began

What asked Andy as he tied the knot

I wonder if I hurt that before I dropped the ball Andy

Sure you did You likely got it doubled under you when you went down

Did I Thats not so bad then is it I mean there might be more
excuse for fumbling mightnt there

No man on earth would have held the ball after getting that
responded the trainer nodding at the hand Dont bother your head
about it son He fashioned a sling of a broad strip of gauze and
placed the arm in it so that the fingers lay over Kendalls right
chest Keep it so Well have the doctor see it later Times up Get
the blankets ready boys




CHAPTER XVIII

KENDALL GOES BACK


Kendall trotting awkwardly with one arm out of commission followed
the team and substitutes up the hill to the gymnasium Feeling sadly
out of it he found a seat in a corner and watched the others The
rubbers were busy as soon as the doors had swung shut and the air was
already redolent of arnica and witch hazel There was a rush of water
and a babel of voices Andy was busy at his store of rubber anklets and
bandages Fales had twisted his knee and Crandall had a cut over one
eye that gave him a particularly wicked and disreputable appearance
Payson was talking with Captain Merriwell the latter stretched at
full length on a table with a rubber massaging his back Payson was
frowning intently as he talked One by one the fellows came over to ask
Kendall about his injury They all seemed really sorry even Fayette
who had profited by the others misfortune expressed concern in tones
that sounded genuine After awhile the coach began to talk and the
room quieted What he said was not very different from what coaches
have said at such times from the beginning of football He pointed out
mistakes and explained how to avoid them There was no scolding At the
end he said gravely

The school wants you to win today Just keep that in mind Youve
been outplayed so far by a team thats no better than you are not
quite so good I think Youre no more handicapped than they are by
the wet field and wet ball Theres no reason why you cant make a
touchdown in each period fellows But youve got to do better than
you have done Youve got to play together and put more snap into
it Perhaps youve forgotten what Nordham did to you last year Or
perhaps you dont care If you dont care go on playing as youve
been playing If you do care go back there and show them how to play
football

On the way back Payson sought Kendall Im sorry you got hurt
Burtis he said kindly Take care of that wrist though and well
have you playing next week Andy says he will have you in shape by
then He nodded and moved ahead

Next week muttered Kendall That means I dont get back today I
could though if it wasnt for this silly sling around my neck He
removed his hand and lowered it It began to hurt as the blood flowed
down into it and Kendall scowled Gee but its mean luck First
I went and fumbled the ball and they scored a touchdown and then I
had to bust my wrist and cant play any more He worked his fingers
experimentally They hurt some but he decided that he could manage to
hold a ball with them in spite of the splints if theyd only give him a
chance He looked about for Andy Ryan as they trotted on to the field
to the long cheers of the stand The trainer was busy and Kendall
waited until he was for an instant alone Then

Andy you said I could go back he charged

Go back Do you mean play football

Kendall nodded

I said that did I Andy grinned Was I snoring at the time

You know you werent answered Kendall indignantly And you did say
maybe I could

Maybe Sure I said maybe Burtis But what would you be doing out
there with one arm in a sling

I dont need to keep it in a sling Andy

You dont eh Listen son Do you keep your hand where I put it and
take care of it Then maybe you can play next week If you dont

Maybe gasped Kendall in dismay Isis there any doubt of it

There is replied Andy dryly All ready men

Kendall staring blankly before him turned to find a seat on the
bench and heard his name called Gerald was leaning across the barrier
with an anxious countenance

What did you do he called Break anything

Dislocated answered Kendall tapping the bandaged wrist He moved
nearer to Gerald They say I cant play any more today andand

Of course you cant agreed Gerald frowningly Youve got to take
care of it Isnt it mean luck Kendall One might have thought that
it was Gerald who had injured himself instead of Kendall The latter
nodded gloomingly waved his well hand and found a seat between Metz
and Jackson Metz was not very cheerful company these days since
he had but lately been deposed from right end in favor of Adler and
was not yet viewing the matter philosophically Jackson who was a
substitute guard a big rawboned chap with lantern jaws and eyebrows
that met companionably above his nose glanced at Kendalls injury and
asked laconically

Broke Burtis

No just a dislocation

Too bad taint broke They say breaks heal quickern dislocations

My but youre a cheerful comforter muttered Kendall as he turned
to watch the kickoff Merriwell had elected to give that honor to
Nordham There was no advantage attached to the possession of either
end of the field today for there was no wind The rain still
descended but it was more like a heavy mist now Nordham booted the
ball far down the field and Simms got it near his own tenyard line
and by a wonderful effort that brought the onlookers to their feet
carried it past midfield By that time the Yardley back had dodged and
fought his way past the entire Nordham team save its quarter and seemed
well on his way for a touchdown Having outstripped his interference
Simms ran directly at the Reds quarterback at full speed But that
youth was not to be fooled He approached Simms slowly and cautiously
Just as the runner swerved to his left the redlegged player made a
diving plunge at Simms and brought him down the two sliding through
mud and water for yards after the tackle

Yardley hammered the center for small gain and then slid off the
tackles and made her distance A fumble was recovered and an end run
lost ground Simms tried a quarterback kick and Nordham got the ball
near her thirty yards An exchange of punts gave no advantage to either
side and Nordham tried the Yardley center and squeezed through for two
short gains Crandall got the punt and trailed off twentyodd yards
before he was pulled down Yardley went back to her former tactics of
direct attack plugging the guards and tackles and now and then trying
a wide end run In this manner the ball was carried down to Nordhams
twentythreeyard line Marion got through for three Crandall made
five on a skintackle play and the pigskin rested squarely on the
fifteenyard line There was a pause here Simms and Merriwell holding
a consultation Kendall guessed that they were discussing the chances
of making that needed two yards To try a field goal then seemed absurd

Finally Fales dropped out of the line and went back as though to kick
and although there were one or two cries of Fake Nordham seemed
pretty well convinced that a tryatgoal was to be the play She pulled
her wings in a little and made ready to break through This left the
Yardley ends free and Kendall noting the fact wondered whether Simms
meant to chance a forward pass The ball went back to Fales and the
big guard stepped forward and swung his long leg The Nordham forwards
came crashing through with upstretched arms leaping and stumbling
Fales however had not kicked With the nearest Nordham players almost
upon him he sidestepped and hurled the ball straight over the center
of the line toward where Cousins awaited it There was an instant of
suspense of wild scrambling on the part of the defenders and then
the ball aimed too high went over Cousins head struck an upright
of the goal and bounded back A dozen bodies threw themselves after
it But under the rules it went to Nordham for a touchback and a groan
of disappointment arose from the stand Nordham kicked from behind her
goal line and Crandall made the catch on Yardleys fortythree yards
From there Yardley hammered out two yards and then the whistle blew for
the end of the third period

As the players separated to don their blankets and change positions
Coach Payson strode over to Andy Ryan Kendall watching saw the
trainer swing around and look at him Paysons gaze followed Kendalls
heart leaped into his throat For a moment the two talked Once Andy
shook his head slowly Once he shrugged his shoulders Then Payson was
calling

Burtis

Kendall sprang from the bench and hurried to the sideline

Do you think you can go in and kick if you have a chance asked the
coach hurriedly If youre to go in at all Ive got to put you in now
You may tell Simms not to use you except for kicking

Yes sir

Take your sling off said Andy but keep your arm up all you can
And keep out of scrimmage too

Yes you neednt rough it up any Burtis All I want you to do is punt
when necessary and if we get inside their thirty yards try a goal
unless Simms is pretty certain of making a touchdown You tell him
that Tell him hes to use you only when necessary and to try for a
fieldgoal inside their thirty yards unless hes sure he can make it by
rushing Send Fayette out Go ahead

The teams were already forming at the farther end of the field as
Kendall sped on A cheer burst forth from the stand and then another
as Brinspool raced after Kendall to relieve Marion Kendall made for
the referee

Right half he panted Youre off Fayette Let me have your
headguard Then he drew Simms aside and whispered the instructions
Captain Merriwell joined them and listened Neither he nor Simms seemed
very well pleased

A goal from field wont do much good muttered Simms Well have to
have two to even tie the game

Hed better have left Fayette in said Merriwell Well

Ready Yardley

All ready sir Simms trotted to his place Brinspool snatched
Marions headguard and sent that youth dejectedly off The whistle
blew




CHAPTER XIX




Nordham had made three changes one in her line and two in her
backfield With only twelve minutes left to play she was hoping to
stave off a Yardley score and when on the second play Brinspool
dropped the ball and she recovered it on her fortyyard line she
kicked on first down and sent the pigskin twenty yards into the Blues
territory Undismayed Yardley took up the journey again Nordham
put all her skill into defensive playing and twice Yardley made
her distance on the third down only by inches Then the middle line
was crossed Crandall swung far around right end for a sevenyard
gain and Brinspool banged his way through right guard for two more
Plant was drawn back and made four yards off left tackle Then Simms
concentrated the attack on the left of the Nordham line and found a
weak place at guard But the Reds secondary defense played fiercely
and stopped the runners almost as soon as they were through Brinspool
had found his pace however and went through time and again for
two and threeyard gains Twice play was stopped while the distance was
measured but each time the Blue had an inch or two to spare Then the
thirtyyard line was reached and Kendall who all this time had never
once been given the ball and had done no more than interfere for the
runner observed Simms anxiously But that youth was not ready to try
a fieldgoal yet Plant and Brinspool hammered the left guard and slid
off the left tackle Crandall made a slight gain on an end run and the
twentyyard line was under foot But then Nordham desperate made a
stand Crandall sliced through between right guard and tackle for two
yards and Brinspool made four straight through center But with four to
go on the third down the prospect didnt look encouraging Merriwell
whispered to Simms and Simms nodded

Kick formation Burtis back Hold that line fellows

Kendall trotted back to the thirty yards and the defense for the kicker
grouped in front Whether he could catch the pass Kendall didnt know
That splinted hand seemed terribly awkward to him But when the ball
came back breast high his hands closed upon it automatically and he
stepped forward dropped it swung and sent it high and straight over
the bar

A burst of cheering swept across the field and Crandall was patting
him on the back One more like that Kendall and well have em
tied he shouted

Seven minutes remained as Nordham brought out the ball and lined up
for a scrimmage Two tries netted her six yards and then again she
punted This time the ball went out at the fiftyfiveyard line and
there was no chance to run it back Yardley started again toward the
Reds goal with an end run by Simms that tore off twelve yards Then
Crandall taking the ball on a delayed pass swung around the left
end of the Reds line and secured nearly fifteen yards before he was
brought down from behind In the tackle his knee was badly wrenched
and although he got into the next play his usefulness for that
day was at an end and Greene took his place Payson also seized the
opportunity to relieve Girard and Captain Merriwell Best and McKesson
going in Plant plowed through for four and Greene made three Kendall
by this time forgetting his injured hand was in every play and it
was after Brinspool had staggered around right tackle for enough to
make the distance with Kendall putting out the opposing end that the
latter had cause to remember that left wrist Brinspool following him
closely lurched against him as he staggered by and the full weight
of the big fellow came against that injured arm For an instant Kendall
wanted to crumple up on the soggy turf and forget everything But he
didnt and the pain soon passed

A fumble by Greene on the next play set them back five yards Kendall
falling on the ball in a puddle just ahead of a frantic Nordham tackle
Brinspool failed to gain at center Plant got four yards through the
right side and with six to gain Kendall punted By this time the
ball was soaked through to the rubber and was pretty dead and the
punt carried only thirty yards The result was that the Nordham quarter
had to run forward for it and just as he reached it the treacherous
ground took a hand in affairs The pigskin went through his arms as
he recovered his stride bounded along the wet turf throwing a spray
behind it and then rolled toward the sideline Adler who had been
put out of the running by a Nordham back had got to his feet again
and was coming down fast The other Yardley end Cousins had overrun
Adler without easing his pace swung sharply toward the right
slipped recovered himself and dived a good ten feet for the ball just
as a Nordham halfback raced by The two came together and the water
spouted as they rolled in the mud But Adler had the ball and it was
down on Nordhams twentyeight yards and the Yardley supporters who
had by this time abandoned the stand and were clustered deep along the
rope set up a triumphant frenzied shout

Touchdown Touchdown Touchdown they clamored

Holmes raced on with waving hand Quarter sir he called Youre
off Simms

Oh get out of here snapped Simms

Paysons orders answered Holmes

Youre delaying the game Yardley came the warning Simms looked at
Holmes indecisively Then his head went down and he walked away

Now then fellows called Holmes Get into it Youre not playing
Brace up Stark brace up Lets put this over in six plays fellows

Brinspool got a yard and a half through center and Greene followed with
four yards past left tackle Holmes darted through right guard for the
distance squirming and fighting

First down The referee waved his arm to the linesmen

Line up quick roared Holmes Over with it Lets try their left
fellows

And Holmes actually sent Greene against the left wing but gained less
than a yard Brinspool tried the other side and got past for four

Kick formation Burtis back Hold hard now

But the ball went to Holmes and he passed to Brinspool and the big
fullback charged into the line like a steam engine and went through
with half the Nordham team hanging about him There was an anxious
moment while the ball was hunted but when it came to light it lay a
good two feet beyond the tenth yard Only nine yards away was the goal
line Across the trampled field the Yardley supporters were shouting
incessantly Holmes raised an imploring hand and comparative quiet
fell The Nordham captain was begging and scolding up and down his line

Now stop em men Dont give em another foot Throw em back Into
it hard and watch the ball

Holmes barked his signals Kendall dashed at the guardtackle hole on
the left Brinspool followed him Greene darted across took the ball
at a handpass and followed by Holmes squirmed between guard and
tackle on the other side for two yards Seven yards to go

Kick formation Burtis back Now hold them fellows

Block this kick shouted the Nordham captain

Holmes shouted his signals

Fake yelled the Reds captain Watch it Watch it

And a fake it was the pigskin going to Plant who had dropped back
of the line The tackle swung to the left and darted at the opposite
tackle But Nordham was there and he went down as though he had run
against a wall

Get up Get up

Thats the way to hold em Weve got em now They dont dare to
kick

Third down Six to go

Line up fellows Youve got to put it over Get down there Best
Kick formation Burtis

But Holmes paused for Kendall was whispering to him

A field goal will only tie it Holmes said Kendall eagerly Theyre
looking for a kick Let me try a run around the left end Their ends
are away in I can do it Fake a kick Holmes and let me try it

For an instant Holmes hesitated Then with a flash in his eyes All
right But Ill get the dickens if we lose the ball Burtis Youve got
to make it go remember

I will answered Kendall grimly

Kick formation Burtis back Do your best fellows Remember last
year Then came the signals and Kendall saw the sudden look of
surprise in Greenes face as he shifted a few inches nearer the play
Cousins edged out a step the opposing end eyeing him doubtfully Then
Best shot the ball back and Kendall standing near the twentyyard
line caught it Snuggling it close in his injured elbow he darted
to the left Then the field was in movement the two teams racing
between him and the goal Luckily the Yardley line had held firmly and
in the second between his catching of the ball and the discovery of
the play by the opponents Kendall had gained three good strides The
interference formed a moving wall between him and the pursuit as he
pounded across the slippery turf The only thing he feared was to miss
his footing

In In shrieked Holmes sending a Nordham man sprawling and
Kendall swinging to the right made for the goalline A redsleeved
figure sprang in front of him and Kendalls right arm went out there
was a shock and the red sleeves slipped from view One more white line
passed under his feet The air was filled with shouts One of his own
men stumbled into his path and went down Kendall sprang over him
slipped found his stride again and looked into the wild wide eyes of
the Nordham quarter Out went the straight arm again but the quarter
darted aside and sprang His hands clutched at Kendalls hips as the
latter pivoted The quarters hands slid from the slippery rainsoaked
canvas and closed like a vise about one leg Kendall gasping for
breath struggled on that dead weight sliding behind him He had lost
all sense of location and had no idea how near to the goalline he
was His only thought was to go on and on somehow as long as they
would let him Then a long red arm shot across his chest a body banged
against him and he fell to one knee clutching the ball desperately
with both hands He struggled to rise again felt himself being pulled
backward resisted to the limit of his strength and finally squirmed
forward burying his face in the cold wet grass just as the whistle
shrilled

Someone pulled him over onto his back and wrested the ball away from
him For a moment with closed eyes he fought for breath Then
conscious of a numbing pain in one arm and of a sound that beat upon
his ears like breakers on a beach he opened his eyes The first thing
he saw was a shock of red hair then something brown and dripping and
when the sponge was gone leaving him gasping and halfblinded a
whitepainted post so near that he could have stretched out his arm and
touched it Slowly his gaze traveled up the post until it found a bar
set at right angles with it He smiled satisfiedly Itsover isnt
it he asked weakly

A yard over answered Andys voice And now youll come off

No I must kick the goal Kendall demurred

Here boys get him out of this was Andys reply and Kendall found
himself being lifted to his feet

All right he muttered I can walk Let me go you fellows

But when they let him go he staggered and reeled and Andy had to hold
him up After that he went off to the bench quite docilely between two
substitutes regarding the faces that forever got in his way faces
with blazing eyes and wideopen mouths through a haze of perplexity
Somehow there was a great deal of noise going on

Presently blanketed his arm once more in a sling he was leaning back
against the stand quite satisfied with the world From where he sat
quite alone save for Andy he could see only the backs of the crowd a
crowd gone suddenly silent He knew then that someone probably Fales
was preparing to try a goal and would have got up and gone to see had
not Andy pushed him gently back into his seat

Be easy cant you he grumbled How do you think that wrist is
going to get well if you dont take care of it If Id had my way youd
never gone back there today Its a wonder you didnt snap it out
again

All right Andy replied Kendall happily I just wanted to see if
wed get the goal

No matter if we do or we dont said Andy snapping his bag shut We
beat em anyway dont we

Yes butbut what is the score

Nine to six and thats good enough How do you feel

Oh Im all right feeling fine Nine to

No goal someone cried and No goal ran the verdict as the throng
broke up to follow the ball back to the center of the field

Who kicked asked Kendall as Jensen substitute tackle came by
trailing his blanket in the mud

Fales Missed it by only a foot I guess That was a great run
Burtis

Can you walk all right asked Andy Kendall got to his feet and tried
it finding that the dizziness was gone Then go on up before the
crowd starts directed the trainer Get your duds off and take a hot
tub Ill look after you when I come up

Couldnt I see the rest of the game begged Kendall

You could not answered Andy shortly Do as I tell you to do for
once First thing you know them howling hyenas will be wanting to lug
you around on their shoulders and youll get hurt again Off with you
now Go slow but keep going

All right Will you find my sweater for me

I will Get out

So Kendall feeling rather as though he had had a skyscraper fall on
him and had been kicked by a mule trudged out and up the path to
the gymnasium the clamor of shouts and cheers and the piping of the
whistle lessening as he went Halfway to the gymnasium warned by a
sudden burst of triumphant cheering he turned and looked back They
were diving under the ropes and flooding onto the field The game was
over Kendall smiling blissfully hurried on




CHAPTER XX

HARRY REMEMBERS


    Broadwood had a little team
       It couldnt play at all
     And evry time it tried to pass
       It dropped the blooming ball
     The ball the ball the ball the ball
       It dropped the blooming ball

    It tried to play with Yardley once
       And oh it was a shame
     To see the way old Yardley went
       And took away that game
     The game the game the game the game
       And took away the game

Some range what asked The Duke slapping Harry Merrow on the
shoulder as they clattered up the last flight in Clarke Honestly
I dont see how grand operas got along all these years without me
The game the game the game the game And took away the gaame
Get that chord Kind of bad what Sometimes I have to pity Caruso and
Scotti old man

Why they dont have to hear you do they asked Harry innocently
as The Duke flung open the portal of Number 

Good thing for them they cant Theyd swallow a couple of solos and
commit suicide Sit down and be miserable For once that Fido of mine
isnt here

That what asked Harry mystified

Pardon me I should have said fidus fidus Achates Get me Honestly
old man I dont know how Im going to go on living with him Here it
is only the middle of November and Im worn to a string My health is
giving way under the strain If I was only certain about one thing

Whats that asked the other as The Duke paused thoughtfully

Whether hes a skink or a bombyx If I knew that Id be able to get on
better

What the dickens is aa skink

A skink Well its something like a grus only not nearly so
intelligent

Youre a silly chump laughed Harry

Worse than that O Discerning One Im crazy absolutely crazy So
would you be if you had to live with Cotton Look at that table See
the mess Its always like that I personally am naturally neat and
tidy Merrow but Cottonwell see for yourself Hehe annoys me

Things do look a bit messy acknowledged Harry

Messy My word Messy say you Thats no name for it It takes half
my time keeping this place picked up Well lets forget my troubles
and talk about yours

I havent any I guess Except that Kilts is down on me just at
present and Im having a bad time with math

Well you heard about me didnt you Had a terrible fallingout
with Old Tige he got quitequite insulting Saturday You see
Ierneglected to hand in a theme and he said Id have to do it
by Saturday noon And I really meant to because of course he was
quite within his rights you know So Friday evening I went over to
the library and worked and worked and delved and delved in thethe
musty archives getting notes for one of the nicest little themes you
ever saw Oh I must have worked for ten or fifteen minutes Armed
with my notes I returned here fully intending to sport my oak as
we say in dear old England and do that theme But here was Cotton
scratching away with his old pen and shuffling his silly feet and
making noises in his throat It was quite impossible to write a theme
under such circumstances So Iwell I didnt Says I to myself I
will arise betimes in the morning and do it Which I did that is
fairly betimes But where were my notes I ask you Merrow as man to
man where were my notes Flown Decamped Utterly vanished So as
there was no time to get more notes I started in to write a theme on
the simple little subject of Walter Scott It was awell a hurried
effort and as it turned out I got Sir Walter mixed up in my mind
with Thackeray Result disapproval on the part of Mr Edmund Gaddis
disapproval and hard words I was patient with him Merrow but it was
difficult for he said things no gentleman should say to another We
partedwell scarcely friends And Ive got two themes now hanging
over my head instead of one And only until tomorrow evening to do
them The Duke sighed and shook his head But such is life

Too bad murmured Harry sympathetically And the dickens of it is
that this is no time to push a fellows nose to the grindstone No
fellow can do decent work just before the Broadwood game it isnt fair
to expect it

I wish that silly game was over with said The Duke fervently
Honest I get so excited and nervous and stirred up about it youd
think I was going to play quarterback By the way Duffeyhe rooms
with Bert Simms you knowDuffey says Bert is all up in the air over
the game doesnt sleep for calling signals all night and cant eat

Harry looked incredulous Why I saw Simms this morning and talked to
him and he seemed as untroubled as you please

That so Well its only what I heard How is Burtiss arm getting on
I havent seen him since Sunday

All right Theyre having a leather cuff made thats to fit right over
the wrist I didnt know a simple dislocation could be so bad

Whats the difference between a dislocation and a sprain demanded
The Duke

Harry shook his head I dont know I suppose that when you sprain
your ankle you just pull the tendons dont you or the ligaments And
when you dislocate it you throw the bone out of joint

Im glad we dont have to take an exam in physiology right now said
The Duke

Yes lucky for us laughed Harry They say the trouble with
Kendalls wrist is that hes likely to dislocate it again very easily
if he isnt careful Payson has let him off practice for the rest of
the week Gerald says

Good stuff After the way he played Saturday theyd ought to let him
do as he pleases I certainly thought they had us beaten there for a
while

Me too What do you think about Broadwood Think we have any show
Duke

If Payson plays the right sort of game yes If he keeps those heavy
beefeaters eternally on the jump by hitting their ends we may tire
them out enough to get within kicking distance When we do we want to
let Burtis do the rest for well never get a touchdown by straight
lineplunging Did you see the score they rolled up on Forest Hill

Harry nodded Twentyseven to six Forest Hill scored though

On a forward pass that ought never to have worked They can say what
they like about Broadwood being fast and maybe they are fast for their
weight but they cant be fast enough to stand a running game very
long Payson ought to send our backs around their ends try forward
passes and all his bundle of tricks Merrow Just plain oldfashioned
football wont make a dent in that team

Thats what I think And they say hes got a lot of good plays outside
tackles But the trouble is that our own team isnt so allfired fast
Duke

Its the slowest Yardley team I ever saw replied The Duke If
Payson doesnt get some jump and ginger into it between now and
Saturday were goners

And as this is Tuesday and there wasnt much jump yesterday I guess
we are

Oh you cant tell by yesterday Mondays always a bad day There
ought to be a difference by tomorrow though Hes got nothing to do
except put pep into them and teach the new signals as I understand it
I suppose theyre learning signals today and thats why practice is
secret eh

I suppose so Tomorrows is to be secret too I hear The only time
well see them in action again before the game will be Thursday Oh
well well hope for the best

And fear the worst By the way I understand theres talk of making
Burtis captain next year

What exclaimed Harry Who says so

Well it seems to interest you Why I dont know just where I heard
it someone said something about it yesterday said the players had
been talking about it since Saturdays game I suppose Burtis made
rather a hit with them Saturday

He made a hit with all of us I guess It was mighty plucky to make
that touchdown with his wrist all banged up I wish they would give
him the captaincy

Well I dont know Yes Id like him to have it if he wants it
because I think hes a mighty nice straight sort But whether hes got
the stuff in him that leaders are made of

I know Ive wondered about that myself And heres what Ive
concluded Duke Ive concluded that Kendall Burtis is the sort of chap
who doesnt show goods until theyre called for I mean that while he
seems very quiet and easygoing and not especially brilliant just put
responsibility on him and he sort of blazes up See what I mean

I get you O Solomon I guess youre right too Look at Saturday He
was the man of the hour then wasnt he And anyhow hes as promising
as any of the other fellows who are eligible Goodness knows Pete
Girard or Fales wouldnt make a captain Howard Crandall might do Its
too bad Holmes isnt going to be with us another year

Yes hed make a good one Hello I didnt know you were interested in
postage stamps Duke Harry had taken a yellow covered pamphlet from
the table and was reading the inscription on it Parkinsons Bulletin
for NovemberRare Stamps for Collectors Stamps used to be a hobby
of mine Ive got a couple of thousand of them at home

That isnt mine thats Cottons He gets more truck like that than
you can shake a stick at He collects the foolish things he says
Got me cornered one night and babbled about cancellations and
watermarks and perforations until I had the earache He says
Say whats the matter with you Feel ill do you

Wait replied Harry sharply He was staring intently scowlingly at
the window Suddenly his face cleared and he gave a laugh of triumph
Ive got him he cried Ive got him

Hooray Who have you got

Cotton

You may keep him declared The Duke with enthusiasm And I dont
care what you do with him

Look here exclaimed Harry eagerly Do you remember some time ago my
saying I was certain sure Id seen Cotton before somewhere

The Duke shook his head doubtfully I dont remember Maybe Well

I was positive Id seen him even talked to him It bothered me a lot
I used to stare at him in class and cudgel my brains about it but I
couldnt place him But I was right all the time and this gave me the
clue He tapped the stamp catalogue on his knee And when you said
he was a stamp collector it all came back to me like a flash

Well go on where did you meet him

Do you remember two years ago when some of the fellows went to
Broadwood one night and put a sign on the campus

Sure

Well I dont know whether you ever knew who the fellows were but I
did And one day I got a letter from a fellow named Charles Cotton at
Broadwood

The Duke whistled

asking me to exchange stamps with him duplicates you know We
arranged a meeting in Greenburg at Wallaces and we got together
there and chinned awhile I think we made one or two swaps but I dont
remember for certain Anyway it turned out that what Cotton really
wanted was to find out the names of the fellows who had played the
trick on Broadwood You remember how mad they were over there Well
Cotton had a stampit was a blue Cape of Good Hopethat I wanted
terribly I offered him a lot of revenues for ithe was rather keen
on revenuesbut he wouldnt let go wanted four or five dollars cash
I think Finally though he as much as said that if Id tell him the
names of the fellows who had been at Broadwood that night hed make me
a present of the stamp But I got suspicious and finally went away You
know they did learn who one of the fellows was Harry paused darting
a doubtful glance at The Duke

The latter nodded I remember You had a grouch with Thompson and
squealed on him If Id been Thompson Id have broken your neck

I deserved it replied Harry I must have been an awful little brute
then But I didnt realize what I was doing and I was good and sorry
for it afterward Duke

The Duke nodded again We always are when its too late But never
mind about that You and Thompson made it up all right So that was
Cotton was it By Jove I can well believe it Its just the sort of
thing I could imagine him doing If I wanted a piece of dirty work
done Merrow Id ask Cotton to do it Thats the way hes impressed me
all along And to think that Ive got to have him on my hands the rest
of the year

But why do you suppose he doesnt own up to having been at Broadwood
two years ago

Probably ashamed of it Maybe he left under a cloud Its a fair wager
he did too Im blessed if Im going to have him in here with me
Merrow He will have to change his room If he wont Ill make it so
hot for him he wont want to stay here You dont mind if I make use of
what youve told me

Nno I suppose not I dont want to make trouble for the fellow of
course As long as he behaves himself here

You dont have to put up with him all day growled The Duke I can
be as charitable as the next chap but charity begins at home and I
dont see why Im required to room with a fellow like Cotton I hate a
sneak anyway

Maybe I oughtnt to have said anything doubted Harry but when it
came to me who he was I couldnt help blurting it out Funny I didnt
remember him before His face was so familiar all the time that it
worried me to death I seemed to be always on the point of remembering
but never did

Im going to find out why he left Broadwood said The Duke
resolutely I know a chap over thereBilly DeemerIll write and
tell him to let me know

Well I wouldnt tell it around said Harry After all Cotton never
did anything to me

Hes never done anything to me either replied The Duke grimly
and Im going to see that he never has a chance to All I want is to
get him out of here After that he can do as he pleases Ill write to
Billy this evening Lets get out of doors Merrow By Jove do you
know its almost four Lets walk over to the gym and see the team come
in




CHAPTER XXI

KENDALL MAKES A SPEECH


Yardley was in the final throes of excitement an excitement that
approached the border of hysteria as Saturday drew nearer and nearer
Rumors of all kinds filled the air Furniss Broadwoods clever
leftend who it was generally agreed would cause more trouble to
Yardleys endrunning game than any other member of the rival team
was down with mumps and wouldnt be able to play Furniss was not down
with mumps at least not that Furniss it was a younger brother in
the Junior Class who was ill Broadwood had gone all to pieces after
the Forest Hill game had played too hard and was in the middle of an
awful slump Broadwood had showed up better at practice on Wednesday
than any day all season Simms was a nervous wreck and wouldnt begin
the game Saturday Simms never felt better in his life and was as cool
as a cucumber Burtis was out of the game inflammation having set in
in his broken wrist Burtiss injury was doing finely and he would at
least start the game for Yardley Stark was having trouble with the
Office and might not be allowed to play against Broadwood his case
was to come up at faculty meeting Friday night Stark was all square
with the faculty and anyone who said otherwise didnt know what he was
talking about

And so it went one rumor crowding on the heels of another until it
took a good part of ones time keeping up with the gossip Tuesdays
practice was held in secret and so was Wednesdays Most of the
time was devoted to familiarizing the team with the new signals and
smoothing out the plays to be used on Saturday Those two days were
hard ones and everyone was kept on the jump every minute The actual
scrimmage was short and often interrupted On Wednesday night there was
a signal drill in the gymnasium The doors were closed more as a matter
of habit than anything else since it was a well understood thing that
none save the team the coaches and trainer were to enter Consequently
when toward the end of the blackboard instruction Manager Davis
suddenly sprinted across the floor and up the stairs to the running
track and spent ten minutes poking around in corners for spies he was
well laughed at

But I did see him protested Perky excitedly I saw his head right
up there at the curve of the balcony Had some sort of a cap on and he
was peeking over the railing

You imagined it said Merriwell Anyhow if you did see someone
where the dickens did he get to

Davis couldnt answer that though and finally he acknowledged that he
might have been mistaken that since the Gibson affair he had had spies
on the brain so to speak

The Duke was in the throes of composition that evening having at
last settled down to the writing of the themes when Cotton who had
disappeared a halfhour before with a vague mention of the library
returned unostentatiously with a book The Duke glanced up incuriously
his mind on his work favored Cotton with a brief and somewhat hostile
stare and was in the act of returning his gaze to the paper before him
when a detail of the others attire caught his eye

Did you know youd torn your coat there at the pocket he asked

Cotton pulled his coat quickly around and looked at the rip

Yes II did that this morning he answered carelessly I caught it
on a door knob

But The Duke was already immersed again in his labor scowling at the
sheet and muttering as he wrote

The next day the janitor found a small round window in an alcove off
the runningtrack in the gymnasium swinging open Not having heard of
Daviss hallucination however he merely fastened it again and thought
nothing of it

The weather turned mild on Thursday and when in the afternoon the team
held open practice and the school lined the ropes and cheered and sang
for a full halfhour the warm sunlight and gentle southerly breeze
suggested baseball rather than football Later the fellows crowded
about the front of the gymnasium and cheered some more cheered every
member of the team individually cheered Coach Payson and Andy Ryan
and Manager Davis and the two rubbers and cheered long and loud and
repeatedly for Yardley Yardley YARDLEY

In the evening there was a grand massmeeting the supreme gathering
of the season with the whole team seated about the platform and the
musical clubs grouped behind them with Mr Payson and Mr Collins and
Mr Bendix for guests of honor and Andy Ryan peeping out from a corner
and with the President of the First Class Mr Gerald Pennimore acting
as master of ceremonies The Assembly Hall was filled long before the
hour set for the meeting The audience was in high feather and while
it waited for the proceedings to formally commence it sang and cheered
and stamped and indulged in mild roughhouse to its hearts content

Promptly at seventhirty the team and the musical clubs filed on to
the platform followed by the head coach and the faculty members and
Gerald held up a hand for silence As the fellows were busily cheering
the players Gerald had to stand there patiently several minutes before
he could make himself heard Even then he had to wait while a cheer was
given for Pennimore fellows And make it good

Geralds address was short and earnest He asked for the loyal support
of the team whether in victory or defeat and introduced Mr Collins
The Assistant Principal trim and smiling said about what he usually
said on such occasions was duly applauded and yielded to Captain
Merriwell Merriwell was very earnest but not being a fluent speaker
made poor going and relied more on repetition than variety However
the spirit of his discourse met with enthusiastic approval and after
he had returned to his seat it was some time before Coach Payson found
a chance to have his say The coach started out in a rather jocular
mood and told two or three stories that set the audience shouting
with laughter In the end however with a sudden change to gravity
he said Id like to be able this evening to assure you all that we
are going to win on Saturday fellows but I cant Frankly to my mind
this years contest is more in doubt than any contest for two years
I dont know whether well win or lose fellows Broadwood has a far
better team than she had last year Shes farther advanced is playing
together well and is powerful In weight she has the better of us So
far her record beats ours On the other hand we have a team that has
not yet played as well as it is able to play

A shout of approval broke forth

and a team that has strong possibilities It isnt a great team
today judged by Yardley standards but it may be a great team on
Saturday Its a wellrounded team a team of hardworking willing
players every one of whom is ready to do his utmostand a little
morefor the school the day after tomorrow And now its up to the
school to help the team fellows I want you all to believe in it to
stand back of it to encourage it by thought and action every minute
between now and the last whistle on Saturday Cheers Were going
to play the game on foreign soil so to speak but whatever handicap
that proves to us can be offset by your support During the game let
the team know that youre there and right with them all the time Dont
cheer just to make a noise and dont cheer just to rattle the other
fellow but cheer because you want your team to win and want to tell
them so And dont stop cheering if the luck goes against them If
they find themselves losing theyll play all the harder Do the same
fellows if the team gets in a hole cheer all the harderuntil its
out

The applause was so loud and prolonged that the coach had to wait a
minute before he could go on

I guess thats about all I have to say I want to thank you all on
my behalf just as Captain Merriwell has thanked you on behalf of
the team for the way youve stood behind me all the season just as
youve stood behind me so many seasons previous Its a great thing
for a coach to feel that the school has confidence in him There are
always moments of discouragement and at such moments the loyalty of
the school is what helps most Saturday will show whether our team is a
great team or merely a good team fellows But whether we win or lose
it will still be the team just the same

In the midst of the cheering that followed the Banjo and Mandolin
Club started Fighting for Old Yardley and the Glee Club took it up
and presently the whole hall was singing

    All together Cheer on cheer
       Now were charging down the field
     See how Broadwood pales with fear
       Knowing we will never yield
     Wave on high your banner blue
       Cheer for comrades staunch and true
     We are here to die or do
       Fighting for old Yardley

The second verse followed and by this time the instruments were quite
drowned out by the voices that roared the words of the song At the
end Gerald arose and with upheld hand smilingly begged silence
When finally the appeal was heeded he called on Mr Bendix and
the Physical Instructor made a rather dry little speech fortunately
as brief as dry Then someone called Simms We want Simms and the
meeting took up the cry with laughter and approval Simms very red
of face shook his head in grinning embarrassment but the demand
increased and Gerald went across and held out his hand to the
quarter Simms however thrust his own hands in his pockets and shook
his head vehemently The meeting laughed but persisted Gerald
was seen to bend down and speak to Simms and at last the quarter
rather indignantly jumped up and strode to the front of the platform
The shouts died suddenly and a couple of hundred of smiling faces
confronted him

I cant make a speech and you fellows know it said Simms
accusingly But Pennimore says Ive got to say something to shut you
up So Ill just say that if you make half as much noise Saturday when
you cheer as you have tonight ragging me we cant help winning

Simms nodded and strode back to his chair while the audience laughed
and cheered and stamped Then someone demanded Andy We want Andy
Ryan and eventually Andy had to stand up at the back of the platform
and make a bow But the cries of Speech Andy Speech fell on deaf
ears The Glee Club leader consulted with the leader of the Banjo and
Mandolin Club while the turmoil continued and the musicians began to
pick at their instruments But evidently the meeting was not yet ready
for songs We want more speeches declared a voice in front Aaay
More speeches agreed the hall at large Feet began to stamp in time
to the refrain Speeches speeches we want speeches Speeches
speeches we want speeches Suddenly a voice at the left of the room
and it sounded a lot like Harry Merrows cried Burtis Burtis We
want Burtis

A howl of approval thundered forth The clamor took on new strength
Burtis Burtis We want Burtis declared the assembly Feet stamped
wildly and fellows at the back of the hall stood up in order to shout
louder Gerald turned and searched with his gaze for Kendall who
sitting in the second row had slunk down behind the broad back of Pete
Girard Burtis Burtis We want Burtis clamored the throng Finally
Jensen and Marion who were seated on either side of Kendall strove
to drag him to his feet The audience applauded them Girard arose
and dragged his chair away revealing Kendall red of face striving
mightily to escape publicity Gerald spoke to him and Kendall got
up and bowed awkwardly and sank into his seat again But the school
was not satisfied Speech Burtis We want a speech Kick us a
speech Burtis Kendall smiling wanly was seen shaking his head at
Gerald who was bending over him and evidently trying to persuade him
to say something The turmoil continued gathering in volume rather
than diminishing Gerald had Kendall by his well arm now and was
pulling him out of the chair Reluctantly Kendall allowed himself to
be conducted to the front of the platform Gerald smiling waved his
hand and stepped back The hall quieted quickly and a most appalling
silence succeeded the tumult Kendall no longer blushing but
whitecheeked from fright began to speak None however save those
in the front rows could hear him although the hall was so still that
one might have heard a pin drop Finally Louder please called a
distant voice Youre misjudging the distance There was a laugh at
that and even Kendall smiled rather tremulously and when he went on
his voice had gained strength

Ive been saying that I never made a speech before he said and so
youll please excuse me now II hope we will win the game and Im
sure we fellows on the team will do the best we know how Thank you
He bowed and turned At that moment a small Prep at the back of the
hall piped up

Hows your arm Burtis

Kendall turned back looked in the direction of the voice and replied
quite naturally Getting along nicely thank you

A howl of delight and laughter arose as Kendall blushing again now
fairly scuttled to his seat and disappeared from sight while a deep
voice down front was heard to proclaim Anyway he doesnt kick with
his arm At which the laughter increased

The demand for more speeches began again but Gerald sprang to the edge
of the platform and asked for a cheer for Yardley It came with a will
Then the players were cheered one after another beginning with Captain
Merriwell and ending with the last substitute and Coach Payson was
cheered and Andy Ryan and finally The team fellows A long cheer
and get into it

Afterward the music began and they went through the halfdozen songs
selected for the game finally ending up with The Years Roll On
every fellow on his feet many of them a little choky as they sang
More cheers then somewhat indiscriminate a scraping of settees and
feet and the meeting was over

Gerald and Kendall met in the corridor and walked back to Clarke
together In front of Oxford some fifty or sixty fellows were still
singing and cheering declaring at intervals that We want a parade We
want a parade When Gerald and Kendall reached the steps of Clarke
Mr Collins was doing his best to persuade the throng that it wanted
nothing of the sort that what it really wanted to do was to go to its
rooms and behave itself From the fact that the singing gradually died
away it may be inferred that Mr Collins was right

Why did you make me get up there and try to talk demanded Kendall
aggrievedly as the two climbed the stairs

Good practice replied Gerald imperturbably Its a handy thing to
know how to make a speech

I guess Ill never have to make many returned Kendall

Gerald smiled knowingly You never can tell he said




CHAPTER XXII

TWO SHEETS OF BUFF PAPER


The warm weather continued on Friday Between recitations The Prospect
and entrances of the halls swarmed with boys all intent on the
discussion of just one subject the morrows game There was a wide
difference of opinion as to the outcome of it Fellows who two weeks
ago had predicted a Yardley victory were now shaking their heads
gloomily and talking defeat while others erstwhile pessimists were
now jubilantly prophesying a glorious triumph for the Blue Perhaps
there was somewhere a fellow who managed to put the game out of his
thoughts and attend to his duty in the form of study but if so he
wasnt in evidence Yardley frankly consigned lessons to the limbo of
things left undone and the faculty wisely shut its eyes

In the afternoon the CrossCountry Team trotted over the course for the
last time before the race and the Football Team held what was expected
to be and what would ordinarily have been its final signal drill
But to the surprise of the fellows who gathered in the gymnasium that
afternoon the coach announced that it had been decided to make a change
in the signal code Payson said he regretted the necessity but made no
explanation of the reason

Ill make it as easy as possible fellows he said There isnt time
to learn thoroughly a new set of signals and so we will change the
code by making the second number the fake instead of the first That
is the second digit of the first number will indicate the man the
second number will be a fake and the second digit of the third number
will indicate the hole Thus    means that fullback carries
the ball for a plunge through guardtackle hole on the left the 
being the fake number In the same way on a kick the signal will be
Kick formation Soandso back    the first number 
holding the kick digit  and the other numbers being fillers Just
remember that the first number indicates the player instead of the
second that the second is the fake and that the third indicates the
hole Now as to special plays The key number has been any number over
 for those given as the second number in the signal Well change
that I think and make the key number any number over  and have
it the first number in the series Thus the signal for the delayed
forward pass to the left will be    the last two numbers
being merely fillers Youll have to study this fellows between now
and tomorrow afternoon for there mustnt be any mixup on signals
Therell be another drill here this evening at eight oclock And
between now and then I want every one of you to plot out on a sheet
of paper one or more plays Indicate each position with circles or
squares label each one with letters as R E for right end and so
on trace the progress of the ball show how the interference moves
and underneath give the correct signals for the play Also be sure
and sign your name in the upper righthand corner of the sheet Dont
neglect this matter if you please I want to know that each one of you
is familiar with the signals Bring the papers here this evening and
hand them to Mr Davis All right now lets see those plays

There was much speculation and not a little dissatisfaction among the
fellows after the drill was over Simms especially was bitter and
sarcastic but Simmss nerves were pretty taut just then and he may be
excused some show of annoyance

Just when we get the signals down pat he goes and changes them said
Simms in the locker room later And what for Id like to know
Putting the fake number in the middle is a fool piece of business I
think

Captain Merriwell to whom Simms addressed his remarks was
noncommital I suppose Payson has a good reason for it he replied
It isnt likely hed do it unless he had Bert You can bet he doesnt
want to risk a mixup on signals tomorrow unless its absolutely
necessary

Well the only reason for changing signals at the last hour that I
can think of muttered Simms is that the other fellow has got on to
them and I dont believe that

I think he will explain this evening or tomorrow said Merriwell
soothingly Meanwhile weve got to make the best of it and learn the
new signals

Thats well enough for you replied Simms bitterly You havent got
to have the whole thing at the end of your tongue tomorrow If I make
a mistake Ill get blamed for it

Then dont make any mistakes answered Merriwell quietly

Simms stared at him a moment outraged and finally said Humph and
relapsed into silence

But Coach Payson didnt explain that evening or ever at least not
to the team at large After the evenings session however he and
Merriwell and Davis went over to the captains room and there the
only member of the trio who was in ignorance of the reason for the
eleventhhour change Manager Davis was enlightened

Now said Payson when they were seated lets see those papers
Davis

One by one he looked them over comparing each with a muchcreased
sheet of buff paper which he extracted from his billbook and laid
beside him Davis looked on curiously Now and then Payson paused as
he turned the papers over and glanced doubtfully at the buff sheet
Finally when he had reached almost the bottom of the pile he said
Hm very softly A second sheet of buff paper was in front of him
and he was studying it attentively Presently as though satisfied he
handed it to Captain Merriwell following it with the creased sheet
The latter had been folded several times and was soiled as though it
had passed through many hands Merriwell frowning compared one sheet
with the other Finally he nodded

I cant believe though that hed do a thing like that sir said
Merriwell troubledly

I can scarcely believe it myself replied the coach but there is
the evidence Show them to Davis Davis should you say that those two
diagrams had been made by the same person

Certainly replied the manager after a brief survey of them There
cant be any doubt of that can there He looked at the name written
in the corner of the fresher sheet But when did Burtis do this other
one sir

Thats what we dont know Have you got that letter there Merriwell

For reply Merriwell opened a drawer in the table searched a moment and
then handed a folded sheet of writing paper across to Perky The latter
opened it and read as follows

    MR CHARLES MERRIWELL
      Yardley Hall School
        Wissining Ct

    Dear Sir

    Theres been a leak over at your place and some dirty work
    over here The enclosed sheet which as I understand it
    is supposed to be an explanation of your signals to be used
    Saturday has just come into my hands Im sending it to you
    thinking that perhaps you will be able to find the sneak who
    sent it We had nothing to do with it here The fellow who
    obtained it did so without authorization on his own hook Im
    sorry about it but I guess the only thing for you to do is
    to change your signals for the game Let me know whether this
    reaches you I dont think it has been seen by more than three
    or four people here including the fellow who received it
    our coach and myself and we havent made any study of it
    Nevertheless youd better protect yourself by changing your
    signals before the game Well look after the fellow at this
    end and I hope youll find the traitor at your end and give
    him what he deserves You fellows cant say we havent always
    played fair and you mustnt blame us for this business I hope
    well have a good day for the game and a dandy contest

                             Yours truly
                                              WILLIAM L RAYNOR

Davis laid down the letter and stared in bewilderment

Merriwell got that this morning said the coach We decided that
the best way to trace the authorship of that document was to get all
the players to make similar diagrams Theres one peculiar thing about
that first paper Davis Youll notice that Burtissupposing he did
it and I cant see any reason to doubt itlabeled the positions with
small letters See what I mean He has written or rather printed
l h b in what printers call lower case instead of L H B in
capitals Now if you look through all the diagrams submitted tonight
and every fellow handed one in youll find that Burtis is the only
one who does that Then too there is the evidence of the paper Both
sheets apparently were torn from the same block The paper is the same
a deep buff in color Theres one other paper there that is buffI
think its Brinspoolsbut it is lighter Now two and two usually
make four Davis

Yes butbut why should he do it Why the fellows were talking of
him for captain

Too bad Its beyond me I cant see any motive The only explanation
I can think of is that some Broadwood fellow got hold of him and fooled
him Im not willing to think that Burtis did this realizing what it
meant Itits absolutely contrary to my conception of the boys
character Davis

It was Gibson declared Perky Ill bet you anything it was that
fellow Gibson You remember the day he came over to spy on us We
fooled him then and so he got back at us But I didnt know Burtis
knew him

Its a funny affair said Merriwell thoughtfully Anyway theres no
use raising a fuss until after the game Were in a bad enough fix as
it is Weve got to work like the very dickens to win tomorrow and if
we let this thing get out the team will be upset probably and well
get licked as sure as shooting You arent going to say anything to him
about it now are you sir

No I think not Better let him alone I dont believe he is morally
guilty fellows And we need him tomorrow if we ever did

Theres one thing that puzzles me observed Davis It doesnt seem
as if the writing was in the same hand as the printing

Yes I noticed that But very often a man writes differently with a
pen than with a pencil Besides you cant very well compare printing
with writing Anyway whoever did it managed to give a very pretty
exposure of our signal code Theyve even got two special plays down
there

Its a rotten piece of business exclaimed Davis And Ill bet
you anything that chap Gibson is at the bottom of it Look here Mr
Payson suppose you let me have a talk with Burtis Maybe I could find
out about it without letting him know

But Payson shook his head and Merriwell dissented with a frown

Better not said the coach Wait until after the game Theres
enough to contend with now Davis dont let us have any more upsets
Well let Burtis play his game tomorrow giving him the benefit of
the doubt and ask an explanation later Its a good thing we are all
agreed that he isnt really guilty fellows for if we werent wed
have no right to let him play and if he didnt playPayson shrugged
his broad shoulderswed be in a hole to say the least Merriwell
you keep this truck until its wanted Put it away somewhere where it
wont be seen Great Scott I wish this hadnt happened

So do I muttered Merriwell

Will the fellows know the new signals all right sir asked Davis
anxiously

I think so The change is slight You see Im taking Raynors word
for it that they havent tried to profit by that document If I
thought they had Id have changed the whole code over made a new set
of signals right through As it is Ive only altered them enough to
safeguard us Well I must be off Get to bed Merriwell and try to
forget the whole thing After all were no worse off than we were or
but very little I must drop in on Simms a minute Hes the one who is
probably having fits Good night Good night Davis Not a word about
this

Not a word sir Good night

Look here Charlie said Perky after the door had closed behind the
coach I just dont believe he did it

Burtis Merriwell shrugged his shoulders wearily Theres the
evidence He nodded at the littered table

Then he was fooled someone got at him Hehe isnt that sort and
you know it Look here they cant make him captain with this thing
hanging over his head Charlie

I dont think he had a show anyway Perky Crandalls the man for the
job I shall propose Crandall

Weell yes Howards all right but

But what

Well there are a lot of the fellows want Burtis replied Perky
frankly Its too bad

Oh never mind about whos the next captain exclaimed Merriwell
crossly What weve got to do now is to win tomorrows game Good
night




CHAPTER XXIII

NO GOAL


At last The day of the game

Many a boy awoke that morning to blink sleepily for a moment and then
full consciousness sweeping upon him to experience a sudden tightening
at the heart and a resultant shortness of breath The moment he had
been looking forward to for fiftyodd days was at hand The greatest
event of the school year was rushing toward him It was enough to
make any fellow feel a bit queer a bit scared too for that matter
By evening he would be either triumphant and proud and happy or
sickeningly disappointed with the feeling that everything had dropped
away from under him So much depended on those short two hours of the
afternoon

The morning had a keen nip to it The warm spell had taken its
departure The sky was blue with an occasional slowly sailing cloud
and the sun was warm in sheltered places But there was a frosty tang
in the air and Winter seemed just over the hills ready at a moments
notice to pounce down upon the Autumn world A light breeze came out of
the northwest and forbade loitering in shaded places It was an ideal
day for the game with a dry field assured and small favor to either
end of it

In the forenoon Yardley got her first taste of victory Geralds
CrossCountry Team simply running away from Broadwood and winning 
to  Yardley finished five men ahead of the first Broadwood runner
and then brought her sixth man in in eighth place and her seventh in
ninth Harry finished in fourth position two minutes behind Gerald
who easily led the field all the way and trotted over the line smiling
and seemingly fresh after his threemile journey

Later there was an early dinner in commons and at a little past
one oclock the boys began to depart for Broadwood Every sort of
conveyance that the town of Greenburg afforded was on hand Gerald
piled his big automobile full of friends Harry and The Duke and Lin
Johnson still in bandages and others we havent met The First
Team journeyed to the scene of the game in a long barge drawn by
three horses and the Second Team had chartered a similar vehicle and
followed close behind in a cloud of dust and a holiday mood The game
was to begin at twofifteen and by half after one Yardley presented
the appearance of a deserted village I doubt if there remained behind
more than three or four of the faculty and Mr McCarthy the janitor

For details regarding the two teams which lined up against each other
that afternoon we can do no better than consult the Greenport News
Here then is what the News published

    Time minute quarters

By two oclock Yardley had taken possession of its section of the small
stand and was overflowing all along the ropes on the west side of the
field Blue flags white lettered were abundant Across the gridiron
Broadwood massed her cohorts and waved her green banners Fathers and
mothers sisters and brothers aunts and cousins faculty and townsfolk
were present in numbers while Old Boys of both schools swaggered
about patronizing resplendent The cheering began when the two teams
trotted on from opposite corners and it continued with only brief
pauses until the final whistle sounded

Broadwood won the toss and chose the north goal Yardley kicking off
to Saunders on his tenyard line The Greens quarter ran back to the
thirtyeight yards before he was smothered The same player immediately
fumbled and Plant fell on the ball after it had rolled to Broadwoods
fortyseven yards Two plays gained little the Green line showing
wonderful defensive powers and Kendall kicked to Broadwoods fiveyard
line Saunders caught and ran back seven yards before he was downed A
Broadwood back fumbled but the Green recovered the ball just inside
the goalline Yardley was cheering like a band of wild Indians A
plunge at the line netted two yards and then Reid kicked from behind
his line the ball going to Crandall in midfield Yardley was set back
fifteen yards for holding on the first play A forward pass went wrong
and Kendall punted to Broadwoods twenty yards the ball going out
Broadwood got started then and after three tries secured her first
down of the game The Yardley line showed weakness at the left of
center The Green worked a fake kick for twelve yards around Cousins
end and followed it with two plunges at Fales which netted another
first down Fales braced then and Broadwoods heavy fullback was
pushed back for a loss Saunders punted and Simms caught on Yardleys
thirtytwo yards and was thrown in his tracks

Yardley opened up with her end plays and Crandall and Kendall reeled
off enough around Furniss to make her distance Simms tried a forward
pass again and Adler got the ball for a small gain A fumble by Simms
and the pigskin rolled ten yards back before Crandall recovered Stark
was caught holding and Yardley was again put back fifteen yards A try
at right end failed and Simms kicked from position Cousins recovering
for Yardley on his fiftyyard line Two tries at tackle netted eight
yards and Kendall failed to make the distance through the left of
center Broadwood hammered the Blue line for short gains and worked
to Yardleys thirtyfive yards A penalty for offside set her back a
skintackle play put her on the Blues twentyeight yards and Saunders
tried a goal from placement The kick went short

Yardley kicked off and Raynor caught and reeled off fifteen yards
before he was thrown Time was called the Broadwood captain having
been hurt in the tackle Broadwood now made a desperate assault on her
enemys defenses and twice made her distance Fales and Plant were
both playing high Broadwood was caught using her hands and set back
Saunders punted and Simms caught on his fiftyyard line and ran back
twelve yards before he was thrown The Broadwood line held firm and
after two tries at it Simms ran around his right end and made his
distance Marion went straight through center for six but failed to
gain on a second attempt in the same place Kendall tried a wide run
around his own left but was thrown for a loss and the pigskin went to
Broadwood Concentrating on Yardleys left wing the Green made eight
yards in two tries Fales was taken out and Jackson went in Gordon
of Broadwood stole four yards around Stark and the quarter ended

So far Broadwood had shown better defensive power than her rival and
Yardley had exhibited a rather more varied attack Simms was running
the team too slowly however and seemed at times uncertain of his
signals although he had made no mistakes

The second quarter opened with the ball in Broadwoods possession near
the center of the field Two plays gained little and Broadwood put in
a substitute for Gordon On the first play the ball went back to the
new fullback and the latter reeled off twentythree yards through a
broken field before he was finally run off at Yardleys twentyseven
yards After the ball was brought in Broadwood twice tried Plant and
gained only four yards Reid again tried a place kick but Yardleys
forwards broke through and the ball bounded from Merriwells head and
rolled to the forty yards where Saunders fell on it for the Green
Broadwood now began to rip through the Yardley line between tackles and
soon had the pigskin back within scoring distance Girard was weakening
fast and on the eighteen yards Best was sent in for him Broadwoods
backs were proving wonderful groundgainers Faking another tryatgoal
from placement the Greens quarter took the ball for a run around his
own left end Kendall brought him down after a threeyard gain With
the ball on Yardleys twelve yards Broadwood concentrated on Merriwell
and made seven yards in two tries a quick doublepass play being
difficult to fathom for Yardley With the pigskin on the fiveyard mark
and three to go on third down with Broadwood thundering for a score
and Yardleys cheerers imploring the Blue to Hold em Hold em a
touchdown seemed inevitable The Greens fullback took the ball and
plunged at the guardtackle hole on the right For an instant the Blue
yielded but the secondary defense piled in to the rescue and when the
whistle blew and the pileup was untangled Broadwood had failed of her
distance by six inches

Kendall fell back between his goalposts and got off a wonderful punt
of fifty yards that Saunders found difficult to handle The ball got
away from him and rolled up the field and by the time he had fallen
on it on his fiftyyard line both Yardley ends were pinning him to the
ground Broadwood took up her journey again but lost fifteen yards
for holding and finally punted from the Blues fortyfive yards
The ball went over the line and Yardley put it in scrimmage on her
twentyfive yards End runs gained twice and a forward pass took the
ball to the Blues fortyeight yards Marion found a weak place at the
Greens left wing and plunged through for seven Kendall following this
with a hairraising run outside of tackle for twelve more Yardleys
supporters howled their delight and went frantic a moment later when
Simms took the ball on a trick play and dashed straight through the
enemys center for ten yards Someone however had been offside and
the ball went back Another end run went wrong and Kendall punted
Saunders caught dodged Cousins and Stark and came back fourteen
yards A fumble by the quarter was recovered for a loss Broadwood
failed to gain through the line and Reid punted Simms ran back ten
yards and was thrown Kendall and Crandall worked a doublepass and
the latter got five yards around the Greens right end Thurston for
once being caught napping The half ended with the ball near the middle
of the field in Yardleys territory

The teams trotted back to the gymnasium and the rival camps sang their
songs Yardley had had the worst of it thus far but her supporters
were far from acknowledging the possibility of defeat Wait until we
get the ball where Burtis can try a goal was the frequent prophecy
Then youll see something

Fales was back at left guard when the third quarter began Broadwood
kicked off Simms caught on his ten yards and on the first lineup
brought the Yardley students to their feet when on a fake kick play
he dashed around Broadwoods right end for twelve yards A forward
pass failed Marion made three through left guard and Kendall booted
Broadwood came back desperately from her thirty yards and in ten
plays planted the pigskin squarely on the fiftyfiveyard line A
plunge at the center gave her her distance Stark was hurt and after
being patched up went back But a minute later he was taken out and
Jensen took his place With two yards to go on a third down Broadwood
was thrown back and it was Yardleys ball on her fortythree yards
Broadwoods left end was negotiated twice and it was first down for
the Blue Furniss was taken out and a redheaded rangy youth took his
place But the gains still continued there and with Crandall and
Kendall and Simms carrying the ball four and five yards were torn off
at a time Marion provided variety by crashing through twice between
right guard and tackle Simms was running the team faster now and no
longer seemed bothered about signals There was one mixup however
which set the Blue back a good six yards But this distance and two
more yards was regained by Kendall who sliced past left tackle
Broadwood was on the run and along the west side of the gridiron the
blue flags waved triumphantly Past the fortyyard line went the ball
past the thirtyfive Yardley still making her distance on each three
tries A mighty plunge by Crandall through left guard set the pigskin
on Broadwoods thirty yards But Crandall was badly injured in the
play and had to give place to Greene Greene celebrated his arrival by
immediately fumbling and the ball went to the enemy on the threshold
of her goal

But Fate played fair for once Two attempts at the Yardley line netted
the Green six yards and Reid fell back to punt There was a poor pass
Jensen got through and Reid was thrown the ball bobbing out of his
hands and across the field to where a halfdozen players of both sides
scrambled for it Plant was the fortunate one and it was once more
Yardleys ball on Broadwoods twentyfive yards Marion tried the
center and got two and Greene shot around the enemys left for three
more bringing the pigskin nearly opposite the goalposts Yardley
waved and howled along the sideline as it saw Kendall walk back up the
field He pulled a handful of dry grass and tossed it into the air to
study the wind Then with feet well apart he raised his arms for the
pass The clamor died to silence and Simmss signals came across the
field sharp and brittle



Back shot the ball the two lines heaved and struggled the big
Broadwood forwards plunged through a tackle brushed Greene from his
path and leaped with upstretched arms at the kicker Too late though
Calmly and slowly Kendalls leg swung forward the ball tapped on the
ground a foot met it squarely and it started upward and forward for
the bar A dozen hands strove in front of it but it cleared them all
A veritable babel of triumph arose to the sky from the Yardley side
faltered failed and died away as a volume of sound crashed from across
the gridiron

No goal No goal shrieked Broadwood




CHAPTER XXIV

AROUND THE END


The blueclad players were walking disconsolately back to the other end
of the gridiron The ball had passed under the bar instead of over
Kendall had missed goal by a foot only but missed it he had Murmurs
of disappointment traveled along the west side of the field For a
minute the blue flags trailed discouragedly But the teams were at it
again and there was still a good four minutes left of the quarter
Yardley advanced and lost the ball on a fumble Broadwood made one
first down and was forced to kick Greene made a startling run after
the catch getting twentyodd yards before he was stopped Marion made
two desperate plunges at left tackle and slid by each time for a short
gain and Kendall made the rest of the distance through right guard
Then came a penalty for offside playing and Kendall punted on the
second down Saunders caught and was downed and the whistle blew for
the third period And there was still no score

Payson sent Crandall back when the last quarter began and made two
other changes Holmes took Simmss place and Brinspool went in for
Marion Fifteen minutes remained in which to conquer or lose and as
the two teams each showing the effects of the struggle faced each
other again on Broadwoods thirtyeight yards it was still anybodys
game

Broadwood secured six yards on two plays and then Reid starting as
if to round Yardleys right end suddenly stopped turned and aimed a
welldirected pass at the redhaired left end The latter was quite
alone and made a good catch and in an instant he was streaking down
the field Only Holmes was between him and a touchdown and Holmes
was well over on the further side of the gridiron Ten yards fifteen
yards and the greenjerseyed youth was still running Past the center
of the field he sped Holmes closing in on him cautiously the rest
of the enemy trailing along desperately in the rear On Yardleys
fortyfive yards the runner swung to the right as though to pass inside
of Holmes but the latter was wary and refused to follow Another ten
yards and the two met The runner dodged to the left as Holmes dived
but the quarters tackle was sure and after three struggling paces
the Broadwood runner came to earth Thirtyfive yards he had reeled
off the ball was on Yardleys twentyseven and Broadwood cheered
frantically It was now or never for the Green and all seemed to
realize it Yardley was for the moment disorganized and her defense
crumbled The Green swept through for eight yards on the first play
gained her distance on the next and stood victoriously on the Yardley
sixteenyard line A conference followed Evidently Saunders was for
trying a field goal while Captain Raynor wanted a touchdown Broadwood
went back to her lineplunging Holmes and Merriwell pleaded and
threatened and the Yardley line braced Two yards was all Broadwood
gained on her first attack a yard and a half on her second There
seemed nothing for it then but a try at goal Reid paced back and took
kicking position Saunders fell to his knees behind center Hold em
now Hold em Get down Smith Stop that man Peebles cried Saunders

Break through fellows implored Holmes hoarsely Block this kick
Block it

Back went the ball but not to Saunders That youth flattened himself
out of the way and Reid was running to his right A cry of warning
broke from Holmes

Watch a pass Watch a pass

But too late Adler had been drawn in and far to the right of the
Yardley end the redhaired youth stood poised for the pass Frantically
a halfdozen Yardley players strove to reach Reid before he could
throw But already he had stopped turned and was taking aim Then away
shot the ball arching gently across the field to the waiting Broadwood
end Adler and Kendall rushed down upon him but the ball descended
into his hands on the fiveyard line and he was away on the instant
Three strides and he was over the last lime mark and heading in toward
goal Simms pulled him down before he had centered the ball but the
damage was done Broadwood had scored On the blackboard at the end of
the field appeared an ominous white figure 

The puntout was caught but Saunders failed to kick the goal and
Yardley took what comfort it might from that Eleven minutes of playing
time still remained and the Blues supporters refused to give up
hope Yardley had only to score a touchdown to tie while a goal from
the touchdown would win the game The blue flags began to wave again
halfheartedly and the cheering started anew The cheer leaders
their blue megaphones gyrating did their utmost but for a time the
responses were weak Broadwood took the defensive immediately after the
kickoff and held to it Yardley played desperately and every trick in
her bundle was tried Twice end runs were started that seemed destined
to change the complexion of the game but each time the runner was
stopped before he could quite get away From one fortyyard line to
the other the play went back and forth Broadwood punting on second
down if not first and Yardley coming back with her end and tackle
plays punting only when forced to And so nearly ten of the remaining
eleven minutes passed away and Broadwoods title to the contest grew
momentarily stronger The linesman had announced two minutes left and
Yardley had just failed to gain on her second down near the Blues
trampled fortyfiveyard line Holmes tried a quarterback kick and it
worked Cousins getting the ball on the Blue thirtyfive yards He was
immediately tackled however and downed Near at hand the blue flags
were tossing ecstatically and hundreds of throats were roaring an
imploring chorus of Touchdown Touchdown Touchdown

It was a time for desperate measures The seconds were ticking off
fast Holmes hurried the line together

Come on Come on Signals  

Back went the ball thudding against Brinspools stomach as he dashed
forward Merriwell and Jensen opened the hole and Brinspool staggered
through twisting panting the ball clutched tightly The sound of
rasping canvas of bodies straining together of grunts and cries
of panting breaths A wild confusion of lunging struggling forms
of grasping arms of wide anxious eyes of white tired faces
dirtstreaked and convulsed with effort A faint grumbling cry of
Down and the shrilling of the whistle And Yardley had wrested
four yards from the enemy

Line up quick howled Holmes Get into this Weve got em going
fellows They cant hold us Signals Right tackle over 


It was Brinspool again he was playing today as he had never played
before all season it was Brinspool between his tackle and end at the
right Brinspool taking the ball at a short throw and crashing past the
Broadwood tackle for another three yards Then the whistle again and
Merriwell staggering out toward the sideline asking the time and
Holmes begging him to come back and never mind

Weve time to put it over he cried Line up fellows

Forty seconds called the linesman

Holmes faltered and passed a hand over his face Broadwood jubilant
broke into exultant cries Hold them Broadwood Its their last
play Stop this Throw them back Get under em

Signals growled Holmes Kick formation Burtis back He turned and
viewed the positions Greene and Brinspool were crouched already at the
right and Kendall whitefaced but steady was raising his hands Get
this Burtis and make it good boy Signals 

Signals Signals shrieked Greene as Kendalls heart leaped Holmes
darted a look of murder at the offending Greene

Signals he cried again chopping out the numbers with hoarse barks
 

Block this kick Block it shrieked Broadwood

Back swept the ball from between Bests wideset feet back to Kendall
at headheight Up went his hands out swung a leg and then with the
ball tucked in the crook of his left elbow he was plunging across the
field to his left while shrieks and cries filled the air It was the
play that had won the Nordham game a simple run from kick formation
a play easy to stop if expected but likely to gain if not And in
this case Broadwood had looked for a kick reasoning that Yardley
had given up all idea of trying to win by rushing that in the few
seconds remaining she would try to mitigate her defeat by securing the
three points that a goal from field would yield her And Broadwood
was napping on the right of her line The brilliant Thurston who had
made himself feared all through the game who had spoiled more than
one attempt at his end of the line had crept in and up desperately
determined to get inside of the Yardley end and spoil the kick It was
Broadwoods right halfback Reid who first scented the danger and
started to intercept Kendall Saunders pounded behind him But the
Yardley interference was well formed well spaced and desperate Reid
went down with Holmes and Greene blocked Saunders At that instant
Kendall turned in and leaped toward the goalline his right elbow
locked and his arm stretched out to meet the foe Six white lines lay
between him and the goal He crossed two in safety Greene speeding
beside him Then the enemy swept upon him Greene threw himself in the
path of a frantic foe and went down and Kendall ran alone

Three white streaks danced before his eyes now A form leaped at him
all blueclad arms and Kendalls open hand flattened against a face
and he was still free Two lines more now only two A shock almost
threw him from his feet hands were clutching at his hips he whirled
on one heel staggered and broke away a form dashed in front of him
hands stretching upward Kendall leaped and went over the falling foe
the last line was under foot One strideanother Many hands fell
upon him dragging him down He tried to shake free but they were too
many for him He fell to his knees something crashed against him
driving the remaining breath from his body and he toppled over on the
turf the old injury paining horribly and his lungs bursting for air

Illustration Something crashed against him driving the remaining
breath from his body

They led him away to the sidelines for the leather harness had failed
him and the bones had slipped out again And while the spectators
held their breaths Fales tried to kick a goal Victory for the Blue
depended on his efforts and he knew it Weary and panting he directed
the poising of the ball stepped forward and kicked The pigskin rose
erratically turned lazily over and dropped weakly to earth in front
of the charging Broadwood line And Fales sat down on the turf rolled
onto his face buried his head in his arms and wept

Said the scoreboard Broadwood  Visitors 




CHAPTER XXV

KENDALL IS MISTAKEN


Kendall sat in a corner of the barge as it rattled its way through
clouds of dust back to Wissining They had pulled his wrist into
place again bandaged it and put it back in a sling Every bump of
the barges weak springs made it throb painfully But it was not his
injury that Kendall minded It was the knowledge that he had failed his
fellows and the school That was what hurt He had lost the game he
told himself miserably It had needed only that goal from the field to
win and he had missed it He still wondered how it had happened He
had dropped the ball as well as he knew how had kicked at the right
instant his instep had met it squarely he was convinced that he
had made no miscalculation of the distance And yet by some unhappy
chance the ball had barely cleared the bar underneath instead of
sailing over Since the whistle had blown he had avoided the glances of
his teammates was avoiding them now He knew that by tomorrow they
would find excuses for him the kinderhearted ones at least but now
they must all loathe him and he didnt want to read that loathing in
their faces So he kept his eyes on the roadside all the way back to
school only occasionally conscious of his aching wrist and was very
unhappy and weary and sore

Here and there some of the fellows were conversing jerkily in tired
voices but there was no joking today no bantering no laughing no
singing as the team went home It seemed to them all that the tie had
been a defeat For the moment they had lost sight of the fact that
Broadwood had outweighed them and that in playing their rival to a
tied score they had perhaps gained some glory after all Yardley had
grown accustomed to victory on the gridiron and anything less than a
victory spelled disgrace to them They were thankful each and every
one of them that until the barge reached Yardley they would not have
to face their fellows Now and then a lighter vehicle passed and the
occupants leaned out and shouted and waved their flags as they went by
But the players made no response Perhaps one or two grinned stoically
perhaps here and there a fellows face worked and his throat choked up
Tomorroweven later this same eveningthey would begin to see things
less pessimistically but now thoroughly tired aching and sore it
seemed to them that they were little better than pariahs The bottom
had just dropped out of everything and they were left dangling in space

When the barge rolled up the drive to the front of Oxford a crowd had
already gathered about the steps a throng of nearly a hundred and the
returning warriors were met with cheers that were hearty and loyal
A look of dull surprise overspread some of the faces in the barge
some of the fellows smiled a little others grew frankly tearful All
shouldered their way through the crowd and sought their rooms avoiding
the hands that would have detained them and the questions that met
them Afterward as other vehicles returned and emptied their loads
the gathering grew and the cheers became louder and louder and when
finally some two hundred voices took up the strains of the school song
and sang it through proudly and lovingly and even exultantly youd
never have guessed that Yardley held herself defeated

Number  was dark when Kendall reached it Gerald was not there
and he was very glad He didnt light the lights but crossed to the
windowseat after he had taken off his coat and cap and threw himself
down among the cushions to think it all over again Thinking however
made it no better It seemed to him that he was disgraced that even
his usefulness to the school was over He hated to think of the morrow
when he would have to face the fellows and read the verdict in their
faces He could imagine the whispers as he went by Thats the failure
that lost the Broadwood game for us Of course there would be some
who wouldnt let it make any difference Theyd be disappointed in him
but theyd try not to let him see and theyd be loyal stillGerald
for instance and Harry and yes probably The Duke And perhaps one or
two others And maybe after a while he would get over it Perhaps by
the time the Winter term began it would be half forgotten and he could
hold up his head again

Once it occurred to him that had Fales kicked the goal after the
touchdown they would still have won a victory But he was charitable
toward Fales Fales had been worn out almost ready to collapse and it
was no wonder he had missed Besides Fales was not supposed to excel
at goalkicking With Kendall it was different He was first of all a
kicker he had been given his place on the team because they believed
he could be depended on to score from the field And he had failed
at the one most important moment of the season Kendall groaned and
turned his head as though to get away from his thoughts

The world outside the windows got blacker and blacker He knew that in
the next building they were gathering for the banquet and the election
But he had no intention of going He didnt want to face them yet
while as for eating he didnt care if he never saw food again Now
and then a voice or a strain of whistling or a bar of song came up to
him as fellows passed under the window Once there was a long burst of
cheering from commons One of the Old Boys perhaps a former football
hero had entered the dininghall probably Well theyd never cheer
him that way never unlessyes there was another year coming after
all Perhaps theyd give him a chance to retrieve to make up then
For a moment he felt better But then the thought that if he failed
to win his scholarship this year he wouldnt be likely to get back
again sent his spirits down once more And so for another hour he lay
there in selfabasement and selfaccusation and got a little tearful
at times and felt pretty miserable And finally tired out physically
and mentally he fell asleep and only awoke when someone thumped on the
door and called his name loudly He sat up with a wince as his injured
arm was jolted and rubbed his eyes

Burtis You in there demanded the caller imperatively The knob
rattled but Kendall had turned the key and the door denied admittance
For a brief instant Kendall clung to his desire for seclusion But
then as there came a kick which threatened to drive a panel in he
answered

Hello Who is it please

Simms Open the door you silly chump What time do you think it is

Kendall crossed the room in the darkness and turned back the key The
door was pushed open admitting a flood of light from the corridor
Simms stared in at him

What the dickens are you doing he demanded Been asleep

Yes a little while answered Kendall

Well find your cap and come on Were half through dinner Weve been
looking for you for an hour

II dont think I want to go over there thanks murmured the other
Imy arms pretty sore and Im tired

What of it Dont you think the rest of us are tired too And sore
Gosh I havent a bone in my body that isnt yelping Besides weve
got to elect a new captain pretty soon

You wont need my vote Kendall demurred Id vote for Crandall if
I was there You could tell them that couldnt you

Crandall Well say Simms paused and chuckled Just the same
youd better come Burtis They sent me for you and I cant go back
without you Get your cap like a good fellow

They sent for me Who Simms

Why the lot of them the whole push of course replied the quarter
impatiently

Do you meanthat theyreally want me faltered Kendall

Really want you Say whats the matter with you old man Simms
looked curiously into the other boys face Then he whistled softly
So thats it eh he asked as though of himself He put one hand
on Kendalls shoulder Look here Burtis he said affectionately
youve got some fool notion in your head havent you Feeling sore I
guess about that goal you didnt make Is that it

Whywhy of course I feel pretty rotten about it answered the
younger boy And I thoughtperhaps the other fellows His voice
dwindled away into silence

Simms laughed cheerfully Then his fingers closed reassuringly on
Kendalls shoulder Poppycock Burtis Poppycock my son No ones
holding that against you How could they Great Scott havent we all
made mistakes today You dont think you lost the game do you
Well you didnt No more than I did or Merriwell or Fales or any
of the rest of usalone We all had a hand in it Burtis Besides
Paysons been giving us a whole earful of guff about what a little
band of heroes we are Why Payson says we never had any show for that
game by rights Says we only tied em because we didnt know we were
licked Simmss voice dropped Burtis dont be a silly chump Get
your cap and come along Theres a seat by me you can have Come and
see for yourself whether we want you there

It seemed too good to be true and as he turned away to dash a sponge
across his face his eyes got leaky again and it took him a long time
to get through with the towel and find his cap Then he was following
Simms down the stairs and along the walk and through the entrance to
Whitson alive with students awaiting the result of the election As
the two pushed their way through the fellows fell back for them
cheering and shouting laughing and joking Kendall followed the
quarter as in a daze The big door opened and he saw the long table
spread in the middle of the hall and lined on each side with the
fellows There was Merriwell at the head and John Payson at the foot
turning at the sound of the opening door and Perky Davis and yes
Andy Ryan too and all the other fellows between talking and laughing
as though Yardley had really won

Kendall faltered at the door but Simms dragged him on Got him
fellows he announced pushing Kendall forward into the flood of light
about the table Found him sound asleep and almost had to kick the
door in

Hello Burtis you old top shouted Girard

Everythings eaten up Burtis cried Marion

Kendall found himself pushed into a chair between Simms and Adler
Everyone was talking at him laughing at him it seemed and wonder
of wonders every face was kindly If an expression of doubt crept now
and then into Merriwells countenance as he glanced at the newcomer
Kendall didnt see it Nor did he discern that Coach Payson was viewing
him in a halfpuzzled way For a space in fact he saw very little
Eager hands passed him things and piled his plate high and Kendall
pecked at the viands too happy to really eat

But after a while he began to hear what was going on about him They
were still talking over the game but the former despondency was
all gone Rather they were slightly boastful now Plant in high
spirits was explaining loudly what would have happened if one tiny
infinitesimal thingKendall couldnt make out just what it washad
been different Why in that case wed have knocked the green
sawdust out of em declared Plant And he appealed to Mr Payson
for confirmation The coach smiled and nodded Holmes was already
predicting the horrible fate that awaited Broadwood next year Next
year seemed the keynote now Simms and Adler talked in front of
Kendall and had a hot discussion over some unimportant happening of
the day and threatened each other with fruit knives There was much
noise and confusion all very jolly and happy Kendall drank a cup
of coffee and nibbled a banana that someone thrust at him settled
contentedly back in his chair stretched his tired legs under the table
and began to see the world through a wonderful mellow golden haze

Then it must have been a halfhour later when the last spoon had
been laid reluctantly aside although many diners were still sipping
their second or third cups of black coffee Captain Merriwell arose and
hammered the table for attention One by one the voices died away and
the captain made his speech He thanked them all for the bully way in
which they had stood by him and the school for the great game they had
put up today and he thanked Coach Payson for his patience and hard
work and

But the rest was lost in the sound of cheers and the tinkling of silver
against goblets and the thumping of feet

And now it remained to choose a captain for next year Merriwell
went on It was customary for the retiring captain to make the first
nomination but he wasnt going to do that tonight He was going to
let them make their selection without any suggestion from him knowing
that whoever they chose would be the right man And nominations were in
order

More cheering then and some laughter and finally a quieter mood
while the fellows glanced curiously around the table and waited
Cousins pushed back his chair and stood up smiling as the fellows
began to clap

I cant make a speech fellows and I dont need to Weve got plenty
of fellows on this team who would make good captains and for my part I
say its hard to choose Applause and cries of Thats right But in
my opinion I think theres one in especial that deserves the position
Hes played three full years on the team hes a fellow we all likeI
might say loveandwell I think hes the captain we want Fellows
I place in nomination Howard Crandall

Lots of cheering then and lots of kindly looks toward the blushing
Crandall Simms and Fales who sat on his other side had their heads
together Then Simms started up but Stark was ahead of him Stark was
saying nice things about Pete Girard and Pete was struggling to throw
a napkin at him and repeating Sit down you big chump I dont want
to be captain much to the amusement of the table But Pete got his
meed of applause when Stark finished and then Simms sprang up

Fellows weve had good names put before us Crandall bless his old
hide would make a good captain So would Girard if he could keep
awake Sit down Pete Either one of them would do to lead usI mean
the rest of you fellows because some of us will be out of it next
yearto lead you to victory But fellows theres one here who hasnt
been named yet and I know youre waiting for it Weve got a fellow
here who would make the sort of captain we want the sort we love to
follow the sort that Chase was in the old days before we came here
and that Vinton was and that Merriwell has been He hasnt served his
three years fellows but that cant be helped It isnt his fault
its our misfortune Hes only been two seasons on the team but in
that time hes yanked one game out of the fire for us and saved us from
defeat in the other And fellows Simms paused and seemed debating
with himself Then Fellows when the rest of us were feeding our
faces here tonight and jollying up this chap was staying away because
he thought hed failed us today and that we didnt want him here
Fellows I nominate for the captaincy of the Yardley Hall Football Team
for the Season of  Mr Kendall Burtis




CHAPTER XXVI

GERALD IS SURPRISED


Simms must have been right when he said they were waiting for that
name for such a burst of applause went up as to set the fixtures
shaking above the table Napkins waved and goblets rang Kendall
staring bewilderedly told himself that it was a dream that he had not
heard aright And yet they were all looking at him and waving at him
and crying his name He gazed about the color rushing into his cheeks
and showed such a terrified countenance that the cheers grew into
laughter Merriwell was rapping for silence again Are there any more
nominations he asked trying to make himself heard It seemed that
there were not Then please come to order fellows You have three
candidates to vote on

Leave me out Charlie called Pete Girard I decline the honor

Then two began Merriwell again But Crandall was on his feet

I want to thank the fellows who nominated me he announced but
I withdraw too please And Id like to make Burtiss nomination
unanimous

In the confusion of cheering that followed Merriwell had hard work
making himself heard Finally though Those in favor of the election
of Kendall Burtis will stand up he announced Every chair was pushed
back save those of Merriwell who was already standing of Coach
Payson and Andy Ryan who had no voice in the proceedings and of
Kendall himself Marion mounted a chair and called for Three cheers
for Burtis fellows Let her go The cheers came with a will and were
followed by cries of Speech Speech Kendall his eyes on the table
and his well hand nervously employed in the manufacture of bread pills
felt himself being lifted to his feet It was an awful thing to have to
say anything for his voice was nowhere to be found at first and when
it did come it was so shaky and low that for a moment no one could hear
it

Finally however his halting words reached them

Awfully afraid youve made aa most horrible mistake he was
saying and I wish youd change your minds fellows Honestly and
he looked appealingly aboutI dont think I could do it fellows

A howl of delight and derision went up Kendall faltered again

IId like you to excuse me please and

Not on your life Youre elected Burtis

Kendall turned questioningly pleadingly to Simms Simms laughing
shook his head No use he said Youre it

Kendall gulped smiled wanly started to sit down reconsidered and
went on Then all I can say is that Im awfully much obliged and that
IIll do the best I know how But I hope youll all help me a lot
becausebecause I dont know much about my job

Merriwell looking worried went down the table and for a minute
conversed in whispers with Coach Payson The coach frowned and
nodding finally arose and walked to the side of the room Merriwell
tapped Kendall on the shoulder

I say Burtis just come over here a minute will you

Kendall wondering accompanied the other to where the coach stood The
rest of the team followed them with curious eyes

Burtis said Payson pulling a folded sheet of paper from his pocket
have you ever seen this before

Kendall looked at it in surprise Then Why yes sir I think so I
drew that diagram but I didnt do all that writing

How did you happen to make the diagram asked Merriwell

Why a fellow came to my room one night and we got to talking about
signals the different systems you know he had some scheme of his own
and wanted to know what I thought of it I didnt think much of it
though

Who was this fellow asked Payson

Kendall hesitated Is thereis there any trouble about this he
asked

It was Paysons turn to hesitate and he looked uncertainly at
Merriwell Finally Yes this has made some trouble or very nearly

Then I guess Id better not say who the fellow was replied Kendall

Im afraid youll have to Burtis This sheet of paper contains a
full explanation of our signals for the Broadwood game the original
signals you understand It was sent to someone at Broadwood and got to
the hands of the captain He returned it to Merriwell Now you see some
explanation is necessary Burtis

But I only made the diagram It was before we learned the new signals
Mr Payson

This other chap whose name you wont tell took this paper away with
him when he left

Yes sir I never thought

And you did not tell him afterwards about the signals for the
Broadwood game

No sir We never spoke of the thing again

And you say this is not your writing

No sir it isnt

And you know nothing more of this than youve told us Burtis

I really dont Im awfully sorry I made that diagram buthe
said

This other fellow

Yes sir He said he wanted to work out a better system and asked me
to explain the one we were using then That was all there was to it
Mr Payson

Payson frowned Im very much inclined to believe you Burtis he
said kindly but you must see that until this matter is cleared up you
cantervery well accept the captaincy If I were you Id see that
other fellow right away and get him to tell what he knows Burtis

Yes sir Andand am I toto tell them that I cant be captain sir

No that isnt necessary I thinkHello Davis Want to see me

Why yes I guess so Mr Payson Are you talking about that business
of the signals Because if you are I can clear that up in a jiffy

Well for goodness sake do it ejaculated Payson What do you know

I know the whole story replied Perky importantly Heres how it
was Cotton got Burtis to make that diagram for him Then he sneaked
into the gym that night we were having signal drillI told you I saw
someone but you wouldnt believe meand got the signals Maybe he
was there another time but he doesnt own to it

Then he acknowledges this asked Merriwell

Sure He had to I made him

How did you get hold of it Perky

Did a little detective work Got a clue from George Kirk just by
accident Kirk saw Cotton and that fellow Gibson together in Greenburg
the day he came back from the golf match with Broadwood I put two
and two together found that Cotton was at Broadwood two years ago
and then went and told him I knew all about it He thought I did and
fessed up

Where is he now asked Merriwell angrily

Perky shrugged his shoulders Search me he said He left here this
morning Thats all I know

A halfhour later Kendall opened the door of Number  Outside
there were still faint echoes of the cheering that had greeted the
announcement of the election Gerald who had dined at home that
evening was in the room and with him was Harry Merrow Had Kendall
been especially discerning just then he might have told from the
expressions on their faces that they had heard the news But he wasnt
he was too excited for one thing And being excited he tried not to
show it He said Hello restrainedly laid his cap down and took a
chair

Hello responded Gerald carelessly Been to the banquet

Kendall nodded

Did they elect a captain asked Harry gravely

Kendall nodded again There was a silence Finally and rather
sheepishly Kendall said

What do you suppose those fellows did Gerald

What fellows asked Gerald suppressing a grin

Kendall nodded vaguely in the direction of commons Those fellows
thethe football team

Oh I dont know Raised roughhouse I suppose What did they do
Kendall

TheytheyKendall found himself blushingthey made me captain

What Gerald turned and viewed the grinning Harry in wild
amazement Why I was never so surprised in all my life
