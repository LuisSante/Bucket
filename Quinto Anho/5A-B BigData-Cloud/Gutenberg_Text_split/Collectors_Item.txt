Sidenote Being trapped in the steaming hl of Venus is no excuse for
forgetting ones mannersbut anyone abducted marooned tricked kept
from tea might well crack under the strain

What I should like to know Professor Bernardi said gazing pensively
after the lizardman as he bore the shrieking form of Miss Anspacher off
in his scaly arms is whether he is planning to eat her or make love to
her Because in the latter instance Im not sure we should interfere
It may be her only chance

Illustration

Carl his wife cried indignantly Thats a horrid thing to say You
must rescue her at once

Oh I suppose so he said then gave his wife a nasty little grin that
he knew would irritate her It isnt that shes unattractive my dear
in case you hadnt noticed though shes pretty well past the bloom of
youth

Will you stop making leering noises and go save her or not

I was coming to that Its just that she persists in using her PhD as
a club to beat men into respectful pulps Men dont like being beaten
into respectful pulps whether by a man or a woman Now if shed only
learned that other people have feelings

If you dont stop lecturing and go I will his wife threatened

All right all right he said wearily Come on Mortland

                                   

The two scientists slogged through the steamy odorous jungle of Venus
and soon reached the lizardman who weighed down by his captive had
not been able to travel as fast

You blast him the professor told Mortland Try not to hit Miss
Anspacher if you can manage it

ErIve never fired one of these things before Mortland said Cant
stand having my eardrums blasted However here goes He pointed his
weapon at the lizardlike creature in a gingerly manner Ahhands up
he ordered Only fair to give thewell blighter a sporting chance
he explained to Professor Bernardi

To their amazement the lizardman promptly dropped Miss Anspacher into
the lavendercolored mud and put up his hands Miss Anspacher gave an
indignant yelp

Seems intelligent in spite of the kidnaping Mortland commented But
how does he happen to understand English Were the only expedition ever
to have reached Venus  that I know of anyway He and the professor
stared at each other in consternation There may have been a secret
expedition previously and perhaps they left aa base or something
which would explain why

If you two oafs would stop speculating you might help me out of
here Miss Anspacher remarked in her customary snappish tone Professor
Bernardi leaped forward to obey You dont have to pull quite so hard
I havent taken root yet She came out of the mud with a sound like two
whales kissing She brushed hopelessly at her oncewhite blouse and
shorts Oh dear I look a mess

Professor Bernardi did not comment being engaged in slapping at a small
winged creatureabout the size of a bluejay but looking like a cross
between a bat and a mosquitothat seemed interested in taking a bite
out of him It escaped his flapping hand and flew to the top of
Mortlands sun helmet where it glared at the professor

Since you seem to understand English Miss Anspacher said to the
lizardman through a mouthful of hairpins perhaps you will be so kind
as to explain the meaning of this outrage

I was smitten the alien replied suavely Passion made me forget
myself

Professor Bernardi looked thoughtfully at him A prior expedition isnt
the answer It wouldnt have troubled to educate you so thoroughly
Therefore the explanation is that you pick up English by reading our
minds Correct

The lizardman turned an embarrassed olive Yes

                                   

Now that he was able to give the creature a more thorough inspection
Bernardi saw that he really didnt look too much like a lizard He
definitely appeared to be wearing clothes of some kind which in the
Venusian heat indicated a particularly refined degree of
civilizationunless of course the squamous skin protected him from
the heat as well as the humidity

More than that though he was humanoid in almost a Hollywood way He
had a particularly fine profile and an athletic physique which oddly
his scales seemed to enhance much like a movie idol dressed in
finemeshed Medieval armor Naturally he had a tail but it was as well
proportioned as a kangaroos though shorter and more graceful and it
struck Professor Bernardi as a particularly handsome and useful gadget

For one thing the people from Earth were standing uncomfortably in the
slippery mud while the lizardman was using his tail much in the
fashion of a spectator stool leaning back against it almost in a
sitting position with his armorshod feet supporting him comfortably
For another the tail undoubtedly served for balance and the added push
of a walking stick and perhaps for swift attack or getaway Very
practical and attractive the professor concludedtoo bad Man had
relinquished his tail when climbing down from the trees

Thank you the saurian said with uneasy modesty looking at him Good
of you to think so You are a fairly intelligent species arent you

Fairly the professor acknowledged preoccupied with a clever idea
Perhaps existence on Venus wasnt going to be as unpleasant as he had
anticipated From reading my mind you know what this blaster can do
dont you

Im afraid so

Then you know what I expect of you

Yes sahib Ise comin massa To hear is to obey effendi The
creature turned and went briskly back toward the camp leaving the
others to stumble after him

Mrs Bernardi gave a shriek as his handsome scaled form emerged from the
greenishwhite underbrush haloed in luminous yellow mist Algol the
ships cat prudently took sanctuary behind her then peered out to see
what was going on and whether there was likely to be anything in it for
him

This is our native bearer Professor Bernardi explained as the three
scientists burst out of the jungle

My name is JrannPttt The creature bowed low At your service
madame

Oh Carl Mrs Bernardi clapped her hands Hes just perfect So
thoughtful of you to find one that speaks English I do hope you can
cook Pitt

I will do my best madame

                                   

Algol daintily picked his way through the mud toward the saurian
sniffed him with judicial deliberation then deciding that anyone who
smelled so much like the better class of fish must be All Right rubbed
against his legs

Well remarked Miss Anspacher using the side of the spaceship as a
mirror by which to redden her somewhat prissy lips that makes it
practically unanimous doesnt it

All except Professor Bernardi said JrannPttt looking at the
scientist with what might have been a smile He doesnt like me

I see that your telepathic powers are not quite accurate the
professor returned I do not dislike you I distrust you

The fact that the two terms are not entirely synonymous in your
language would argue a certain degree of incipient civilization the
lizardman observed

You know Carl Mrs Bernardi whispered he has an awfully funny way
of talking for a native

Frankly I dont like this at all Professor Captain Greenfield said
mopping his brow with a limp handkerchief If I hadnt been off looking
for a better berth for the shipall this mud worries methisd never
have happened

You mean you would have let the lizard get away with Miss Anspacher

The big mans face flushed crimson I dont think thats funny
Professor

Bernardi quickly changed the subject for he realized that the captain
being by far the most muscular of the party was not a man to trifle
with Tell me Greenfield did you succeed in finding a better spot for
the ship I must admit Im worried about that mud myself

Only remotely dry spot around is an outcropping bout two kilometers
away Greenfield said grudgingly He shifted his camp stool in a futile
search for shade Even though the sun never penetrated the thick layer
of clouds the yellow light diffused through them was blinding Might
be big enough but its not level Could blast it smooth but thatd
take at least a weekEarth time

Bernardi pulled his damp shirt away from his body Well I daresay
well be all right where we are if were not assailed by any violent
forces of nature On Earth this might be a monsoon climate

If you ask me that monster is more of a danger than any monsoon

Bernardi sighed Although by far the most competent officer available
for the job of spaceship captain Greenfield was not quite the man he
would have chosen to be his associate for months on end Still
beggarsas Miss Anspacher might have eloquently put itcould not be
choosers What makes you say that he asked trying to set an example
of tolerance

Dont like the idea of him cooking for us the captain said
stubbornly Might poison us all in our beds

Well dont eat in your bed suggested Mortland strolling out of the
airlock in the company of the cat Algol however finding that the spot
beside the captains camp stool was as dry as anything could be on
Venus decided to turn back

                                   

The difficulty is easily overcome Captain the professor said still
holding on to his patience You can continue to cook your own meals
from the tinned and packaged foods on board ship The rest of us will
eat fresh native foods prepared by JrannPttt

But why Miss Anspacher interrupted as she emerged from the airlock
with a large castiron skillet should you think JrannPttt wants to
poison us

Both men rose from their stools Stands to reason hed consider us his
enemies Miss Anspacher the captain said After all weas a group
that iscaptured him

Hired him Professor Bernardi contradicted Ive telepathically
arranged to pay him an adequate salary In goods of course I dont
suppose our money would be of much use to him And I think hes rather
glad of the chance to hang around and observe us conveniently

Observe us Greenfield exclaimed You mean hes spying out the land
for an attack Lets prepare our defenses at once

I doubt if thats what he has in mind Professor Bernardi said
judiciously

He may be staying because he wants to be near me Miss Anspacher
blurted Overcome by this unmaidenly admission she reddened and rushed
from them calling Yoohoo JrannPttt Here is the frying pan Algol
woke up instantly and followed her Frying was one of the more
important words in his vocabulary

Captain Greenfield stared across the clearing after them then turned
back to Bernardi with a frown I dont like to see one of our girls
mixed up with a lizardand a foreign lizard at that But his face too
clearly betrayed a personal resentment

Dont tell me you have aa fondness for Miss Anspacher Captain
Professor Bernardi exclaimed genuinely surprised Undeniably Miss
Anspacheralthough no longer in her first youthwas a handsome woman
but he would not have expected her somewhat cerebral type to appeal to
the captain On the other hand she was the only unattached woman in the
party and they were a long way from home

Greenfield picked a fleck of dried violet mud from the side of the ship
and avoided Bernardis eye One of the reasons I came along he said
almost bashfully Thought Id have the chance to be alone with her now
and again and impress her with with

Your sterling qualities Bernardi suggested

The captain flashed him a glance of mingled gratitude and resentment
And now this damned lizard has to come along

Cheer up Captain said the professor Ill back you against a lizard
any time

                                   

Although the long twilight of Venus had deepened into night and it could
never really be cool there by terrestrial standards the temperature was
almost comfortable Everything was quite black except for the pallid
purple campfire glowing through the darkness the clouds that
perpetually covered the surface of the planet prevented even the light
of the stars from reaching it

Tell me more about the crossversus the parallelcousin relationships
in your culture JrannPttt Miss Anspacher breathed wriggling her
camp stool closer to the saurians Anthropology is a great hobby of
mine you know How do your people feel about exogamy

Im afraid Im rather exhausted dear lady he said using one arm to
mask a yawn and one to surreptitiously wave away the saurian head that
was peering out of the underbrush I shouldnt like to give a scientist
like yourself any misinformation that might become a matter of record

Of course not she murmured Youre so considerate

                                   

A pale face appeared in the firelight like some weird creature of
darkness Terrestrial and extraterrestrial both started Miss
Anspacher the captain growled Id like to lock up the ship so if
you wouldnt mind turning in

Miss Anspacher pouted Youve interrupted such an interesting
conversation And I dont see why you have to lock up the ship After
all the night is three hundred and eightyfive hours long We dont
sleep all that time and it would be a shame to be cooped up

Im going to try to rig up some floodlights Greenfield explained
stiffly so we wont be caught like this again Nobody bothered to tell
me the day equals thirtytwo of ours so that half of it would be
night

Then I wont see you for almost two weeks of our time JrannPttt Are
you sure you wouldnt like to spend the rest of the night in our ship
Plenty of room you know

No thank you dear lady The jungle is my natural habitat I should
feel stultified by walls and a ceiling Dont worryI shant run away

Oh Im not worried Miss Anspacher said coyly throwing a stick of
wood on the fire

Small riddance if he does

Captain Greenfield

That part of the captains face not concealed by his piratical black
beard turned red Well if he can read our minds he knows damn well
what Im thinking anyway so why be hypocritical about it

Thats righthe is a telepath isnt he Miss Anspachers face grew
even redder than the captains I forgot he It is getting late I
really must go Good night JrannPttt

Good night dear lady The saurian bowed low over her hand

Leaning on the captains brawny arm Miss Anspacher ploughed through the
mud to the ship followed by the mosquitobat and Algol who had been
toasting themselves more or less companionably at the fire The door to
the airlock clanged behind all four of them

                                   

The other saurians head appeared again from the bush JrannPttt the
insistent thought came shall I rescue you now

Why DfarLll I am not a prisoner Im quite free to come and go
as I please But lets get away from the strangers ship while we
communicate They do have a certain amount of lowgrade perception and
might be able to sense the presence of another personality At any rate
they might look out of a port and see you

Keeping the illuminator on low beam DfarLll led the way through the
bushes Seems to me youre going to an awful lot of trouble just to get
zoo specimens the youngster protested disentangling its arms from the
embrace of an amorous vine Theres really no reason for carrying on
the work since Lieutenant MerglytRuuu  passed on

JrannPttt sat down on a fallen log and tucking up his graceful tail
signaled his junior to join him In the event that we do decide to
return to base some handsome specimens might serve to offset the
lieutenants demise

Return to base But I thought we were

We havent found swamp life pleasant have we After all theres no
real reason why we shouldnt go back Is it our fault that MerglytRuuu
happened to meet with a fatal accident

Weell  but will the commandant see it that way

On the other hand if we dont go back wouldnt it be a good idea to
attach ourselves to an expedition that no matter how alien is better
equipped for survival than we And carrying out our original purpose
seemed the best way of getting to meet these strangers informally as it
were

They are unquestionably intelligent lifeforms then

After a fashion JrannPttt yawned and rose But why are we sitting
here Lets start back to our camp We will be able to converse more
comfortably

They made their way through the junglenow walking now wading where
the mud became water Small creatures with hardly any thoughts scurried
before them as they went

The commandant may have already made contact with their rulers
DfarLll suggested springing forward to illuminate the way In that
case we couldnt hope to remain undiscovered for long

Oh these creatures are not Venusians Theres no intelligent life
here They hail from the third planet of this system and according to
their thoughts this is the only vessel that was capable of traversing
interplanetary space So we neednt worry about extradition treaties or
any other official annoyances

If theyre friendly why didnt you spend the night in their ship It
certainly looks more comfortable than our collapsible moslakwhich by
the way collapsed while you were gone I hope well be able to put it
up again ourselves I must say this for the lieutenanthe was good at
that sort of thing

JrannPttt made a gesture of distaste He was unfortunately good at
other things too But lets not discuss him Im not staying with the
strangers because I want to pick up one or two little thingsmostly
some of our food to serve them I used up all the supplies in my pack
and I want them to think were living off the land They believe me to
be a primitive and its best that they should until I decide just how
Im going to make most efficient use of them Besides I didnt want to
leave you alone

The younger saurian sniffed skeptically

                                   

Honestly Pitt Mrs Bernardi said keeping to leeward of the
tablecloth the lizardman was efficiently shaking out of the airlock
Ive never had aan employee as competent as you But the word she
had in mind of course was servant I do wish youd come back to
Earth with us

Perhaps you would compel me to come he suggested as Algol and the
mosquitobat entered into hot competition to catch the crumbs before
they sank into the purple ooze

Oh no Wed want you to come as our guestour friend Naturally
her thoughts ran a house guest would be expected to help with the
washing up and lend a hand with the cookingand of course we wouldnt
have to pay him Though my husband I suppose would requisition him as
a specimen

I fully intend to go to Earth with them JrannPttt mused but
certainly not in that capacity Nor would I care to be a specimen I
must formulate some concrete plan

The captain was crawling on top of the spaceship scraping off the dried
mud brushing away the leaves and dust that marred its shining purity
The hot humid haze that poured down from the yellow clouds made the
metal surface a little hell Yet it was hardly less warm on the other
side of the clearing where Miss Anspacher tried desperately to write up
her notes on a table that kept sinking into the spongy ground and
hindered by the thick wind that had arisen half an hour before and which
kept blowing her papers off The sweet odor of the flowers tucked in the
open neck of her already grimy white blouse suddenly sickened her and
she flung them into the mud

We wont be going back to Earth for a long time she called Gathering
up the purplestained papers she came toward the others little puffs
of mist rising at each step We like it here Lovely country

How could she think to please even the savage she fancied him to be by
such an inanity JrannPttt wondered No one could possibly like that
fetid swamp Or was it not so much that she was trying to please him as
convince herself Was there some reason the terrestrials had for needing
to like Venus It hovered on the edge of the womens minds If only it
would emerge completely he could pick it up but it lurked in the
shadows of their subconscious tantalizing him

Id like to know when were going to start putting up the shelters
Mrs Bernardi said pushing a streak of fogyellow hair out of her eyes
I cant stand being cooped up for another night on that ship

Youre planning to put up sheltersto live outside of the ship This
would seem to confirm his darkest suspicions Even a temporary
settlement would leave them too open to visitation from the commandant
What his attitude toward the aliens might be JrannPttt didnt know He
might consider them as specimens as enemies or as potential allies
What his attitude toward JrannPttt and his companion would be however
the saurian knew only too well Had they reported the lieutenants
demise immediately it was possible the commandant might have been
brought to believe it was an accident Now he would unquestionably think
JrannPttt had killed MerglytRuuu on purposewhich was not true how
was JrannPttt to know that the mud into which hed knocked the
lieutenant was quicksand

Anything against putting up shelters Captain Greenfield growled from
his perch

Monster the mosquitobat shrieked at the cat Monster Monster

                                   

There was a painfully embarrassed silence

The creature is not intelligent JrannPttt explained smiling It
merely has vocal apparatus that can reproduce a frequently heard word
likeyou have a bird I believe a he searched their minds for the
worda parrot

Monster the mosquitobat continued Monster Monster

Shut up or Ill wring your neck the captain snarled The mosquitobat
obeyed sullenly apparently recognizing the threat in his tone

But the concept of monster hung heavily in the air between the
terrestrials and the lizardman They should not feel so bad about it
he thought for they are the monsters themselves But that would never
occur to them and I can hardly reassure them by saying

Dont worry Professor Bernardi said smoothly To him its we who
are the monsters

A sudden gust of wind nearly whipped the tablecloth out of JrannPttts
hands He fought with it for a moment glad of something tangible to
contend with About the shelters he said They might not stand up
against a storm

So this is monsoon country Bernardi observed thoughtfully Do you
know when the storms usually come JrannPttt The other shook his
head Peculiar There usually is a season for that sort of thing

I  come from another part of the planet

Storms here are bad eh the captain commented swinging himself down
easily Frankly that worries me Ships resting on mud as far as I can
see and if theres one thing I do know something about its mud If it
got any wetter the ship might sink

Maybe we should leave Mrs Bernardi suggested Go to another part of
the planet where its drier or she tried not to show the sudden
surge of hopeleave for home and come back after the rainy season

There was a sudden silence and JrannPttt found himself able to pick up
the answers to some of his questions from the alien minds His worst
fears were confirmed Plan A was out But something could still be done
with these creatures

Doesnt she know the captain demanded accusingly You brought her
here without telling her

Bernardi spread his hands wide in a futile gesture She should know
Ive told her repeatedly She just doesnt understand  or doesnt
want to

I know theyll forgive us Mrs Bernardi said stubbornly
Weyouhavent done anything really wrong so how could they do
anything terrible to us After all didnt they refuse you the funds
because they said you couldnt

Shhh Louisa her husband commanded

JrannPttt smiled to himself

do it she went on And you did So they were wrong and theyll
have to forgive us

Tcha Miss Anspacher said Since when was there any fairness in
justice

On the other hand Mrs Bernardi continued we have no idea of how
dangerous the storms here could be

Very dangerous JrannPttt said

For you perhaps the captain retorted Maybe not for us

Now thats silly Miss Anspacher said You can see that JrannPttt is
much more she blushedsturdily built than we are

I dont mean that we could face it without protection the captain
replied angrily Naturally I mean that our superior technology could
cope with the effects of any storm

Well Captain well have to put that superior technology to use at
once the professor told him Youd better start blasting that rock

Laden with equipment and malevolent thoughts the captain trudged off
into the murky jungle The others would not even offer to help
Confounded scientists they certainly took his status as captain
seriously He wished for a disloyal moment that he had stayed on
Earth The quiet routine of a test pilot had prepared him for nothing
like this Were Miss Anspacher and adventure worth it At the moment he
thought not But he was on Venus and it was too late to change his mind

JrannPttt followed him into the jungle keeping some distance behind
for he had good reason to suspect that Greenfield would take his warm
interest in terrestrial technology for plain spying Or worse yet he
might try to press the lizardman into service JrannPttt felt he had
demeaned himself quite enough already

Have you noticed Miss Anspacher asked pushing the mass of damp brown
hair off her neck as she came alongside him how thethe smell a
scientist does not mince wordsof the swamp has grown stronger

JrannPttt halted He had a good idea of what the captains reactions to
the sight of himself and Miss Anspacher arriving handinhand would be
Yes it is getting rather overpowering Perhaps for a lady of your
delicate sensibilities it would be best to

I can stand a bad smell just as well as a maleany male

Perhaps even better JrannPttt said for I was on the verge of
turning back myself

Oh she said appeased Well in that case Ill go back with
you  how quiet everything is

He had not noticed For him it would never be quiet because of the
stream of jangled thoughts constantly pouring into the back of his mind
from everything sentient that surrounded him

For a moment he wondered what it would be like to be nontelepathic
like the terrestrials to have peace from the clamor of confused
impressions emotions and ideas that persistently beat at his mind But
that would be wondering how it was to be deaf to avoid discord or blind
to shut out ugliness

The lull before the storm I suppose she said brightly Now is his
opportunity to kiss meonly perhaps they dont have kissing in his
society His mouth does seem to be the wrong shape And if I kissed him
it might violate a taboo

During their short absence the citrine clouds that closed off the sky
had changed to a sinister umber It was now almost as dusky in the
clearing as in the jungle itself when JrannPttt and Miss Anspacher
returned and joined the others

Professor Bernardi stood looking up with sharp gray eyes at a sky he
could not see I hope Greenfield can finish the blasting more quickly
than he estimated he muttered

Will we hear the noise way out here Carl his wife worried nervously

Only two kilometers away Of course well hear it I do wish you
wouldnt always be asking such stupid questions

She shivered Well I hope they get it over with right away If we just
have to sit here waiting and waiting and waiting Ill go mad I know I
will

You should try to keep your nerves in check Louisa Miss Anspacher
snapped Silly little fool

At least I can control my glands Mrs Bernardi flared back
Sexstarved spinster

I shall make some tea ladies JrannPttt interposed Im sure we
will all feel the better for it

Mrs Bernardi smiled at him feebly Youre such a comfort Pitt I
dont know why you of all creatures should be the one to remind me of
home

Home remarked Mortland emerging from the airlock is where the
heart is Did I hear someone say tea

                                   

As JrannPttt hung the kettle over the fire suddenly the air erupted in
stunning violence of sound The ground undulated under their feet and
water slopped out of the kettle almost putting out the fire that rose
high to claw at it Rivulets of thick muddy liquid welled out of the
ground and drabbled their feet The women turned pale Algol gave a
faint cry and hid under Mrs Bernardis skirts trembling while the
mosquitobat tried to lift Mortlands toupee and hide in his hair The
ship itself quivered and seemed to jump slightly in the air then
returned to its resting place

All was quiet again quieter than it had been before Mortland anxiously
gnawed his light mustache Better hurry with that tea theres a good
fellow Im violently allergic to loud noises

Theyll probably continue all day the professor said with almost
malevolent cheerfulness so you might as well get used to them Who
is he to have nerves I am easily the most sensitive person here but I
manage to control myself

I dont know how Im going to stand it Mrs Bernardi shrieked I
just know something terrible is going to happen

Please try to restrain yourself Louisa her husband ordered After
its over youll find well be much more comfortable and secure with
the ship resting on rock

If you ask me that blast made it sink a little Mortland said I
wonder whether

He was interrupted by a thrashing in the bushes DfarLll burst forth
shedding scales Do not despair JrannPttt I am here ready to save
you or die at your side

The women clutched each other Miss Anspacher praying silently and
fervently to Juno Lakshmi Freya Isis and a host of other esoteric
female deities she had picked up in the course of her avocational
researches

He seems to be one of JrannPttts people Bernardi observed so
there should be nothing to fear

DfarLll you fool JrannPttt ideated angrily Nothings wrong
Theyre just blasting out a better berth for their vessel And now
youve spoiled my plans

What did you think at that poor little creature Mrs Bernardi blazed
Hes crying And sure enough amethyst tears were oozing out of the
young saurians large liquid eyes

I dudidnt mean any harm

Monster Mrs Bernardi accused JrannPttt All men are monsters
whether theyre aliens or not

Youre so right Louisa Miss Anspacher exclaimed regarding the
younger creature in an almost kindly manner

Im sorry rLll JrannPttt apologized I was upset by that noise
too How could you possibly know what it was Come let me introduce you
to the creatures

DfarLll stepped forward diffidently JrannPttt put a hand on the
mossgreen shoulder Allow me to introduce my companion DfarLll he
said aloud

The youngster looked at him

Mrs Bernardi thrust out her hand Im very glad to meet you Lil

Agitate it with one of yours Its a courtesy Dont let her see how
repulsive she is to you Remember youre just as repulsive to her

DfarLll offered a shy sevenfingered hand Pleased  to meet
you  maam the young lizard squeaked

Why hes just a baby isnt he Mrs Bernardi asked

I am not a baby DfarLll thought indignantly At the end of this
year I shall celebrate my prematurity feast or I would have And
furthermore

There was another thunderous blast of sound After the ground had
stopped trembling the six found themselves ankledeep in muddy water
Algol who was in considerably deeper than his ankles mewed fretfully
Mrs Bernardi picked him up and comforted him

Perhaps blasting wasnt such a good idea the professor muttered
Maybe I should tell Greenfield to call a halt and well take our
chances with the storm As a matter of fa

The ship Mortland cried It is sinking

And the big metal ball slowly but visibly was indeed subsiding into the
mud

Stop it somebody Miss Anspacher snapped in her customary schoolroom
manner

The professor was pale but he held on to his calm What can we do
Even if we could get the captain back in time theres no way we can
stop it Its too heavy to pull out manually and the engines of
course are inside

As they watched in horror the ship sank deeper and deeper picking up
momentum as more of it went under With a loud sucking sound it
vanished into the ooze Muddy water gurgled over it and where the ship
had been there was now a small lake

This could be the beginning of a legend Miss Anspacher murmured Or
the end

There was another vibrant detonation Someone ought to go tell the
captain theres no use blasting any more Bernardi said wearily We
have nothing to put on the rock when he smooths it off He began to
laugh I suppose you could call this poetic justice And he went on
laughing losing a bit of his former selfcontrol

There goes Plan B JrannPttt thought

A star of intensely bright green lightning split the clouds and widened
to cover the visible expanse of sky There was a planetshaking clap of
thunder that made Greenfields puny efforts sound like the snapping of
twigs in comparison and it began to rain hard and fast

                                   

If only I hadnt gone and blasted that damn rock the captain
grumbled squeezing water out of his shirttails wed have been all
right Probably the storm wouldnt have done a thing to the ship except
get it wet If you can even call it a storm

I can and I do JrannPttt replied haughtily squeegeeing his wet
scales All I said was that a storm might be coming up and it might be
dangerous How was I to know it would last only half an hour

Even the camp stools pulled through Greenfield pointed out and you
said shelters wouldnt stand up

I only said they might not Cant you understand your own language

The fissure in the clouds had not quite closed yet and through it the
enormous blazing disk of the sun glared at them twice as large as it
appeared from Earth It was a moot point as to whether theyd be dried
out or steamed alive first

Might as well collect whatever gear we have left and get it to higher
ground Miss Anspacher said efficiently Two feet of water wont do
anything any goodeven those camp stools

Its my belief you wanted this to happen Greenfield accused
JrannPttt You wanted to get rid of us

My dear fellow JrannPttt replied loftily the information I gave
you was to the best of my knowledge accurate However I happen to be
a professor of zoology and not a meteorologist Apparently you people
live out in the open like primitives he continued ignoring DfarLlls
admiring interjection and are accustomed to the vicissitudes of
weather I am a civilized creature I live or used to livein an
airconditioned lightconditioned weatherconditioned city It is only
when I rough it on field trips like this to trackless parts of
theglobe that I am forced to experience weather Even then I have
never before been caught in a situation like this

In fact I was never before caught or I wouldnt be in this situation
at all

Oh JrannPttt sighed Miss Anspacher I knew you couldnt be just an
ordinary native

How did you get into this situation then Professor Bernardi asked He
had an unfortunate talent for going directly to the point

The third member of our expedition died JrannPttt explained He was
our dirigational expert Our guide

How did he happen to

Are we just going to stand here chatting Miss Anspacher demanded or
are we going to do something about this

What can we do Mrs Bernardi asked weakly We might just as well lie
down and

Never say die Louisa Miss Anspacher admonished

I suggest we go to my camp to see what shape its in JrannPttt said
furiously putting together Plan C Some of the supplies there might
prove useful

Captain Greenfield looked questioningly at Bernardi The professor
shrugged Might as well

All right the captain growled Lets pick up whatever we can save

                                   

Since there wasnt much that could be rescued the little safari was
soon on its way JrannPttt led carrying Algol in his arms Behind came
Mortland bearing a camp stool and the kettle into which he had tucked a
tin of biscuits and into which the mosquitobat had tucked itself its
orange eyes glaring out angrily from beneath the lid Next came Mrs
Bernardi with her knitting her camp stool and her sorrow

DfarLll followed with two stools and the plastic tea set Close behind
was Miss Anspacher with the sugar bowl the earthenware teapot and an
immense bound volume of the Proceedings of the Physical Society of
Ameranglis for  Professor Bernardi bore a briefcase full of notes
and the table The rain had damaged the latters mechanism so that its
legs kept unfolding from time to time to the great inconvenience of
Captain Greenfield who brought up the rear with the blasting equipment
Behind them and sometimes alongside them came somethingor
someoneelse

Illustration

Surely your camp must have been closer to ours than this Miss
Anspacher finally remarked after they had been slogging through mud and
water and pushing aside reluctant vegetation for over an Earth hour

I am very much afraid JrannPttt admitted that our camp has been
lostthat is to say inundated

What are we going to do now the captain asked of the company at
large

Professor Bernardi shrugged Our only course would seem to be making
for one of the cities and throwing ourselves upon the naJrannPttts
peoples hospitality If Professor JrannPttt has even the vaguest idea
of the direction in which his home lies we might as well head that
way I wonder whether the natives could help us raise the ship

Im sure my people will be more than happy to welcome you JrannPttt
said smoothly and to make you comfortable until your people send
another ship to fetch you

The terrestrials looked at one another DfarLll looked at JrannPttt

Professor Bernardi coughed That was the only spaceship we had he
admitted The first experimental model you know We dont expect to
stay on this awful planet forever After all as Louisa says the
government will have to forgive us Public opinion and all that

Oh the saurian said Then we shall have the pleasure of your company
until they build another

There was silence We have the only plans the professor said
gripping his briefcase more tightly I am the inventor of the ship so
naturally I would have them If we brought back some specimens of
Venusian lifeof intelligent Venusian lifeto prove wed been
here

Matter of fact old fellow Mortland said we took all the plans with
us so they couldnt build another ship and follow

Mortland the professor exclaimed

But theyre telepaths Miss Anspacher said They must know already

Everyone turned to look at the saurians

I have  certain information JrannPttt admitted but I cannot
understand it You are in trouble with your rulers because they would
not give you the funds claiming space travel was impossible

Thats right Bernardi said Not really specimens you understand
Guests

And you went ahead and appropriated the funds and materials from your
government since you were in a trusted position where you could do so

Bernardi nodded

Of course the question is now academic for the ship is gone but since
you proved the possibility of space travel by coming here wouldnt your
government then dismiss the charges against you

Thats exactly what I keep telling him Mrs Bernardi exclaimed

But her husband shook his head The law is inflexible We have broken
it and must be punished even if by breaking it we proved its
fundamental error Why let him know our plans

Why JrannPttt that sounds just like our own government doesnt it

Yes it does We should be able to establish a very satisfactory mode
of living with these strangers

Wed hoped that after a year or so the whole thing would die down
Mortland explained frankly and wed go back as heroes

Do you know the way to your home JrannPttt the professor asked
anxiously

Since we were able to catch a glimpse of the sun I think I can figure
out roughly where we are All we must do is walk some two hundred
kilometers in that direction he waved an arm to indicate the
wayand we should be at the capital

Will your people accept us as refugees Miss Anspacher demanded
bluntly or will we be captives Which is what Ill bet the good
professor is planning for you if only he can figure some way to get you
and of course ourselves back

We should be proud to accept you as citizens and to receive the
benefits of your splendid technology Our laboratories will be placed at
your disposal

Well thats better than we hoped for the professor said
brightening We had expected to have to carve our own laboratories out
of the wilderness Now we shall be able to carry on our researches in
comfort No need to trouble the natives well be able to raise the
ship ourselves Or build a new one And Ill see to it personally that
they have special quarters in the zoo with a considerable amount of
privacy

If I were you I wouldnt trust him too far the captain warned Hes
a foreigner

You ought to be ashamed of yourself Captain Miss Anspacher said
I for one trust JrannPttt implicitly Did you say this direction
JrannPttt She stepped forward briskly There was a loud splash and
water closed over her head

Captain Greenfield rushed forward to haul her out Well she said
daintily coughing up mud I was wet to begin with anyway

Youre a brave little woman Miss Anspacher the captain told her
admiringly

This sort of thing may present a problem Professor Bernardi
commented I hope that was only a pothole that the water is not going
to be consistently too deep for wading

There might be quicksand too Mrs Bernardi said somberly In
quicksand one drowns slowly

DfarLll gave a start Surely you dont intend to lead them back to
base

Precisely The swamp is unfit for settlement

But to return voluntarily to captivity

Who mentioned anything about captivity Assisted by our new friends we
have an excellent chance of taking over the ship and supplies by a
surprise attack

But why should these aliens assist us

JrannPttt smiled Oh I think they will Yes I have every confidence
in Plan C

I suggest the professor said ignoring his wifes pessimism that
each one of us pull a branch from a tree We can test the ground before
we step on it to make sure that there is solid footing underneath

Good idea the captain approved He reached out the arm that was not
occupied with Miss Anspacher and tugged at a tree limb

And then he and the lady physicist were both floundering in the ooze

Well really Captain Greenfield she cried refusing his aid in
extricating herself I always thought you were at least a gentleman in
spite of your illiteracy

Whawhat happened he asked as he struggled out of the mud
Something pushed me I swear it

JrannPttt mentalized It seems the tree did not like your trying to
remove a branch

The tree Greenfields pale blue eyes bulged Youre joking

Not at all As a matter of fact I myself have been wondering why there
were so many thoughtstreams and yet so few animals around here It
never occurred to me that the vegetation could be sentient and have such
strong emotive defenses In all my experience as a botanist I

I thought you were a zoologist Bernardi interrupted

My people do not believe in excessive specialization the saurian
replied

Trees that think Mortland inquired incredulously

Theyre not very bright JrannPttt explained but they dont like
having their limbs pulled off I dont suppose you would either for
that matter

I propose Miss Anspacher said shaking out her wet hair that we
break up the camp stools and use the sticks instead of branches to help
us along

Good idea the captain said trying to get back into her good graces
I always knew women could put their brains to use if they tried

She glared at him

I thought wed use the furniture to make a fire later Mortland
complained For tea you know

The grounds much too wet Professor Bernardi replied

And besides Miss Anspacher added I lost the teapot in that
pothole

But you managed to save the Proceedings of the Physical Society
Mortland snarled Serve you right if I eat it And I warn you if
hardpressed I shall

How will we cook our food though Mrs Bernardi demanded
apprehensively Its a lucky thing Mr Pitt that we have you with us
to tell us which of the berries and things are edible so at least we
shant starve

The visible portion of JrannPttts wellknit form turned deeper green
But I regret to say I dont know Mrs Bernardi Those native foods I
served you were all synthetics from our personal stores I never tasted
natural foods before I met you

And if the trees dont like our taking their branches Miss Anspacher
put in I dont suppose the bushes would like our taking their berries
Louisa dont do that

But Mrs Bernardi with her usual disregard for orders had fainted into
the mud Pulling her out and reviving her caused so much confusion it
wasnt until then that they discovered Algol had disappeared

                                   

The party had been trudging through mud and water and struggling with
pale malevolent vines and bushes and lowhanging branches for close to
six Earth hours All of them were tired and hungry now that their
meager supply of biscuits and chocolate was gone

Remember Carl Mrs Bernardi told her husband I forgive you And I
know Im being foolishly sentimental but if you could manage to take my
body back to Earth

Dont be so pessimistic Professor Bernardi absentmindedly leaned
against a tree then recoiled as he remembered it might resent being
treated like an inanimate object In any case well most likely all
die at the same time

I never did want to go to Venus really Mrs Bernardi sniffled I
only came like Algol did because I didnt have any choice If you left
me behind Id have had to bear the brunt of Where is Algol She
stared at JrannPttt You were carrying him What have you done with
him

The lizardman looked at her in consternation He jumped out of my arms
when you fainted and I turned back to help I was certain one of the
others had him

Hes dead she wailed You let him fall into the water and drownan
innocent kitty that never hurt anybody except in fun

Come come Louisa Her husband took her arm He was only a cat Im
sure JrannPttt didnt mean for him to drown He was just so upset by
your fainting that he didnt think

Not JrannPttts fault of course Miss Anspacher said

After all we cant expect them to love animals as we do But Algol was
a very good sort of cat

Keep quiet all of you JrannPttt shouted I have never known any
species to use any method of communication so much in order to
communicate so little Dont you understand I would not have assumed
the cat was with one of you if I had not subconsciously sensed his
thoughtstream all along He must be nearby

Everyone was still while JrannPttt probed the dense underbrush that
blocked their view on both sides Over here he announced and led the
way through the thick screen of interlaced bushes and vines on the left

About ten meters farther on the ground sloped up sharply to form a
ridge rising a meter and a half above the rest of the terrain The water
had not reached its blunted top and on this fairly level strip of
ground perhaps three meters wide Algol had been paralleling their path
in drypawed comfort

Scientists Louisa Bernardi almost spat Professors We could have
been walking on that too But did anybody think to look for dry
ground No It was wet in one place so it would be wet in another Oh
Algol she reached over to embrace the catyoure smarter than any
socalled intelligent lifeforms

He indignantly straightened a whisker she had crumpled

                                   

Look Mortland exclaimed in delight as they attained the top of the
ridge here are some dryish twigs Dont suppose the trees want them
since theyve let them fall If I can get a fire going we could boil
some swamp water and make tea Nasty thought but its better than no
tea at all And how long can one go on living without tea

Well need some food before long too Professor Bernardi observed
putting his briefcase down on a fallen log The usual procedure I
believe would be for us to draw straws to see which gets
eatenalthough there isnt any hurry

Im glad then that well be able to have a fire Mortland said busily
collecting twigs I should hate to have to eat you raw Carl

Mr Pitt and his little friend are delightful creatures Mrs Bernardi
thought So intelligent and so well behaved But eating them wouldnt
really be cannibalism They arent people

That premise works both ways dear lady JrannPttt ideated And I
must say your species will prove far easier to peel for the cooking
pot

Monster What are you doing Mortland dropped his twigs and pulled the
mosquitobat away from a bush Dont eat those berries you silly ass
the bush wont like it The mosquitobat piped wrathfully

JrannPttt probed with intentness You know I rather think the bush
wants its berries to be eaten Something to do witherpropagating
itself Of course it has a false impression as to what is going to be
done with the berries but the important fact is that it wont put up
any resistance

All right old fellow Mortland released the mosquitobat which
promptly flew back to the bush Im not the custodian of your morals

I wonder whether we could eat those berries too Professor Bernardi
remarked pensively

Carl Mrs Bernardis tearstained face flushed pink Whywhy
thats almost indecent

We eat beans dont we Mortland pointed out Theyre seeds

We also eat meat Miss Anspacher added

There was silence I imagine Mrs Bernardi murmured its because
we never get to meet the meat socially She avoided the saurians eyes

Wed better see how Monster makes out though Miss Anspacher
observed replenishing her lipstick before we try the berries
ourselves The fact that the bush is anxious to dispose of them doesnt
mean they cant be poisonous

Why should Monster sacrifice himself for us Mortland retorted hotly
overlooking the fact that Monsters purpose in eating the berries was
almost certainly not an altruistic one If we can risk his life we can
risk our own He crammed a handful of berries into his mouth defiantly
I say theyre good

Algol sniffed the bush with disgust then turned away

See said Miss Anspacher Theyre undoubtedly poisonous When hes
really hungry he isnt so fussy She combed her hair

But is he really hungry Bernardi asked suspiciously Come here
Algol Nice kitty He bent down and sniffed the cats breath The cat
sniffed his interestedly Their whiskers touched I thought so Fish

You mean Mrs Bernardi shrieked that while we were struggling
through that water alternately starving and drowning by centimeters
that wretched cat has not only been walking along here dry as toast but
gorging himself on fish

Now now Mrs Bernardi JrannPttt said Being a dumb animal he
wouldnt think of informing you about matters of which hed assume that
you as the superior beings would be fully cognizant

You might have told us there were fish on this planet Mr Pitt

Dear lady there is something I feel I should tell you I am not

Theyre here on the other side of the ridge Greenfield called
bending over and peering through the foliage The fish I mean

The pools look shallow Bernardi said also bending over The fish
should be easy enough to catch Might even be able to get them in our
hands He reached out to demonstrate proving the error of both his
theses for the fish slipped right through his fingers and as he
grabbed for them he lost his balance toppled over the side of the
ridge into the mud and water below and began to disappear showing
beyond a doubt that the pools were deeper than he had thought

Carl what are you doing Mrs Bernardi peered into the murky depths
where her husband was threshing about Why dont you come out of that
filthy mud

His voice though muffled was still acid It isnt mud my dear Its
quicksand

Rope the captain exclaimed grabbing a coil

Hold on chaps cried a squeaky voice Im coming to the rescue A
stout twelvefoot vine plunged out of the shadows and wrapped one end of
itself around a treedisregarding the latters violent objectionsand
the other end around Professor Bernardis thorax which was just
disappearing into the mud Now if one or two of you would haul away
well soon have him out all shipshape and proper Heave ho Dont be
afraid of hurting me my strength is as the strength of ten because my
heart is pure

Its that vine DfarLll exclaimed So thats what has been following
us all along

                                   

I can accept the idea of a vegetable thinking Professor Bernardi
gasped as he was pulled out of the quicksand although with the utmost
reluctance He shook himself like a dog But how can it be mobile

You chaps can move around the vine explained so I said to myself
Dammit Ill have a shot at doing that too Hard going at first when
youre using suckers but I persevered and I made it Look I can talk
too Never heard of a vine doing that before did you Fact is I hadnt
thought of it before but then I never had anyone to communicate with
All those other vines are so stupid you have absolutely no idea Hope
you dont mind my picking up your language but it was the only one
around

We are honored Professor Bernardi declared And I am deeply grateful
to you too sir or madam for saving my life

Think nothing of it the vine said arranging its leaves which were
of a pleasing celadon rather than the whitishgreen favored by the rest
of the local vegetation Now that I can move Ill probably be doing
heroic things like that all the time Are you all going to the city May
I go with you Ive heard lots about the city it went on taking
consent for granted but I never thought Id get to see it Everybody
in the swamp is such an old stickinthemud I thought I was trapped
too forced to spend the rest of my life in a provincial environment Is
it true that the streets are filled with chlorophyll Do you think I can
get a job in a botanical garden or something Perhaps I can give little
talks on horticulture to visitors

The mosquitobat looked out of the tea kettle austerely Monster it
piped shrilly

The very idea the vine snapped back indignantly Oh well it said
calming down you probably dont know any better Its up to me as the
intelligent lifeform to forgive you and I shall

JrannPttt and DfarLll looked at each other in consternation Do you
think there really are cities on this planet sir Can there be
indigenous intelligent life If so it may have already got in touch
with the commandant

Impossible JrannPttt replied The vine probably just heard us
talking about a city After all it picked up the language that way
very likely it absorbed some terrestrial concepts along with it If
there are any real settlements at all they must be quite
primitivenothing more than villages No its we who will build the
cities on Venus Combining our technology with the terrestrials we
could develop a pretty little civilization hereafter weve disposed of
the commandant so he cant report our disappearance We dont want any
publicity So much better to keep our little society exclusive

                                   

Wonder what time it is the captain remarked as he rose and stretched
in the dim yellow light of the long Venusian day Must have slept for
hours My watch seems to have stopped

Mine too Mortland unstrapped his from his wrist and shook it
futilely Waterproof hah If we ever get back to Earth I shall make
the manufacturer eat his guarantee

Oh well what does time matter to us now Professor Bernardi pointed
out as he rose from his leafy couch with a loud creak All of themeven
the saurianshad aches and pains in every joint and muscle as a result
of the unaccustomed exercise and the damp climate We are out of its
reach It has no present meaning for us

This depressed them all Only the vine seemed in good health and
spirits I notice youre all wearing clothes except for the short
fourlegged gentleman with the homegrown fur coat it chattered
happily Do you think Ill be socially acceptable without them I
wouldnt want to make a bad impression at the very startor would
leaves do

Everybody looked at JrannPttt We are not a narrowminded species he
said hastily Im sure your leaves will be more than adequate

After a breakfast of fish and berries stewed in teawhich the vine
declined with thanksthe various members of the party gathered up
their belongings and resumed their journey Encrusted with dried purple
mud and grime their clothes deliberately torn by antisocial shrubbery
their chinsof the males that isdisfigured by hirsute growths the
terrestrials made a sorry spectacle It was hot boiling hot and more
humid than ever

Well said Miss Anspacher letting the Swahili marching song with
which she had been attempting to encourage the company peter out I do
hope well reach your city soon JrannPttt I must say I could use a
hot bath She added hastily Hot baths are a peculiar cultural trait
of ours

I could use one myself JrannPttt said He brushed his scales
fastidiously

Im looking forward so to meeting your relatives she said grabbing
his left arm determinedly Im not violating a taboo or anything am
I It isnt really slimy it just feels that way

Not one of my peoples But Im afraid you are violating a terrestrial
taboo judging from the thoughts I pick up from your captains mind

Oh himhes a stupid fool

Not at all Rough perhaps Untutored yes But with a good deal of
native intelligence although fearfully primitive

Perhaps I was too harsh Miss Anspacher observed thoughtfully The
captain  is goodlooking in a brutal sort of way although not nearly
as handsome or even as spiritual in appearance as JrannPttt And
sometimes I almost think heshe blushed to herselfshows a certain
partiality for my company

She did not however let go of the saurians arm when the captain
bustled up prepared to put a stop to this but tactfully if possible
for he had begun to realize that his rude ways did not endear him to
her

Ahwere making very good progress arent we Pitt he interrupted
trying to insinuate himself between the two

Excellent

How soon do you think well be at your city at this rate

JrannPttt shrugged Since I have no way of telling what our rate is or
how far we have gone how can I tell As a matter of fact you might as
well learn now as laterI am not a Venusian There is no intelligent
life native to Venus

Oh really the vine interposed indignantly Saying a thing like that
right in front of me What would you call me then pray tell

JrannPttt kept his actual thoughts to himself A mutation he said
Probably you are the first intelligent lifeform to appear upon this
planet Scholarly volumes will be written about you

Oh The vine seemed to be appeased I accept your apology Perhaps
Ill learn to write and do the books myself because Im the only one
who can understand the real me

But how can you show us the way to your city if youre not native to
Venus Bernardi demanded whirling fretfully upon the saurian What is
this anyway Each time you come up with a different story

See said the captain Didnt I tell you he was up to no good

I should like to lead you to our base JrannPttt replied with quiet
dignity I am telling you the truth now since I feel I should have your
consent before proceeding farther

 DfarLll projected

I hesitated before because I wasnt sure I could trust you You
see the spaceship in which we came to this planet is a prison ship
with a crew consisting of malefactorsthieves murderers
defraudersdispatched to the remote fastnesses of the Galaxy to fetch
back zoological specimens Our zoo I must say is the finest and most
interesting in the Universe

Monster the mosquitobat squeaked

Shhh Mortland admonished Dont interrupt

I was in command of our illfated expedition

Oh DfarLll projected For a moment there sir you had me worried

When we reached Venus I was I must admit careless I gave the crew a
chance to mutiny and they did Slew most of the officers DfarLll and I
were lucky to escape with our lives

But you might have told us Mrs Bernardis voice held reproach

Until we knew what kind of beings you were we couldnt let you know
how helpless and unprotected we were

The women seemed moved but not the men

Leading us on a wild goose chase were you the captain challenged

JrannPttt drew a deep breath It was my hope that all of you would
consent to help us get our ship back from these criminals Then we could
fly to my planetwhich is the fifth of the star you know as Alpha
Centauriwhere I assure you you would be hospitably received

We arent really going back home JrannPttt are we Id sooner stay
here in the swamp than go back to that jail

Have confidence in me rLll As soon as we have disposed of the
commandant and his officers I can put our ship out of commission The
terrestrials wont be able to tell whats wrong They know nothing about
space travel The fact that they got their crude vessel to operate was
probably sheer luck

But the younger was not to be diverted Will we kill them after weve
disposed of our officers I should hate to

Certainly not We shall need servants and I dont trust the prisoners
in the shipall criminals of the lowest type Aloud he said to the
bewildered terrestrials If you dont want to help us I shall
understand No sense your interfering in another species quarrels
particularly as we must seem like monsters to you

Monster the mosquitobat agreed Monster monster monster No one
tried to stop him JrannPttt sensed that somehow he had lost a good
deal of his grip on the terrestrials Finesse he thought angrily was
wasted on these barbaric lifeforms

Bernardi sighed I suppose well have to help you No reason why his
ship shouldnt stop off at Earth before it goes to Alpha Centauri No
reason why it should even go to Alpha Centauri at all in fact

If you ask me the captain said hes one of the criminals himself

But nobody asked you Miss Anspacher retorted the more acidly because
she had been wondering the same thing Shall we resume our journey

Hold on the vine said I dont want to intrude or anything but it
hasnt been made quite clear to me whether or not Im included in the
invitation to this Alpha Centauri place and I wouldnt want to keep
going only on the offchance that you might ask me I really think you
should because you led me astray with your fair promises of glittering
cities

The cities of our planet do not glitter JrannPttt replied wishing
it would wither instantly but certainly you are invited Glad to have
you

Oh thats awfully decent of you the vine said emotionally I shant
forget it I promise you

                                   

They plodded onward the vine chattering so incessantly that a faint
gurgling which accompanied them went unnoticed The gurgling grew louder
and louder as they pushed on Finally I keep hearing water Mortland
remarked We must be approaching a river of some kind

A few minutes later bursting through a screen of underbrush they found
themselves confronted by a river whose bubbling violetblue waters
extended for at least four kilometers from shadowy bank to bank with
the ridge tapering to a point almost in its exact center

Apparently while they had been trekking along the elevation the
surrounding terrain concealed from them by the dense and evilminded
vegetation had imperceptibly taken off leaving the ridge to become a
peninsula that jutted out into the river They seemed to be stranded
All they could do was retrace their steps and since they had no idea
how far back the split became part of the mainland again the return
journey might last almost as long as it had taken them to get there

I know were heading in the right direction JrannPttt defended
himself I wasnt aware of the river because we must have come by an
overland route Although he was telling the truth at least insofar as
he knew it himself no one not even DfarLll believed him

But lets rest a bit before we turn back Mortland proposed flopping
to the ground Im utterly used up

Maybe we dont need to go back the vine said Not all the way
anyhow Everyone stared It waved its leaves brightly at them I
notice the captain thoughtfully brought along lots of rope and there
were scads of fallen logs just a bit back Couldnt you just lash the
logs together with the rope and make aa thing on which we could float
the rest of the way On the water you know

The others continued to look at it openmouthed

Just a little idea I had it said modestly May not amount to much
but then you cant tell until youve tried can you

Ithemeans a raft I think Mrs Bernardi said

JrannPttt probed the raft concept in her mind for he found the
vegetables mental processes curiously obscure What an excellent
idea he exclaimed

It does not seem infeasible Professor Bernardi admitted tightly By
now he was suspicious of everyone and everything If I had never
broached the idea of space travel to those peasants he thought I
would be on Earth in the dubious comfort of my own home Thats what
comes of trying to help humanity

                                   

Well observed the captain as the heavy raft hit the water with a
tremendous splash she seems to be riverworthy He rubbed his hands in
anticipation much of his surliness gone now that he was about to deal
with something he understood Since she is in a manner of speaking a
ship I suppose I assume command again He waited for objections
glancing involuntarily in JrannPttts direction There were none
Right he said repressing any outward symptoms of relief

He efficiently deployed the personnel to the positions on the raft where
he felt they might be least useless the gear being piled in the middle
and surmounted by Algol who naturally assumed possession of the softest
and safest place by the divine right of cats

The captain does have a commanding presence Miss Anspacher thought
and a sort of uncouth grace Moreover he cannot read my mindin fact
he often cannot even understand me when I speak

All right he bellowed Cast off

The vine unfastened the rope that it had insouciantly attached to a tree
trunk remarking to the others Dont let the trees intimidate you
Actually their bark is worse than their bite Now it dropped lithely on
board the raft looking for a comfortable resting place

Please dont twine around me Miss Anspacher said coldly If you
insist upon coming with us you will have to choose an inanimate object
to cling to

All right all right it tried to soothe her No need to get yourself
all worked up over such a mere triviality is there Ill just coil
myself tidily around one of those spare logs I must say youre warmer
though

Yes she is isnt she thought the captain and squeezed her hand

                                   

The raft drifted down the river Since the current was flowing in the
desired direction there did not appear to be any need to use the poles
and everyone sat or reclined as comfortably as possible in the
suffocating heat The yellow haze had become so thick that they seemed
to be at the bottom of a custard cup

Illustration

I do hope were heading the right way Professor Bernardi said
although who knows what is right and what is wrong any more

Perhaps we arent Mrs Bernardi mused stroking Algol who had
crawled into her lap Perhaps we will go drifting along endlessly
Every sixteen days it will get dark and every sixteen days it will get
light and meanwhile we will continue floating along never going
anywhere never getting anywhere never seeing anything but haze and
raft and river and each other Algol wheezed in his sleep

Nonsense JrannPttt said rudely I have a compass I know the
direction perfectly well

And yet you let us think we were wandering about blindly Miss
Anspacher gave him a contemptuous look The captain pressed her hand

Since you seem to breathe the same air and eat much the same food that
we do Mr Pitt Mrs Bernardi changed her tack I suppose well be
physically comfortable on your planet for the rest of our lives Our
children will be born there and our childrens children and eventually
theyll forget all about Earth and think it was only a legend

But you did expect to settle permanently on Venus didnt you the
vine asked bewilderedly Or for a long visit anyway So I dont
really see that it makes much difference if you go to JrannPttts Alpha
Centauri place So much nicer to be living with friends I should
think

But Alpha Centauri is so very far away Mrs Bernardi sighed There
wouldnt be much chance of our ever getting back

Look Mortland exclaimed The rivers branching Which fork do we
take

                                   

JrannPttt who had been dabbling his arms idly in the translucent
violetblue water withdrew them hastily as nine green eyes obviously
belonging to the same individual rose to the surface and regarded him
with more than casual interest He consulted his compass Left

Contrarily the mosquitobat suddenly squeaked pointing a small rod
at his companions Rightward

There was a stunned silence

Monster Mortland cried in reproach You can talk How could you
deceive us like that

Can talk the creature retorted Me not intelligent lifeform ha
Who talks last talks best Have not linguistic facility of inferior
lifeforms but can communicate rudely in your language

Remember Mortland cautioned there are ladies present

Have been lying low and laughing to selfha haat witlessness of
lowerly lifeforms

But why Mrs Bernardi demanded distractedly Havent we been kind to
you

You be likewise well treated in our zoo it assured her All of you
Our zoo finest in Galaxy And clean too

Now really sir I must protest Professor Bernardi began trying to
extricate a blaster unobtrusively from the pile of gear in which the
tooconfident terrestrials had cached their weapons

Monster gestured with his rod This is lethal weapon Do not try
hindrancing me Hate damage fine specimens Captain go rightward

Oh is that so Greenfield retorted hotly Let me tell you youyou
insect

George Miss Anspacher clutched his arm Do what it says For my
sake George

Oh all right he muttered Just for you then Told you not to trust
any of em he went on reluctantly poling the raft in the ordered
direction Foreigners

Fine zoo the mosquitobat insisted Very clean Run with utmost
efficientness Strict visiting hours

                                   

And there goes Plan D the vine said lightly There was a hint of
laughter in its voice JrannPttt stared at it in consternation Are
you also from the Alpha Centauri system sir It turned its attention
to the mosquitobat Naturally Im curious to know where Im going it
explained since I seem definitely to be included in your gracious
invitation

Alpha Centauri hah the mosquitobat snorted I from what Earthlets
laughingly term Sirius Alpha Centauri merely little star

Now see here JrannPttt sprang to his feet Criminal he might be but
he was not going to sit there and have his sun insulted

Gentlemen Gentlemen Miss Anspacher cried No use getting yourself
killed JrannPttt

Correctly Monster approved Elementary intelligence displayed Why
damage fine specimens

From one prison into another the saurian mentalized bitterly

Yes returned DfarLll and its all your fault The junior lizard
burst into tears I wish I had let MerglytRuuu do what he wanted I
would have been better off

Sirius the vine repeated Thats even farther away than Alpha
Centauri isnt it I never thought I would get that far away from the
swamp This really will be an adventure

How do you know Professor Bernardi began

Frankly it went on I dont see why you chaps are so put out by the
whole thing Whats the difference between Alpha Centauri and Sirius
anyway Matter of a few lightyears but otherwise a stars a star for
all that

To JrannPttt we wouldnt have been specimens Mrs Bernardi said
belatedly recognizing the advantages of Alpha Centauri

No not specimens the vine told her easily I dont suppose you know
he had no intention of taking you back to his system He wanted you to
help him kill the officers of his ship so they couldnt look for him and
the other escaped prisoner or report back to his planet Then he was
going to put the ship out of commission and found his own colony here
with you as his slaves Id just as soon be a specimen as a slave
Sooner Better to reign in a zoo than serve in a swamp

Just how do you know all this Miss Anspacher demanded

Its obvious enough Bernardi said gloomily Another telepath How
can we compete or even cope with creatures like these What a fool I
was to think I could outwit them

Telepathy just tricksomeness the mosquitobat put in jealously I
have no telepathy yet superior to all

But why should Mr Pitt want to kill his officers Mrs Bernardi asked
querulously Hes the commandant isnt he Or is he a professor I
never got that straight

He was one of the criminals on the ship the vine told her What you
might call a confidence man This is about the only system in the Galaxy
where he isnt wanted He did tell you the truth though when he said
they were sent on an expedition to collect zoological specimens
Dangerous work it sighed and so his people use criminals for it
They were sent out in small detachments Our friend here killed his
guard in a fight over a female prisoner which was why

But what happened to the female prisoner Miss Anspachers eye caught
DfarLlls Oh no she gasped

Why not DfarLll demanded Im as much of a female as you are Maybe
even more

The captain leaned close to Miss Anspacher No one can be more feminine
than you are Dolores he whispered

But heshes so young Mrs Bernardi wailed

The vine made an amused sound Dont you have juvenile delinquents on
Earth

Oh what does all that matter now JrannPttt said sullenly Were
all going to a Sirian zoo anyway

Correctly approved the monsterbat Finest zoo Clean Commodious
cages Reasonable visiting hours Very nice

Mrs Bernardi began to cry

Now the vine comforted her a zoos not so bad After all most of
us spend our lives in cages of one kind or another and without the
basic security a zoo affords

But we dont know were in cages Mrs Bernardi sobbed Thats the
important thing

Professor Bernardi looked at the vine But why are you he began
then halted Perhaps I dont want an answer he said There was no
hope at all left in him now that there was no doubt

You are wise the vine agreed quietly Algol arose from Mr Bernardis
lap and rubbed against its thick pale green stem He knew The
mosquitobat looked at both of them restlessly

The yellow haze had deepened to old gold Now it was beginning to turn
brown

Its twilight Miss Anspacher observed Soon it will be dark

Perhaps well sail right past his ship in the night Mortland
suggested hopefully

The mosquitobat gave a snort Ship has lights All modern
convenients

Suddenly the air seemed to have grown chillycolder than it had any
right to be on that torrid planet All around them it was dark and very
quiet

I think I do see lights Mortland said

Must be ship Monster replied And somehow the rest of them could
sense the uneasiness in the thin piping alien voice Must be

Your ships a very large one then Bernardi commented as they rounded
a bend and a whole colony of varicolored pastel lights sprang up ahead
of them

Not my ship the mosquitobat exclaimed in a voice pierced with
anguish Not my ship

Before them rose the fantastic twisting convoluting turning spires of
a tall marvelous glittering city

You will find that the streets actually are filled with chlorophyll
the vine said And I know youll be happy here all of you You see we
cant have you going back to your planets now No matter how good your
intentions were youd destroy us You do see that dont you

You may be right Bernardi agreed dispiritedly although that doesnt
cheer us any But what will you do with us

Youll be provided with living quarters comparable to those on your own
planets the vine told him and youll give lectures just as if you
were in a universityonly youll be much more secure I assure you
its voice was very gentle nowyoull hardly know youre in a zoo
