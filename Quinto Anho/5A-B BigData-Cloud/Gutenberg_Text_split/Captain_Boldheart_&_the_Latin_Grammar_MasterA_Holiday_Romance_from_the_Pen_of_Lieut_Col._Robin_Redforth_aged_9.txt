CAPTAIN BOLDHEART AND THE LATINGRAMMAR MASTER


The subject of our present narrative would appear to have devoted
himself to the Pirate profession at a comparatively early age We find
him in command of a splendid schooner of one hundred guns loaded to the
muzzle ere yet he had had a party in honour of his tenth birthday

It seems that our hero considering himself spited by a
LatinGrammarMaster demanded the satisfaction due from one man of
honour to another Not getting it he privately withdrew his haughty
spirit from such low company bought a secondhand pocketpistol folded
up some sandwiches in a paper bag made a bottle of Spanish
liquoricewater and entered on a career of valour

It were tedious to follow Boldheart for such was his name through the
commencing stages of his history Suffice it that we find him bearing
the rank of Captain Boldheart reclining in full uniform on a crimson
hearthrug spread out upon the quarterdeck of his schooner the Beauty
in the China Seas It was a lovely evening and as his crew lay grouped
about him he favoured them with the following melody

     O landsmen are folly
     O Pirates are jolly
     O Diddleum Dolly
                      Di
         Chorus Heave yo

The soothing effect of these animated sounds floating over the waters
as the common sailors united their rough voices to take up the rich
tones of Boldheart may be more easily conceived than described

It was under these circumstances that the lookout at the masthead gave
the word Whales

All was now activity

Where away cried Captain Boldheart starting up

On the larboard bow sir replied the fellow at the masthead touching
his hat For such was the height of discipline on board of the Beauty
that even at that height he was obliged to mind it or be shot through
the head

Illustration His crew lay grouped around him

This adventure belongs to me said Boldheart Boy my harpoon Let
no man follow and leaping alone into his boat the captain rowed with
admirable dexterity in the direction of the monster

All was now excitement

He nears him said an elderly seaman following the captain through
his spyglass

He strikes him said another seaman a mere stripling but also with a
spyglass

He tows him towards us said another seaman a man in the full vigour
of life but also with a spyglass

In fact the captain was seen approaching with the huge bulk following
We will not dwell on the deafening cries of Boldheart Boldheart with
which he was received when carelessly leaping on the quarterdeck he
presented his prize to his men They afterwards made two thousand four
hundred and seventeen pound ten and sixpence by it

Ordering the sails to be braced up the captain now stood WNW The
Beauty flew rather than floated over the dark blue waters Nothing
particular occurred for a fortnight except taking with considerable
slaughter four Spanish galleons and a Snow from South America all
richly laden Inaction began to tell upon the spirits of the men
Captain Boldheart called all hands aft and said

My lads I hear there are discontented ones among ye Let any such
stand forth

After some murmuring in which the expressions Aye aye sir Union
Jack Avast Starboard Port Bowsprit and similar indications
of a mutinous undercurrent though subdued were audible Bill Boozey
captain of the foretop came out from the rest His form was that of a
giant but he quailed under the captains eye

What are your wrongs said the captain

Why dye see Captain Boldheart replied the towering mariner Ive
sailed man and boy for many a year but I never yet knowd the milk
served out for the ships companys teas to be so sour as tis aboard
this craft

Illustration THE RESCUE OF WILLIAM BOOZEY

At this moment the thrilling cry Man overboard announced to the
astonished crew that Boozey in stepping back as the captain in mere
thoughtfulness laid his hand upon the faithful pocketpistol which he
wore in his belt had lost his balance and was struggling with the
foaming tide

All was now stupefaction

But with Captain Boldheart to throw off his uniform coat regardless of
the various rich orders with which it was decorated and to plunge into
the sea after the drowning giant was the work of a moment Maddening
was the excitement when boats were lowered intense the joy when the
captain was seen holding up the drowning man with his teeth deafening
the cheering when both were restored to the main deck of the Beauty And
from the instant of his changing his wet clothes for dry ones Captain
Boldheart had no such devoted though humble friend as William Boozey

Boldheart now pointed to the horizon and called the attention of his
crew to the taper spars of a ship lying snug in harbour under the guns
of a fort

She shall be ours at sunrise said he Serve out a double allowance
of grog and prepare for action

All was now preparation

When morning dawned after a sleepless night it was seen that the
stranger was crowding on all sail to come out of the harbour and offer
battle As the two ships came nearer to each other the stranger fired a
gun and hoisted Roman colours Boldheart then perceived her to be the
LatinGrammarMasters bark Such indeed she was and had been tacking
about the world in unavailing pursuit from the time of his first taking
to a roving life

Boldheart now addressed his men promising to blow them up if he should
feel convinced that their reputation required it and giving orders that
the LatinGrammarMaster should be taken alive He then dismissed them
to their quarters and the fight began with a broadside from The Beauty
She then veered round and poured in another The Scorpion so was the
bark of the LatinGrammarMaster appropriately called was not slow to
return her fire and a terrific cannonading ensued in which the guns of
The Beauty did tremendous execution

The LatinGrammarMaster was seen upon the poop in the midst of the
smoke and fire encouraging his men To do him justice he was no
Craven though his white hat his short grey trousers and his long
snuffcoloured surtout reaching to his heelsthe selfsame coat in
which he had spited Boldheartcontrasted most unfavourably with the
brilliant uniform of the latter At this moment Boldheart seizing a
pike and putting himself at the head of his men gave the word to board

A desperate conflict ensued in the hammock nettingsor somewhere in
about that directionuntil the LatinGrammarMaster having all his
masts gone his hull and rigging shot through and through and seeing
Boldheart slashing a path towards him hauled down his flag himself
gave up his sword to Boldheart and asked for quarter Scarce had he
been put into the captains boat ere The Scorpion went down with all
on board

On Captain Boldhearts now assembling his men a circumstance occurred
He found it necessary with one blow of his cutlass to kill the Cook
who having lost his brother in the late action was making at the
LatinGrammarMaster in an infuriated state intent on his destruction
with a carvingknife

Captain Boldheart then turned to the LatinGrammarMaster severely
reproaching him with his perfidy and put it to his crew what they
considered that a master who spited a boy deserved

They answered with one voice Death

It may be so said the Captain but it shall never be said that
Boldheart stained his hour of triumph with the blood of his enemy
Prepare the cutter

The cutter was immediately prepared

Without taking your life said the Captain I must yet for ever
deprive you of the power of spiting other boys I shall turn you adrift
in this boat You will find in her two oars a compass a bottle of rum
a small cask of water a piece of pork a bag of biscuit and my Latin
grammar Go and spite the natives if you can find any

Deeply conscious of this bitter sarcasm the unhappy wretch was put into
the cutter and was soon left far behind He made no effort to row but
was seen lying on his back with his legs up when last made out by the
ships telescopes

A stiff breeze now beginning to blow Captain Boldheart gave orders to
keep her SSW easing her a little during the night by falling off a
point or two W by W or even by WS if she complained much He then
retired for the night having in truth much need of repose In addition
to the fatigues he had undergone this brave officer had received
sixteen wounds in the engagement but had not mentioned it

In the morning a white squall came on and was succeeded by other
squalls of various colours It thundered and lightened heavily for six
weeks Hurricanes then set in for two months Waterspouts and tornadoes
followed The oldest sailor on boardand he was a very old onehad
never seen such weather The Beauty lost all idea where she was and the
carpenter reported six feet two of water in the hold Everybody fell
senseless at the pumps every day

Provisions now ran very low Our hero put the crew on short allowance
and put himself on shorter allowance than any man in the ship But his
spirit kept him fat In this extremity the gratitude of Boozey the
captain of the foretop whom our readers may remember was truly
affecting The loving though lowly William repeatedly requested to be
killed and preserved for the captains table

We now approach a change in affairs

One day during a gleam of sunshine and when the weather had moderated
the man at the mastheadtoo weak now to touch his hat besides its
having been blown awaycalled out

Savages

All was now expectation

Presently fifteen hundred canoes each paddled by twenty savages were
seen advancing in excellent order They were a light green colour the
Savages were and sang with great energy the following strain

  Choo a choo a choo tooth
    Muntch muntch Nycey
  Choo a choo a choo tooth
    Muntch muntch Nyce

As the shades of night were by this time closing in these expressions
were supposed to embody this simple peoples views of the Evening Hymn
But it too soon appeared that the song was a translation of For what
we are going to receive c

The chief imposingly decorated with feathers of lively colours and
having the majestic appearance of a fighting Parrot no sooner
understood he understood English perfectly that the ship was The
Beauty Captain Boldheart than he fell upon his face on the deck and
could not be persuaded to rise until the captain had lifted him up 
told him he wouldnt hurt him All the rest of the savages also fell on
their faces with marks of terror and had also to be lifted up one by
one Thus the fame of the great Boldheart had gone before him even
among these children of Nature

Turtles and oysters were now produced in astonishing numbers and on
these and yams the people made a hearty meal After dinner the Chief
told Captain Boldheart that there was better feeding up at the village
and that he would be glad to take him and his officers there
Apprehensive of treachery Boldheart ordered his boats crew to attend
him completely armed And well were it for other commanders if their
precautionsbut let us not anticipate

Illustration Arminarm with the Chief

Illustration TWO SAVAGES FLOURED HIM BEFORE PUTTING HIM TO THE
FIRE

When the canoes arrived at the beach the darkness of the night was
illumined by the light of an immense fire Ordering his boats crew
with the intrepid though illiterate William at their head to keep
close and be upon their guard Boldheart bravely went on arminarm
with the Chief

But how to depict the captains surprise when he found a ring of Savages
singing in chorus that barbarous translation of For what we are going
to receive c which has been given above and dancing handinhand
round the LatinGrammarMaster in a hamper with his head shaved while
two savages floured him before putting him to the fire to be cooked

Boldheart now took counsel with his officers on the course to be
adopted In the mean time the miserable captive never ceased begging
pardon and imploring to be delivered On the generous Boldhearts
proposal it was at length resolved that he should not be cooked but
should be allowed to remain raw on two conditions Namely

      That he should never under any circumstances presume to teach
     any boy any thing any more

      That if taken back to England he should pass his life in
     travelling to find out boys who wanted their exercises done and
     should do their exercises for those boys for nothing and never say
     a word about it

Drawing his sword from its sheath Boldheart swore him to these
conditions on its shining blade The prisoner wept bitterly and
appeared acutely to feel the errors of his past career

The captain then ordered his boats crew to make ready for a volley and
after firing to reload quickly And expect a score or two on ye to go
head over heels murmured William Boozey for Im a looking at ye
With those words the derisive though deadly William took a good aim

Fire

The ringing voice of Boldheart was lost in the report of the guns and
the screeching of the savages Volley after volley awakened the numerous
echoes Hundreds of savages were killed hundreds wounded and thousands
ran howling into the woods The LatinGrammarMaster had a spare
nightcap lent him and a longtail coat which he wore hind side
before He presented a ludicrous though pitiable appearance and serve
him right

Illustration THE LATINGRAMMARMASTER HAD A SPARE NIGHTCAP LENT HIM
AND A LONGTAIL COAT WHICH HE WORE HIND SIDE BEFORE

Illustration ERE THE SUN WENT DOWN FULL MANY A HORNPIPE HAD BEEN
DANCED  BY THE UNCOUTH THOUGH AGILE WILLIAM

We now find Captain Boldheart with this rescued wretch on board
standing off for other islands At one of these not a cannibal island
but a pork and vegetable one he married only in fun on his part the
Kings daughter Here he rested some time receiving from the natives
great quantities of precious stones gold dust elephants teeth and
sandal wood and getting very rich This too though he almost every
day made presents of enormous value to his men

The ship being at length as full as she could hold of all sorts of
valuable things Boldheart gave orders to weigh the anchor and turn the
Beautys head towards England These orders were obeyed with three
cheers and ere the sun went down full many a hornpipe had been danced
on deck by the uncouth though agile William

We next find Captain Boldheart about three leagues off Madeira
surveying through his spyglass a stranger of suspicious appearance
making sail towards him On his firing a gun ahead of her to bring
her to she ran up a flag which he instantly recognized as the flag
from the mast in the backgarden at home

Illustration Married the Chiefs daughter

Inferring from this that his father had put to sea to seek his
longlost son the captain sent his own boat on board the stranger to
inquire if this was so and if so whether his fathers intentions were
strictly honourable The boat came back with a present of greens and
fresh meat and reported that the stranger was The Family of twelve
hundred tons and had not only the captains father on board but also
his mother with the majority of his aunts and uncles and all his
cousins It was further reported to Boldheart that the whole of these
relations had expressed themselves in a becoming manner and were
anxious to embrace him and thank him for the glorious credit he had done
them Boldheart at once invited them to breakfast next morning on board
the Beauty and gave orders for a brilliant ball that should last all
day

It was in the course of the night that the captain discovered the
hopelessness of reclaiming the LatinGrammarMaster That thankless
traitor was found out as the two ships lay near each other
communicating with The Family by signals and offering to give up
Boldheart He was hanged at the yardarm the first thing in the morning
after having it impressively pointed out to him by Boldheart that this
was what spiters came to

The meeting between the captain and his parents was attended with tears
His uncles and aunts would have attended their meeting with tears too
but he wasnt going to stand that His cousins were very much astonished
by the size of his ship and the discipline of his men and were greatly
overcome by the splendour of his uniform He kindly conducted them round
the vessel and pointed out every thing worthy of notice He also fired
his hundred guns and found it amusing to witness their alarm

The entertainment surpassed everything ever seen on board ship and
lasted from ten in the morning until seven the next morning Only one
disagreeable incident occurred Captain Boldheart found himself obliged
to put his cousin Tom in irons for being disrespectful On the boys
promising amendment however he was humanely released after a few
hours close confinement

Boldheart now took his mother down into the great cabin and asked after
the young lady with whom it was well known to the world he was in
love His mother replied that the object of his affections was then at
school at Margate for the benefit of seabathing it was the month of
September but that she feared the young ladys friends were still
opposed to the union Boldheart at once resolved if necessary to
bombard the town

Taking the command of his ship with this intention and putting all but
fighting men on board The Family with orders to that vessel to keep in
company Boldheart soon anchored in Margate Roads Here he went ashore
wellarmed and attended by his boats crew at their head the faithful
though ferocious William and demanded to see the Mayor who came out
of his office

Dost know the name of yon ship Mayor asked Boldheart fiercely

Illustration DOST KNOW THE NAME OF YON SHIP MAYOR

Illustration STANDING SENTRY OVER HIM

No said the Mayor rubbing his eyes which he could scarce believe
when he saw the goodly vessel riding at anchor

She is named the Beauty said the captain

Hah exclaimed the Mayor with a start And you then are Captain
Boldheart

The same

A pause ensued The Mayor trembled

Now Mayor said the captain choose Help me to my Bride or be
bombarded

The Mayor begged for two hours grace in which to make inquiries
respecting the young lady Boldheart accorded him but one and during
that one placed William Boozey sentry over him with a drawn sword and
instructions to accompany him wherever he went and to run him through
the body if he showed a sign of playing false

At the end of the hour the Mayor reappeared more dead than alive
closely waited on by Boozey more alive than dead

Illustration His lovely Bride came forth

Captain said the Mayor I have ascertained that the young lady is
going to bathe Even now she waits her turn for a machine The tide is
low though rising I in one of our townboats shall not be
suspected When she comes forth in her bathingdress into the shallow
water from behind the hood of the machine my boat shall intercept her
and prevent her return Do you the rest

Mayor returned Capt Boldheart thou hast saved thy town

The captain then signalled his boat to take him off and steering her
himself ordered her crew to row towards the bathingground and there to
rest upon their oars All happened as had been arranged His lovely
bride came forth the Mayor glided in behind her she became confused
and had floated out of her depth when with one skilful touch of the
rudder and one quivering stroke from the boats crew her adoring
Boldheart held her in his strong arms There her shrieks of terror were
changed to cries of joy

Before the Beauty could get under weigh the hoisting of all the flags
in the town and harbour and the ringing of all the bells announced to
the brave Boldheart that he had nothing to fear He therefore determined
to be married on the spot and signalled for a clergyman and clerk who
came off promptly in a sailingboat named the Skylark Another great
entertainment was then given on board the Beauty in the midst of which
the Mayor was called out by a messenger He returned with the news that
Government had sent down to know whether Captain Boldheart in
acknowledgment of the great services he had done his country by being a
Pirate would consent to be made a LieutenantColonel For himself he
would have spurned the worthless boon but his Bride wished it and he
consented

Only one thing further happened before the good ship Family was
dismissed with rich presents to all on board It is painful to record
but such is human nature in some cousins that Captain Boldhearts
unmannerly cousin Tom was actually tied up to receive three dozen with a
ropes end for cheekyness and making games when Captain Boldhearts
lady begged for him and he was spared The Beauty then refitted and the
Captain and his Bride departed for the Indian Ocean to enjoy themselves
for evermore
