A DAY WITH STEVENSON


Supposing that in the month of April  you had arrived a guest
foreseen at the pleasant ivymuffled dwelling in Bournemouth which
had recently adopted the name of Skerryvore and that you had been
permitted to enter its doorsyou might account yourself a somewhat
favoured person  For the master of the house that rickety and
cloistered spectre as he termed himself the pallid brute who lived
in Skerryvore like a weevil in a biscuit might be invisible for the
nonceshut upstairs forbidden even to speak for fear of inducing
hemorrhage  Or again you might yourself be afflicted with an obvious
cold in which case you would not be admitted into his presence lest
you left contagion of that cold

But if fate befriended you you would chance upon the most remarkable
personality it might be that you had yet encountered  A lean long
flatchested man gracefully emphatic of gesturepacing up and down
the room as he talkedburning with hectic energya man of rich brown
tints in hair and eyes and skin mutable mirthful brilliantabove
all vital as he had described himself wholly vital with a buoyance
of life which had upborne him hitherto over the crest of most
tumultuous distresses

Robert Louis Stevenson was now thirtysix years old and ever since his
sixth year when as his mother recorded in her diary he dreamed that
he heard the noise of pens writing his aim had been set unswervingly
toward the one goal  Born of a strong and strenuous family the great
lighthouse builders of the north he was not like them intent upon
the subjugation of obstinate stone the ordering and ordaining of rocks
and seas  Dhu Heartach and the Bell Rock and Skerryvore he could
admire at a distance but the material which cried aloud to him for
mastery was much more plasticyet to him no less stubborn  I
imagine he declared nobody ever had such pains to learn a trade as
I had but I slogged at it day in and day out  His fastidious soul
refused to be contented with a facile and slipshod utterance  A
passionate quest after le mot propre which had led him in his own
phrase to play the sedulus ape to all the great prose writers of the
pastand a sense of style such as no man had ever so anxiously and
assiduously developed in himselfthese had achieved their own reward
Thanks to my dire industry said Stevenson I have done more with
smaller gifts than almost any man of letters in the world

And this was a just pride for there was no branch of literature in
which he could not admirably acquit himself  So many years a struggler
in obscurity with small hopes few successes little
encouragementbattling with continuous and crippling maladiesthis
indomitable artist by sheer dint of dire industry now suddenly
stood forth in full blaze of public recognition  The author of
Virginibus Puerisque Treasure Island Prince Otto The Childs
Garden of Verse and Dr Jekyll was very much a man to be reckoned
with

Probably few modern books have met with such instantaneous and
triumphant success as Treasure Island and Dr Jekyll  The first
after running its course unannounced and comparatively unrecognized
the serial of an obscure author in Young Folks Paper was published
in book formand Stevenson like Byron awoke to find himself
famous  The honours which he had failed to obtain with all the dainty
humour all the valiant fatalism of Virginibus Puerisque had been
accorded without stint to Treasure Island  It was a tense and
stimulating piece of pure adventure  The authentic air of the
eighteenth century breathed through every sentence of it and its fine
flavour of daredevil romance kindled even sober statesmen such as Mr
Gladstone to a very furore of avidity in devouring its breathless
pages

As for Dr Jekyll that gruesome workliterally the product of a
nightmarehad been quoted in pulpits discussed in newspapers read by
everybodyit had taken the world by storm  Yet Stevensons head was
not turned by his tardilywon success with his customary sang froid
he took things as they came failures and triumphs and met each alike
with smiling gallantry

The motives which had led him into authorshipor rather forced him
despite all stress and hindrance of froward circumstanceswere as
curiously varied as his own nature and it was these motives which
still drove him hard and incessantly  To fame he was perhaps not
wholly indifferent  No author sits so austerely aloft as to disdain
popular applause altogether  Yet a born stylist and a conscious
artist like Stevenson knew that his most finished work was above and
beyond the appreciation of the general public  For moneythough it
was a necessity of life to him and although with all his recent
triumphs he was not at present earning more than  a yearfor
money he did not care except as a means to an end  Wealth is only
useful for two things he said a yacht and a string quartet  Except
for these I hold that  a year is as much as a man can possibly
want  Still in declaring I do not write for the public he added
with engaging candour I do write for money a nobler deity and
this to a certain extent was true  It was for money only no doubt
that he was now undertaking against the grain that romance of
tushery The Black Arrow a tale with a medival setting in which he
felt himself ill at ease  But most of all he allowed I write for
myself not perhaps any more noble but both more intelligent and
nearer home

And that a man in such difficulties of health and finance and so
precarious a position should have the courage of his own determined
artistry was in itself sufficiently remarkable but the result more
than justified his choice

All the morning Stevenson had been upstairs writing probably after a
bad night very likely in what any other man would term a totally unfit
condition  Under any and all circumstances he continued to write
unflinchingly racked by coughing reeling with weakness with his
right arm in a sling and his left hand holding the pensitting up in
bed with a clinical thermometer in his mouth and yet as he declared
I like my life all the same  I should bear false witness if I did
not declare life happy  He was in his own words made for a
contest and the powers have so willed that my battlefield should be
this dingy inglorious one of the bed and the physic bottle

To declare life happy became in fact his literary missionthe
condensed philosophy of his gay inveterate courage  I believe that
literature should give joy was his maxim one dank dispirited word
is harmfula crime of lsehumanit  This brave and cheerful
outlook is evident in all his essaysit is so to speak a glorified
and artistic MarkTapleyism allpervading unimpugnable ready to
survive the most malevolent accidents of life the crowning tragedy of
death itself  And so you find the chronic sickist as he termed
himself still ready in all but body for great risks and inspiriting
adventures andthrough a mist of painleading forlorn hopes with a
waving sword of flame  You hear him proclaiming that

All who have meant good work with their whole hearts have done good
work although they may die before they have the time to sign it
Every heart that has beat strong and cheerfully has left a hopeful
impulse behind it in the world and bettered the tradition of mankind
And even if death catch people like an open pitfall and in
midcareer laying out vast projects and planning monstrous
foundations flushed with hope and their mouths full of boastful
language they should be at once tripped up and silenced is there not
something brave and spirited in such a termination and does not life
go down with a better grace foaming in full body over a precipice
than miserable struggling to an end in sandy deltas  Virginibus
Puerisque

And to him above all applied his own triumphant lines those which he
addressed to W E Henley another writer a man of like courageous
outlook who like himself in the fell grip of circumstances had not
winced nor cried aloud

   Small the pipe but oh do thou
  Peakfaced and suffering piper blow therein
  The dirge of heroes dead and to these sick
  These dying sound the triumph over death
  Behold each greatly breathes each tastes a joy
  Unknown before in dying for each knows
  A hero dies with himthough unfulfilled
  Yet conquering trulyand not dies in vain


At present he was engaged upon Kidnapped that admirable piece of
fiction which he had begun partly as a lark and partly as a
potboiler  It was a relief after the concentrated horror of Dr
Jekyll to escape into the Scottish heatherscent and to feel the salt
seawind whistling through the cordage of Kidnapped

Stevenson was desirous to get free of this prisonyard of the
abominably ugly where I take my daily exercise with my
contemporaries  Possibly he recognised that the amazing popularity of
Jekyll had been due to the morbid attractiveness of its subject
rather than to its merits of craftsmanship for as he had averred I
know that good work sometimes hits but with my hand on my heart I
think it is an accident  But now he was at liberty to give play to
his infinite variety upon a true boys booka story to satisfy the
inveterate boyishness of his own heart  Of the romance of boyhood and
adolescence it has been said he is an unsurpassed master  the
philosophy of life developed in both his essays and romances is that
rather of a gifted boy than a mature man  J W Mackail  And even
the girls of Stevensons imagination have been accused of being boys
in petticoats  The phrase has reason  I have never admired a girl
he wrote and again I have never pleased myself with any women of
mine  The other sex remained for him throughout a mystery which he
hardly cared to solvea sealed book which he was not desirous to
open  Of the two eternal factors in the destiny of man warfare and
love although he allowed that to love is the great amulet which
makes the world a garden he preferred to deal almost exclusively with
the warfare

And yet one women had played a very important part in Stevensons life
and it was practically with his marriage that the tide of his fortunes
had changed  His wifetrusty dusky vivid true was his very
alter ego with a character to quote Mr Sidney Colvin as
strong interesting and romantic almost as his own an inseparable
sharer of all his thoughts the most shrewd and stimulating of critics
and in sickness despite her own precarious health the most devoted
and most efficient of nurses  To while away the weary hours of
illness Mrs Stevenson made up stories to amuse himand subsequently
the husband and wife would write them out together  She with her
eyes of gold and brambledew was literally allinall to him as
companion helpmate friendand farhow infinitely farabove the
ideal wife whom he had described so adroitlyin his bachelor
daysthat woman who should have a fine touch for the affections
and who should at least be sufficiently talented to avoid boring her
lifelong comrade  The character of the ideal wife as there
indicatedapt at gracious compromises possessor of a cheerful fluent
tonguewas very obviously set forth by a man who had never yet been
stirred by the sharp throbs of an imperative emotion  And now that
Stevenson realised what love in its depth and breadth might mean it
held a certain sanctity for himhe was loth to speak of it as to
write of it  It was a marvel that had befallen him personally but for
other people it might still perhaps be no more than that gentle
domesticated affection which he had portrayed with such amiable humour
But there was one point in which he consciously or unconsciously
insisted in his desiderata of the female character

It always warms a man he had declared to see a woman brave and
he saw it daily in his wife  Therefore it came about that unversed
in womenas Stevenson unquestionably was he was able to endow his
heroines with a touch of gallant boyishness a hint of the heroicand
if they failed in fleshandbloodvraisemblance they had that
steeltrue bladestraight quality which he adored in the women he
had chosen

You will notice this courageous virtue in all of them rich and poor
from Catriona that tall pretty tender figure of a maiden when
having assured her fathers escape from prison by a bold stratagem she
arrives a fugitive and an exile at Helvoetsluys and lands from the
staggering side of the Rose into the little boat belowwhen in
David Balfours words

I began to think I had made a fools bargain that it was merely
impossible Catriona should be got on board to me and that I stood to
be set ashore in Helvoet all by myself  But this was to reckon
without the lasss courage  Up she stood on the bulwarks and held by
a stay the wind blowing in her petticoats which made the enterprise
more dangerous and gave us rather more a view of her stockings than
would be thought genteel in citiesCatriona

to Seraphina in Prince Otto still inherently valorous in that
desperate flight through the forest where

At length when she was well weary she came upon a wide and shallow
pool  Stones stood in it like islands bulrushes fringed the coast
the floor was paved with pine needles and the pines themselves whose
roots made promontories looked down silently on their green images
She crept to the margin and beheld herself with wonder a hollow and
brighteyed phantom in the ruins of her palace robe  She addressed
herself to make a toilette by that forest mirror washed herself pure
from all the stains of her adventure took off her jewels and wrapped
them in her handkerchief rearranged the tatters of her dress and
took down the folds of her hair  She shook it round her face and the
pool repeated her thus veiled  Prince Otto

Clara Huddlestone in the Pavilion on the Links repeats the same
undauntable note Olalla is inexorable in moral courage of
renunciation even the weeping Blanche in the Sieur de Maltroits
Door has the mettle of some small creature at bay

The charm of Stevensons heroines is in short a cold charm nor does
he often accord them the assistance of a personal description  But
they are finely tempered of the best Toledo steel and owing to their
boyish character there is no very obvious gap in those novels where
they are conspicuously absent such as The Ebb Tide The Wreckers
and The Master of Ballantrae  In the latter indeed there is a
slight female interest but a stronger personality in the heroine
must inevitably have changed or coloured the whole course of the book
and one cannot but detect a certain vacuum where at least some emotion
might have lifted a haggard head in the character of Mrs Henryeven
in that scene surcharged with hidden explosive possibilities when the
author describes how

The Master played upon that little ballad and upon those who heard
him like an instrument and seemed now upon the point of failing and
now to conquer his distress so that the words and music seemed to pour
out of his own heart and his own past and to be aimed directly at Mrs
Henry  When it came to an end we all sat silent for a time he had
chosen the dusk of the afternoon so that none could see his
neighbours face but it seemed as if we held our breathing only my
old lord cleared his throat  The first to move was the singer who got
to his feet suddenly and softly and went and walked softly to and fro
in the low end of the hall  The Master of Ballantrae


But Mrs Henry plays a very minor part in the marring or making here
of two mens lives it is a rle of vis inerti at best  And
indeed when all is said what shall a petticoat be if not irrelevant
among the clash of steel and smoke of pistols in an atmosphere
permeated by Spanish doubloons or illicit piratical treasure
Stevensons infallible artistic instinct led him to keep the
adventurestory pendant upon the deeds of men and the eager mistakes
of boys and a certain curious penchant for the squalid the submerged
the picturesque brought him by choice into such company as no heroine
should enterthat of Villon for instance and John Silver and
Herrick the cockney vagabond  The spice of life is battle he said
and his life and his books were brimful of battles with foes or with
fortune

The openair life which he had perforce abandoned the joy of physical
strength and hairbreadth scape could still be his by proxy  He
revelled in delineating his ideal man

Being a true lover of living a fellow with something pushing and
spontaneous in his inside he must like any other soldier in any
other stirring deadly warfare push on at his best pace until he touch
the goal  A peerage or Westminster Abbey cried Nelson in his
bright boyish heroic manner  These are great incentives not for any
of these but for the plain satisfaction of living of being about
their business in some sort or other do the brave serviceable men of
every nation tread down the nettle danger and pass flyingly over all
the stumblingblocks of prudence  Virginibus Puerisque


The tramp of horsehoofs the clank of the capstan the door ajara
thousand sights and sounds were but symbolisms to him of some
mysterious byway of adventure to be followed up quick with latent
possibilities of romance and from one word one name he could evolve
a whole intricate plot  With the simplest of sentences he could
electrify the startled reader as when in The Wrecker where the
desperate castaways sit gambling on the desert island and one suddenly
cries aloud Sail ho

All turned at the cryand there in the wild light of the morning
heading straight for Midway Reef was the brig Flying Scud of Hull
The Wrecker


On that moment the whole tale hangs as on a pivot  All its involution
and evolution all its intricate and tangled clues leadbackwards or
forwardsto this one swift breathless sight

His mornings work accomplished the tall gaunt man came downstairs
literally to play awhile  After weeks it might be of enforced
seclusion in his room his eye rested pleasurably upon the various
attractive objects which almost seemed like new to him
Stevensonthe avowed evader of personal property the rollingstone
that had so long refused to gather mosswas now under a womans
tender surveillance surrounded with charm and comfort  Our drawing
room he maintained is a place so beautiful that its like eating to
sit down in it  No other room is so lovely in the world  I blush
for the figure I cut in such a bower  The garden Mrs Stevensons
special pleasure but one in which her husband did not share was very
lovely with a lawn and heatherbank and a halfacre of land where a
little stream ran down a chine full of rhododendrons  A large
dovecot figured in the garden and there also Boguey the Stevensons
dog was buried to whom no other dog had ever been deemed a worthy
successor

Stevenson his clothes hanging loosely on his emaciated figure and his
handswonderful handslong and fragile like those in the early
portraits of Velasquez lingered lovingly over the keys  For a while
he amused himself by picking out note by note the oldworld dance
measures of Lully and Rameau those gavottes rigadoons and minuets
which conveyed to him the indefinable potpourrilike flavour of his
favourite eighteenth century embued with a certain stately dignity
the periwig feeling he called it as of lords and ladies treading
courtly measures  Stevenson was passionately fond of classical music
but he had never attained to any facility of execution  And when he
grew tired with his efforts as an interpreter of Lully he turned to
pickling as he called itcomposing that is to say after a
fashion with the manly and melodious forefinger  The fact that he
had invariably failed to master the rudiments of theory in no wise
deterred him on the contrary difficulties rather enhanced his
delight  Books are of no use he avowed they tell you how to write
in four parts and that cannot be done by man  So he continued to
pickle with a light heart and to enjoy consecutive fifths and other
theoretical delinquencies with an enthusiasm worthy of the most modern
composer

Nothing but the lunch hour brought his musical experiments to a close
Stevenson who had in his own words been obliged to strip himself
one after another of all the pleasures that he had chosen except
smoking and indeed he was smoking cigarettes all day long by no
means disdained the pleasures of the table  Not perhaps in the role
of a gourmetbut as an artist in the more recondite delicacies of
taste and smell  To detect the flavour of an olive is no less a piece
of human perfection than to find beauty in the colours of a sunset he
observed he coupled the flavour of wine with the beauty of the dawn
and declared that we do not recognise at its full value the great part
in life that is played by eating and drinking  There is a romance
about the matter after all he observed  Probably the table has more
devotees than love and I am sure food is more generally entertaining
than scenery  It was the romance of the matter that appealed to
him especially the colour and savour and poetical tradition of wine
Books and tobacco jars and some old Burgundy as red as a November
sunset and as fragrant as a violet in Aprilthese he thought
should suffice the most luxurious

After lunch if he anticipated an exhausting evening he went to
sleepat a moments noticeand after a short sound repose was as
eager as ever to resume his pianoforte amusements which he continued
until friends arrived

At the age of fourandtwenty Stevenson had noted down his three chief
wishes  First good health secondly a small competence thirdly O
Du lieber Gott friends  The first wish was irrevocably denied the
second was only just beginning to be granted the guerdon of unresting
toil the third petition had been abundantly answered  Never was a man
more happy in his friends or one who made them so instantaneously and
without effort  He had only to speak said one friend in order to
be recognised in the first minute for a witty and charming gentleman
and in the second for a man of genius  Some indeed like Mr Edmund
Gosse came home dazzled and astounded saying as Constance does of
Arthur Was ever such a gracious creature born  His expression of
mingled tenderness and mirth his scholarly and eclectic
presencetogether with his picturesque velvetcoated appearance and
his flashing flow of words combined to make a man so attractive and so
unique as could command all love at will  And the friends were very
many and very notable who haunted Skerryvore  First and foremost was
Bob Mr R A M Stevenson the poets first cousin the brilliant
art critic the man likest and most unlike to me as RLS described
him  Bobs sister Mrs de Mattos and her child were frequent
visitors then there were celebrities from London such as Sargent the
painter William Archer Sidney Colvin W E Henley Henry James and
again friends residing in the neighbourhood of Bournemouth the poet
Sir Henry Taylor and his family Sir Percy Shelley and his wife
These latter indeed regarded Stevenson almost in the light of a son
He struck them as bearing an extraordinary resemblance to Percy Bysshe
Shelley less perhaps in lineaments than in figure and in mind and
in consequence of this similarity they held him very dear

But to all he was the same bewildering charming host the man who
variously displayed to quote W E Henley

  A deal of Ariel just a streak of Puck
  Much Antony of Hamlet most of all

And combined with these curiously versatile fruits something of the
Shorter Catechist

Generous in criticism kind in praise grave and humorous in rapid
transition the amazing scope and variety of Stevensons writings were
excelled by the scope and variety of his talk  There was no part of
the writer that was not visibly present in the man  Graham Balfour
He had laid down his opinion that there can be no fairer ambition than
to excel in talk to be affable gay ready clear and welcome  But
none save those who were privileged to hear him as with quick
impetuous gestures like a Southern foreigner he emphasised his
phrases could realise the power the versatility the inexpressible
irrepressible charm with which the author could fulfil his fair
ambition

When the visitors had severally taken their departure the strong
resonant voice with its Scottish accent and rich full tones still
ringing in their earsStevenson had suffered no abatement in the
stream of his exuberant mental vitality  The excitement of
conversation had if anything keyed him up and presently for the
writing of a few unavoidable letters he betook himself to his study
the study where a smiling God beholds each day my stage of labour
trod and sate himself down there with reluctance

Correspondence as a rule he found but an irksome affair unless
conducted upon his own whimsical lines  I deny that letters should
contain newsI mean minethose of other people should was his
theory and he boasted himself of a willingness to pour forth
unmitigated rot which constitutes in me the true spirit of
correspondence  For all that his letters grave or gay remain among
the most delightful reading in existence flavoured with his quaintest
conceits endowed with his most delicate turns of phrase and often
tempered with that something of the Shorter Catechist to which Henley
had alluded

For undoubtedly as time went on although Stevenson continued to
combine the face of a boy with the distinguished bearing of a man of
the world he was gradually exchanging the streak of Puck and the
capricious unconventions of the born Bohemian for something graver and
more maturea tendency almost towards the didactic  Tis a strange
world indeed he had commented but there is a manifest God for those
who care to look for Him  And now with the passing of years he
observed there grows more and more upon me that belief in the
kindness of this scheme of things and the goodness of our veiled God
which is an excellent and pacifying compensation  He was suffering
and in all probability would perpetually suffer from that sharp
ferule of calamity under which we are all Gods scholars till we die
but his patience was impregnable and his desire to leave a brave
example bore him constant company  To suffer said he sets a keen
edge on what remains of the agreeable and he prepared to enjoy with
equal zest all pleasures which were still permitted to him

As he put away his writing materials and descended once more to his
beloved piano his father and mother came in  They were living in
Bournemouth to be near their only son  The old lighthouse engineer
whose father had built the Bell Rock who had served under his brother
Alan in the building of Skerryvore the noblest of all extant
sealights who had himself erected Dhu Heartach was now palpably
failing  The spectacle of a stern and honest man slowly evacuating all
that he had held of personal strength was to his son Louis a
poignantly pathetic one  Their disagreements had been very many and
deeprooted dating from even before that dreadful evening walk in
Stevensons youth when on being tightly crossquestioned the lad
who had been trained for a civil engineer and had worked in a
carpenters shop and had a brass foundry and hung about woodyards and
the like confessed that he cared for nothing but literatureno
profession as his father contemptuously replied  They had differed
on almost every conceivable topic open to their discussionyet here
in the fulness of time they were at peace togetherthe austere old
man in his second childhood and the chronic invalid who must live as
though he were walking on eggs  Innumerable ineffaceable traits of
similarity bound one to the other at bottom of all the bygone angers
lay a permanent bedrock of mutual love  And perhaps the nearing vision
of death which terminated all vistas for both of them exercised its
usual effect of calm and laisserfaire and the equalisation of
things for it is probable that no man has a just sense of
proportionate values until he stands in the presence of death

Stevenson had often alluded as a matter of personal knowledge to his
constant prescience of mortality and how it affected a mans thoughts
of life  Very seldom has the view of the confirmed invalid the doomed
consumptive been put forth to the world with the frankness with which
Stevenson invested it  He has been sometimes charged with a certain
lack of reticence but in this matter unquestionably his candour was
to the benefitting of mankind to whom these close views of the
inevitable end are rarely possible under such deliberate and
clearheaded conditions

There is nothing maudlin nothing hypochondriacal about Stevensons
treatment of this subject the same cheerful philosophy bears him up
the same vitality of joy  It is hardly to be wondered at that some
critics handled him seriously on account of his lightheartedness in
the august shadow of the last enemyand his inveterate optimism in
the face of all calamities  He jests at scars who never felt a
wound they practically told himand could hardly be persuaded to
credit the paradox that the man who preached in season and out of
season the gospel of that cheery old Pagan Hope was not a denizen
of the openairhealthy athletic vigorous incapable of realising
the maladies incident to maninstead of an emaciated bedridden
creature whose smallest pleasures must be measured so to speak in a
medicineglass  But It is something after all he has said to
leave a brave example and in that he triumphantly succeeded  For the
opportunities of meteoric heroisms are few and far between but every
hour beholds the need of those obscurer braveries which may be born of
pain and suffering

In Ordered South and other wellknown essays he shows the gradual
relaxation of the ties which bind a man to terrestrial thingsand the
curiously significant alteration in his regard for the facts of
lifefrom the sower in the dank spring furrows to the sight of
little children with their long possibilities before them

Stevenson had no children of his own  His stepson Lloyd Osbourne
then at school in Bournemouth was destined to become his friend and
collaborator but it is doubtful that he cared for children as such
The average small folk dragged about in a pleasing stupor by nurses
were very far remote from that superabundant vitality nursed in an
attenuated physique which had sat up with a shawl over its shoulders
so many tedious months in childhood when its principal habitat was
The Land of Counterpane and other regions mapped out in the great and
glorious world of MakeBelieve

For this reason the Childs Garden of Verses is not in any real
sense of the word a childs book at all  It contains the exquisite
imaginations of childhood as the grownup man remembers them to him
they have the charm of the vanished past they are the utterances of
one who has also lived in Arcadia  But to the child they are the very
commonplaces of existence  To sway to and fro in a swing the
pleasantest thing a child can doto bring home treasures from field
and wood nuts and wooden whistles and some allprecious
unidentifiable stone though father denies it Im sure it is
goldthese are everyday affairs to the countrychildjust as
watching the lamplighter is to the town child  To read verses about
them is but a waste of time when one might be actively engaged in
similar avocations  But to the grownman who can never play with
wooden soldiers in the garden never be a pirate any morethese
reminiscences of Stevensons are a delight unfailing  No one else has
ever worded them quite so accurately quite so simply and taken all
for all they are in themselves a summingup of that most excellent
philosophy of this author The world is so full of a number of things
Im sure we should all be as happy as kings  The world was indeed
full of a number of things to RLS andpassed through the crucible
of his own astonishing personalitythey were all bad or good
transmogrified into things that make for joy

After eight oclock dinner was over the old folks bade
goodnightthe father with touching affection kissing Louis as
though he were a child and murmuring Youll see me in the morning
dearie as if still addressing that little feeble creature who had
been kept alive with such difficulty in the old days at Edinburgh

The younger man returned to the pianoforte it drew him like a magnet
For a short time he indulged in his desultory musicmaking relishing
to the uttermost every success of sound which he achieved and the
happiness which was his theory of life radiated in warm abundance
from his richlytinted face and glowing eyes  Its a fine life he
exclaimed

At last the days supply of energy succumbed before the imperious
demands of this fiery threadpaper of a man and in deference to his
wifes suggestion he betook himself to bed  Not necessarily to rest
for even in his dreams his busy brain was working and his Brownies
as he termed them bringing him fresh material for plots  Dr Jekyll
had been thus evolved from three scenes dreamed successively in detail
from which the dreamer waked with cries of horror

But he did not flinch before the coming night and anything that it
might bring of sickness or unrest  He thought alone upon the past
delightful day fraught with strenuous work and simple pleasures and
he petitioned in his own words

  If I have faltered more or less
  In my great task of happiness
  If I have moved along my race
  And shown no glorious morning face
  If beams from happy human eyes
  Have moved me not if morning skies
  Books and my food and summer rain
  Knocked on my sullen heart in vain
  Lord Thy most pointed pleasure take
  And stab my spirit broad awake
                          Underwoods


His wife hovered around him with gentle ministrations as suddenly
outwearied Robert Louis Stevenson extended his long lean form to a
possible repose  There was not perhaps a cheerfuller man that night
in England

The sea hummed at the foot of the chine with that soft and dovelike
purring of the Southcoast sea the doves made answer with a vibrant
cooing in the middle distance of the twilight garden  Spring buds of
peartrees and cherrytrees globed themselves stealthily into blossom
a delicate latent energy was consciously present in the airthe rising
of sap and revivification of seed all the mysterious hidden progresses
of April  And the man whose ways were set in a perpetual convergence
towards the doors of death waved so to speak a blithe recognition to
the myriad hosts of life

O toiling hands of mortals  O unwearied feet travelling ye know not
whither  Soon soon it seems to you you must come forth on some
conspicuous hilltop and but a little way further against the setting
sun descry the spires of El Dorado  Little do ye know your own
blessedness for to travel hopefully is a better thing than to arrive
and the true success is labour  Virginibus Puerisque



The author desires to acknowledge the kindness of Messrs Cassell 
Co in allowing short extracts to be made from The Master of
Ballantrae The Wrecker and Catriona also to thank Mr William
Heinemann for a similar courtesy with regard to St Ives and Messrs
Chatto  Windus for their permission to include various quotations from
Virginibus Puerisque Underwoods and Prince Otto
