PREFACE


This collection of oneact plays appears because of an increasingly
large demand for such a volume The plays have been selected and the
Introduction prepared to meet the need of the student or teacher who
desires to acquaint himself with the oneact play as a specific dramatic
form

The plays included have been selected with this need in mind
Accordingly emphasis has been placed upon the wholesome and uplifting
rather than upon the sordid and the ultrarealistic The unduly
sentimental the strikingly melodramatic and the play of questionable
moral problems has been consciously avoided Comedies tragedies
farces and melodramas have been included but the chief concern has
been that each play should be good dramatic art

The Dramatic Analysis and Construction of the OneAct Play which
appears in the Introduction also has been prepared for the student or
teacher This outlineanalysis and the plays in this volume are
sufficient material if carefully studied for an understanding and
appreciation of the oneact play

CONTEMPORARY ONEACT PLAYS




INTRODUCTION

THE ONEACT PLAY AS A SPECIFIC DRAMATIC TYPE


The oneact play is with us and is asking for consideration It is
challenging our attention whether we will or no In both Europe and
America it is one of the conspicuous factors in presentday dramatic
activity Theatre managers stage designers actors playwrights and
professors in universities recognize its presence as a vital force
Professional theatre folk and amateurs especially are devoting zestful
energy both to the writing and to the producing of this shorter form of
drama

The oneact play is claiming recognition as a specific dramatic type It
may be said that as an art form it has achieved that distinction The
short story as every one knows was once an embryo and an experiment
but few nowadays would care to hold that it has not developed into a
specific and worthy literary form This shorter form of prose fiction
was once apologetic and that not so many years ago but it has come
into its own and now is recognized as a distinct type of prose
narrative The oneact play like the short story also has come into
its own No longer is it wholly an experiment Indeed it is succeeding
in high places The oneact play is taking its place among the
significant types of dramatic and literary expression

Artistically and technically considered the oneact play is quite as
much a distinctive dramatic problem as the longer play In writing
either the playwright aims so to handle his material that he will get
his central intent to his audience and will provoke their interest and
emotional response thereto Both aim at a singleness of impression and
dramatic effect both aim to be a high order of art Yet since the one
is shorter and more condensed it follows that the dramaturgy of the one
is somewhat different from that of the other just as the technic of the
cameo is different from the technic of the fullsized statue The
oneact play must as it were be presented at a single setting it
must start quickly at the beginning with certain definite dramatic
elements and pass rapidly and effectively to a crucial movement without
halt or digression A careful analysis of any one of the plays in this
volume like Anton Tchekovs The Boor or like Oscar M Wolffs Where
But in America will reveal this fact The shorter form of drama like
the short story has a technical method characteristically its own

It is a truth that the oneact play is well made or it is nothing at
all A careful analysis of Sir James M Barries The TwelvePound
Look Paul Hervieus Modesty Althea Thurstons The Exchange will
reveal that these representative oneact plays are well made and are
real bits of dramatic art A good oneact play is not a mere cheap
mechanical tour de force mechanics and artistry it has of course
but it is also a high order of art product A delicately finished cameo
is quite as much a work of art as is the larger statue both have
mechanics and design in their structure but those of the cameo are more
deft and more highly specialized than those of the statue because the
work of the former is done under far more restricted conditions The
oneact play at its best is cunningly wrought

Naturally the material of the oneact play is a bit episodical It
deals with but a single situation A study of the plays in this volume
will reveal that no whole lifes story can be treated adequately in the
short play and that no complexity of plot can be employed Unlike the
longer play the shorter form of drama shows not the whole manexcept
by passing hintbut a significant moment or experience a significant
charactertrait However vividly this chosen moment may be
interpretedand the oneact play must be vividmuch will still be
left to the imagination It is the aim of the oneact form to trace the
causal relations of but one circumstance so that the circumstance may
be intensified The writer of the oneact play deliberately isolates so
that he may throw the strong flashlight more searchingly on some one
significant event on some fundamental element of character on some
moving emotion He presents in a vigorous compressed and suggestive
way a simplification and idealization of a particular part or aspect of
life Often he opens but a momentary little vista of life but it is so
clearcut and so significant that a whole life is often revealed
thereby

The student must not think that because the oneact play deals with but
one crisis or but one simplified situation it is therefore weak and
inconsequential On the contrary since only one event or situation can
be emphasized it follows that the writer is obliged to choose the one
determining crisis which makes or mars the supreme struggle of a soul
the one great change or turningpoint or end of a life history Often
such moments are the really vital material for drama nothing affords so
much opportunity for striking analysis for emotional stress for the
suggestion of a whole character sketched in the act of meeting its test

The oneact play is a vital literary product To segregate a bit of
significant experience and to present a finished picture of its aspects
and effects to dissect a motive so searchingly and skilfully that its
very roots are laid bare to detach a single figure from a dramatic
sequence and portray the essence of its character to bring a series of
actions into the clear light of day in a sudden and brief human crisis
to tell a significant story briefly and with suggestion to portray the
humor of a person or an incident or in a trice to reveal the touch of
tragedy resting like the finger of fate on an experience or on a
characterthese are some of the possibilities of the oneact play when
bandied by a master dramatist


THE PROPER APPROACH TO THE STUDY OF THE ONEACT PLAY

To read a oneact play merely to get its story is not in itself an
exercise of any extraordinary value This sort of approach to any form
of literature does not require much appreciation of literary art nor
much intelligence Almost any normalminded person can read a play for
its story with but little expenditure of mental effort Proper
appreciation of a oneact play requires more than a casual reading whose
chief aim is no more than getting the plot

If the shorter form of drama is to be appreciated properly as a real
literary form it must be approached from the point of view of its
artistry and technic This means that the student should understand its
organic construction and technic just as he should understand the
organic construction and technic of a short story a ballad or a
perfect sonnet if he is to appreciate them properly

The student should know what the dramatist intends to get across the
footlights to his audience and should be able to detect how he
accomplishes the desired result

It must not be thought that the author urges a study of construction at
the expense of the human values in a play On the contrary such a study
is but the means whereby the human values are made the more manifest
Surely no one would argue that the less one knows about the technic of
music the better able is one to appreciate music Indeed it is not too
much to say that within reasonable limits no one can really appreciate
a oneact play if one does not know at least the fundamentals of its
dramatic organization

In fact students of the oneact play recognize in its constructive
regularity not a hindrance to its beauty but a genuine power This but
lends to it the charm of perfection The sonnet and the cameo are
admirable if for no other reason than their superior workmanship The
oneact play does not lose by any reason of its technical requirements
indeed this is one of its greatest assets And the student who will
take the pains to familiarize himself with the organic construction of a
typical oneact play will have gone a long way in arriving at a proper
appreciation of this shorter form of drama


DRAMATIC ANALYSIS AND CONSTRUCTION OF THE ONEACT PLAY

I THE THEME OF THE ONEACT PLAY

The oneact play like the short story is a work of literary art and
must be approached as such Just like a painting or a poem or a fine
public building the oneact play aims at making a singleness of
effect upon the reader or observer One does not judge a statue or a
poem or any other work of art by the appearance of any isolated part
of it but by the sumtotal effect of the whole The fundamental aim of
a oneact play is that it shall so present a singleness of effect to the
reader or to the assembled group who have gathered to witness a
performance of it that the reader or observer will be provoked to
emotional response thereto

Thus when a student reads a play like George Middletons Tradition
he is made to see and feel that the life of a daughter has been
handicapped and the longings of a mother smothered because of the
conventional narrowness of an otherwise loving father This is the
singleness of effect of the play this is its theme This is precisely
what the author of the play wished his reader or observer to see and
feel When one reads Bosworth Crockers The Last Straw one feels that
a reasonably good and worthy man because of his sensitiveness to
criticism has been driven to despair and to a tragic end by the
malicious gossip of neighbors Ones sense of pity at his misfortune is
aroused This is what the author intended to do This idea and effect is
the theme of the play And when the student reads Paul Hervieus
Modesty he feels that a woman even though she may lead herself into
thinking she prefers brutal frankness instinctively likes affection and
even flattery This is the effect produced by the play this is its
intent this is its theme

In approaching a oneact play then the very first consideration should
be to determine what the purpose and intent of the play isto determine
its theme This demands that the play be read through complete at one
sitting and that no premature conclusions be drawn Once the play is
read it is well to subject the play to certain leading questions What
has the author intended that his reader or hearer shall understand
think or feel What is the play about What is its object and purpose
Is it a precept or an observation found in life or is it a bit of
fancy Is it artificially didactic and moralizing With what fundamental
element in human nature does it have to do Love Patriotism Fear
Egotism and selfcentredness Sacrifice Faithfulness Or what

A word of warning should be given The student should not get the idea
that by theme is meant the moral of the play A good play may be
thoroughly moral without its descending to commonplace moralizing Good
plays concern themselves with the presentation of the fundamentals of
life rather than a creed of morals theories and propagandas Art
concerns itself with larger things than didactic and argumentative
moralizing


II THE TECHNIC OF THE ONEACT PLAY

Once the student satisfies himself as to the singleness of effect or
theme of the play he will do well to set himself to the task of seeing
just how the dramatist has achieved this effect He should keep in mind
that the playwright is a skilled workman that he has predetermined for
himself just what he wishes his audience to think feel or understand
and has marshalled all his materials to that end The way by which he
accomplishes that end is his technic Technic is but the practical
method by which an artist can most effectively convey his message to
his public In a play the materials that the dramatist uses to this end
are character plot dialogue and stage direction If he is skilled he
will use these elements in such a way that the result will be an
artistic whole a singleness of effect an organized unit that will
exemplify and express his theme

A THE CHARACTERS IN THE ONEACT PLAYGenerally speaking drama
grows out of character Farce melodrama and extravaganza usually
consist of situation rather than of character In any event the student
should avail himself of every means to understand the characters in the
play under discussion His real appreciation of the play will be in
direct ratio almost to his understanding of the persons in the drama
Any attention given to this end will be energy well spent The student
should get into the very heart of the characters as it were

Thus ADONIJAH in Beulah Bornsteads The Diabolical Circle is a
narrow selfcentred Puritan egotist who has little about his
personality to appeal to the romantic and vivacious BETTY LADY SIMS in
Sir James M Barries The TwelvePound Look is a woman who really is
pathetic in her longing for some human independence in the presence of
her selfcentred husband SIR HARRY SIMS And MANIKIN and MINIKIN in
Alfred Kreymborgs Manikin and Minikin are conventionalized puppets
representing the light yet halfserious bickerings jealousies and
quarrellings of human nature

The student will do well to characterize the dramatis person
deliberately and specifically He should not now value himself for
working fast for things done in a hurry usually lack depth He must not
be content with vague and thin generalities In analyzing a character it
might be well to apply some specific questions similar to the following
Just what is the elemental human quality in the character Loving
Trusting Egotistic Superstitious Revengeful Treacherous Selfish
Discontented Optimistic Romantic Or what How does the dramatist
characterize them By action By dialogue By spirit of likes and
dislikes By racial trait By religion By peculiarity of manner
speech appearance Are the characters really dramatic are they
impelled to strong emotional reaction upon each other and upon
situation Do they provoke ones dramatic sympathy Do they make one
feel their own point of view and their own motives for conduct

B THE PLOT OF THE ONEACT PLAYPlot and character are integrally
interlinked Plot is not merely story taken from everyday life where
seldom do events occur in a series of closely following minor crucial
moments leading to a climax The dramatist so constructs his material
that there is a sequential and causal interplay of dramatic forces
ending in some major crisis or crucial moment Plot may be said to be
the framework and constructed story by which a dramatist exemplifies his
theme It does not exist for its own end but is one of the fundamental
means whereby the playwright gets his singleness of effect or theme to
his reader or hearer From the story material at his disposal the
playwright constructs his plot to this very end

Careful attention should be given to the plot The student should
question it carefully Do the plot materials seem to have been taken
from actual life Or do they seem to be invented Is the plot well
suited to exemplifying the theme Reconstruct the story out of which the
plot may have been built Since the plot of a oneact play is highly
simplified determine whether there are any complexities any
irrelevancies any digressions Does the plot have a welldefined
beginning middle and end

 The Beginning of the OneAct PlayHaving but a relatively short
time at its disposal usually about thirty minutes and seldom more than
fortyfive minutes the beginning of a oneact play is very short It is
characterized by condensation compactness and brevity Seldom is the
beginning more than a halfpage in length often the play is got under
way in two or three speeches The student will do well to practise to
the end that he will recognize instantly when the dramatic background of
a oneact play has been laid

Whatever else may characterize the beginning it must be dramatically
effective Instantly it must catch the powers of perception by making
them aware of the initial situation out of which the subsequent dramatic
action will develop A good beginning makes one feel that suddenly he
has come face to face with a situation which cannot be solved without an
interplay of dramatic forces to a given final result

Thus when one reads Althea Thurstons The Exchange one is made
suddenly to feel that human beings are discontent with their
shortcomings and possessed qualities and that they always feel that
they would be happier if they possessed something other than what they
have The JUDGE who handles the cases as they come in for exchange is
disgusted with the vanities of humankind and is ready to clear his
hands of the whole matter Here is a situation it is the beginning of
the play In the beginning of Lady Gregorys Hyacinth Halvey one is
brought suddenly to the realization that HYACINTH HALVEY instinctively
rebels against the highly colored and artificially created good name
that has been unwittingly superimposed upon him This situation
suddenly presented is the beginning of the play Out of this initial
situation the subsequent dramatic action evolves

Is the beginning too short Too long Does it make the initial dramatic
situation clear How has the playwright made it clear and effective
Just where is the end of the beginning Although the beginning and the
subsequent plot development are well blended together so that there is
no halting where the beginning ends usually one can detect where the
one ends and the other begins It is a good idea for the purpose of
developing a sense of the organic structure of the oneact play to draw
a line across the page of the play just where the one ends and the
other begins

The setting of the play is a part of the beginning Is the setting
realistic Romantic Fantastic or bizarre Are the details of stage
design properties and especially the atmosphere and color scheme in
harmony with the tone of the play itself Is the setting really an
organic part of the play or is it something apart from it Note that the
setting is usually written in the third person present tense and in
italics

 The Middle of the OneAct PlayThe middle of a oneact play is
concerned primarily with the main crucial moment or climax and the
dramatic movement that from the beginning leads up to it A good play
consists of a series of minor crises leading up to a major crisis or
crucial moment It is for this crucial moment that the play exists it
is for this big scene precisely that the play has been written Indeed
the play succeeds or fails as the crucial moment is strongly dramatic or
flabbily weak This is the part of the play that is strongest in
dramatic tension strongest in emotional functioning

A study of Sir James M Barries The TwelvePound Look shows that the
crucial moment comes at the point where SIR HARRY SIMS in his
selfcentred egotism discovers that his wifes LADY SIMSS
heartlonging could easily be satisfied if she were permitted no other
freedom than merely operating a typewriter In Althea Thurstons The
Exchange the crucial moment comes when the several characters who
unwittingly had exchanged one ill for a worse one find that they can
never reexchange and that they must endure the torments and
displeasure of the newly acquired ill throughout life

Just where is the crucial moment or climax in the play under
consideration Determine the several minor crises that lead up to the
crucial moment Is the crucial moment delayed too long for good dramatic
effect Or is it reached too soon so that the play is too short and too
sudden in reaching the climax Does it make one feel that some vital
result has been attained in the plot movement Is it characterized by
strong situation and by strong emotional reactions of character on
character or of character on situation

For purposes of impressing a sense the organic structure of a oneact
play it is a good plan to draw a horizontal line across the page at the
close of the crucial moment Keep in mind however that the crucial
moment is not the end of the play as it appears on the printed page or
as it is acted on the stage

 The End of the OneAct PlayThe end of the oneact play is an
important consideration Too often it is entirely lost sight of It is
the part that frequently makes or mars a play When the crucial moment
or climax has been reached the plot action of the play is completed
but the play is not yet completed The play needs yet to be rounded out
into an artistic and dramatic whole In life the actual crisis in human
affairs is not often our chiefest interest but the reaction of
characters immediately after the crisis has occurred Thus in a play
the emotional reaction of the characters on the crucial moment and the
more or less sudden readjustment between characters after the crucial
moment must be presented For this very purpose the end of the oneact
play is constructed The end is of need very shortusually even shorter
than the beginning Usually the end consists of but a speech or two or
sometimes only of pantomime that more effectively expresses the
emotional reactions of the characters on the crucial moment than
dialogue

Thus in Sir James M Barries The TwelvePound Look the end consists
of but pantomime in which SIR HARRY expresses his emotional reaction
upon his wifes longing for the human liberty that even the operating of
a typewriter would provide her The end of Bosworth Crockers The Last
Straw comes immediately after the pistolshot is heard in the adjoining
room and MRS BAUERS voice is heard Fritz Fritz Speak to me Look
at me Fritz You didnt do it Fritz I know you didnt do it etc

Is the end of the play under consideration in terms of dialogue In
pantomime Or both Is it too long Too short Is it dramatic Is it
conclusive and satisfying

C DIALOGUE OF THE ONEACT PLAYDialogue like plot and
characterization is another means whereby the theme of the play is got
to the reader or audience Good dramatic dialogue is constructed to this
very end It is not the commonplace rambling uncertain and realistic
question and answer of everyday life Usually good dramatic dialogue is
crisp direct condensed It is the substance but not the form of
ordinary conversation Its chiefest characteristic is spontaneity

The highest type of dramatic dialogue is that which expresses the ideas
and emotions of characters at the points of highest emotional
functioning It will readily be seen then that not all dialogue in a
play is necessarily dramatic In truth the best dramatic dialogue
occurs in conjunction with the series of minor crises and the crucial
moment that go to make up the dramatic movement of the play Often there
is much dialogue in a play that essentially is not dramatic at all

In analyzing dramatic dialogue it is well to inquire whether in the play
it serves  to express the ideas and emotions of characters at points
of highest emotional functioning  to advance the plot  to reveal
character or  what Is it brief clear direct spontaneous Or is
it careless loose insipid Wit repartee Didactic moralizing
Satirical cynical

D STAGEBUSINESS AND STAGEDIRECTION IN THE ONEACT PLAYThe
stagebusiness and stagedirection usually printed in italics of a
play are an essential part of a drama They must not be ignored in
either reading or staging a play The novel or short story generally
uses narration and description to achieve its desired result a play on
the contrary uses dialogue and concrete objective pantomime that may be
seen readily with the eye A play is not a story narrated in
chronological order of events but it is a story so handled and so
constructed that it can be acted on a stage by actors before an
audience It is a series of minor crises leading to a major crisis
presented to a reader or to an audience by characters dialogue and
stagebusiness and pantomime For purposes of indicating the pantomimic
action of the play the dramatist resorts to stagebusiness and
stagedirection

Does the stagedirection aid in making  the dialogue  the plot
 the dramatic action or  the character more clear Does it
shorten the play Does it express idea emotion or situations more
effectively than could dialogue if it were used

And finally do not judge any play until all the evidence is in until
you have thoroughly mastered every detail and have fully conceived the
authors idea and purpose It is not a question whether you would
have selected such a theme or whether you would have handled it in the
same way in which the author did but the point is does the author in
his way make his theme clear to you The author has conceived a
dramatic problem in his own mind and has set it forth in his own
way The question is does he make you see his result and his method

Do you like the play Or do you not like it State your reason in either
case Is it because of the author Is it because of the theme Is it
because of the technicthe way he gets his intent to his reader or
audience Is it because of your own likes or dislikes preconceived
notions or prejudices Is it because of the acting Of the staging or
setting Does it uplift or depress Does it provoke you to emotional
functioning

    Though old the thought and oft expressed
    Tis his at last who says it best

BY

SIR JAMES M BARRIE


The TwelvePound Look is reprinted by permission of Charles Scribners
Sons the publisher in America of the works of Sir James M Barrie For
permission to perform address the publisher


SIR JAMES M BARRIE

Sir James M Barrie is rated as the foremost English dramatist of the
day and his plays taken together make the most significant
contribution to English drama since Sheridan Practically his entire
life has been given to the writing of novels and plays many of the
latter having their heroines conceived especially for Maude Adams one
of Americas greatest actresses He was born in Kirriemuir Scotland in
 He received his education at Dumfries and Edinburgh University
His first work in journalism and letters was done at Nottingham but
soon he took up his work in London where he now resides

Sir James M Barries literary labors have been very fruitful His The
Professors Love Story The Little Minister Quality Street The
Admirable Crichton Peter Pan What Every Woman Knows and Alice
SitbytheFire are well known to every one

In  there appeared a volume of oneact plays Half Hours the most
important of which is The TwelvePound Look And in  appeared a
volume Echoes of the War the most important oneact play therein
being The Old Lady Shows Her Medals

Barrie is a great playwright because he is so thoroughly human All the
little whimsicalities sentiments little loves and heartlongings of
human beings are ever present in his plays He is no reformer no
propagandist He appeals to the emotions rather than to the intellect
He continues the romantic tradition in English drama and gives us plays
that are wholesome tender and human And with all this he has the
added saving grace of a most absorbing humor

While Barrie is not a devotee of the wellmade play his The
TwelvePound Look is one of the most nearly perfect oneact plays of
contemporary drama His interest in human personalities is not more
manifest in any of his plays than in LADY SIMS and SIR HARRY SIMS in
this play

THE TWELVEPOUND LOOKA


     If quite convenient as they say about checks you are to conceive
     that the scene is laid in your own house and that HARRY SIMS is
     you Perhaps the ornamentation of the house is a trifle
     ostentatious but if you cavil at that we are willing to
     redecorate you dont get out of being HARRY SIMS on a mere
     matter of plush and dados It pleases us to make him a city man
     but rather than lose you he can be turned with a scrape of the
     pen into a KC fashionable doctor Secretary of State or what
     you will We conceive him of a pleasant rotundity with a thick red
     neck but we shall waive that point if you know him to be thin

     It is that day in your career when everything went wrong just when
     everything seemed to be superlatively right

     In HARRYS case it was a woman who did the mischief She came to
     him in his great hour and told him she did not admire him Of
     course he turned her out of the house and was soon himself again
     but it spoiled the morning for him This is the subject of the
     play and quite enough too

     HARRY is to receive the honor of knighthood in a few days and we
     discover him in the sumptuous snuggery of his home in Kensington
     or is it Westminster rehearsing the ceremony with his wife
     They have been at it all the morning a pleasing occupation MRS
     SIMS as we may call her for the last time as it were and
     strictly as a goodnatured joke is wearing her presentation gown
     and personates the august one who is about to dub her HARRY
     knight She is seated regally Her jewelled shoulders proclaim
     aloud her husbands generosity She must be an extraordinarily
     proud and happy woman yet she has a drawn face and shrinking ways
     as if there were some one near her of whom she is afraid She claps
     her hands as the signal to HARRY He enters bowing and with a
     graceful swerve of the leg He is only partly in costume the sword
     and the real stockings not having arrived yet With a gliding
     motion that is only delayed while one leg makes up on the other he
     reaches his wife and going on one knee raises her hand superbly
     to his lips She taps him on the shoulder with a paperknife and
     says huskily Rise Sir Harry He rises bows and glides about
     the room going on his knees to various articles of furniture and
     rises from each a knight It is a radiant domestic scene and
     HARRY is as dignified as if he knew that royalty was rehearsing it
     at the other end

SIR HARRY Complacently Did that seem all right eh

LADY SIMS Much relieved I think perfect

SIR HARRY But was it dignified

LADY SIMS Oh very And it will be still more so when you have the
sword

SIR HARRY The sword will lend it an air There are really the five
momentssuiting the action to the wordthe glidethe dipthe
kissthe tapand you back out a knight Its short but its a very
beautiful ceremony Kindly Anything you can suggest

LADY SIMS Nooh no Nervously seeing him pause to kiss the tassel
of a cushion You dont think you have practised till you know what to
do almost too well

     He has been in a blissful temper but such niggling criticism
     would try any man

SIR HARRY I do not Dont talk nonsense Wait till your opinion is
asked for

LADY SIMS Abashed Im sorry Harry A perfect butler appears and
presents a card The Flora Typewriting Agency

SIR HARRY Ah yes I telephoned them to send some one A woman I
suppose Tombes

TOMBES Yes Sir Harry

SIR HARRY Show her in here He has very lately become a stickler for
etiquette And Tombes strictly speaking you know I am not Sir
Harry till Thursday

TOMBES Beg pardon sir but it is such a satisfaction to us

SIR HARRY Goodnaturedly Ah they like it downstairs do they

TOMBES Unbending Especially the females Sir Harry

SIR HARRY Exactly You can show her in Tombes The butler departs on
his mighty task You can tell the woman what she is wanted for Emmy
while I change He is too modest to boast about himself and prefers
to keep a wife in the house for that purpose You can tell her the
sort of things about me that will come better from you Smiling
happily You heard what Tombes said Especially the females And he
is right Success The women like it even better than the men And
rightly For they share You share Lady Sims Not a woman will see
that gown without being sick with envy of it I know them Have all our
lady friends in to see it It will make them ill for a week

     These sentiments carry him off lightheartedly and presently the
     disturbing element is shown in She is a mere typist dressed in
     uncommonly good taste but at contemptibly small expense and she
     is carrying her typewriter in a friendly way rather than as a badge
     of slavery as of course it is Her eye is clear and in odd
     contrast to LADY SIMS she is selfreliant and serene

KATE Respectfully but she should have waited to be spoken to Good
morning madam

LADY SIMS In her nervous way and scarcely noticing that the typist
is a little too ready with her tongue Good morning As a first
impression she rather likes the woman and the woman though it is
scarcely worth mentioning rather likes her LADY SIMS has a maid for
buttoning and unbuttoning her and probably another for waiting on the
maid and she gazes with a little envy perhaps at a woman who does
things for herself Is that the typewriting machine

KATE Who is getting it ready for use Yes Not Yes madam as it
ought to be I suppose if I am to work here I may take this off I get
on better without it She is referring to her hat

LADY SIMS Certainly But the hat is already off I ought to
apologize for my gown I am to be presented this week and I was trying
it on

     Her tone is not really apologetic She is rather clinging to the
     glory of her gown wistfully as if not absolutely certain you
     know that it is a glory

KATE It is beautiful if I may presume to say so

     She frankly admires it She probably has a best and a second best
     of her own that sort of thing

LADY SIMS With a flush of pride in the gown Yes it is very
beautiful The beauty of it gives her courage Sit down please

KATE The sort of woman who would have sat down in any case I
suppose it is some copying you want done I got no particulars I was
told to come to this address but that was all

LADY SIMS Almost with the humility of a servant Oh it is not work
for me it is for my husband and what he needs is not exactly copying
Swelling for she is proud of HARRY He wants a number of letters
answeredhundreds of themletters and telegrams of congratulation

KATE As if it were all in the days work Yes

LADY SIMS Remembering that HARRY expects every wife to do her
duty My husband is a remarkable man He is about to be knighted
Pause but KATE does not fall to the floor He is to be knighted
for his services toon reflectionfor his services She is
conscious that she is not doing HARRY justice He can explain it so
much better than I can

KATE In her businesslike way And I am to answer the
congratulations

LADY SIMS Afraid that it will be a hard task Yes

KATE Blithely It is work I have had some experience of She
proceeds to type

LADY SIMS But you cant begin till you know what he wants to say

KATE Only a specimen letter Wont it be the usual thing

LADY SIMS To whom this is a new idea Is there a usual thing

KATE Oh yes

     She continues to type and LADY SIMS halfmesmerized gazes at
     her nimble fingers The useless woman watches the useful one and
     she sighs she could not tell why

LADY SIMS How quickly you do it It must be delightful to be able to do
something and to do it well

KATE Thankfully Yes it is delightful

LADY SIMS Again remembering the source of all her greatness But
excuse me I dont think that will be any use My husband wants me to
explain to you that his is an exceptional case He did not try to get
this honor in any way It was a complete surprise to him

KATE Who is a practical KATE and no dealer in sarcasm That is
what I have written

LADY SIMS In whom sarcasm would meet a dead wall But how could you
know

KATE I only guessed

LADY SIMS Is that the usual thing

KATE Oh yes

LADY SIMS They dont try to get it

KATE I dont know That is what we are told to say in the letters

     To her at present the only important thing about the letters is
     that they are ten shillings the hundred

LADY SIMS Returning to surer ground I should explain that my
husband is not a man who cares for honors So long as he does his
duty

KATE Yes I have been putting that in

LADY SIMS Have you But he particularly wants it to be known that he
would have declined a title were it not

KATE I have got it here

LADY SIMS What have you got

KATE Reading Indeed I would have asked to be allowed to decline
had it not been that I want to please my wife

LADY SIMS Heavily But how could you know it was that

KATE Is it

LADY SIMS Who after all is the one with the right to ask
questions Do they all accept it for that reason

KATE That is what we are told to say in the letters

LADY SIMS Thoughtlessly It is quite as if you knew my husband

KATE I assure you I dont even know his name

LADY SIMS Suddenly showing that she knows him Oh he wouldnt like
that

     And it is here that HARRY reenters in his city garments
     looking so gay feeling so jolly that we bleed for him However
     the annoying KATHERINE is to get a shock also

LADY SIMS This is the lady Harry

SIR HARRY Shooting his cuffs Yes yes Good morning my dear

     Then they see each other and their mouths open but not for
     words After the first surprise KATE seems to find some humor in
     the situation but HARRY lowers like a thundercloud

LADY SIMS Who has seen nothing I have been trying to explain to
her

SIR HARRY Ehwhat He controls himself Leave it to me Emmy Ill
attend to her

     LADY SIMS goes with a dread fear that somehow she has vexed her
     lord and then HARRY attends to the intruder

SIR HARRY With concentrated scorn You

KATE As if agreeing with him Yes its funny

SIR HARRY The shamelessness of your daring to come here

KATE Believe me it is not less a surprise to me than it is to you I
was sent here in the ordinary way of business I was given only the
number of the house I was not told the name

SIR HARRY Withering her The ordinary way of business This is what
you have fallen toa typist

KATE Unwithered Think of it

SIR HARRY After going through worse straits Ill be bound

KATE With some grim memories Much worse straits

SIR HARRY Alas laughing coarsely My congratulations

KATE Thank you Harry

SIR HARRY Who is annoyed as any man would be not to find her
abject Eh What was that you called me madam

KATE Isnt it Harry On my soul I almost forget

SIR HARRY It isnt Harry to you My name is Sims if you please

KATE Yes I had not forgotten that It was my name too you see

SIR HARRY In his best manner It was your name till you forfeited
the right to bear it

KATE Exactly

SIR HARRY Gloating I was furious to find you here but on second
thoughts it pleases me From the depths of his moral nature There
is a grim justice in this

KATE Sympathetically Tell me

SIR HARRY Do you know what you were brought here to do

KATE I have just been learning You have been made a knight and I was
summoned to answer the messages of congratulation

SIR HARRY Thats it thats it You come on this day as my servant

KATE I who might have been Lady Sims

SIR HARRY And you are her typist instead And she has four
menservants Oh I am glad you saw her in her presentation gown

KATE I wonder if she would let me do her washing Sir Harry Her want
of taste disgusts him

SIR HARRY With dignity You can go The mere thought that only a
few flights of stairs separates such as you from my innocent
children

     He will never know why a new light has come into her face

KATE Slowly You have children

SIR HARRY Inflated Two He wonders why she is so long in
answering

KATE Resorting to impertinence Such a nice number

SIR HARRY With an extra turn of the screw Both boys

KATE Successful in everything Are they like you Sir Harry

SIR HARRY Expanding They are very like me

KATE Thats nice Even on such a subject as this she can be ribald

SIR HARRY Will you please to go

KATE Heigho What shall I say to my employer

SIR HARRY That is no affair of mine

KATE What will you say to Lady Sims

SIR HARRY I flatter myself that whatever I say Lady Sims will accept
without comment

     She smiles heaven knows why unless her next remark explains
     it

KATE Still the same Harry

SIR HARRY What do you mean

KATE Only that you have the old confidence in your profound knowledge
of the sex

SIR HARRY Beginning to think as little of her intellect as of her
morals I suppose I know my wife

KATE Hopelessly dense I suppose so I was only remembering that
you used to think you knew her in the days when I was the lady He is
merely wasting his time on her and he indicates the door She is not
sufficiently the lady to retire worsted Well goodby Sir Harry
Wont you ring and the four menservants will show me out But he
hesitates

SIR HARRY In spite of himself As you are here there is something
I want to get out of you Wishing he could ask it less eagerly Tell
me who was the man

     The strange womanit is evident now that she has always been
     strange to himsmiles tolerantly

KATE You never found out

SIR HARRY I could never be sure

KATE Reflectively I thought that would worry you

SIR HARRY Sneering Its plain that he soon left you

KATE Very soon

SIR HARRY As I could have told you But still she surveys him with
the smile of Mona Lisa The badgered man has to entreat Who was he
It was fourteen years ago and cannot matter to any of us now Kate
tell me who he was

     It is his first youthful moment and perhaps because of that she
     does not wish to hurt him

KATE Shaking a motherly head Better not ask

SIR HARRY I do ask Tell me

KATE It is kinder not to tell you

SIR HARRY Violently Then by James it was one of my own pals Was
it Bernard Roche She shakes her head It may have been some one who
comes to my house still

KATE I think not Reflecting Fourteen years You found my letter
that night when you went home

SIR HARRY Impatient Yes

KATE I propped it against the decanters I thought you would be sure to
see it there It was a room not unlike this and the furniture was
arranged in the same attractive way How it all comes back to me Dont
you see me Harry in hat and cloak putting the letter there taking a
last look round and then stealing out into the night to meet

SIR HARRY Whom

KATE Him Hours pass no sound in the room but the ticktack of the
clock and then about midnight you return alone You take

SIR HARRY Gruffly I wasnt alone

KATE The picture spoiled No Oh Plaintively Here have I all
these years been conceiving it wrongly She studies his face I
believe something interesting happened

SIR HARRY Growling Something confoundedly annoying

KATE Coaxing Do tell me

SIR HARRY We wont go into that Who was the man Surely a husband has
a right to know with whom his wife bolted

KATE Who is detestably ready with her tongue Surely the wife has a
right to know how he took it The womans love of bargaining comes to
her aid A fair exchange You tell me what happened and I will tell
you who he was

SIR HARRY You will Very well

     It is the first point on which they have agreed and forgetting
     himself he takes a place beside her on the fireseat He is
     thinking only of what he is to tell her but she womanlike is
     conscious of their proximity

KATE Tastelessly Quite like old times He moves away from her
indignantly Go on Harry

SIR HARRY Who has a manful shrinking from saying anything that is to
his disadvantage Well as you know I was dining at the club that
night

KATE Yes

SIR HARRY Jack Lamb drove me home Mabbett Green was with us and I
asked them to come in for a few minutes

KATE Jack Lamb Mabbett Green I think I remember them Jack was in
Parliament

SIR HARRY No that was Mabbett They came into the house with me
andwith sudden horrorwas it him

KATE Bewildered Who

SIR HARRY Mabbett

KATE What

SIR HARRY The man

KATE What man Understanding Oh no I thought you said he came
into the house with you

SIR HARRY It might have been a blind

KATE Well it wasnt Go on

SIR HARRY They came in to finish a talk we had been having at the club

KATE An interesting talk evidently

SIR HARRY The papers had been full that evening of the elopement of
some countess woman with a fiddler What was her name

KATE Does it matter

SIR HARRY No Thus ends the countess We had been discussing the
thing andhe pulls a wry faceand I had been rather warm

KATE With horrid relish I begin to see You had been saying it
served the husband right that the man who could not look after his wife
deserved to lose her It was one of your favorite subjects Oh Harry
say it was that

SIR HARRY Sourly It may have been something like that

KATE And all the time the letter was there waiting and none of you
knew except the clock Harry it is sweet of you to tell me His face
is not sweet The illiterate woman has used the wrong adjective I
forget what I said precisely in the letter

SIR HARRY Pulverizing her So do I But I have it still

KATE Not pulverized Do let me see it again

     She has observed his eye wandering to the desk

SIR HARRY You are welcome to it as a gift

     The fateful letter a poor little dead thing is brought to light
     from a locked drawer

KATE Taking it Yes this is it Harry how you did crumple it
She reads not without curiosity Dear husbandI call you that for
the last timeI am off I am what you call making a bolt of it I wont
try to excuse myself nor to explain for you would not accept the
excuses nor understand the explanation It will be a little shock to
you but only to your pride what will astound you is that any woman
could be such a fool as to leave such a man as you I am taking nothing
with me that belongs to you May you be very happyYour ungrateful
KATE PSYou need not try to find out who he is You will try but
you wont succeed She folds the nasty little thing up I may
really have it for my very own

SIR HARRY You really may

KATE Impudently If you would care for a typed copy

SIR HARRY In a voice with which he used to frighten his
grandmother None of your sauce Wincing I had to let them see it
in the end

KATE I can picture Jack Lamb eating it

SIR HARRY A penniless parsons daughter

KATE That is all I was

SIR HARRY We searched for the two of you high and low

KATE Private detectives

SIR HARRY They couldnt get on the track of you

KATE Smiling No

SIR HARRY But at last the courts let me serve the papers by
advertisement on a man unknown and I got my freedom

KATE So I saw It was the last I heard of you

SIR HARRY Each word a blow for her And I married again just as
soon as ever I could

KATE They say that is always a compliment to the first wife

SIR HARRY Violently I showed them

KATE You soon let them see that if one woman was a fool you still had
the pick of the basket to choose from

SIR HARRY By James I did

KATE Bringing him to earth again But still you wondered who he
was

SIR HARRY I suspected everybodyeven my pals I felt like jumping at
their throats and crying Its you

KATE You had been so admirable to me an instinct told you that I was
sure to choose another of the same

SIR HARRY I thought it cant be money so it must be looks Some dolly
face He stares at her in perplexity He must have had something
wonderful about him to make you willing to give up all that you had with
me

KATE As if he was the stupid one Poor Harry

SIR HARRY And it couldnt have been going on for long for I would have
noticed the change in you

KATE Would you

SIR HARRY I knew you so well

KATE You amazing man

SIR HARRY So who was he Out with it

KATE You are determined to know

SIR HARRY Your promise You gave your word

KATE If I mustShe is the villain of the piece but it must be
conceded that in this matter she is reluctant to pain him I am sorry
I promised Looking at him steadily There was no one Harry no one
at all

SIR HARRY Rising If you think you can play with me

KATE I told you that you wouldnt like it

SIR HARRY Rasping It is unbelievable

KATE I suppose it is but it is true

SIR HARRY Your letter itself gives you the lie

KATE That was intentional I saw that if the truth were known you might
have a difficulty in getting your freedom and as I was getting mine it
seemed fair that you should have yours also So I wrote my goodby in
words that would be taken to mean what you thought they meant and I
knew the law would back you in your opinion For the law like you
Harry has a profound understanding of women

SIR HARRY Trying to straighten himself I dont believe you yet

KATE Looking not unkindly into the soul of this man Perhaps that
is the best way to take it It is less unflattering than the truth But
you were the only one Summing up her life You sufficed

SIR HARRY Then what mad impulse

KATE It was no impulse Harry I had thought it out for a year

SIR HARRY A year Dazed One would think to hear you that I hadnt
been a good husband to you

KATE With a sad smile You were a good husband according to your
lights

SIR HARRY Stoutly I think so

KATE And a moral man and chatty and quite the philanthropist

SIR HARRY On sure ground All women envied you

KATE How you loved me to be envied

SIR HARRY I swaddled you in luxury

KATE Making her great revelation That was it

SIR HARRY Blankly What

KATE Who can be serene because it is all over How you beamed at me
when I sat at the head of your fat dinners in my fat jewelry surrounded
by our fat friends

SIR HARRY Aggrieved They werent so fat

KATE A side issue All except those who were so thin Have you ever
noticed Harry that many jewels make women either incredibly fat or
incredibly thin

SIR HARRY Shouting I have not Is it worth while to argue with
her any longer We had all the most interesting society of the day It
wasnt only business men There were politicians painters writers

KATE Only the glorious dazzling successes Oh the fat talk while we
ate too muchabout who had made a hit and who was slipping back and
what the noo house cost and the noo motor and the gold soupplates and
who was to be the noo knight

SIR HARRY Who it will be observed is unanswerable from first to
last Was anybody getting on better than me and consequently you

KATE Consequently me Oh Harry you and your sublime religion

SIR HARRY Honest heart My religion I never was one to talk about
religion but

KATE Pooh Harry you dont even know what your religion was and is and
will be till the day of your expensive funeral And here is the lesson
that life has taught her Ones religion is whatever he is most
interested in and yours is Success

SIR HARRY Quoting from his morning paper Ambitionit is the last
infirmity of noble minds

KATE Noble minds

SIR HARRY At last grasping what she is talking about You are not
saying that you left me because of my success

KATE Yes that was it And now she stands revealed to him I
couldnt endure it If a failure had come now and thenbut your success
was suffocating me She is rigid with emotion The passionate
craving I had to be done with it to find myself among people who had
not got on

SIR HARRY With proper spirit There are plenty of them

KATE There were none in our set When they began to go downhill they
rolled out of our sight

SIR HARRY Clenching it I tell you I am worth a quarter of a
million

KATE Unabashed That is what you are worth to yourself Ill tell
you what you are worth to me exactly twelve pounds For I made up my
mind that I could launch myself on the world alone if I first proved my
mettle by earning twelve pounds and as soon as I had earned it I left
you

SIR HARRY In the scales Twelve pounds

KATE That is your value to a woman If she cant make it she has to
stick to you

SIR HARRY Remembering perhaps a rectory garden You valued me at
more than that when you married me

KATE Seeing it also Ah I didnt know you then If only you had
been a man Harry

SIR HARRY A man What do you mean by a man

KATE Leaving the garden Havent you heard of them They are
something fine and every woman is loath to admit to herself that her
husband is not one When she marries even though she has been a very
trivial person there is in her some vague stirring toward a worthy
life as well as a fear of her capacity for evil She knows her chance
lies in him If there is something good in him what is good in her
finds it and they join forces against the baser parts So I didnt give
you up willingly Harry I invented all sorts of theories to explain
you Your hardnessI said it was a fine want of mawkishness Your
coarsenessI said it goes with strength Your contempt for the weakI
called it virility Your want of ideals was clearsightedness Your
ignoble views of womenI tried to think them funny Oh I clung to you
to save myself But I had to let go you had only the one quality
Harry success you had it so strong that it swallowed all the others

SIR HARRY Not to be diverted from the main issue How did you earn
that twelve pounds

KATE It took me nearly six months but I earned it fairly She
presses her hand on the typewriter as lovingly as many a woman has
pressed a rose I learned this I hired it and taught myself I got
some work through a friend and with my first twelve pounds I paid for
my machine Then I considered that I was free to go and I went

SIR HARRY All this going on in my house while you were living in the
lap of luxury She nods By God you were determined

KATE Briefly By God I was

SIR HARRY Staring How you must have hated me

KATE Smiling at the childish word Not a bitafter I saw that
there was a way out From that hour you amused me Harry I was even
sorry for you for I saw that you couldnt help yourself Success is
just a fatal gift

SIR HARRY Oh thank you

KATE Thinking dear friends in front of you and me perhaps Yes
and some of your most successful friends knew it One or two of them
used to look very sad at times as if they thought they might have come
to something if they hadnt got on

SIR HARRY Who has a horror of sacrilege The battered crew you live
among nowwhat are they but folk who have tried to succeed and failed

KATE Thats it they try but they fail

SIR HARRY And always will fail

KATE Always Poor soulsI say of them Poor soulthey say of me It
keeps us human That is why I never tire of them

SIR HARRY Comprehensively Bah Kate I tell you Ill be worth half
a million yet

KATE Im sure you will Youre getting stout Harry

SIR HARRY No Im not

KATE What was the name of that fat old fellow who used to fall asleep
at our dinnerparties

SIR HARRY If you mean Sir William Crackley

KATE That was the man Sir William was to me a perfect picture of the
grand success He had got on so well that he was very very stout and
when he sat on a chair it was thus her hands meeting in front of
heras if he were holding his success together That is what you are
working for Harry You will have that and the half million about the
same time

SIR HARRY Who has surely been very patient Will you please to
leave my house

KATE Putting on her gloves soiled things But dont let us part in
anger How do you think I am looking Harry compared to the dull inert
thing that used to roll round in your padded carriages

SIR HARRY In masterly fashion I forget what you were like Im
very sure you never could have held a candle to the present Lady Sims

KATE That is a picture of her is it not

SIR HARRY Seizing his chance again In her weddinggown Painted by
an RA

KATE Wickedly A knight

SIR HARRY Deceived Yes

KATE Who likes LADY SIMSa piece of presumption on her part It
is a very pretty face

SIR HARRY With the pride of possession Acknowledged to be a beauty
everywhere

KATE There is a merry look in the eyes and character in the chin

SIR HARRY Like an auctioneer Noted for her wit

KATE All her life before her when that was painted It is a
spirituelle face too Suddenly she turns on him with anger for the
first and only time in the play Oh Harry you brute

SIR HARRY Staggered Eh What

KATE That dear creature capable of becoming a noble wife and
mothershe is the spiritless woman of no account that I saw here a few
minutes ago I forgive you for myself for I escaped but that poor lost
soul oh Harry Harry

SIR HARRY Waving her to the door Ill thank youIf ever there
was a woman proud of her husband and happy in her married life that
woman is Lady Sims

KATE I wonder

SIR HARRY Then you neednt wonder

KATE Slowly If I was a husbandit is my advice to all of themI
would often watch my wife quietly to see whether the twelvepound look
was not coming into her eyes Two boys did you say and both like you

SIR HARRY What is that to you

KATE With glistening eyes I was only thinking that somewhere there
are two little girls who when they grow upthe dear pretty girls who
are all meant for the men that dont get on Well goodby Sir Harry

SIR HARRY Showing a little human weakness it is to be feared Say
first that youre sorry

KATE For what

SIR HARRY That you left me Say you regret it bitterly You know you
do She smiles and shakes her head He is pettish He makes a terrible
announcement You have spoiled the day for me

KATE To hearten him I am sorry for that but it is only a
pinprick Harry I suppose it is a little jarring in the moment of your
triumph to find that there isone old friendwho does not think you a
success but you will soon forget it Who cares what a typist thinks

SIR HARRY Heartened Nobody A typist at eighteen shillings a week

KATE Proudly Not a bit of it Harry I double that

SIR HARRY Neatly Magnificent

     There is a timid knock at the door

LADY SIMS May I come in

SIR HARRY Rather appealingly It is Lady Sims

KATE I wont tell She is afraid to come into her husbands room
without knocking

SIR HARRY She is not Uxoriously Come in dearest

     Dearest enters carrying the sword She might have had the sense
     not to bring it in while this annoying person is here

LADY SIMS Thinking she has brought her welcome with her Harry the
sword has come

SIR HARRY Who will dote on it presently Oh all right

LADY SIMS But I thought you were so eager to practise with it

     The person smiles at this He wishes he had not looked to see if
     she was smiling

SIR HARRY Sharply Put it down

     LADY SIMS flushes a little as she lays the sword aside

KATE With her confounded courtesy It is a beautiful sword if I
may say so

LADY SIMS Helped Yes

     The person thinks she can put him in the wrong does she Hell
     show her

SIR HARRY With one eye on KATE Emmy the one thing your neck needs
is more jewels

LADY SIMS Faltering More

SIR HARRY Some ropes of pearls Ill see to it Its a bagatelle to me
KATE conceals her chagrin so she had better be shown the door He
rings I wont detain you any longer miss

KATE Thank you

LADY SIMS Going already You have been very quick

SIR HARRY The person doesnt suit Emmy

LADY SIMS Im sorry

KATE So am I madam but it cant be helped Goodby your
ladyshipgoodby Sir Harry

     There is a suspicion of an impertinent courtesy and she is
     escorted off the premises by TOMBES The air of the room is
     purified by her going SIR HARRY notices it at once

LADY SIMS Whose tendency is to say the wrong thing She seemed such
a capable woman

SIR HARRY On his hearth I dont like her style at all

LADY SIMS Meekly Of course you know best

     This is the right kind of woman

SIR HARRY Rather anxious for corroboration Lord how she winced
when I said I was to give you those ropes of pearls

LADY SIMS Did she I didnt notice I suppose so

SIR HARRY Frowning Suppose Surely I know enough about women to
know that

LADY SIMS Yes oh yes

SIR HARRY Odd that so confident a man should ask this Emmy I know
you well dont I I can read you like a book eh

LADY SIMS Nervously Yes Harry

SIR HARRY Jovially but with an inquiring eye What a different
existence yours is from that poor lonely wretchs

LADY SIMS Yes but she has a very contented face

SIR HARRY With a stamp of his foot All put on What

LADY SIMS Timidly I didnt say anything

SIR HARRY Snapping One would think you envied her

LADY SIMS Envied Oh nobut I thought she looked so alive It was
while she was working the machine

SIR HARRY Alive Thats no life It is you that are alive Curtly
Im busy Emmy He sits at his writingtable

LADY SIMS Dutifully Im sorry Ill go Harry
Inconsequentially Are they very expensive

SIR HARRY What

LADY SIMS Those machines

     When she has gone the possible meaning of her question startles
     him The curtain hides him from us but we may be sure that he will
     soon be bland again We have a comfortable feeling you and I that
     there is nothing of HARRY SIMS in us

     SCENE The sittingroom at the OLLIVANTS in a small town
     upState It is an evening late in the spring

     A simple room is disclosed bearing the traces of another
     generation Oldfashioned windowdoors at the right overlooking
     the garden open on a porch another door in back opening on the
     hallway A large fireplace at the left now concealed by an
     embroidered screen the horsehair furniture several terracotta
     statuettes and a woodcut or two on the walls create the subtle
     atmosphere of the past There is a lamp on the table and another
     on a bracket by the door in back Moonlight filters through the
     windowdoors

     The OLLIVANTS are discovered together MARY a rather plain
     woman of about twentyfive with a suggestion of quick
     sensibilities is standing lost in thought looking out into the
     garden Her mother EMILY nearing fifty quiet and subdued in
     manner is seated at the table trimming a hat Occasionally she
     looks at MARY stops her work glances at her husband closes her
     eyes as though tired and then resumes The silence continues for
     some time broken only by the rattle of the town paper which
     GEORGE OLLIVANT is reading He is well on in middle life with a
     strong determined face not entirely without elements of kindness
     and deep feeling When he finishes he folds the paper puts it on
     the table knocks the ashes carefully from his pipe into his hand
     and throws them behind the screen takes off his spectacles and
     wipes them as he too looks over toward his daughter still gazing
     absently into the garden Finally after a slight hesitation he
     goes to her and puts his arm about her she is startled but smiles
     sweetly

OLLIVANT Affectionately Glad to be home again Mary

MARY Evasively The garden is so pretty

OLLIVANT Hasnt changed much eh

MARY It seems different perhaps its the night

OLLIVANT I guess it isnt up to its usual standard Havent seen your
mother there so often this spring

EMILY Quietly This dry spell is not good for flowers

OLLIVANT Its only the cultivated flowers that need care cant help
thinking that when I see the wild ones so hardy in my fields on the
hill Turning to EMILY and patting her Is there any of that spray
mixture left Emily dear

EMILY I havent looked lately

OLLIVANT Ill order some tomorrow Taking up his pipe again and
looking for the tobacco Think it would be a good idea daughter if
youd spray those rosebushes every couple of weeks The bugs are a pest
this spring Wheres my tobacco

EMILY On the mantel

OLLIVANT Wish you would always leave it on the table you know how I
hate to have things changed

     OLLIVANT goes to the mantel filling his pipe and while his back
     is turned MARY makes a quick questioning gesture to her mother
     who sighs helplessly MARY ponders a moment

MARY Hows Ben been doing these two years father

OLLIVANT Hasnt your brother written you

MARY Only oncewhen I left home he disapproved too

OLLIVANT Had an older brothers feeling of wanting to take care of you
Mary

MARY Yes I know Hows he doing

OLLIVANT Hes commencing to get on his feet Takes time and money for
any one to get started these days

MARY But hes still in partnership with Bert Taylor isnt he

OLLIVANT Yes Hed have been somewhere if hed worked in with me as I
did with my father Things should be handed down Offered him the
chance tried to make him take it as your mother knows but that
college chumnice enough fellow Ive heardturned his head another
way Lighting his pipe and puffing slowly Its best to humor a
young fellows ideas if he sticks them out but Id like to have had us
all here together now The place is big enough even if he should want to
marry Your mother and I came here you know when your grandfather was
still alive

MARY Then Ben isnt making any money

OLLIVANT Reluctantly Not yetto speak of

EMILY Quietly But hes promised to pay his father back Mary

MARY I see Thoughtfully College and then more help to get
started because hes a man

OLLIVANT Complacently Hell have to support a family some day
Ive had to keep that in mind

MARY Id like to have a real talk with him

OLLIVANT When did his letter say hed be coming for a visit Emily

EMILY The fifteenth

MARY Not till then Thats too bad

OLLIVANT Eh

MARY After exchanging a quick glance with her mother and gaining
courage Father I hope you didnt misunderstand my coming back

OLLIVANT Not at all We all make mistakesespecially when were young
Perhaps I was a bit hasty when you left home but I knew youd soon see
I was right I didnt think it would take you two yearsbut perhaps if
Id written you before youd have come sooner I told your mother Id
like to make it easy for you to come home

MARY Mother suggested that you write me

OLLIVANT Well I suppose you might put it that way I always felt she
thought I was a bit hard on you but Im not one to back down easily

MARY Dont blame me then father if I showed I was your daughter

OLLIVANT Lets forget my feeling but naturally I was set back

MARY Because you didnt take my going seriously until I was actually
leaving

OLLIVANT I couldnt get it into my head then and I cant now how any
girl would want to leave a home like this where you have everything
You dont know how lucky you areor maybe you have realized it Look
about you and see what other girls have Is it like this Trees
flowers and a lake view thats the best in the county Why one can
breathe here and even taste the air Every time I come back from a
business trip it makes a new man of me Ask your mother Eh Emily When
I sit out there on the porch in the cool evenings it makes me feel at
ease with the world to know that the place is mine and that Ive
raised a family and can take care of them all Ben had to go I
supposeits the way with sons but I thought you at least would stay
here daughter in this old house where you were born where I was born
where all your early associations

MARY Shuddering I hate associations

OLLIVANT Eying her Well Id like to know where you get that
from Not from your mother and me We like them dont we Emily Why
your mothers hardly ever even left herebut you had to up and get out

MARY Yes Thats right father I had to

OLLIVANT He stops smoking and looks at her sharply Had to Who
made you

MARY Reluctantly It was something inside me

OLLIVANT In spite of himself Tushthat foolishness

MARY Quickly Dont make it hard for us again

OLLIVANT I made it hard Mary Because I objected to your leaving your
mother here alone

MARY I remember you said I was a foolish stagestruck girl

OLLIVANT Well youre over that arent you

MARY Thats just where you are mistaken father Slowly Thats why
I asked you if you hadnt misunderstood my coming back

OLLIVANT Suspiciously Then why did you come at all

MARY Im human I wanted to see you and mother so I came when you
generously wrote me Im not going to stay and spray the roses

OLLIVANT He eyes her tensely and controls himself with an effort
So you are not going to stay with your mother and me

MARY Affectionately Ill come see you as often as I can and

OLLIVANTand make a hotel of your home MARY is silent Dont you
see your mother is getting older and needs somebody to be here

EMILY With a quiet assurance I have never been so well and
contented

OLLIVANT Tenderly I know better Emily cant I see youre getting
thinner and older Stopping her protests Now let me manage this
dear Its a girls place to stay at home You know my feelings about
that Suppose anything should happen to your mother what would I do

MARY So its not mother alone you are thinking of

OLLIVANT Tersely Im thinking of your place at homedoing a
womans work Im not proud of having my daughter off earning her own
living as though I couldnt support her

EMILY George

MARY I thought it was only because I was on the stage

OLLIVANT Well its not the most heavenly place is it A lot of
narrowminded fools here in town thought I was crazy to let you go I
knew how they felt I grinned and bore it You were my daughter and I
loved you and I didnt want them to think any less of you by their
finding out you were leaving against my wish

MARY Slowly with comprehension Thats what hurt you

OLLIVANT Well I blamed myself a bit for taking you to plays and liking
them myself

MARY People here will soon forget about me and merely be sorry for you

OLLIVANT Persuasively Why Mary Ive made it easy for you to
stay I told every one you were coming home for good Theyll think me a
fool if

MARY Tenderly You meant what was dear and good father but you
had no right to say that Im sorry

OLLIVANT I did it because I thought you had come to your senses

MARY Firmly I never saw so clearly as I do now

OLLIVANT Bluntly Then youre stubbornplain stubbornnot to
admit failure

MARY Startled Failure

OLLIVANT I know what the newspapers said Ben sent them to me

MARY Which ones

OLLIVANT Why all of them I guess

MARY Did he send you the good ones

OLLIVANT Were there any

MARY Oh I see So Ben carefully picked out only those which would
please you

OLLIVANT Sarcastically Please me

MARY Yes because you and he didnt want me to succeed because you
thought failure would bring me home But dont you think Ill let some
cub reporter settle things for me Ill never come home through
failurenever

OLLIVANT Kindly Ben and I only want to protect you Mary

MARY Why do men always want to protect women

OLLIVANT Because we know the world

MARY Yes but you dont know me Father you still think Im only a
foolish stagestruck girl and want flowers and men and my name in big
letters It isnt that

OLLIVANT Well what is it then

MARY OhI want to be an artist I dont suppose you can understand it
I didnt myself at first I was born with it but didnt know what it
was till that first time you took me to the theatre

OLLIVANT So it was all my fault

MARY It isnt anybodys fault its just a fact I knew from that day
what I wanted to do I wanted to actto create I dont care whether I
play a leading lady or a scrubwoman if I can do it with truth and
beauty

OLLIVANT Well you havent done much of either have you What have you
got to show for our unhappiness What have you got ahead of you

MARY Nothingdefinite

OLLIVANT Incredulously Yet youre going to keep at it

MARY Yes

OLLIVANT What do you think of that Emily

MARY I am going to the city Monday

OLLIVANT Persistently But what will you do when you get there

MARY What Ive done before hunt a job tramp the streets call at the
offices be snubbed and insulted by officeboyskeep at it till I get
something to do

OLLIVANT Come come Mary dont make me lose patience Put your pride
in your pocket Youve had your fling Youve tried and failed Give it
all up and stay home here where you can be comfortable

MARY With intense feeling Father I cant give it up It doesnt
make any difference how they treat me how many times I get my notice
and dont even make good according to their standards I cant give it
up I simply cant It keeps gnawing inside me and driving me on Its
therealways there and I know if I keep at work I will succeed I know
it I know it

     MARY throws herself into the chair much stirred EMILYS eyes
     have eagerly followed her throughout this as though responding
     sympathetically but OLLIVANT has stood in silence watching her
     apparently without comprehension

OLLIVANT Not without kindness Something inside Huh Have you any
clear idea what shes talking about Emily

     MARY gives a short hurt cry and goes quickly to the window
     looking out and controlling herself with an effort

EMILY Softly as she looks at MARY I think I understand

OLLIVANT I dont Something inside I never had anything like that
bothering me Whats it all mean

EMILY Quietly So many people use the same words but cannot
understand each other

OLLIVANT Well you seem to think its mighty important Mary whatever
it is but its too much for me If you had something to show for it I
wouldnt mind But youre just where you started and you might as well
give up

EMILY George

OLLIVANT Now I dont know much about the stage Emily but Ben does He
says youre not made for an actress Mary you havent got a chance

MARY Turning Father

OLLIVANT Cant you see your failure isnt your own fault If you were a
beauty like Helen Safford or some of those other starsbut youre
not pretty why youre not even goodlooking and

MARY With bitter vehemence Oh dont go any further I know all
that But I dont care how I look off the stage if only I can grow
beautiful on it Ill create with so much inner power and beauty that
people will forget how I look and only see what I think and feel I can
do it I have done it Ive made audiences feel and even got my notice
because the stagemanager said I was too natural Helen
Saffordwhats she A professional beauty with everything outside and
nothing in You think of her eyes her mouth and her profile but does
she touch you so you remember I know her work Wait till I get a chance
to play a scene with herwhich they may give me because Im not
goodlookingIll make them forget shes on the stage the first ten
minutesyes and you and Ben too if youll come Helen Safford Huh
Why people will remember me when shes only a lithograph

OLLIVANT Well then why havent you had your chance

MARY Quickly Because most managers feel the way you and Ben do
And not having a lovely profile and a fashionplate figure stands
between me and a chance even to read a part let alone play it Thats
what eats the heart out of me mother and makes me hate my face every
time I sit down to put on the grease paint

OLLIVANT Well dont blame me for that

MARY Going to her mother who takes her hand You can laugh at me
father you dont understand Its foolish to talk But oh mother why
is such beauty given to women like Helen Safford who have no inner need
of it and here am I with a real creative gift wrapped up in a
nondescript package which stands between me and everything I want to do
With determination But I willultimately I will make good in
spite of my looks others have And what Ive suffered will make me a
greater artist

OLLIVANT In a matteroffact tone Are you sure all this isnt
overconfidence and vanity

MARY I dont care what you call it Its what keeps me working

OLLIVANT Quickly Working But how can you work without an
engagement

MARY That is the hard part of our life waiting waiting for a chance
to work But dont think I stand still when I havent an engagement I
dont dare Thats why I keep at my voice work and dancing and

OLLIVANT Suddenly interrupting Dancing and voice work when you
have no engagements Would you mind telling me who is paying the bills

MARY Indignantly Father

OLLIVANT I think I have the right to ask that

MARY Have you

OLLIVANT I am your father

MARY With quiet dignity You thought youd force me here at home to
do as you wished because you paid for my food and clothes when you took
that from me you ceased to have that right Dont forget since I left
youve not helped me with my work or given me a penny

OLLIVANT Suspiciously Mary No thats not why you went away
from home

MARY No

OLLIVANT Or you met some man there and

MARY No

OLLIVANT There is some man

MARY Why a man

OLLIVANT Damn them I know them Breaking Good God Mary dear
you havent Answer me daughter

MARY Calmly No theres been no need of that

     He has been violently shaken at the thought looks at her
     intently believes her and then continues in a subdued manner

OLLIVANT Then who helped you Ben

MARY How could he help me Are men the only ones who help women

EMILY Quietly Tell him Mary its best now

OLLIVANT Turning slowly to her in surprise You knew and have kept
it from me

EMILY Calmly as she puts down the hat she has been trimming I
found I hadnt lost my old skill though its been a good many years
since I held a brushsince before we were married George I had an
idea I thought would sell paper dolls with little handpainted dresses
on separate sheets they were so much softer than the printed kind and
children like anything soft I wrote to Mr Aylwinyou rememberhe was
so kind to me years before He had called here once before when you were
away and asked after my work He used to think I had such promise He
found an opportunity to use the dolls as a specialty and when I
explained he induced some other firms to use all I can paint too They
pay me very well I made enough each month to help Mary when she went
behind

OLLIVANT Incredulously You After you heard me say when she left I
wouldnt give her a cent

EMILY Looking fondly at MARY You were keeping Ben werent you

OLLIVANT Butthatsthats different

EMILY I didnt see why we shouldnt help both our children

OLLIVANT Perplexed by this he turns to MARY And you took it

MARY Yes

OLLIVANT You knew how she got the money

MARY Yes

OLLIVANT Your mother working herself sick for you and you took it

EMILY I told you Ive never been so happy

MARY Simply I couldnt bargain with what I felt I had to study
Id have taken anything gotten it anywhere I had to live You didnt
help me Ben and I both went against your will but you helped him
because he was your son I was only your daughter

     OLLIVANT eyes her and seems to be struggling with himself He is
     silent a long while as they both watch him Finally after several
     efforts he speaks with emotion

OLLIVANT Mary II didnt realize how much you meant to me tilltill
I thought of what might have happened to you without my help
Wouldwould you have stayed on in the city ifif your mother hadnt
helped you

MARY Firmly Yes father I would have stayed on

OLLIVANT After a pause Then I guess what you feel is stronger
than all your mother and I tried to teach you Are you too proud to
take help from menow

MARY Simply No father till I succeed Then Ill pay you back
like Ben promised

OLLIVANT Hurt You dont think it was the money daughter It would
have cost to keep you here It wasnt that

MARY No it was your father speaking and his father and his father
Looking away wistfully And perhaps I was speaking for those before
me who were silent or couldnt be heard

OLLIVANT With sincerity I dont exactly understand that any more
than the feeling you spoke of driving you from home But I do see what
you mean about brothers and sisters You seem to think boys and girls
are the same But theyre not Men and women are different You may not
know it but your mother had foolish ideas like you have when I first
knew her She was poor and didnt have a mother to support her and she
had to work for a living Shed about given up when I met hertrying to
work at night to feed herself in the day while studying But she was
sensible when a good man came along who could support her she married
him and settled down Look how happy shes been here with a home of her
own that is a homewith associations and children Where would she be
struggling today trying to paint pictures for a living Why theres
lots of men who can paint pictures and too few good wives for
hardworking decent men who want a familywhich is Gods law Youll
find that out one of these days and youll give yourself as she did
Some day a man will come and youll want to marry him How could you if
you keep on with your work going about the country

MARY Quietly You leave mother at times dont you

OLLIVANT Ive got to

MARY So may I

OLLIVANT And the children

MARY Theyd have a share of my life

OLLIVANT A mighty big share if youre human I tell you Ask your
mother if you think theyre easy coming and bringing up

MARY And now theyve left her Dear mother what has she to do

OLLIVANT Well if you ever get a husband with those ideas of yours
youll see what a wife has to do He goes to her Mary it isnt
easy all this youve been saying But your mother and I are left alone
and perhaps we have got different views than you But if ever you do
see it our way and give up or fail well come back to us
understand

MARY Going to him and kissing him I understand how hard it was for
you to say that And remember I may come back a success

OLLIVANT Yes I suppose they all think that its what keeps them
going But some day when youre in love and marry youll see it all
differently

MARY Father what if the man does not comeor the children

OLLIVANT WhyHe halts as though unable to answer her Nonsense
Hell come never fear they always do

MARY I wonder

OLLIVANT He goes affectionately to EMILY who has been staring
before her during this Emily dear No wonder the flowers have been
neglected Well youll have time to spray those roses yourself Ill
get the spray mixture tomorrow Kisses her tenderly Painting paper
dolls with a change of clothes When I might have been sending her the
money without ever feeling it No more of that dear you dont have to
now I shant let you get tired and sick Thats one thing I draw the
line at He pats her again looks at his watch and then goes slowly
over to the windowdoors Well its getting late Ill lock up
Looking up at sky Paper says it will rain tomorrow

EMILY Very quietly so only MARY can hear At the art school they
said I had a lovely sense of color Your father is so kind but he
doesnt know how much I enjoyed painting againeven those paper dolls

MARY Comprehending in surprise Mother You too

EMILY Fearing lest OLLIVANT should hear Sh

     OLLIVANT closes the doors and eyes the women thoughtfully

OLLIVANT Better fasten the other windows when you come Goodnight

     He goes out slowly as mother and daughter sit there together

CHARACTERS

    JUDGE the exchanger of miseries
    IMP office boy to the JUDGE
    A POOR MAN
    A VAIN WOMAN
    A RICH CITIZEN




THE EXCHANGEC


SCENE I

     The curtain rises upon an office scene Seemingly there is nothing
     unusual about this office it has tables chairs a filing cabinet
     and a hatrack A portion of the office is railed off at the right
     Within this enclosed space is a commodious desk and swivelchair
     and the filing cabinet stands against the wall This railedoff
     portion of the office belongs exclusively to the JUDGE Here he
     is wont to spend many hourssometimes to read or write and again
     perhaps he will just sit and ponder upon the vagaries of mankind
     The JUDGE is a tall spare man with rather long gray hair which
     shows beneath the skullcap that he always wears When we first see
     him he is reading a letter and evidently he is not pleased for
     he is tapping with impatient fingers upon his desk

     At the left of the stage is a heavily curtained door which leads
     to an inner room At centre rear is another door which evidently
     leads to the street as it is through this door that the POOR MAN
     the VAIN WOMAN and the RICH CITIZEN will presently enter
     each upon his special quest The hatrack stands near the street
     door and we glimpse a soft black hat and a long black overcoat
     hanging upon it

     Down stage to the left is a flattopped desk littered with papers
     and letters This desk has two large drawers wherein a number of
     miscellaneous articles might be kept It is at this desk that we
     catch our first glimpse of IMP He is busily writing in a huge
     ledger and he seems to be enjoying his work for he chuckles the
     while IMP is a little rogue he looks it and acts it and we
     feel that he has a Mephistophelian spirit He wears a darkgreen
     tightfitting uniform trimmed with red braid His saucy little
     round cap is always cocked over one eye He is ever chuckling
     impishly and we feel that he is slyly gleeful over the weaknesses
     of mankind and the difficulties that beset them

IMP Throws down his pen chuckles and half standing on the rungs of
his chair and balancing himself against his desk surveys the ledger
Your honor Ive all the miseries listed to date and a fine lot there is
to choose from Everything from bunions to old wives for exchange

JUDGE Scowls and impatiently taps the letter he is reading Here is
another one A woman suspects her husband of a misalliance Wants to
catch him but is so crippled with rheumatism she cant get about Wants
us to exchange her rheumatism for something that wont interfere with
either her walking or her eyesight

IMP Referring to the ledger and running his finger along the lines
We have a defective heart or a lazy liver that we could give her

JUDGE Irritably tossing the letter over to IMP She would not be
satisfied People never are They always want to change their miseries
but never their vices Each thinks his own cross heavier than others
have to bear but he is very willing to make light of his own weaknesses
and shortcomings He thinks they are not half so bad as his neighbors
I have tried for years to aid distressed humanity but I cant satisfy
them I am growing tired of it all Imp People need a lesson and
theyre going to get it too I am going to

     Knock is heard at the street door JUDGE sighs turns to his
     desk and begins to write IMP sweeps the litter of papers on his
     desk into a drawer closes ledger and goes to answer knock

IMP Here comes another misery

     IMP opens the door to admit the POOR MAN who is very shabbily
     dressed He hesitates looks around the room as if he were in the
     wrong place and then addresses IMP in a loud whisper

POOR MAN Indicating the JUDGE with a motion of his head Is that
him

IMP Whispering loudly his reply Yes that is his honor

POOR MAN Still whispering and showing signs of nervousness Do I
dare speak to him

IMP Enjoying the situation and still whispering Yes but be
careful what you say

POOR MAN Takes off his hat approaches slowly to the railing and
speaks humbly Your honor ISwallows hard clears throat Your
honor Ive a little favorto ask of you

JUDGE Looking coldly at the POOR MAN Well

POOR MAN You see your honor Ive been poor all my life Ive never
had much fun I dont ask for a lot of money butI would like enough
so that I could have some swell clothes andso that I could eat
drink and be merry with the boys You know I just want to have a good
time Do you think you could fix it for me Judge

JUDGE Gazes at him sternly for a moment So you just want to have a
good time Want me to take away your poverty I suppose you have no
moral weakness you want to change no defects in your character that you
want to better

POOR MAN Stammering and twirling his hat Why why Judge II am
not a bad man Ofof course I have my faults but thenIve never
committed any crimes I guess I stack up pretty fair as men go Im just
awful tired of being poor and never having any fun Couldnt you help me
out on that point Judge

JUDGE Sighs wearily and turns to IMP Bring me the ledger

     IMP gives him the ledger in which he has been writing JUDGE
     opens it and then speaks sharply to the POOR MAN

JUDGE You understand do you my good man that if I take away your
poverty and give you enough money for your good time you will have to
accept another misery

POOR MAN Eagerly Yes your honor thats all right Im willing

JUDGE Scanning ledger Very well Let us see Here is paralysis

POOR MAN Hesitatingly Well II couldnt have avery good time
ifif I was paralyzed

JUDGE Shortly No I suppose not How about a glass eye

POOR MAN Anxiously Please your honor if Im going to have a good
time I need two good eyes I dont want to miss anything

JUDGE Wearily turning over the leaves of the ledger A man left his
wife here for exchange perhaps you would like her

POOR MAN Shifting from one foot to the other and nervously twirling
his hat Oh Judge oh no please no I dont want anybodys old
castoff wife

JUDGE Becoming exasperated Well choose something and be quick
about it Here is lumbago gout fatness old age and

IMP Interrupting and walking quickly over to the railing Excuse
me Judge but maybe the gentleman would like the indigestion that Mr
Potter left when he took old Mrs Pratts fallen arches

POOR MAN Eagerly Indigestion Sure That will be fine I wont
mind a little thing like indigestion if I can get rid of my poverty

JUDGE Sternly Very well Raise your right hand Repeat after me
I swear to accept indigestion for better or for worse as my portion of
the worlds miseries so help me God

POOR MAN Solemnly I swear to accept indigestion for better or for
worse as my portion of the worlds miseries so help me God

JUDGE To IMP Show this gentleman to the changingroom

     POOR MAN follows IMP who conducts him to the heavily curtained
     door The POOR MAN throws out his chest and swaggers a bit as a
     man might who had suddenly come into a fortune IMP swaggers
     along with him

IMP Wont you have a grand time though Ill get you a menu card so
that you can be picking out your dinner

POOR MAN Joyfully slapping IMP on the back Good idea and Ill
pick out a regular banquet

     Pausing a moment before he passes through the curtains he smiles
     and smacks his lips in anticipation Exit

JUDGE Speaks disgustedly to IMP There you are Hes perfectly
satisfied with his morals Has no defects in his character Just wants
to have a good time

     Sighs heavily and turns back to his writing IMP nods his head
     in agreement and chuckles slyly

     The street door opens slowly and the VAIN WOMAN stands upon the
     threshold She does not enter at once but stands
     posingpresumably she desires to attract attention and she is
     worthy of it She has a superb figure and her rich gowning
     enhances it Her fair face reveals a shallow prettiness but the
     wrinkles of age are beginning to leave telltale lines upon its
     smoothness As IMP hurries forward to usher her in she sweeps
     grandly past him to the centre of the stage IMP stops near the
     door with his hands on his hips staring after her then takes a
     few steps in imitation of her She turns around slowly and
     sauntering over to the railing coughs affectedly and as the
     JUDGE rises and bows curtly she speaks in a coaxing manner

VAIN WOMAN Judge I have heard that you are very kind and I have been
told that you help people out of their troubles so I have a little
favor to ask of you

JUDGE Coldly Yes I supposed so go on

VAIN WOMAN Archly Well you know that I am a famous beauty in
fact both my face and my form are considered very lovely She turns
around slowly that he may see for himself Great and celebrated men
have worshipped at my feet I simply cannot live without admiration It
is my very life But Judge plaintively horrid wrinkles are
beginning to show in my face Intensely Oh I would give anything
do anything to have a smooth youthful face once more Please oh
please wont you take away these wrinkles touching her face with her
fingers and give me something in their stead

JUDGE Looking directly at her and speaking coldly Are you
satisfied with yourself in other ways Is your character as beautiful as
your face Have you no faults or weaknesses that you want exchanged

VAIN WOMAN Uncertainly Why Idont know what you mean I am just
as good as any other woman and lots better than some I know I go to
church and I subscribe to the charities and I belong to the best
clubs Anxiously Oh please Judge its these wrinkles that make
me so unhappy Wont you exchange them You dont want me to be unhappy
do you Please take them away

JUDGE Wearily looking over the ledger Oh very well Ill see what
I can do for you To IMP Fetch a chair for this lady

     IMP gives her a chair and she sits facing front IMP returns to
     his desk perches himself upon it and watches the VAIN WOMAN
     interestedly JUDGE turns over the leaves of the ledger

JUDGE I have a goitre that I could exchange for your wrinkles

VAIN WOMAN Protestingly clasping her hands to her throat Oh
heavens no That would ruin my beautiful throat See Throwing back
her fur and exposing her neck in a lowcut gown I have a lovely neck
IMP makes an exaggerated attempt to see

JUDGE Glances coldly at her and then scans ledger again Well how
about hayfever

VAIN WOMAN Reproachfully Oh Judge how can you suggest such a
thing Watery eyes and a red nose the worst enemy of beauty there is I
simply couldnt think of it I want something that wont show

JUDGE Disgustedly turns to filing cabinet and looks through a series
of cards withdraws one and turns back to VAIN WOMAN Perhaps this
will suit you Refers to card A woman has grown very tired of her
husband and wants to exchange him for some other burden

VAIN WOMAN Indignantly What I accept a man that some other woman
doesnt want Certainly not I prefer one that some other woman does
want

JUDGE Irritated puts the card back in its place and turns upon the
VAIN WOMAN crossly I fear that I cannot please you and I do not have
time to

IMP Interrupts and runs over to the railing speaking soothingly to
the JUDGE Excuse me Judge but maybe the lady would like deafness in
exchange for her wrinkles Deafness wouldnt show so it couldnt spoil
her face or her elegant figure

JUDGE Wearily No it wont show Deafness ought to be a good thing
for you

VAIN WOMAN Consideringly Whyyesthat might do Butwell it
wouldnt show Ive a notion to take it Pauseshe seems to consider
and meditate The JUDGE stares at her coldly IMP grins impudently
She rises leisurely sighs All right Ill accept it

JUDGE Sharply Hold up your right hand She raises hand Do you
swear to accept deafness for better or for worse as your portion of the
worlds miseries so help you God

VAIN WOMAN Sweetly Oh yes I do Judge

JUDGE To IMP Show the lady to the changingroom

IMP Escorts her to the curtained door with rather mock deference
No deafness wont show at all and youll have em all crazy about you
Draws aside curtains for her to pass Take second booth to your
right

     VAIN WOMAN stands posing a moment She smiles radiantly and pats
     her cheeks softly with her hands then with a longdrawn sigh of
     happiness she exits IMP bows low and mockingly after her
     vanishing form his hand on his heart

JUDGE Sarcastically Do her faults or shortcomings trouble her Not
at all Perfectly satisfied with herself except for a few wrinkles in
her face Vain women Bah

IMP Yes sir women have queer notions

     An imperative rap at the streetdoor immediately followed by the
     rappers abrupt entrance We see an importantappearing personage
     His arrogant bearing and commanding pose lead us to believe that he
     is accustomed to prompt attention It is the RICH CITIZEN
     exceedingly well groomed His manner is lordly but he addresses
     the JUDGE in a bored tone When IMP scampers to meet him the
     RICH CITIZEN hands him his hat and cane and turns at once to the
     JUDGE IMP examines the hat and cane critically hangs them on the
     hatrack and returns to his desk where he again perches to watch
     the RICH CITIZEN

RICH CITIZEN Lighting a cigarette I am addressing the Judge am I
not

JUDGE Shortly You are

RICH CITIZEN Languidly between puffs of his cigarette Well
Judge life has become rather boresome so I thought I would drop in and
ask you to do me a small favor

JUDGE Wearily Yes WeWhat is your grievance

RICH CITIZEN Nonchalantly Oh I wouldnt say grievance exactly
You see my dear Judge it is this way I am a very rich and influential
citizen a prominent member of society and I am very much sought after

JUDGE Frigidly Oh indeed

RICH CITIZEN In a very bored manner Yes Women run after me day
and night Ambitious mothers throw their marriageable daughters at my
head Men seek my advice on all matters I am compelled to head this and
that committee Smokes languidly

JUDGE Sharply Well go on

RICH CITIZEN Really Judge my prestige has become a burden I want to
get away from it all I would like to become a plain ordinary man with
an humble vocation the humbler the better so that people will cease
bothering me

JUDGE Sarcastically Is your prestige all that troubles you Dont
worry about your morals I suppose Satisfied with your habits and
character

RICH CITIZEN Coldly What have my habits or morals got to do with
my request Scornfully Certainly I am not one of your saintly men
I live as a man of my station should live and I think I measure up very
well with the best of them I am simply bored and I would like a change
I would like to be a plain man with an humble calling

JUDGE Ironically Ill see what we have in humble callings He
looks at the ledger turning the leaves over slowly We have several
bartenders vocations

RICH CITIZEN Wearily smoking No Too many people about all the
time and too much noise

JUDGE Well heres a janitors job open to you

RICH CITIZEN Impatiently throwing away his cigarette No I dont
like that either Too confining Too many people bickering at you all
the time I want to get out in the open away from crowds

JUDGE Sighing and turning over the leaves of the ledger then
hopefully Heres the very thing for you thenpostman in a rural
district

RICH CITIZEN Showing vexation No no no Too many old women
that want to gossip I tell you I want to get away from women Havent
you something peaceful and quiet something that would take me out in
the quiet of the early morning when the birds are singing

JUDGE Closing ledger with a bang and rising Well youre too
particular and I have not time to bother with you I bid you good
after

IMP Slides from his desk runs to railing and speaks suavely
Excuse me Judge but maybe the gentleman would like the vocation of
milkman That is earlymorning work And you remember a milkman left
his job here when he took that old wornout senators position

JUDGE Sharply to RICH CITIZEN Well how about it Does a
milkmans vocation suit you Its earlymorning hours fresh air and no
people about

RICH CITIZEN Musingly Well the very simplicity and quietness of
it is its charm It rather appeals to me He ponders a moment Yes
by Jove Ill take it

JUDGE Sternly Hold up your right hand Do you solemnly swear to
accept for better or for worse the vocation of milkman as your lot in
life so help you God

RICH CITIZEN I do

JUDGE To IMP Show this gentleman to the changingroom

IMP While escorting him to the curtained door Yes sir you will
lead the simple life Fresh air fresh milk no people just cowsand
they cant talk Holding aside the curtains Third booth sir

RICH CITIZEN Musingly The simple lifepeace and quietness

     Exit

JUDGE In disgust Its no use Imp They all cling to their vices
but they are very keen to change some little cross or condition that
vexes themor think vexes them

IMP Its strange that people always want something different from what
they have

     IMP opens a drawer in his desk and takes out a bottle evidently
     filled with tablets which he holds up shaking it and chuckling
     He hunts in the drawer again and this time brings forth a huge
     eartrumpet which he chucklingly places an his table beside the
     bottle of tablets

JUDGE Dont let any more in Imp I cant stand another one today I
am going to write a letter and then go home

IMP All right sir

JUDGE I am feeling very tired what I really need is a vacation A
seatrip would put me right By the way Imp where is that
transatlantic folder that I told you to get

     IMP picks up the folder from his desk and takes it to the JUDGE
     who studies it attentively IMP returns to his own desk where
     he again looks in a drawer and brings forth a menu card which he
     glances over grinning mischievously

     The former POOR MAN reenters from the changingroom He is
     well dressed and taking a wellfilled wallet from his pocket he
     looks at it gloatingly However from time to time a shade of
     annoyance passes over his face and he puts his hand to the pit of
     his stomach IMP runs to meet him and hands him the menu that he
     has been reading

IMP Heres a menu from the Gargoyle Say you sure do look swell
Looking him over admiringly

FORMER POOR MAN Grinning happily Some class to me now eh
Looking at menu And you watch me pick out a real dinner Sits
down at left front First Ill have a cocktail thenlets seeIll
haveanother cocktail Next oysters and he frowns and presses his
hand to the pit of his stomach keeping up a massaging
motiongreenturtle soup sand dabschicken breasts

     They become absorbed over the menu

     The VAIN WOMAN reenters from the changingroom She now has a
     smooth face and she is looking at herself in a handglass
     smiling and touching her face delightedly She walks over to the
     railing and leans over it to the JUDGE He looks up
     questioningly

VAIN WOMAN Smiling Oh I am so happy again Am I not beautiful

JUDGE Pityingly You are a vain foolish woman

     Since she is deaf she does not hear his words but thinks he is
     complimenting her She smiles at him coyly

VAIN WOMAN Ah Judge you too are susceptible to my charms

     The JUDGE in great exasperation puts away his papers thrusts
     the transatlantic folder in his pocket hastily closes his desk
     and hurries to the hatrack puts on his overcoat slips his
     skullcap into his pocket and puts on his soft black hat Then
     with a shrug of his shoulders and a wave of his hand indicative of
     disgust he slips quietly out

     The VAIN WOMAN saunters past the FORMER POOR MAN stops near
     him posing and begins to put on her gloves He looks at her
     admiringly then getting to his feet makes an elaborate but
     awkward bow

FORMER POOR MAN Excuse me lady but Ive had a big piece of luck
today and I want to celebrate so I am having a big dinner Wont you
join me and help me have a good time

VAIN WOMAN Looking at him blankly and trying to fathom what he has
said Ohwhy what did you say

FORMER POOR MAN Hesitating and a bit surprised WhyerI said
that I had a big piece of luck today and I am going to celebrate I am
having a fine dinner and I just asked ififyou wouldnt have dinner
with me

VAIN WOMAN Still looking blank and a little confused then smiling
archly and acting as though she had been hearing compliments she speaks
affectedly Really do you think so Looking down and smoothing her
dress But then every one tells me that I am

FORMER POOR MAN Puzzled turns to IMP for help Just what is her
trouble Nut

IMP Secretly gleeful She is stonedeaf You had better write it

FORMER POOR MAN Never No deaf ones for me

     Turns away and consults menu again VAIN WOMAN poses and
     frequently looks in handglass to reassure herself

     FORMER RICH CITIZEN reenters from the changingroom He is
     dressed in shabby overalls jumper and an old hat He has a pipe
     in his mouth He walks arrogantly over to the FORMER POOR MAN and
     addresses him

FORMER RICH CITIZEN Give me a light

FORMER POOR MAN Trying to live up to his fine clothes and wallet full
of money looks the FORMER RICH CITIZEN over snubbingly Say who do
you think you are You light out see

FORMER RICH CITIZEN Very much surprised stands nonplussed a
moment Well upon my word II

     He stops short in his speech walks haughtily over to the
     railing where he stands glowering at the FORMER POOR MAN The
     FORMER POOR MAN starts for the street door but IMP runs after
     him waving the bottle of tablets

IMP Ill sell you these for two bits

FORMER POOR MAN What is that

IMP Grinning Indigestion tablets

FORMER POOR MAN Puts his hand to his stomach and laughs a little
lamely Keep em I dont need em

     VAIN WOMAN fastens her fur and starts for the streetdoor giving
     the FORMER RICH CITIZEN a snubbing look as she passes him IMP
     stops her and offers the eartrumpet

IMP You might need this Ill sell it for a dollar

     She does not hear what he says but she looks her scorn at the
     eartrumpet and walks proudly out

FORMER RICH CITIZEN Fumbling at his pocket as if to find a watch
Boy what time is it I havent my watch

IMP Grinning mischievously Time to milk the cows

     The FORMER RICH CITIZEN starts angrily toward IMP then
     evidently thinking better of it shrugs his shoulders and stalks
     majestically to the streetdoor He pauses with it partly open
     turns as if to speak to IMP drawing himself up haughtilya
     ludicrous figure in his shabby outfitthen he goes abruptly out
     slamming the door

     IMP doubles himself up in a paroxysm of glee as the curtain
     falls


SCENE II

     A fortnight has passed The curtain rises upon the same
     stagesetting The JUDGE is not about but we see IMP asleep in
     a chair All seems quiet and serene But suddenly the streetdoor
     opens noisily and the FORMER POOR MAN bursts into the room He
     is panting as though he had been running He is haggard and seems
     in great pain for occasionally he moans He looks wildly about the
     room and seeing IMP asleep in the chair he rushes to him and
     shakes him roughly IMP wakes slowly yawning and rubbing his
     eyes

FORMER POOR MAN Frantically The Judge where is he I must see him
at once

IMP Yawning Youre too early He isnt down yet

     Settles himself to go to sleep again

FORMER POOR MAN Walking the floor and holding his hands to his
stomach Dont go to sleep again Im nearly crazy What time does the
Judge get here Where does he live Cant we send for him

IMP Indifferently Oh he is liable to come any minuteand then he
may not come for an hour or two

FORMER POOR MAN Pacing the floor moaning and rubbing his stomach
Oh I cant stand it much longer Its driving me wild I tell you I do
wish the Judge would come

IMP Getting up from his chair and keeping step with the FORMER POOR
MAN Whats the matter I thought all you wanted was to eat drink and
be merry

FORMER POOR MAN Frantically waving his arms Eat drink and be
merry be Everything I eat gives me indigestion something awful
everything I drink gives it to me worse How can I be merry when I am in
this torment all the time I tell you this pain is driving me mad I
want to get rid of it quick Oh why doesnt the Judge come

IMP Whats the Judge got to do with it

FORMER POOR MAN Pathetically I am going to beg him to take back
this indigestion and give me back my poverty It was not so bad after
all not nearly so bad as this pain in my stomach

     The streetdoor opens slowly and a sorrowful woman enters She
     is weeping softly It is the VAIN WOMAN Gone is her posing and
     her proud manner She walks humbly to the railing and not seeing
     the JUDGE she turns to IMP The FORMER POOR MAN looks at the
     VAIN WOMAN frowningly muttering Whats she here for Then he
     sits down at the left and rocks back and forth in misery

VAIN WOMAN Tearfully I must see the Judge right away please

IMP Languidly He isnt down yet Youre too earl

VAIN WOMAN Interrupting Tell him that it is very important that I
am in great distress and that he must see me at once

IMP Loudly I said that he was not down yet

     Seeing that she does not understand he takes a writingpad from
     his desk scribbles a few words and standing in front of her
     holds it up for her to read

VAIN WOMAN After reading Oh when will he be here Cant you get
him to come right away Oh I am so unhappy She walks the floor in
agitation

     The FORMER POOR MAN grunts in irritation and turns his back on
     her

VAIN WOMAN I cannot hear a word that is said to me No one seems to
want me around and I am not invited out any more I have the feeling
that people are making fun of me instead of praising my beauty Oh it
is dreadful to be deaf Getting hysterical I want the Judge to take
away this deafness I would rather have my wrinkles

     IMP shakes his head in pretended sympathy saying Too bad too
     bad

     She misunderstands and cries out

VAIN WOMAN Has the Judge given away my wrinkles I want them back I
want my very own wrinkles too Wrinkles are distinguishedlooking
Beginning to sob I dont want to be deaf any longer

IMP Running over to the FORMER POOR MAN Say this lady feels very
bad Cant you cheer her up a little

FORMER POOR MAN Who is still rocking back and forth with his own
misery looks up at IMP in disgust Cheerherup Me Whats the
joke

     The VAIN WOMAN walks to the curtained door looks in as if
     seeking something then returns to a chair where she sits weeping
     softly

     A peculiar thumping is heard at the streetdoor The FORMER POOR
     MAN jumps to his feet in expectancy hoping it is the JUDGE IMP
     also stands waiting The door opens as though the person that
     opened it did so with difficulty The FORMER RICH CITIZEN hobbles
     in He is ragged and dirty and one foot is bandaged which causes
     him to use a crutch He carries a large milkcan He hobbles
     painfully to the centre of the stage The FORMER POOR MAN grunts
     with disappointment and sits down again rubbing away at his
     stomach The VAIN WOMAN sits with bowed head silently weeping
     The FORMER RICH CITIZEN looks about then addresses IMP in a
     rather husky voice

FORMER RICH CITIZEN I wish to see the Judge at once It is most urgent

IMP With an illconcealed smile You cant see the Judge at once

FORMER RICH CITIZEN Impatiently Why not I told you it was most
urgent

IMP Grinning openly Because he isnt here He hasnt come in yet
Whats your trouble

FORMER RICH CITIZEN Vehemently Trouble Everythings the trouble
I have been abused insulted overworkedeven the cows have kicked me
Looking down at his bandaged foot I cant stand it I wont stand
it I want back my proper place in the world where I am respected and
where I can rest and sleep and mingle with my kind He hobbles to a
chair and sits down wearily

FORMER POOR MAN Getting up from his chair walks over to the FORMER
RICH CITIZEN waggles his finger in his face and speaks fretfully
What cause have you to squeal so If you had indigestion like I have all
the time you might be entitled to raise a holler Why I cant eat a
thing without having the most awful pain right here puts his hand to
the pit of his stomach and when I take a drink oh heavens it

FORMER RICH CITIZEN Interrupting contemptuously You big baby
howling about the stomachache If you had a mansized trouble there
might be some excuse for you Now I who have been used to wealth and
respect have been subjected to the most gruelling ordeals why in that
dairy there were a million cows and they kicked me and horned me and
I

VAIN WOMAN Walks over to them interrupting their talk and speaks in
a voice punctuated with sniffing sobs Havesniff either of you
gentlemen sniff ever been deaf Sniff sniff It is a terrible
thing sniff for a beautiful woman like I am sniff to have such
an affliction Sniff sniff sniff

     FORMER RICH CITIZEN shrugs his shoulders indifferently and limps
     to the other side of the stage where he sits

FORMER POOR MAN Stalks over to the railing where he leans limply
Lord deliver me from a sniffling woman

     IMP who is perched on his desk chuckles wickedly of their
     sufferings VAIN WOMAN sinks dejectedly into the chair vacated by
     the FORMER RICH CITIZEN

     A knock is heard at the streetdoor The FORMER POOR MAN and
     the FORMER RICH CITIZEN start forward eagerly expecting the
     JUDGE Even the VAIN WOMAN seeing the others rise gets to her
     feet hopefully IMP hastily slides from his desk and pulling
     down his tight little jacket and cocking his round little cap a
     little more over one eye goes to see who knocks A messenger hands
     him a letter and silently departs

IMP Importantly Letter for me from the Judge

FORMER POOR MAN A letter Why doesnt he come himself

FORMER RICH CITIZEN Send for him boy

IMP Grins at FORMER RICH CITIZEN in an insolent manner Well
well I wonder what the Judge is writing to me for Its queer he would
send me a letter

     He looks the letter over carefully both sides holds it up to
     the light smells it shakes it The two men and the woman grow
     more and more nervous

FORMER POOR MAN Extremely irritated For goodness sake open it
and read it

FORMER RICH CITIZEN Yes yes and dont be so long about it

     VAIN WOMAN simply stands pathetically and waits IMP walks over
     to his desk hunts for a knife finally finds one looks letter
     over again then slowly slits the envelope and draws out letter
     which he reads silently to himself They are breathlessly waiting
     IMP whistles softly to himself

IMP Well what do you think of that

FORMER POOR MAN Excitedly What is itwhy dont you tell us

FORMER RICH CITIZEN Pounding with his crutch on the floor Come
come dont keep me waiting like this

IMP Reads letter again silently chuckling All right Here it is
Reads

     MY DEAR IMP

     I have tried faithfully for years to aid distressed humanity but
     they are an ungrateful lot of fools and I wash my hands of them
     When this letter reaches you I will be on the high seas and I am
     never coming back So write Finis in the big old ledger of
     miseries and shut up shop for the Exchange is closedforever

Yours in disgust THE JUDGE

     They all stand dazed a moment The VAIN WOMAN sensing that
     something terrible has happened rushes from one to the other
     saying What is it What has happened IMP gives her the letter
     to read

FORMER POOR MAN In a perfect frenzy My God Indigestion all the
rest of my days

VAIN WOMAN After reading letter collapses in a chair hysterically
sobbing out Deaf always deaf Oh what shall I do

FORMER RICH CITIZEN Leaning heavily on his crutch and shaking his
free hand clenched in anger This is an outrage I am rich and have
influence and I shall take steps toto

     IMP laughs mockingly The man looks down at his milkspattered
     clothes his bandaged foot and letting his crutch fall to the
     floor sinks dejectedly into a chair burying his face in his
     hands

     IMP dangles his keys and opens the streetdoor as an invitation
     for them to go The FORMER POOR MAN is the first to start moving
     dazedly and breathing hard IMP offers him the bottle of
     indigestion tablets the man grasps them eagerly tipping IMP
     who chuckles as he pockets the money The FORMER POOR MAN takes
     a tablet as he exits The VAIN WOMAN bowed with sorrow moves
     slowly toward the door IMP touches her arm and offers the
     eartrumpet She accepts it with a wild sob tipping IMP who
     again chuckles as he pockets the money The last we see of the
     VAIN WOMAN she is trying to hold the eartrumpet to her ear and
     exits sobbing The FORMER RICH CITIZEN still sits in his chair
     his head in his hands IMP picks up the milkcan and tapping
     the man not too gently on the shoulder thrusts the milkcan at him
     and makes a significant gesture indicative ofTHIS WAY OUT The
     man rises dejectedly picks up his crutch takes the milkcan and
     hobbles painfully toward the door IMP doubles himself up in wild
     Mephistophelian glee as the

shell never think of me the same For she knows as well as I what
pledge Ill be breakingwhat sacred pledge

JOEL What you mean

ANDREW No matter no matter this is gush

     He returns to the fire and begins to fumble over the contents of
     his knapsack JOEL watches him idly

JOEL One of her curls

ANDREW Looking at a lock of hair in the firelight No the babys
little Andys Some day theyll tell him how his father He winces
and puts the lock away

JOEL Going toward the embankment Listen

ANDREW Ties up the package muttering Son of a traitor

JOEL Tiptoeing back Its crowedthats her

     Leaping to his feet ANDREW stares toward the embankment where
     the flag is dipped then turns his back to it closing his eyes and
     gripping his hands

     After a pause silently the figure of a young woman emerges from
     the dark and stands on the embankment She is bareheaded and ill
     clad

     JOEL touches ANDREW who turns and looks toward her Silently
     she steals down to him and they embrace

ANDREW My Nell

ELLEN Nearly a year

ANDREW Now at last

ELLEN Hold me close Andy

ANDREW Youre better

ANDREW Moving from her with a hoarse laugh Dare Dare I be
damned by God and all his angels Ha Come were slow

JOEL Time enough

ELLEN Sinking upon JOELS knapsack as a seat leans her head on her
hands and looks strangely at ANDREW Id better have written Im
afraid

ANDREW Controlling his emotion Now dont take it that way Ive
considered it all

ELLEN With deep quiet Blasphemously

ANDREW Reasonably my brave wife When I enlisted I did so in a dream
I dreamed I was called to love and serve our country But that dream is
shattered This sordid war this political murder has not one single
principle of humanity to excuse its bloody sacrilege It doesnt deserve
my loyaltyour loyalty

ELLEN Are you saying thisfor my sake What of God and his angels

ANDREW Not looking at her If we had a just causea cause of
liberty like that in Seventysix if to serve ones country meant to
serve God and his angelsthen yes a man might put away wife and
child He might say I will not be a husband a father I will be a
patriot But nowlike thistangled in a web of spiderscaught in a
grabnet of politiciansand you you and our babyboy like thishell

ELLEN Slowly So then when little Andy grows up

ANDREW Groaning I say that the only thing

ELLEN I am to tell him

ANDREW Defiantly Tell him his father deserted his country and
thanked God for the chance Looking about him passionately Here
He tears a part of the flag from its standard and reaches it toward
her Youre cold put this round you

     As he is putting the strip of colored silk about her shoulders
     there rises faint yet close by a sound of fifes and flutes
     playing the merry marchstrains of Yankee Doodle

     At the same time there enters along the embankment dimly
     enveloped in a great cloak a tall FIGURE which pauses beside
     the standard of the torn flag silhouetted against the first pale
     streaks of the dawn


ELLEN Gazing at ANDREW Whats the matter

ANDREW Listening Who are they Where is it

JOEL Starts alertly He hears something

ANDREW Why should they play before daybreak

THE FIGURE Hark ayonder

ANDREW Listening Is it thunder

THE FIGURE Have ye forgot

ANDREW The voice I remember nowNiagara

     With awe ANDREW looks toward THE FIGURE who stands shrouded
     and still facing the dawn From far off comes a sound as of
     falling waters and with thata deep murmurous voice which seems
     to issue from THE FIGURES cowl

THE VOICE I am the Voice that was heard of your fathers and your
fathers fathers Mightiermightier I shall be heard of your sons I
am the Million in whom the one is lost and I am the One in whom the
millions are saved Their ears shall be shut to my thunders their eyes
to my blinding stars In shallow streams they shall tap my lifeblood
for gold With dregs of coal and of copper they shall pollute me In
the mystery of my mountains they shall assail me in the majesty of my
forests strike me down with engine and derrick and millstone bind me
their slave Some for a lust some for a love shall desert me One and
one for his own shall fall away Yet one and one and one shall return
to me for life the deserter and the destroyer shall recreate me
Primeval their lifeblood is mine My pouring waters are passion my
lightnings are laughter of man I am the One in whom the millions are
saved and I am the Million in whom the one is lost

ANDREW Yearningly to THE FIGURE Your face

     THE FIGURE turns majestically away ANDREW clings to him

ANDREW Your face

     In the shadow of the flag THE FIGURE unmuffles for an instant

     Peering dazzled ANDREW staggers back with a low cry and
     covering his eyes falls upon the embankment

     From away left the thrumming of a jewsharp is heard playing
     The StarSpangled Banner

     From the right enter JOEL and ELLEN

     Descending from the embankment THE FIGURE stands apart

JOEL Well Colonel Average times up

ELLEN Seeing ANDREWS prostrate form hastens to him Andy
Whats happened

ANDREW Rising slowly Come here Ill whisper it

     He leads her beside the embankment beyond which the dawn is
     beginning to redden

JOEL Yonders the sergeants jewsharp Thats our signal Nell So
long colonel

THE FIGURE Nodding So long sonny

ANDREW Holding ELLENS hands passionately You understand You
do

ELLEN Looking in his eyes I understand dear

     They kiss each other

JOEL Calls low Come you married turtles The roads clear Follow
me now Sneak

     Carrying his knapsack JOEL climbs over the embankment and
     disappears

     The thrumming of the jewsharp continues

     ELLEN taking the strip of silk flag from her shoulders ties it
     to the standard

ANDREW Faintly God bless you

ELLEN As they part hands Goodby

     THE FIGURE has remounted the embankment wherein the distincter
     glow of the red dawnthe gray folds of his cloak hanging from his
     shoulders resemble the halfclosed wings of an eagle the beaked
     cowl falling as a kind of visor before his face concealing it

THE FIGURE Come little gal

     ELLEN goes to him and hides her face in the great cloak As she
     does so he draws from it a paper writes on it and hands it to
     ANDREW with the powderhorn

THE FIGURE By the by Andy heres that scurity Them heres my
initials theyre all whats needful Jest file this in the right
pigeonhole and youll draw your pay Keep your upper lip boy Ill
meet ye later mebbe at Lundys Lane

ANDREW Wistfully Youll take her home

THE FIGURE Yes reckon shell housekeep for your uncle till you get
back wont ye Nellie Come dont cry little gal Well soon git
quainted Taint the fust time sweethearts has called me Uncle

     Flinging back his great cloak he throws one wing of it with his
     arm about her shoulders thus with half its reverse side draping
     her with shining stripes and stars By the same action his own
     figure is made partly visiblethe legs clad in the tight
     instepstrapped trousers blue and white of the Napoleonic era
     Holding the girl gently to himwhile her face turns back toward
     ANDREWhe leads her silhouetted against the sunrise along the
     embankment and disappears

     Meantime the thrumming twang of the jewsharp grows sweeter
     mellower modulated with harmonies that filling now the air with
     elusive strains of the American warhymn mingle with the faint
     dawntwitterings of birds

     ANDREW stares silently after the departed forms then slowly
     coming down into the intrenchment lifts from the ground his gun
     and ramrod leans on the gun andreading the paper in his hand by
     the growing lightmutters it aloud

U S A

     Smiling sternly he crumples the paper in his fist makes a wad
     of it and rams it into his gunbarrel

LADY AUGUSTA GREGORY

Lady Augusta Gregory one of the foremost figures in the Irish dramatic
movement was born at Roxborough County Galway Ireland in  She
was then a young woman says one who has described her in her early
married life very earnest who divided her hair in the middle and wore
it smooth on either side of a broad and handsome brow Her eyes were
always full of questions In her drawingroom were to be met men of
assured reputation in literature and politics and there was always the
best reading of the times upon her tables Lady Gregory has devoted her
entire life to the cause of Irish literature In  she visited the
United States and at a dinner given to her by The Outlook in New York
City she said

    I will not cease from mental strife
    Or let the sword fall from my hand
    Till we have built Jerusalem
    InIrelandsfair and lovely land

Lady Gregory with William Butler Yeats and John Millington Synge has
been the very life of the Irish drama The literary association of these
three has been highly fruitful She helped to found the Irish National
Theatre Society and for a number of years has been the managing force
of the celebrated Abbey Theatre in Dublin

Lady Gregorys chief interest has been in peasant comedies and
folkplays Her Spreading the News Hyacinth Halvey The Rising of
the Moon The Workhouse Ward and The Travelling Man are wellknown
contributions to contemporary drama

It is a noteworthy fact that most of the plays of the Irish dramatic
movement are oneact plays Much of Irish life lends itself admirably to
oneact treatment Hyacinth Halvey is one of Lady Gregorys best
productions This play contains a universal idea reputation is in great
measure a matter of a password or an emotion Hyacinth having a good
reputation thrust upon him may do as he likeshis good name clings to
him notwithstanding


PERSONS

     HYACINTH HALVEY
     JAMES QUIRKE a butcher
     FARDY FARREL a telegraph boy
     SERGEANT CARDEN
     MRS DELANE postmistress at Cloon
     MISS JOYCE the priests housekeeper




HYACINTH HALVEY

     SCENE Outside the postoffice at the little town of Cloon MRS
     DELANE at postoffice door MR QUIRKE sitting on a chair at
     butchers door A dead sheep hanging beside it and a thrush in a
     cage above FARDY FARRELL playing on a mouthorgan Trainwhistle
     heard


MRS DELANE There is the fouroclock train Mr Quirke

MR QUIRKE Is it now Mrs Delane and I not long after rising It
makes a man drowsy to be doing the half of his work in the nighttime
Going about the country looking for little stags of sheep striving to
knock a few shillings together That contract for the soldiers gives me
a great deal to attend to

MRS DELANE I suppose so Its hard enough on myself to be down ready
for the mailcar in the morning sorting letters in the halfdark Its
often I havent time to look who are the letters fromor the cards

MR QUIRKE It would be a pity you not to know any little news might be
knocking about If you did not have information of what is going on who
should have it Was it you maam was telling me that the new
subsanitary inspector would be arriving today

MRS DELANE Today it is he is coming and its likely he was in that
train There was a card about him to Sergeant Carden this morning

MR QUIRKE A young chap from Carrow they were saying he was

MRS DELANE So he is one Hyacinth Halvey and indeed if all that is
said of him is true or if a quarter of it is true he will be a credit
to this town

MR QUIRKE Is that so

MRS DELANE Testimonials he has by the score To Father Gregan they
were sent Registered they were coming and going Would you believe me
telling you that they weighed up to three pounds

MR QUIRKE There must be great bulk in them indeed

MRS DELANE It is no wonder he to get the job He must have a great
character so many persons to write for him as what there did

FARDY It would be a great thing to have a character like that

MRS DELANE Indeed I am thinking it will be long before you will get
the like of it Fardy Farrell

FARDY If I had the like of that of a character it is not here carrying
messages I would be Its in Noonans Hotel I would be driving cars

MR QUIRKE Here is the priests housekeeper coming

MRS DELANE So she is and there is the sergeant a little while after
her

     Enter MISS JOYCE

MRS DELANE Good evening to you Miss Joyce What way is his reverence
today Did he get any ease from the cough

MISS JOYCE He did not indeed Mrs Delane He has it sticking to him
yet Smothering he is in the nighttime The most thing he comes short
in is the voice

MRS DELANE I am sorry now to hear that He should mind himself well

MISS JOYCE Its easy to say let him mind himself What do you say to
him going to the meeting tonight

     SERGEANT comes in

MISS JOYCE Its for his reverences Freeman I am come Mrs Delane

MRS DELANE Here it is ready I was just throwing an eye on it to see
was there any news Good evening Sergeant

SERGEANT Holding up a placard I brought this notice Mrs Delane
the announcement of the meeting to be held tonight in the courthouse
You might put it up here convenient to the window I hope you are coming
to it yourself

MRS DELANE I will come and welcome I would do more than that for
you Sergeant

SERGEANT And you Mr Quirke

MR QUIRKE Ill come to be sure I forget whats this the meeting is
about

SERGEANT The Department of Agriculture is sending round a lecturer in
furtherance of the moral development of the rural classes Reads A
lecture will be given this evening in Cloon CourtHouse illustrated by
magiclantern slides Those will not be in it I am informed they were
all broken in the first journey the railway company taking them to be
eggs The subject of the lecture is The Building of Character

MRS DELANE Very nice indeed I knew a girl lost her character and
she washed her feet in a blessed well after and it dried up on the
minute

SERGEANT The arrangements have all been left to me the archdeacon
being away He knows I have a good intellect for things of the sort But
the loss of those slides puts a man out The thing people will not see
it is not likely it is the thing they will believe I saw what they call
tableauxstanding pictures you knowone time in Dundrum

MRS DELANE Miss Joyce was saying Father Gregan is supporting you

SERGEANT I am accepting his assistance No bigotry about me when there
is a question of the welfare of any fellow creatures Orange and green
will stand together tonight I myself and the stationmaster on the
one side your parish priest in the chair

MISS JOYCE If his reverence would mind me he would not quit the house
tonight He is no more fit to go speak at a meeting than pointing to
the one hanging outside QUIRKES door that sheep

SERGEANT I am willing to take the responsibility He will have no
speaking to do at all unless it might be to bid them give the lecturer
a hearing The loss of those slides now is a great annoyance to meand
no time for anything The lecturer will be coming by the next train

MISS JOYCE Who is this coming up the street Mrs Delane

MRS DELANE I wouldnt doubt it to be the new subsanitary inspector
Was I telling you of the weight of the testimonials he got Miss Joyce

MISS JOYCE Sure I heard the curate reading them to his reverence He
must be a wonder for principles

MRS DELANE Indeed it is what I was saying to myself he must be a
very saintly young man

     Enter HYACINTH HALVEY He carries a small bag and a large
     brownpaper parcel He stops and nods bashfully

HYACINTH Good evening to you I was bid to come to the postoffice

SERGEANT I suppose you are Hyacinth Halvey I had a letter about you
from the resident magistrate

HYACINTH I heard he was writing It was my mother got a friend he deals
with to ask him

SERGEANT He gives you a very high character

HYACINTH It is very kind of him indeed and he not knowing me at all
But indeed all the neighbors were very friendly Anything any one
could do to help me they did it

MRS DELANE Ill engage it is the testimonials you have in your parcel
I know the wrappingpaper but they grew in bulk since I handled them

HYACINTH Indeed I was getting them to the last There was not one
refused me It is what my mother was saying a good character is no
burden

FARDY I would believe that indeed

SERGEANT Let us have a look at the testimonials

     HYACINTH HALVEY opens a parcel and a large number of envelopes
     fall out

SERGEANT Opening and reading one by one He possesses the fire of
the Gael the strength of the Norman the vigor of the Dane the
stolidity of the Saxon

HYACINTH It was the chairman of the Poor Law Guardians wrote that

SERGEANT A magnificent example to old and young

HYACINTH That was the secretary of the De Wet Hurling Club

SERGEANT A shining example of the value conferred by an eminently
careful and highclass education

HYACINTH That was the national schoolmaster

SERGEANT Devoted to the highest ideals of his motherland to such an
extent as is compatible with a hitherto nonparliamentary career

HYACINTH That was the member for Carrow

SERGEANT A splendid exponent of the purity of the race

HYACINTH The editor of the Carrow Champion

SERGEANT Admirably adapted for the efficient discharge of all possible
duties that may in future be laid upon him

HYACINTH The new stationmaster

SERGEANT A champion of every cause that can legitimately benefit his
fellow creatures Why look here my man you are the very one to come
to our assistance tonight

HYACINTH I would be glad to do that What way can I do it

SERGEANT You are a newcomeryour example would carry weightyou must
stand up as a living proof of the beneficial effect of a high character
moral fibre temperancethere is something about it here I am
sureLooks I am sure I saw unparalleled temperance in some
place

HYACINTH It was my mothers cousin wrote thatI am no drinker but I
havent the pledge taken

SERGEANT You might take it for the purpose

MR QUIRKE Eagerly Here is an antitreating button I was made a
present of it by one of my customersIll give it to you sticks it
in HYACINTHS coat and welcome

SERGEANT That is it You can wear the button on the platformor a bit
of blue ribbonhundreds will follow your exampleI know the boys from
the Workhouse will

HYACINTH I am in no way wishful to be an example

SERGEANT I will read extracts from the testimonials There he is I
will say an example of one in early life who by his own unaided
efforts and his high character has obtained a profitable situation
Slaps his side I know what Ill do Ill engage a few cornerboys
from Noonans bar just as they are greasy and sodden to stand in a
groupthere will be the contrastthe sight will deter others from a
similar fatethats the way to do a tableauI knew I could turn out a
success

HYACINTH I wouldnt like to be a contrast

SERGEANT Puts testimonials in his pocket I will go now and engage
those ladssixpence each and well worth itnothing like an example
for the rural classes

     Goes off HYACINTH feebly trying to detain him

MRS DELANE A very nice man indeed A little high up in himself
maybe Im not one that blames the police Sure they have their own
bread to earn like every other one And indeed it is often they will let
a thing pass

MR QUIRKE Gloomily Sometimes they will and more times they will
not

MISS JOYCE And where will you be finding a lodging Mr Halvey

HYACINTH I was going to ask that myself maam I dont know the town

MISS JOYCE I know of a good lodging but it is only a very good man
would be taken into it

MRS DELANE Sure there could be no objection there to Mr Halvey There
is no appearance on him but what is good and the sergeant after taking
him up the way he is doing

MISS JOYCE You will be near to the sergeant in the lodging I speak of
The house is convenient to the barracks

HYACINTH Doubtfully To the barracks

MISS JOYCE Alongside of it and the barrackyard behind And thats not
all It is opposite to the priests house

HYACINTH Opposite is it

MISS JOYCE A very respectable place indeed and a very clean room you
will get I know it well The curate can see into it from his window

HYACINTH Can he now

FARDY There was a good many I am thinking went into that lodging and
left it after

MISS JOYCE Sharply It is a lodging you will never be let into or
let stop in Fardy If they did go they were a good riddance

FARDY John Hart the plumber left it

MISS JOYCE If he did it was because he dared not pass the police coming
in as he used with a rabbit he was after snaring in his hand

FARDY The schoolmaster himself left it

MISS JOYCE He neednt have left it if he hadnt taken to cardplaying
What way could you say your prayers and shadows shuffling and dealing
before you on the blind

HYACINTH I think maybe Id best look around a bit before Ill settle in
a lodging

MISS JOYCE Not at all You wont be wanting to pull down the blind

MRS DELANE It is not likely you will be snaring rabbits

MISS JOYCE Or bringing in a bottle and taking an odd glass the way
James Kelly did

MRS DELANE Or writing threatening notices and the police taking a
view of you from the rear

MISS JOYCE Or going to roadside dances or running after
goodfornothing young girls

HYACINTH I give you my word Im not so harmless as you think

MRS DELANE Would you be putting a lie on these Mr Halvey Touching
testimonials I know well the way you will be spending the evenings
writing letters to your relations

MISS JOYCE Learning OGrowneys exercises

MRS DELANE Sticking postcards in an album for the convent bazaar

MISS JOYCE Reading the Catholic Young Man

MRS DELANE Playing the melodies on a melodeon

MISS JOYCE Looking at the pictures in the Lives of the Saints Ill
hurry on and engage the room for you

HYACINTH Wait Wait a minute

MISS JOYCE No trouble at all I told you it was just opposite Goes

MR QUIRKE I suppose I must go upstairs and ready myself for the

FARDY Sure it mightnt be as bad as what you think

HYACINTH Will you tell me I ask you what way can I undo it

FARDY What is it you are wanting to undo

HYACINTH Will you tell me what way can I get rid of my character

FARDY To get rid of it is it

HYACINTH That is what I said Arent you after hearing the great
character they are after putting on me

FARDY That is a good thing to have

HYACINTH It is not Its the worst in the world If I hadnt it I
wouldnt be like a prize marigold at a show with every person praising
me

FARDY If I had it I wouldnt be like a head in a barrel with every
person making hits at me

HYACINTH If I hadnt it I wouldnt be shoved into a room with all the
clergy watching me and the police in the back yard

FARDY If I had it I wouldnt be but a messagecarrier now and a
clapper scaring birds in the summertime

HYACINTH If I hadnt it I wouldnt be wearing this button and brought
up for an example at the meeting

FARDY Whistles Maybe youre not so what those papers make you out
to be

HYACINTH How would I be what they make me out to be Was there ever any
person of that sort since the world was a world unless it might be
Saint Antony of Padua looking down from the chapel wall If it is like
that I was isnt it in Mount Melleray I would be or with the friars at
Esker Why would I be living in the world at all or doing the worlds
work

FARDY Taking up parcel Who would think now there would be so
much lies in a small place like Carrow

HYACINTH It was my mothers cousin did it He said I was not reared for
laboringhe gave me a new suit and bid me never to come back again I
darent go back to face himthe neighbors knew my mother had a long
familybad luck to them the day they gave me these Tears letters and
scatters them Im done with testimonials They wont be here to bear
witness against me

FARDY The sergeant thought them to be great Sure he has the samples of
them in his pocket Theres not one in the town but will know before
morning that you are the next thing to an earthly saint

HYACINTH Stamping Ill stop their mouths Ill show them I can be
a terror for badness Ill do some injury Ill commit some crime The
first thing Ill do Ill go and get drunk If I never did it before Ill
do it now Ill get drunkthen Ill make an assaultI tell you Id
think as little of taking a life as of blowing out a candle

FARDY If you get drunk you are done for Sure that will be held up
after as an excuse for any breaking of the law

HYACINTH I will break the law Drunk or sober Ill break it Ill do
something that will have no excuse What would you say is the worst
crime that any man can do

FARDY I dont know I heard the sergeant saying one time it was to
obstruct the police in the discharge of their duty

HYACINTH That wont do Its a patriot I would be then worse than
before with my picture in the weeklies Its a red crime I must commit
that will make all respectable people quit minding me What can I do
Search your mind now

FARDY Its what I heard the old people saying there could be no worse
crime than to steal a sheep

HYACINTH Ill steal a sheepor a cowor a horseif that will leave
me the way I was before

FARDY Its maybe in jail it will leave you

HYACINTH I dont careIll confessIll tell why I did itI give you
my word I would as soon be picking oakum or breaking stones as to be
perched in the daylight the same as that bird and all the town
chirruping to me or bidding me chirrup

FARDY There is reason in that now

HYACINTH Help me will you

FARDY Well if it is to steal a sheep you want you havent far to go

HYACINTH Looking around wildly Where is it I see no sheep

that James Quirke

MR QUIRKE Is that so And what now is there in it

up a dead cow that those never had a hand in

MRS DELANE Youre out of it

MR QUIRKE They had their faces blackened There is no man can say I
recognized them

MRS DELANE Thats not what theyre saying

MR QUIRKE Ill swear I did not hear their voices or know them if I did
hear them

MRS DELANE I tell you it has nothing to do with that It might be
better for you if it had

MR QUIRKE What is it so

MRS DELANE It is an order to the sergeant bidding him immediately to
seize all suspicious meat in your house There is an officer coming
down There are complaints from the Shannon Fort Barracks

MR QUIRKE Ill engage it was that pork

MRS DELANE What ailed it for them to find fault

MR QUIRKE People are so hard to please nowadays and I recommended
them to salt it

MRS DELANE They had a right to have minded your advice

MR QUIRKE There was nothing on that pig at all but that it went mad on
poor OGrady that owned it

MRS DELANE So I heard and went killing all before it

MR QUIRKE Sure its only in the brain madness can be I heard the
doctor saying that

MRS DELANE He should know

MR QUIRKE I give you my word I cut the head off it I went to the loss
of it throwing it to the eels in the river If they had salted the
meat as I advised them what harm would it have done to any person on
earth

MRS DELANE I hope no harm will come on poor Mrs Quirke and the
family

MR QUIRKE Maybe it wasnt that but some other thing

MRS DELANE Here is Fardy I must send the message to the sergeant
Well Mr Quirke Im glad I had the time to give you a warning

MR QUIRKE Im obliged to you indeed You were always very
neighborly Mrs Delane Dont be too quick now sending the message
There is just one article I would like to put away out of the house
before the sergeant will come

     Enter FARDY

MRS DELANE Here now Fardythats not the way youre going to the
barracks Any one would think you were scaring birds yet Put on your
uniform

     FARDY goes into office

Get your cap now its under the counter

     FARDY reappears and she gives him telegram

FARDY Ill bring it to the station Its there he was going

MRS DELANE You will not but to the barracks It can wait for him
there

     FARDY goes off MR QUIRKE has appeared at door

MR QUIRKE It was indeed a very neighborly act Mrs Delane and Im
obliged to you There is just one article to put out of the way The
sergeant may look about him then and welcome Its well I cleared the
premises on yesterday A consignment to Birmingham I sent The Lord be
praised isnt England a terrible country with all it consumes

MRS DELANE Indeed you always treat the neighbors very decent Mr
Quirke not asking them to buy from you

MR QUIRKE Just one article Turns to rack That sheep I brought in
last night It was for a charity indeed I bought it from the widow
woman at Kiltartan Cross Where would the poor make a profit out of
their dead meat without me Where now is it Well now I could have
swore that that sheep was hanging there on the rack when I went in

MRS DELANE You must have put it in some other place

MR QUIRKE Going in and searching and coming out I did not there
is no other place for me to put it Is it gone blind I am or is it not
in it it is

MRS DELANE Its not there now anyway

MR QUIRKE Didnt you take notice of it there yourself this morning

MRS DELANE I have it in my mind that I did but its not there now

MR QUIRKE There was no one here could bring it away

MRS DELANE Is it me myself you suspect of taking it James Quirke

MR QUIRKE Where is it at all It is certain it was not of itself it
walked away It was dead and very dead the time I bought it

MRS DELANE I have a pleasant neighbor indeed that accuses me that I
took his sheep I wonder indeed you to say a thing like that I to
steal your sheep or your rack or anything that belongs to you or to your
trade Thank you James Quirke I am much obliged to you indeed

MR QUIRKE Ah be quiet woman be quiet

MRS DELANE And let me tell you James Quirke that I would sooner
starve and see every one belonging to me starve than to eat the size of
a thimble of any joint that ever was on your rack or that ever will be
on it whatever the soldiers may eat that have no other thing to get or
the English that devour all sorts or the poor ravenous people thats
down by the sea

     She turns to go into shop

MR QUIRKE Stopping her Dont be talking foolishness woman Who
said you took my meat Give heed to me now There must some other
message have come The sergeant must have got some other message

MRS DELANE Sulkily If there is any way for a message to come that
is quicker than to come by the wires tell me what it is and Ill be
obliged to you

MR QUIRKE The sergeant was up here making an excuse he was sticking
up that notice What was he doing here I ask you

MRS DELANE How would I know what brought him

MR QUIRKE It is what he did he made as if to go awayhe turned back
again and I shavinghe brought away the sheephe will have it for
evidence against me

MRS DELANE Interested That might be so

MR QUIRKE I would sooner it to have been any other beast nearly ever I
had upon the rack

MRS DELANE Is that so

MR QUIRKE I bade the Widow Early to kill it a fortnight agobut she
would not she was that covetous

MRS DELANE What was on it

MR QUIRKE How would I know what was on it Whatever was on it it was
the will of God put it upon itwasted it was and shivering and
refusing its share

MRS DELANE The poor thing

MR QUIRKE Gone all to nothingwore away like a flock of thread It
did not weigh as much as a lamb of two months

MRS DELANE It is likely the inspector will bring it to Dublin

MR QUIRKE The ribs of it streaky with the dint of patent medicines

MRS DELANE I wonder is it to the Petty Sessions youll be brought or
is it to the Assizes

MR QUIRKE Ill speak up to them Ill make my defense What can the
army expect at fippence a pound

MRS DELANE It is likely there will be no bail allowed

MR QUIRKE Would they be wanting me to give them good quality meat out
of my own pocket Is it to encourage them to fight the poor Indians and
Africans they would have me Its the AntiEnlisting Societies should
pay the fine for me

MRS DELANE Its not a fine will be put on you Im afraid Its five
years in jail you will be apt to be getting Well Ill try and be a
good neighbor to poor Mrs Quirke

     MR QUIRKE who has been stamping up and down sits down and
     weeps HALVEY comes in and stands on one side

MR QUIRKE Hadnt I heartscalding enough before striving to rear five
weak children

MRS DELANE I suppose they will be sent to the Industrial Schools

MR QUIRKE My poor wife

follow my trade

MRS DELANE I hope they will not arrest her along with you

recommended to mercy

family through the bringing away of one sheep

HYACINTH He told me nothing

MR QUIRKE I suppose the whole town knows it so

HYACINTH No one knows it as yet

MR QUIRKE And the sergeant didnt see it

HYACINTH No one saw it or brought it away but myself

MR QUIRKE Where did you put it at all

HYACINTH In the ditch behind the church wall In among the nettles it
is Look at the way they have me stung Holds out hands

MR QUIRKE In the ditch The best hidingplace in the town

HYACINTH I never thought it would bring such great trouble upon you
You cant say anyway I did not tell you

MR QUIRKE You yourself that brought it away and that hid it I
suppose it was coming in the train you got information about the message
to the police

HYACINTH What now do you say to me

MR QUIRKE Say I say I am as glad to hear what you said as if it was
the Lord telling me Id be in heaven this minute

HYACINTH What are you going to do to me

MR QUIRKE Do is it Grasps his hand Any earthly thing you would
wish me to do I will do it

HYACINTH I suppose you will tell

MR QUIRKE The loss of the contract

HYACINTH Are my own wits gone astray

MR QUIRKE What way can I repay you

HYACINTH Shouting I tell you I took the sheep

MR QUIRKE You did God reward you

HYACINTH I stole away with it

MR QUIRKE The blessing of the poor on you

HYACINTH I put it out of sight

MRS DELANE Let you be quiet now Quirke Heres the sergeant coming to
search the shop

     SERGEANT comes in QUIRKE leaves go of HALVEY who arranges
     his hat etc

SERGEANT The department to blazes

MRS DELANE What is it is putting you out

SERGEANT To go to the train to meet the lecturer and there to get a
message through the guard that he was unavoidably detained in the South
holding an inquest on the remains of a drake

MRS DELANE The lecturer is it

SERGEANT To be sure What else would I be talking of The lecturer has
failed me and where am I to go looking for a person that I would think
fitting to take his place

MRS DELANE And thats all And you didnt get any message but the one

SERGEANT Is that all I am surprised at you Mrs Delane Isnt it
enough to upset a man within threequarters of an hour of the time of
the meeting Where I would ask you am I to find a man that has
education enough and wit enough and character enough to put up speaking
on the platform on the minute

MR QUIRKE Jumps up It is I myself will tell you that

SERGEANT You

MR QUIRKE Slapping HALVEY on the back Look at here Sergeant
There is not one word was said in all those papers about this young man
before you but it is true And there could be no good thing said of him
that would be too good for him

SERGEANT It might not be a bad idea

MR QUIRKE Whatever the paper said about him Sergeant I can say more
again It has come to my knowledgeby chancethat since he came to
this town that young man has saved a whole family from destruction

SERGEANT That is much to his credithelping the rural classes

MR QUIRKE A family and a long family big and little like sods of
turfand they depending on aon one that might be on his way to dark
trouble at this minute if it was not for his assistance Believe me he
is the most sensible man and the wittiest and the kindest and the
best helper of the poor that ever stood before you in this square Is
not that so Mrs Delane

MRS DELANE It is true indeed Where he gets his wisdom and his wit
and his information from I dont know unless it might be that he is
gifted from above

SERGEANT Well Mrs Delane I think we have settled that question Mr
Halvey you will be the speaker at the meeting The lecturer sent these
notesyou can lengthen them into a speech You can call to the people
of Cloon to stand out to begin the building of their character I saw a
lecturer do it one time at Dundrum Come up here he said Dare to be
a Daniel he said

HYACINTH I cantI wont

SERGEANT Looking at papers and thrusting them into his hand You
will find it quite easy I will conduct you to the platformthese
papers before you and a glass of waterthats settled Turns to go
Follow me on to the courthouse in half an hourI must go to the
barracks firstI heard there was a telegramCalls back as he goes
Dont be late Mrs Delane Mind Quirke you promised to come

MRS DELANE Well its time for me to make an end of settling
myselfand indeed Mr Quirke youd best do the same

MR QUIRKE Rubbing his cheek I suppose so I had best keep on good
terms with him for the present Turns Well now I had a great
escape this day

     Both go in as FARDY reappears whistling

HYACINTH Sitting down I dont know in the world what has come upon
the world that the half of the people of it should be cracked

FARDY Werent you found out yet

HYACINTH Found out is it I dont know what you mean by being found
out

FARDY Didnt he miss the sheep

HYACINTH He did and I told him it was I took itand what happened I
declare to goodness I dont knowWill you look at these Holds out
notes

FARDY Papers Are they more testimonials

HYACINTH They are what is worse Gives a hoarse laugh Will you
come and see me on the platformthese in my handand I
speakinggiving out advice FARDY whistles Why didnt you tell me
the time you advised me to steal a sheep that in this town it would
qualify a man to go preaching and the priest in the chair looking on

FARDY The time I took a few apples that had fallen off a stall they
did not ask me to hold a meeting They welted me well

HYACINTH Looking round I would take apples if I could see them I
wish I had broke my neck before I left Carrow and Id be better off I
wish I had got six months the time I was caught setting snaresI wish I
had robbed a church

FARDY Would a Protestant church do

HYACINTH I suppose it wouldnt be so great a sin

FARDY Its likely the sergeant would think worse of it Anyway if you
want to rob one its the Protestant church is the handiest

HYACINTH Getting up Show me what way to do it

FARDY Pointing I was going around it a few minutes ago to see
might there be eer a dog scenting the sheep and I noticed the window
being out

HYACINTH Out out and out

FARDY It was where they are putting colored glass in it for the
distiller

HYACINTH What good does that do me

FARDY Every good You could go in by that window if you had some person
to give you a hoist Whatever riches there is to get in it then youll
get them

HYACINTH I dont want riches Ill give you all I will find if you will
come and hoist me

FARDY Here is Miss Joyce coming to bring you to your lodging Sure I
brought your bag to it the time you were away with the sheep

HYACINTH Run Run

     They go off Enter MISS JOYCE

MISS JOYCE Are you here Mrs Delane Where can you tell me is Mr
Halvey

MRS DELANE Coming out dressed Its likely he is gone on to the
courthouse Did you hear he is to be in the chair and to make an
address to the meeting

MISS JOYCE He is getting on fast His reverence says he will be a good
help in the parish Who would think now there would be such a godly
young man in a little place like Carrow

     Enter SERGEANT in a hurry with telegram

SERGEANT What time did this telegram arrive Mrs Delane

MRS DELANE I couldnt be rightly sure Sergeant But sure its marked
on it unless the clock I have is gone wrong

SERGEANT It is marked on it And I have the time I got it marked on my
own watch

MRS DELANE Well now I wonder none of the police would have followed
you with it from the barracksand they with so little to do

SERGEANT Looking in at QUIRKES shop Well I am sorry to do what
I have to do but duty is duty

THE GAZING GLOBEF


     SCENE A soft creamcolored room bare walled and unfurnished
     except for dullblue grass mats on the floor and brilliant
     cushions In the centre of rear wall is a great circular window
     with a dais before it so that it may be used as a doorway A
     gathered shade of soft blue silk covers the opening of the window

PLACE An island in a southern sea

TIME Not so long ago

     The curtain rises on an empty stage ZAMA an old servant woman
     dressed in dull purples and grays hurries in from the right She
     stops at centre stage and glances about searchingly then calls in
     a weazen voice

ZAMA OhanoOhano Where do you be child

     Listens looks about sees drawn shade at the rear and sighs as
     she goes to it and starts to raise it

     As the shade rolls out of sight we see through the open window a
     bit of quaint cliff garden that overlooks a sea of green The rocks
     are higher on the left near the window where a purplepink vine
     in full blossom has started to climb At the right the rocks slope
     down to the sea At centre stone steps lead up to a slender stone
     pedestal that holds a gazing globe now a brilliant gold in the
     late afternoon sunlight OHANO with hands clasped round the
     globe is gazing at it She is a woman of the early twenties
     beautiful and gowned in a flowing kimonolike robe of green with
     embroideries of white and blue

ZAMA In a chiding motherly way Ohano my child you must not be
so much at that evil ball How many times be I not telling you it is an
enchanted ball

OHANO Yes Zama I hope it is enchanted Ive tried every other means
to gain the way to my hearts desireand theyve all failed me The
story these islanders have woven round this gazing globe may be but a
mythbut if it shows me the way to my freedom I shall not have looked
at it in vain

ZAMA Be you forgetting child tis said that evil ball shows only the
way to destruction

OHANO Yes these island people will create any myth go any length to
keep one thinking living in their narrow way You are destined for evil
if you try to follow the urge of your own heartoh yes I know

ZAMA But your heart child should only be wanting the love of Nijo

OHANO NijoI am hoping that he will be big enough to help mebut my
lover has been away so long

ZAMA But today he be coming backI came to tell you I think I saw his
boat

OHANO Nijos boat Where

ZAMA It be near the edge of the island just where

OHANO Why didnt you tell me before

ZAMA I came tobut I be forgetting when I see you at that evil ball
again

OHANO All eagerness Perhaps we can see him landfrom here on the
rockscome Zama I hear the sound of voices down near the seacome
They climb to the highest rock Look Zama the boat is there
Already there in the green water against the shore

ZAMA It do seem to be so Peers toward right

OHANO And thereis Nijo

ZAMA Where where child

OHANO Theresee hes just coming ashoreoh Nijo And look Zama
look what the people crowding round him have donelook

ZAMA What My poor eyes be yet uncertain What do they be doing to your
lover

OHANO They have put upon him the Robe of Flameto greet him with the
highest honor of the island

ZAMA So they be The robe they say the gods themselves did wear when
time did first begin Nijo must come back a great warrior nowa great
warrior

OHANO Oh how wonderful to return from the wars like that Zama I want
toI must go out into the world and do great things too like Nijo

ZAMA Nijo be coming back child That do be enough Look what is it
that glitters so in the sun

OHANO Why they are giving something to my red godsomething thats
long as a serpent moonsee he holds it out in admiration before him
Just what can it be

ZAMA In faith I do believe they have given your heroa sword

OHANO A marvellous swordlook its jewels flash with the shifting
lights warm as the colored rifts of sunset

ZAMA Such gems do be a tribute to his greatness Ohano they do

OHANO How gladly would I have the way I seek without such tributehow
willingly

ZAMA And now the crowd do be partinghe leaves the boat and he looks
this way Ohanohe looks

OHANO Nijo my red wonder of the world

ZAMA See he mounts his steedhe waves to you

OHANO Nijo Nijo

ZAMA And now he rides off to come to you here It is better we be
waiting inside for himwhen he brings back his love to his promised
bride

OHANO As they enter room Ah Zama he must bring me more than love
this timemuch more Yes your little Ohano must have more in her life
today than just loveand Nijo must show her the way to that realm
where she may stretch her soul and live

ZAMA The love of so great a man do be enough for any woman child

OHANO Oh nooh no

ZAMA But it do be and evil will fall I know if you do be asking more
than love

OHANO But I tell you Nijos love is not enough I must have a bigger
greater thing

ZAMA The gods do know of none that be more than love

OHANO But there must be else why would I feel the rush of its pulse
within my veins Why would my whole being cry out for action and the
glory of doing big things in the lands across the sea Why tell me why
I would feel those things if they were not so

ZAMA It be not for me to say child but I do be thinking you moon at
that evil ball too much It do make your sight grow red It be not wise
to know an enchanted thing so well

OHANO If that gazing globe in the garden would only show me the way to
my hearts desire how gladly would I be the victim of its enchantment

ZAMA Nijos kiss do be your enchantment child One touch of his lips
and you do be forgetting all else

OHANO If Nijos kiss can make me forget this fever within me I want
his kiss as I shall never want anything else in all of this life I want
it

     Approaching horses hoofs are heard from off right

ZAMA Listenthe horse Ohano your lover do be coming

OHANO Running to the window Already He must have taken the short
way through the cliffs

ZAMA Ah child do you not be excited as a bird in a stormwinds
blow

OHANO Superbly as she leans against window Yes I await my hero

ZAMA Hes stopped child He do be here At last he comes back to my
little Ohano

OHANO My hope comes With outstretched arms to right My Nijo

     She had impulsively started to greet NIJO but suddenly shrinks
     back

ZAMA What do be wrongwhat

OHANO Hes so differentso changedoh here he isssh

     NIJO appears at the window where he pauses for a moment He is a
     tall brunette man scarcely thirtya handsome wellknit southern
     island type wearing a flowing robe of flame with a flaring collar
     of oldgold brocade A peaked hat completes the costume A curved
     sword with a hilt thickly studded with large jewels and incased in
     gold hangs at his belt He seems worldly weary and sad as he
     advances into the room

OHANO Nijo

NIJO Unimpassioned Ohano

OHANO Eagerly You have come back

NIJO Yesand the season of the heat has been gracious to your health
I hope

OHANO Yesand yours Nijo

NIJO The same

NIJO Thank you

ZAMA Now I do be going for refreshments for your weariness great it
must be after so long a voyage Exits right

OHANO Shall we not sit here

NIJO As you will

     OHANO and NIJO sit upon mats near the window partly facing
     each other

OHANO Theythey gave you a sword at the boat

NIJO Wearily Oh yes

OHANO Even from up here we could see its jewels flash

NIJO Without interest Yes it is cunningly conceived

OHANO How wonderful it must be PerhapsI may see it

NIJO Still wearily If you so desire

     Unbuckles sword and holds it before himself for her to examine
     She leans over it admiringly touching the jewels as she speaks of
     them

OHANO Magnificent Rubies and emeralds and sapphires And here are
moonstones and diamonds How you must prize it

NIJO Wearily Of course one must

OHANO And the very people who tried to stop you from going across the
sea to win your glory have given it to you

NIJO That is the way of the world

OHANO Show me the way to glory Nijo

NIJO And why

OHANO I would travel it too

NIJO Youa simple island maiden

OHANO Im not simple Ive grown beyond the people here

NIJO But there is glory in the work women must do at home

OHANO And I have done my share of it I want bigger work nowout in
the world

NIJO But the simple tasks must be done

OHANO I am sick unto death of doing them

NIJO But you cant go into the battles of the world You are an island
woman

OHANO This last war has made all women free If the other island women
cling to the everlasting tradition that woman should not go beyond her
native hearth let them cling I shall reach the summit of things and
know the glory of doing big things in the world

NIJO But yousheltered protected all your lifehow can you do it

OHANO Thats what troubles me But you were fettered by this island
life and you broke through the bars of convention How did you do it

NIJO Sadly Ohano I would not spoil your life by telling you

OHANO Spoil it What do you think is happening to it now Oh Nijo
cant you understand Im stagnatingdying in this commonplace island
life

NIJO I thought that about myself too when I started my climb to
glory but scarcely a moon had passed before I realized the loneliness
of great heights

OHANO Tigerishly Are you trying to turn me from my wishto have
all the islands glory for yourself

NIJO No but only the valley people enjoy the sublimity of a mountain

OHANO Scornfully Ha

NIJO Those who reach the top have lost their perspective All they see
are the lonely tops of other mountains

OHANO Sublimely But theyve had the joy of the climb

NIJO And worth whatno more than the mist of the sea

OHANO Do you think that satisfies me I want to find out for myself I
only want you to tell me the way to use this spirit that boils within my
blood thirsts for action

NIJO That I never will

OHANO Oh what shall I do Ive even implored the sun and the moon
Looks toward sea Now I must listen to my dreamsmy dreams that
cry and cry Look in the gazing globe Look in the gazing globe It
will show you the way And if it ever does Ill take that path no
matter where it leads

NIJO My journey only made me want to come back to the haven of your
love Ohano The amber cup of glory left me athirst to be wrapped in the
mantle of your boundless love and warmed with the glow of your heart

OHANO Surprised Your journey has really led you back to me

NIJO Sadly Youre my only hope Ive been as mad for you as the
sea for the moonlight

OHANO Disturbed But you had fire and impulse when you went away
and nowwell you do still yearn for me

NIJO Quietly without passion The hope for your love has been the
light of my brain changing from life to dream from earth to star

OHANO My thirst for glory has been that way but Zama tells me it is as
nothing in the kiss of love If love has that power I am willing to
forget all else Kiss me Nijo

NIJO At last my lips will press yours as the sun flames to an immortal
moment when it meets the sky

     Kneeling opposite each other their lips meet OHANO instantly
     gives a piercing scream and recoils from him NIJO sinks into a
     heap

OHANO Rising and turning toward the sea weeping Oh oh oh

ZAMA Rushing in from right What is it What is it Ohano

OHANO Still weeping Ohooh

ZAMA What do it be my little Ohano

OHANO Turning His kissNijos kiss

ZAMA Yes

OHANO Cold as white marblecold

ZAMA Cold as white marble

OHANO Oh Nijo why do you kiss me like a thing of stone

NIJO As he looks up pitifully Into that kiss I tried to put all
the love Ive thought these many years

OHANO The love youve thought

NIJO Despondently Yes Ive only thought itthought it

OHANO But your heart

NIJO Rising My heart feels no more Only my head thinks

ZAMA You love no more

NIJO Only with my head it seems I see things know things understand
things but I no longer feel anything And my thirst for glory has done
it allkilled my love of life and turned my very kiss to stone Oh
glory why do men give the essence of their lives to youyou who last
no longer than the glow of gold above the place of sunset

OHANO Superbly Because glory gives you the worldeverything

NIJO It takes everything awaystrips youand leaves you nothing to
believe Oh I could have become a common soldier here marching
shoulder to shoulder with the island men going out to warbut noI
must be a great warrior a hero in position Had I known then what I
know now how gladly would I have gone as one of the thousands who are
known asjust soldiers They are the ones who know the throb of life
and love

OHANO You bring back such a message to me You who have climbed and
climbed to heights till I have believed you to be as constant in your
quest as the light that shines upon the gazing globe

NIJO Ia light

OHANO Why not Ive always likened your feet unto the disks of two
luminaries lighting the way for all the world to follow Looks at
gazing globe which is now a ball of gold against the black sea and
sky And now you tell me I was wrong Perhaps the light upon the
gazing globe itself is the only one to follow

NIJO Ia light Why Ohano if Im anything Im a gazing globe

OHANO What do you meanyou a gazing globe

NIJO That without Im all fair all wonderfulbut within Im empty as
a gazing globe

OHANO Scornfully But a gazing globe shows men the way to their
hearts desire

NIJO It reflects to men what they see into it So does glory

OHANO I cant believe thatnow

NIJO Behold what it has done to me Already as a child I gazed at that
globe longing to grasp the glory of which it was a symbol It filled me
with a red madness surged with an unbearable music giving me a riotous
pain Oh it made me drunk for the wine of glory

OHANO I know I know Now you talk as the man I thought you were

NIJO Im not a man Im dead

OHANO But you have known the glory of life Shall I never know the way
to it Appealingly to the globe The waythe way is what I seek

ZAMA Look not so upon the evil ball child It do be enchanted for one
thousand years OHANO moves nearer the globe Go not so near child
Evil will falland you will be enslaved

OHANO What care I if it shows me the way Hands outstretched to the
globe

ZAMA Appealingly to NIJO Sir I pray you do be stopping her She
do be always gazing at that golden ball and slowly it do be drawing her
within its enchanted grasp And it do be an enchanted ball

NIJO Perhaps theres more to its enchantment than I thought It claimed
me for a victimand now its freezing her lifes warmth to the
falseness of Orient pearl

OHANO Murmuring to the globe The waythe way I must have the
way

NIJO Swiftly drawing his sword I will not show youbut Ill save
you Starts toward the gazing globe

ZAMA Barring his path Nijo sir what do you be doing

NIJO With a flourish of his sword I kill the thing that freezes
another heart

ZAMA That do mean ruin It be an enchanted ball

NIJO Brushing past ZAMA It will enchant no longer

OHANO No No Nijo

NIJO Running up pedestal steps Yes

     With a mighty blow he strikes the gazing globe with his sword
     Frightened OHANO shrinks to one side facing right as a
     thunderlike crash follows the blow and pieces of the globe tumble
     to the groundall but one piece that remains upon the pedestal
     Then from a moon off stage right shines a straight golden path
     across the sea to the bit of gazing globe on the pedestal

OHANO Triumphantly The moonThe way At last the way From the
gazing globethe golden path to the moon of glory Now I am free

     Rushes wildly down the moonlight path to the sea

ZAMA Stop her

NIJO No it is better to let her go

ZAMA But the path do lead into the sea It is death Stop her
Starts forward

NIJO Restraining ZAMA No In death her soul has found the only
way

ANTON TCHEKOV

Anton Tchekov considered the foremost of contemporary Russian
dramatists was born in  at Taganrog Russia In  he was
graduated from the Medical School of the University of Moscow Ill
health soon compelled him to abandon his practice of medicine and in
 he sought the south In  the year of the successful appearance
of his Cherry Orchard he died in a village of the Black Forest in
Germany

As a dramatist Tchekov has with deliberate intent cast off much of the
conventionalities of dramatic technic In his longer plays especially
like The Sea Gull Uncle Vanya and Cherry Orchard he somewhat
avoids obvious struggles timeworn commonplaces wellprepared
climaxes and seeks rather to spread out a panoramic canvas for our
contemplation His chief aim is to show us humanity as he sees it It is
his interest in humanity that gives him so high rank as a dramatist

His oneact plays a form of drama unusually apt for certain intimate
aspects of Russian peasant life are more regular in their technic than
his longer plays Among the five or six shorter plays that Tchekov
wrote The Boor and A Marriage Proposal are his best In these plays
he shows the lighter side of Russian country life infusing some of the
spirit of the great Gogol into his broad and somewhat farcical character
portrayals With rare good grace in these plays he appears to be asking
us to throw aside our restraint and laugh with him at the stupidity and
navet as well as goodheartedness of the Russian people he knew so
well

The Boor is a remarkably wellconstructed oneact play and is
probably the finest oneact play of the Russian school of drama


PERSONS IN THE PLAY

     HELENA IVANOVNA POPOV a young widow mistress of a country estate
     GRIGORI STEPANOVITCH SMIRNOV proprietor of a country estate

     SCENE A wellfurnished receptionroom in MRS POPOVS home
     MRS POPOV is discovered in deep mourning sitting upon a sofa
     gazing steadfastly at a photograph LUKA is also present


LUKA It isnt right maam Youre wearing yourself out The maid and
the cook have gone looking for berries everything that breathes is
enjoying life even the cat knows how to be happyslips about the
courtyard and catches birdsbut you hide yourself here in the house as
though you were in a cloister Yes truly by actual reckoning you
havent left this house for a whole year

MRS POPOV And I shall never leave itwhy should I My life is over
He lies in his grave and I have buried myself within these four walls
We are both dead

LUKA There you are again Its too awful to listen to so it is
Nikolai Michailovitch is dead it was the will of the Lord and the Lord
has given him eternal peace You have grieved over it and that ought to
be enough Now its time to stop One cant weep and wear mourning
forever My wife died a few years ago I grieved for her I wept a whole
monthand then it was over Must one be forever singing lamentations
That would be more than your husband was worth He sighs You have
forgotten all your neighbors You dont go out and you receive no one
We liveyoull pardon melike the spiders and the good light of day
we never see All the livery is eaten by the miceas though there
werent any more nice people in the world But the whole neighborhood
is full of gentlefolk The regiment is stationed in
Riblovofficerssimply beautiful One cant see enough of them Every
Friday a ball and military music every day Oh my dear dear maam
young and pretty as you are if youd only let your spirits live
Beauty cant last forever When ten short years are over youll be glad
enough to go out a bit and meet the officersand then itll be too
late

MRS POPOV Resolutely Please dont speak of these things again
You know very well that since the death of Nikolai Michailovitch my life
is absolutely nothing to me You think I live but it only seems so Do
you understand Oh that his departed soul may see how I love him I
know its no secret to you he was often unjust toward me cruel
andhe wasnt faithful but I shall be faithful to the grave and prove
to him how I can love There in the Beyond hell find me the same as
I was until his death

LUKA What is the use of all these words when youd so much rather go
walking in the garden or order Tobby or Welikan harnessed to the trap
and visit the neighbors

MRS POPOV Weeping Oh

LUKA Madam dear madam what is it In Heavens name

MRS POPOV He loved Tobby so He always drove him to the Kortschagins
or the Vlassovs What a wonderful horseman he was How fine he looked
when he pulled at the reins with all his might Tobby Tobbygive him
an extra measure of oats today

LUKA Yes maam

     A bell rings loudly

MRS POPOV Shudders Whats that I am at home to no one

LUKA Yes maam He goes out centre

MRS POPOV Gazing at the photograph You shall see Nikolai how I
can love and forgive My love will die only with mewhen my poor heart
stops beating She smiles through her tears And arent you ashamed
I have been a good true wife I have imprisoned myself and I shall
remain true until death and youyouyoure not ashamed of yourself
my dear monster You quarrelled with me left me alone for weeks

     LUKA enters in great excitement

LUKA Oh maam some one is asking for you insists on seeing you

MRS POPOV You told him that since my husbands death I receive no one

LUKA I said so but he wont listen he says it is a pressing matter

MRS POPOV I receive no one

LUKA I told him that but hes a wild man he swore and pushed himself
into the room hes in the diningroom now

MRS POPOV Excitedly Good Show him in The impudent

     LUKA goes out centre

MRS POPOV What a bore people are What can they want with me Why do
they disturb my peace She sighs Yes it is clear I must enter a
convent Meditatively Yes a convent

     SMIRNOV enters followed by LUKA

SMIRNOV To LUKA Fool you make too much noise Youre an ass
Discovering MRS POPOVpolitely Madam I have the honor to
introduce myself Lieutenant in the Artillery retired country
gentleman Grigori Stepanovitch Smirnov Im compelled to bother you
about an exceedingly important matter

MRS POPOV Without offering her hand What is it you wish

SMIRNOV Your deceased husband with whom I had the honor to be
acquainted left me two notes amounting to about twelve hundred
roubles Inasmuch as I have to pay the interest tomorrow on a loan from
the Agrarian Bank I should like to request madam that you pay me the
money today

MRS POPOV Twelve hundredand for what was my husband indebted to you

SMIRNOV He bought oats from me

MRS POPOV With a sigh to LUKA Dont forget to give Tobby an
extra measure of oats

     LUKA goes out

MRS POPOV To SMIRNOV If Nikolai Michailovitch is indebted to you
I shall of course pay you but I am sorry I havent the money today
Tomorrow my manager will return from the city and I shall notify him to
pay you what is due you but until then I cannot satisfy your request
Furthermore today it is just seven months since the death of my
husband and I am not in a mood to discuss money matters

SMIRNOV And I am in the mood to fly up the chimney with my feet in the
air if I cant lay hands on that interest tomorrow Theyll seize my
estate

MRS POPOV Day after tomorrow you will receive the money

SMIRNOV I dont need the money day after tomorrow I need it today

MRS POPOV Im sorry I cant pay you today

SMIRNOV And I cant wait until day after tomorrow

MRS POPOV But what can I do if I havent it

SMIRNOV So you cant pay

MRS POPOV I cannot

SMIRNOV Hm Is that your last word

MRS POPOV My last

SMIRNOV Absolutely

MRS POPOV Absolutely

SMIRNOV Thank you He shrugs his shoulders And they expect me to
stand for all that The tollgatherer just now met me in the road and
asked me why I was always worrying Why in Heavens name shouldnt I
worry I need money I feel the knife at my throat Yesterday morning I
left my house in the early dawn and called on all my debtors If even
one of them had paid his debt I worked the skin off my fingers The
devil knows in what sort of Jewinn I slept in a room with a barrel of
brandy And now at last I come here seventy versts from home hope for
a little money and all you give me is moods Why shouldnt I worry

MRS POPOV I thought I made it plain to you that my manager will return
from town and then you will get your money

SMIRNOV I did not come to see the manager I came to see you What the
devilpardon the languagedo I care for your manager

MRS POPOV Really sir I am not used to such language or such manners
I shant listen to you any further She goes out left

SMIRNOV What can one say to that Moods Seven months since her husband
died Do I have to pay the interest or not I repeat the question have
I to pay the interest or not The husband is dead and all that the
manager isthe devil with himtravelling somewhere Now tell me
what am I to do Shall I run away from my creditors in a balloon Or
knock my head against a stone wall If I call on Grusdev he chooses to
be not at home Iroschevitch has simply hidden himself I have
quarrelled with Kurzin and came near throwing him out of the window
Masutov is ill and this woman hasmoods Not one of them will pay up
And all because Ive spoiled them because Im an old whiner dishrag
Im too tenderhearted with them But wait I allow nobody to play
tricks with me the devil with em all Ill stay here and not budge
until she pays Brr How angry I am how terribly angry I am Every
tendon is trembling with anger and I can hardly breathe Im even
growing ill He calls out Servant

     LUKA enters

LUKA What is it you wish

SMIRNOV Bring me Kvas or water LUKA goes out Well what can we
do She hasnt it on hand What sort of logic is that A fellow stands
with the knife at his throat he needs money he is on the point of
hanging himself and she wont pay because she isnt in the mood to
discuss money matters Womans logic Thats why I never liked to talk
to women and why I dislike doing it now I would rather sit on a powder
barrel than talk with a woman BrrIm getting cold as ice this
affair has made me so angry I need only to see such a romantic creature
from a distance to get so angry that I have cramps in the calves Its
enough to make one yell for help

looks at his clothes Ugh a fine figure No use denying that Dust
dirty boots unwashed uncombed straw on my vestthe lady probably

come into a receptionroom with such clothes Oh well no harm done
Im not here as a guest Im a creditor And there is no special costume
for creditors

LUKA Entering with glass You take great liberty sir

SMIRNOV Angrily What

LUKA III just

SMIRNOV Whom are you talking to Keep quiet

LUKA Angrily Nice mess This fellow wont leave He goes out

SMIRNOV Lord how angry I am Angry enough to throw mud at the whole
world I even feel ill Servant

     MRS POPOV comes in with downcast eyes

MRS POPOV Sir in my solitude I have become unaccustomed to the human
voice and I cannot stand the sound of loud talking I beg you please to
cease disturbing my rest

SMIRNOV Pay me my money and Ill leave

MRS POPOV I told you once plainly in your native tongue that I
havent the money at hand wait until day after tomorrow

SMIRNOV And I also had the honor of informing you in your native tongue
that I need the money not day after tomorrow but today If you dont
pay me today I shall have to hang myself tomorrow

MRS POPOV But what can I do if I havent the money

SMIRNOV So you are not going to pay immediately Youre not

MRS POPOV I cannot

SMIRNOV Then Ill sit here until I get the money He sits down You
will pay day after tomorrow Excellent Here I stay until day after
tomorrow Jumps up I ask you do I have to pay that interest
tomorrow or not Or do you think Im joking

MRS POPOV Sir I beg of you dont scream This is not a stable

SMIRNOV Im not talking about stables Im asking you whether I have to
pay that interest tomorrow or not

MRS POPOV You have no idea how to treat a lady

SMIRNOV Oh yes I have

MRS POPOV No you have not You are an illbred vulgar person
Respectable people dont speak so to ladies

SMIRNOV How remarkable How do you want one to speak to you In French
perhaps Madame je vous prie Pardon me for having disturbed you What
beautiful weather we are having today And how this mourning becomes
you He makes a low bow with mock ceremony

MRS POPOV Not at all funny I think it vulgar

SMIRNOV Imitating her Not at all funnyvulgar I dont understand
how to behave in the company of ladies Madam in the course of my life
I have seen more women than you have sparrows Three times have I fought
duels for women twelve I jilted and nine jilted me There was a time
when I played the fool used honeyed language bowed and scraped I
loved suffered sighed to the moon melted in loves torments I loved
passionately I loved to madness loved in every key chattered like a
magpie on emancipation sacrificed half my fortune in the tender
passion until now the devil knows Ive had enough of it Your obedient
servant will let you lead him around by the nose no more Enough Black
eyes passionate eyes coral lips dimples in cheeks moonlight
whispers soft modest sighsfor all that madam I wouldnt pay a
kopeck I am not speaking of present company but of women in general
from the tiniest to the greatest they are conceited hypocritical
chattering odious deceitful from top to toe vain petty cruel with a
maddening logic and he strikes his forehead in this respect please
excuse my frankness but one sparrow is worth ten of the aforementioned
petticoatphilosophers When one sees one of the romantic creatures
before him he imagines he is looking at some holy being so wonderful
that its one breath could dissolve him in a sea of a thousand charms and
delights but if one looks into the soulits nothing but a common
crocodile He seizes the armchair and breaks it in two But the
worst of all is that this crocodile imagines it is a masterpiece of
creation and that it has a monopoly on all the tender passions May the
devil hang me upside down if there is anything to love about a woman
When she is in love all she knows is how to complain and shed tears If
the man suffers and makes sacrifices she swings her train about and
tries to lead him by the nose You have the misfortune to be a woman
and naturally you know womans nature tell me on your honor have you
ever in your life seen a woman who was really true and faithful Never
Only the old and the deformed are true and faithful Its easier to find
a cat with horns or a white woodcock than a faithful woman

MRS POPOV But allow me to ask who is true and faithful in love The
man perhaps

SMIRNOV Yes indeed The man

MRS POPOV The man She laughs sarcastically The man true and
faithful in love Well that is something new Bitterly How can
you make such a statement Men true and faithful So long as we have
gone thus far I may as well say that of all the men I have known my
husband was the best I loved him passionately with all my soul as only
a young sensible woman may love I gave him my youth my happiness my
fortune my life I worshipped him like a heathen And what happened
This best of men betrayed me in every possible way After his death I
found his desk filled with loveletters While he was alive he left me
alone for monthsit is horrible even to think about ithe made love to
other women in my very presence he wasted my money and made fun of my
feelingsand in spite of everything I trusted him and was true to him
And more than that he is dead and I am still true to him I have buried
myself within these four walls and I shall wear this mourning to my
grave

SMIRNOV Laughing disrespectfully Mourning What on earth do you
take me for As if I didnt know why you wore this black domino and why
you buried yourself within these four walls Such a secret So romantic
Some knight will pass the castle gaze up at the windows and think to
himself Here dwells the mysterious Tamara who for love of her
husband has buried herself within four walls Oh I understand the
art

MRS POPOV Springing up What What do you mean by saying such
things to me

SMIRNOV You have buried yourself alive but meanwhile you have not
forgotten to powder your nose

MRS POPOV How dare you speak so

SMIRNOV Dont scream at me please Im not the manager Allow me to
call things by their right names I am not a woman and I am accustomed
to speak out what I think So please dont scream

MRS POPOV Im not screaming It is you who are screaming Please leave
me I beg of you

SMIRNOV Pay me my money and Ill leave

MRS POPOV I wont give you the money

SMIRNOV You wont You wont give me my money

MRS POPOV I dont care what you do You wont get a kopeck Leave me

SMIRNOV As I havent the pleasure of being either your husband or your
fianc please dont make a scene He sits down I cant stand it

MRS POPOV Breathing hard You are going to sit down

LUKA Puts his hand to his heart Good Lord He drops into a
chair Oh Im ill I cant breathe

MRS POPOV Where is Dascha Calling Dascha Pelageja Dascha
She rings

LUKA Theyre all gone Im ill Water

MRS POPOV To SMIRNOV Leave Get out

SMIRNOV Kindly be a little more polite

MRS POPOV Striking her fists and stamping her feet You are
vulgar Youre a boor A monster

SMIRNOV What did you say

MRS POPOV I said you were a boor a monster

SMIRNOV Steps toward her quickly Permit me to ask what right you
have to insult me

MRS POPOV What of it Do you think I am afraid of you

SMIRNOV And you think that because you are a romantic creature you can
insult me without being punished I challenge you

LUKA Merciful Heaven Water

SMIRNOV Well have a duel

MRS POPOV Do you think because you have big fists and a steers neck I
am afraid of you

SMIRNOV I allow no one to insult me and I make no exception because
you are a woman one of the weaker sex

MRS POPOV Trying to cry him down Boor boor boor

SMIRNOV It is high time to do away with the old superstition that it is
only the man who is forced to give satisfaction If there is equity at
all let there be equity in all things Theres a limit

MRS POPOV You wish to fight a duel Very well

SMIRNOV Immediately

MRS POPOV Immediately My husband had pistols Ill bring them She
hurries away then turns Oh what a pleasure it will be to put a
bullet in your impudent head The devil take you She goes out

SMIRNOV Ill shoot her down Im no fledgling no sentimental young
puppy For me there is no weaker sex

LUKA Oh sir Falls to his knees Have mercy on me an old man and
go away You have frightened me to death already and now you want to
fight a duel

SMIRNOV Paying no attention A duel Thats equity emancipation
That way the sexes are made equal Ill shoot her down as a matter of
principle What can a person say to such a woman Imitating her
The devil take you Ill put a bullet in your impudent head What can
one say to that She was angry her eyes blazed she accepted the
challenge On my honor its the first time in my life that I ever saw
such a woman

LUKA Oh sir Go away Go away

SMIRNOV That is a woman I can understand her A real woman No
shillyshallying but fire powder and noise It would be a pity to
shoot a woman like that

LUKA Weeping Oh sir go away

     Enter MRS POPOV

MRS POPOV Here are the pistols But before we have our duel please
show me how to shoot I have never had a pistol in my hand before

LUKA God be merciful and have pity upon us Ill go and get the
gardener and the coachman Why has this horror come to us He goes
out

SMIRNOV Looking at the pistols You see there are different kinds
There are special duelling pistols with cap and ball But these are
revolvers Smith  Wesson with ejectors fine pistols A pair like that
cost at least ninety roubles This is the way to hold a revolver
Aside Those eyes those eyes A real woman

MRS POPOV Like this

SMIRNOV Yes that way Then you pull the hammer backsothen you

approaches her hesitating Listen Are you still angry I was mad as

silent under his gaze No one He waits for her to speak She sits
with averted face He sinks into a dull misery The expression in his
eyes changes from beseeching to despair as her silence continues and he
cries out hoarsely No one Even if you kill a catwhats a cat
against a mans life

MRS BAUER Tensely her eyes fastened on his But you didnt kill

     A pause

MRS BAUER In a low appealing voice Did you Fritz Did you

     children who whisper together BAUER rises heavily to his feet
     and walks staggeringly toward the inner room

MRS BAUER In a worried tone as the pushes the children out Go on

     though to follow BAUER hesitates then crosses to the kitchen
     table and starts to clear up the dishes The report of a revolver
     sounds from the inner room Terrorstricken MRS BAUER rushes

rhythmical pantomimic drama It is a semipuppet play in which there
are dancing automatons to an accompaniment of rhythmic lines in place of
music Mr Kreymborg is a skilled musician and he composes his lines
with musical rhythm in mind His lines should be read accordingly




MANIKIN AND MINIKIN

A BISQUEPLAY


     Seen through an oval frame one of the walls of a parlor The
     wallpaper is a conventionalized pattern Only the shelf of the
     mantelpiece shows At each end seated on pedestals turned slightly
     away from one another two aristocratic bisque figures a boy in
     delicate cerise and a girl in cornflower blue Their shadows join
     in a grotesque silhouette In the centre an ancient clock whose
     tick acts as the metronome for the sound of their high voices
     Presently the mouths of the figures open and shut after the mode
     of ordinary conversation

SHE Manikin

HE Minikin

SHE That fool of a servant has done it again

HE I should say shes more than a fool

SHE A meddlesome busybody

HE With her stupid clumsy hands

SHE Her crooked monkey paws

HE And we wouldnt need putting back

SHE I with my back to you

HE I with my back to you

SHE Its been hours days weeks
by the sound of that everlasting clock
and the coming of day and the going of day
since I saw you last

HE Whats the use of the sun
with its butterfly wings of light
whats the use of a sun made to see by
if I cant see you

SHE Manikin

HE Minikin

SHE Say that again

SHE Oh Manikin

HE Minikin

SHE If you hadnt said that again my doubt would have filled a
balloon

HE Your doubtwhich doubt what doubt

SHE And although I cant move although I cant move unless somebody
shoves me one of these days when the sun isnt here I would have
slipped over the edge of this everlasting shelf

HE Minikin

SHE And fallen to that everlasting floor into so many fragments theyd
never paste Minikin together again

HE Minikin Minikin

SHE Theyd have to set another heresome Minikin Im assured

HE Why do you chatter so prattle so

SHE Because of my doubtbecause Im as positive as I am that I sit
here with my knees in a knotthat that human creatureloves you

HE Loves me

SHE And you her

HE Minikin

SHE When she takes us down she holds you much longer

HE Minikin

SHE Im sufficiently feminineand certainly old enoughI and my
hundred and seventy yearsI can see I can feel by her manner of
touching me and her flicking me with her mopthe creature hates
meshed like to drop me thats what she would

HE Minikin

SHE Dont you venture defending her Boobyyou dont know live women
When Im in the right position I can note how she fondles you pets you
like a parrot with her fingertip blows a pinch of dust from your eye
with her softest breath holds you off at arms length and fixes you
with her spider look actually holds you against her cheekher
rosetinted cheekbefore she releases you If she didnt turn us apart
so often I wouldnt charge her with insinuation but now I know she
loves youshes as jealous as I amand poor dead me in her live power
Manikin 

HE Minikin

SHE If you could see methe way you see her

HE But I see yousee you alwayssee only you

SHE If you could see me the way you see her youd still love me youd
love me the way you do her Who made me what I am Who dreamed me in
motionless clay

HE Minikin

SHE Manikin

HE Will you listen to me

SHE No

HE Will you listen to me

SHE No

HE Will you listen to me

SHE Yes

HE I love you

SHE No

HE Ive always loved you

SHE No

HE You doubt that

SHE Yes

HE You doubt that

SHE Yes

HE You doubt that

SHE No Youve always loved meyesbut you dont love me nownonot
since that roseface encountered your glanceno

HE Minikin

SHE If I could move about the way she can
if I had feet
dainty white feet which could twinkle and twirl
Id dance you so prettily
youd think me a sun butterfly
if I could let down my hair
and prove you its longer than larch hair
if I could raise my black brows
or shrug my narrow shoulders
like a queen or a countess
if I could turn my head tilt my head
this way and that like a swan
ogle my eyes like a peacock
till youd marvel
theyre green nay violet nay yellow nay gold
if I could move only move
just the moment of an inch
you would see what I could be
Its a change its a change
you men ask of women

HE A change

SHE Youre eyesick heartsick
of seeing the same foolish porcelain thing
a hundred years old
a hundred and fifty
and sixty and seventy
I dont know how old I am

HE Not an exhalation older than Inot an inhalation younger Minikin

SHE Manikin

HE Will you listen to me

SHE No

HE Will you listen to me

SHE No

HE Will you listen to me

SHE Yes

HE I dont love that creature

SHE You do

HE I cant love that creature

SHE You can

HE Will you listen to me

SHE Yes
if youll tell me
if youll prove me
so my last particle of dust
the tiniest speck of a molecule
the merest electron

HE Are you listening

SHE Yes

HE To begin with
I dislike suspect deplore
I had best say feel compassion
for what is called humanity
or the animate as opposed to the inanimate

SHE You say that so wisely
youre such a philosopher
say it again

HE That which is able to move
can never be steadfast you understand
Let us consider the creature at hand
to whom you have referred
with an undue excess of admiration
adulterated with an undue excess of envy

SHE Say that again

HE To begin with
I can only see part of her at once
She moves into my vision
she moves out of my vision
she is doomed to be wayward

SHE Yes but that which you see of her

HE Is ugly commonplace unsightly
Her face a roseface
Its veined with blood and the skin of it wrinkles
her eyes are ever so near to a hens
her movements
if one would pay such a gait with regard
her gait is unspeakably ungainly
her hair

SHE Her hair

HE Luckily Ive never seen it down
I dare say it comes down in the dark
when it looks most assuredly like tangled weeds

SHE Again Manikin that dulcet phrase

HE Even were she beautiful
she were never so beautiful as thou

SHE Now youre a poet Manikin

HE Even were she so beautiful as thoulending her your eyes and the
exquisite head which holds themlike a cup two last beads of wine like
a stone two last drops of rain green nay violet nay yellow nay
gold

SHE Faster Manikin

HE I cant Minikin
Words were never given to man
to phrase such a one as you are
inanimate symbols
can never embrace embody hold
the animate dream that you are
I must cease

SHE Manikin

HE And even were she so beautiful as thou
she couldnt stay beautiful

SHE Stay beautiful

HE Humans change with each going moment
That is a grayhaired platitude
Just as I can see that creature
only when she touches my vision
so I could only see her once were she beautiful
at best twice or thrice
youre more precious than when you came

SHE And you

HE Human pathos penetrates still deeper
when one determines their inner life
as weve pondered their outer
Their inner changes far more desperately

SHE How so wise Manikin

HE They have what philosophy terms moods
and moods are more pervious to modulation
than pools to idle breezes
These people may say to begin with
I love you
This may be true Im assured
as true as when we say I love you
But they can only say
I love you
so long as the mood breathes
so long as the breezes blow
so long as water remains wet
They are honest
they mean what they say
passionately tenaciously tragically
but when the mood languishes
they have to say
if it be they are honest
I do not love you
Or they have to say
I love you
to somebody else

SHE To somebody else

HE Now you and I
weve said that to each other
weve had to say it
for a hundred and seventy years
and well have to say it always

SHE Say always again

HE The life of an animate

SHE Say always again

HE Always
The life of an animate
is a procession of deaths
with but a secret sorrowing candle
guttering lower and lower
on the path to the grave
the life of an inanimate
is as serenely enduring
as all still things are

SHE Still things

HE Recall our childhood in the English museum
ere we were moved
from place to place
to this dreadful Yankee salon
do you remember
that little old Greek tanagra
of the girl with a head like a bud
that little old Roman medallion
of the girl with a head like a

SHE Manikin Manikin
were they so beautiful as I
did you love them too
why do you bring them back

HE They were not so beautiful as thou
I spoke of them
recalled designated them
well because they were ages old
andand

SHE Andand

HE And we might live as long as they
as they did and do
I hinted their existence
because theyre not so beautiful as thou
so that by contrast and deduction

SHE And deduction

HE You know what Id say

SHE But say it again

HE I love you

SHE Manikin

HE Minikin

SHE Then even though that creature has turned us
apart
can you see me

HE I can see you

SHE Even though you havent seen me
for hours days weeks
with your dear blue eyes
you can see me
with your hidden ones

HE I can see you

SHE Even though you are still
and calm and smooth
and lovely outside
you arent still and calm
and smooth and lovely inside

HE Lovely yesbut not still and calm and smooth

SHE Which way are you looking What do you see

HE I look at you I see you

SHE And if that fool of a servantoh Manikinsuppose she should
break the futureour great happy centuries aheadby dropping me
throwing me down

HE I should take an immediate step off this everlasting shelf

SHE But you cannot move

HE The good wind would give me a blow

SHE Now youre a punster And what would your fragments do

HE They would do what Manikin did

SHE Say that again

HE Theyd do what Manikin did

SHE Manikin

HE Minikin

SHE Shall I tell you something

HE Tell me something

SHE Are you listening

HE With my inner ears

SHE I wasnt jealous of that woman

HE You werent jealous

SHE I wanted to hear you talk

HE You wanted to hear me talk

SHE You talk so wonderfully

HE Do I indeed What a booby I am

SHE And I wanted to hear you say

HE You cheat you idler you

SHE Woman

HE Dissembler

SHE Manikin

HE Minikin

SHE Everlastingly

HE Everlastingly

SHE Say it again

HE I refuse

SHE You refuse

HE Well

SHE Well

HE You have ears outside your headIll say that for youbut theyll
never hearwhat your other ears hear

SHE Say itdown one of the earsoutside my head

HE I refuse

SHE You refuse

HE Leave me alone

SHE Manikin

HE I cant say it

Carolina He has received his education at Buies Creek Academy and at
the University of North Carolina from which he received his bachelors
degree in  He saw service with the A E F in France with the

forthcoming volume of Carolina FolkPlays published by Henry Holt 
Company The Miser The Old Man of Edenton The Lords Will
Wreck Pint Granny Boling in The Drama for AugustSeptember
 The first three plays named above were produced originally by the
Carolina Playmakers at Chapel Hill

White Dresses is an excellent example of folkplay of North Carolina
This play was written in English  the course in dramatic composition
at the University of North Carolina conducted by Professor Frederick H
Koch The Aim of the Carolina Playmakers says Professor Koch is to
build up a genuinely native drama a fresh expression of the folklife
in North Carolina drawn from the rich background of local tradition and
from the vigorous new life of the present day In these simple plays we
hope to contribute something of lasting value in the making of a new
folktheatre and a new folkliterature

Out of the many conflicts of American life past and present Mr Greene
sees possibilities for a great native drama White Dresses presents a
fundamental aspect of the race problem in America

    MARY MCLEAN a quadroon girl niece of CANDACE
    JIM MATTHEWS Marys lover
    HENRY MORGAN the landlord a white man




WHITE DRESSES

     TIME The evening before Christmas 

     SCENE The scene is laid in a negro cabin the home of CANDACE
     and MARY MCLEAN in eastern North Carolina

     In the right corner of the room is a rough bed covered with a
     ragged counterpane In the centre at the rear is an old bureau with
     a cracked mirror to the left of it a door opening to the outside
     In the left wall is a window with red curtains A large chest
     stands near the front on this side and above it hang the family
     clothes several ragged dresses an old bonnet and a cape At the
     right toward the front is a fireplace in which a small fire is
     burning Above and at the sides of the fireplace hang several pots
     and pans neatly arranged Above these is a mantel covered with a
     lambrequin of dingy red crape paper On the mantel are bottles and
     a clock A picture of Daniel in the Lions Den hangs above the
     mantel The walls are covered with newspapers to which are pinned
     several illustrations clipped from popular magazines A rough table
     is in the centre of the room A lamp without a chimney is on it
     Several chairs are about the room A rockingchair with a rag
     pillow in it stands near the fire There is an air of cleanliness
     and poverty about the whole room

     The rising of the curtain discloses the empty room The fire is
     burning dimly AUNT CANDACE enters at the rear carrying several
     sticks of firewood under one arm She walks with a stick and is
     bent with rheumatism She is dressed in a slat bonnet which hides
     her face in its shadow brogan shoes a mans ragged coat a
     checkered apron a darkcolored dress She mumbles to herself and
     shakes her head as she comes in With great difficulty she puts the
     wood on the fire and then takes the poker and examines some
     potatoes that are cooking in the ashes She takes out her snuffbox
     and puts snuff in her lip As she does this her bonnet is pushed
     back and in the firelight her features are discerniblesunken
     eyes high cheekbones and big flat nose Upon her forehead she
     wears a pair of steelrimmed spectacles

     She sits down in a rockingchair now and then putting her hand to
     her head and groaning as if in pain She turns and looks
     expectantly toward the door After a moment she hobbles to the
     chest on the right and takes out an old red crocheted fascinator
     Shivering she wraps it around her neck and stands looking down in
     the chest She lifts out a little black box and starts to unfasten
     it when the door suddenly opens and MARY MCLEAN comes in AUNT
     CANDACE puts the box hastily back into the chest and hurries to
     the fire

     MARY MCLEAN has a turn of collards in one arm and a paper bundle
     in the other She lays the collards on the floor near the window
     and puts her shawl on the bed She is a quadroon girl about
     eighteen years old with an oval face and a mass of fine dark hair
     neatly done up There is something in her bearing that suggests a
     sort of refinement Her dress is pitifully shabby her shoes
     ragged But even this cannot hide the lines of an almost perfect
     figure For a negro she is pretty As she comes up to the fire her
     pinched lips and the tired expression on her face are plainly
     visible Only her eyes betray any signs of excitement

AUNT CANDACE Honey Is been awaitin foh you de las two hours My
haids been bad off Chile whah you been Miss Mawgin must a had a
powful washin up at de big house

     MARY opens her hand and shows her a fivedollar bill

AUNT CANDACE De Lawd help my life chile

MARY An look here what Mr Henry sent you too She undoes the
bundle revealing several cooked sweet potatoes sausages spareribs
and some boiled ham He said as twas Christmas time he sent you this
with the collards there

     She points toward the collards at the window AUNT CANDACE pays
     little attention to the food as MARY places it in her lap but
     continues to look straight into MARYS face The girl starts to
     give her the money but she pushes her away

AUNT CANDACE Excitedly Whahd you git dat honey Whahd you git

     her bonnet and hangs it behind her on the rockingchair Then she
     begins to eat greedily now and then licking the grease off her
     fingers Suddenly she utters a low scream putting her hands to her
     head and rocking to and fro She grasps her stick and begins
     beating about her as if striking at something crying out in a loud
     voice

AUNT CANDACE Ahhah Ill git you Ill git you

MARY Its your poor head aint it aunty You rest easy Ill take

     out

     JIM at a loss as to the meaning of MARYS tears but feeling
     that they are somehow a further proof of his power with the ladies
     smiles knowingly tunes his guitar and begins strumming a chord
     After playing a few bars he starts singing in a clear voice with
     Ohs and Ahs thrown in

     playing and speaks softly

JIM Miss Mary Is sho sorry I made you cry Honey I dont want you

     She remains silent He smiles in selfgratulation but utters a
     mournful sigh for her benefit Pulling his guitar further up on his
     lap he takes out his pocketknife fits it between his fingers in
     imitation of the Hawaiians clears his throat and strikes another
     chord


AUNT CANDACE Noticing the silence looks at MARY Whats de trouble

across her forehead

     AUNT CANDACE begins swaying rhythmically with the music clapping
     her hands and now and then exclaiming

AUNT CANDACE Jesus Lawdy my Lawd

     She and JIM begin to sing alternately she the first verse and
     JIM the refrain While this is going on MARY unobserved goes
     to the window pulls open the curtain and looks out stretching her
     clenched hands above her head She turns to the mirror smooths
     back her heavy hair shakes her head snatches off the ribbon and
     throws it on the floor Then she pulls off her cloak and lays it on
     the bed She picks up the ribbon and puts it in the bureau

JIM Lawd I know my time aint long

     They repeat these lines

AUNT CANDACE Gwine roll em up lak leaves in de judgment

JIM Lawd I know my time aint long

     After these lines have been repeated JIM noticing MARYS
     absence from his side stops and looks around AUNT CANDACE
     keeps on singing a verse or two She stops and looks around seas
     MARY standing in an attitude of despair JIM speaks

JIM Miss Mary

AUNT CANDACE What is it honey

     There is a stamping of feet outside MARY raises her head with
     an expectant look an her face She runs to the door and opens it
     Her expression changes to one of disappointment and fear as HENRY
     MORGAN enters He is a man of powerful build about fifty years
     old rough and overbearing A weeks growth of grizzled beard
     darkens his face He wears a felt hat long black overcoat ripped
     at the pockets and buttoned up to his chin big laced boots and
     yarn mittens In his hand he carries a package which he throws
     contemptuously on the bed He keeps his hat on MARY closes the
     door and stands with her back to it clasping the latchstring
     AUNT CANDACE and JIM offer their seats JIMS look is one of
     servile respect that of Aunt Candace one of troubled expectancy

MORGAN In a booming voice Dad burn you Jim Still acourtin eh

     her stick MORGAN sees MARY looking at the package

MORGAN Thats for Mary I was comin down this way an caught up with

and then glancing around to see if any one is watching her She is
oblivious of the conversation MARY stands with bowed head Well

MARY I couldnt do it Itd kill her to leave here You know it Shes

     AUNT CANDACE stealthily slips across the room and picks up the
     package from the bed unseen by any one but JIM

MORGAN Cant do it Well what you want me to do Lose money on you
till the end of time You aint earned enough to keep you in clothes for
the last three years since Candace got down an 

     A terrible cry rings out AUNT CANDACE stands by the bed
     holding a white dress up before her MORGAN looks perplexed
     Suddenly he starts back in astonishment

MARY Starting forward Its for me Joyously Its mine

MORGAN Catching MARY by the arm Whatwhat is it Heigh

     He pulls her back AUNT CANDACE looks at MORGAN Gradually he
     lowers his head

MORGAN Mary put them damned things up Put em up I say He goes
toward her She shrinks back holding the dress to her He snatches it
from her and throws it on the bed then he pushes her out in the middle
of the floor She wipes the tears from her eyes with her apron You

JIM Coming up to MARY Miss Mary dont look lak dat Is gwine do

foodI cant drink liquorI find people either malicious or dullI
see by the fate of my acquaintances both men and women that love is a
farce I have seen fame and preference come to those who least deserved
them while the whole world kicked and cuffed the worthy ones The
craftier schemer gets the most money and glory while the fairminded
dealer is humiliated in the bankruptcy court In the name of the law
every crime is committed in the name of religion every vice is
indulged in the name of education greatest ignorance is rampant

LUKE I dont git all of that but I reckon youre some put out

LUKE Taint that bad is it

REVENUE Worse Twenty times Ive had a revolver to my headcrazy to
dieand then as my finger pressed the trigger Id get a terrible
dreada dread that I was plunging into worse terrors than this world
ever knew If killing were the end it would be easy but what if its
only the beginning of something worse

LUKE Well you gotta take some chances

REVENUE Ill not take that one You know Mr Luke life was given to
us by some one who probably never intended that we should take it and
that some one has something ready for people who destroy his property
Thats what frightens me

LUKE You do too much worryin to be a regular suicide

REVENUE Yes I do Thats why I changed my plan

LUKE What plan

REVENUE My plan for dying

LUKE Oh then you didnt give up the idea

REVENUE No indeedIm still determined to die but Im going to make
some one else responsible

LUKE Ohso you haint willing to pay fer yer own funeral music

REVENUE No sir Ill furnish the passenger but some one else must buy
the ticket You see when I finally decided Id be killed I immediately
exposed myself to every danger I knew

LUKE How

REVENUE In a thousand ways Pause Did you ever see an
automobile

LUKE No

REVENUE They go faster than steam engines and they dont stay on
tracks Did you ever hear of Fifth Avenue New York

LUKE No

REVENUE Fifth Avenue is jammed with automobiles eight deep all day
long People being killed every day I crossed Fifth Avenue a thousand
times a day every day for weeks never once trying to get out of the
way and always praying Id be hit

LUKE And couldnt yu git hit

REVENUE In disgust No Automobiles only hit people who try to get
out of the way Pause When that failed I frequented the lowest
dives on the Bowery flashing a roll of money and wearing diamonds
hoping theyd kill me for them They stole the money and diamonds but
never touched me

LUKE Couldnt you pick a fight

REVENUE Im coming to that You know up North they believe that a man
can be killed in the South for calling another man a liar

LUKE Thats right

REVENUE It is is it Well Ive called men liars from Washington to
Atlanta and Im here to tell you about it

LUKE They must a took pity on ye

REVENUE Do you know Two Gun Jake that keeps the dive down in Henderson

LUKE I should think I do Jakes killed enough of em

REVENUE Hes a bad man aint he

LUKE Hes no trifler

REVENUE I wound up in Jakes place two nights ago pretending to be
drunk Jake was cursing niggers

LUKE Hes allus doin that

REVENUE So I elbowed my way up to the bar and announced that I was an
expert in the discovery of nigger blood  could tell a nigger who was
ths white

LUKE Ye kin

REVENUE No I cant but I made them believe it I then offered to look
them over and tell them if they had any nigger blood in them A few of
them sneaked away but the rest stood for it I passed them all until I
got to Two Gun Jake I examined his eyeballs looked at his
fingernails and said Youre a nigger

LUKE An what did Jake do

REVENUE He turned pale took me into the back room He said Honest to
God mister can ye see nigger blood in me I said Yes Theres no
mistake about it Not a bit I answered Good God he said I
always suspected it Then he pulled out his gun

LUKE Eh  eh

REVENUE And shot himself

LUKE Jake shot hisself Is he dead

REVENUE I dont knowI was too disgusted to wait I wandered around
until I thought of you moonshiners  scrambled around in the mountains
until I found your still I sat on it and waited until you boys showed
up and here I am and youre going to kill me

LUKE Pause Ah so ye want us to do yer killin fer ye do ye

REVENUE Youre my last hope If I fail this time I may as well give it
up

LUKE Takes out revolver turns sidewise and secretly removes
cartridges from chamber Rises What wuz that noise

     Lays revolver on table and steps outside of door REVENUE looks
     at revolver apparently without interest

     LUKE cautiously enters doorway and expresses surprise at seeing
     REVENUE making no attempt to secure revolver Feigning excitement
     goes to table picks up gun

LUKE I reckon Im gettin careless leavin a gun layin around here

LUKE I aint got no call to do your killin fer you If ye haint sport
enough to do it yerself I reckon ye kin go on sufferin

REVENUE But I told you why I dont want to do it One murder more or
less means nothing to you You dont care anything about the hereafter

LUKE Mebbe I dont but there aint no use my takin any more chances
than I have to And whats more mister from what you been tellin me I

MODESTY


     TIME The present

     SCENE A drawingroom Entrance C sofa chairs writingdesk
     JACQUES and HENRIETTE enter C from dinner HENRIETTE in
     ball costume JACQUES in evening dress They come down C

HENRIETTE What is it Is it so terribly embarrassing

JACQUES You can easily guess

HENRIETTE Youre so longwinded You make me wearycome to the point

JACQUES Ill risk all at a strokeMy dear Henriette we are cousins I
am unmarried youa widow Will youwill you be my wife

HENRIETTE Oh my dear Jacques what are you thinking of We were such
good friends And now youre going to be angry

JACQUES Why

HENRIETTE Because Im not going to give you the sort of answer youd
like

JACQUES You dontyou dont think Id make a good husband

HENRIETTE Frankly no

JACQUES I dont please you

HENRIETTE As a cousin you are charming as a husband you would be quite
impossible

JACQUES What have you against me

HENRIETTE Nothing that youre to blame for It is merely the fault of
my character that forces me to refuse you

JACQUES But I cant see why you

HENRIETTE With an air of great importance A great change is taking
place in the hearts of us women We have resolved henceforward not to be
treated as dolls but as creatures of reason As for me I am most
unfortunate for nobody ever did anything but flatter me I have always
been too selfsatisfied too

JACQUES You have always been the most charming of women the most

HENRIETTE Stop Its exactly that sort of exaggeration thats begun to
make me so unsure of myself I want you to understand once for all
Jacques I have a conscience and furthermore it is beginning to
develop I have taken some important resolutions

JACQUES What do you mean

HENRIETTE I have resolved to better myself to raise my moral and
intellectual standards and to do that I must be guided criticised

JACQUES But you already possess every imaginable quality You are
charitable cultured refined

HENRIETTE Annoyed Please

     Turns away and sits on settee JACQUES addresses her from
     behind chair

JACQUES You are discreet witty

HENRIETTE The same old compliments Everybody tells me that I want to
be preached to contradicted scolded

JACQUES You could never stand that

HENRIETTE Yes I could I should be happy to profit by the criticism
It would inspire me

JACQUES Id like to see the man who has the audacity to criticise you
to your face

HENRIETTE That is enough I trust you are aware that you are not the
person fit to exercise this influence over me

JACQUES How could I Everything about you pleases me It can never be
otherwise

HENRIETTE How interesting Thats the very reason I rejected your
proposal I shant marry until I am certain that I shall not be
continually pestered with compliments and flattery and submission The
man who marries me shall make it his business to remind me of my
shortcomings to correct all my mistakes He must give me the assurance
that I am continually bettering myself

JACQUES And thishusbandhave you found him already

HENRIETTE What Oh who knows

JACQUES Perhaps itsAlbert

HENRIETTE Perhaps it iswhat of it

JACQUES Really

HENRIETTE You want me to speak frankly

JACQUES Of course

HENRIETTE Thenyou wouldnt be annoyed if I said something nice about
Albert

     JACQUES brings down C chair which is by desk facing
     HENRIETTE

JACQUES Why hes your friend

HENRIETTE Oh So you too have a good opinion of him

JACQUES Certainly

HENRIETTE Well what would you say of him

JACQUES Trying to be fair Id trust him with moneyIve never
heard he was a thief

HENRIETTE But in other ways

JACQUES Still conscientious I believe him to be
somewhatsomewhat

HENRIETTE Wilful Headstrong

JACQUES Umuncultured let us say

HENRIETTE As you likebut for my part I find that that air of his
inspires absolute confidence He knows how to be severe at times

JACQUES Youre mistaken about that thats only simple brute force Go
to the Zoo the ostrich the boa constrictor the rhinoceros all
produce the same effect on you as your Albert

HENRIETTE My Albert My Albert Oh I dont appropriate him so quickly
as all that His qualifications as censor are not yet entirely
demonstrated

     JACQUES rises and approaches HENRIETTE who maintains an air of
     cold dignity

JACQUES For heavens sake Henriette stop this nonsense

HENRIETTE What nonsense

JACQUES Tell me you are only playing with me That you only wanted to
put my love to the test To make me jealous To torture me You have
succeeded Stop it for heavens sake

HENRIETTE My dear friend Im very sorry for you I wish I could help
you but I cannot I have given you a perfect description of the husband
I want and I am heartbroken that you bear so remote a resemblance to
him

JACQUES Only promise you will think over your decision

HENRIETTE It is better to stop right now

JACQUES Dont send me away like this Dont

HENRIETTE I might give you false hopes I have only to tell you that I
shall never consent to be the wife of a man who cannot be the severest
of censors

JACQUES Kneeling I beg you

HENRIETTE No no no Jacques Spare me that A telephone rings in
the next room Theres the phone

JACQUES Dont go

     HENRIETTE rises hastily and goes to door JACQUES tries for a
     moment to stop her

HENRIETTE I must go Go away I tell you Ill be furious if I find you
here when I come back

JACQUES Henriette

HENRIETTE Coming down L to table Not now Please Jacques
Exit

JACQUES I cant leave it that way I am the husband who will make her
happy But how That is the question Pause Ah Albert

     Enter ALBERT He shakes hands with JACQUES

ALBERT How are you rival

JACQUES Gravely My friend we are no longer rivals

ALBERT Hows that

JACQUES I have just had a talk with Henriette she refuses to marry
either one of us

ALBERT Did she mention me

JACQUES Casually

     Both sit down ALBERT on sofa JACQUES on chair near it

ALBERT What did she say

JACQUES Oh I wouldnt repeat it it wouldnt be friendly

ALBERT I must know

JACQUES Very well thenshe said that you had not succeedednor had
Ito find the way to her heart Between you and me weve got a
highminded woman to deal with a philosopher who detests flattery It
seems you have been in the habit of paying her compliments

ALBERT I never pay compliments

JACQUES Whatever you did she didnt like it Moreoversince you want
the whole truthyou seem to her a bitridiculous

ALBERT Pardon

JACQUES The very word ridiculous She wants a husband who will act as
a sort of conscience pilot Evidently you havent appealed to her in
that capacity

ALBERT Sometimes I used to be rather sharp with her

JACQUES You did it too daintily perhaps you lacked severity Ill
wager you smiled instead of scowledthat would have been fatal

ALBERT I dont understand

JACQUES Henriette is a singular woman to get her you have to tell her
that you dont like herher pride demands it Tell her all her bad
qualities straight from the shoulder

ALBERT Feeling himself equal to the task Dont worry about that
Rises and walks about I know women love to be told things straight
out

JACQUES Im not the man for that nor are you I suppose

ALBERT No Jacques Im awfully obliged to you youve done me a good
turn

JACQUES Dont mention it

ALBERT You want to do me one more favor

JACQUES Devotedly Anything you like

ALBERT Promise me youll never let Henrietta know that you told me
this

JACQUES I promise but why

ALBERT You know she has to understand that my behavior toward her is in
character Natural you see

JACQUES Oh youre going at it strenuously

ALBERT I am

JACQUES Your decision honors you

ALBERT Lets not have Henriette find us together Would you mind
disappearing

JACQUES With pleasure Ill look in later and get the news

     JACQUES rises

ALBERT Thanks Jacques

JACQUES Goodby Albert

     Exits after shaking hands cordially with ALBERT

HENRIETTE Reentering as ALBERT assumes a rather severe attitude
How are you Pause Have you seen Jacques

ALBERT With a determined air No Henriette Thank God

HENRIETTE Why

ALBERT Because it pains me to see men in your presence whom you care
nothing for

HENRIETTE Delighted You dont like that

     Sitting down on sofa

ALBERT No I dont And Id like to tell you

HENRIETTE About my relations with Jacques

ALBERT Oh hes not the only one

HENRIETTE Heaps of others I suppose

ALBERT Sits on chair near sofa You suppose correctly heaps

HENRIETTE Really

ALBERT You are a coquette

HENRIETTE You think so

ALBERT I am positive

HENRIETTE I suppose I displease you in other ways too

ALBERT In a great many other ways

HENRIETTE Really delighted How confidently you say that

ALBERT So much the worse if you dont like it

HENRIETTE Quite the contrary my dear Albert you cant imagine how you
please me when you talk like that Its perfectly adorable

ALBERT It makes very little difference to me whether I please you or
not I speak according to my temperament Perhaps it is a bit
authoritative but I cant help that

HENRIETTE You are superb

ALBERT Oh no Im just myself

HENRIETTE Oh if you were only the

ALBERT I havent the slightest idea what you were about to say but
Ill guarantee that theres not a more inflexible temper than mine in
Paris

HENRIETTE I can easily believe it Pause Now tell me in what way
you think Im coquettish

     Sitting on edge of sofa in an interested attitude ALBERT takes
     out cigarette lights and smokes it

ALBERT Thats easy for instance when you go to the theatre to a
reception to the races As soon as you arrive the men flock about in
dozens those who dont know you come to be introduced Youre the
talkingstock of society Now I should be greatly obliged if you would
tell me to what you attribute this notoriety

HENRIETTE Modestly Well I should attribute it to the fact that I
amagreeable and pleasant

ALBERT There are many women no less so

HENRIETTE Summoning up all her modesty to reply You force me to
recognize the fact

ALBERT And I know many women fully as pleasant as you who dont flaunt
their favors in the face of everybody they preserve some semblance of
dignity a certain air of aloof distinction that it would do you no harm
to acquire

HENRIETTE With a gratitude that is conscious of its bounds Thanks
thanks so much Drawing back to a corner of the sofa I am deeply
obliged to you

ALBERT Not at all

HENRIETTE In the future I shall try to behave more decorously

ALBERT Another thing

HENRIETTE The first signs of impatience begin to appear What
Another thing to criticise

ALBERT A thousand Settling himself comfortably

HENRIETTE Well hurry up

ALBERT You must rid yourself of your excessive and ridiculous
schoolgirl sentimentality

HENRIETTE I wonder just on what you base your statement Would you
oblige me so far as to explain that

ALBERT With pleasure I remember one day in the country you were in
tears because a poor little mouse had fallen into the claws of a
wretched cat two minutes later you were sobbing because the poor
cat choked in swallowing the wretched little mouse

HENRIETTE That was only my kindness to dumb animals Is it wrong to be
kind to dumb animals

     She is about to rise when ALBERT stops her with a gesture

ALBERT That would be of no consequence if it werent that you were of
so contradictory a nature that you engage in the emptiest most
frivolous conversations the most

HENRIETTE Slightly disdainful Ah you are going too far You make
me doubt your power of analysis I am interested only in noble and high
things

ALBERT And yet as soon as the conversation takes a serious turn its
appalling to see you you yawn and look bored to extinction

HENRIETTE There you are rightpartly

ALBERT You see

HENRIETTE Sharp and even antagonistic Yes I have that unfortunate
gift of understanding things before people have finished explaining
them While the others are waiting for the explanation I cant wait
and I fly on miles ahead

ALBERT Hmthat sounds probable I shant say anything more about that
just now But while Im on the subject I have more than once noticed
that you are guilty of the worst vice woman ever possessed

HENRIETTE And what if you please

ALBERT Vanity

HENRIETTE I vain Oh youre going too far

ALBERT Unruffled Not a word Every time I tell you a fault you
twist it round to your own advantage Whereas you are really worse

HENRIETTE Rising and gathering her skirts about her with virtuous
indignation You are rude I suppose you would find fault with me if I
considered myself more polite than the person whom I have the honor to
address

ALBERT I hope you dont intend that remark as personal

HENRIETTE I certainly do

     She crosses to the other side of the stage and sits down ALBERT
     rises and goes up to her

ALBERT Henriette No Laughing I see your trick

HENRIETTE What do you mean

ALBERT You cant deceive me by pretending to be angry You wanted to
see whether I could withstand your temper Let us now proceed to the
next chapter your manner of dressing

HENRIETTE Now really outraged My manner of dressing You dare

     HENRIETTE crosses L Front ALBERT following her

ALBERT Yes that will be enough for today

HENRIETTE And then youll begin again tomorrow

ALBERT Yes

HENRIETTE And do you think for one minute that Ill listen to you while
you insult me to my face You are the vain one to think you can come
to that You are the frivolous one you are the

ALBERT Slightly perturbed Be careful what you say

HENRIETTE Ill take care of that Let me tell you that you are a
detestable cynic You are disgustingly personal always dwelling on
details on the least

ALBERT Which is as much as calling me a fool

HENRIETTE Just about You would be if you didnt read your morning
paper regularly so regularly that I know in advance exactly what you
are going to say to me during the day

ALBERT Why not call me a parrot

HENRIETTE That would flatter you for you dont speak as well as a
parrot a parrots memory never gets clouded a parrot has at least the
common politeness to

ALBERT Between his teeth I wont stand for this I wonder how you
could have endured me so long if you thought me such a fool

HENRIETTE I believed you harmless

ALBERT Are you aware that you have wounded me cruelly

HENRIETTE You have wounded me Thank heaven though we had this
discussion Now Ill know how to conduct myself toward you in the
future

ALBERT Thank heaven for the same thing It was high time I grieve to
think that only last night I had fully made up my mind to ask you to be
my wife

HENRIETTE My dear friend if you ever do so I shall show you the door
immediately

     Enter JACQUES hurriedly HENRIETTE runs to him as for
     protection

JACQUES Whats all this noise Whats the matter

HENRIETTE Oh JacquesIm so glad youve come

ALBERT Just in time You put an end to our pleasant little ttette

JACQUES But whats happened

HENRIETTE Well monsieur here

ALBERT No it was mademoiselle who

     HENRIETTE and ALBERT each take an arm of JACQUES and bring
     him downstage C His attention is constantly shifting from one
     to the other as they address him in turn

HENRIETTE Just think Jacques

ALBERT Jacques she had the audacity to

HENRIETTE Stop Im going to tell him first

JACQUES Youre both too excited to explain anything Albert you take a
little stroll and cool off

ALBERT Retreating toward the door Charmed

HENRIETTE Then I can draw a free breath

JACQUES To ALBERT Ill fix up things while youre away

ALBERT To both I wont give in

HENRIETTE Neither will I

JACQUES Tut tut

ALBERT Goodday mademoiselle

HENRIETTE Goodday

JACQUES Goodday Albert

     Exit ALBERT

HENRIETTE Thank goodness were rid of him

JACQUES Sympathetically Tell me all about it

HENRIETTE Sits down on sofa inviting JACQUES by a gesture to do
the same He sits beside her That man invented the most abominable
things about me criticised me to my face

JACQUES He did

HENRIETTE It was so ridiculousmakes me sick to think about it

JACQUES My dear Henriette dont think about it Albert must have
behaved like a brute to make you so angry

HENRIETTE Yes dont you think so You think Im right

JACQUES Loyally Of course I do

HENRIETTE At her ease once more You encourage me Jacques

JACQUES When I saw you were angry I said to myself at once Henriette
is right

HENRIETTE Really

JACQUES I said it because I knew you were by nature peaceloving and
considerate

HENRIETTE With profound conviction Well I think thats the least
that could be said of me

JACQUES In any event you are always tactful you always

HENRIETTE You know me Jacques

JACQUES I flatter myself I felt instinctively you couldnt be wrong
You have always been so admirably poised so unfailingly considerate

HENRIETTE With perfect simplicity Frankly now do I ever lose my
temper with you

JACQUES In good faith Never With me you are always patient
gracious modest

HENRIETTE But I remember a little while ago I made you suffer

JACQUES Yes I was unhappy But if after every storm comes such a
calm

HENRIETTE It was all my fault You understand me you are truly a
friend

JACQUES Nothing more

     Rising but standing near her HENRIETTE blushingly looks down
     at her shoe

HENRIETTE Oh

JACQUES Prove that you mean that sincerely

HENRIETTE What have I to do Same business

JACQUES Place your future in my hands marry me

HENRIETTE With downcast eyes I was just thinking about it Same
business but with repressed joy

JACQUES About to embrace her Ah

HENRIETTE Wait

     Complete metamorphosis Her joy is still present but it has
     taken on a playful seriocomic aspect Rising and putting her hand

     Neli Williams his wife a comely capable young woman busy with
     her knitting every instant she talks is clad in her market

HUGH Aye yell get no blessin from such worldliness

NELI Absentmindedly Maybe not but ye will get a dinner from that
unblessed worldliness an find no fault Im thinkin Her hand

An such eloquence Such an understandin of sin Such glowin pictures
of Babylon

HUGH Aye hot I tell ye Neli theres no man in the parish has such a
gift of eloquence as Deacon Roberts or such theology In all Wales yell
not find stronger theology than his

NELI Ye have no need to tell me that Looking for a place in which to
hide the book until she returns Have I not a deep an proper
admiration for theology Have I not had one minister an five deacons
an a revivalist in my family to say nothin at all of one composer of

HUGH Triumphantly Aye aye thats it Thats it An the more
need have I to read till my nostrils are full of the smoke ofof
Babylon

NELI Absentmindedly tucking book away on shelf as she talks Aye
but there has been some smoke about Deacon Robertss reputation which
has come from some fire less far away than Babylon

HUGH What smoke

NELI Evasively Well I am thinkin about my eggs which vanished
one week ago today There was no one in that mornin but Deacon
Roberts Mrs Jones the Wash had come for her soap an gone before I

     characteristic of her and HUGH shrinks into himself She shakes
     her finger at him and goes over to kiss him

NELI Hughie lad yere not to touch the book while I am gone to

     NELI leaves by door at back centre Immediately HUGH steals
     toward the shelves where she hid the book

NELI Thrusting head back in Mind Hughie lad no readinnay not

HUGH Stepping quickly away from shelves and repeating parrotlike
Nay nay no readin no sermons not even any theology

NELI An no salvation till I come back

     She smiles withdraws head and is gone HUGH starts forward
     collides clumsily with the counter in his eagerness knocks the
     basket of eggs with his elbow upsetting it Several eggs break He
     shakes his head ruefully at the mess and as ruefully at the
     counter He finds book and hugs it greedily to him

HUGH Mournfully Look at this What did I say but that there was no
salvation sellin groceries If Neli could but see those eggs He
goes behind counter and gets out a box of eggs from which he refills
the basket The broken eggs he leaves untouched upon the floor He opens
his volume of sermons and seats himself by a little threelegged table
near the fire He sighs in happy anticipation Hearing a slight noise
he looks suspiciously at door gets up tiptoes across floor to street
door and locks it quietly An expression of triumph overspreads his
face Da if customers come they will think no one is at home
whatever an I can read on He seats himself at little threelegged
table opens volume smooths over its pages lovingly and begins to read
slowly and halting over syllables The smoke of Babylon was
hotscorchin hot An twas filled with Babababaal stones slimy
an scorchin hot also

     There is the sound of feet coming up the shop steps followed by
     a hand trying the doorknob HUGH looks up from his sermons an
     expression of innocent triumph on his face The doorknob is tried
     again the door rattled

     Then some one rings the shop doorbell

MRS JONES THE WASH Calling Mrs Williams mum have ye any soap
No answer Calling Mrs Williams Mrs Williams

     HUGH nods approvingly and lifts his volume to read

MRS JONES THE WASH Where are they all whatever I will just look in at
the window A large kindly face is anxiously flattened against the
window At that HUGH drops in consternation under the threelegged
table Uch whats that shadow skippin under the table No doubt a

     at last NELI fearfully still spellbound by the DEACONS
     eloquence lifts her eyes to the clock Then cautiously she turns
     a little toward the fire and the place of DEACON ROBERTS

     pursues the DEACON out into the bright midday sunshine

    MR ESPENHAYNE
    HILDA




WHERE BUT IN AMERICAJ


     SCENE The Espenhayne diningroom

     The curtain rises on the Espenhayne diningroom It is furnished
     with modest taste and refinement There is a door centre leading
     to the livingroom and a swinging door left leading to the
     kitchen

     The table is set and ROBERT and MOLLIE ESPENHAYNE are
     discovered at their evening meal They are educated wellbred
     young Americans ROBERT is a pleasing energetic business man of
     thirty MOLLIE an attractive woman of twentyfive The bouillon
     cups are before them as the curtain rises

BOB Mollie I heard from the man who owns that house in Kenilworth He
wants to sell the house He wont rent

MOLLIE I really dont care Bob That house was too far from the
station and it had only one sleepingporch and you know I want
whiteenamelled woodwork in the bedrooms But Bob Ive been terribly
stupid

BOB How so Mollie

MOLLIE You remember the Russells moved to Highland Park last spring

BOB Yes Ed Russell rented a house that had just been built

MOLLIE A perfectly darling little house And Fanny Russell once told me
that the man who built it will put up a house for any one who will take
a fiveyear lease And she says that the man is very competent and they
are simply delighted with their place

BOB Why dont we get in touch with the man

MOLLIE Wasnt it stupid of me not to think about it It just flashed
into my mind this morning and I sat down at once and sent a
specialdelivery letter to Fanny Russell I asked her to tell me his
name at once and where we can find him

BOB Good You ought to have an answer by tomorrow or Thursday and
well go up north and have a talk with him on Saturday

MOLLIE With enthusiasm Wouldnt it be wonderful if hed build just
what we want Fanny Russell says every detail of their house is perfect
Even the garage they use it

BOB Interrupting Mollie thats the one thing Im afraid of about
the North Shore plan Ive said repeatedly that I dont want to buy a
car for another year or two But here you are talking about a garage
already

MOLLIE But you didnt let me finish what I was saying The Russells
have fitted up their garage as a playroom for the children If we had a
garage we could do the same thing

BOB Well lets keep temptation behind us and not even talk to the man
about a garage If we move up north it must be on an economy basis for a
few years just a halfway step between the apartment and the house we
used to plan You mustnt get your heart set on a car

MOLLIE I havent even thought of one dear BOB and MOLLIE have now
both finished the bouillon course and lay down their spoons Reaching
out her hand to touch the table button and at the same time leaning
across the table and speaking very impressively Bob Im about to
ring for Hilda

BOB What of it

MOLLIE Decidedly and with a touch of impatience You know very
well what of it I dont want Hilda to hear us say one word about
moving away from the South Side

BOB Protesting But Mollie

MOLLIE Interrupting hurriedly and holding her finger to her lips in
warning Psst

     The next instant HILDA enters left She is a tall blonde
     Swedish girl about twentyfive years old She is very pretty and
     carries herself well and looks particularly charming in a maids
     dress with white collars and cuffs and a dainty waitresss apron
     Every detail of her dress is immaculate

MOLLIE Speaking the instant that HILDA appears and talking very
rapidly all the time that HILDA remains in the room While she speaks
MOLLIE watches HILDA rather than ROBERT whom she pretends to be
addressing In the last game Gert Jones was my partner It was frame
apiece and I dealt and I bid one no trump I had a very weak no trump
Ill admit that but I didnt want them to win the rubber Mrs Stone
bid two spades and Gert Jones doubled her Mrs Green passed and I
simply couldnt go to three of anything Mrs Stone played two spades
doubled and she made them Of course that put them out and gave them
the rubber I think that was a very foolish double of Gert Jones and
then she said it was my fault because I bid one no trump

     As MOLLIE begins her flow of words BOB first looks at her in
     openmouthed astonishment Then as he gradually comprehends that
     MOLLIE is merely talking against time he too turns his eyes to
     HILDA and watches her closely in her movements around the table
     Meanwhile HILDA moves quietly and quickly and pays no attention
     to anything except the work she has in hand She carries a small
     servingtray and as MOLLIE speaks HILDA first takes the
     bouillon cups from the table then brings the carvingknife and
     fork from the sideboard and places them before ROBERT and then
     with the empty bouillon cups exits left BOB and MOLLIE are
     both watching HILDA as she goes out The instant the door swings
     shut behind her MOLLIE relaxes with a sigh and ROBERT leans
     across the table to speak

BOB Mollie why not be sensible about this thing Have a talk with
Hilda and find out if she will move north with us

MOLLIE Thats just like a man Then we might not find a house to please
us and Hilda would be dissatisfied and suspicious She might even leave
Thoughtfully Of course I must speak to her before we sign a lease
because I really dont know what Id do if Hilda refused to leave the
South side More cheerfully But there we wont think about the
disagreeable things until everything is settled

BOB Thats good American doctrine

MOLLIE Warningly and again touching her finger to her lips Psst

     HILDA enters left carrying the meat plates with a heavy napkin
     under them

MOLLIE Immediately resuming her monologue I think my last years
hat will do very nicely You know it rained all last summer and I really
only wore the hat a half a dozen times Perhaps not that often I can
make a few changes on it put on some new ribbons you know and it will
do very nicely for another year You remember that hat dont you dear

     BOB starts to answer but MOLLIE rushes right on

Of course you do you remember you said it was so becoming Thats
another reason why I want to wear it this summer

     HILDA meanwhile puts the plates on the table in front of BOB
     and goes out left MOLLIE at once stops speaking

BOB Holding his hands over the plates as over a fire and rubbing them
together in genial warmth Ah the good hot plates She never forgets
them She is a gem Mollie

MOLLIE In great selfsatisfaction If you are finally convinced of
that after three years I wish you would be a little bit more careful
what you say the next time Hilda comes in the room

BOB In openmouthed astonishment What

MOLLIE Well I dont want Hilda to think we are making plans behind her
back

BOB Reflectively A mans home is his castle Pauses Its
very evident that the Englishman who first said that didnt keep any
servants

     Telephone bell rings off stage

MOLLIE Answer that Bob

BOB Wont Hilda answer it

MOLLIE Standing up quickly and speaking impatiently Very well I
shall answer it myself I cant ask Hilda to run to the telephone while
she is serving the meal

BOB Sullenly as he gets up All right All right

     BOB exits centre As he does so HILDA appears at the door
     left hurrying to answer the telephone

MOLLIE Mr Espenhayne will answer it Hilda

     HILDA makes the slightest possible bow of acquiescence withdraws
     left and in a moment reappears with vegetable dishes and small
     side dishes which she puts before MRS ESPENHAYNE She is
     arranging these when BOB reenters centre

BOB Somebody for you Hilda

HILDA Surprised For me Oh But I cannot answer eet now Please
ask the party to call later

     HILDA speaks excellent English but with some Swedish accent The
     noticeable feature of her speech is the precision and great care
     with which she enunciates every syllable

MOLLIE Just take the number yourself Hilda and tell the party you
will call back after dinner

HILDA Thank you Messes Aispenhayne

     HILDA exits centre BOB stands watching HILDA as she leaves
     the room and then turns and looks at MOLLIE with a bewildered
     expression

BOB Standing at his chair But I thought Hilda couldnt be running
to the telephone while she serves the dinner

MOLLIE But this call is for Hilda herself Thats quite different you
see

BOB Slowly and thoughtfully Oh yes Of course I see Sits down
in his chair That isI dont quite see

MOLLIE Immediately leaning across the table and speaking in a
cautious whisper Do you know who it is

     BOB closes his lips very tightly and nods yes in a very important
     manner

MOLLIE In the same whisper and very impatiently Who

BOB Looking around the room as if to see if any one is in hiding and
then putting his hand to his mouth and exaggerating the whisper The
Terrible Swede

MOLLIE In her ordinary tone and very much exasperated Robert Ive
told you a hundred times that you shouldnt refer totothe man in
that way

BOB And Ive told you a hundred times to ask Hilda his name If I knew
his name Id announce him with as much ceremony as if he were the
Swedish Ambassador

MOLLIE Disgusted Oh dont try to be funny Suppose some day Hilda
hears you speak of him in that manner

BOB You know thats mild compared to what you think of him Suppose
some day Hilda learns what you think of him

MOLLIE I think very well of him and you know it Of course I dread the
time when she marries him but I wouldnt for the world have her think
that we speak disrespectfully of her or her friends

BOB A mans home is his castle

     MOLLIES only answer is a gesture of impatience MOLLIE and
     BOB sit back in their chairs to await HILDAS return Both sit
     with fingers interlaced hands resting on the edge of the table in
     the attitude of school children at attention A long pause MOLLIE
     unclasps her hands and shifts uneasily ROBERT does the same
     MOLLIE seeing this hastily resumes her former attitude of quiet
     waiting ROBERT however grows increasingly restless His
     restlessness makes MOLLIE nervous and she watches ROBERT and
     when he is not observing her she darts quick anxious glances at
     the door centre BOB drains and refills his glass

MOLLIE She has been watching ROBERT and every time he shifts or
moves she unconsciously does the same and finally she breaks out
nervously I dont understand this at all Isnt today Tuesday

BOB What of it

MOLLIE He usually calls up on Wednesdays and comes to see her on
Saturdays

BOB And takes her to the theatre on Thursdays and to dances on Sundays
Hes merely extending his line of attack

     Another long pausethen Bob begins to experiment to learn
     whether the plates are still hot He gingerly touches the edges of
     the upper plate in two or three places It seems safe to handle He
     takes hold of upper and lower plates boldly muttering as he does
     so Cold as Drops the plates with a clatter and a smothered
     oath Shakes his fingers and blows on them Meanwhile MOLLIE is
     sitting very rigid regarding BOB with a fixed stare and beating
     a vigorous tattoo on the tablecloth with her fingers Bob catches
     her eye and cringes under her gaze He drains and refills his
     glass He studies the walls and the ceiling of the room meanwhile
     still nursing his fingers BOB steals a sidelong glance at
     MOLLIE She is still staring at him He turns to his water goblet
     Picks it up and holds it to the light He rolls the stem between
     his fingers squinting at the light through the water Reciting
     slowly as he continues to gaze at the light

BOB Starlight Starbright Will Hilda talk to him all night

MOLLIE In utter disgust Oh stop that singing

     BOB puts down his glass then drinks the water and refills the
     glass He then turns his attention to the silverware and cutlery
     before him He examines it critically then lays a teaspoon
     carefully on the cloth before him and attempts the trick of
     picking it up with the first finger in the bowl and the thumb at
     the point of the handle After one or two attempts the spoon shoots
     on the floor far behind him MOLLIE jumps at the noise BOB
     turns slowly and looks at the spoon with an injured air then
     turns back to MOLLIE with a silly vacuous smile He now lays all
     the remaining cutlery in a straight row before him

BOB Slowly counting the cutlery and silver back and forth Eeny
meeny miney mo Catch aStops suddenly as an idea comes to him
Gazes thoughtfully at MOLLIE for a moment then begins to count over
again Eeny meeny miney mo Hildas talking to her beau If we
holler she may go Eeny mee

MOLLIE Interrupting and exasperated to the verge of tears Bob if
you dont stop all that nonsense I shall scream In a very tense
tone I believe Im going to have one of my sick headaches Puts her
hand to her forehead I know it I can feel it coming on

BOB In a soothing tone Hunger my dear hunger When you have a
good warm meal youll feel better

MOLLIE In despair What do you suppose I ought to do

BOB Go out in the kitchen and fry a couple of eggs

MOLLIE Oh be serious Im at my wits end Hilda never did anything
like this before

BOB Suddenly quite serious What does that fellow do for a living
anyhow

MOLLIE How should I know

BOB Didnt you ever ask Hilda

MOLLIE Certainly not Hilda doesnt ask me about your business why
should I pry into her affairs

BOB Taking out his cigarette case and lighting a cigarette Mollie
I see youre strong for the Constitution of the United States

MOLLIE Suspiciously What do you mean by that

BOB The Constitution says Whereas it is a selfevident truth that all
men are born equalWith a wave of the hand Hilda and you and the
Terrible Swede and I and

MOLLIE Interrupting Bob youre such a heathen Thats not in
the Constitution Thats in the Bible

BOB Well wherever it is until this evening I never realized what a
personage Hilda is

MOLLIE You can make fun of me all you please but I know whats right
Your remarks dont influence me in the leastnot in the least

BOB Murmurs thoughtfully and feelingly How true Abruptly Why
dont they get married Do you know that

MOLLIE All I know is that they are waiting until his business is
entirely successful so that Hilda wont have to work

BOB Well the Swedes are pretty careful of their money The chances are
Hilda has a neat little nestegg laid by

MOLLIE Hesitating and doubtfully Thats one thing that worries me
a little I think Hilda puts moneyintointointo the young mans
business

BOB Indignantly Do you mean to tell me that this girl gives her
money to that fellow and you dont try to find out a thing about him
Who he is or what he does I suppose she supports the loafer

MOLLIE With dignity Hes not a loafer Ive seen him and Ive
talked with him and I know hes a gentleman

BOB Mollie Im getting tired of all that kind of drivel I believe
nowadays women give a good deal more thought to pleasing their maids
than they do to pleasing their husbands

MOLLIE Demurely Well you know Bob your maid can leave you much
easier than your husband canpauses thoughtfully and Im sure shes
much harder to replace

BOB Very angry looking at his watch throwing his napkin on the
table and standing up Mollie our dinner has been interrupted for
fifteen minutes while Hilda entertains her with sarcasm gentleman
friend If you wont stop it I will

     Steps toward the door centre

MOLLIE Sternly pointing to BOBS chair Robert sit down

     BOB pauses momentarily and at the instant HILDA enters
     centre meeting BOB face to face Both are startled BOB in a
     surly manner walks back to his place at the table HILDA
     follows excited and eager BOB sits down and HILDA stands for
     a moment at the table smiling from one to the other and evidently
     anxious to say something BOB and MOLLIE are severe and
     unfriendly They gaze at HILDA coldly Slowly HILDAS
     enthusiasm cools and she becomes again the impassive servant

HILDA Aixcuse me Meeses Aispenhayne I am very sorry I bring the
dinner right in Hilda exits left

BOB Its all nonsense Touches the plates again but this time even
more cautiously than before This time he finds they are entirely safe
to handle These plates are stone cold now

     HILDA enters left with meat platter Places it before BOB He
     serves the meat and MOLLIE starts to serve the vegetables HILDA
     hands MOLLIE her meat plate

MOLLIE Vegetables BOB is chewing on his meat and does not answer
MOLLIE looks at him inquiringly But his eyes are on his plate
Repeating Vegetables Still no answer from BOB Very softly
under her breath Hmm

     MOLLIE helps herself to vegetables and then dishes out a portion
     which she hands to HILDA who in turn places the dish beside
     BOB When both are served HILDA stands for a moment back of the
     table She clasps and unclasps her hands in a nervous manner seems
     about to speak but as BOB and MOLLIE pay no attention to her
     she slowly and reluctantly turns and exits left MOLLIE takes
     one or two bites of the meat and then gives a quick glance at BOB
     He is busy chewing at his meat and MOLLIE quietly lays down her
     knife and fork and turns to the vegetables

BOB Chewing desperately on his meat Tenderloin I believe

MOLLIE Sweetly Yes dear

BOB Imitating MOLLIE a moment back Hmm He takes one or two
more hard bites Mollie I have an idea

MOLLIE Im relieved

BOB Savagely Yes you will be when you hear it When we get that
builders name from Fanny Russell well tell him that instead of a
garage which we dont need he can build a special telephone booth off
the kitchen Then while Hilda serves the dinner

     BOB stops short as HILDA bursts in abruptly left and comes
     to the table

HILDA Aixcuse me Meeses Aispenhayne I am so excited

MOLLIE Anxiously Is anything wrong Hilda

HILDA Explosively Meeses Aispenhayne Meester Leendquist he say
you want to move to Highland Park

     BOB and MOLLIE simultaneously drop their knives and forks and
     look at HILDA in astonishment and wonder

MOLLIE What

BOB Who

HILDA Repeats very rapidly Meester Leendquist he say you look for
house on North Shore

MOLLIE Utterly overcome at HILDAS knowledge and at a loss for
words of denial We move to the North Shore How ridiculous Hilda
where did you get such an idea Turns to ROBERT Robert did you
ever hear anything so laughable She forces a strained laugh Ha
Ha Ha ROBERT has been looking at HILDA in dumb wonder At
MOLLIES question he turns to her in startled surprise He starts to
answer gulps swallows hard and then coughs violently Very sharply
after waiting a moment for BOB to answer Robert Espenhayne will
you stop that coughing and answer me

BOB Between coughs and drinking a glass of water Egh Egh Excuse
me Something eh egh stuck in my throat

MOLLIE Turning to HILDA Some day we might want to move north
Hilda but not now Oh no not now

BOB Who told you that Hilda

MOLLIE Puzzled Who is Mr Lindquist

HILDA Surprised Meester LeendquistPauses a trifle
embarrassed Meester Leendquist ees young man who just speak to me on
telephone He come to see me every Saturday

BOB Oh Mr Lindquist thetheTer

MOLLIE Interrupting frantically and waving her hands at BOB Yes
yes of course You knowMr Lindquist BOB catches himself just in
time and MOLLIE settles back with a sigh of relief then turns to
HILDA with a puzzled air But where did Mr Lindquist get such an
idea

HILDA Mrs Russell tell heem so

MOLLIE Now entirely bewildered What Mrs Russell

HILDA Meeses Russellyour friend

MOLLIE More and more at sea Mrs Edwin Russell who comes to see

MOLLIE But how does Mrs Russell know Mr Lindquist and why should she
tell Mr Lindquist that we expected to move to the North Shore

HILDA Meester Leendquist he build Meeses Russells house That ees
hees business He build houses on North Shore and he sell them and rent
them

     BOB and MOLLIE look at each other and at HILDA in wonder and
     astonishment as the situation slowly filters into their brains A
     long pause

BOB In awe and astonishment You mean that Mr Lindquist the young
man who comes to see you everyeveryevery now and thenis the same
man who put up the Russell house

HILDA Yes Meester Aispenhayne

BOB Slowly And when Mrs Espenhayne points to MOLLIE wrote to
Mrs Russell jerks his thumb to indicate the north Mrs Russell
told Mr Lindquist jerks his thumb in opposite direction and Mr
Lindquist telephoned to you

     Points to HILDA

HILDA Yes Meester Aispenhayne Nodding

BOB Very thoughtfully and slowly Hmm Then slowly resuming his
meal and speaking in mock seriousness in subtle jest at MOLLIE and
imitating her tone of a moment or two back But of course you
understand Hilda we dont want to move to the North Shore now Oh no
not now

HILDA Somewhat crestfallen Yes Meester Aispenhayne

BOB Reflectively But of course if Mr Lindquist builds houses

DAVID PINSKI

David Pinski perhaps the most notable dramatist of the Yiddish Theatre
was born of Jewish parentage April   in Mohilev on the Dnieper
White Russia Because his parents had rabbinical aspirations for him he
was well educated in Hebrew studies Bible and Talmud by his fourteenth
year when he moved to Moscow where he was further trained in classical
and secular studies In  he planned to study medicine in Vienna but
soon returned to Warsaw where he began his literary work as a
shortstory writer In  he took up the study of philosophy and
literature and in  wrote his first plays In  he came to New
York City where he is now editor of the Jewish daily Die Zeit In
 he revisited Germany to see a production of his wellknown comedy
The Treasure by Max Reinhart

Mr Pinski is zealous in his interests in literature drama socialism
and Zionism Drama is to him an interpretation of life and a guide and
leader as were the words of the old poets and prophets The dramatic
technique says he changes with each plot as each plot brings with
it its own technique One thing however must be common to all the
different forms of the dramatic techniqueavoidance of tediousness

Mr Pinski has written a goodly number of plays most of which are on
Yiddish themes Forgotten Souls The Stranger Sufferings The
Treasure The Phonograph and A Dollar may be mentioned Most of
his plays have been produced many times The Stranger played the third
season in Moscow

I wrote A Dollar says he in the summer of  when I was hard
pressed financially I relieved myself of my feelings by a hearty laugh
at the almighty dollar and the race for it Just as I did many summers
before in  when I entertained myself by ridiculing the mad money
joy in the bigger comedy The Treasure

A DOLLAR


     A crossroads at the edge of a forest One road extends from left
     to right the other crosses the first diagonally disappearing into
     the forest The roadside is bordered with grass On the right at
     the crossing stands a signpost to which are nailed two boards
     giving directions and distances

     The afternoon of a summer day A troupe of stranded strolling
     players enters from the left They are ragged and weary The
     COMEDIAN walks first holding a valise in each hand followed by
     the VILLAIN carrying over his arms two huge bundles wrapped in
     bedsheets Immediately behind these the TRAGEDIAN and the OLD
     MAN carrying together a large heavy trunk

COMEDIAN Stepping toward the signpost reading the directions on the
boards and explaining to the approaching fellowactors That way
pointing to right and swinging the valise to indicate the direction
is thirty miles This way pointing to left is fortyfiveand that
way it is thirtysix Now choose for yourself the town that youll never
reach today The nearest way for us is back to where we came from
whence we were escorted with the most splendid catcalls that ever
crowned our histrionic successes

VILLAIN Exhausted Who will lend me a hand to wipe off my
perspiration It has a nasty way of streaming into my mouth

COMEDIAN Stand on your head then and let your perspiration water a
more fruitful soil

VILLAIN Oh

     He drops his arms the bundles fall down He then sinks down onto
     one of them and wipes off the perspiration moving his hand wearily
     over his face The TRAGEDIAN and the OLD MAN approach the
     post and read the signs

TRAGEDIAN In a deep dramatic voice Its hopeless Its hopeless
He lets go his end of the trunk

OLD MAN Lets go his end of the trunk Mm Another stop

     TRAGEDIAN sits himself down on the trunk in a tragicoheroic
     pose knees wide apart right elbow on right knee left hand on
     left leg head slightly bent toward the right COMEDIAN puts down
     the valises and rolls a cigarette The OLD MAN also sits down
     upon the trunk head sunk upon his breast

VILLAIN Thirty miles to the nearest town Thirty miles

COMEDIAN Its an outrage how far people move their towns away from us

VILLAIN We wont strike a town until the day after tomorrow

COMEDIAN Hurrah Thats luck for you Theres yet a dayaftertomorrow
for us

VILLAIN And the old women are still far behind us Crawling

OLD MAN They want the vote and they cant even walk

COMEDIAN We wont give them votes thats settled Down with votes for
women

VILLAIN It seems the devil himself cant take you Neither your tongue
nor your feet ever get tired You get on my nerves Sit down and shut up
for a moment

COMEDIAN Me Haha Im going back there to the lady of my heart
Ill meet her and fetch her hither in my arms

     He spits on his hands turns up his sleeves and strides rapidly
     off toward the left

VILLAIN Clown

OLD MAN How can he laugh and play his pranks even now We havent a
cent to our souls our supply of food is running low and our shoes are
dilapidated

TRAGEDIAN With an outburst Stop it No reckoning The number of
our sins is great and the tale of our misfortunes is even greater Holy
Father Our flasks are empty Id give what is left of our soles
displaying his ragged shoes for just a smell of whiskey

     From the left is heard the laughter of a woman Enter the
     COMEDIAN carrying in his arms the HEROINE who has her hands
     around his neck and holds a satchel in both hands behind his back

COMEDIAN Letting his burden down upon the grass Sit down my love
and rest up We go no further today Your feet your tender little feet
must ache you How unhappy that makes me At the first opportunity I
shall buy you an automobile

HEROINE And in the meantime you may carry me oftener

COMEDIAN The beast of burden hears and obeys

     Enter the INGENUE and the OLD WOMAN each carrying a small
     satchel

INGENUE Weary and pouting Ah No one carried me

     She sits on the grass to the right of the HEROINE

VILLAIN We have only one ass with us

     COMEDIAN stretches himself out at the feet of the HEROINE and
     emits the bray of a donkey OLD WOMAN sits down on the grass to
     the left of the HEROINE

OLD WOMAN And are we to pass the night here

OLD MAN No we shall stop at Hotel Neverwas

COMEDIAN Dont you like our nights lodgings Turning over toward
the OLD WOMAN See the bed is broad and wide and certainly
without vermin Just feel the high grass Such a soft bed you never
slept in And you shall have a cover embroidered with the moon and
stars a cover such as no royal bride ever possessed

OLD WOMAN Youre laughing and I feel like crying

COMEDIAN Crying You should be ashamed of the sun which favors you with
its setting splendor Look and be inspired

VILLAIN Yes look and expire

COMEDIAN Look and shout with ecstasy

OLD MAN Look and burst

     INGENUE starts sobbing TRAGEDIAN laughs heavily

COMEDIAN Turning over to the INGENUE What You are crying Arent
you ashamed of yourself

INGENUE Im sad

OLD WOMAN Sniffling I cant stand it any longer

HEROINE Stop it Or Ill start bawling too

     COMEDIAN springs to his knees and looks quickly from one woman to
     the other

VILLAIN Haha Cheer them up clown

COMEDIAN Jumps up abruptly without the aid of his hands Ladies and
gentlemen I have it In a measured and singing voice Ladies and
gentlemen I have it

HEROINE What have you

COMEDIAN Cheerfulness

VILLAIN Go bury yourself clown

TRAGEDIAN As before Hohoho

OLD MAN Pooh

     The women weep all the louder

COMEDIAN I havea bottle of whiskey

     General commotion The women stop crying and look up to the
     COMEDIAN in amazement the TRAGEDIAN straightens himself out and
     casts a surprised look at the COMEDIAN the OLD MAN rubbing
     his hands jumps to his feet the VILLAIN looks suspiciously at
     the COMEDIAN

TRAGEDIAN A bottle of whiskey

OLD MAN HeheheA bottle of whiskey

VILLAIN Humwhiskey

COMEDIAN You bet A bottle of whiskey hidden and preserved for such
moments as this a moment of masculine depression and feminine tears

     Taking the flask from his hip pocket The expression on the faces
     of all changes from hope to disappointment

VILLAIN You call that a bottle I call it a flask

TRAGEDIAN Explosively A thimble

OLD MAN A dropper

OLD WOMAN For seven of us Oh

COMEDIAN Letting the flash sparkle in the sun But its whiskey my
children Opening the flask and smelling it Uuum Thats
whiskey for you The saloonkeeper from whom I hooked it will become a
teetotaler from sheer despair

     TRAGEDIAN rising heavily and slowly proceeding toward the flask
     VILLAIN still skeptical and rising as if unwilling The OLD MAN
     chuckling and rubbing his hands The OLD WOMAN getting up
     indifferently and moving apathetically toward the flask The
     HEROINE and INGENUE hold each other by the hand and take ballet
     steps in waltz time All approach the COMEDIAN with necks eagerly
     stretched out and smell the flask which the COMEDIAN holds
     firmly in both hands

TRAGEDIAN HohohoFine

OLD MAN HeheSmall quantity but excellent quality

VILLAIN Seems to be good whiskey

HEROINE Dancing and singing My comedian my comedian His head is
in the right place But why didnt you nab a larger bottle

COMEDIAN My beloved one I had to take in consideration both the
quality of the whiskey and the size of my pocket

OLD WOMAN If only theres enough of it to go round

INGENUE Oh Im feeling sad again

COMEDIAN Cheer up there will be enough for us all Cheer up Here
smell it again

     They smell again and cheerfulness reappears They join hands and
     dance and sing forming a circle the COMEDIAN applauding

COMEDIAN Good If you are so cheered after a mere smell of it what
wont you feel like after a drink Wait Ill join you He hides the
whiskey flask in his pocket Ill show you a new roundel which we will
perform in our next presentation of Hamlet to the great edification of
our esteemed audience Kicking the VILLAINS bundles out of the
way The place is clear now for dance and play Join hands and form a
circle but you Villain stay on the outside of it You are to try to
get in and we dance and are not to let you in without getting out of
step Understand Now then

     The circle is formed in the following orderCOMEDIAN HEROINE
     TRAGEDIAN OLD WOMAN OLD MAN INGENUE

COMEDIAN Singing

    To be or not to be that is the question
      That is the question that is the question
    He who would enter in
      Climb he must over us
    If over he cannot
      He must get under us

REFRAIN

    Tralala tralala
      Over us under us
    Tralala tralala
      Under us over us
    Now we are jolly jolly are we

     The COMEDIAN sings the refrain alone at first and the others
     repeat it together with him

COMEDIAN

    To be or not to be that is the question
      That is the question that is the question
    In life to win success
      Elbow your way through
    Jostle the next one
      Else you will be jostled

REFRAIN

Same as before

     On the last word of the refrain they flop as if dumbfounded and
     stand transfixed with eyes directed on one spot inside of the
     ring The VILLAIN leans over the arms of the COMEDIAN and the
     HEROINE gradually the circle draws closer till their heads almost
     touch They attempt to free their handy but each holds on to the
     other and all seven whisper in great astonishment

ALL A dollar

     The circle opens up again they look each at the other and shout
     in wonder

ALL A dollar

     Once more they close in and the struggle to free their hands
     grows wilder the VILLAIN tries to climb over and then under the
     hands into the circle and stretches out his hand toward the dollar
     but instinctively he is stopped by the couple he tries to pass
     between even when he is not seen but only felt Again all lean
     their heads over the dollar quite lost in the contemplation of it
     and whispering enraptured

ALL A dollar

     Separating once again they look at each other with exultation and
     at the same time try to free their hands once more exclaiming in
     ecstasy

ALL A dollar

     Then the struggle to get free grows wilder and wilder The hand
     that is perchance freed is quickly grasped again by the one who
     held it

INGENUE In pain Oh my hands my hands Youll break them Let go
of my hands

OLD WOMAN If you dont let go of my hands Ill bite

     Attempting to bite the hands of the TRAGEDIAN and the OLD
     MAN while they try to prevent it

OLD MAN Trying to free his hands from the hold of the HEROINE and
the OLD WOMAN Let go of me Pulling at both his hands These
womens hands thatseem so frail just look at them now

HEROINE To COMEDIAN But you let go my hands

COMEDIAN I think its you who are holding fast to mine

HEROINE Why should I be holding you If you pick up the dollar what is
yours is mine you know

COMEDIAN Then let go of my hand and Ill pick it up

HEROINE No Id rather pick it up myself

COMEDIAN I expected something like that from you

HEROINE Angrily Let go of my hands thats all

COMEDIAN HahahaIts a huge joke In a tone of command Be
quiet They become still We must contemplate the dollar with
religious reverence Commotion Keep quiet I say A dollar is
spread out before us A real dollar in the midst of our circle and
everything within us draws us toward it draws us on irresistibly Be
quiet Remember you are before the Ruler before the Almighty On your
knees before him and pray On your knees

     Sinks down on his knees and drags with him the HEROINE and
     INGENUE OLD MAN dropping on his knees and dragging the OLD
     WOMAN with him

OLD MAN Hehehe

TRAGEDIAN Hohoho clown

COMEDIAN To TRAGEDIAN You are not worthy of the serious mask you
wear You dont appreciate true Divine Majesty On your knees or youll
get no whiskey TRAGEDIAN sinks heavily on his knees O holy dollar
O almighty ruler of the universe before thee we kneel in the dust and
send toward thee our most tearful and heartfelt prayers Our hands are
bound but our hearts strive toward thee and our souls yearn for thee O
great king of kings thou who bringest together those who are separated
and separatest those who are near thou who

     The VILLAIN who is standing aside takes a full jump clears
     the INGENUE and grasps the dollar All let go of one another and
     fall upon him shouting screaming pushing and fighting Finally
     the VILLAIN manages to free himself holding the dollar in his
     right fist The others follow him with clenched fists glaring
     eyes and foaming mouths wildly shouting

ALL The dollar The dollar The dollar Return the dollar

VILLAIN Retreating You cant take it away from me its mine It
was lying under my bundle

ALL Give up the dollar Give up the dollar

VILLAIN In great rage No no A moment during which the opposing
sides look at each other in hatred Quietly but with malice Moreover
whom should I give it to To youyouyouyou

COMEDIAN Hahahaha He is right the dollar is his He has it
therefore it is his Hahahaha and I wanted to crawl on my knees
toward the dollar and pick it up with my teeth Hahahaha but he got
ahead of me Hahahaha

HEROINE Whispering in rage Thats because you would not let go of
me

COMEDIAN Hahahaha

TRAGEDIAN Shaking his fist in the face of the VILLAIN Heaven and
hell I feel like crushing you

     He steps aside toward the trunk and sits down in his former
     pose INGENUE lying down on the grass starts to cry

COMEDIAN Hahaha Now we will drink and the first drink is the
Villains

     His proposition is accepted in gloom the INGENUE however
     stops crying the OLD MAN and the OLD WOMAN have been
     standing by the VILLAIN looking at the dollar in his hand as if
     waiting for the proper moment to snatch it from him Finally the
     OLD WOMAN makes a contemptuous gesture and both turn aside from
     the VILLAIN The latter left in peace smooths out the dollar
     with a serious expression on his face The COMEDIAN hands him a
     small glass of whiskey

COMEDIAN Drink lucky one

     The VILLAIN shutting the dollar in his fist takes the whiskey
     glass gravely and quickly drinks the contents returning the glass
     He then starts to smooth and caress the dollar again The
     COMEDIAN still laughing passes the whiskey glass from one to the
     other of the company who drink sullenly The whiskey fails to
     cheer them After drinking the INGENUE begins to sob again The
     HEROINE who is served last throws the empty whiskey glass toward
     the COMEDIAN

COMEDIAN Good shot Now Ill drink up all thats left in the bottle

     He puts the flask to his lips and drinks The HEROINE tries to
     knock it away from him but he skilfully evades her The VILLAIN
     continues to smooth and caress the dollar

VILLAIN Hahaha Singing and dancing

    He who would enter in
      Jump he must over us

Hohoho O Holy Dollar O Almighty Ruler of the World O King of
Kings Hahaha Dont you all think if I have the dollar and you
have it not that I partake a bit of its majesty That means that I am
now a part of its majesty That means that I am the Almighty Dollars
plenipotentiary and therefore I am the Almighty Ruler himself On your
knees before me Hehehe

COMEDIAN After throwing away the empty flask lies down on the
grass Well roared lion but you forgot to hide your jackasss ears

VILLAIN It is ones consciousness of power Hehehe I know and you
know that if I have the money I have the say Remember none of you has
a cent to his name The whiskey is gone Picking up the flask and
examining it

COMEDIAN I did my job well Drank it to the last drop

VILLAIN Yes to the last drop This evening you shall have bread and
sausage Very small portions too for tomorrow is another day
INGENUE sobbing more frequently Not till the day after tomorrow
shall we reach town and that doesnt mean that you get anything to eat
there either but IIIhehehe O Holy Dollar Almighty Dollar
Gravely He who does my bidding shall not be without food

COMEDIAN With wideopen eyes What Hahaha

VILLAIN Bandits Thieves

TRAGEDIAN Silence or Ill shut your mouth

     Goes back to the trunk and assumes his heroic pose

COMEDIAN Putting the dollar into his pocket Thats what I call a
successful and a bloodless revolution except for a little fright and
heart palpitation on the part of the late master and breadgiver
Listen some one is coming Perhaps hell be able to change the dollar
and then we can divide it at once

OLD MAN I am puzzled how we can change it into equal parts

     Starts to calculate with the INGENUE and the OLD WOMAN

HEROINE Tenderly attentive to the COMEDIAN You are angry with me
but I was only playing with him so as to wheedle the dollar out of him

COMEDIAN And now you want to trick me out of my share of it

OLD MAN It is impossible to divide it into equal parts It is
absolutely impossible If it were ninetyeight cents or one hundred and
five cents or

     The STRANGER enters from the right perceives the company
     greets it and continues his way to left COMEDIAN stops him

COMEDIAN I beg your pardon sir perhaps you have change of a dollar in
dimes nickels and pennies

     Showing the dollar The OLD MAN and women step forward

STRANGER Getting slightly nervous starts somewhat makes a quick
movement for his pistolpocket looks at the COMEDIAN and the others
and says slowly Change of a dollar Moving from the circle to
left I believe I have

WOMEN Hurrah

STRANGER Turns so that no one is behind him and pulls his revolver
Hands up

COMEDIAN In a gentle tone of voice My dear sir we are altogether
peaceful folk

STRANGER Takes the dollar from the COMEDIANS hand and walks
backwards to left with the pistol pointed at the group Goodnight
everybody

     He disappears the actors remain dumb with fear with their hands
     up mouths wide open and staring into space

COMEDIAN Finally breaks out into thunderous laughter
Hahahahahaha

     portrait of Bettys mother There are two doors one leading into
     the hall at centre left the other communicating with the rest of
     the house upstage right A straight highbacked settee is
     downstage right while in the centre back towers an old
     grandfathers clockK To the left of the clock is the window
     crossbarred and draped with flowered chintz An oldfashioned
     table occupies the corner between the window and the hall door
     Here and there are various straightbacked chairs of Dutch origin
     Rag rugs cover the floor

     As the curtain rises COTTON MATHER is seated in a large armchair
     by the fire with BETTY on a stool at his feet with her
     knitting

     COTTON his hair already touched with the whitening frost of many
     a severe New England winter is grave and sedate Very much
     exercised with the perils of this life and serenely contemplative
     of the life to come he takes himself and the world about him very
     seriously

     Not so with MISTRESS BETTY Outwardly demure yet inwardly
     rebellious against the straitened conventions of the times she
     dimples over with roguish merriment upon the slightest
     provocation

     As we first see them COTTON is giving BETTY some timely
     advice

COTTON But you must understand that marriage my daughter is a most
reverend and serious matter which should be approached in a manner
fittingly considerate of its grave responsibility

BETTY Thoughtfully Truly reverend and most serious father
looking up roguishly but I like not so much of the grave about it

COTTON Continuing I fear thou lookest upon the matter too lightly
It is not seemly to treat such a momentous occasion thus flippantly

BETTY Protesting Nay father why consider it at all Marriage is
yet a great way off Mayhap I shall never leave thee

COTTON Thou little thinkest that I may be suddenly called on to leave
thee The Good Word cautions us to boast not ourselves of the morrow
for we know not what a day may bring forth

BETTY Dropping her knitting Father thou art not feeling well
Perhaps

COTTON Nay child be not alarmed Tis but a most necessary lesson to
be learned and laid up in the heart I will not always be with thee and
I would like to be comfortably assured of thy future welfare before I
go

BETTY Picking her knitting up Be comfortably assured then I
prithee I have no fears

COTTON Bringing his arm down forcibly on the arm of the chair Aye
There it is Thou hast no fears Would that thou hadst some Looks up
at the portrait Had thy prudent and virtuous mother only lived to
point the way I might be spared this anxiety but beset by diverse
difficulties in establishing the kingdom of God in this country and
sorely harassed by many hardships and by evil men I fear me I have not
propounded to thee much that I ought

BETTY In what then is mine education lacking Have I not all that is
fitting and proper for a maiden to know

COTTON Perplexed I know not I have done my best but thou hast
not the proper attitude of mind befitting a maiden about to enter the
married estate

BETTY Protesting Nay but I am not about to enter the married
estate

COTTON It is time

BETTY Mockingly pleading Entreat me not to leave thee father nor
forsake thee for whither thou goest I will go and whither

COTTON Interrupting sternly Betty It ill befitteth a daughter of
mine to quote the Scriptures with such seeming irreverenceI would not
be parted from thee yet I would that thou wert promised to some godly
and upright soul that would guide thee yet more surely in the paths of
righteousness There be many such

BETTY Yea too many

COTTON What meanest thou

BETTY One were one too many when I would have none

COTTON Shaking his head Ah Betty Betty When wilt thou be
serious There is a goodly youth among the friends surrounding thee whom
I have often marked both on account of his godly demeanor and simple
wisdom

BETTY Nodding Yea simple

COTTON I speak of Adonijah Wigglesworth a most estimable young
gentleman an acquaintance whom thou wouldst do well to cultivate

BETTY Yea cultivate

COTTON What thinkest thou

BETTY A sod too dense for any ploughshare My wit would break in the
turning

COTTON His is a strong nature born to drive and not be driven There
is not such another nay not in the whole of Boston

BETTY Nay I have lately heard there be many such

COTTON Testily Mayhap thou wouldst name a few

BETTY Musingly holds up her left hand with fingers outspread Aye
that I can Checks off one on the little finger There be Marcus
Ainslee

COTTON A goodly youth that hath an eye for books

BETTY One eye sayest thou Nay four and since I am neither morocco
bound nor edged with gilt let us consign him to the shelf wherein he
findeth fullest compensation

COTTON How now A man of action then should appeal to thy brash
tastes What sayest thou to Jeremiah Wadsworth

BETTY Too brash and rash for me checking off that candidate on the
next finger and Ill have none of him Theres Percy Wayne

COTTON Of the bluest blood in Boston

BETTY Yet that be not everything checks off another fingerand
Jonas Appleby

COTTON He hath an eye to worldly goods

BETTY Quickly Especially the larder To marry him would be an
everlasting round between the tankard and the kettle Checks him
off Nay let me look yet fartherJames Endicott Checking

COTTON Aye there might be a lad for thee birth breeding a
wellfavored countenance and most agreeable

BETTY Yea most agreeableunto himself Twere a pity to disturb such
unanimity Therefore let us pass on Take Charles Manning an you
please

COTTON It pleaseth me not I know the ilk his father before him a
devoted servant of the devil and King Charles With others of his kind
he hath brought dissension among the young men of Harvard many of whom
are dedicated to the service of the Lord with his wicked apparel and
ungodly fashion of wearing long hair after the manner of Russians and
barbarous Indians Many there be with him brought up in such pride as
doth in no ways become the service of the Lord The devil himself hath
laid hold on our young men so that they do evaporate senseless
useless noisy impertinency wherever they may be and now it has een
got out in the pulpits of the land to the great grief and fear of many
godly hearts

     He starts to his feet and paces the floor

BETTY Standing upright But Charles

COTTON Interrupting Mention not that scapegrace in my hearing

BETTY Still persisting But father truly thou knowest not

COTTON Almost savagely while BETTY retreats to a safe distance
Name him not I will not have it Compared with Adonijah he is a reed
shaken in the winds whereas Adonijah resembleth a tree planted by the
river of waters

BETTY Who has been looking out of the window Converse of the devil
and thou wilt behold his horns Even now he approacheth the knocker

     The knocker sounds

COTTON Sternly Betake thyself to thine own chamber with thine
unseemly tongue which so ill befitteth a maid

     BETTY is very demure with head slightly bent and downcast eyes
     but the moment COTTON turns she glances roguishly after his
     retreating form then while her glance revolves about the room she
     starts slightly as her gaze falls upon the clock A smile of
     mischievous delight flits over her countenance as she tiptoes in
     COTTONS wake until the clock is reached COTTON unsuspecting
     meanwhile proceeds to do his duty as host with never a backward
     glance While he is out in the hall BETTY with a lingering smile
     of triumph climbs into the clock and cautiously peeks forth as her
     father opens the door and ushers in ADONIJAH whereupon the door
     softly closes

ADONIJAH Goodmorrow reverend sir

COTTON Enter and doubly welcome

ADONIJAH I would inquire whether thy daughter Betty is within

COTTON We were but speaking of thee as thy knock sounded Betty will be
here presently she hath but retired for the moment Remove thy wraps
and make thyself in comfort

     ADONIJAH is a lean lank lanternjawed individual clad in the
     conventional sober gray of the Puritan with highcrowned hat and
     a fur tippet wound about his neck up to his ears He removes the
     hat and tippet and hands them to COTTON who carefully places
     them upon the table meanwhile ADONIJAH looks appraisingly about
     him and judiciously selects the armchair by the fire He pauses a
     moment to rub his hands before the blaze and then gingerly relaxes
     into the depths of the armchair as though fearful his comfort
     would give way ere fully attained COTTON places a chair on the
     other side of ADONIJAH and is seated

COTTON And how is it with thee since I have seen thee last

ADONIJAH My business prospereth mournfully but not so finely as it
might well do

     The clock strikes four but is unnoticed by the two men

COTTON Thou hast suffered some great loss

ADONIJAH But yesand nothis matter of lending money hath many and
grievous complications not the least of which is the duplicity of the
borrower I but insist on the thirty pounds to the hundred as my due
recompense and when I demand it they respond not but let my kindness
lie under the clods of ingratitude Straightening up and speaking
with conviction They shall come before the council I will have what
is mine own

COTTON Righteously And it is not unbecoming of thee to demand it
I wist not what the present generation is coming to

ADONIJAH They have no sense of the value of money They know not how to
demean themselves properly in due proportion to their worldly goods as
the Lord hath prospered them There be many that have nothing and do
hold their heads above us that be worthy of our possessions

COTTON The wicked stand in slippery places It will not always be thus
Judgment shall come upon them

ADONIJAH Aye let them fall I for one have upheld them too far They
squander their means in riotous living and walk not in the ways of
their fathers

COTTON There be many suchmany suchbut thou my lad thou art not
one of the multitude As I have often observed to my Betty thou
standest out as a most upright and Godfearing young man

ADONIJAH Brimming over with selfsatisfaction That have I ever
sought to be

COTTON An example that others would do well to imitate

ADONIJAH All puffed up Nay others value it not They be envious
of my good fortune

COTTON A most prudent young man Nay be not so overblushingly timid
Thourt too modest

ADONIJAH His face falling But Bettydoth she regard me thus

COTTON The ways of a maid are past finding out but despair not I
think she hath thee much to heart but as the perverse heart of woman
dictateth behaveth much to the contrary

ADONIJAH Brightening up as one with new hopes Thou thinkest

COTTON Interrupting Nay lad I am sure of it Betty was ever a
dutiful daughter

     All unseen BETTY peeks out mischievously

ADONIJAH But I mistrust me her heart is elsewhere

COTTON Thou referrst to young Manning without doubt It can never be
Tis but a passing fancy

ADONIJAH Nay but I fear Charles thinketh not so I have been told in
secret leaning forward confidentially by one that hath every
opportunity to know that he hath enjoined Goodman Shrewsbury to send
forimpressively a ring

COTTON Angered A ring sayest thou

ADONIJAH Nodding Aye even so

COTTON But he hath not signified such intention here to me

ADONIJAH Then there are no grounds for his rash presumption

COTTON Humph Grounds For a ring Aye therell be no diabolical
circle here for the devil to daunce in I will question Betty thereon
Rises Do thou remain here and I will send her to thee Oh that he
should offer daughter of mine a ring

     COTTON leaves the room ADONIJAH leans back in his chair in
     supreme contentment at the turn affairs have taken The clamorous
     knocker arouses him from his reverie He gazes stupidly around The
     continued imperious tattoo on the knocker finally brings him to his
     feet He goes into the hall and opens the door His voice is
     heard

ADONIJAH Frostily Goodafternoon Sir Charles mine host is
absent

CHARLES Stepping in My mission has rather to do with Mistress
Betty Is she in

ADONIJAH Closing the hall door and turning to CHARLES replies in
grandiose hauteur Mistress Betty is otherwise engaged I would have
thee know

CHARLES Engaged Bowing Your humble servant I trust hath the
supreme pleasure of that engagement

     He glances inquiringly about the room and places the hat on the
     table beside that of ADONIJAH The two hats are as different as
     the two men ADONIJAHS prim Puritanic severe CHARLESS
     threecornered with a flowing plume

     CHARLES is a handsome chap of goodly proportions with a
     straightforward air and a pleasant smile He is dressed more after
     the fashion of the cavaliers of Virginia and wears a long wig with
     flowing curls The two men size each other up

ADONIJAH Meaningly Her father will shortly arrive

CHARLES Impatiently striding forth Devil take her father Tis
Mistress Betty I would see Where is she

     CHARLES continues pacing the floor ADONIJAH shocked beyond
     measure turns his back on the offending CHARLES and with folded
     arms and bowed head stands aside in profound meditation The clock
     door slowly opens and BETTY cautiously peeks out CHARLES stops
     short and is about to begin a decided demonstration when BETTY
     with a warning glance toward ADONIJAH checks him with upraised
     hand The clock door closes and CHARLES subsides into the
     armchair with a comprehending grin of delight ADONIJAH slowly
     turns and faces CHARLES with a melancholy air

CHARLES Prithee why so sad

     The grin becomes a chuckle


ADONIJAH I do discern no cause for such unrighteous merriment

CHARLES Tis none the less for all of that I take life as I find it
and for that matter so do they all even thou The difference be in the
finding Whistles

ADONIJAH Uneasily It is time her father did arrive

CHARLES Where then hath he been

ADONIJAH He but went in search of Betty

CHARLES Ah then well wait

     He whistles while ADONIJAH moves uneasily about the room
     glancing every now and then at this disturbing element of his
     peace as if he would send him to kingdom come if he only could

ADONIJAH After considerable toleration Waiting may avail thee
naught

CHARLES And thee Nevertheless well wait Whistles

ADONIJAH Takes another turn or two and fetches up a counterfeit
sigh Methinks her fathers quest be fruitless

CHARLES Starting up Ah then let us go

     ADONIJAH visibly relieved sits down in the chair opposite

CHARLES Amused Nay Sits down and relaxes Ah then well
wait Whistles

ADONIJAH Troubled Tis certain Mistress Betty be not here

CHARLES Nay if she be not here then I am neither here nor there I
would wager ten pounds to a farthing she be revealed in time if she but
will it Wilt take me up

ADONIJAH It be not seemly so to stake thy fortune on a womans whim

CHARLES Laughs Thourt right on it If she will say I for if she
will she wont and if she wont she will

ADONIJAH False jargon A woman has no will but een her fathers as a
maid her husbands later still

     Enter COTTON who stops short on seeing CHARLES rallies
     quickly and proceeds

COTTON Stiffly Goodday to you sir

CHARLES Bowing he has risen And to you sire

COTTON To ADONIJAH I am deeply grieved to report that Mistress
Betty is not to be found

     ADONIJAH steals a sly look of triumph at CHARLES

CHARLES In mock solemnity I prithee present my deep regrets to
Mistress Betty I will call again

COTTON God speed thee And as CHARLES takes his leave COTTON
places his hand affectionately upon ADONIJAHS shoulder saying
reassuringly Come again my son Betty may not be afar off I fain
would have her soon persuaded of thy worth Improve thy time

ADONIJAH Beaming Good morrow sir I will

     As the door closes behind them COTTON slowly walks toward the
     fire where he stands in complete revery Still absorbed in thought
     he walks slowly out the door at the right BETTY peeks cautiously
     out but hearing footsteps quickly withdraws COTTON reenters
     with hat on He is talking to himself reflectively

COTTON Where can she be Mayhap at Neighbor Ainslees

     He goes hurriedly out through the hall door The banging of the
     outside door is heard The clock door once more slowly opens and
     BETTY peers forth listening The sound of a door opening causes
     her to draw back As the noise is further emphasized by approaching
     footsteps she pulls the clock door quickly to CHARLES enters
     He looks inquiringly about tosses his hat on the table and goes
     for the clock He opens it with a gay laugh BETTY steps forth
     out of the clock very much assisted by CHARLES

CHARLES Blessed relief Thou art in very truth then flesh and blood

BETTY And what else should I be forsooth

CHARLES Laughing I marked thee for a mummy there entombed

BETTY Disengaging her hand What Darest thou

CHARLES A lively mummy now thou art come to whilst I sighsI
waited through the ages

BETTY Laughingly A veritable monument of patient grief

CHARLES And Adonijah

BETTY Yea verily old Father Time but come to life Mimics Thy
waiting may avail thee naught

CHARLES In truth it may avail me naught thy father may be back at any
time while I have much to say sweet Betty

BETTY Interrupting Nay sweet Betty call me not

CHARLES Dear Betty then the dearest

BETTY Quickly Yea call me dearest mummy Hottentot or what you
will just so it be not sweet like Adonijah It sickens me beyond
expressing

CHARLES Then sweet Betty thou art not say rather sour Betty
cross Betty mean Betty bad Betty mad Betty sad Betty

BETTY Suddenly dimpling Nay glad Betty

CHARLES Art then so glad Wilt tell me why In sooth I know not
whither to be glad or sad or mad Sometimes I am but one sometimes I
am all three

BETTY Wilt tell me why

CHARLES Stepping closer and imprisoning her left hand Thou wilt
not now escape it for I will tell thee why and mayhap this will aid
me Slips ring which he has had concealed in his pocket on her
finger Hath this no meaning for thee

BETTY Her eyes sparkling with mischief Aye tis a diabolical
circle for the devil to daunce in

CHARLES In astonishment A what

BETTY Slowly A diabolical circle for the devil to daunce inso
father saith Likewise Adonijah

CHARLES Weakly endeavoring to comprehend A diabolical circlebut
whatsay it again Betty

BETTY Repeats slowly emphasizing it with pointed finger A
diabolical circle for the devil to daunce in

CHARLES Throws back his head and laughs May I be the devil

BETTY Shaking her finger at him Then daunce

     They take position as though for a minuet The knocker sounds
     BETTY runs to the window

BETTY Aye theres ADONIJAH at the knocker Into the clockhie
theequick quick

CHARLES Reproachfully And wouldst thou incarcerate me through the
ages Turns to the clock O timely sarcophagus

     CHARLES is smuggled into the clock and BETTY has barely enough
     time to make a dash for the hat and conceal it behind her before
     the door opens and in stalks ADONIJAH He looks about
     suspiciously BETTY faces him with the hat held behind her He
     removes his hat and tippet and lays them on the table

ADONIJAH Methought I heard a sound of many feet

BETTY Looking down Two feet have I no more no less

ADONIJAH Dryly Aye two be quite sufficient

BETTY An thou sayest the word they yet can beat as loud a retreat as
an whole regiment

ADONIJAH Thou dost my meaning misconstrue

BETTY Construe it then I prithee

ADONIJAH I came not here to vex

BETTY Then get thee hence He steps forward BETTY steps back
But not behind me Satan

ADONIJAH Coming closer And yet thou drivst me to it

BETTY Backing off Indeed thou hast a nature born to drive and
not be driven

ADONIJAH Highly complimented So be it yet I scarce had hoped that
thou wouldst notice Advancing Born to drive thou sayest not be
driven

BETTY Retreating Thou hast said it born to drive But what to
drive I have not said That knowledge hath my father yet concealed

ADONIJAH Eagerly Thy father then hath told thee

BETTY Who is retreating steadily across the room Thou wert born to
drive

     Strikes settee and goes down on the hat ADONIJAH seats himself
     beside BETTY BETTY is of necessity forced to remainon the
     hat ADONIJAH slides arm along the back of the settee The clock
     door strikes erratically He jerks his arm back and gazes in the
     direction of the clock The clock hands wigwag ADONIJAH stares
     abstractedly and passes his hand over his forehead in a dazed
     manner

BETTY Solicitously What aileth thee

ADONIJAH Still staring The time

BETTY Stifles a yawn It doth grow late

ADONIJAH But not consistently it changeth

BETTY Twas ever so with time

ADONIJAH Reminiscently Of a certainty they moved

BETTY Yea verily tis not uncommon

ADONIJAH But backwards

BETTY Joyfully Why then my prayers are answered How often I
have prayed them thus to move Yet hath it never come to pass

ADONIJAH Nay hadst thou seen

BETTY Prithee calm thyself Thourt ill

ADONIJAH Steals his arm along the back of the settee and moves over
closer Sweet Betty BETTY looks away with a wry face Thy
indifference in no wise blinds me to thy conception of my true value
BETTY sits up roundeyed There was a time when I despairedThe
clock again strikes wildly The hands drop and rise as before ADONIJAH
excitedly points at the clock Again Didst mark it Something doth
ail the clock

BETTY Yea truly thou art ill The clock behaveth much more to the
point than thou

ADONIJAH Tearing his gaze from the clock As I was on the point of
sayingglances at the clock thy father hath givenanother
glance me to understandwith eye on the clock he hitches up
closer that thou art not averse to mine affections

     As he attempts to put his arm around BETTY the clock strikes a
     tattoo and startles him excitedly to his feet as the hands travel
     all the way round

ADONIJAH Pointing Now look Mark the time

     COTTON enters

COTTON Tarry yet awhile my son the time doth not prevent thee

ADONIJAH Tarry Time doth not prevent Little knowest thou Gazes
abstractedly about Sights the ring on BETTYS finger who in
excitement has forgotten to keep her hands behind her back Aye there
it is the diabolical circle It is a charm It harms her not while all
about me is askew Whence came she here Points at BETTY She
neither came nor went and yet she was not there and now she is A manly
form did enter Yet hath vanished into thin air Yea verily it was
none other than the devil himself in one of his divers forms of which
he hath aplenty The very clock indulgeth in unseemly pranks A strange
influence hangs over me I cannot now abide I must depart from hence
My conscience bids me go

COTTON Striving to detain him Hold Thourt mad

BETTY Nay father he is ill

ADONIJAH Wildly Aye if I be mad thy daughter be to blame The
spell did come upon me I have seen strange things

COTTON What meanest thou

ADONIJAH Pointing at BETTY who regards him wonderingly Thy
daughter is a witch

BETTY Runs to COTTON Oh father

COTTON Consoles BETTY thunders at ADONIJAH What Darest thou to
being forth such an accusation

ADONIJAH Aye while I yet have strength to order mine own will We
shall see what we shall see when the fires leap round the stake All the
diabolical circles the devil may invent or his helpmeets acquire will be
of small avail when the leaping tongues of flame curl round you false
servant of the devil I can delay no longer I will repair to the
council at once and report what I have seen

     BETTY faints away COTTON is at once all paternal solicitude
     ADONIJAH gazes in stupefaction All unobserved CHARLES slips out
     of the clock Finally ADONIJAH as BETTY shows signs of
     reviving turns himself away only to find himself face to face
     with CHARLES ADONIJAH stops dead in his tracks absolutely
     nonplussed

CHARLES Thou goest to the council Thou lackest evidence Behold the
devil an thou wilt

     ADONIJAHS jaw drops He stares unbelievingly COTTON looks up
     in surprise as CHARLES continues

CHARLES An thou goest to the council with such a message the devil
will dog thy very footsteps And match word of thine with word of truth
in such a light that thine own words shall imprison thee in the stocks
over Sunday

     ADONIJAH recovers from his temporary abstraction and seizing his
     hat and tippet tears out the door as if a whole legion of imps
     were in full pursuit CHARLES contemptuously turns on his heel
     and goes over to BETTY who is now clinging to her fathers arm

BETTY Faintly They will not burn me for a witch

CHARLES Savagely Aye let them try it an they will

COTTON Hotly Ayelet them Then starting suddenly with a new
thought But how camst thou here Yea verily it seemeth to me thou
didst materialize out of thin air

     Surveys CHARLES with piercing scrutiny

CHARLES Nay see through me an thou canst Thou wilt find me a most
material shadow the like of which no eye hath ever pierced Twas not
out of the air but out of yonder clock that I materialized

BETTY Yea father I put him there

COTTON Going to the clock and opening it Of a truth the evidence
all told is here Thou wert of a certainty in the clock Takes out
the detached pendulum Steps back and surveys the timepiece whose hands
clearly indicate a time long passed or not yet come And as far as
pendulums are concerned looking ruefully at the one in his hand
thou certainly wert no improve

CHARLES Aye that Ill warrant And may I never more be called to
fulfil such position the requirements be far too exacting for one of my
build and constitution

COTTON But what extremity hath induced thee to take up thine abode in
such a place

     Lays the pendulum aside and gives CHARLES his entire
     attention

CHARLES Why that came all in the course of events as I take it When I
returned a short time ago hard upon mine heels came Adonijah and
being loath either to leave the field or share it I hid within the
clock Once there the temptation to help time in covering its course
grew strong upon me in the hope that Adonijah misled by the lateness of
the hour would soon depart Only I looked not for such a departure
Judge me not too harshly sire for I love thy daughter and if thou
wilt give thy consent to our marriage I will do all that becometh a man
to deserve such treasure

COTTON I like not thy frivolous manner of wearing hair that is not
thine own it becomes thee not And I strongly mistrust thine attitude
toward the more serious things of life

CHARLES If my wig standeth between me and my hearts desire why Ill
have no wig at all He pulls the wig off and tosses it aside BETTY
with a little cry picks it up and smooths its disarranged curls And
as for mine outlook on life I promise thee that hath but matched the
outer trappings and can be doffed as quickly I am as serious beneath
all outward levity as any soberminded judge and can act accordingly

COTTON See to it that thou suit the action to those words My heart is
strangely moved toward thee yet I would ponder the matter more deeply
Turns to BETTY who has been absentmindedly twirling the curls on
the wig And where is thy voice my daughter Thou art strangely
silentas an afterthought for the once But it is of small wonder
since thou hast had enough excitement for one evening Methinks that
scoundrel Adonijah needeth following up Do thou remain with Betty
Charles and I will hasten after him

CHARLES Nay thou needst not trouble thyself regarding Adonijah He
hath much too wholesome a regard for the duckingstool to cause further
mischief

COTTON Nevertheless I will away to the council and make sure He
plants his hat on his head and departs

CHARLES Turning to BETTY who has dropped the wig on the settee
and who is now gazing demurely at the floor And now to finish up
where we left off The devil hath led us a merrier dance than we
suspected Thou hast not truly given answer to the question I have asked
of thee

BETTY What more of an answer wouldst thou yet require

CHARLES Why I have yet had none at all

BETTY Must tell thee further

CHARLES Gravely Thou must

BETTY Mischievously Thenput the question once again

CHARLES Thou knowest the question an thou wilt

BETTY An thou knowest the answer

     CHARLES takes her in his arms


BETTY Holding up her hand so that the ring sparkles Look
Charlesthe diabolical circle

FRAU LINDEMANN When Herr Strbel makes a joke he makes a decent joke a
real genuine joke Oh of course one has to pretend to be angry
sometimesbut as for writing a forged letterMy landa letter with a
gold crown on itthere She takes a letter from her waist and
reads This afternoon Her Highness the Princess von Geldern will
stop at the Fairview Inn to rest an hour or so before making the
descent to the Springs You are requested to have ready a quiet and
comfortable room to guard Her Highness from any annoying advances and
above all to maintain the strictest secrecy regarding this event as
otherwise the royal visit will not be repeated Baroness von Brook maid
of honor to Her Highness Now what have you got to say

ROSA Herr Strbel lent me a book once A maid of honor came into that
too Im sure its a trick

FRAU LINDEMANN Looking out toward the back Dear dear isnt that
Herr Strbel now coming up the hill Today of all days What on earth
does he always want up here

ROSA Pointedly Hes in such favor at the Inn He wont be leaving
here all day

FRAU LINDEMANN That wont do at all Hes got to be sent off If I only
knew how I couldOh ho Ill be disagreeable to himthats the only
way to manage it

     STRBEL enters He is a handsome young fellow without much
     polish but cheerful unaffected entirely at his ease and
     invariably goodnatured

STRBEL Good day everybody

STRBEL Landlady Linda dear why so quiet today

FRAU LINDEMANN In the first place Herr Strbel I would have you know
that my name is Frau Lindemann

STRBEL Just so

FRAU LINDEMANN And secondly if you dont stop your familiarity

STRBEL Singing as ROSA brings him a glass of beer
BeerbeerHeavens and earth how hot it is Drinks

FRAU LINDEMANN If you find it so hot why dont you stay quietly down
there at the Springs

STRBEL Ah my soul thirsts for the heightsmy soul thirsts for the
heights every afternoon Just as soon as ever my sallowfaced pupil has
thrown himself down on the couch to give his red corpuscles a chance to
grow I gayly grasp my Alpine staff and mount to my beloved

FRAU LINDEMANN Scornfully Bah

STRBEL Oh youre thinking that you are my beloved No dearest my
beloved stays down there But to get nearer to her I have to come up
hereup to your telescope With the aid of your telescope I can look
right into her windowsee

ROSA Laughing Oh so thats why

FRAU LINDEMANN Perhaps you think Im interested in all that Besides
Ive no more time for you Moreover Im going to have this place
cleaned right away Goodby Herr Strbel Goes out

STRBEL Laughing I certainly caught it that time See here Rosa
whats got into her head

ROSA Mysteriously Ahem there are crowned heads and other
headsandahemthere are letters with crowns and letters without
crowns

STRBEL Letters Are you

ROSA There are maids of honorand other maids Giggles

STRBEL Permit me Tapping her forehead lightly with his finger

ROSA Whats the matter

STRBEL Why your heads on fire Blow Blow And while you are getting
some salve for my burns Ill just

     Goes to the telescope

     Enter FRAU VON HALLDORF LIDDY and MILLY FRAU VON HALLDORF
     is an aristocratic woman somewhat supercilious and affected

LIDDY Heres the telescope mother Now you can see for yourself

FRAU V HALLDORF What a pity that its in use just now

STRBEL Stepping back Oh I beg of you ladiesI have plenty of
time I can wait

FRAU V HALLDORF Condescendingly Ah thanks so much She goes up
to the telescope while STRBEL returns to his former place
Waitress Bring us three glasses of milk

LIDDY As MILLY languidly drops into a chair Beyond to the right
is the road mother

FRAU V HALLDORF Oh I have found the road but I see no
carriageneither a royal carriage nor any other sort

LIDDY Let me look

FRAU V HALLDORF Please do

LIDDY It has disappeared now

FRAU V HALLDORF Are you quite sure that it was a royal carriage

LIDDY Oh one has an instinct for that sort of thing mother It comes
to one in the cradle

FRAU V HALLDORF As MILLY yawns and sighs aloud Are you sleepy
dear

MILLY No only tired Im always tired

FRAU V HALLDORF Well thats just why we are at the Springs Do as the
princess does take the waters religiously

MILLY The princess oughtnt to be climbing up such a steep hill either
on a hot day like this

FRAU V HALLDORF More softly Well you know why we are taking all
this trouble If by good luck we should happen to meet the
princess

LIDDY Who has been looking through the telescope Oh there it is
again

FRAU V HALLDORF Eagerly Where Where

     Takes LIDDYS place

LIDDY Its just coming around the turn at the top

FRAU V HALLDORF Oh now I see it Why theres no one inside

LIDDY Well then shes coming up on foot

FRAU V HALLDORF To MILLY See the princess is coming up on foot
too And she is just as anmic as you are

MILLY If I were going to marry a grandduke and if I could have my own
carriage driven along beside me I wouldnt complain of having to walk
either

FRAU V HALLDORF I cant see a thing now

LIDDY You have to turn the screw mother

FRAU V HALLDORF I have been turning it right along but the telescope
wont move

LIDDY Let me try

STRBEL Who has been throwing little wads of paper at ROSA during
the preceding conversation What are they up to

LIDDY It seems to me that youve turned the screw too far mother

FRAU V HALLDORF Well what shall we do about it

STRBEL Rising Permit me to come to your aid ladies Ive had
some experience with these old screws

FRAU V HALLDORF Very kindindeed

     STRBEL busies himself with the instrument

LIDDY Listen mother If the carriage has almost reached the top the
princess cant be far off Wouldnt it be best then to watch for them
on the road

FRAU V HALLDORF Certainly if you think that would be best dear
Liddy

STRBEL This is not only an old screw but its a regular perverted old
screw

FRAU V HALLDORF Ah really Aside to her daughters And if she
should actually speak to us at this accidental meetingand if we could
present ourselves as the subjects of her noble fianc and tell her that
we live at her future homejust imagine what an advantage that would
give us over the other women of the court

STRBEL There ladies We have now rescued the useful instrument to
which the farsightedness of mankind is indebted

FRAU V HALLDORF Thanks so much Pardon me sir but have you heard
anything about the report that the princess is going to make the journey
up here today

STRBEL The princess The princess of the Springs The princess of the
lonely villa The princess who is expected at the iron spring every
morning but who has never been seen by a living soul Why I am
enormously interested You wouldnt believe how much interested I am

LIDDY Who has looked out back Theretherethereit is

FRAU V HALLDORF The carriage

LIDDY Its reached the top already It is stopping over there at the
edge of the woods

FRAU V HALLDORF She will surely enter it there then Come quickly my
dear children so that it will look quite accidental Here is your
money She throws a coin to ROSA and unwraps a small package done up
in tissuepaper which she has brought with her Here is a bouquet for
youand heres one for you You are to present these to the princess

MILLY So that it will look quite accidentaloh yes

     All three go out

STRBEL Good heavens Could I I dont believe it Surely she
sitswell Ill make sure right awayGoes up to the telescope and
stops Oh Ill go along with them anyhow

     Exit after them

FRAU LINDEMANN Entering Have they all goneall of them

ROSA All of them

FRAU LINDEMANN Looking toward the right Theretheretwo ladies
and a lackey are coming up the footpath Mercy me How my heart is
beatingIf I had only had the sofa recovered last springWhat am I
going to say to themRosa dont you know a poem by heart which you
could speak to the princess ROSA shrugs her shoulders Theyre
coming through the court nowStop putting your arms under your apron
that way you stupid thingoh dear oh dear

     The door opens A LACKEY in plain black livery enters and
     remains standing at the door He precedes THE PRINCESS and FRAU
     V BROOK THE PRINCESS is a pale sickly unassuming young girl
     wearing a very simple walking costume and a mediumsized leghorn
     hat trimmed with roses FRAU V BROOK is a handsome stately
     sternlooking woman in the thirties She is welldressed but in
     accordance with the simple tastes of the North German nobility

FRAU V BROOK Who is the proprietor of this place

FRAU LINDEMANN At your command your Highness

FRAU V BROOK Reprovingly I am the maid of honor Where is the
room that has been ordered

moments

THE PRINCESS Very much dear Frau von Brook

FRAU V BROOK Edward order what is needed for Her Highness and see
that a room next to Her Highness is prepared for me I may assume that
these are Your Highnesss wishes

THE PRINCESS Why certainly dear Frau von Brook

THE LACKEY who is carrying shawls and pillows goes out with ROSA
left

THE PRINCESS Mais puisque je te dis Eugnie que je nai pas sommeil
Menvoyer coucher comme une enfant cest abominable

FRAU V BROOK Mais je timplore chrie sois sage Tu sais que cest
le mdecin qui

THE PRINCESS Ah ton mdecin Toujours cette corve Et si je te

FRAU V BROOK Chut My dear woman wouldnt it be best for you to
superintend the preparations

FRAU LINDEMANN I am entirely at your service

     About to go out left

FRAU V BROOK One thing more This veranda leading from the house to
the groundswould it be possible to close it to the public

FRAU LINDEMANN Oh certainly The guests as often as not sit out under
the trees

FRAU V BROOK Very well then do so please FRAU LINDEMANN locks the
door We may be assured that no one will enter this place

FRAU LINDEMANN If it is desired none of us belonging to the house will
come in here either

FRAU V BROOK We should like that

FRAU LINDEMANN Very well Exit

FRAU V BROOK Really you must be more careful darling If that woman
had understood FrenchSPACEYou must be careful

THE PRINCESS What would have been so dreadful about it

FRAU V BROOK Oh my dear child This mood of yours which is due to
nothing but your illnessthat reminds me you havent taken your
peptonized milk yetthis is a secret which we must keep from every one
above all from your fianc If the Grand Duke should discover

THE PRINCESS Shrugging her shoulders Well what of it

FRAU V BROOK A brides duty is to be a happy bride Otherwise

THE PRINCESS Otherwise

FRAU V BROOK She will be a lonely and an unloved woman

THE PRINCESS With a little smile of resignation Ah

FRAU V BROOK What is it dear THE PRINCESS shakes her head And
then think of the strain of those formal presentations awaiting you in
the autumn You must grow strong Remember that you must be equal to the
most exacting demands of life

THE PRINCESS Of life Whose life

FRAU V BROOK What do you mean by that

THE PRINCESS Ah what good does it do to talk about it

FRAU V BROOK Yes you are right In my soul too there are unhappy
and unholy thoughts that I would rather not utter From my own
experience I know that it is best to keep strictly within the narrow
path of duty

THE PRINCESS And to go to sleep

FRAU V BROOK Ah it isnt only that

THE PRINCESS Look out there See the woods Ah to lie down on the
moss to cover oneself with leaves to watch the clouds pass by high
above

FRAU V BROOK Softening We can do that too sometime

THE PRINCESS Laughing aloud Sometime

THE LACKEY appears at the door

FRAU V BROOK Is everything ready

     THE LACKEY bows

THE PRINCESS Aside to FRAU V BROOK But I simply cannot sleep

FRAU V BROOK Try to for my sake Aloud Does Your Highness
command

THE PRINCESS Smiling and sighing Yes I command

     They go out left

     The stage remains empty for several moments Then STRBEL is
     heard trying the latch of the back door

STRBELS VOICE Hullo Whats up Why is this locked all of a sudden
Rosa Open up Ive got to look through the telescope Rosa Wont you
Oh well I know how to help myself He is seen walking outside of the
glasscovered veranda Then he puts his head through the open window at
the right Not a soul inside Climbs over Well here we are What
on earth has happened to these people Unlocks the back door and looks
out Everything deserted Well its all the same to me Locks the
door again But lets find out right away what the carriage has to do
with the case

     Prepares to look through the telescope THE PRINCESS enters
     cautiously through the door at the left her hat in her hand
     Without noticing STRBEL who is standing motionless before the
     telescope she goes hurriedly to the door at the back and unlocks
     it

STRBEL Startled at the sound of the key turns around Why how do
you do THE PRINCESS not venturing to move glances back at the door
through which she has entered Wouldnt you like to look through the
telescope a while Please do THE PRINCESS undecided as to whether or
not she should answer him takes a few steps back toward the door at the
left Why are you going away I wont do anything to you

THE PRINCESS Reassured Oh Im not going away

STRBEL Thats right Butwhere have you come from The door was
locked Surely you didnt climb through the window as I did

THE PRINCESS Frightened What You camethrough the window

STRBEL Of course I did

THE PRINCESS Frightened anew Then I had rather

     About to go back

STRBEL Oh my dear young lady you just stay right here Why before
Id drive you away Id pitch myself headlong over a precipice

THE PRINCESS Smiling reassured I only wanted to go out into the
woods for half an hour

STRBEL Oh then youre a regular guest here at the Inn

THE PRINCESS Quickly Yesyes of course

STRBEL And of course you drink the waters down below

THE PRINCESS In a friendly way Oh yes I drink the waters And
Im taking the baths too

STRBEL Two hundred metres up and down every time Isnt that very hard
on you Heavens And you look so pale See here my dear young lady
dont you do it It would be better for you to go down therethat
isSPACEOh forgive me Ive been talking without thinking Of
course you have your own reasonsSPACEIts decidedly cheaper up
here I know how to value a thing of that sort Ive never had any
money in all my life

THE PRINCESS Trying to seem practical But when one comes to a
wateringplace one must have money

STRBEL Slapping himself on the chest Do I look to you as if I
drank iron Thank Heaven I cant afford such luxuries No Im only a
poor fellow who earns his miserable pittance during vacation by acting
as a private tutorthats to say miserable is only a figure of
speech for in the morning I lie abed until nine at noon I eat five and
at night seven courses and as for work I really havent a thing to do
My pupil is so anmicwhy compared to him youre fit for a circus
rider

THE PRINCESS Laughing unrestrainedly Oh well Im rather glad Im
not one

STRBEL Dear me its a business like any other

THE PRINCESS Like any other Really I didnt think that

STRBEL And pray what did you think then

THE PRINCESS Oh I thought that they werean entirely different sort
of people

STRBEL My dear young lady all people are an entirely different
sort Of course we two arent We get along real well together dont
we As poor as church mice both of us

THE PRINCESS Smiling reflectively Who knows Perhaps thats true

STRBEL Kindly Do you know what If you want to stay down
thereIll tell you how one can live cheaply I have a friend a
student like myself Hes here to mend up as you are I feed him up at
the house where Im staying Frightened at a peculiar look of THE
PRINCESSS Oh but you mustnt beNo I shouldnt have said it It
wasnt decent of me Only let me tell you Im so glad to be able to
help the poor fellow out of my unexpected earnings that Id like to be
shouting it from the housetops all the time Of course you understand
that dont you

THE PRINCESS You like to help people then

STRBEL Surelydont you

THE PRINCESS Reflecting No Theres always so much talk about it
and the whole thing immediately appears in the newspapers

STRBEL What If you help some one that appears

THE PRINCESS Quietly correcting herself I only mean if one takes
part in entertainments for charity

STRBEL Oh yes naturally In those things they always get some woman
of rank to act as patroness if they can and she sees to it you may be
sure that the newspapers make a fuss over it

THE PRINCESS Demurely Oh not every

STRBEL Just try to teach me something I dont know about these titled
women Besides my dear young lady where is your homein one of the
large cities or

THE PRINCESS Oh no In quite a small townreally more like the
country

STRBEL Then Im going to show you something that you probably never
saw before in all your life

THE PRINCESS Oh do What is it

STRBEL A princess Hmnot a makebelieve but a real trueblue
princess

THE PRINCESS Oh really

STRBEL Yes Our Princess of the Springs

THE PRINCESS And who may that be

STRBEL Why Princess Marie Louise

THE PRINCESS Of Geldern

STRBEL Of course

THE PRINCESS Do you know her

STRBEL Why certainly

THE PRINCESS Really I thought that she lived in great retirement

STRBEL Well that doesnt do her any good Not a bit of it And
because you are such a jolly good fellow Im going to tell you my
secret Im in love with this princess

THE PRINCESS Oh

STRBEL You cant imagine what a comfort it is The fact is every
young poet has got to have a princess to love

THE PRINCESS Are you a poet

STRBEL Cant you tell that by looking at me

THE PRINCESS I never saw a poet before

STRBEL Never saw a poetnever saw a princess Why youre learning a
heap of things today

THE PRINCESS Assenting Hmand have you written poems to her

STRBEL Why that goes without saying Quantities of em

THE PRINCESS Oh please recite some little thingwont you

STRBEL No not yet Everything at the proper time

THE PRINCESS Ah yes first I should like to see the princess

STRBEL No first I am going to tell you the whole story

THE PRINCESS Oh yes yes Please do Sits down

STRBEL Well thenI had hardly heard that she was here before I was
dead in love with her It was just as quick as a shot I tell you Just
as if I had waited all my life long to fall in love with her Besides I
also heard about her beautyand her sorrow You see she had an early
love affair

THE PRINCESS Disconcerted What Are they saying that

STRBEL Yes It was a young officer who went to Africa because of
herand died there

THE PRINCESS And they know that too

STRBEL What dont they know But thats a mere detailit doesnt
concern me Even the fact that in six months she will become the bride
of a granddukeeven that can make no difference to me For the present
she is my princess But youre not listening to me

THE PRINCESS Oh yes I am

STRBEL Do you know what that meansmy princess Ill not give up
my princessnot for anything in all the world

THE PRINCESS Butif you dont even know her

STRBEL I dont know her Why I know her as well as I know myself

THE PRINCESS Have you ever met her then

STRBEL I dont know of any one who has ever met her And theres not a
soul that can tell what she looks like It is said that there were
pictures of her in the shopwindows when she first came but they were
removed immediately In the morning a great many people are always
lurking around the Springs trying to catch a glimpse of her I myself
have gotten up at six oclock a couple of timeson the same errandand
if you knew me better youd realize what that meant But not a sign of
her Either she has the stuff brought to her house or she has the power
of making herself invisible THE PRINCESS turns aside to conceal a
smile After that I used to hang around her gardenevery day for
hours at a time Until one day the policeman whom the managers of the
Springs have stationed at the gates came up to me and asked me what on
earth I was doing there Well that was the end of those methods of
approach Suddenly however a happy thought struck me Now I can see
her and have her near to me as often as I wish

THE PRINCESS Why thats very interesting How

STRBEL Yes thats just the point Hm should I risk it Should I
take you into my confidence

THE PRINCESS You promised me some time ago that you would show her to
me

STRBEL Wait a second Looks through the telescope There she is
Please look for yourself

THE PRINCESS But I amShe too looks through the telescope
Actually there is the garden as plain as if one were in it

STRBEL And at the corner window on the leftwith the
embroideryframethats she

THE PRINCESS Are you absolutely certain that that is the princess

STRBEL Why who else could it be

THE PRINCESS Oh round about a princess like thatthere are such a
lot of people For instance there is her waitingwoman theres the
seamstress and her assistants theres

STRBEL But my dear young lady if you only understood anything about
these matters you would have been certain at the very first glance that
it was sheand no one else Observe the nobility in every motionthe
queenly grace with which she bends over the embroideryframe

THE PRINCESS How do you know that its an embroideryframe

STRBEL Why what should a princess be bending over if not an
embroideryframe Do you expect her to be darning stockings

THE PRINCESS It wouldnt hurt her at all

STRBEL Now thats just one of those petty bourgeois notions which we
ought to suppress Its not enough that we have to stick in this
misery but wed like to drag her down toothat being far above all
earthly care

THE PRINCESS Oh dear me

STRBEL What are you sighing about so terribly

THE PRINCESS Tell me wouldnt you like to have a closer acquaintance
with your princess some time

STRBEL Closer Why should I Isnt she close enough to me my faraway
princessfor thats what I call her when I talk to myself about her
And to have her still closer

THE PRINCESS Why so that you could talk to her and know what she
really was like

STRBEL Terrified Talk to her Heaven forbid Goodness gracious
no Just see herehow am I to face a princess Im an ordinary fellow
the son of poor folks I havent polished mannersI havent even a
decent tailor A lady like thatwhy shed measure me from top to toe
in one glance Ive had my lessons in the fine houses where Ive applied
as tutor A glance from boots to cravatand youre dismissed

THE PRINCESS And you think that Icorrecting herself that this
girl is as superficial as that

STRBEL This girl Dear me how that sounds But how should I ever
succeed in showing her my real self And even if I should what would
she care Oh yes if she were like youso nice and simpleand with
such a kindhearted roguish little twinkle in her eye

THE PRINCESS RoguishI Why so

STRBEL Because you are laughing at me in your sleeve And really I
deserve nothing better

THE PRINCESS But your princess deserves something better than your
opinion of her

STRBEL How do you know that

THE PRINCESS You really ought to try to become acquainted with her some
time

STRBEL No no noand again no As long as she remains my faraway
princess she is everything that I want her to bemodest gracious
loving She smiles upon me dreamily Yes she even listens when I recite
my poems to herand that cant be said of many people And as soon as I
have finished she sighs takes a rose from her breast and casts it down
to the poet I wrote a few verses yesterday about that rose that flower
which represents the pinnacle of my desires as it were

THE PRINCESS Eagerly Oh yes Oh please please

STRBEL Well then here goes Hm

    Twenty roses nestling close

THE PRINCESS What Are there twenty now

STRBEL Severely My princess would not have interrupted me

THE PRINCESS Oh pleaseforgive me

STRBEL I shall begin again

    Twenty roses nestling close
      Gleam upon thy breast
    Twenty years of rosered love
      Upon thy fair cheeks rest

    Twenty years would I gladly give
      Out of lifes brief reign
    Could I but ask a rose of thee
      And ask it not in vain

    Twenty roses thou dost not need
      Why pearls and rubies are thine
    With nineteen thoudst be just as fair
      And one would then be mine

    And twenty years of rosewreathed joy
      Would spring to life for me
    Yet twenty years could neer suffice
      To worship itand thee

THE PRINCESS How nice that is Ive never had any verses written to me
b

STRBEL Ah my dear young lady ordinary folks like us have to do their
own versemaking

THE PRINCESS And all for one rose Dear me how soon it fades And then
what is left you

STRBEL No my dear friend a rose like that never fadeseven as my
love for the gracious giver can never die

THE PRINCESS But you havent even got it yet

STRBEL That makes no difference in the end Im entirely independent
of such externals When some day I shall be explaining Ovid to the
beginners or perhaps even reading Horace with the more advanced
classesno its better for the present not to think of reaching any
such dizzy heights of greatnesswell then I shall always be saying to
myself with a smile of satisfaction You too were one of those
confounded artist fellowswhy you once went so far as to love a
princess

THE PRINCESS And that will make you happy

STRBEL Enormously For what makes us happy after all A bit of
happiness Great heavens no Happiness wears out like an old glove

THE PRINCESS Well then what does

STRBEL Ah how should I know Any kind of a dreama fancya wish
unfulfilleda sorrow that we coddlesome nothing which suddenly
becomes everything to us I shall always say to my pupils Young men
if you want to be happy as long as you live create gods for yourselves
in your own image these gods will take care of your happiness

The Princess And what would the god be like that you would create

STRBEL Would be Is my dear young lady is A man of the world
a gentleman wellbred smiling enjoying lifewho looks out upon
mankind from under bushy eyebrows who knows Nietzsche and Stendhal by
heart andpointing to his shoes who isnt down at the heelsa
god in short worthy of my princess I know perfectly well that all my
life long I shall never do anything but crawl around on the ground like
an industrious ant but I know too that the god of my fancy will
always take me by the collar when the proper moment comes and pull me up
again into the clouds Yes up there Im safe And your god or rather
your goddesswhat would she look like

THE PRINCESS Thoughtfully Thats not easy to say My goddess would
bea quiet peaceful woman who would treasure a secret little joy like
the apple of her eye who would know nothing of the world except what
she wanted to know and who would have the strength to make her own
choice when it pleased her

STRBEL But that doesnt seem to me a particularly lofty aspiration my
dear young lady

THE PRINCESS Lofty as the heavens my friend

STRBEL My princess would be of a different opinion

THE PRINCESS Do you think so

STRBEL For thats merely the ideal of every little country girl

THE PRINCESS Not her idealher daily life which she counts as naught
It is my ideal because I can never attain it

STRBEL Oh I say my dear young girl It cant be as bad as that A
young girl like youso charming andI dont want to be forward but if
I could only help you a bit

THE PRINCESS Have you got to be helping all the time Before it was
only a cheap lunch now its actually

STRBEL Yes yes Im an awful donkey I know but

THE PRINCESS Smiling Dont say any more about it dear friend I
like you that way

STRBEL Feeling oppressed by her superiority Really you are an
awfully strange person Theres something about you thatthat

THE PRINCESS Well

STRBEL I cant exactly define it Tell me werent you wanting to go
into the woods before Its soso oppressive in here

THE PRINCESS Oppressive I dont find it so at allquite the contrary

STRBEL No noIm restless I dont know whatat all events may I
not escort you One can chat more freely one can express himself more
openlyif one

     Takes a deep breath

THE PRINCESS Smiling And you are leaving your faraway princess
with such a light heart

STRBEL Carelessly Oh she She wont run away Shell be sitting
there tomorrow againand the day after too

THE PRINCESS And so that is your great undying love

STRBEL Yes but when a girl like you comes across ones path

FRAU V HALLDORF Hurrying in and then drawing back in feigned
astonishment Oh

LIDDY AND MILLY Similarly Oh

STRBEL Well ladies didnt I tell you that you wouldnt find her
Princesses dont grow along the roadside like weeds

FRAU V HALLDORF Disregarding himceremoniously The infinite
happiness with which this glorious event fills our hearts must excuse in
some measure the extraordinary breach of good manners which we are
committing in daring to address Your Highness But as the fortunate
subjects of Your Highnesss most noble fianc we could not refrain
from

STRBEL Well well Whats all this

FRAU V HALLDORFfrom offering to our eagerly awaited sovereign a
slight token of our future loyalty Liddy Milly LIDDY and MILLY
come forward and with low court bows offer their bouquets My
daughters respectfully present these few flowers to the illustrious
princess

STRBEL I beg your pardon but who is doing the joking here you
or

     FRAU V BROOK enters THE PRINCESS taken unawares has
     retreated more and more helplessly toward the door at the left
     undecided whether to take flight or remain She greets the arrival
     of FRAU V BROOK with a happy sigh of relief

FRAU V BROOK Severely Pardon me ladies Apparently you have not
taken the proper steps toward being presented to Her Highness In
matters of this sort one must first apply to me I may be addressed
every morning from eleven to twelve and I shall be happy to consider
your desires

FRAU V HALLDORF With dignity I and my children madame were
aware of the fact that we were acting contrary to the usual procedure
but the impulse of loyal hearts is guided by no rule I shall be glad to
avail myself of yourvery kind invitation

     All three go out with low curtsies to THE PRINCESS

FRAU V BROOK What forwardness But how could you come down without me
And what is that young man over there doing Does he belong to those
people

     THE PRINCESS shakes her head STRBEL without a word goes to
     get his hat which has been lying on a chair bows abruptly and is
     about to leave

THE PRINCESS Oh no That wouldnt be nice Not that way

FRAU V BROOK Amazed What What Why Your Highness

THE PRINCESS Let me be Eugenie This young man and I have become far
too good friends to part in such an unfriendly yes almost hostile
fashion

FRAU V BROOK Your Highness I am very much

THE PRINCESS To STRBEL You and I will certainly remember this
hour with great pleasure and I thank you for it with all my heart If I
only had a rose with me so as to give you your dear wish Eugenie
havent we any roses with us

FRAU V BROOK Your Highness I am very much

THE PRINCESS Examining herself and searching among the vases Well
how are we going to manage it

STRBEL I most humbly thankyour Highnessfor the kind intention

THE PRINCESS No nowait Her glance falls upon the hat which she is
holding in her handwith a sudden thought I have it But dont think
that Im joking And well have to do without scissors She tears one
of the roses from the hat I dont know whether there are just
twentyHolding out one of the roses to him Well This rose has the
merit of being just as real as the sentiment of which we were speaking
beforeand just as unfading

STRBEL Is thisto bemy punishment THE PRINCESS smilingly shakes
her head Or does your Highness mean by it that only the Unreal never
fades

THE PRINCESS Thats exactly what I meanbecause the Unreal must always

FRAU V BROOK Permit me to remark Your Highnessthat it is high

THE PRINCESS Well I told you that I wasnt sleepy

THE STRONGER

BY

AUGUST STRINDBERG


AUGUST STRINDBERG

August Strindberg Swedens foremost dramatist was born at Stockholm in
 He attended the University of Upsala but did not graduate In 
he wrote Master Olaf which was for six years steadily refused by
managers When it did appear it inaugurated the Swedish dramatic
renascence By turns Strindberg was schoolmaster journalist dramatist
writer of scientific and political treatises and writer of short
stories In  he left Sweden and travelled extensively in Denmark
Germany France and Italy He died in 

As a dramatist Strindbergs chief strength lies not so much in dramatic
technique as it does in his trenchant and searching power of analysis of
the human mind His chief plays are very exact and narrow views of the
feminine soul Some of his own domestic bitterness finds expression in
the feminine studies in his plays He is very fond of showing the power
of one character over another

His important oneact plays are The Outlaw Countess Julie
Creditors Pariah Facing Death and The Stronger The
Stronger has a dramatic intensity that few plays possess Though but
one character speaks the souls of three are skilfully laid bare


PERSONS

    MRS X an actress married
    MISS Y an actress unmarried




THE STRONGERM


     SCENE A corner of a ladies restaurant two small tables of
     castiron a sofa covered with red plush and a few chairs

     MRS X enters dressed in hat and winter coat and carrying a
     pretty Japanese basket on her arm

     MISS Y has in front of her a partly emptied bottle of beer she
     is reading an illustrated weekly and every now and then she
     exchanges it for a new one

MRS X Well how do Millie Here you are sitting on Christmas Eve as
lonely as a poor bachelor

     MISS Y looks up from the paper for a moment nods and resumes
     her reading

MRS X Really I feel sorry to find you like thisalonealone in a
restaurant and on Christmas Eve of all times It makes me as sad as
when I saw a wedding party at Paris once in a restaurantthe bride was
reading a comic paper and the groom was playing billiards with the
witnesses Ugh when it begins that way I thought how will it end
Think of it playing billiards on his wedding day Yes and youre going
to say that she was reading a comic paper thats a different case my
dear

     A waitress brings a cup of chocolate places it before MRS X
     and disappears again

MRS X Sips a few spoonfuls opens the basket and displays a number
of Christmas presents See what Ive bought for my tots Picks up a
doll What do you think of this Lisa is to have it She can roll her
eyes and twist her head do you see Fine is it not And heres a cork
pistol for Carl

     Loads the pistol and pops it at MISS Y MISS Y starts as if
     frightened

MRS X Did I scare you Why you didnt fear I was going to shoot you
did you Really I didnt think you could believe that of me If you
were to shoot mewell that wouldnt surprise me the least Ive got
in your way once and I know youll never forget itbut I couldnt help
it You still think I intrigued you away from the Royal Theatre and I
didnt do anything of the kindalthough you think so But it doesnt
matter what I say of courseyou believe it was I just the same
Pulls out a pair of embroidered slippers Well these are for my
hubbytulipsIve embroidered them myself HmI hate tulipsand he
must have them on everything

     MISS Y looks up from the paper with an expression of mingled
     sarcasm and curiosity

MRS X Puts a hand in each slipper Just see what small feet Bob
has See And you should see him walkelegant Of course youve never
seen him in slippers

     MISS Y laughs aloud

MRS X Look herehere he comes

     Makes the slippers walk across the table MISS Y laughs
     again

MRS X Then he gets angry and he stamps his foot just like this
Blame that cook who cant learn how to make coffee Or The
idiotnow that girl has forgotten to fix my study lamp again Then
there is a draught through the floor and his feet get cold Gee but
its freezing and those blanked idiots dont even know enough to keep
the house warm

     She rubs the sole of one slipper against the instep of the
     other MISS Y breaks into prolonged laughter

MRS X And then he comes home and has to hunt for his slippersMary
has pushed them under the bureau Well perhaps it is not right to be
making fun of ones own husband Hes pretty good for all thata real
dear little hubby thats what he is You should have such a
husbandwhat are you laughing at Cant you tell Then you see I know
he is faithful Yes I know for he has told me himselfwhat in the
world makes you giggle like that That nasty Betty tried to get him away
from me while I was on the road Can you think of anything more
infamous Pause But Id have scratched the eyes out of her face
thats what Id have done if I had been at home when she tried it
Pause Im glad Bob told me all about it so I didnt have to hear
it first from somebody else Pause And just think of it Betty was
not the only one I dont know why it is but all women seem to be crazy
after my husband It must be because they imagine his government
position gives him something to say about the engagements Perhaps
youve tried it yourselfyou may have set your traps for him too Yes
I dont trust you very farbut I know he never cared for youand then
I have been thinking you rather had a grudge against him

     Pause They look at each other in an embarrassed manner

MRS X Amelia spend the evening with us wont you Just to show that
you are not angrynot with me at least I cannot tell exactly why but
it seems so awfully unpleasant to have youyoufor an enemy Perhaps
because I got in your way that time rallentando orI dont
knowreally I dont know at all

     Pause MISS Y gazes searchingly at MRS X

MRS X Thoughtfully It was so peculiar the way our
acquaintancewhy I was afraid of you when I first met you so afraid
that I did not dare to let you out of sight It didnt matter where I
tried to goI always found myself near you I didnt have the courage
to be your enemyand so I became your friend But there was always
something discordant in the air when you called at our home for I saw
that my husband didnt like youand it annoyed mejust as it does when
a dress wont fit Ive tried my very best to make him appear friendly
to you at least but I couldnt move himnot until you were engaged
Then you two became such fast friends that it almost looked as if you
had not dared to show your real feelings before when it was not
safeand laterlet me see now I didnt get jealousstrange was it
not And I remember the baptismyou were acting as godmother and I
made him kiss youand he did but both of you looked terribly
embarrassedthat is I didnt think of it thenor afterwards evenI
never thought of ittillnow Rises impulsively Why dont you
say something You have not uttered a single word all this time Youve
just let me go on talking Youve been sitting there staring at me only
and your eyes have drawn out of me all these thoughts which were lying
in me like silk in a cocoonthoughtsbad thoughts maybelet me think
Why did you break your engagement Why have you never called on us
afterward Why dont you want to be with us tonight

     MISS Y makes a motion as if intending to speak

MRS X No you dont need to say anything at all All is clear to me
now So thats the reason of it all Yes yes Everything fits together
now Shame on you I dont want to sit at the same table with you
Moves her things to another table Thats why I must put those
hateful tulips on his slippersbecause you love them Throws the
slippers on the floor Thats why we have to spend the summer in the
mountainsbecause you cant bear the salt smell of the ocean thats
why my boy had to be called Eskilbecause that was your fathers name
thats why I had to wear your color and read your books and eat your
favorite dishes and drink your drinksthis chocolate for instance
thats whygreat heavensits terrible to think of itits terrible
Everything was forced on me by youeven your passions Your soul bored
itself into mine as a worm into an apple and it ate and ate and
burrowed and burrowed till nothing was left but the outside shell and a
little black dust I wanted to run away from you but I couldnt You
were always on hand like a snake with your black eyes to charm meI
felt how my wings beat the air only to drag me downI was in the water
with my feet tied together and the harder I worked with my arms the
further down I wentdown down till I sank to the bottom where you
lay in wait like a monster crab to catch me with your clawsand now Im
there Shame on you How I hate you hate you hate you But you you
just sit there silent and calm and indifferent whether the moon is new
or full whether its Christmas or midsummer whether other people are
happy or unhappy You are incapable of hatred and you dont know how to
love As a cat in front of a mousehole you are sitting there You
cant drag your prey out and you cant pursue it but you can outwait
it Here you sit in this comerdo you know theyve nicknamed it the
mousetrap on your account Here you read the papers to see if anybody
is in trouble or if anybody is about to be discharged from the theatre
Here you watch your victims and calculate your chances and take your
tributes Poor Amelia Do you know I pity you all the same for I know
you are unhappyunhappy as one who has been wounded and malicious
because you are wounded I ought to be angry with you but really I
cantyou are so small after alland as to Bob why that does not
bother me in the least What does it matter to me anyhow If you or
somebody else taught me to drink chocolatewhat of that Takes a
spoonful of chocolate then sententiously They say chocolate is very
wholesome And if I have learned from you how to dresstant
mieuxit has only given me a stronger hold on my husbandand you
have lost where I have gained Yes judging by several signs I think
you have lost him already Of course you meant me to break with himas
you did and as you are now regrettingbut you see I never would do
that It wouldnt do to be narrowminded you know And why should I
take only what nobody else wants Perhaps after all I am the stronger
now You never got anything from me you merely gaveand thus happened
to me what happened to the thiefI had what you missed when you woke
up How explain in any other way that in your hand everything proved
worthless and useless You were never able to keep a mans love in
spite of your tulips and your passionsand I could you could never
learn the art of living from the booksas I learned it you bore no
little Eskil although that was your fathers name And why do you keep
silent always and everywheresilent ever silent I used to think it
was because you were so strong and maybe the simple truth was you never
had anything to saybecause you were unable to think Rises and picks
up the slippers Im going home nowIll take the tulips with
meyour tulips You couldnt learn anything from others you couldnt
bendand so you broke like a dry stemand I didnt Thank you
Amelia for all your instructions I thank you that you have taught me
how to love my husband Now Im going hometo him Exit
