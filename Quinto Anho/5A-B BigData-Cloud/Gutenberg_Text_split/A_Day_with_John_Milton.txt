A DAY WITH JOHN MILTON


About four oclock on a September morning of when the sun was
not yet shining upon his windows facing the Artillery Fields and the
autumnal dew lay wet upon his garden leavesJohn Milton awoke with
his customary punctuality and true to his austere and abstemious mode
of life wasted no time over comfortable indolence He rose and
proceeded to dress with the help of his manservant Greene For
although he was but fiftyfour years in age his hands were partly
crippled with gout and chalkstones and his eyes clear bright and blue
as they had always been to outward seeming were both stoneblind

Milton still retained much of that personal comeliness which had won
him at Cambridge the nickname of Lady of Christs College His
original red and white had now become a uniform pallor his thick
light brown hair parted at the top and curling richly on his
shouldersno closecropt Roundhead thiswas beginning to fade
towards grey But his features were noble and symmetrical he was
wellbuilt and wellproportioned and he was justified in priding
himself upon a personal appearance which he had never neglected or
despised In his own words he was neither large nor small at no time
had he been considered ugly and in youth with a sword by his side he
had never feared the bravest

Such was the man who now neatly dressed in black was led into his
study upon the same floor as his bedrooma small chamber hung with
rusty greenand there seated in a large old elbowchair received the
morning salutations of his three daughters

One after another they entered the room and each bestowed a
characteristic greeting upon her father Anne the eldest a handsome
girl of twenty was lame and had a slight impediment in her speech She
bade him goodmorning with a stammering carelessness enquired casually
as to his nights rest and stared out of window palpably bored at the
commencement of another monotonous irksome day Mary the second
dark impetuous and impatientwas in a state of smouldering
rebellion She addressed him in a tone of almost insolent mockcivility
he must needs have been deaf as well as blind not to detect the
unfilial dislike beneath her words Tenyearold Deborah the most
affectionate of the three ventured to kiss her father even to stroke
his long beautiful hair and to retie the tassels of his collar

Mary will read to me this morning said Milton gravely inclining his
head in acknowledgment of Deborahs attentions The dark girl with a
mutinous shrug of her shoulders sat down and began to read aloud in a
hard uninterested voice out of the great leatherbound Hebrew Old
Testament which lay upon the table And not one single sentence did she
understandnot one word of what she was reading

John Miltons theories of education which he had expounded at length in
pamphlets were a curious blend of the practical and the ideal Vastly
in advance of his time in his demand for a practical training he had
evolved that fine definition which has never been improved uponI
call a complete and generous education that which fits a man to perform
justly skilfully and magnanimously all the offices both private and
public of peace and war But he made no allowances for slowness or
stupidity all his schemes were based upon the existence of scholars
equally gifted with himself And he entirely left out of all
calculations much as a Mahommedan might that complex organism the
female mind He wished it one must conjecture to remain a blank So
his daughters had received no systematic schooling only some sort of
homeinstruction from a governess And he had himself trained them to
read aloud in five or six languagesFrench Italian Latin Greek
Hebrew and even Syriacin total ignorance of the meaning
One tongue observed Milton brusquely almost brutally is enough
for any woman

Mary read on steadily stolidly sullenly for a full hour The others
had left the room and were busy upon household tasks At the conclusion
of two chapters Leave me commanded Milton I would be alone now for
contemplationand Mary willingly escaped to breakfast

The great poet reclined in his chairwrapt in such solemn and
melancholy meditation as might have served as the model for his own
Penseroso A severe composure suffused his fine features a serious
sadness looked out of his unclouded eyes his entire expression was
that of English intrepidity mixed with unutterable sorrow For Milton
was a bitterly disappointed man

It was not merely his comparative povertybecause the Restoration
besides depriving him of his post as Latin or Foreign Secretary to the
Commonwealth Council of State had reduced his means from various
sources almost to vanishing point

Nor was his melancholy mainly the result of his affliction that he had
deliberately incurred and was as deliberately enduring Constant
headaches late study and perpetual recourse to one nostrum after
another had eventuated in the certainty of total blindness if he
persisted in his mode of work

    The choice lay before me between dereliction of a supreme duty and
     loss of eyesight  and I therefore concluded to employ the
     little remaining eyesight I was to enjoy in doing this the
     greatest service to the common weal it was in my power to render

No it was not a personal matter which could sadden John Milton to the
very roots of his stern ambitious courageous soul It was the
contravention of all that he held most dear in lifethe frustration
as he conceived it of that liberty which was his very hearts blood by
the Restoration of the Stuart monarchy He had resolved in his own
words to transfer into the struggle for liberty all my genius and all
the strength of my industry It appeared that he had flung away both
in vain The Stuart monarchy to him lay monstrously black
overshadowing all the land like his own conception of Satan

The Restoration was not merely the political defeat of his party it was
the total defeat of the principles of the religious and social ideals
with which Miltons life was bound up He had always stood aloof from
the other salient men of the time Of Cromwell he had practically no
personal knowledge with the bulk of the Presbyterians he was openly at
enmity Shut away behind a barrier of his own ideas he did not care
to associate with men of less lofty intellectual standing But now he
was even more isolated Since the downfall of the Puritan rgime he of
necessity stood alone and became the party himself And he presented
in his Samson Agonistes the intensest utterance of the most intense
of English poetsthe agonised cry of the beaten party condensed into
the expression of one unflinching and heroic soul

Upon the mysterious and inscrutable decrees of Providence which had
laid in the dust what seemed to him the very cause of God Milton sat
and pondered in a despondency so profound a disappointment so
poignant that his own great lines had sought in vain to voice it

     I feel my genial spirits droop
    My hopes all flat Nature within me seems
    In all her functions weary of herself
    My race of glory run and race of shame
    And I shall shortly be with them that rest

                          Samson Agonistes

Yet his indomitable spirit was by no means quenched in despair and an
outlet was now open to him at last which for eighteen years he had
foregonethe outlet of poetic expression He was conscious of his
capacity to travel and to traverse the regions which none had dared
explore save Dante And with that tremendous chief of pioneers he was
measuring himself man to man

He was able above the turmoil of faction and the tumult of conflicting
troubles to weigh

     his spread wings at leisure to behold
    Far off the empyreal Heaven extended wide
    In circuit undetermined square or round
    With opal towers and battlements adorned
    Of living sapphire once his native seat

                           Paradise Lost

That Milton had been silent for so long a period was due firstly to his
preoccupation with political and polemical questions into which he had
thrown the whole weight of his mind and secondly to the effect of his
own firm resolve that the great epic which he had always secretly
intended should be the outcome of matured and ripened powers the
apotheosis of all that was worthiest in him the full fruit of his
strenuous life He had long since arrived at that conclusion never
surpassed in its terseness and truth that true poetry must be simple
sensuous impassionedwords which might serve as the text and
touchstone of art And long it was not after when he

    was confirmed in this opinion that he who would not be frustrate of
     his hope to write well hereafter in laudable things ought himself to
     be a true poem

For poetry to John Milton was no sounding brass or tinkling cymbal in
his hand the thing became a trumpet apt to seraphic usages and the
rallying of celestial cohorts

Therefore when he ceased to touch the tender stops of various quills
that trembled into silence in Lycidas it was not as one discomfited
of his attainment Rather it was as one convinced of a mighty purpose
and patiently awaiting the just time of its fulfilment The woodnotes
wild of Comus the exquisitely stippled genre painting of
Allegro and Penseroso were mere childish attempts compared with
that monumental work to which Milton firmly proposed to devote the
fruition of his genius And now having become a man through mental and
physical experience even more than through the passage of years he had
put away childish things He had resolved at last upon and had at last
undertaken the one subject most congenial to his taste and most
suitable to his style and diction Paradise Lost was the triumphant
offspring of his brain It had sprung like light from chaos Out of
the darkness of poverty blindness and defeat arose the poem which was
to set him on the pinnacles of Parnassus

You make many enquiries as to what I am about he wrote in bygone years to
his old schoolfellow Charles Diodati What am I thinking of Why with
Gods help of immortality Forgive the word I only whisper it in your
ear Yes I am pluming my wings for a flight Nor was this the idle
boasting of an egotist the empty imagination of a dreamer

Consumed by the desire of honour and repute and universal fame
seated as he put it in the breast of every true scholar Milton
sedulously and assiduously had prepared himself for the achievement of
his aims That he should strictly meditate the thankless Muse required
a certain selfcontrol To scorn delights and live laborious days is
not the customary delight of a handsome young scholar expert in
swordsmanship as in languages To equip himself for his selfchosen
task still a misty undefined prospect in the remotest future required
strenuous and disciplined study and necessitated his forgoing too
frequently the scenes of rustic happiness which he had pictured so
charmingly in LAllegroabsenting himself from The groves and
ruins and the beloved village elms  where I too among rural scenes
and remote forests seemed as if I could have grown and vegetated
through a hidden eternity

And this though Milton had neither the eye nor the ear of a born
naturelover was in itself a sufficient deprivation and sacrifice For
beauty appealed to him with a most earnest insistenceand the purer
the more abstract form it took the more urgent was that appeal God
has instilled into me at all events he declared a vehement love of
the beautiful Not with so much labour is Ceres said to have sought
Proserpine as I am wont day and night to search for the idea of the
beautiful through all forms and faces of things and to follow it
leading me on with certain assured traces

Yet not alone among forms and faces was he predestined to discover
that Absolute Beauty The passionate love of music so frequently
characteristic of a great linguist which led him into soundworlds as
well as sightworlds was fated to remain with him an incalculable
consolation when forms and faces could be no more seen And into the
vocabulary of Paradise Lost that incomparably rich vocabulary with
its infallible ear for rhythm for phrase for magnificent consonantal
effects and the magic of great names that reverberate through open
vowelsinto this he poured forth his whole sense of beautiful sound

         as the wakeful bird
    Sings darkling and in shadiest covert hid
    Tunes her nocturnal note

Paradise Lost remains as has been observed The elaborated outcome
of all the best words of all antecedent poetrythe language of one who
lives in the companionship of the great and the wise of all past time
equally magnificent in verbiage whether describing man or God or the
ArchEnemy visiting this pendent world when

    Thither full fraught with mischievous revenge
    Accursed and in a cursed hour he lives

At seven oclock the bodyservant Greene reentered followed by Mrs
Milton the poets third wife and by Mary Fisher their maidservant
bringing in his breakfast a light slight repast Mrs Milton ne
Elizabeth Minshull of Nantwich was a comely active capable woman
of a peaceful and agreeable humour so far at least as her husband was
concerned for she shared the traditional destiny of a stepmother in not
hitting it off with the first wifes daughters Her golden hair and
calm commonsense were in striking contrast alike with the dark beauty
and petulant spirit of Mary Powell and with the fragile sweetness of
Catherine Woodcock Miltons former spouses If she did not in her heart
confirm her husbands celebrated theory of the relative position of man
and wifeHe for God only she for God in himwhich it has been
said condenses every fallacy about womans true relation to her
husband and to her Maker she managed very adroitly to convey an
impression of entire acquiescence in the will of her lord And at least
she was entirely adequate as a housewife

Had Milton ever encountered that not impossible She whom he portrayed
in his ideal Eve or was this latter a mere visionary abstract of great
qualities to show us how divine a thing a woman may be made Neither
of his three wives nor yet that very handsome and witty gentlewoman
Miss Davis to whom he had at one time paid his addresses conformed to
this description one cannot even conjecture that it was a pasticcio
of their respective fine attributes

Mrs Milton third of that name as she bustled and busied herself about
the study was by no means a new Eve She regarded her husbands
ambitions and achievements with that good natured tolerance so
characteristic of the materiallyminded Only genius can appreciate
genius and the man who shut himself away from his confrres in
scholarship and literature was not likely to unbosom himself to his
housewifely provincial wife

The manservant Greene breakfast being concluded read aloud or wrote
to his masters dictation for some hours This had formerly been the
girls daily office but they were revolting more and morethe whole
position was becoming untenable for they resented the presence of their
stepmother as much as they disliked the duties which fettered them to
their fathers side and forced them to parrotlike futile drudgery in
unknown tongues Today however Greene was relieved of the task for
which he was manifestly but illfitted by the entrance of Miltons two
favourite visitors

No celebrity ever had fewer friends From all who might have called
themselves such he was separated by hostility of party rancour of
sect or by that almost repellent isolation of character to which
reference has already been made When at the highest of his political
fame he had almost boasted himself of this splendid isolationI
have very little acquaintance with those in power inasmuch as I keep
very much to my own house and prefer to do so At heart a Republican
beyond the conception of any Roundheadcherishing a form of religion
so recondite that it could be classed under no heading since he ignored
both public worship and family prayerhaving given offence to all and
sundry by his outspoken theories upon divorce and divine rightMilton
presented to most men a dangerous personality And most of all now when
the wits of the Restoration rous could be sharpened upon him and when
the heathen as he considered them roistered and ruffled it through the
city that had returned to her wallowing in the mire

Yet those who had sat at his feet as pupils retained a singular
affection for their former master For all such young folk as adopted
the disciples attitude the stern selfcontained man had a very soft
spot in his heart With such he was not only instructive but genial
almost cheerful and they alone could move him to the only utterances
which were neither solemn serious or sad Chief among his former
pupils were those who now made entranceHenry Lawrence and Cyriac
Skinner

It may be guessed therefore with what pleasure the blind poet received
these loyal and affectionate men His pensive face became transformed
with interest and animation as with gentle courtesy and unfeigned
delight he turned his sightless eyes from one speaker to another Upon
every subject he had a ready flow of easy colloquial conversation
seasoned with shrewd satire his deep and musical voice ran up and down
the whole gamut of worthy topics Sometimes he fell into the stately
almost stilted diction of his great prose pamphletssometimes he spoke
in racy English vernacularsometimes warming to his subject he
assumed an almost fiery eloquence But when at twelve oclock he was
escorted downstairs to dinner in the parlour the metamorphosis was
complete This was no longer the brooding introspective man of the early
morning but one extreme pleasant in his conversation almost merry in
society so congenialthe life of the party abstinent but not ascetic
having a healthy human enjoyment of the dishes set before him

These are the victuals most to my liking he observed as he ate
being seasonable and withal of no great cost For that which is of great
rarity or richness and must be procured with care or toil hath no
temptation for me

I do always my best Mr Milton replied his wife that you shall be
well satisfied and methinks today I have hit your taste right fairly

God ha mercy Betty said Milton regarding her with an air of kindly
tolerance I see thou wilt perform according to thy promise in providing
me such dishes as I think fit while I live and when I die thou knowest
I have left thee all Here Anne Mary and Deborah sat up very straight
and directed looks of fury and astonishment towards their stepmother

Talk not o dying in Gods name man responded the embarrassed Betty
we have enough to do to make shift to live nowadays and she hastily
pressed her good but simple fare homely Cheshire dishes wellprepared
upon the two guests Such a many learned foreign folk have visited our
poor house these latter daystime hath failed me for my
cheesecakesand of the havercakes I made two days agone why not a
crumb is left But eat my masters eat and drink Though these be but
country victuals none of your Court kickshaws I warrant you they are
fresh and savoury I would commend you now to this rabbit pie

Peace Betty peace The woman prates o pies like a pie magpie
herself What saith the Apostle I suffer not a woman to speak in
presence of the mans authority Ha done good Betty with thy harping
on kitchen matterslet thy savoury messes be companioned with a sauce
of silence

Temporary eclipse of Mrs Milton obvious and malevolent satisfaction of
Anne and Mary desperately suppressed inclination to giggle on the part
of little Deborah and a desire to cover up the situation with talk as
regards kindly Lawrence and courtly Skinner

The foreign folk were no new thing Miltons fame indeed was European
as a prosewriter and pamphleteer be it understood not as a poet Had
he not refuted and put to shame the most erudite scholars of the day
Foreign savants of note therefore who might be visiting London were
desirous to acquaint themselves with so powerful a personality and the
little house in the Artillery Walk was the rendezvous for many
distinguished persons They found their host no such recluse as towntalk
might have led them to imagine but one ready and willing to converse
with theman English gentleman to the backbone a scholar and artist
to the fingertips His Continental tours and Italian sojourns had made
him less insular than most of his compatriots and his vast range of
reading had imparted a certain cosmopolitanism to his exceedingly
individual lines of thought The visitors found him moreover employed
upon a work so important and of a theme so lofty as might well give
them pause considering the circumstances under which it was being
accomplished and whatever their particular religious tenets might be
they could not fail to admire the magnitude of his aim in composing
Paradise LostTo justify the ways of God to men

Dinner despatched the master of the house led by his devoted friends
went out into the garden A garden was the desideratum of his existence
and he had never been without one for in seventeenthcentury London
every house was fitly furnished in this respect Here Milton was in the
habit of taking that steady exercise which was a sine qu non to a
sedentary and gouty man He made a point of walking up and down out of
doors in cold weather for three or four hours at a timesometimes
composing his majestic lines sometimes merely meditating When weary
with walking he would come in and either dictate what he had conceived
or would take further exercise in a swing In really warm weather he
received his visitors sitting outside his house door wrapped in a
coarse grey overcoatgazing out upon the fields of the Artillery ground
with those unblemished eyes that belied their own clear beautythe
only point as he said in which I am against my will a hypocrite
Today being cool and cloudy allowed but intermittent periods in the
open air Milton Lawrence and Skinner paced slowly to and fro deep in
enthralling intercourse until three oclock when the rain and Thomas
Elwood arrived simultaneously and the other two men departed to their
respective avocations

Thomas Elwood was a young Quaker of twentythree who was acting in some
degree as honorary secretary to Milton Himself of a defective education
and having been expelled from his fathers house on account of his
religious opinions he was only too glad to take a lodging in the
neighbourhood and by reading aloud to Milton every afternoon acquire
an amount of information and a variety of learning which by no other
means could he have obtained And there was also a tacit sympathy
between them insomuch as Milton was more and more as life went on
inclining towards the Quaker tenetsin those days bien entendu
viewed with horror and detestation by the majority of men

Having reentered the house We will not read as yet Tom Milton said
I desire greatly to comfort myself with sweet sounds Bring me into the
withdrawingroom and place me at the organ A little bellowsblowing
will not hurt thee Tom And let my wife attend me that we may have
song withal She hath a good voice though a poor ear

Seated at his beloved instrument the blind man steeped himself in the
principal pleasure that was left him Miltons father stout Puritan
though he might be was an accomplished musician and had taught his
son to play in early youth The austerities of a narrow dogma had not
been able to crush out the inveterate artistry of either father or
son and now the devotee of divinest Melancholy was able to solace
himself with such lovely concords such anthems clear

    As may with sweetness through mine ear
     Dissolve me into ecstasies
     And bring all heaven before mine eyes

Sometimes he sang as he played sometimes Mrs Milton with her clear
unemotional notes sang to his accompaniment Presently that Elwood
should not be wearied in his blowing he quitted the organ for the
bassviol on which he was no mean performer At the conclusion of his
playing he sat with a rapt transfigured face such as might well have
called forth the Italians encomium thirty years beforeIf thy piety
were equal to thy understanding figure eloquence beauty and manners
verily thou wouldest not be an Angle but an Angel

And now good Tom quoth Milton to the young man let us to work the
day moves on apace They went upstairs to the study Before we read I
have some forty lines to set down continued the poet all day they
have been knocking for admission and with that last music they made
entrance Needs must I house them now in ink and paper

I am instant at thy bidding friend and Elwood seated himself with
dutiful alacrity at the table Milton placing himself obliquely athwart
his elbowchair with one leg thrown across the arm dictated forty
lines almost in a breaththey burst from him as it would seem in a
stream no longer to be restrained

Gently gently good sir exclaimed Elwood slowwitted and slow
fingered I may bebut I cannot keep pace with thee

A grim smile hovered over Miltons full lips Out of practice Tom he
replied indulgently it is a long while since I required this service
at thy hands From the autumnal to the vernal equinox as I have told
thee my muse lies dumb
            and silent as the moon
    When she deserts the night
    Hid in her vacant interlunar cave


But now the winter is overpast the singing of birds is heard in our
land and she too awakes and sings With the vernal equinox my thoughts
flow free as Helicon Then with slow and deliberate diction he
repeated the lines once more and having had them read aloud to him he
compressed condensed concentrated every thought and phrase and
reduced them to twenty

There is more to come queried Elwood his quill poised ready to write

No more Not one word more at present replied Milton sighing as
though somewhat exhausted

His inspiration was entirely intermittent and sometimes he would lie
awake all night trying but without success to complete one single
line to his liking They please me not wholly these lines he
continued much remains to be done before I set them down to be changed
no more

Not every man would say so replied Elwood the learning and
erudition whereof these few lines alone give witness would supply many
with just cause for boasting throughout a lifetime

Milton shook his head Pomp and ostentation of reading he remarked
is admired among the vulgar but in matters of religion he is
learnedest who is plainest

        And may at last my weary age

        The hairy gown and mossy cell
        Where I may sit and rightly spell
        Of every star that heaven doth show

                           Il Penseroso


Illustration Il Penseroso colour plate


Yet Mr Milton thee hast the reputation of such scope and range of
wisdom as the greatest scholar in Europe might fitly envy To me I
confess in my poor unlettered ignorance it is not conceivable in what
manner thee acquired so great and witty powers

I gathered them not of mine own strength said Milton but they were
mine for the asking and endeavour and any man may obtain them in like
fashion I ceased not nor will cease in devout prayer to the Holy
Spirit that can enrich with all utterance and knowledge and send out
his Seraphim with the hallowed fire of His altar to touch and purify
the lips of whom He pleases To this must be added select reading and
steady observation and insight into all seemly and generous acts and
affairs And now good Tom to reading

Elwood took up the Latin author which he was at present engaged upon
and proceeded with it Whenever the preternaturally acute ear of Milton
detected by Elwoods intonation that he did not quite understand a
sentence he would stop him examine him and elucidate the difficult
passage By and by You will find a saying very similar to that he
observed in Virgil his Fourth Eclogue Fetch down the book and let us
hear what the Mantuan hath written therein

Elwood searched along the bookshelves but to no avail Friend said
he thy Virgil is no longer here Yesterday I handled it myselftoday
it is vanished So is the Lucretius A frown contracted Miltons
splendid brow These womenkind he muttered like rumbling thunder
they are verily the root of all evil Bid me hither my wife and
daughters and Mary Fisher the maid moreover The first and the last
being summoned arrived in all haste and disavowed any knowledge of the
missing books Anne and Mary Milton it appeared were gone out
marketing but little Deborah being strictly crossexamined confessed
that she had seen sister Anne carrying books away from the study last
night when their father had retired the wherewithal for marketing
was easily obtained in this way

Milton groaned in his ineptitude How have I deserved this treacherous
dealing at their hands Lord how long shall I be

              dark in light exposed
    To daily fraud contempt abuse and wrong
    Within doors and without still as a fool
    In power of others never in my own

                          Samson Agonistes


Here by a happy coincidence there was a sturdy hammering heard at the
front door and Andrew Marvell was ushered in I am out of my due
time said he for it is not yet gone sixsix to eight PM being
Miltons best time for receiving visitors Yet to so old an offender
as myself John I know thou wilt make an exception Marvell was the
one friend of his own type and standing the one constant and
inalienable comrade upon whose fidelity the blind man could rely He had
formerly been Miltons colleague under the Cromwellian Government and
was his kindred spirit so far as anyone could claim such relationship
with the frozen heights of the poets intellect

With him during the next two hoursthe learned physician Paget joining
them and Elwood listening in respectful silence to the converse of these
mighty menMilton forgot the vexations of his illassorted household He
assured his friends that he was truly far happier now in poverty
infirmity and neglect occupied solely upon his longprojected
masterpiece than during the eighteen years of his manly prime when his
mind and pen were solely employed upon the controversies which he now
professed to hate Never again he declared shall earthly ambitions
interrupt and thwart me never now shall I endure to leave a calm and
pleasing solitariness fed with cheerful and confident thoughts to
embark in a tumbled sea of noises and hoarse disputes Cast out of my
fools Paradise of fame not worth the finding shall not I and the hope
whereunto I am wedded explore some fair and fragrant tract of outer
Eden Even as I have set forth the banishment of our first parents

    Some natural tears they dropped but wiped them soon
    The world was all before them where to choose
    Their place of rest and Providence their guide
    They hand in hand with wandering steps and slow
    Through Eden took their solitary way

                                       Paradise Lost


I and my espoused hope indeed do tread through Eden

The four men now at eight oclock went down to supper a very spare and
frugal meal so far as Milton was concerned for all he consumed was a
little light wine a piece of bread and a few olives His flow of speech
was still unwearied his spirits as near vivacity as they could approach
it when his friends rose to take leave The night is yet young said
Paget but I know that nowadays you seek rest early That is so
Milton assented since I am no longer able to study o nights and
since the best of secretarieshe smiled towards Elwoodmust needs
grow weary of a blind mans whims I were as well in bed as out of it
Moreover I can compose my lines to better advantage lying down

One thing at least you are spared Marvell told him darkness
cannot discommode your doings nor doth the eyeweariness of the
midnight student afflict you with grievous browaches in the morning as
of old

Milton answered My darkness hitherto by the singular kindness of God
amid rest and studies and the voices and greetings of friends has been
much easier to bear than that deathly one What should prevent me from
resting in the belief that eyesight lies not in eyes alone but enough
for all purposes in Gods leading and providence And to you now I bid
farewell with a mind not less brave and steadfast than if I were
Lynceus himself for keenness of sight

In a short space of time he was at rest in his darkened room not as yet
drowsy but revolving great phrases and deriving a greater joy from
these lonely silences of the nightwatches than could ever accrue to him
by day Gradually the aisles and bowers of the Paradise which his mental
eyes enjoyed took upon them more and more the lovely similitude of rural
England The greennesses and sweetnesses of his childhoods home the
Buckinghamshire village were fused into the eternal spring of the
primeval garden And from the glassy cool translucent wave of the
river that ran through Eden
