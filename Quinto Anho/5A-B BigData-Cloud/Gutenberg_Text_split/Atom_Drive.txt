ATOM DRIVE

BY CHARLES FONTENAY

     It was a race between the tortoise and the hare But this hare was
     using some dirty tricks to make sure the ending would be
     different

Illustration Illustrated by Ed Emsh


The two spaceship crews were friendly enemies sitting across the table
from each other for their last meal before blastoff Outside the ports
the sky was nothing but lightstreaked blackness punctured periodically
by Earth glare for Space Station  whirled swiftly on its axis
creating an artificial gravity

Jonner I figured you the last man ever to desert the rockets for a
hotrod towjob chided Russo Baat captain of the Mars Corporations
gleaming new freighter Marsward XVIII Baat was fat and redfaced
and one of the shrewdest space captains in the business

Jonner Jons at the other end of the table inclined his grizzled head
and smiled

Times change Russo he answered quietly Even the Mars Corporation
cant stop that

Is it true that youre pulling five thousand tons of cargo Captain
asked one of the crewmen of the Marsward XVIII

Something like that agreed Jonner and his smile broadened And I
have only about twice the fuel supply you carry for a ton payload

The communicator above them squawked and blared

Captain Jons and Captain Baat of Martian competition run please report
to control for final briefing

I knew it grumbled Baat getting heavily and reluctantly to his feet
I havent gotten to finish a meal on this blasted merrygoround yet

In the space stations control section Commander Ortega of the Space
Control Commission an ascetic officer in plain blues looked them up
and down severely

As you know gentlemen he said blastoff time is  Tonnage of
cargo fuel and empty vessels cannot be a factor under the law The
Mars Corporation will retain its exclusive franchise to the EarthMars
run unless the ship sponsored by the AtomStar Company returns to Earth
with full cargo at least twenty hours ahead of the ship sponsored by the
Mars Corporation Cargo must be unloaded at Mars and new cargo taken on
I do not consider the twentyhour bias in favor of the Mars Corporation
a fair one said Ortega severely turning his gaze to Baat but the
Space Control Commission does not make the laws It enforces them
Docking and loading facilities will be available to both of you on an
equal basis at Phobos and Marsport Good luck

He shook hands with both of them

Saturn Im glad to get out of there exclaimed Baat mopping his brow
as they left the control section Every time I take a step I feel like
Im falling on my face

Its because the control sections so close to the center replied
Jonner The stations spinning to maintain artificial gravity and your
feet are away from the center As long as youre standing upright the
pull is straight up and down to you but actually your feet are moving
faster than your head in a larger orbit When you try to move as in
normal gravity your body swings out of that line of pull and you nearly
fall The best corrective Ive found is to lean backward slightly when
you start to walk

As the two space captains walked back toward the wardroom together Baat
said

Jonner I hear the Mars Corporation offered you the Marsward XVIII
for this run first and you turned them down Why You piloted the
Marsward V and the Wayward Lady for Marscorp when those upstarts in
the Argentine were trying to crack the EarthMars run This AtomStar
couldnt have enough money to buy you away from Marscorp

No Marscorp offered me more said Jonner soberly now But this
atomic drive is the future of space travel Russo Marscorp has it but
theyre sitting on it because theyve got their fingers in hydrazine
interests here and the atom drive will make hydrazine useless for space
fuel Unless I can break the franchise for AtomStar it may be a
hundred years before we switch to the atom drive in space

What the hell difference does that make to you asked Baat bluntly

Hydrazines expensive replied Jonner Reaction mass isnt and you
use less of it I was born on Mars Russo Mars is my home and I want
to see my people get the supplies they need from Earth at a reasonable
transport cost not pay through the nose for every packet of vegetable
seed

They reached the wardroom door

Too bad I have to degrav my old chief said Baat chuckling But Im
a rocket man myself and I say to hell with your hotrod atom drive
Im sorry you got deflected into this run Jonner youll never break
Marscorps orbit

                                   

The Marsward XVIII was a huge vessel the biggest the Mars Corporation
ever had put into space It was a collection of spheres and cylinders
joined together by a network of steel ties Nearly  of its weight was
fuel for the oneway trip to Mars

Its competitor the Radiant Hope riding ten miles away in orbit
around the Earth was the strangest looking vessel ever to get clearance
from a space station It looked like a tug towing a barge The tug was
the atomic power plant Two miles behind attached by a thin cable was
the passenger compartment and cargo

On the control deck of the Radiant Hope Jonner gripped a microphone
and shouted profane instructions at the pilot of a squat groundtospace
rocket twenty miles away Tan Li Cho the ships engineer was peering
out the port at the speck of light toward which Jonner was directing his
wrath while Qoqol the Martian astrogator worked at his charts on the
other side of the deck

I thought all cargo was aboard Jonner said Tan

It is said Jonner laying the mike aside That Gboat isnt hauling
cargo Its going with us Im not taking any chances on Marscorp
refusing to ferry our cargo back and forth at Mars

Is plotted Jonner boomed Qoqol turning his head to peer at them
with huge eyes through the spidery tangle of his thin doublejointed
arms and legs He reached an eightfoot arm across the deck and handed
Jonner his figures Jonner gave them to Tan

Figure out power for that one Tan ordered Jonner and took his seat
in the cushioned control chair

Tan pulled a slide rule from his tunic pocket but his black almond
eyes rested quizzically on Jonner

Its four hours before blastoff he reminded

Ive cleared power for this with Space Control replied Jonner That
planetloving Gboat jockey missed orbit Well have to swing out a
little and go to him

On a conventional space craft the order for acceleration would have
sent the engineer to the engine deck to watch his gauges and report by
intercom But the Radiant Hopes engine deck was the atomic tug two
miles ahead which Tan in heavy armor would enter only in
emergencies He calculated for a moment then called softly to Jonner

Pile One in ten

In ten confirmed Jonner pulling a lever on the calibrated gauge of
the radio control

Pile Two in fifteen

In fifteen

Check Ill have the length of burst figured for you in a jiffy

A faint glow appeared around the atomic tug far ahead and there was the
faintest shiver in the ship But after a moment Qoqol said in a puzzled
tone

No Gs Jonner Engine not work

Sure shes working said Jonner with a grin Youll never get any
more G than weve got now Qoqol all the way to Mars Our maximum
acceleration will be thG

One threethousandth exclaimed Tan shaken out of his Oriental calm
Jonner the Marsward will blast away at one or two Gs How do you
expect to beat that at th

Because they have to cut off and coast most of the way in an elliptic
orbit like any other rocket answered Jonner calmly We drive
straight across the system under power all the time We accelerate half
way decelerate the other half

But th

Youll be surprised at what constant power can do I know Baat and I
know the trick hes going to use Its obvious from the blastoff time
they arranged Hes going to tack off the Moon and use his power right
to cut  days off that regular day schedule But this tugboat will
make it in  days

They took aboard the ton landing boat By the time they got it
secured the radio already was sounding warnings for blastoff

Zero hour arrived Again Jonner pulled levers and again the faint glow
appeared around the tail of their distant tug Across space the exhaust
of the Marsward XVIII flared into blinding flame In a moment it
began to pull ahead visibly and soon was receding like a meteor

Near the Radiant Hope the space station seemed not to have changed
position at all

The race is not always to the swift remarked Jonner philosophically

And were the tortoise said Tan How about filling us in on this
jaunt Jonner

Is should Jonner agreed Qoqol Tan know all about crazy new
engine I know all about crazy new orbit Both not know all You tell

I planned to anyway said Jonner I had figured on having Serj in on
it but he wouldnt understand much of it anyhow Theres no use in
waking him up

Serj was the ships doctorpsychologist and fourth member of the crew
He was asleep below on the centerdeck

For your information Qoqol said Jonner the atomic engine produces
electrical energy which accelerates reaction mass Actually its a
crude ion engine Tan can explain the details to you later but the
important thing is that the fuel is cheap the fueltocargo ratio is
low and constant acceleration is practical

As for you Tan I was surprised at your not understanding why well
use low acceleration To boost the engine power and give us more Gs
wed either have to carry more fuel or coast part of the way on
momentum like an ordinary rocket This ways more efficient and our
day margin over the Marsward each way is more than enough for
unloading and loading more cargo and fuel

With those figures I cant see how Marscorp expects to win this
competition said Tan

Weve got them flat on the basis of performance agreed Jonner So
well have to watch for tricks I know Marscorp Thats why I arranged
to take aboard that Gboat at the last minute Marscorp controls all the
Gboats at Marsport and theyre smart enough to keep us from using
them in spite of the Space Control Commission As for refueling for the
return trip we can knock a chunk off of Phobos for reaction mass

The meteor alarm bells clanged suddenly and the screen lit up once with
a fastmoving red line that traced the path of the approaching object

Miss us about half a mile said Jonner after a glance at the screen
Must be pretty big  and its coming up

He and Tan floated to one of the ports and in a few moments saw the
object speed by

Thats no meteor exclaimed Jonner with a puzzled frown Thats
manmade But its too small for a Gboat

The radio blared All craft in orbit near Space Station  Warning All
craft near Space Station  Experimental missile misfired from White
Sands Repeat experimental missile misfired from White Sands
Coordinates

Fine time to tell us remarked Tan drily

Experimental missile hell snorted Jonner comprehension dawning
Qoqol what would have happened if we hadnt shifted orbit to take
aboard that Gboat

Qoqol calculated a moment

Hit our engines he announced Dead center

Jonners blue eyes clouded ominously Looks like theyre playing for
keeps this time boys

                                   

The brotherhood of spacemen is an exclusive club Any captain
astrogator or engineer is likely to be well known to his colleagues
either personally or by reputation

The ships doctorpsychologist is in a different category Most of them
sign on for a few runs for the adventure of it as a means of getting
back and forth between planets without paying the high cost of passage
or to pick up even more money than they can get from lucrative
planetbound practice

Jonner did not know Serj the Radiant Hopes doctor Neither Tan nor
Qoqol ever had heard of him But Serj appeared to know his business well
enough and was friendly enough

It was Serjs first trip and he was very interested in the way the ship
operated He nosed into every corner of it and asked a hundred questions
a day

Youre as inquisitive as a cadet spaceman Serj Jonner told him on
the twentyfifth day out Everybody knew everyone else well by then
which meant that Jonner and Qoqol who had served together before had
become acquainted with Tan and Serj

Theres a lot to see and learn about space Captain said Serj He was
a young fellow with fair hair and an easy grin Think I could go
outside

If you keep a lifeline hooked on The suits have magnetic shoes to hold
you to the hull of the ship but you can lose your footing

Thanks said Serj He touched his hand to his forehead and left the
control deck

Jonner near the end of his eighthour duty shift watched the dials

The red light showing the inner airlock door was open blinked on It
blinked off then the outer airlock indicator went on and off

A shadow fell across Jonner briefly He glanced at the port and reached
for the microphone

Careful and dont step on any of the ports he warned Serj The
magnetic soles wont hold on them

Ill be careful sir answered Serj

No one but a veteran spaceman would have noticed the faint quiver that
ran through the ship but Jonner felt it Automatically he swung his
control chair and his eyes swept the bank of dials

At first he saw nothing The outer lock light blinked on and off then
the inner lock indicator That was Serj coming back inside

Then Jonner noted that the hand on one dial rested on zero Above the
dial was the word ACCELERATION

His eyes snapped to the radio controls The atomic pile levers were
still at their proper calibration The dials above them said the engines
were working properly

The atomic tug was still accelerating but passengers and cargo were in
free fall

Swearing Jonner jerked at the levers to pull out the piles aboard the
tug

A blue flash flared across the control board momentarily blinding him
Jonner recoiled only his webbed safety belt preventing him from
plummeting from the control chair

He swung back anxiously to the dials brushing futilely at the spots
that swam before his eyes He breathed a sigh of relief The radio
controls had operated The atomic engines had ceased firing

Tentatively cautiously he reversed the lever There was no blue flash
this time but neither did the dials quiver He swore Something had
burned out in the radio controls He couldnt reverse the tug

He punched the general alarm button viciously and the raucous clangor
of the bell sounded through the confines of the ship One by one the
other crew members popped up to the control deck from below

He turned the controls over to Qoqol

Take readings on that damn tug Jonner ordered I think our cable
broke Tan lets go take a look

When they got outside they found about a foot of the oneinch cable
still attached to the ship The rest of it drawn away by the tug before
Jonner could cut acceleration was out of sight

Can it be welded Tan

It can but itll take a while replied the engineer slowly First
well have to reverse that tug and get the other end of that break

Damn and the radio controls burned out I tried to reverse it before
I sounded the alarm Tan how fast can you get those controls
repaired

Great space exclaimed Tan softly Without seeing it Id say at
least two days Jonner Those controls are complicated as hell

They reentered the ship Qoqol was working at his diagrams and Serj
was looking over his shoulder Jonner took a heatgun quietly from the
rack and pointed it at Serj

Youll get below mister he commanded grimly Youll be handcuffed
to your bunk from here on out

Sir I dont understand stammered Serj

Like hell you dont You cut that cable Jonner accused

Serj started to shrug but he dropped his eyes

They paid me he said in a low tone They paid me a thousand solars

What good would a thousand solars do you when youre dead Serj 
dead of suffocation and drifting forever in space

Serj looked up in astonishment

Why you can still reach Earth by radio easy he said It wouldnt
take long for a rescue ship to reach us

Chemical rockets have their limitations said Jonner coldly

And you dont realize what speed weve built up with steady
acceleration Wed head straight out of the system and nothing could
intercept us if that tug had gotten too far before we noticed it was
gone

He jabbed the whitefaced doctor with the muzzle of the heatgun

Get below he ordered Ill turn you over to Space Control at Mars

When Serj had left the control deck Jonner turned to the others His
face was grave

That tug picked up speed before I could shut off the engines after the
cable was cut he said Its moving away from us slowly and at a
tangent And solar gravitys acting on both bodies now By the time we
get those controls repaired the drift may be such that well waste
weeks maneuvering the tug back

I could jet out to the tug in a spacesuit before it gets too far
away said Tan thoughtfully But that wouldnt do any good Theres
no way of controlling the engines at the tug It has to be done by
radio

If we get out of this remind me to recommend that atomic ships always
carry a spare cable said Jonner gloomily If we had one we could
splice them and hold the ship to the tug until the controls are
repaired

Is cable in cargo strong enough Jonner asked Qoqol

Thats right exclaimed Jonner brightening Most of our cargos
cable That ton spool were hauling back there is  miles of
cable to lay a television network between the Martian cities

Television cable repeated Tan doubtfully Will that be strong
enough

Its bound in flonite that new fluorine compound Its strong enough
to tow this whole cargo at a couple of Gs Theres nothing aboard this
ship that would cut off a length of ita heatgun at full power
wouldnt even scorch itbut we can unwind enough of it and block the
spool Itll hold the ship to the tug until the controls can be
repaired then we can reverse the tug and weld the cable

You mean the whole  miles of its in one piece demanded Tan in
astonishment

Thats not so much The cablelaying steamer Dominia carried 
miles in one piece to lay Atlantic cables in the early th century

But howll we ever get  tons in one piece down to Mars asked
Tan No Gboat can carry that load

Jonner chuckled

Same way they got it up from Earth to the ship he answered They
attached one end of it to a Gboat and sent it up to orbit then wound
it up on a fast winch Since the Gboat will be decelerating to Mars
the unwinding will have to be slowed or the cable would tangle itself
all over Syrtis

Sounds like its made to order said Tan grinning Ill get into my
spacesuit

Youll get to work on the radio controls contradicted Jonner getting
up Thats something I cant do and I can get into a spacesuit and
haul a length of cable out to the tug Qoqol can handle the winch

                                   

Deveet the AtomStar Companys representative at Mars City and Kruger
of the Space Control Commission were waiting when the Radiant Hopes
Gboat dropped down from the Phobos station and came to rest in a wash
of jets They rode out to the Gboat together in a Commission groundcar
Jonner emerged from the Gboat following the handcuffed Serj

Hes all yours Jonner told Kruger gesturing at Serj You have my
radio reports on the cablecutting and Ill make my log available to
you

Kruger put his prisoner in the front seat of the groundcar beside him
and Jonner climbed in the back seat with Deveet

I brought the crates of dies for the groundcar factory down this time
Jonner told Deveet Well bring down all the loose cargo before
shooting the television cable down While theyre unloading the Gboat
I wish youd get the tanks refilled with hydrazine and nitric acid
Ive got enough to get back up but not enough for a round trip

What do you plan to do asked Deveet He was a darkskinned
longfaced man with a sardonic twist to his mouth

Ive got to sign on a new ships doctor to replace Serj When the
Marsward comes in Marscorp will have a dozen Gboats working round
the clock to unload and reload her With only one Gboat weve got to
make every hour count We still have reaction mass to pick up on
Phobos

Right agreed Deveet You can take the return cargo up in one load
though Its just twenty tons of Martian relics for the Solar Museum
MarstoEarth cargos run light

At the administration building Jonner took his leave of Deveet and went
up to the Space Control Commissions personnel office on the second
floor He was in luck On the board as applying for a MarsEarth run as
ships doctorpsychologist was one name Lana Elden

He looked up the name in the Mars City directory and dialed into the
city from a nearby telephone booth A womans voice answered

Is Lana Elden there asked Jonner

Im Lana Elden she said

Jonner swore under his breath A woman But if she werent qualified
her name would not have been on the Commission board

The verbal contract was made quickly and Jonner cut the Commission
monitor into the line to make it binding That was done often when rival
ships even of the same line were bidding for the services of crewmen

Blastoff time is  tonight he said ending the interview Be
here

Jonner left the personnel office and walked down the hall At the
elevator Deveet and Kruger hurried out almost colliding with him

Jonner weve run into trouble exclaimed Deveet Space Fuels wont
sell us any hydrazine and nitric acid to refill the tanks They say they
have a new contract with Marscorp that takes all their supply

Contract hell snorted Jonner Marscorp owns Space Fuels What can
be done about it Kruger

Kruger shook his head

Im all for you but Space Control has no jurisdiction he said If a
private firm wants to restrict its sales to a franchised line theres
nothing we can do about it If you had a franchise we could force them
to allot fuel on the basis of cargo handled since Space Fuels has a
monopoly here But you dont have a franchise yet

Jonner scratched his grey head thoughtfully

It was a serious situation The atompowered Radiant Hope could no
more make a planetary landing than the chemicallypowered ships Its
power gave a low sustained thrust that permitted it to accelerate
constantly over long periods of time To beat the powerful pull of
planetary surface gravity the terrific burst of quick energy from the
streamlined Gboats the planetary landing craft was needed

We can still handle it Jonner said at last With only twenty tons
return cargo we can take it up this trip Add some large parachutes to
that Deveet Well shoot the end of the cable down by signal rocket
out in the lowlands and stop the winch when weve made contact long
enough to attach the rest of the cargo to the cable Pull it down with
the cable and with Mars low gravity the parachutes will keep it from
being damaged

But when Jonner got back to the landing field to check on unloading
operations his plan was smashed As he approached the Gboat a
mechanic wearing an illconcealed smirk came up to him

Captain looks like you sprung a leak in your fuel line he said All
your hydrazines leaked out in the sand

Jonner swung from the waist and knocked the man flat Then he turned on
his heel and went back to the administration building to pay the
credit fine he would be assessed for assaulting a spaceport employee

                                   

The Space Control Commissions hearing room in Mars City was almost
empty The examiner sat on the bench resting his chin on his hand as he
listened to testimony In the plaintiffs section sat Jonner flanked by
Deveet and Lana Elden In the defense box were the Mars Corporation
attorney and Captain Russo Baat of the Marsward XVIII Kruger seated
near the rear of the room was the only spectator

The Mars Corporation attorney had succeeded in delaying the final
hearing more than a day Martian month by legal maneuvers Meanwhile
the Marsward XVIII had blasted down to Phobos and Gboats had been
shuttling back and forth unloading the vessel and reloading it for the
return trip to Earth

When testimony had been completed the examiner shuffled through his
papers He put on his spectacles and peered over them at the litigants

It is the ruling of this court he said formally that the plaintiffs
have not presented sufficient evidence to prove tampering with the fuel
line of the Gboat of the spaceship Radiant Hope There is no evidence
that it was cut or burned but only that it was broken The court must
remind the plaintiffs that this could have been done accidentally
through inept handling of cargo

Since the plaintiffs have not been able to prove their contention this
court of complaint has no alternative than to dismiss the case

The examiner arose and left the hearing room Baat waddled across the
aisle puffing

Too bad Jonner he said I dont like the stuff Marscorps pulling
and I think you know I dont have anything to do with it

I want to win but I want to win fair and square If theres anything I
can do to help

Havent got a spare Gboat in your pocket have you retorted Jonner
with a rueful smile

Baat pulled at his jowls

The Marsward isnt carrying Gboats he said regretfully They all
belong to the port and Marscorps got them so tied up youll never get
a sniff of one But if you want to get back to your ship Jonner I can
take you up to Phobos with me as my guest

Jonner shook his head

I figure on taking the Radiant Hope back to Earth he said But Im
not blasting off without cargo until its too late for me to beat you on
the run

You sure Thisll be my last ferry trip The Marsward blasts off for
Earth at  tomorrow

No thanks Russo But I will appreciate your taking my ships doctor
Dr Elden up to Phobos

Done agreed Baat Lets go Dr Elden The Gboat leaves Marsport in
two hours

Jonner watched Baat puff away with the slender whiteclad brunette at
his side Baat personally would see Lana Elden safely aboard the
Radiant Hope even if it delayed his own blastoff

Morosely he left the hearing room with Deveet

What I cant understand said the latter is why all this dirty work
why didnt Marscorp just use one of their atomdrive ships for the
competition run

Because whatever ship is used on a competition run has to be kept in
service on the franchised run answered Jonner Marscorp has millions
tied up in hydrazine interests and theyre more interested in keeping
an atomic ship off this run than they are in a monopoly franchise But
they tie in together if Marscorp loses the monopoly franchise and
AtomStar puts in atomdrive ships Marscorp will have to switch to
atomdrive to meet the competition

If we had a franchise we could force Space Fuels to sell us
hydrazine said Deveet unhappily

Well we dont And at this rate well never get one

                                   

Jonner and Deveet were fishing at the Mars City Recreation Center It
had been several weeks since the Marsward XVIII blasted off to Earth
with a full cargo And still the atomic ship Radiant Hope rested on
Phobos with most of her Marsbound cargo still aboard and still her crew
languished at the Phobos space station and still Jonner moved back and
forth between Mars City and Marsport daily racking his brain for a
solution that would not come

How in space do you get twenty tons of cargo up to an orbit  miles
out without any rocket fuel he demanded of Deveet more than once He
received no satisfactory answer

The Recreation Center was a twoacre park that lay beneath the plastic
dome of Mars City Above them they could see swiftmoving Phobos and
distant Deimos among the other stars that powdered the night In the
park around them colonists rode the amusement machines canoed along
the canal that twisted through the park or sipped refreshment at
scattered tables A dozen or more sat like Jonner and Deveet around
the edge of the tiny lake fishing

Deveets line tightened He pulled in a streamlined flapping object
from which the light glistened wetly

Good catch complimented Jonner Thats worth a full credit

Deveet unhooked his catch and laid it on the bank beside him It was a
metal fish live fish were unknown on Mars They paid for the privilege
of fishing for a certain time and any fish caught were sold back to
the management at a fixed price depending on size to be put back into
the lake

Youre pretty good at it said Jonner Thats your third tonight

Its all in the speed at which you reel in your line explained
Deveet The fish move at preset speeds Theyre made to turn and catch
a hook that moves across their path at a slightly slower speed than
theyre swimming The management changes the speeds once a week to keep
the fishermen from getting too expert

You cant beat the management chuckled Jonner But if its a matter
of matching orbital speeds to make contact I ought to do pretty well
when I get the hang of it

He cocked an eye up toward the transparent dome Phobos had moved across
the sky into Capricorn since he last saw her His memory automatically
ticked off the satellites orbital speed  miles a second speed in
relation to planetary motion

Why go over that again One had to have fuel first Meanwhile the
Radiant Hope lay idle on Phobos and its crew whiled away the hours at
the space station inside the moon their feet spinning faster than their
heads  no that wasnt true on Phobos because it didnt have a spin
to impart artificial gravity like the space stations around Earth

He sat up suddenly Deveet looked at him in surprise Jonners lips
moved silently for a moment then he got to his feet

Where can we use a radiophone he asked

One in my office said Deveet standing up

Lets go Quick before Phobos sets

They turned in their rods Deveet collecting the credits for his fish
and left the Recreation Center

When they reached the AtomStar Companys Martian office Jonner plugged
in the radiophone and called the Phobos space station He got Tan

All of you get aboard Jonner ordered Then have Qoqol call me

He signed off and turned to Deveet Can we charter a plane to haul our
Earthbound cargo out of Marsport

A plane I suppose so Where do you want to haul it

Charax is as good as any other place But I need a fast plane

I think we can get it Marscorp still controls all the airlines but
the Mars government keeps a pretty strict finger on their planetbound
operations They cant refuse a cargo haul without good reason

Just to play safe have some friend of yours whom they dont know
charter the plane in his name They wont know its us till we start
loading cargo

Right said Deveet picking up the telephone I know just the man

                                   

Towmotors scuttled across the landing area at Marsport shifting the
cargo that had been destined for the Radiant Hope from the helpless
Gboat to a jet cargoplane Nearby watching the operation were Jonner
and Deveet with the Marsport agent of Mars Air Transport Company

We didnt know AtomStar was the one chartering the plane until you
ordered the Gboat cargo loaded on it confessed the MarsAir agent

I see you and Mr Deveet are signed up to accompany the cargo Youll
have to rent suits for the trip We have to play it safe and theres
always the possibility of a forced landing

There are a couple of spacesuits aboard the Gboat that we want to take
along said Jonner casually Well just wear those instead

Okay The agent spread his hands and shrugged Everybody at Marsport
knows about you bucking Marscorp Captain What you expect to gain by
transferring your cargo to Charax is beyond me but its your business

An hour later the chartered airplane took off with a thunder of jets
Aboard was the ton cargo the Radiant Hope was supposed to carry to
Earth plus some large parachutes The MarsAir pilot wore a light suit
with plastic helmet designed for survival in the thin cold Martian air
Jonner and Deveet wore the bulkier spacesuits

Five minutes out of Marsport Jonner thrust the muzzle of a heatgun in
the pilots back

Set it on automatic strap on your parachute and bail out he ordered
Were taking over

The pilot had no choice He went through the planes airlock and jumped
helped by a hearty boost from Jonner His parachute blossomed out as he
drifted down toward the green Syrtis Major Lowland Jonner didnt worry
about him He knew the pilots helmet radio would reach Marsport and a
helicopter would rescue him shortly

I dont know what youre trying to do Jonner said Deveet
apprehensively over his spacehelmet radio But whatever it is youd
better do it fast Theyll have every plane on Mars looking for us in
half an hour

Let em look and keep quiet a while retorted Jonner Ive got some
figuring to do

He put the plane on automatic took off the spacesuit handhooks and
scribbled figures on a scrap of paper He tuned in the planes radio and
called Qoqol on Phobos They talked to each other briefly in Martian

The darker green line of a canal crossed the green lowland below them

Good theres Drosinas muttered Jonner Lets see time  hours
speed  miles an hour

Jonner boosted the jets a bit and watched the terrain

By Saturn I almost overran it he exclaimed Deveet smash out those
ports

Break out the ports repeated Deveet Thatll depressurize the
cabin

Thats right So youd better be sure your spacesuits secure

Obviously puzzled Deveet strode up and down the cabin knocking out its
six windows with the handhooks of his spacesuit Jonner maneuvered the
plane gently and set it on automatic He got out of the pilots seat
and strode to the right front port

Reaching through the broken window he pulled in a section of cable that
was trailing alongside While the baffled Deveet watched he reeled it
in until he brought up the end of it to which was attached a
fishshaped finned metal missile

Jonner carried the cable end and the attached missile across the cabin
and tossed it out the broken front port on the other side swinging it
so that the mileanhour slipstream snapped it back in through the
rearmost port like a bullet

Pick it up and pass it out the right rear port he commanded Well
have to pass it to each other from port to port The slipstream wont
let us swing it forward and through

In a few moments the two of them had worked the missile and the cable
end to the right front port and in through it Originating above the
plane it now made a loop through the four open ports Jonner untied the
missile and tied the end to the portion which came into the cabin
making a bowline knot of the loop Deveet picked up the missile from the
floor where Jonner had thrown it

Looks like a spent rocket shell he commented

Its a signal rocket said Jonner The flare trigger was
disconnected

He picked up the microphone and called the Radiant Hope on Phobos

Weve hooked our fish Qoqol he told the Martian and laid the mike
aside

What does that mean asked Deveet

Means wed better strap in said Jonner suiting the action to the
words Youre in for a short trip to Phobos Deveet

Jonner pulled back slowly on the elevator control and the plane began a
shallow climb At  miles an hour it began to attain a height at
which its broad wingsbroader than those of any terrestrial
planewould not support it

Im trying to decide said Deveet with forced calm whether youve
flipped your helmet

Nope answered Jonner Trolling for those fish in Mars City gave me
the idea The rest was no more than an astrogation problem like any
rendezvous with a ship in a fixed orbit which Qoqol could figure
Remember that mile television cable the ships hauling Qoqol just
shot the end of it down to Mars surface by signal rocket we hooked on
and now hell haul us up to Phobos Hes got the ships engine hooked
onto the cable winch

The jets coughed and stopped The plane was out of fuel It was on
momentumto be drawn by the cable or to snap it and fall

Impossible cried Deveet in alarm Phobos orbital speed is more than
a mile a second No cable can take the sudden difference in that and the
speed were traveling When the slack is gone itll break

The slacks gone already Youre thinking of the speed of Phobos at
Phobos At this end of the cable were like the head of a man in the
control section of a space station which is traveling slower than his
feet because its orbit is smallerbut it revolves around the center in
the same time

Look Jonner added Ill put it in round numbers Figure your cable
as part of a radius of Phobos orbit Phobos travels at  but the
other end of the radius travels at zero because its at the center The
cable end at the Martian surface travels at a speed in
betweenroughly  miles an hourbut it keeps up with Phobos
revolution Since the surface of Mars itself rotates at  miles an
hour all I had to do was boost the plane up to  to match the speed
of the cable end

That cable will haul a hell of a lot more than twenty tons and thats
all thats on it right now By winching us up slowly therell never be
too great a strain on it

Deveet looked apprehensively out of the port The plane was hanging
sidewise now and the distant Martian surface was straight out the
lefthand ports The cable was holding

We can make the trip to Earth  days faster than the Marsward said
Jonner and they have only about  days start It wont take us but a
few days to make Phobos and get this cable and the rest of the cargo
shot back to Mars AtomStar will get its franchise and youll see all
spaceships switching to the atomic drive within the next decade

How about this plane asked Deveet We stole it you know

You can hire a Gboat to take it back to Marsport said Jonner with a
chuckle Pay MarsAir for the time and the broken ports and settle out
of court with that pilot we dropped I dont think theyll send you to
jail Deveet

He was silent for a few minutes

By the way Deveet said Jonner then radio AtomStar to buy some
flonite cable of their own and ship it to Phobos Damned if I dont
think this is cheaper than Gboats
