Sidenote When does life begin A wellknown book says forty A
wellknown radio program says eighty Some folks say its mental
others say its physical But take the strange case of Mel Carlson who
gave a lot of thought to the matter


Mel felt as if he were floating on clouds in the deepest most intense
dark he had ever experienced He tried opening his eyes but nothing
happened only a sharp pain Little bits of memory flashed back and he
tried to figure out what could have happened where he was

The last thing he could remember was the little lab hidden back in the
mountains in an old mine tunnel Remote but only an hours drive from
the city What had he been doing Oh yes arguing with Neil again He
even recalled the exact words

Damn it Mel his partner had said Weve gone about as far as
possible working with animal brains Weve got to get a human one

We cant Mel had disagreed Thered be enough of an uproar if the
papers got hold of what weve been doing with animals If we did get
someone in a hospital to agree to let us use his brain on death they
would close us up tighter than a drum

But our labs too well hidden theyd never know

It wouldnt work anyway The brain might be damaged for lack of oxygen
and all of our work would go for nothing Worse it might indicate
failure where a fresh healthy brain would mean success

Well never know unless we try said Neil almost violently dark eyes
glittering Our funds arent going to last forever

Mel had turned his back and was leaning over the tank where the latest
brainthat from a dogwas lying immersed in the lifegiving liquid a
thin flickering line of light on the oscilloscope behind the tank the
only indication that the brain was alive

What had happened then He thought hard until a sharp pain and growing
headache almost made him lose consciousness Either hed passed out or
something had happened Maybe the cave had collapsed the concrete walls
of their lab although he didnt see how that could have happened

He became aware of voices faint at first then growing stronger He
strained to listen and just when it appeared that the words would become
distinct enough to understand they faded away He waited hopefully
until they came back This time he could understand words and parts of
sentences

 connect this first and

No be careful Too much voltage would ruin everything and wed have
to

Where does this connection go here

The other voice boomed in then deep vibrations feeling as if they would
shatter his brain There was a frantic quality in the words

No no you fool dont A penetrating pain knifed through Mels
head and he tried to scream but heard nothing but a loud buzzing He
welcomed the loss of consciousness as it blanketed him

He struggled back to consciousness once more a voice calling over and
over in a monotone Mel Mel Carlson Can you hear me Mel Mel Mel
Carlson Can you hear me Mel he listened intently recognizing it as
one of the first voices he had heard He tried to move but could feel no
response of legs or arms It was like being buried alive and he tried to
call out for help He must have lost his voice because he could still
hear the same call

Mel Mel Carlson can you It broke off abruptly then came back
triumphantly You do hear me Mel I can see

Again Mel tried to call out without success The other warned quickly
Dont become alarmed Were still working on your voice Just try to
rest Mel suddenly realized that hed been listening to Neil and a wave
of thankfulness swept over him There had been a cavein then and hed
been injured Neil was speaking again a note of professional regret in
his voice

Im sorry it had to happen this way but there was too much tied up in
the project to lose now A growing realization and horror began to seep
through Mels mind Neil continued after a brief pause The sine wave
jumped I see you must realize now I had to do it Mel After all you
arent dead you know just your body is gone Your brain may live for
hundreds of years Why just think youll be able Oblivion again
claimed Mel

                                   

Once more Mel was floating on clouds and this time the sensation was
exhilarating He tried moving his arms and legs to see if he could swim
through the velvety darkness but failed A faint glow began to appear
ahead of him and a low rumble of voices began to echo throughout his
mind Full realization of what had happened swept over him and he
struggled to retain his sanity The voices were louder and he recognized
that of Neil who was saying

 is conscious now Easy on the voltage remember last time A brief
pause then louder Mel I see that you hear me Listen carefully Ive
tried out several of my own theories thats why you can hear And in
just a moment Im going to give you eyesight Were having trouble with
a voice The light began growing in intensity and hurt his eyeballs
Mel remembered then depressed that he had no eyes of his own Even at
the thought he tried to shut his eyes which only caused his brain to
ache more He tried completely relaxing in an endeavor to capture the
floating sensation once more

Ah thats better approved Neils voice I see that the brain wave
has smoothed down If youll just accept whats happened Mel we should
be able to work together Figures began to form in the white mist As
they became stronger but out of focus he saw Neil bent over a control
panel carefully making adjustments and glancing frequently at the
leaping line of green light across the scope in front of him He felt a
surge of hate sweep through his brain and saw the green line jump
violently Neils hand jumped instinctively toward a redcovered switch
At the same time he flashed a glance towards a tank that was barely
within the range of Mels vision He realized almost at once that it
must be the same one in which his brain was resting The full sickening
realization of what had happened hit him and he almost went over the
blackout line Then Neils face loomed square in his direction and
hate the most intense he had ever experienced brought the green line
that represented his brains output up to full level

His brain sent impulses out to the nerve ends that had controlled his
arms and legs They felt as if they were still attached to him but
paralyzed His mind felt clearer and sharper now than it ever had before
in his life He determined to analyze his new mental capabilities
carefully in the hope he would find a means of striking back

During the next few weeks only his hatred for Neil enabled Mel to keep
his sanity The first empty feeling that the future could hold nothing
for him but horror gave way to planning and scheming His mechanical
voice was perfected operated by the nerve ends of his brain much as
his original vocal cords had functioned It enabled him to now assist in
his own rehabilitation by suggesting improvements or solutions to
mechanical aids he could control The steady growth or realization of
his mental powers were amazing to Mel He realized that they must have
been inherent and in his subconscious all of the time only his loss of
body brought them out now That plus the fact that he required
practically no rest if the stimulants pumped into the tank were
sufficient

                                   

This last was the clue to his use by Neil It became apparent that his
erstwhile partner planned on using him to the fullest possible extent
First Neil brought in a problem concerning a new type of paint to absorb
the rays of the sun and convert them into electrical energy Not until
he had studied the problem and given Neil the answer did Mel realize the
full financial potentiality of his powers

He immediately brought up the subjects What about our partnership
agreement on profits he asked

Profits repeated Neil with a nasty smile Why Where did you plan on
going

For once Mel was glad that his voice was flat and devoid of all
inflection It kept the other from sensing the rage that made him want
to do something violent You know what I mean he insisted doggedly
Unless you want to admit murder were still partners

Neil laughed and said Thats right Of course I can draw any and all
funds that I need but if the authorities ever check on your
disappearance theyll find that a separate account has been opened in
your name in the City All you have to do is go in and withdraw it any
time you want to He chuckled then grew serious

Dont get any ideas he warned Weve been spending most of the time
during the past couple of months getting you in shape for your intended
function and Im going to bring more and more problems in to you He
explained further Ive opened an engineering consultant service in the
city and this paint formula alone will bring us all the business well
need He pretended to be busy at one of the computers being installed
but Mel could see that he was glancing out of the corners of his eyes at
the oscilloscope for indication of a brain reaction Mel had learned
several weeks ago that he could control the output of his brain and had
been careful to conceal the fact from Neil

His partner said disappointment in his voice Doesnt my attitude
bother you anymore

Mels mechanical voice rolled out When you destroyed my body you
destroyed all emotions If thats the way you want to do things thats
the way itll be

But the ethics

I know what would happen to me if you turned me over to the scientists
Id be a freak and treated as such I owe nothing to the world

Swell enthused Neil this time his face twisted into a grimace of
pleasure Ive got a lot of plans that youll fit into

Experiments had been made with muscular control and they discovered that
Mel could govern an electrically powered table controlled by short wave
radio Another eye that could swing in a  degree circle had been
mounted on it and broadcast its information to Mels optical circuit A
mechanical arm had also been installed on it and Mel spent long night
hours when the lab was quiet perfecting his control over it Before
long he was as muchif not moreproficient with it as he had been
with his own arms He began laying his plans

The first thing he needed was a weapon Getting his control cart out of
the cubicle was easy since Jenkins the only assistant allowed in the
entire laboratory had left his key ring lying on a table one morning
It had been but the work of a moment to wheel over pick them up and
then conceal them Jenkins had spent a frantic hour in search but
finally went into the machine shop to make up a new set He had first
cautioned Mel against letting Neil know almost fawning in his gratitude
when Mel promised

He searched the entire lab the first two nights but discovered that Neil
had taken the revolver he had kept in a drawer of his old desk It would
take too long to try and machine another one although their machine
shop had proven its capability of turning out anything A knife he
discarded as too clumsy for his means of control He then carefully
considered steel darts shot from a tube by compressed air or carbon
dioxide but reluctantly abandoned that idea also Since he had a
machines limitations as well as advantages hed have to begin thinking
less like a human So the first thing to base a weapon on would be the
material most plentiful in the lab That waselectricity

                                   

Once determined on the line of his endeavors he briefly marvelled again
on the still unexplored potentialities of his brain The weapon would be
mounted on his own cart and electricity could either be broadcast or
selfcontained For mobility he decided on a power pack The weapon
itself evolved so easily that he wondered why no one had thought of it
before now Special type condensers built a battery charge up to over a
million volts for a split second This charge invisible until it hit an
object more solid than air was contained in a very narrow beam by
strong screens of opposite polarity The entire sequence of operation
was almost instantaneous and the bolt was more in the nature of an
electrical projectile than a continuous beam

He decided that the unit resembling a flashlight could be mounted in a
concealed spot under his eye so that it could be fired at whatever he
might be looking at

Now that he had a means of defending himself Mel felt more at ease but
at a loss for his next step Merely eliminating both Jenkins and Neil
would gain his revenge but what then He could always notify the
authorities but mentally flinched at exposing himself to the world as a
freak and being at the mercy of the morbid curiosity of millions

He had hardly begun to lay his plans before disaster struck Neil came
in early one morning and had Mel begin working on a problem concerning a
new type of steel that would combine structural strength with the
lightweight qualities of aluminum Mel energized his calculators that
were electrically practically part of his brain He briefly wondered
why Neil appeared so restless wandering around the room with his hands
behind his back studying everything Then the problem became so
intriguing that he completely forgot that anyone was in the room

His first inkling that anything was wrong was when Neil straightened up
from the cart with a twisted smile on his face and exclaimed

Ha

Mels first startled conjecture was that the other had discovered the
special weapon He tried to rotate the lens so that the weapon would
point at Neil but could see by other stationary lenses in the room
that the one on the cart remained motionless The same was true of the
mechanical arm In fact the entire cart was dead

I pulled the main power fuse said Neil a slight smile on his face
I suppose you thought you were getting away with it completely Not
positive as to how much his partner knew Mel decided on silence as his
defense The smile disappeared from the others face and he continued
slowly

Something must be wrong with your reasoning I knew something was up
when the power companys statement showed an unusually high increase in
power consumption From there on it was easy to read the meters at night
myself and then the next morning What were you up to anyway Mel
still maintained his silence

Okay if thats the way you want it said Neil more harshly He walked
to the end of the tank and Mel felt his brain telegraphing warnings to
severed nerve connections not yet again in use Neil reached out to a
valve Mel recognized as controlling the minute amount of chemicals that
served to nourish the cells in his brain Relays were connected to it
that also regulated the injection of oxygen proportionately into the
fluid He turned it slightly then began watching the oscilloscope
closely In a matter of seconds Mel felt his usually sharp senses begin
to dull The oscilloscope blurred until by great effort he brought it
into focus again He saw that the height of the wavy line denoting the
strength of his brains output was abnormally low

Feeling all right asked Neil in mock anxiety He turned the valve
back to its correct setting and almost instantly Mel felt better
Thats just a sample of what can happen if you force me to it warned
the other A little more of a turn and that super brain of yours would
be garbage Only I wouldnt do that of course There are a few more
experiments I want to make before your brain dies Knowing the vicious
nature of his partner Mel decided to talk before the other goaded
himself into some unplanned action

Dont forget the fable about the goose that laid the golden eggs his
voice rolled out Theres still a lot I could do for you you knowor
not do He saw with relief that the anger receded from the others
face to be replaced by a look of cunning

I almost forgot said Neil Ive another surprise for you He went
to a circuit near the master calculator that he himself had installed
only several days ago All the master components were open a rheostat
appearing to be the primary control Mel had decided at the time it had
to do with voltage regulation of the calculator since there had been
trouble with it

Neil placed his hand on it then turned his head in the general
direction of the tank and said Just in case you get ideas of not
cooperating I can use this for persuasion He cracked the vernier
just a trifle and agony knifed through Mels brain It receded leaving
a slight ache

Not much voltage Neil was saying with satisfaction but judging
from the way your brain wave jumped I dont imagine it felt very good
did it

You win was Mels only comment not wanting another jolt Never
before had he felt so helpless and completely at the mercy of another
He realized more and more that he had less defense than a newborn baby
which could at least kick and wave its hands He could do nothing except
try to retain his sanity and wait for his day to come

Good approved his partner his manner indicating that it was the most
natural thing in the world that Mel should give in Just in case you
forget I think Ill keep the cart disconnected so that you cant do
anything to harm yourself at night His manner abruptly turned
businesslike Now then that paint formula story got around and weve
got a lot of business to handle Most of its routine for you but well
drag it out and sock them plenty A couple of items well copy after
youve solved them and say it couldnt be done

                                   

Mel missed the cart more than he thought he would It was much like the
time when as a boy hed broken a leg and had to stay in bed for
several weeks He was forced to turn in on himself

The real turn in the development of his mind and above the level he had
thought possible came about as an accident one day Resting with
nothing to do he had the full room in vision with the stationary
lenses A flicker of motion caught his attention and careful waiting
disclosed it to be a small mouse that had somehow gained access to the
laboratory and then into his room Welcoming any change in his routine
he watched as the small creature scurried around the room looking for
something to eat Several times Mel amused himself by causing his voice
box to rumble making the rodent scurry around madly for a hiding place
until the imagined danger had passed Eventually it became used to the
noise and not even talking affected it

It disappeared from sight for several minutes and Mel had just begun to
wonder if it had a nest in the equipment when it reappeared on top of
the calculator near the electrical prod that Neil had used on his
brain Remembering the searing jolt it had given him Mel watched
anxiously as the mouse pushed an inquisitive nose into the still exposed
components He became more concerned as the animal became more
intrigued Not only was there danger that the mouse would push down on a
delicate relay and close it but he could conceivably short out the main
power supply The result wasnt pleasant to contemplate If it didnt
permanently damage some of his brain cells the pain might drive him
into insanity

He tried shouting but the mouse paid no attention to him He called for
first Jenkins and then Neil until he remembered that his partner had
said they were going in after some special equipment While he watched
helplessly the mouse stretched out and touched a relay point Instantly
pain knifed through his brain and he became aware of a roaring sound
that he realized was his voice blaring out The extra loud and continued
blast of sound had caused the mouse to withdraw nervously from the
relay Something about it had made him determined however and as Mel
was barely recovering from the first jolt the mouse moved back Mel
wished desperately that the cart had been left in operation so that he
might at least use the sound of motion or the mechanical arm to frighten
his tiny tormentor from the vicinity of the relay

He watched intently as the mouse came closer to the points oblivious to
everything else in the room As it almost touched the points a violent
surge of hate coursed through his brain cells and he was surprised to
see the mouse flung violently back down to the floor It lay there
motionless and he finally realized with thankfulness that it was dead
As the pain from the jolt subsided to the point where he could barely
feel it he began to wonder what had happened The amount of voltage
necessary to hurt him was so small that nothing beyond a direct short
across the primary power would have affected the mouse He began to
analyze everything preceding the point where the mouse had been flung
from the top of the calculator A check and recheck brought the same
answer one that he had at first refused to believehis thoughts had
been responsible

Further contemplation convinced him that while his thoughts had
undoubtedly been responsible the mental power itself had not been
enough as pure brute force to accomplish the task but must have
struck at the rodents brain itself That would have been enough to
convulse the animals muscles and make it look at first as if some
outside force had hurled it to the floor The stolid Jenkins was
somewhat perturbed when he found the dead mouse

But how could it get in here he demanded querulously Then as if in
sudden thought and what could have killed it

Mel suddenly decided that it might be better if the other were set at
ease since even Jenkins could dissect it if he became curious enough and
might find enough to make Neil suspicious

I saw it yesterday he said I didnt say anything since it was
interesting and was company for me I noticed that it was moving more
slowly today and seemed to be weaker It must have starved to death
Nothing to eat in here and he couldnt get out

Yeah agreed the other picking it up and throwing it into a
wastepaper basket The explanation had evidently satisfied him since he
went about his routine tasks

                                   

After the excitement of his discovery had worn off Mel began to
cautiously test its potential He carefully directed his thoughts at
Jenkins and caused an instant reaction For a brief moment he felt a
resilient pressure as if something were pressing against his own brain
He instinctively pushed back harder and heard Jenkins yell as the
opposing pressure collapsed The assistant was leaning against a work
table a dazed look on his face

What happened Mel asked

I dont know said the other pressing a hand to the side of his head
It felt as if something had hit me in the head now it aches a little
Guess Ill have to do something about this cold He left still holding
a hand to his head

It was obvious that his newly discovered power could be dangerous so Mel
proceeded with his experimenting more slowly Jenkins was still his only
guinea pig and he learned to gage just when the assistants resistance
was about to collapse and reduce the intensity of his own probing
accordingly He was disappointed to discover that either it was
impossible to read anothers mind or that he hadnt discovered the
method However he could roughly direct the others actions Jenkins
had been becoming increasingly nervous so Mel became even more subtle in
his experimenting Hed wait until the assistant was idle and then
either make him cross his legs or put one or the other of his hands up
to scratch his head He finally became so smooth and accurate in his
control that it lost most of its interest as a means of recreation

He began to extend his range Wood and concrete offered no impedance at
all Metal with the exception of aluminum cut the intensity roughly
about half Jenkins was in Mels room when he first probed Neils brain
His partners mental resistance was much higher and he pressed slowly
but methodically so that the breakthrough would be controlled To his
surprise he found that Neils brain was much easier to control than
that of Jenkins had been

It was about this time that he found he was beginning to master the
sharing of his hosts eyesight While he might not be able to read
anothers mind it would be a big help to know what someone else was
doing or what he was looking at He tried searching outside the building
but found nothing other than an occasional small spot of resistance
that would probably indicate a small animal This wasnt surprising
since the lab was hidden in caves in a secluded canyon that had no
attraction to the casual wanderer

His next concentration was on the animals he encountered every so often
His first few attempts resulted in sudden and complete collapse of
resistance and he sadly concluded that his control had been too powerful
and resulted in their death He tried more carefully and was overjoyed
when he established contact with their visual senses The sensation was
almost as overpowering as if he had suddenly gained eyesight of his
own For the first time in months he revelled in seeing the country
around the outside of the lab and never before had he thought it so
beautiful Once while in control of a rabbits mind he saw an eagle
flying overhead He quickly transferred and before the bird flew far
enough away to make control impossible he enjoyed the farreaching
vision of the birds eyes as it swept on towards some hidden nest He
could even see the city in the distance

                                   

Several times he neglected to notice Neils entrance into the room so
absorbed did he become in his newly discovered if secondhand freedom

Whats happened to you anyway demanded his erstwhile partner one day
after he had had to repeat a question Half of the time lately youre
lost in a world of your own Whatre you up to anyway

Nothing replied Mel suddenly alert to any new danger although
confident he could take care of himself now I was just going over some
new equations Ive been formulating as a hobby Now that youve taken
away my cart there isnt much to keep me occupied you know You dont
begin to bring enough problems Whats wrong

Mel wished that he could read the others mind since Neil began to act
evasive He laughed with a false heartiness Wrong Why Iveweve
he corrected already made a fortune on a couple of our own patents
as well as commissions from project solutions Someone might get
suspicious if we did too well or too much

This made sense but Mel couldnt resist digging You mean that your
past record of success as measured against your supposed one now might
make the police ask questions he asked The other remained silent so
he pressed the attack Or are they already wondering why I havent been
seen for so long

There were a few questions at first admitted the other but I think
Ive satisfied them all However Ive been thinking that it might be a
good idea to move you somewhere else

But hardly anyone knows the lab exists protested Mel

The power company does even if the meters are way down the road We
shouldve planned on our own generators from the first Then theres the
deed recorder This land is in both of our names you know

Itd still be a tremendous project pointed out Mel You couldnt
begin to keep the new location secret because youd need help in moving
me One little slip and itd be all over

There was an upward curl to the others lips that Mel didnt like Oh
wed have to be careful he admitted Luckily the time delay wouldnt
hurt any theres so much money rolling in He hesitated for a moment
as if in thought then concluded In fact theres no project on now
unless you have a private one of your own It might be a good idea to
plan on the move right away

I still dont like the idea stated Mel flatly Id like to think it
over for a couple of days

Think it over all you want said Neil with a grin He walked to the
calculator and patted it near the jolter Only dont forget I dont
have to ask you He waited almost hopefully but Mel said nothing
content with the feeling of power and knowledge that so long as he was
prepared the other could do nothing immediate to harm him The time had
come for action however

Mel kept mental contact with his partner after he had left Neil went
directly to the office and unlocked the center drawer of his desk He
then began pulling out papers and scanning them rapidly placing some
back and keeping others out Mel gasped to himself when he saw the bank
statement and the amount of money deposited under the name of the
partnership That in Neils personal account was large but it was
perfectly obvious according to dates Mel could see through the others
eyes that the transfer of funds had not been underway for long As it
now stood they were both practically millionaires but he knew Neil
wouldnt be satisfied

Watching through the others eyes Mel had his vision switched from the
desk to the door He saw that Jenkins had just entered mouth moving He
thought he could read his lips just enough to make out his own name
Jenkins appeared to stop and listen to Neil then his facial expression
changed as his lips protested over something Mels vision then switched
to another desk drawer that had been opened and he saw his missing
revolver nesting in it Neil withdrew it and pointed it at Jenkins The
assistant stepped back hands up as if to ward off a blow Then a
placating if anxious smile spread over his face and his mouth worked
rapidly too much so for Mel to read any words Whatever had been said
it appeared to satisfy Neil since he lowered the revolver

                                   

Mel broke contact and came back to his own room and stationary video
scanners that served as his eyes Jenkins came in and his manner made it
plain to Mel that he was laboring under an intense pressure He began
puttering around the work table gradually making his way closer to the
tank housing Mels brain

Jenkins said Mel purposely extra loud

The assistant jumped nervously dropping a piece of metal he had picked
up

Yes he almost quavered

Have you ever thought how it would be to be condemned to a life like
mine

Nooo not especially Why should I

You helped put me here you know

I was only following orders I

All right all right I know how Neil can force a person to do
something But you could help me you know

Hows that suspiciously Im not going to tell anyone if thats
what youre driving at

No Im not trying to get you to do that All I want is the fuse
replaced on the cart Then it would feel as if I were moving around and
break up the monotony This is worse than any solitary cell in prison
could ever be

No refused the assistant flatly It wouldnt do you any good anyway
Its just He stopped hand going to his mouth as if he had said
something he wasnt supposed to

Hows that Jenkins reminded Mel as gently as he could Whats
supposed to happen

I dont know replied Jenkins sullenly

Put a fuse back in the cart directed Mel At the same time he applied
pressure almost to the breaking point against the others mind

No

He knifed through to the others brain with ease and just enough power
to accomplish his purpose without harming Jenkins This was the most
complete control Mel had ever attempted and Jenkins legs moved
spasmodically as though he were a puppet on strings There was horror in
his bulging eyes and sweat began breaking out on his forehead
Relentlessly he was forced towards the cart until at last it had been
reached

Jenkins said Mel as low as he could Can you hear me A slight
twitch of the head was the only indication that he could so Mel
instructed

Theres a spare fuse near the holder Jenkins Take it out and place it
in the primary circuit Do that and Ill let you go If need be I could
kill you now The fuse Jenkins He relaxed his hold slightly but
Jenkins made no attempt to comply Mel continued

Remember the dead mouse Jenkins I did that The fuse before I lose
my patience He applied more power until the others hand began moving
unsteadily towards the cart As he withdrew slightly from mental
contact Jenkins continued his task and in a moment Mel was able to move
the cart He had momentarily forgotten Jenkins until he became aware
that the assistant had let out a yell of terror and was rushing for the
door Mel watched with amusement knowing that he could have stopped the
other with hardly a strain Just before he reached the door it opened
and Neil appeared Jenkins came to a halt and stared in terror at his
employer

Well said the other impatiently Whats been keeping you Jenkins
Did you

No he didnt answered Mel At the same time he caused the cart to
move sideways and swung the video scanner until it was staring directly
at Neil

Well said the latter accusingly switching his gaze to the terrified
Jenkins So this is how you follow out orders

He made me do it boss He made me babbled Jenkins as Neil face set
with determination drew his revolver from a pocket Before the
astounded Mel could do more than gaze incredulously there were two
sharp cracks and Jenkins slowly placed his arms around his stomach and
rocked back and forth in agony before toppling over to the floor to lie
motionless

Now you said Neil swinging his revolver towards Mels tank Mel
frantically stabbed at his partners mind but could feel no pressure
Another shot rang out and he felt a numbing pressure seemingly from
every direction that could only mean it was against his physical brain
itself The shock forced him to use every bit of power he possessed to
keep conscious Neil had lowered the revolver a trifle and was saying in
a superior tone

Whatever you did to Jenkins its only hastened the inevitable if that
makes you feel any better Id have had to get rid of him too once you
were disposed of

He began raising the revolver again and the dazed Mel instinctively
relayed power to the cart The eye had been pointing directly at Neil
and the only sound that indicated the energy gun had been set off was a
slight hiss The effect on Neil was not only instantaneous but horrible
to see His body appeared to swell until he looked bloated then
disintegrated

                                   

Mel felt himself becoming weak and hastily brought the cart over to
examine the damage the one shot had done to him Almost fearfully he
scanned himself and saw with relief that the shot had penetrated the
tank and was letting the lifegiving liquid escape onto the floor A
quick glance into the tank showed that the lead pellet had missed his
brain but the pressure on the liquid had caused him the initial pain

He directed the cart over to the work bench and brought back a tapered
piece of wood The arm placed it into the hole and then applied pressure
until the trickle had stopped It would do until he could effect a
permanent patch He began to feel stronger almost immediately and knew
that the automatic features of his metal body were renewing the liquid
at top speed

Using the cart he first checked the supply of chemicals fed as needed
into the tank and saw that there was a sufficient quantity to last him
for at least a month He thanked the good fortune that had allowed
Jenkins to put the cart into operation before it was too late Without
it his end would have been as certain as if Neil had been successful in
killing him

His first task was to construct several more carts each complete with
video scanner One of them was larger than the other Its first task
was to dispose of the two putrefying bodies Working almost  hours a
day he hooked an intercommunications system to every room of the
underground lab and directly into his system Even the telephone was
connected to it so that if necessary he could answer it or make a
call

The day finally arrived when there was no more he could do The entire
lab was almost like a steel and concrete body so thoroughly had its
every function been integrated as part of his brain The decision he had
been almost frantically avoiding could no longer be put aside He had
approximately a week in which to decide It would be simple to call the
police and in turn let them notify the various scientists as to his
position

He dreaded the thought of the circus that the lab would become
Erstwhile friends would troop in to look at him with morbid curiosity
Then when his potential became known tasks would be assigned There was
a definite possibility that he would be moved even at the danger of
injury to himself Countless thousands would demand it and their will
would be obeyed unless the curtain of national security could be drawn
across him

One day was spent in contacting the animals outside the lab and
revelling in flight for awhile Then he sped through the countryside
first with a coyote then with a deer There was a possibility that if
the scientists moved him his new tank would be shielded so that it
would be impossible to enjoy himself as he now was All in the name of
science of course

On the other hand if it were possible to have all supplies delivered to
a nearby point where he could pick them up he could continue his
present method of existence His mind jumped eagerly from problem to
problem which he could undoubtedly solve for the benefit of mankind The
present patents in the partnerships name would bring enough money
indefinitely to pursue them since much could be done by pure thought

There was the survival phase first He would devise an electronic
blanketing ray that would dampen all atomic explosions Then he could
turn to the health of people all over the world wipe out diseases All
this would depend of course on his being able to remain undisturbed and
that might tax his powers to their utmost He wondered if it would be
worth the effort

Finally he had less than three days left which narrowed the safety
margin to the lowest point he cared to think about He opened the
telephone circuit and heard the operator say Number please

He hesitated briefly then said

The Waring Chemical Supply House please His order was soon placed
and afterwards he felt almost as free and elated as when as a boy
school had let out for the summer The manual dexterity of the metallic
fingers he had constructed would enable him to write checks with his own
signature A faint idea had even tickled his curiosity and he felt
certain that he could grow cells within a couple of weeks From there
he could work on a body for himself one even more efficient than the
old one Neil had destroyed

A human in the lab at that moment would have been startled As near
possible as it was for any wheeled vehicle to do so he had several
carts almost doing a jig in the main office His new life had just
begun
