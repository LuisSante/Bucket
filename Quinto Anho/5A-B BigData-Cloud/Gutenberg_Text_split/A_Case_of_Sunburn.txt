                           A CASE OF SUNBURN

                        BY CHARLES L FONTENAY

                 In the past year the Martian rebels
                 had been pushed back to the wall All
                 that was left to them was Plan Blue
                     And what was Plan Blue

Jonners hand dropped to his pistol and he edged cautiously behind a
big rock as another groundcar appeared among the dunes to the south and
approached the little group of men He was sure Sir Stanrich had told
him there were to be four others in his little task force and there
were four with him now

But the new groundcar did not approach like a hostile patrol car There
was an air of confidence about the way its driver swung it up to the
others Jonner held his hand thinking furiously as the airtight door
swung open and the newcomer leaped lightly to the ground

The sun was settling over the ironred wastes of the Isidis Desert The
groundcars clustered like giant beetles at the top of the cliff that
dropped straight down to the shadowed lowland of Syrtis Major The six
men in marsuits huddled at rendezvous kept their helmet radios low
for Mars City was less than fifty miles east of them

With the twilight the blue mist of Mars was beginning to settle toward
the ground

Jonner debated with himself Could he have misunderstood Sir Stanrich
Or could the plans have been changed after he left the Isidis
spaceport No Then who was the sixth man And which man was he

Regina fell right after I left said the burly grayhaired man
That would be Tyruss the former space captain who had come here from
Regina Our troops were falling back along the Hadriacum Lowland I
suppose they plan to make a stand before Charax

No Charax is to be evacuated tonight said Jonner and savored the
shock of that announcement on his hearers

He studied the credentials each man had handed him on arrival There
was Tyruss from Regina There was Farlan an astrogator from the
Rebel defenses in the Strymon Canals and there was Aron who had just
arrived a space engineer from the Hadriacum front There were Stein
an astrogator and Wessfeld an engineer who had come together in one
groundcar from Charax

The credentials were all alike except the names But one of them
wasmust bea Marscorp spy

                                   

Jonner could not check with Sir Stanrich by radioMars City was
too close and they would be overheard He had no time to spend
investigating his personnelSir Stanrich had impressed on him that
their mission must be carried out on schedule

He decided he would not tell them just yet that one of them could not
be trusted He might be able to trip the spy But he said

One or more of us may be killed or captured so Im going to brief
everyone No matter how many of us are lost those who are left must
carry out the mission What were you told about this

I was told to meet you here and follow your instructions I was told
its a dangerous and important assignment Thats all said Tyruss
The others murmured agreement

The instructions I give you wont be mine but those of Sir Stanrich
OKellin supreme commander of the Rebel forces said Jonner He
squatted on the sand and the others crowded around in the blue twilight
as he sketched diagrams with his gloved hand while he talked

As some of you may have learned the Charax Rebellion is in danger of
collapsing because our supplies have been running out since Marscorp
intercepted and destroyed our last space fleet from Earth Plan Red
which was our master plan for defeating Marscorp in the field by
capturing the domecities one by one has failed Regina and Charax are
being evacuated because we couldnt hold them much longer anyway and
all our people are being transported around the Marscorp territory to
the secret underground spaceport we established in the Isidis Desert
two years ago

This is a temporary measure to prepare for Plan Blue our lastgasp
emergency plan Marscorp will no doubt find the location of the
underground base by observation of the refugees but we hope to
have Plan Blue in operation before they can shift their forces from
Hadriacum to the desert and break through our defenses

Ive heard rumors of this Plan Blue said Farlan a slight man with
blond hair What is it

I dont know conceded Jonner candidly I dont think anyone does
but Sir Stanrich and a few of our top strategists But our part of it
is this

You may not know it but we lost our last Gboat when we pulled that
unsuccessful attack on Phobos early this year We do have an old
spaceship riding in a polar orbit that Marscorp doesnt know about
but no way to get up to it Our job is to capture a Marscorp Gboat
get to that spaceship capture The Egg and tow it into an Earthward
orbit

The Egg repeated Stein a dark chubby fellow You mean that ovoid
space station of Marscorps with the antennae sticking out all over it
Ive seen that thing floating up there I always wondered why we didnt
blast it

Not important enough said Jonner Its an experimental laboratory
that amplifies the magnetic field of Mars and theyve been
experimenting with it as an auxiliary power station But neither side
is bothered by any lack of power from the atomic energy sources on
Mars

Tyruss appeared annoyed at this

Tell me something Jonner he demanded If it wasnt important
enough to blast when we had the ships to do it why is it important
enough for us to capture now

I dont know said Jonner Those are our orders Now we leave the
groundcars here and go on foot to Marsport Check equipment everyone

Say commented Farlan after a moment I dont seem to have any
sunburn lotion

You can have mine said Aron laughing This far from the sun I
havent been sunburned yet and dont expect to be

Havent been on Mars a year yet have you suggested Tyruss

No admitted Aron I came from Earth with the last space fleet and
escaped in a lifeboat Why

Theres an Earthsun conjunction coming up Every time the Earth
swings between Mars and the sun everybody on Mars gets a bad sunburn
When it comes you better cover yourself with lotion because clothes
dont protect you and even if youre in a city the domes and house
roofs are transparent to pick up the suns heat

We have enough among us said Jonner Besides if our mission goes
off on schedule well be back at base by the time the Earthsun
conjunction starts Lets head for Marsport

                                   

The six men crouched in the concealing canal sage near the edge of
Marsport the spaceport outside Mars City The blue mist was a heavy
fog that swirled around them

In the lighted circle of the spaceport area three stubby twostage
gravityboats sat upright about a hundred yards apart These were the
heavy duty rockets that plied back and forth to Phobos Mars inner
moon and Marscorps natural space station entering the planetary
atmosphere of Mars where spaceships could not go Workmen stirred
busily around one of the Gboats a guard stood at the entrance port of
each of the other two

Jonner tried to assess the evidence to decide which of his five
companions was the Marscorp spy How Marscorp had found out about the
expedition how the credentials had been forged how the rendezvous had
been learned did not matter now Marscorp could not know their plans
beyond the rendezvous in the desert because only he and Sir Stanrich
had known the orders Sir Stanrich had given him for this mission

The fact that Stein and Wessfeld had arrived together from Charax
eliminated them as suspects for the Charax command would have known
whether one or two men were to be sent from there

Jonner did not believe Tyruss was the spy Jonner had won his space
papers just before the Rebellion began but it was logical that Sir
Stanrich would send a more experienced space captain to handle their
ship

That left Farlan and Aron from different sections of the Hadriacum
front Which one In their specialties Farlan was an alternate to
Stein as an astrogator Aron an alternate to Wessfeld as an engineer
But every spaceman could handle every other spacemans duties in an
emergency and it was hard to say which task they had decided to double
up on

Jonner expected the spy to make some move here tonight and he had
prepared for it on the way from the desert One earphone of his helmet
receiver was tuned with his speaker to the Rebel band they used
the other was tuned to the local frequency used by Marscorp Jonner
listened with one ear to the occasional reports and orders that were
passed around the spaceport

Jonner punched Tyruss next to him twice on the shoulder It was the
signal The six men rose and moved forward together

The sentry who loomed before them had no chance A heatgun beam is
invisible They cut him down and scurried to the edge of the spaceport
into the circle of light running in long leaps toward the nearest
Gboat

It was as they broke from the canal sage that the thing happened which
Jonner had expected The words were shouted into the earphone attuned
to the Marscorp band Attention Marscorp Att

Jonner pressed a button on his belt and his other defense went
into action A scrambler beam cut in on the attempted warning and
everything on that channel dissolved into a buzzing roar

Jonner cast a glance down the line of his companions but they were too
far separated for him to see whether any of them was talking into his
helmet microphone

Some of the workmen at the far Gboat saw them running across the
field and scattered in alarm but the scrambling prevented them from
warning others through helmet communicators The guard at the Gboat
that was their goal saw them when they were fifty feet away He was cut
down as he tried to duck around the Gboat

They ran up the ramp Jonner first to reach the port stopped and
tried to watch his companions as they hurried past him Tyruss was
fumbling at some control on the belt of his marsuit His radio channel
control

Armed men were converging on the Gboat from all over the field as
Jonner slammed and fastened the port They scrambled up to the nose of
the Gboat and he and Tyruss sank into the pilots seats

Strap down for blastoff shouted Jonner and wished viciously that
the spy would still be tuned on the Marscorp band and fail to hear him
But everyone strapped down hurriedly

A score of Marscorp soldiers were standing around the Gboat firing
up at its ports with heatguns The beams were futile for Gboats
were built to stand frictional temperatures it would take a heatgun
minutes to build to Halfway across the field a squad of men wheeled
an antitank gun into position

The gentle gravity of Mars quadrupled as the Gboat strained upward
on roaring jets gathering speed Through the port Jonner saw the
antitank guns muzzle elevate and blossom flame There was no impact
and there was no opportunity for another shot

The Gboat curved eastward in a long ascending arc The first stage
dropped off over the Aerian Desert and in a few moments they were in
free fall

                                   

Jonner unstrapped and floated to each man in turn examining his
control belt Farlans channel dial was a fraction off the band they
used

Farlan your radio controls off center said Jonner quietly

What said Farlans voice blurred a little He fumbled at the dial
and his words came in clearly Must have hit it against something

Or he could have missed a little when he returned the dial to channel
after trying to warn Marscorp But Tyruss had been fumbling with
something on his belt as they ran onto the Gboat No it wouldnt do
to make an accusation against the wrong man

An automatic calendar on the Gboats control board showed the date
upright the Martian date Aster   reversed the Earth date
June  

Jonner looked down through the port at the inhabited hemisphere of Mars
unfolding below them Those green lowlands those red deserts now
were all in Marscorp handseven the cradle of the Charax Rebellion
the domecity of Charax at the edge of the edge of the Tiphys Fretum
Lowland in the south polar area

There six Martian years ago the rebellion had flared bravely against
the Mars Corporation Marscorp had held a monopoly on space travel
between Earth and Mars since the first Martian colony was established
at Mars City in the Earth year  For the supplies Marscorp brought
from Earth the price was kept high Marscorp also was the OGMthe
Official Government of Mars or as the colonists read the initials
Old Greedy Marscorpand Marscorp made and enforced the laws

It had been a fairly even match at first Marscorps initial monopoly
of the supply lines had been overcome when many of the people on Earth
were roused to sympathy for the Rebel cause Gradually the Rebels had
invested much of the Hadriacum Lowland with its domefarms and had
captured Regina another of the planets six domecities

That had been before the disastrous space battle of the year  Now
in the past year the Rebels had been pushed back to the wall All that
was left to them was Plan Blue And what was Plan Blue

Jonner looked over his five companions All helmets were off now and
Jonner couldnt detect a guilty look in any face He had never seen
such pure unanimity of apparent innocence and loyalty

Now that were aspace well go on the customary shifts he said
eight hours duty eight hours sleep eight hours free time Well pair
off Stein with Farlan Wessfeld with Aron Tyruss with me

And these are special orders no one is to let the man with whom he is
paired out of his sight

He would not tell them more than that now he hoped to trap the spy
when they approached The Egg

                                   

The spaceship slid up orbit overtaking the shining ovoid from which
antennae sprouted like pins from a pincushion The captured Gboat was
lashed to the spaceships side

Youd think theyd have some defenses anyhow grumbled Tyruss
watching the ovoid on the screen

Why countered Jonner They knew we didnt have any Gboats left
and they didnt know we had any spaceships left either Of course
they dont know this is our target but Ill bet they have some ships
from Phobos on the way here now anyhow

Their timing was just right Thirty minutes later The Egg would swing
around the limb of Mars in line of sight with Marsport But so far
there had been no chance for The Egg to receive a radio warning of the
stolen Gboat

The spaceship pulled abreast of The Egg and Jonner and Tyruss went
across to it in spacesuits They passed through the airlock to find The
Eggs crew of three waiting with welcoming smiles The smiles faded at
the sight of their levelled heatguns

Sorry you werent expecting us said Jonner opening the faceplate
of his spacesuit with his left hand Youll have to get into
spacesuits

They sent their captives through the airlock and across the
intervening space to the spaceship where the others would be awaiting
them Then Jonner and Tyruss searched The Egg for other Marscorp
personnel They found none

Wed better get a line on her and get under way before those ships
from Phobos can get here said Tyruss

Right agreed Jonner and they got busy

A towline secured between the two vessels Jonner and Tyruss returned
to the spaceship The three Marscorp captives had been secured by
chains to stanchions on the storage deck just above the engine deck
Stein and Farlan the engineers were standing by

Were getting under way Tyruss told them

Stein and Farlan descended to the engine deck and Tyruss and Jonner
climbed to the control deck On the centerdeck Aron and Wessfeld the
astrogators were asleep

Tyruss climbed into the control chair and switched the radio to the
Marscorp band A voice blared from the communicator

Marscorp calling The Egg Marscorp calling The Egg Come in Egg Can
you hear us Egg Rebels captured Gboat here Double alert Marscorp
calling

Tyruss switched it off laughing

A little late he commented

Yes said Jonner Keep the receiver on that band Tyruss because we
wont be hearing from our side But until we finish our mission Im
going to disconnect the sending equipment

Jonner floated to the other side of the control deck and moved around
behind the control board He was busy disconnecting wires a few
minutes later when he heard an exclamation from Tyruss

He peeked around the edge of the control board The three Marscorp
captives were floating up the companionway from below heatguns in
their hands

Keep your hands off those controls Reb warned one of them This
ships staying right here

Wasnt there another one in this gang Robbo asked another

Tyruss twisted in his chair and reached for his heatgun One of the
Marscorp men rayed him through the throat

Cautiously Jonner poked the muzzle of his heatgun around the edge
of the control board Methodically he shot the three Marscorp men
one by one They died without discovering the source of the invisible
heatbeam that cut them down

Tyruss was dead Cursing Jonner went below heatgun in hand On the
centerdeck Wessfelds body floated Wessfeld was dead burned through
the chest Aron was not there

He found all three of the others locked in the airlock without
spacesuits Jonner watched Aron suspiciously as they emerged

What happened he demanded of Aron

I dont know disclaimed Aron They woke us up They had heatguns
then Wessfeld tried to reach his and they shot him Stein and Farlan
were already in the airlock when they brought me down

Stein were you and Farlan constantly in sight of each other
as ordered asked Jonner watching Aron Did Arons eyes widen
apprehensively

Stein started

Why no he admitted Farlan was on the engine deck and I was
down in the airlock checking the spacesuits before blastoff Thats
routine you know They herded Farlan down and caught me by surprise

Thats right said Farlan I was checking the engines when they came
through the hatch from above with heatguns

Damn exploded Jonner I gave everyone strict ordersall right
its too late now It just cost us two men and one of the four of
us left is a Marscorp spy Everyone get above and strap down for
acceleration

The spy was Aron or Farlan but he still didnt know which Aron could
have feigned sleep and slipped down to the storage deck to release
and arm the Marscorp men Or Farlan could have climbed from the engine
deck and done it while Stein was in the airlock Whoever it was he had
chosen to be locked in with the othersprobably in case the sortie
failed

Now they were two men short and still he would have to pair off with
Aron and pair Stein with Farlan They would have to go on twelvehour
duty shifts with only four hours free time

And to what purpose As Tyruss had suggested several times why
couldnt they have just blasted The Egg out of space if the purpose
was to get rid of it Why go to all the trouble of shifting it to an
Earthward orbit The Earth would be nowhere near the intersection point
when The Egg reached Earths orbit if that made any difference

Jonner had at last let the others know as he should have before that
one of them was a spy But he would not tell them as he had told
Tyruss that he had disconnected the radio transmitter Let the spy try
to get in touch with Marscorp now

                                   

Jonner said Aron there are a couple of blips on the radar screen
that shouldnt be there

Jonner swung the control chair to look at the screen There were two
dots there almost directly to the rear of the spaceship Jonner
watched them They held their position on the screen

I dont know he said Pretty large for meteors and there doesnt
seem to be any lateral movement

Their ship had just begun acceleration following a hyperbola that
would break them free of Mars gravity It was a hyperbola that swung
the ship against the direction of the planets orbital travel and
while speeding the ship away from the planet slowed it in relation to
the sun

Jonner and Aron were on duty on the control deck Stein and Farlan
slept on the centerdeck below Two hour periods had passed since
they captured The Egg and maneuvered it into the right orbit for their
departure from the Martian area

The blips grew on the screen and still they did not move laterally

Spaceships Jonner decided

Theyre following our course and overtaking us

Marscorp ships exclaimed Aron But Jonner we never were in radar
range of any Marscorp ship or installation How could they know our
position and course

Without replying Jonner arose from the control chair and went around
behind the control board The wires to the radio transmitter which he
had disconnected so carefully had been reconnected

Aron said Jonner coming back to the control chair go down and
chain Farlan to his bunk Hes our Marscorp spy

He is Arons eyes widened How do you know

Because you havent been out of my sight since we took The Egg in tow
and you havent been near that control board while we were on duty
Stein must have let Farlan get away from him again

Why not Stein

You forget Stein and Wessfeld arrived together from Charax at the
rendezvous They had to be clean

Aron unstrapped and arose

Shouldnt we boost acceleration and try to evade them he asked
gesturing at the radar screen

We cant now said Jonner Were on an escape hyperbola and weve
got to hold this acceleration until she runs out or wed throw it
completely off

Aron went below Jonner watched the screen anxiously The Marscorp
ships must have set an interception course for their acceleration was
much too high to be following their own escape orbit They were getting
closer rapidly

Jonner looked at the chronometer and at the tape still ticking through
the ships control mechanism Eleven minutes was a brief time but
it seemed long when enemy ships were overtaking them at twice their
acceleration

Towing The Egg this old ship could not match the Marscorp attackers
acceleration It could accelerate much faster than it was but if he
was to hit the Earthward orbit he had been ordered to take he would
have to hold his present acceleration until the eleven minutes was up

And the Marscorp ships got closer by the minute

                                   

Aron climbed back to the control deck from below

Farlans tied up and hes madder than hell Aron reported Stein
said Farlan did go behind the control board on their last duty
stretch to adjust the radio Whats the situation now

Theyve started decelerating to match our pace when they get abreast
of us said Jonner indicating the rocket flares that now appeared on
the aft visual screen

The tape suddenly ran out and the rockets roar faded They were in
free fall again

Get into a spacesuit and cut that towline commanded Jonner Were
going to make a run for it

Were not going to stay and guard The Egg asked Aron getting a suit
off one of the hooks

No outside guns This hulk was a supply ship As soon as you get
back in and secure the outer airlock holler and well start partial
acceleration When youve strapped down somewhere below holler again
and well blow the tubes

While Aron went below to carry out his assignment Jonner swung the
ship endto with the gyroscopes He prayed silently that the towline
to The Egg wouldnt foul Theyd have to head back toward Mars for
further acceleration in this direction would throw them helpless in a
path toward outer space

The radio loudspeaker boomed

OGM ship Phobos to Rebel spaceship Stand by for boarding or get
blasted

The Marscorp ships were within a few miles now slowing to match the
pace of the Rebel ship

The outer airlock warning light flashed red then green again

Ready said Arons voice on the ships communicator

Jonner flicked his radio transmitter to the Marscorp beam

Go to hell he announced and depressed the firing buttons

It was uncomfortable for Aron climbing out of the airlock but Jonner
threw the ship into a full G acceleration The Marscorp ships loomed
suddenly to each side then faded behind them A few futile flashes of
gunfire blossomed from their noses Then rings of fire appeared behind
them as they gave chase

Strapped down called Aron and Jonner gave the rockets full blast

The ship leaped like a frantic old warhorse Jonner was pressed down
heavily in his control chair Its beams and plates groaned as G was
piled on G

The Egg was gone from the rearward screens released and floating free
in an Earthward orbit The Marscorp ships fell farther behind Then
they stopped receding and began to grow on the screens again Newer and
more powerful they were overtaking the Rebel ship

Suddenly the ships rockets ceased firing again and they were in free
fall A moment later Aron popped up from below

Are we hit he asked

No they arent back in range yet answered Jonner Were out of
fuel Maybe its just as well they came along because I dont believe
this clunk had enough fuel to overtake Mars again even if we hadnt
blown it in that escape try

The Marscorp attackers apparently interpreted the Rebel ships dead
rocket tubes as a surrender Within half an hour they had drawn
alongside and armed men in spacesuits came through the airlock Farlan
was freed of his chains and Jonner Stein and Aron were herded onto
the centerdeck of one of the Marscorp ships and secured to stanchions

The Marscorp captain floated before them looking them over quizzically

I dont know what you fellows were trying to prove but youre lucky
he said If you hadnt cut your rockets when you did wed have
blasted you out of space

Jonner answered out of the knowledge that no ships which had
accelerated as these two had in the past hour would have more than
enough fuel left to get them back to Phobos The Egg trailing far
behind Mars now would overtake the planet gradually as the pull of the
sun sped it up but it would pass Mars well to sunward in its plunge
toward the orbit of Earth Any ship that tried to intercept it from
Mars now would fight increasing solar gravity and would run the risk of
not getting back to Mars

Well we accomplished our mission anyhow Jonner said resignedly
for whatever its worth

A fools mission said the Marscorp captain and Jonner was inclined
to agree with him The Egg was an experimental laboratory and an
auxiliary power station and we can build another cheaper than we could
recover it As for you fellows youre better off than you realize

Hows that asked Stein

Why if you arent tried as war criminals you ought to be freed
pretty quickly According to the latest news reports from Mars City
our armies are driving your people back into your underground base in
the Isidis Desert The war will be over as soon as weve cracked that

                                   

Jonner Stein and Aron lay around in the Marscorp brig on Phobos for
more than a month To be precise they floated around for Phobos had
little more surface gravity than a spaceship in orbit When there was
no indication they were going to be transferred from Phobos Jonner
set up a howl that at last was heard in the little moons officialdom

Jonner was taken before the adjutant of the Phobos base to air his
complaint

Look said Jonner placing both hands belligerently on the officials
desk the terms of the terrestrial Space Compact apply to Mars too
No prisoners of war shall be confined beyond a planetary atmosphere
except for so long as it is impracticable for them to be transferred to
a surface prison

That provision was written into the compact to permit inspection by
neutral powers and because ordinarily a prisoner has some hope that
a surface prison will be overrun by troops of his own side and he will
be released answered the adjutant mildly peering at Jonner over
oldfashioned rimless spectacles In your case thats not likely to
happen and I cant see why youre raising such a fuss The last we
heard up here our troops were about to overrun your last base

What do you mean the last you heard demanded Jonner I heard that
two days before we were brought to Phobos

Radio communication with Mars has been out completely explained the
adjutant goodnaturedly Statics always bad during the Earthsun
conjunctions as you ought to know being a spaceman This time we
havent been able to get anything through at all

Well maybe its true that weve lost and the wars about over
said Jonner But the three of us still want to be transferred to the
surface Free fall can drive you nuts when youre in an eightbyeight
cell

As a matter of fact said the adjutant there hasnt been any
Gboat traffic to and from the surface since the radio went out Its
a dangerous business trying to land at a spaceport without any radio
guide But we have to send a Gboat down for supplies in a couple of
days and if you fellows are insistent about it well send you down to
Marsport on it

It was not two days but more than a week later that the three of them
were allowed to get into spacesuits and were escorted out to a Gboat
anchored to the surface of Phobos

Above them the orange disc of Mars filled the sky Phobos was swinging
across the inhabited hemisphere now and the dark green areas of Syrtis
and Hadriacum were plainly visible

Jonner strained his eyes upward at the red spot that was the Isidis
Desert Somewhere in the heart of that red spot Sir Stanrich OKellin
was directing the lastgasp stand of the Charax Rebels They would be
manning the underground chambers of the base perhaps fighting in the
corridors as the Marscorp troops battled to effect an entry

It might even be that the base had fallen by now overrun by the
government forces and he and his companions would be technically
free men by the time they landed at Marsport Jonner sighed unhappily
He didnt want that kind of freedom

Following Stein and Aron he climbed into the Gboat It had a crew of
two plus an armed guard for the prisoners

Therell be no unstrapping during free fall announced the Gboat
pilot Everybody will remain strapped down until we land With the
Earthsun conjunction over weve reestablished radio communication
partially but its spotty and we may crash

Is the war over asked Jonner

How the hell should I know grunted the pilot We havent had a
single news broadcast that makes sense since the radio came back in
Theyre all chopped up with static

The Gboat lifted gently from the surface of Phobos and began its
spiral downward toward Mars The six men crowded together in its
single passenger compartment listened to the radio that spat and
growled over their heads

What they heard was unintelligible

Sector Four  squawk  spsst snarled the loudspeaker
Colonel  squawk  troops in  squawk  move tank squad
to  spsstcrackcrack more ambulances  squawk  ninety
per cent disabled

Periodically the pilot tried to establish contact

Gboat MC to Marsport Gboat MC to Marsport Come in Marsport

The attempts were futile until the Gboat had entered the atmosphere
and was gliding high above the desert on its broad wings Then
miraculously the airwaves were clear for a moment

Marsport to Gboat MC said the loudspeaker Go ahead

Gboat MC to Marsport said the pilot hurriedly Give us a beam
Were coming in for a landing

Dont land Were exclaimed the loudspeaker and exploded into
static in midsentence

What the hell do they mean dont land snorted the pilot fiddling
frantically and uselessly with dials They think Ive got enough fuel
to get back to Phobos

The Gboat held its glide and swooped down on Marsport a tiny landing
field and a miniature group of buildings set apart from the dome of
Mars City Groups of men were scurrying about at the port like ants A
column of smoke rose ominously from one of the buildings

The Gboat touched ground and skidded to a stop in midfield Its
passengers unstrapped and the pilot opened the port

Men crowded into the Gboat men with drawn heatguns men in the
blueandgold marsuits of the Charax Rebels

                                   

Jonner a free man again rode into Mars City in a groundcar with Sir
Stanrich OKellin Stein and Aron had remained at Marsport for the time
being Marsport was completely in the hands of the Rebels and efforts
were being made to get through by radio to Phobos to give the Marscorp
forces there a surrender ultimatum

Whats happened to the Mars City dome asked Jonner in astonishment
as they approached the city The oncetransparent dome was cracked and
badly discolored

Plan Blue answered Sir Stanrich with a smile

Look sir how about telling me what happened said Jonner When we
got captured in the middle of our wild goose chase with Marscorps Egg
our troops had been driven into the ground at the Isidis base and we
got the impression it was only a matter of time before that fell Then
the radio goes out for a few days and we land here to find Mars City
overrun with our troops

Why said Sir Stanrich his mustache quirking mischievously we
counterattacked We came out of the base defeated the Marscorp army
there drove across the desert to Mars City and took it Task forces
are out now taking over the other cities Thats all there is to it

Simple snorted Jonner Except that they outnumbered us four or five
to one and probably outgunned us more than that

Science wins wars now my boy not numbers and guns

They had entered the Mars City airlock and were driving down the broad
Avenue of the Canals Rebel soldiers swarmed through the city The few
men and women they saw in Marscorp uniforms staggered around groping
blindly their faces and arms fiery red and peeling from sunburn

Youll get a medal out of it too commented Sir Stanrich

Why Why me

Because you followed orders even though your mission appeared
useless It was your wild goose chase that made our victory possible

You see only the blue mist of Mars protects its surface from the hard
rays of the sun Without it wed have no more protection than a naked
man in space The reason were in for a bad sunburn every year is that
the blue mist dissipates partially at every Earthsun conjunction

But what would The Egg have to do with that asked Jonner

The Egg amplifies the effect of magnetic fields the way a lens
concentrates light rays answered Sir Stanrich Its the Earths
magnetic field not that of Mars that interferes with the blue mist
every time the Earth passes between Mars and the sun And to amplify
Earths magnetic field we had to place The Egg directly between Mars
and Earth during the Earthsun conjunctionand you put it there when
you got the Egg into an Earthward orbit on schedule

But Sir Stanrich Ive been sunburned a dozen times at these
conjunctions

Not like this When the blue mist was stripped away completely this
time everyone on the surface was affected Marscorps troops were
put out of action as an effective fighting force when they received
severe burns over most of their bodies and were afflicted with acute
conjunctivitis so badly they were half blinded Thats why we abandoned
Charax and Regina and pulled all our people to the Isidis base while
the conjunction was under way we were all protected from the sun 
underground

They had reached the center of the city Above the old Syrtis Major
Hotel which had served as Marscorps supreme headquarters the flag
of the Charax Rebels was fluttering in the breeze from the citys air
circulators

Marscorp was beaten Mars was free
