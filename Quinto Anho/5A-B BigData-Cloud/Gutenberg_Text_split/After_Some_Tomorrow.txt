                     race from extinctionbut he
                      was the clans only husband
                     and had to be protected from
                          his own folly

Before the first shots rang out Alan had been sitting with some twenty
young people of the Wolf clan in a grove of aspen approximately half
way between the fields and the citadel on the hilltop He had been
teaching them mythlegend and as usual the girls were bored and
unbelieving the boys open mouthed

He realized even as he spoke that the telling had changed even
since his own youth As a boy of ten before it was definitely known
whether or not he was a sterilie he had sat at the feet of the Turtle
clans husband as open mouthed as those who sat at his feet now But
the telling was different Now had he spoken openly of when men bore
weapons and women lived at home with the children he would have
crossed the boundaries of decency It hadnt been so in his own youth
but then when he was a boy they had been one generation nearer to
the old days which werent so far back after all

Helen complained This is so silly Alan Why dont you tell us
something about  well about hunting or true fighting

He looked at her Could this be a daughter of his Tall for her
fourteen years and straight clear of eye aggressive and brooking of
no nonsense The old books told of the femininity of women but

The shots went bang bang bang from below faint in the half mile
or more of distance And then bang bang again and several booms
from the new muzzle loading muskets

Helen was on her feet first her eyes flashing Instantly she was in
command Alan she snapped Quick to the citadel All of you boys
hurry To the citadel

She whirled to her older classmates Ruth Margo Jenny Paula Get
stones sharp stones You younger girls go with Alan See if you can
help at the citadel Well come last Hurry Alan

Alan was already off herding the boys before him Possibly all of them
were sterilies and so wouldnt count But you never knew

As they climbed the hill he looked back over his shoulder Down in the
fields he could see the workers scattering for their weapons and for
cover One stumbled and was down In the distance he couldnt make out
whether she had fallen accidentally or been wounded Further beyond the
fields he could see the smoke from a half dozen or more places where
the shots had originated It didnt seem to be an attack in force

Not far up the hill from the field workers on a overhanging boulder in
a lookout position he could make out Vivian the scout chief She sat
seemingly in unconcerned ease one elbow supported on a knee as her
telescoped rifle went crack crack crack If he knew Vivian there
was more than one casualty among the raiders

Who could it be this time Deer from the south Coyote or Horse from
the east Possibly Eagles Crows or Dogs from Denver way The clan
couldnt stand much more of this pressure It was the third raid in six
months They couldnt stand it and put in a crop nor could the drain
on the arsenal be maintained He had heard that the Turtle clan near
Colorado Springs the clan of his birth had got to the point where
they were using bows and arrows even for defense If so it wouldnt be
long before they would be losing their husband

He was puffing somewhat by the time they reached the citadel Helen
and her four girls were coming much more slowly watching the progress
of the fight below them keeping their eyes peeled for a possible
break through of individual enemies The stones in their hands were
pathetically brave

The rounded citadel building stone built loopholed for rifles loomed
before them He swung open the door and hurried inside

Hello honey a strange voice said pseudopleasantly Hey youre
kind of cute

Alans eyes went from the two figures before him automatic rifles
cuddled under their arms to the two Wolf clan sentries collapsed in
their own blood on the floor They had paid for lack of vigilance with
their lives

He could see that the strangers were of different clans by their kilts
one a Horse the other a Crow This would mean two clans had united in
order to raid the Wolves and that in turn would mean the Wolves were
outnumbered as much as two to one

Relax darling the second one said a lewd quality in her voice
Nothings going to happen to you Her eyes took in the dozen boys
ranging in age from five to twelve Look like a bunch of sterilies to
me she sneered Get them up above and those girls too You stay
here where we can watch you honey

The Crow went to a small window stared down below Wanda is holding
them pretty well but theyre beginning to work their way back in this
direction She laughed harshly These Wolves never could fight

Her companion fingered the Bren gun which lay on the heavy table top in
the round rooms center Aside from four equally heavily constructed
chairs the table was the large rooms sole furniture While Alan was
ushering the boys and younger girls up to the second floor where they
would be safe the Horse said musingly We could turn this loose on
them even at this distance

The Crow shook her head No Itll be better to wait until theyre
closer Besides by that time Peggy and her groupll be coming up from
the arroyo There wont be a Wolf left half an hour from now

Alan his stomach empty stared out the loophole nearest him

One of the women said grinning You better get away from there
honey Make you sick Thats a mighty pretty suit youve got on Make
it yourself

No Alan said As a matter of fact one of the sterilies had made it

She laughed Well dont be so uppity Youre going to have to learn
how to be nice to me you know

Both of them laughed but Alan said nothing He wondered how long the
women of these clans had been without a husband

Down below he could make out the progress of the fighting and then
realized the battle plan of the aggressors They must have planned it
for months waiting until the season was such that practically the
whole Wolf clan and particularly the fighters would be at work in the
fields Theyd sent these two scouts probably their best warriors to
take the citadel by stealth Only two of them more would have been
conspicuous

They had then with a limited force opened fire on the field workers
pinning them down temporarily

Meanwhile the main body was ascending the arroyo to the left
completely hidden from the defending forces although they would have
been in open sight from above had the citadel remained uncaptured

Alan could see plainly what the next fifteen minutes would mean The
Wolf clan would draw back on the citadel Vivian and her younger
warriors bringing up the rear When they broke into the clear and
started the last dash for the safety of their fortress they would be
in the open and at the mercy of the crossfire from arroyo and citadel

If only these two had failed in their attempt to

The Crow woman said Look at this Five young brats with stones in
their hands What do you say

It was Helen and her four girls

Alan said Theyre only children You cant

You be quiet sweetheart We cant be bothered with you

The Horse said Two years from now theyll all be warriors Here let
me turn this on them

Alan closed his eyes and he wanted to retch as he heard the automatic
rifle speak out in five short bursts In spite of himself he opened
them again Helen his first born Paula his second Ruth Margo and
Jenny all his children They were crumbled like rag dolls fifty feet
from the citadel door

Now he was able to tell himself that he should have called out a
warning One or two of them at least might have escaped Might have
escaped to warn the approaching fighters of the trap behind them
Tradition had been too strong within him the tradition that a man did
not interfere in the business of the warriors that war was a thing
apart

Jennys body moved stirred again and she tried to drag herself away
Little Jenny twelve years old The rifle spat just once again and she
slumped forward and remained quiet

Little bitch the Crow woman said

The heavy chair was in his hands and high above his head he had
brought it down on her before the rage of his hate had allowed him to
think of what he was doing The chair splintered but there was still
a good half of it in his hands when he spun on the Horse woman She
stepped back her eyes wide in disbelief As her companion went down
the side of her face and her scalp welling blood the Horse at first
brought up her rifle and then in despair tried to reverse it to use
its butt as a club

She was stumbling backward trying to get out of the way of his
improvised weapon when her heel caught on the body of one of the
fallen Wolf sentries She tried to catch herself her eyes still
staring horrified disbelief even as he caught her over the head and
then once again He beat her beat her hysterically until he knew she
must be dead

He worked now in a mental vacuum all but unconsciously He ran to the
stair bottom and called Come down his voice was shrill Alice
Tommy all of you

                                   

They came hesitantly and when they saw the shambles of the room
stared at him with as much disbelief as had the enemy women He
pointed a finger at the oldest of the girls Alice he said youve
been given instruction by the warriors How is the Bren gun fired

The eleven year old bug eyed at him But youre a husband Alan

How is it fired he shrilled Unless you tell me there will be no
Wolf clan left

He lugged the heavy gun to the window mounted it there as he had seen
the women do in practice

Tommy he said to a thirteen year old boy Quick get me a pan of
ammunition

I cant Tommy all but wailed

Get it

I cant Its  its unmanly Tommy melted into a sea of tears
utterly confused

Maureen Alan snapped cooler now Get me a pan of ammunition for
the Bren gun Quickly Alice show me how the gun is charged

Alice was at his side trying to explain He would have let her take
over had she been larger but he knew she couldnt handle the bucking
of the weapon Maureen had returned with the ammunition slipped
it expertly into place She too had had instructions in the guns
operation

Alan ran his eyes down the arroyo There were possibly forty of them
Horses and Crowswell armed he could see Less than a quarter of them
had the new muzzle loaders being resorted to by many as ammunition
stocks for the old arms became increasingly rare The others had
ancient arms rifles both military and sport one or two tommy guns

He waited another three or four minutes one eye cocked on the progress
of the running battle below Vivian the scout chief had dropped
back to take over command of the younger warriors She was probably
beginning to smell a rat The intensity of fire wasnt such as to
suggest a large body of enemy

The women in the arroyo were placed now as he wanted them He forced
himself to keep his eyes open as he pressed the trigger

Blat blat blat

The gun spoke kicking high the dust and gravel before the Horse and
Crow warriors advancing up the arroyo

They stopped startled The citadel was supposedly in their hands

They reversed themselves and scurried back to get out of their exposed
position

He touched the trigger again Blat blat blat The heavy slugs tore
up the arroyo wall behind them they could retreat no further without
running into his fire

They stopped confused

Alan said Maureen get another pan of ammunition Ill have to hold
them there until Vivian comes up Alice run down to the matriarch and
tell her about the warriors in the arroyo Quickly now

Little Alice said sourly A husband shouldnt interfere in warrior
affairs but she went

                                   

When Vivian strode into the citadel she had her sniper rifle slung
over her back and was admiring a tommy gun she had taken from one of
the captured Horses Perfect she said stroking the stock Perfect
shape And they seem to have worlds of ammunition too Must have made
some kind of deal with the Denver clans

Her eyes swept the room and her mouth turned down in sour amusement
The Horse woman was dead and the Crow had by now been marched off to
take her place with the other prisoners who were being held in the
stone corral

What warriors she said contemptuously A man overcomes two of
them Two of them mind you She looked at Alan the reaction was
upon him now and he was white faced and couldnt keep his hands from
trembling What a cutie you turned out to be Who ever heard of such a
thing

Alan said defensively They didnt expect it I took them unawares

Vivian laughed aloud her even white teeth sparkling in the redness of
her lips She was tall shapely a twentyfive year old goddess in her
Wolf clan kilts Ill bet you did sweetie

One of the other warriors entered from behind Vivian looked at the
dead Horse woman and shuddered What a way to die not even able to
defend yourself She said to Vivian worriedly Theyve got an awful
lot of equipment chief

Vivian said Well whatre you worrying about Jean We have it now

The girl said They have three tommy guns four automatic rifles
twenty grenades and forty sticks of dynamite

Vivian was impatient They had them now theyre ours Its good not
bad

Jean said doggedly These raids are coming more and more often Weve
lost ten fighters in less than a year And each time they come at us
theyre better equipped and therere more of them She looked over at
Alan If it hadnt been for this  this queer way things worked out
theyd have our husband now and wed be done for

Well it didnt happen that way Vivian said abruptly and we still
have our husband and were going to keep him This wasnt a bad action
at all They killed three of us weve got more than forty of them

Not three eight Jean said You forget the five girls In another
couple of years theyd have been warriors And besides what difference
does it make if weve got forty of them Therere always more of them
where they came from There must be a thousand women toward Denver
without a husband between them

Vivian quieted Lets hope they dont all decide on Alan at once she
said I wonder if the Turtles are having the same trouble

Theyre having more Alan said He had lowered himself wearily into
one of the chairs

The two warriors looked at him How do you know sweetie Vivian
asked him

I was talking to Warren a few weeks ago Hes husband of the Turtle
clan now they traded him from the Foxes Both clans were getting too
interbred

Get to the point honey Jean said embarrassed at this man talk

The Turtles are having more trouble than we are They have a stronger
natural fortress at the center of their farm lands but theyve had so
many raids that their arsenal is depleted and half their warriors dead
or wounded Theyre getting desperate

Thats too bad Vivian muttered They make good neighbors

Jean said The matriarch told me to let you know thered be a meeting
this afternoon in the assembly hall Clan meeting all present

What about Vivian said her attention going back to the beauty of
her captured weapon again

About the prisoners Weve got to decide what to do with them

Do with them Well push them over the side of the canyon Nobody
thought wed waste bullets on them did they

Alan said mildly The question has come up whether we ought to
destroy them at all

Vivian looked at him in gentle annoyance Sweetie she said dont
bother your handsome head with these things Youve had enough
excitement to last a nice looking fellow like you a lifetime

Jean said echoing her chiefs disgust Anyway thats what the
meeting is about Alan here has been talking to the matriarch and
shes agreed to bring it up for discussion

Vivian said nastily Sally is beginning to lose her grip If theres
anything a clan needs its a strong matriarch

A wise matriarch Alan amended knowing he shouldnt

Vivian stared at him for a moment then threw her head back and
laughed Im going to have to spank your bottom one of these days
she told him You get awfully sassy for a man

                                   

As chairman Alan had a voice but not a vote in the meetings of the
Wolf clan He sometimes wondered at the institution which had come
down from prebomb days Why was it necessary to have a chairman
Of course mythlegend had it that men were once just as numerous and
active in societys economic and even martial life as were women
But that was mythlegend It all had a basis in reality perhaps but
some of it was undoubtedly stretched all but to the breaking point

Of course if all men had been fertile in the old days But if you
started with if as a beginning point you could go as far as you
wished in any direction

He called the meeting to order in the assembly hall which stood
possibly a hundred feet below the citadel in one direction another
hundred from the stone corral which housed their prisoners in the
other The Wolf clan was present in its entirety with the exception
of children under ten and except for four scouts who were holding the
prisoners As chairman Alan sat on the dais flanked by Sally the
matriarch  years of age tall Junoesque on one side and by Vivian
the scout chief on the other

Before them sat first the active warriorworkers some thirtyfive
of them Second the older women less than a score Further back
were the sterilies possibly twenty of these and quite young only
within recent memory had they been allowed to become part of the clan
in the past they had been driven away or killed Further back still
were the children above ten but too young to join the ranks of either
warriorworkers or sterilies

Alan called the meeting to order quieted them somewhat and then
invited the matriarch to take the floor

Sally stood and looked out over her clan the dignity of her presence
silencing them where Alans plea had not

She said We have two matters to bring to our attention First I
believe the clan should make it clear to Alan our husband that such
interference in the affairs of women is utterly out of the question I
am speaking of his unmanly activities in the raid this morning

There were mumblings of approval throughout the hall

Alan came to his feet his face bewildered But Sally what else
could I do If I hadnt overcome the enemy warriors and turned the Bren
gun on the others you would all be gone now Possibly none of you would
have survived

Sally quieted him with a chill look Let me repeat what is well known
to every member of the clan We consist of less than sixty women a few
more than thirtyfive of whom are active There are twenty sterilies
and twentyfive or so children And one husband A few more than one
hundred in all

Her voice slowed and lowered for the sake of emphasis All of our
womenexcept for two or threemight die and the clan would live on
The sterilies certainly might all die and the clan live on Even the
children could all die and the clan live on But if our husband dies
the clan dies The greatest responsibility of every member of any
clan is to protect the husband Under no circumstances is he to be
endangered You know this it should not have to be brought to your
attention

There was a strong murmur of assent from those seated before them

Alan said But Sally I saved your lives And if I hadnt I would
have been captured by the Crows and Horses and you would have lost me
at any rate

This was hard for Sally Wolf but she said Then at least they
would have had you If you had died in your foolhardiness you would
have been gone for all of us Alan two clans husbandless clans
united in this attempt to capture you from us While we fought to
protect our husband the life of our clan we hold no rancor against
them In their position we would have done the same Much rather
would we see you taken by them than to see you dead Even though the
Wolf clan might die the race must go on She added but not very
believably If they had captured you perhaps we could have in our
turn captured a husband from some other clan

The reason we probably couldnt Vivian said mildly is that since
weve turned to agriculture and settled our numbers have dropped off
by half We had more than sixty warriors while we were hunterforagers

Thats enough Vivian Sally snapped The question isnt being
discussed this afternoon

Ought to be somebody whispered down in front

Order Alan said He knew it was a growing belief in the clan that
giving up the nomadic life had been a mistake From raiders they had
become the raided

Sally said The second order of business is the disposal of the Horse
and Crow prisoners captured in the action today

Vivian said We cant afford to waste valuable ammunition I say shove
them into the canyon

Most of those seated in the hall approved of that Some were puzzled
of face wondering why the matter hadnt been left simply in the scout
chiefs hands

Sally said dryly I havent formed an opinion myself However our
chairman has some words to say

Vivian looked at Alan as though he was a precocious child She shook
her head You cutie you Youre getting bigger and bigger for your
britches every day

Two or three of the warriors echoed her by chuckling fondly

Alan said nothing to that needing to maintain what dignity and
prestige he could muster

He stood and faced them and waited for their silence before saying
You feminine members of the clan are too busy with work and with
defense to pursue some of the studies for which we men find time

Vivian murmured You aint just a whistlin honey But we dont mind
You do what you want with your time honey

He tried to smile politely but went on It has come to the point
where few women read to any extent and most learning has fallen into
the hands of the menfew as we are

Sally said impatiently What has this got to do with the prisoners
Alan dear

It would seem that he had ignored her when he said I have been
discussing the matter with Warren of the Turtle clan and two or three
other men with whom I occasionally come in contact At the rate
the race is going there will be no men left at all in another few
generations

There was quiet in the long hall Deathly quiet

Sally said How  how do you mean dear

I mean our present system cant go on It isnt working

Of course its working Vivian snapped Here we are arent we Its
always worked it always will Heres the clan Youre our husband
After weve had you for twenty years well trade you to another clan
for their husbandprevents interbreeding If you have a fertile son
the clan will either split each half taking one husband or well
trade him off for land or guns or whatever else is valuable Of
course it works

He shook his head stubbornly Things are changing For a generation
or two after bomb day we were in chaos By time things cleared we
were divided as we are now in clans However we were still largely
able to exist on the canned goods the animals left over from the old
days There was food and guns for all and only a few of the men were
sterilies

Vivian began to say something again but he shook a hand negatively at
her pleading for silence No Im not talking about mythlegend now
Warrens greatgrandfather whom he knew as a boy remembers when there
were four times or more the number of men we have today and when the
sterilies were very few

Vivian said impatiently Whats this got to do with the prisoners
There they are We can kill them or let them go If we let them go
theyll be coming back six months from now to take another crack at
us Alan is cute as a button but I dont think he should meddle in
womens affairs

But most of them were silent They looked up at him waiting for him to
go on

I suppose Sally said that youre coming to a point dear

He nodded his face tight Im coming to the point The point is that
weve got to change the basis of clan society This isnt working any
moreif it ever did Theres such a thing as planned breeding  it
had been hard to say this and the younger women in the audience in
particular tittered  and were going to have to think in terms of
it

Sally had flushed She said now A certain dignity is expected at a
clan meeting Alan dear But just what did you mean

Vivian said This is nonsense Im leaving and she was up from the
speakers table and away Two or three of her younger girls looked
after scowling but they didnt follow her out of the hall

I mean Alan said doggedly that one of those Crow women has been
the mother of two fertile men To my knowledge she is the only woman
within hundreds of miles this can be said about We men have been
keeping records of such things

Sally was as mystified as the rest of the clan

Alan said I say bring these women into the clan Unite with the
Turtles and the Burros so that well have three clans five counting
the Horses and Crows Then well have enough strength to fight off the
foragerhunters and well have enough men to experiment in selective
breeding

Half of the hall was on its feet in a roar

Share you with these  these desert rats who just raided us who
killed eight of our clan Sally snapped flabbergasted

He stood his ground Yes Ill repeat one of those Crow women has
borne two fertile men children We cant afford to kill her For all we
know she might have a dozen more This haphazard method of a single
husband for a whole clan must be replaced

The hall broke down into chaos again

Sally held up a commanding hand for silence She said And if we share
you with another forty or fifty women to what extent will the rest of
us have any husband at all

He pointed out the sterilies seated silently in the back It would
be healthier if you gave up some of this superior contempt you hold
for sterile males and accept their companionship Although they cannot
be fathers they can be mates otherwise As it is how much true
companionship do you secure from meany of you Less than once a month
do you see me more than from a distance

Mate with sterilies someone gasped from the front row

Yes Alan snapped back And let fertile men be used expressly for
attempting to produce additional fertile men Confound it cant you
warriors realize what Im saying I have reports that there is a woman
among the Crows who has borne two fertile male children Have you ever
heard of any such phenomenon before Do you realize that in the fifteen
years I have been the husband of this clan we have not had even one
fertile man child born Do you realize that in the past twenty years
there has been born not one fertile man child in the Turtle clan Only
one in the Burro clan

He had them in the palm of his hand now

Whatwhat does the Turtle clan think of this plan of yours Sally
said

I was talking to Warren just the other day He thinks he can win their
approval We can also probably talk the Burros into it Theyre growing
desperate Their husband is nearly sixty years old and has produced
only one fertile male child which was later captured in a raid by the
Denver foragers

Sally said And wed have to share you with all these and with our
prisoners as well

Yes in an attempt to breed fertile men back into the race

Sally turned to the assembled clan

A heavy explosion roomshaking in its violence all but threw them
to the floor Half a dozen of the younger warriors scurried to the
windows guns at the ready

In the distance from the outside there was the chatter of a machine
gun then individual pistol shots

The corral Jean the scout said her lips going back over her teeth

Vivian came sauntering back into the assembly hall patting the stock
of her new tommy gun appreciately Works like a charm she said
That dynamite we captured was fresh too Blew em to smithereens Only
had to finish off half a dozen

Alan said agonizingly Vivian You didnt  the prisoners

She grinned at him Alan youre as cute as a button but you dont
know anything about womens affairs Now you be a honey and go back to
taking care of the children

Gutenbergtm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone For forty years he produced and

volunteer support

Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the US unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition

facility wwwgutenbergorg

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to
