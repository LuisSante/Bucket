Sidenote Youre all alone in a deserted city You walk down an empty
street yearning for the sight of one living faceone moving figure
Then you see a man on a corner and you know your terror has only
begun


He awoke slowly like a man plodding kneedeep through the thick stuff
of nightmares There was no definite line between the dreamstate and
wakefulness Only a dawning knowledge that he was finally conscious and
would have to do something about it

He opened his eyes but this made no difference The blackness remained
The pain in his head brightened and he reached up and found the big lump
theyd evidently put on his head for good measurea margin of safety

They must have been prudent people because the bang on the head had
hardly been necessary The spiked drink which they had given him would
have felled an ox He remembered going down into the darkness after
drinking it and of knowing what it was He remembered the helpless
feeling

It did not worry him now He was a philosophical person and the fact he
was still alive cancelled out the drink and its result He thought with
savor of the chestnuthaired girl who had watched him take the drink
She had worn a very low bodice and that was where his eyes had been at
the last momenton the beautiful tanned breastsuntil theyd wavered
and puddled into a blur and then into nothing

The chestnuthaired girl had been nice but now she was gone and there
were more pressing problems

He sat up his hands behind him at the ends of stiff arms clawing into
longundisturbed dust and filth His movement stirred the dust and it
rose into his nostrils

He straightened and banged his head against a low ceiling The pain made
him sick for a minute and he sat down to regain his senses He cursed
the ceiling as a matter of course in an agonized whisper

Ready to move again he got onto his hands and knees and crawled
cautiously forward exploring as he went His hand pushed through
cobwebs and found a rough cement wall He went around and around It
was all cementall solid

Hell They hadnt sealed him up in this place There had been a way in
so there had to be a way out He went around again

Then he tried the ceiling and found the openinga wooden trap covering
a fourbyfour holecovering it snugly He pushed the trap away and
daylight streamed in He raised himself up until he was eyelevel with a
discarded shaving cream jar lying on the bricks of an alley He could
read the trade mark on the jar and the slogan For the Meticulous
Man

He pulled himself up into the alley As a result of an orderly
childhood he replaced the wooden trap and kicked the shaving cream jar
against a garbage can He rubbed his chin and looked up and down the
alley

It was high noon An uncovered sun blazed down to tell him this

And there was no one in sight

                                   

He started walking toward the nearer mouth of the alley He had been in
that hole a long time he decided This conviction came from his hunger
and the heavy growth of beard hed sprouted Twentyfour hoursmaybe
longer That mickey must have been a lulu

He walked out into the cross street It was empty No peopleno cars
parked at the curbsonly a cat washing its dirty face on a tenement
stoop across the street He looked up at the tenement windows They
stared back There was an empty deserted look about them

The cat flowed down the front steps of the tenement and away toward the
rear and he was truly alone He rubbed his harsh chin Must be Sunday
he thought Then he knew it could not be Sunday Hed gone into the
tavern on a Tuesday night That would make it five days Too long

He had been walking and now he was at an intersection where he could
look up and down a new street There were no carsno people Not even a
cat

A sign overhanging the sidewalk said Restaurant He went in under the
sign and tried the door It was locked There were no lights inside He
turned awaygrinning to reassure himself Everything was all right
Just some kind of a holiday In a big city like Chicago the people go
away on hot summer holidays They go to the beaches and the parks and
sometimes you cant see a living soul on the streets And of course you
cant find any cars because the people use them to drive to the beaches
and the parks and out into the country He breathed a little easier and
started walking again

Surethat was it Now what the hell holiday was it He tried to
remember He couldnt think of what holiday it could be Maybe theyd
dreamed up a new one He grinned at that but the grin was a little
tight and he had to force it He forced it carefully until his teeth
showed white

Pretty soon he would come to a section where everybody hadnt gone to
the beaches and the parks and a restaurant would be open and hed get a
good meal

A meal He fumbled toward his pockets He dug into them and found a
handkerchief and a button from his cuff He remembered that the button
had hung loose so hed pulled it off to keep from losing it He hadnt
lost the button but everything else was gone He scowled The least
they could have done was to leave a man eating money

He turned another cornerinto another streetand it was like the one
before No carsno peoplenot even any cats

Panic welled up He stopped and whirled around to look behind him No
one was there He walked in a tight circle looking in all directions
Windows stared back at himeyes that didnt care where everybody had
gone or when they would come back The windows could wait The windows
were not hungry Their heads didnt ache They werent scared

He began walking and his path veered outward from the sidewalk until he
was in the exact center of the silent street He walked down the worn
white line When he got to the next corner he noticed that the traffic
signals were not working Black empty eyes

His pace quickened He walked fasterever faster until he was trotting
on the brittle pavement his sharp steps echoing against the buildings
Faster Another corner And he was running filled with panic down the
empty street

                                   

The girl opened her eyes and stared at the ceiling The ceiling was a
blur but it began to clear as her mind cleared The ceiling became a
surface of dirty cracked plaster and there was a feeling of dirt and
squalor in her mind

It was always like that at these times of awakening but doubly bitter
now because she had never expected to awaken again She reached down
and pulled the wadded sheet from beneath her legs and spread it over
them She looked at the bottle on the shabby bedtable There were three
sleeping pills left in it The girls eyes clouded with resentment
Youd think seven pills would have done it She reached down and took
the sheet in both hands and drew it taut over her stomach This was a
gesture of frustration Seven hadnt been enough and here she was
againawake in the world shed wanted to leave Awake with the
necessary edge of determination gone

She pulled the sheet into a wad and threw it at the wall She got up and
walked to the window and looked out Bright daylight She wondered how
long she had slept A long time no doubt

Her naked thigh pressed against the windowsill and her bare stomach
touched the dirty pane Naked in the window but it didnt matter
because it gave onto an airshaft and other windows so caked with grime
as to be of no value as windows

But even aside from that it didnt matter It didnt matter in the
least

She went to the washstand her bare feet making no sound on the worn
rug She turned on the faucets but no water came No water and she had
a terrible thirst She went to the door and had thrown the bolt before
she remembered again that she was naked She turned back and saw the
halfempty PepsiCola bottle on the floor beside the bed table Someone
else had left it therehow many nights agobut she drank it anyhow
and even though it was flat and warm it soothed her throat

She bent over to pick up garments from the floor and dizziness came
forcing her to the edge of the bed After a while it passed and she got
her legs into one of the garments and pulled it on

Taking cosmetics from her bag she went again to the washstand and tried
the taps Still no water She combed her hair jerking the comb through
the mats and gnarls with a satisfying viciousness When the hair fell
into its natural blond curls she applied powder and lipstick She
went back to the bed picked up her brassiere and began putting it on as
she walked to the cracked fulllength mirror in the closet door With
the brassiere in place she stood looking at her slim image She assayed
herself with complete impersonality

She shouldnt look as good as she didnot after the beating shed
taken Not after the long nights and the days and the years even though
the years did not add up to very many

I could be someones wife she thought with wry humor I could be
sending kids to school and going out to argue with the grocer about the
tomatoes being too soft I dont look bad at all

She raised her eyes until they were staring into their own images in the
glass and she spoke aloud in a low wondering voice She said Who the
hell am I anyway Who am I A body named Lindathats who I am
Nothats what I am A bodys not a whoits a what One hundred
and fourteen pounds of wellbuilt blond body called Lindamodel
no fender dentsnice paint job Come in and drive me away Price
tag

She bit into the lower lip shed just finished reddening and turned
quickly to walk to the bed and wriggle into her dressa gray and green
cottonthe only one she had She picked up her bag and went to the
door There she stopped to turn and thumb her nose at the three sleeping
pills in the bottle before she went out and closed the door after
herself

The desk clerk was away from the cubbyhole from which he presided over
the lobby and there were no loungers to undress her as she walked
toward the door

Nor was there anyone out in the street The girl looked north and south
No cars in sight either No buses waddling up to the curb to spew out
passengers

The girl went five doors north and tried to enter a place called Tims
Hamburger House As the lock held and the door refused to open she saw
that there were no lights on insideno one behind the counter The
place was closed

She walked on down the street followed only by the lonesome sound of her
own clicking heels All the stores were closed All the lights were out

All the people were gone

                                   

He was a huge man and the place of concealment of the Chicago Avenue
police station was very smallmerely an indentation low in the cement
wall behind two steam pipes The big man had lain in this niche for
fortyeight hours He had slugged a man over the turn of a card in a
poolroom pinochle game had been arrested in due course and was
awaiting the disposal of his case

He was sorry he had slugged the man He had not had any deep hatred for
him but rather a rage of the moment that demanded violence as its
outlet Although he did not consider it a matter of any great
importance he did not look forward to the six months jail sentence he
would doubtless be given

His opportunity to hide in the niche had come as accidentally and as
suddenly as his opportunity to slug his card partner It had come after
the prisoners had been advised of the crisis and were being herded into
vans for transportation elsewhere He had snatched the opportunity
without giving any consideration whatever to the crisis Probably
because he did not have enough imagination to fear anythinghowever
terriblewhich might occur in the future And because he treasured his
freedom above all else Freedom for today tomorrow could take care of
itself

Now after fortyeight hours he writhed and twisted his huge body out
of the niche and onto the floor of the furnace room His legs were numb
and he found that he could not stand He managed to sit up and was able
to bend his back enough so his great hands could reach his legs and
begin to massage life back into them

So elementally brutal was this man that he pounded his legs until they
were black and blue before feeling returned to them In a few minutes
he was walking out of the furnace room through a jail house which should
now be utterly deserted But was it He went slowly gliding along close
to the walls to reach the front door unchallenged

He walked out into the street It was daylight and the street was
completely deserted The man took a deep breath and grinned Ill be
damned he muttered Ill be double and triple damned Theyre all
gone Every damn one of them run off like rats and Im the only one
left Ill be damned

A tremendous sense of exultation seized him He clenched his fists and
laughed loud his laugh echoing up the street He was happier than he
had ever been in his quick violent life And his joy was that of a
child locked in a pantry with a huge chocolate cake

He rubbed a hand across his mouth looked up the street began walking
I wonder if they took all the whisky with them he said Then he
grinned he was sure they had not

He began walking in long strides toward Clark Street In toward the
still heart of the empty city

                                   

He was a slim paleskinned little man and very dangerous He was also
very clever Eventually they would have found out but he had been
clever enough to deceive them and now they would never know There was
great wealth in his family and with the rest of them occupied with
leaving the city and taking what valuables they could on such short
notice he had been put in charge of one of the chauffeurs

The chauffeur had been given the responsibility of getting the
paleskinned young man out of the city But the young man had caused
several delays until all the rest were gone Then meekly enough he had
accompanied the chauffeur to the garage The chauffeur got behind the
wheel of the last remaining cara Cadillac sedanand the young man had
gotten into the rear seat

But before the chauffeur could start the motor the young man hit him on
the head with a tire bar he had taken from a shelf as they had entered
the garage

The bar went deep into the chauffeurs skull with a solid sound and
thus the chauffeur found the death he was in the very act of fleeing

The young man pulled the dead chauffeur from the car and laid him on the
cement floor He laid him down very carefully so that he was in the
exact center of a large square of outlined cement with his feet pointing
straight north and his outstretched arms pointing south

The young man placed the chauffeurs cap very carefully upon his chest
because neatness pleased him Then he got into the car started it and
headed east toward Lake Michigan and the downtown section

After traveling three or four miles he turned the car off the road and
drove it into a telephone post Then he walked until he came to some
high weeds He lay down in the weeds and waited

He knew there would probably be a last vanguard of militia hunting for
stragglers If they saw a moving car they would investigate They would
take him into custody and force him to leave the city

This he felt they had no right to do All his life he had been ordered
abouttold to do this and that and the other thing Stupid orders from
stupid people Idiots who went so far as to claim the whole city would
be destroyed just to make people do as they said God The ends to
which stupid people would go in order to assert their wills over
brilliant people

The young man lay in the weeds and dozed off his mind occupied with the
pleasant memory of the tire iron settling into the skull of the
chauffeur

After a while he awoke and heard the cars of the last vanguard passing
down the road They stopped inspected the Cadillac and found it
serviceable They took it with them but they did not search the weeds
along the road

When they had disappeared toward the west the young man came back to
the road and began walking east in toward the city

Complete destruction in two days

Preposterous

The young man smiled

                                   

The girl was afraid For hours she had walked the streets of the empty
city and the fear strengthened by weariness was now mounting toward
terror One face she whispered Just one person coming out of a
house or walking across the street Thats all I ask Somebody to tell
me what this is all about If I can find one person I wont be afraid
any more

And the irony of it struck her A few hours previously she had attempted
suicide Sick of herself and of all people she had tried to end her own
life Therefore by acknowledging death as the answer she should now
have no fear whatever of anything Reconciled to crossing the bridge
into death no facet of life should have held terror for her

But the empty city did hold terror One faceone moving form was all
she asked for

Then a second irony When she saw the man at the corner of Washington
and Wells her terror increased They saw each other at almost the same
moment Both stopped and stared Fingers of panic ran up the girls
spine The man raised a hand and the spell was broken The girl turned
and ran and there was more terror in her than there had been before

Illustration

She knew how absurd this was but still she ran blindly What had she to
fear She knew all about men all the things men could do they had
already done to her Murder was the ultimate but she was fresh from a
suicide attempt Death should hold no terrors for her

She thought of these things as the mans footsteps sounded behind her
and she turned into a narrow alley seeking a hiding place She found
none and the man turned in after her

She found a passageway entered with the same blindness which had
brought her into the alley There was a steel door at the end and a
brick lying by the sill The door was locked She picked up the brick
and turned The man skidded on the filthy alley surface as he turned
into the areaway

The girl raised the brick over her head Keep away Stay away from me

Wait a minute Take it easy Im not going to hurt you

Get away

Her arm moved downward The man rushed in and caught her wrist The
brick went over his shoulder and the nails of her other hand raked his
face He seized her without regard for niceties and they went to the
ground She fought with everything she had and he methodically
neutralized all her weaponsher hands her legs her teethuntil she
could not move

Leave me alone Please

Whats wrong with you Im not going to hurt you But Im not going to
let you hit me with a brick either

What do you want Why did you chase me

LookIm a peaceful guy but Im not going to let you get away I
spent all afternoon looking for somebody I found you and you ran away
I came after you

I havent done anything to you

Thats silly talk Come ongrow up I said Im not going to hurt you

Let me up

So you can run away again Not for a while I want to talk to you

II wont run I was scared I dont know why Youre hurting me

He got upgingerlyand lifted her to her feet He smiled still
holding both her hands Im sorry I guess its natural for you to be
scared My names Frank Brooks I just want to find out what the hell
happened to this town

He let her withdraw her hands but he still blocked her escape She
moved a pace backward and straightened her clothing I dont know what
happened I was looking for someone too

He smiled again And then you ran

I dont know why I guess

Whats your name

NoraNora Spade

You slept through it too

Yes  yes I slept through it and came out and they were all gone

Lets get out of this alley He preceded her out but he waited for
her when there was room for them to walk side by side and she did not
try to run away That phase was evidently over

I got slipped a mickey in a tavern Frank Brooks said Then they
slugged me and put me in a hole

His eyes questioned She felt their demand and said I wasasleep in
my hotel room

They overlooked you

I guess so

Then you dont know anything about it

Nothing Something terrible must have happened

Lets go down this way Frank said and they moved toward Madison
Street He had taken her arm and she did not pull away Rather she
walked invitingly close to him

She said Its so spooky So  empty I guess thats what scared me

It would scare anybody There must have been an evacuation of some
kind

Maybe the Russians are going to drop a bomb

Frank shook his head That wouldnt explain it I mean the Russians
wouldnt let us know ahead of time Besides the army would be here
Everybody wouldnt be gone

Theres been a lot of talk about germ warfare Do you suppose the
water maybe has been poisoned

He shook his head The same thing holds true Even if they moved the
people out the army would be here

I dont know It just doesnt make sense

It happened so it has to make sense It was something that came up all
of a sudden They didnt have much more than twentyfour hours He
stopped suddenly and looked at her Weve got to get out of here

Nora Spade smiled for the first time but without humor How I havent
seen one car The buses arent running

His mind was elsewhere They had started walking again Funny I didnt
think of that before

Think of what

That anybody left in this town is a dead pigeon The only reason theyd
clear out a city would be to get away from certain death That would
mean death is here for anybody that stays Funny I was so busy looking
for somebody to talk to that I never thought of that

I did

Is that what you were scared of

Not particularly Im not afraid to die It was something else that
scared me The aloneness I guess

Wed better start walking westout of the city Maybe well find a car
or something

I dont think well find any cars

He drew her to a halt and looked into her face You arent afraid at
all are you

She thought for a moment No I guess Im not Not of dying that is
Dying is a normal thing But I was afraid of the empty streetsnobody
around That was weird

It isnt weird now

Notnot as much

I wonder how much time weve got

Nora shrugged I dont know but Im hungry

We can fix that I broke into a restaurant a few blocks back and got
myself a sandwich I think theres still food around They couldnt take
it all with them

They were on Madison Street and they turned east on the south side of
the street Nora said I wonder if there are any other people still
herelike us

I think there must be Not very many but a few They would have had to
clean four million people out overnight It stands to reason they must
have missed a few Did you ever try to empty a sack of sugar Really
empty it Its impossible Some of the grains always stick to the sack

A few minutes later the wisdom of this observation was proven when they
came to a restaurant with the front window broken out and saw a man and
a woman sitting at one of the tables

                                   

He was a huge man with a shock of black hair and a mouth slightly open
showing a set of incredibly white teeth He waved an arm and shouted
Come on in Come on in for crissake and sit down We got beer and roast
beef and the beers still cold Come on in and meet Minna

This was different Nora thought Not eerie Not weird like seeing a
man standing on a deserted street corner with no one else around This
seemed normal natural and even the smashed window didnt detract too
much from the naturalness

They went inside There were chairs at the table and they sat down The
big man did not get up He waved a hand toward his companion and said
This is Minna Aint she something I found her sitting at an empty bar
scared to death We came to an understanding and I brought her along
He grinned at the woman and winked We came to a real understanding
didnt we Minna

Minna was a completely colorless woman of perhaps thirtyfive Her skin
was smooth and pale and she wore no makeup of any kind Her hair was
drawn straight back into a bun The hair had no predominating color It
was somewhere between light brown and blond

She smiled a little sadly but the laugh did not cover her worn tired
look It seemed more like a gesture of obedience than anything else
Yes We came to an understanding

Im Jim Wilson the big man boomed I was in the Chicago Avenue jug
for slugging a guy in a card game They kind of overlooked me when they
cleaned the joint out He winked again I kind of helped them overlook
me Then I found Minna There was tremendous relish in his words

Frank started introductions which Nora Spade cut in on Maybe you know
what happened she asked

Wilson shook his head I was in the jug and they didnt tell us They
just started cleaning out the joint There was talk in the
bullpeninvasion or something Nobody knew for sure Have some beer and
meat

Nora turned to the quiet Minna Did you hear anything

Naw Wilson said with a kind of affectionate contempt She dont know
anything about it She lived in some attic dump and was down with a sore
throat She took some pills or something and when she woke up they were
gone

I went to work and Minna began but Wilson cut her off

She swabs out some joints on Chicago Avenue for a living and that was
how she happened to be sitting in that tavern Its payday and Minna
was waiting for her dough He exploded into laughter and slapped the
table with a huge hand Can you beat that Waiting for her pay at a
time like this

Frank Brooks set down his beer bottle The beer was cold and it tasted
good Have you met anybody else There must be some other people
around

Uhuh Havent met anybody but Minna He turned his eyes on the woman
again then got to his feet Come on Minna You and I got to have a
little conference We got things to talk about Grinning he walked
toward the rear of the restaurant Minna got up more slowly She
followed him behind the counter and into the rear of the place

Alone with Nora Frank said You arent eating Want me to look for
something else

NoIm not very hungry I was just wondering

Wondering about what

When it will happen When whatever is going to happenyou know what I
mean

Id rather know whats going to happen I hate puzzles Its hell to
have to get killed and not know what killed you

We arent being very sensible are we

How do you mean

We should at least act normal

I dont get it

Nora frowned in slight annoyance Normal people would be trying to
reach safety They wouldnt be sitting in a restaurant drinking beer We
should be trying to get away Even if it does mean walking Normal
people would be trying to get away

Frank stared at his bottle for a moment We should be scared stiff
shouldnt we

It was Noras turn to ponder Im not sure Maybe not I know Im not
fighting anything insidefear I mean I just dont seem to care one
way or another

I care Frank replied I care I dont want to die But were faced
with a situation and either way its a gamble We might be dead before
I finish this bottle of beer If thats true why not sit here and be
comfortable Or we might have time to walk far enough to get out of
range of whatever it is that chased everybody

Which way do you think it is

I dont think we have time to get out of town They cleaned it out too
fast Wed need at least four or five hours to get away If we had that
much time the army or whoever did it would still be around

Maybe they didnt know themselves when its going to happen

He made an impatient gesture What difference does it make Were in a
situation we didnt ask to get in Our luck put us here and Im damned
if Im going to kick a hole in the ceiling and yell for help

Nora was going to reply but at that moment Jim Wilson came striding out
front He wore his big grin and he carried another halfdozen bottles of
beer Minnall be out in a minute he said Women are always slower
than hell

He dropped into a chair and snapped the cap off a beer bottle with his
thumb He held the bottle up and squinted through it sighing gustily
Man I aint never had it so good He tilted the bottle in salute and
drank

                                   

The sun was lowering in the west now and when Minna reappeared it
seemed that she materialized from the shadows so quietly did she move
Jim Wilson opened another bottle and put it before her Herehave a
drink baby

Obediently she tilted the bottle and drank

What do you plan to do Frank asked

Itll be dark soon Wilson said We ought to go out and try to
scrounge some flashlights I bet the power plants are dead Probably
arent any flashlights either

Are you going to stay here Nora asked Here in the Loop

He seemed surprised Why not A mand be a fool to walk out on all
this All he wants to eat and drink No goddam cops around The life of
Reilly and I should walk out

Arent you afraid of whats going to happen

I dont give a good goddam whats going to happen What the hell
Somethings always going to happen

They didnt evacuate the city for nothing Frank said

You mean we can all get killed Jim Wilson laughed Sure we can We
could have got killed last week too We could of got batted in the can
by a truck anytime we crossed the street He emptied his bottle threw
it accurately at a mirror over the cash register The crash was
thunderous Trouble with you people youre worry warts he said with
an expansive grin Lets go get us some flashlights so we can find our
way to bed in one of those fancy hotels

He got to his feet and Minna arose also a little tired a little
apprehensive but entirely submissive Jim Wilson said Come on baby
I sure wont want to lose you He grinned at the others You guys
coming

Franks eyes met Noras He shrugged Why not he said Unless you
want to start walking

Im too tired Nora said

As they stepped out through the smashed window both Nora and Frank
halfexpected to see other forms moving up and down Madison Street But
there was no one Only the unreal desolation of the lonely pavement and
the darkwindowed buildings

The biggest ghost town on earth Frank muttered

Noras hand had slipped into Franks He squeezed it and neither of them
seemed conscious of the contact

I wonder Nora said Maybe this is only one of them Maybe all the
other big cities are evacuated too

Jim Wilson and Minna were walking ahead He turned If you two cant
sleep without finding out whats up its plenty easy to do

You think we could find a battery radio in some store Frank asked

Hell no Theyll all be gone But all youd have to do is snoop around
in some newspaper office If you can read you can find out what
happened

It seemed strange to Frank that he had not thought of this Then he
realized he hadnt tried very hard to think of anything at all He was
surprised also at his lack of fear Hes gone through life pretty much
taking things as they cameas big a sucker as the next manmaking more
than his quota of mistakes and blunders Finding himself completely
alone in a deserted city for the first time in his life he had
naturally fallen prey to sudden fright But that had gradually passed
and now he was able to accept the new reality fairly passively He
wondered if that wasnt pretty much the way of all people New
situations brought a surge of whatever emotion fitted the picture Then
the emotion subsided and the new thing became the ordinary

This he decided was the manner in which humanity survived Humanity
took things as they came Pile on enough of anything and it becomes the
ordinary

Jim Wilson had picked up a garbage box and hurled it through the window
of an electric shop The glass came down with a crash that shuddered up
the empty darkening street and grumbled off into silence Jim Wilson
went inside Ill see what I can find You stay out here and watch for
cops His laughter echoed out as he disappeared

Minna stood waiting silently unmoving and somehow she reminded Frank
of a dumb animal an unreasoning creature with no mind of her own
waiting for a signal from her master Strangely he resented this but
at the same time could find no reason for his resentment except the
feeling that no one should appear as much a slave as Minna

Jim Wilson reappeared in the window He motioned to Minna Come on in
baby You and mes got to have a little conference His exaggerated
wink was barely perceptible in the gloom as Minna stepped over the low
sill into the store Wont be long folks Wilson said in high good
humor and the two of them vanished into the darkness beyond

Frank Brooks glanced at Nora but her face was turned away He cursed
softy under his breath He said Wait a minute and went into the
store through the huge jagged opening

Inside he could barely make out the counters The place was larger than
it had appeared from the outside Wilson and Minna were nowhere about

Frank found the counter he was looking for and pawed out several
flashlights They were only empty tubes but he found a case of
batteries in a panel compartment against the wall

Whos there

Me I came in for some flashlights

Couldnt you wait

Its getting dark

You dont have to be so damn impatient Jim Wilsons voice was hostile
and surly

Frank stifled his quick anger Well be outside he said He found
Nora waiting where hed left her He loaded batteries into four
flashlights before Jim Wilson and Minna reappeared

Wilsons good humor was back How about the Morrison or the Sherman
he said Or do you want to get real ritzy and walk up to the Drake

My feet hurt Minna said The woman spoke so rarely Frank Brooks was
startled by her words

Morrisons the closest Jim Wilson said Lets go He took Minna by
the arm and swung off up the street Frank and Nora fell in behind

Nora shivered Frank holding her arm asked Cold

No Its just allunreal again

I see what you mean

I never expected to see the Loop dark I cant get used to it

A vagrant whispering wind picked up a scrap of paper and whirled it
along the street It caught against Noras ankle She jerked perceptibly
and kicked the scrap away The wind caught it again and spiralled it
away into the darkness

I want to tell you something she said

Tell away

I told you before that I slept through thethe evacuation or whatever
it was That wasnt exactly true I did sleep through it but it was my
fault I put myself to sleep

I dont get it

I tried to kill myself Sleeping tablets Seven of them They werent
enough

Frank said nothing while they paced off ten steps through the dark
canyon that was Madison Street Nora wondered if he had heard

I tried to commit suicide

Why

I was tired of life I guess

What do you wantsympathy

The sudden harshness in his voice brought her eyes around but his face
was a white blur

Nono I dont think so

Well you wont get it from me Suicide is silly You can have troubles
and all thateverybody has thembut suicidewhy did you try it

A high thin whinea wordless vibration of eloquenceneedled out of
the darkness into their ears The shock was like a sudden shower of ice
water dashed over their bodies Noras fingers dug into Franks arm but
he did not feel the cutting nails Weretheres someone out there in
the street

                                   

Twentyfive feet ahead of where Frank and Nora stood frozen there burst
the booming voice of Jim Wilson What the hell was that And the shock
was dispelled The white circle from Wilsons flash bit out across the
blackness to outline movement on the far side of the street Then Frank
Brooks light and Noras went exploring

Theres somebody over there Wilson bellowed Hey you Show your
face Quit sneaking around

Franks light swept an arc that clearly outlined the buildings across
the street and then weakened as it swung westward There was something
or someone back there but obscured by the dimness He was swept by a
sense of unreality again

Did you see them

Noras light beam had dropped to her feet as though she feared to point
it out into the darkness I thought I saw something

Jim Wilson was swearing industriously There was a guy over there He
ducked around the corner Some damn fool out scrounging Wish I had a
gun

Frank and Nora moved ahead and the four stood in a group Put out your
lights Wilson said They make good targets if the jerks got any
weapons

They stood in the darkness Nora holding tightly to Franks arm Frank
said That was the damndest noise I ever heard

Like a siren Frank thought Jim Wilson spoke hopefully as though
wanting somebody to agree with him

Not like any I ever heard Not like a whistle either More of a moan

Lets get into that goddam hotel and

Jim Wilsons words were cut off by a new wellingup of the melancholy
howling It had a new pattern this time It sounded from many places
not nearer Frank thought than Lake Street on the north but spreading
outward and backward and growing fainter until it died on the wind

Nora was shivering clinging to Frank without reserve

Jim Wilson said Ill be damned if it doesnt sound like a signal of
some kind

Maybe its a languagea way of communication

But who the hells communicating

How would I know

We best get to that hotel and bar a few doors A man cant fight in the
darkand nothing to fight with

They hurried up the street but it was all different now Gone was the
illusion of being alone gone the sense of solitude Around them the
ghost town had come suddenly alive Sinister forces more frightening
than the previous solitude had now to be reckoned with

Somethings happenedsomething in the last few minutes Nora
whispered

Frank leaned close as they crossed the street to the dark silent pile
that was the Morrison hotel I think I know what you mean

Its as though there was no one around and then suddenly they came

I think they came and went away again

Did you actually see anyone when you flashed your light

NoI cant say positively that I did But I got the impression there
were figures out thereat least dozens of themand that they moved
back away from the light Always just on the edge of it

Im scared Frank

So am I

Do you think it could all be imagination

Those moans Maybe the first oneIve heard of people imagining
sounds But not the last ones And besides we all heard them

Jim Wilson utterly oblivious of any subtle emanations in the air
boomed out in satisfaction We dont have to bust the joint open The
revolving door works

Then maybe we ought to be careful Frank said Maybe somebody else is
around here

Could be Well find out

Why are we afraid Nora whispered

Its natural isnt it Frank melted the beam of his light with that
of Jim Wilson The white finger pierced the darkness inside Nothing
moved

I dont see why it should be If there are people in there they must be
as scared as we are

Nora was very close to him as they entered

The lobby seemed deserted The flashlight beams scanned the empty chairs
and couches The glass of the deserted cages threw back reflections

The keys are in there Frank said He vaulted the desk and scanned the
numbers under the pigeon holes

Wed better stay down low Jim Wilson said Damned if Im going to
climb to the penthouse

How about the fourth floor

Thats plenty high enough

Frank came out with a handful of keys Odd numbers he said Four in
a row

Well Ill be damned Jim Wilson muttered But he said no more and they
climbed the stairs in silence They passed the quiet dining rooms and
banquet halls and by the time they reached the fourth floor the doors
giving off the corridors had assumed a uniformity

Here they are He handed a key to Wilson Thats the end one He
said nothing as he gave Minna her key but Wilson grunted For
crissake in a disgusted voice took Minnas key and threw it on the
floor

Frank and Nora watched as Wilson unlocked his door Wilson turned
Well goodnight all If you get goosed by any spooks just yell

Minna followed him without a word and the door closed

Frank handed Nora her key Lock your door and youll be safe Ill
check the room first He unlocked the door and flashed his light
inside Nora was close behind him as he entered He checked the
bathroom Everything clear Lock your door and youll be safe

Frank

Yes

Im afraid to stay alone

You mean you want me to

There are two beds here

His reply was slow in coming Nora didnt wait for it Her voice rose to
the edge of hysteria Quit being so damned righteous Things have
changed Cant you realize that What does it matter how or where we
sleep Does the world care Will it make a damn bit of difference to the
world whether I strip stark naked in front of you A sob choked in her
throat Or would that outrage your morality

He moved toward her stopped six inches away It isnt that For Gods
sake Im no saint Its just that I thought you

Im plain scared and I dont want to be alone To me thats all thats
important

Her face was against his chest and his arms went around her But her own
hands were fists held together against him until he could feel her
knuckles hard against his chest She was crying

Sure Frank said Ill stay with you Now take it easy Everythings
going to be all right

Nora sniffled without bothering to reach for her handkerchief Stop
lying You know it isnt going to be all right

Frank was at somewhat of a loss This flareup of Noras was entirely
unexpected He eased toward the place the flashlight had shown the bed
to be Her legs hit its edge and she sat down

Youyou want me to sleep in the other one he asked

Of course Nora replied with marked bitterness Im afraid you
wouldnt be very comfortable in with me

There was a time of silence Frank took off his jacket shirt and
trousers It was funny he thought Hed spent his money been drugged
beaten and robbed as a result of one objectiveto get into a room alone
with a girl And a girl not nearly as nice as Nora at that Now here he
was alone with a real dream and he was tonguetied It didnt make
sense He shrugged Life was crazy sometimes

He heard the rustle of garments and wondered how much Nora was taking
off Then he dropped his trousers forgotten to the floor Did you
hear that

Yes Its that

Frank went to the window raised the sash The moaning sound came in
louder but it was from far distance I think thats out around
Evanston

Frank felt a warmth on his cheek and he realized Nora was by his side
leaning forward He put an arm around her and they stood unmoving in
complete silence Although their ears were straining for the sound
coming down from the north Frank could not be oblivious of the warm
flesh under his hand

Noras breathing was soft against his cheek She said Listen to how it
rises and falls Its almost as though they were using it to talk with
The inflection changes

I think thats what it is Its coming from a lot of different places
It stops in some places and starts in others

Its soweird

Spooky Frank said but in a way it makes me feel better

I dont see how it could Nora pressed closer to him

It does though because of what I was afraid of I had it figured out
that the city was going to blow upthat a bomb had been planted that
they couldnt find or something like that Now Im pretty sure its
something else Im willing to bet well be alive in the morning

Nora thought that over in silence If thats the way it isif some
kind of invaders are coming down from the northisnt it stupid to stay
here Even if we are tired we ought to be trying to get away from them

I was thinking the same thing Ill go and talk to Wilson

They crossed the room together and he left her by the bed and went on to
the door Then he remembered he was in his shorts and went back and got
his trousers After hed put them on he wondered why hed bothered He
opened the door

Something warned himsome instinctor possibly his natural fear and
caution coincided with the presence of danger He heard the footsteps on
the carpeting down the hallsoft but unmistakably footsteps He
called WilsonWilsonthat you

The creature outside threw caution to the winds Frank sensed rather
than heard a body hurtling toward the door A shrill mad laughter raked
his ears and the weight of a body hit the door

Frank drew strength from pure panic as he threw his weight against the
panel but perhaps an inch or two from the latch the door wavered from
opposing strength Through the narrow opening he could feel the hoarse
breath of exertion in his face Insane giggles and curses sounded
through the black stillness

Frank had the wild conviction he was losing the battle and added
strength came from somewhere He heaved and there was a scream and he
knew he had at least one finger caught between the door and the jamb He
threw his weight against the door with frenzied effort and heard the
squash of the finger The voice kited up to a shriek of agony like that
of a wounded animal

Even with his life at stake and the life of Nora Frank could not
deliberately slice the mans fingers off Even as he fought the urge
and called himself a fool he allowed the door to give slightly inward
The hand was jerked to safety

At that moment another door opened close by and Jim Wilsons voice
boomed What the hells going on out here

Simultaneous with this racing footsteps receded down the hall and from
the well of the stairway came a whining cry of pain

Jumping jees Wilson bellowed We got company We aint alone

He tried to get into my room

You shouldnt have opened the door Nora okay

Yeah Shes all right

Tell her to stay in her room And you do the same Wed be crazy to go
after that coot in the dark Hell keep til morning

Frank closed the door doublelocked it and went back to Noras bed He
could hear a soft sobbing He reached down and pulled back the covers
and the sobbing came louder Then he was down on the bed and she was in
his arms

She cried until the panic subsided while he held her and said nothing
After a while she got control of herself Dont leave me Frank she
begged Please dont leave me

He stroked her shoulder I wont he whispered

They lay for a long time in utter silence each seeking strength in the
others closeness The silence was finally broken by Nora

Frank

Yes

Do you want me

He did not answer

If you want me you can have me Frank

Frank said nothing

I told you today that I tried to commit suicide Remember

I remember

That was the truth I did it because I was tired of everything Because
Ive made a terrible mess of things I didnt want to go on living

He remained silent holding her

As she spoke again her voice sharpened Cant you understand what Im
telling you Im no good Im just a bum Other men have had me Why
shouldnt you Why should you be cheated out of what other men have
had

He remained silent After a few moments Nora said For Gods sake
talk Say something

How do you feel about it now Will you try again to kill yourself the
next chance you get

Nono I dont think Ill ever try it again

Then things must look better

I dont know anything about that I just dont want to do it now

She did not urge him this time and he was slow in speaking Its kind
of funny It really is Dont get the idea Ive got morals I havent
Ive had my share of women I was working on one the night they slipped
me the mickeythe night before I woke up to this tomb of a city But
nowtonightits kind of different I feel like I want to protect you
Is that strange

No she said quietly I guess not

They lay there silently their thoughts going off into the blackness of
the sepulchral night After a long while Noras even breathing told him
she was asleep He got up quietly covered her and went to the other
bed

But before he slept the weird wailings from out Evanston way came
againrose and fell in that strange conversational cadencethen died
away into nothing

                                   

Frank awoke to the first fingers of daylight Nora still slept He
dressed and stood for some moments with his hand on the door knob Then
he threw the bolt and cautiously opened the door

The hallway was deserted At this point it came to him forcibly that he
was not a brave man All his life he realized he had avoided physical
danger and had refused to recognize the true reason for so doing He had
classified himself as a man who dodged trouble through good sense that
the truly civilized person went out of his way to keep the peace

He realized now that that attitude was merely salve for his ego He
faced the empty corridor and did not wish to proceed further But
stripped of the lifelong alibi he forced himself to walk through the
doorway close the door softly and move toward the stairs

He paused in front of the door behind which Jim Wilson and Minna were no
doubt sleeping He stared at it wistfully It certainly would not be a
mark of cowardice to get Jim Wilson up under circumstances such as
these In fact he would be a fool not to do so

Stubbornness forbade such a move however He walked softly toward the
place where the hallway deadended and became a crosscorridor He made
the turn carefully pressed against one wall There was no one in sight
He got to the stairway and started down

His muscles and nerves tightened with each step When he reached the
lobby he was ready to jump skyhigh at the drop of a pin

But no one dropped any pins and he reached the modernistic glass
doorway to the drugstore with only silence screaming in his ears The
door was unlocked One hinge squeaked slightly as he pushed the door
inward

It was in the drugstore that Frank found signs of the fourthfloor
intruder An inside counter near the prescription department was red
with blood Bandages and firstaid supplies had been unboxed and thrown
around with abandon Here the man had no doubt administered to his
smashed hand

But where had he gone Asleep probably in one of the rooms upstairs
Frank wished fervently for a weapon Beyond doubt there was not a gun
left in the Loop

A gun was not the only weapon ever created though and Frank searched
the store and found a line of pocket knives still in neat boxes near the
perfume counter

He picked four of the largest and found also a woodenhandled
leadtipped bludgeon used evidently for cracking ice

Thus armed he went out through the revolving door He walked through
streets that were like death under the climbing sun Through streets and
canyons of dead buildings upon which the new daylight had failed to shed
life or diminish the terror of the night past

At Dearborn he found the door to the Tribune Public Service Building
locked He used the ice breaker to smash a glass door panel The crash
of the glass on the cement was an explosion in the screaming silence He
went inside Here the sense of desolation was complete brought sharply
to focus probably by the pigeon holes filled with letters behind the
wantad counter Answers to a thousand and one queries waiting
patiently for someone to come after them

Before going to the basement and the back files of the Chicago Tribune
Frank climbed to the second floor and found what he thought might be
therea row of teletype machines with a fileboard hooked to the side
of each machine

Swiftly he stripped the copy sheets off each board made a bundle of
them and went back downstairs He covered the block back to the hotel at
a dogtrot filled with a sudden urge to get back to the fourth floor as
soon as possible

Illustration

He stopped in the drugstore and filled his pockets with soap a razor
shaving cream and face lotion As an afterthought he picked up a lavish
cosmetic kit that retailed according to the price tag for thirtyeight
dollars plus tax

He let himself back into the room and closed the door softly Nora
rolled over exposing a shoulder and one breast The breast held his
gaze for a full minute Then a feeling of guilt swept him and he went
into the bathroom and closed the door

Luckily a supply tank on the roof still contained water and Frank was
able to shower and shave Dressed again he felt like a new man But he
regretted not hunting up a haberdashery shop and getting himself a clean
shirt

Nora had still not awakened when he came out of the bathroom He went to
the bed and stood looking down at her for some time Then he touched her
shoulder

Wake up Its morning

Nora stirred Her eyes opened but Frank got the impression she did not
really awaken for several seconds Her eyes went to his face to the
window back to his face

What time is it

I dont know I think its around eight oclock

Nora stretched both arms luxuriously As she sat up her slip fell back
into place and Frank got the impression she hadnt even been aware of
her partial nudity

She stared up at him clarity dawning in her eyes Youre all cleaned
up

I went downstairs and got some things

You went outalone

Why not We cant stay in here all day Weve got to hit the road and
get out of here Weve overshot our luck already

But thatthat man in the hall last night You shouldnt have taken a
chance

I didnt bump into him I found the place he fixed his hand down in
the drugstore

Frank went to the table and came back with the cosmetic set He put it
in Noras lap I brought this up for you

Surprise and true pleasure were mixed in her expression That was very
nice I think Id better get dressed

Frank turned toward the window where he had left the bundle of teletype
clips Ive got a little reading to do

As he sat down he saw from the corner of his eye a flash of slim
brown legs moving toward the bathroom Just inside the door Nora
turned Are Jim Wilson and Minna up yet

I dont think so

Noras eyes remained on him I think you were very brave to go
downstairs alone But it was a foolish thing to do You should have
waited for Jim Wilson

Youre right about it being foolish But I had to go

Why

Because Im not brave at all Maybe that was the reason

Nora left the bathroom door open about six inches and Frank heard the
sound of the shower He sat with the papers in his hand wondering about
the water When he had gone to the bathroom the thought had never
occurred to him It was natural that it should Now he wondered about
it Why was it still running After a while he considered the
possibility of the supply tank on the roof

Then he wondered about Nora It was strange how he could think about her
personally and impersonally at the same time He remembered her words of
the previous night They made herhe shied from the term What was the
old cliche A woman of easy virtue

What made a woman of that type he wondered Was it something inherent
in their makeup That partially opened door was symbolic somehow He was
sure that many wives closed the bathroom door upon their husbands did
it without thinking instinctively He was sure Nora had left it
partially open without thinking Could a behavior pattern be traced from
such an insignificant thing

He wondered about his own attitude toward Nora He had drawn away from
what shed offered him during the night And yet from no sense of
disgust There was certainly far more about Nora to attract than to
repel

Morals he realized dimly were imposedor at least functionedfor the
protection of society With society gonevanished overnightdid the
moral code still hold

If and when they got back among masses of people would his feelings
toward Nora change He thought not He would marry her he told himself
firmly as quick as hed marry any other girl He would not hold what
she was against her I guess Im just fundamentally unmoral myself he
thought and began reading the news clips

                                   

There was a knock on the door accompanied by the booming voice of Jim
Wilson You in there Ready for breakfast

Frank got up and walked toward the door As he did so the door to the
bathroom closed

Jim Wilson wore a twoday growth of beard and it didnt seem to bother
him at all As he entered the room he rubbed his hands together in great
gusto Well wherell we eat folks Lets pick the classiest
restaurant in town Nothing but the best for Minna here

He winked broadly as Minna expressionless and silent followed him in
exactly as a shadow would have followed him and sat primly down in a
straightbacked chair by the wall

Wed better start moving south Frank said and not bother about
breakfast

Getting scared Jim Wilson asked

Youre damn right Im scarednow Were right in the middle of a big
nomansland

I dont get you

At that moment the bathroom door opened and Nora came out Jim Wilson
forgot about the question hed asked He let forth a loud whistle of
appreciation Then he turned his eyes on Frank and his thought was
crystal clear He was envying Frank the night just passed

A sudden irritation welled up in Frank Brooks a distinct feeling of
disgust Lets start worrying about important thingsour lives Or
dont you consider your life very important

Jim Wilson seemed puzzled What the hells got into you Didnt you
sleep good

I went down the block this morning and found some teletype machines
Ive just been reading the reports

What about that guy that tried to get into your room last night

I didnt see him I didnt see anybody But I know why the citys been
cleaned out Frank went back to the window and picked up the sheaf on
clips he had gone through Jim Wilson sat down on the edge of the bed
frowning Nora followed Frank and perched on the edge of the chair he
dropped into

The city going to blow up Wilson asked

No Weve been invaded by some form of alien life

Is that what the papers said

It was the biggest and fastest mass evacuation ever attempted I pieced
the reports together There was hell popping around here during the two
days wewe waited it out

Where did they all go Nora asked

South Theyve evacuated a fortymile strip from the lake west The
first Terran defense line is set up in northern Indiana

What do you meanTerra

Its a word that means Earththis planet The invaders came from some
other planet they thinkat least from no place on Earth

Thats the silliest damn thing I ever heard of Wilson said

A lot of people probably thought the same thing Frank replied
Flying saucers were pretty common Nobody thought they were anything
and nobody paid much attention Then they hitthree days agoand wiped
out every living soul in three little southern Michigan towns From
there they began spreading out They

Each of them heard the sound at the same time A faint rumble
increasing swiftly into high thunder They moved as one to the window
and saw four jet planes in formation moving across the sky from the
south

There they come Frank said The fights started Up to now the army
has been trying to get set I suppose

Nora said Is there any way we can hail them Let them know

Her words were cut off by the horror of what happened As they watched
the plane skimmed low across the Loop At a point approximately over
Lake Street Frank estimated the planes were annihilated There was a
flash of blue fire coming in like jagged lightning to form four balls of
fire around the planes The fire balls turned almost instantly into
globes of white smoke that drifted lazily away

And that was all But the planes vanished completely

What happened Wilson muttered Whered they go

It was as if they hit a wall Nora said her voice hushed with awe

I think that was what happened Frank said The invaders have some
kind of a weapon that holds us helpless Otherwise the army wouldnt
have established this nomansland and pulled out The reports said we
have them surrounded on all sides with the help of the lake Were
trying to keep them isolated

Jim Wilson snorted It looks like weve got them right where they want
us

Anyhow were damn fools to stick around here Wed better head south

Wilson looked wistfully about the room I guess so but its a
shamewalking away from all this

Nora was staring out the window a small frown on her face I wonder
who they are and where they came from

The teletype releases were pretty vague on that

She turned quickly Theres something peculiar about them Something
really strange

What do you mean

Last night when we were walking up the street It must have been these
invaders we heard They must have been across the street But they
didnt act like invaders They seemedwell scared I got the feeling
they ran from us in panic And they havent been back

Wilson said They may not have been there at all Probably our
imaginations

I dont think so Frank cut in They were there and then they were
gone Im sure of it

Those wailing noises They were certainly signalling to each other Do
you suppose thats the only language they have Nora walked over and
offered the silent Minna a cigarette Minna refused with a shake of her
head

I wish we knew what they looked like Frank said But lets not sit
here talking Lets get going

Jim Wilson was scowling There was a marked sullenness in his manner
Not Minna and me Ive changed my mind Im sticking here

Frank blinked in surprise Are you crazy Weve run our luck out
already Did you see what happened to those planes

The hell with the planes Weve got it good here This I like I like
it a lot Well stay

Okay Frank replied hotly but talk for yourself Youre not making
Minna stay

Wilsons eyes narrowed Im not Look busterhow about minding your
own goddam business

The vague feelings of disgust Frank had had now crystallized into words
I wont let you get away with it You think Im blind Hauling her into
the back room every ten minutes Dont you think I know why Youre
nothing but a damn sex maniac Youve got her terrorized until shes
afraid to open her mouth She goes with us

Jim Wilson was on his feet His face blazed with rage The urge to kill
was written in the crouch of his body and the twist of his mouth You
goddam nosey little squirt Ill

Wilson charged across the short intervening distance His arms went out
in a clutching motion

But Frank Brooks wasnt full of knockout drops this time and with a
clear head he was no pushover Blinded with rage Jim Wilson was a
pushover Frank stepped in between his outstretched arms and slugged him
squarely on top of the head with the telephone Wilson went down like a
felled steer

The scream came from Minna as she sprang across the room She had turned
from a colorless rag doll into a tigress She hit Frank square in the
belly with small fists at the end of stiff outstretched arms The full
force of her charge was behind the fists and Frank went backward over
the bed

Minna did not follow up her attack She dropped to the floor beside Jim
Wilson and took his huge head in her lap You killed him she sobbed
Youyou murderer You killed him You had no right

Frank sat wideeyed Minna For Gods sake I was helping you I did it
for you

Why dont you mind your business I didnt ask you to protect me I
dont need any protectionnot from Jim

You mean you didnt mind the way hes treated you

Youve killed himkilled him Minna raised her head slowly She
looked at Frank as though she saw him for the first time Youre a
fool she said dully A big fool What right have you got to meddle
with other peoples affairs Are you God or something to run peoples
lives

MinnaI

It was as though he hadnt spoken Do you know what its like to have
nobody All your life to go on and grow older without anybody I didnt
have no one and then Jim came along and wanted me

Frank walked close to her and bent down She reacted like a tiger
Leave him alone Leave him alone Youve done enough

Nonplused Frank backed away

People with big nosesalways sticking them in Thats you Was that
any of your business what he wanted of me Did I complain

Im sorry Minna I didnt know

Id rather go into back rooms with him than stay in front rooms without
nobody

She began to cry now Wordlesslysoundlessly rocking back and forth
with the huge mans bloody head in her lap Anytime she crooned
Anytime I would

The body in her arms stirred She looked down through her tears and saw
the small black eyes open They were slightly crossed unfocused as they
were by the force of the blow They straightened and Jim mumbled What
the hellwhat the hell

Minnas time for talking seemed over She smileda smile hardly
perceptible as though it was for herself alone Youre all right she
said Thats good Youre all right

Jim pushed her roughly away and staggered to his feet He stood swaying
for a moment his head turning for all the world like a bull blinded
and tormented Then his eyes focused on Frank

You hit me with the goddam phone

YeahI hit you

Im gonna kill you

LookI made a mistake Frank picked up the phone and backed against
the wall I hit you but you were coming at me I made a mistake and
Im sorry

Ill smash your goddam skull

Maybe you will Frank said grimly But youll work for it It wont
come easy

A new voice bit across the room Cut it out Ill do the killing
Thats what I like best Everybody quiet down

They turned and saw a slim paleskinned young man in the open doorway
The door had opened quietly and no one had heard it Now the pale young
man was standing in the room with a small nickleplated revolver in his
right hand

The left hand was close down at his side It was swathed generously in
white bandage

The young man chuckled The last four people in the world were in a
room he said and there was a knock on the door

His chuckle deepened to one of pure merriment Only there wasnt a
knock A man just walked in with a gun that made him boss

No one moved No one spoke The man waited then went on My name is
Leroy Davis I lived out west and I always had a keeper because they
said I wasnt quite right They wanted me to pull out with the rest of
them but I slugged my keeper and here I am

Put down the gun and well talk it over Frank said Were all in
this together

No we arent Ive got a gun so that makes me top man Youre all in
it together but Im not Im the boss and which one of you tried to
cut my hand off last night

You tried to break in here yelling and screaming like a madman I held
the door What else could I do

Its all right Im not mad My typewe may be nuts but we never hold
a grudge I cant remember much about last night I found some whisky in
a place down the street and whisky drives me nuts I dont know what Im
doing when I drink whisky They say once about five years ago I got
drunk and killed a little kid but I dont remember

Nobody spoke

I got out of it They got me out some way High priced lawyers got me
out Cost my dad a pile

Hysteria had been piling up inside of Nora She had held it back but
now a little of it spurted out from between her set teeth Do
something somebody Isnt anybody going to do anything

Leroy Davis blinked at her Theres nothing they can do honey he
said in a kindly voice Ive got the gun Theyd be crazy to try
anything

Noras laugh was like the rattle of dry peas She sat down on the bed
and looked up at the ceiling and laughed Its crazy Its all so
crazy Were sitting here in a doomed city with some kind of alien
invaders all around us and we dont know what they look like They
havent hurt us at all We dont even know what they look like We dont
worry a bit about them because were too busy trying to kill each
other

Frank Brooks took Nora by the arm Stop it Quit laughing like that

Nora shook him off Maybe we need someone to take us over Its all
pretty crazy

Stop it

Noras eyes dulled down as she looked at Frank She dropped her head and
seemed a little ashamed of herself Im sorry Ill be quiet

Jim Wilson had been standing by the wall looking first at the newcomer
then back at Frank Brooks Wilson seemed confused as to who his true
enemy really was Finally he took a step toward Leroy Davis

Frank Brooks stopped him with a motion but kept his eyes on Davis
Have you seen anybody else

Davis regarded Frank with long careful consideration His eyes were
bright and birdlike They reminded Frank of a squirrels eyes Davis
said I bumped into an old man out on Halstead Street He wanted to
know where everybody had gone He asked me but I didnt know

What happened to the old man Nora asked She asked the question as
though dreading to do it but as though some compulsion forced her to
speak

I shot him Davis said cheerfully It was a favor really Here was
this old man staggering down the street with nothing but a lot of wasted
years to show for his efforts He was no good alive and he didnt have
the courage to die Davis stopped and cocked his head brightly You
knowI think thats whats been wrong with the world Too many people
without the guts to die and a law against killing them

It had now dawned upon Jim Wilson that they were faced by a maniac His
eyes met those of Frank Brooks and they wereon this point at leastin
complete agreement A working procedure sprang up unworded between
them Jim Wilson took a slow casual step toward the homicidal maniac

You didnt see anyone else Frank asked

Davis ignored the question Look at it this way he said In the old
days they had Texas long horns Thin stringy cattle that gave up meat as
tough as leather Do we have cattle like that today No Because we bred
out the weak line

Frank said There are some cigarettes on that table if you want one

Jim Wilson took another slow step toward Davis

Davis said We bred with intelligence with a thought to what a steer
was for and we produced a walking chunk of meat as wide as it is long

Uhhuh Frank said

Get the point See what Im driving at Humans are more important than
cattle but can we make them breed intelligently Oh no That
interferes with damn silly human liberties You cant tell a man he can
only have two kids Its his Godgiven right to have twelve when the
damn moron cant support three Get what I mean

Suresure I get it

You better think it over misterand tell that fat bastard to quit
sneaking up on me or Ill blow his brains all over the carpet

If the situation hadnt been so grim it would have appeared ludicrous
Jim Wilson feeling success almost in his grasp was balanced on tiptoe
for a lunge He teetered almost lost his balance and fell back against
the wall

Take it easy Frank said

Ill take it easy Davis replied Ill kill every goddam one of
you he pointed the gun at Jim Wilson starting with him

Now wait a minute Frank said Youre unreasonable What right have
you got to do that What about the law of survival Youre standing
there with a gun on us Youre going to kill us Isnt it natural to try
anything we can to save our own lives

A look of admiration brightened Davis eyes Say I like you Youre
all right Youre logical A man can talk to you If theres anything I
like its talking to a logical man

Thanks

Too bad Im going to have to kill you We could sit down and have some
nice long talks together

Why do you want to kill us Minna asked She had not spoken before In
fact she had spoken so seldom during the entire time theyd been
together that her voice was a novelty to Frank He was inclined to
discount her tirade on the floor with Wilsons head in her lap She had
been a different person then Now she had lapsed back into her old
shell

Davis regarded thoughtfully Must you have a reason

You should have a reason to kill people

Davis said All right if it will make you any happier I told you
about killing my keeper when they tried to make me leave town He got in
the car behind the wheel I got into the back seat and split his skull
with a tire iron

Whats that got to do with us

Just this Tommy was a better person than anyone of you or all of you
put together If he had to die what right have you got to live Is that
enough of a reason for you

This is all too damn crazy Jim Wilson roared He was on the point of
leaping at Davis and his gun

At that moment from the north came a sudden crescendo of the weird
invader wailings It was louder than it had previously been but did not
seem nearer

The group froze all ears trained upon the sound Theyre talking
again Nora whispered

Uhhuh Frank replied But its different this time As if

as if they were getting ready for something Nora said Do you
suppose theyre going to move south

Davis said Im not going to kill you here Were going down stairs

The pivotal moment hinged in Jim Wilsons mind that could have changed
the situation had come and gone The fine edge of additional madness
that would make a man hurl himself at a loaded gun was dulled Leroy
Davis motioned preemptorily toward Minna

You firstthen the other babe You walk side by side down the hall
with the men behind you Straight down to the lobby

They complied without resistance There was only Jim Wilsons scowl
Frank Brooks clouded eyes and the white taut look of Nora

Noras mind was not on the gun It was filled with thoughts of the pale
maniac who held it He was in command Instinctively she felt that
maniacs in command have one of but two motivationssex and murder Her
reaction to possible murder was secondary But what if this man insisted
upon laying his hands upon her What if he forced her into the age old
thing she had done so often Nora shuddered But it was also in her mind
to question and be surprised at the reason for her revulsion She
visualized the hands upon her bodythe old familiar things and the
taste in her mouth was one of horror

She had never experienced such shrinkings before Why now Had she
herself changed Had something happened during the night that made the
past a time of shame Or was it the madman himself She did not know

Nora returned from her musings to find herself standing in the empty
lobby Leroy Davis speaking to Frank was saying You look kind of
tricky to me Put your hands on your head Lock your fingers together
over your head and keep your hands there

Jim Wilson was standing close to the mute Minna She had followed all
the orders without any show of anger with no outward expression Always
she had kept her eyes on Jim Wilson Obviously whatever Jim ordered
she would have done without question

Wilson leaned his head down toward her He said Listen baby theres
something I keep meaning to ask but I always forget it Whats your last
name

TrumbleMinna Trumble I thought I told you

Maybe you did Maybe I didnt get it

Nora felt the hysteria welling again How long are you going to keep
doing this she asked

Leroy Davis cocked his head as he looked at her Doing what

Play cat and mouse like this Holding us on a pin like flies in an
exhibit

Leroy Davis smiled brightly Like a butterfly in your case honey A
big beautiful butterfly

What are you going to do Frank Brooks snapped Whatever it is lets
get it over with

Cant you see what Im doing Davis asked with genuine wonder Are
you that stupid Im being the boss Im in command and I like it I
hold life and death over four people and Im savoring the thrill of it
Youre pretty stupid mister and if you use that cant get away with
it line Ill put a bullet into your left ear and watch it come out
your right one

Jim Wilsons fists were doubled He was again approaching the reckless
point And again it was dulled by the gradually increasing sound of a
motornot in the air but from the street level to the south

It was a sane cheerful sound and was resented instantly by the insane
mind of Leroy Davis

He tightened even to the point that his face grew more pale from the
tension He backed to a window looked out quickly and turned back
Its a jeep he said Theyre going by the hotel If anybody makes a
move or yells theyll find four bodies in here and me gone Thats
what Im telling you and you know Ill do it

They knew he would do it and they stood silent trying to dredge up
the nerve to make a move The jeeps motor backfired a couple of times
as it approached Madison Street Each time Leroy Davis nerves reacted
sharply and the four people kept their eyes trained on the gun in his
hand

The jeep came to the intersection and slowed down There was a
conference between its two occupantshelmeted soldiers in dark brown
battle dress Then the jeep moved on up Clark Street toward Lake

A choked sigh escaped from Noras throat Frank Brooks turned toward
her Take it easy he said Were not dead yet I dont think he
wants to kill us

The reply came from Minna She spoke quietly I dont care I cant
stand any more of this After all we arent animals Were human beings
and we have a right to live and die as we please

Minna walked toward Leroy Davis Im not afraid of your gun any more
All you can do with it is kill me Go ahead and do it

Minna walked up to Leroy Davis He gaped at her and said Youre crazy
Get back there Youre a crazy dame

He fired the gun twice and Minna died appreciating the incongruity of
his words She went out on a note of laughter and as she fell Jim
Wilson with an echoing animal roar lunged at Leroy Davis His great
hand closed completely over that of Davis hiding the gun There was a
muffled explosion and the bullet cut unnoticed through Wilsons palm
Wilson jerked the gun from Davis weak grasp and hurled it away Then he
killed Davis

He did it slowly a surprising thing for Wilson He lifted Davis by his
neck and held him with his feet off the floor He squeezed Davis neck
seeming to do it with great leisure as Davis made horrible noises and
kicked his legs

Nora turned her eyes away buried them in Frank Brooks shoulder but
she could not keep the sounds from reaching her ears Frank held her
close Take it easy he said Take it easy And he was probably not
conscious of saying it

Tell him to hurry Nora whispered Tell him to get it over with Its
like killingkilling an animal

Thats what he isan animal

Frank Brooks stared in fascination at Leroy Davis distorted darkening
face It was beyond semblance of anything human now The eyes bulged and
the tongue came from his mouth as though frantically seeking relief

The animal sounds quieted and died away Nora heard the sound of the
body falling to the floora limp soft sound of finality She turned
and saw Jim Wilson with his hands still extended and cupped The
terrible hands from which the stench of a terrible life was drifting
away into empty air

Wilson looked down at his handiwork Hes dead Wilson said slowly He
turned to face Frank and Nora There was a great disappointment in his
face Thats all there is to it he said dully Hes justdead
Without knowing it for what it was Jim Wilson was full of the futile
aftertaste of revenge

He bent down to pick up Minnas body There was a small blue hole in the
right cheek and another one over the left eye With a glance at Frank
and Nora Jim Wilson covered the wounds with his hand as though they
were not decent He picked her up in his arms and walked across the
lobby and up the stairs with the slow quiet tread of a weary man

The sound of the jeep welled up again but it was further away now
Frank Brooks took Noras hand and they hurried out into the street As
they crossed the sidewalk the sound of the jeep was drowned by a sudden
swelling of the wailings to the northward

On still a new note they rose and fell on the still air A note of
panic of new knowledge it seemed but Frank and Nora were not paying
close attention The sounds of the jeep motor had come from the west and
they got within sight of the MadisonWell intersection in time to see
the jeep hurtle southward at its maximum speed

Frank yelled and waved his arms but he knew he had been neither seen
nor heard They were given little time for disappointment however
because a new center of interest appeared to the northward From around
the corner of Washington Street into Clark moved three strange
figures

There was a mixture of belligerence and distress in their actions They
carried odd looking weapons and seemed interested in using them upon
something or someone but they apparently lacked the energy to raise
them although they appeared to be rather light

The creatures themselves were humanoid Frank thought He tightened his
grip on Noras hand Theyve seen us

Lets not run Nora said Im tired of running All its gotten us is
trouble Lets just stand here

Dont be foolish

Im not running You can if you want to

Frank turned his attention back to the three strange creatures He
allowed natural curiosity full reign Thoughts of flight vanished from
his mind

Theyre so thinso fragile Nora said

But their weapons arent

Its hard to believe even seeing them that theyre from another
planet

How so They certainly dont look much like us

I mean with the talk for so long about flying saucers and space
flight and things like that Here they are but it doesnt seem
possible

Theres something wrong with them

This was true Two of the strange beings had fallen to the sidewalk The
third came doggedly on dragging one foot after the other until he went
to his hands and knees He remained motionless for a long time his head
hanging limply Then he too sank to the cement and lay still

The wailings from the north now took on a tone of intense agonygreat
desperation After that came a yawning silence

                                   

They defeated themselves the military man said Or rather natural
forces defeated them We certainly had little to do with it

Nora Frank and Jim Wilson stood at the curb beside a motorcycle The
man on the cycle supported it with a leg propped against the curb as he
talked

We saw three of them die up the street Frank said

Our scouting party saw the same thing happen Thats why we moved in
Its about over now Well know a lot more about them and where they
came from in twentyfour hours

They had nothing further to say The military man regarded them
thoughtfully I dont know about you three If you ignored the
evacuation through no fault of your own and can prove it

There were four of us Jim Wilson said Then we met another man Hes
inside on the floor I killed him

Murder the military man said sharply

He killed a woman who was with us Frank said He was a maniac When
hes identified Im pretty sure hell have a past record

Where is the womans body

On a bed upstairs Wilson said

Ill have to hold all of you Martial law exists in this area Youre
in the hands of the army

                                   

The streets were full of people now going about their business pushing
and jostling eating in the restaurants making electricity for the
lights generating power for the telephones

Nora Frank and Jim Wilson sat in a restaurant on Clark Street Were
all different people now Nora said No one could go through what
weve been through and be the same

Jim Wilson took her statement listlessly Did they find out what it was
about our atmosphere that killed them

Theyre still working on that I think Frank Brooks stirred his
coffee raised a spoonful and let it drip back into the cup

Im going up to the Chicago Avenue police station Wilson said

Frank and Nora looked up in surprise Frank asked Why The military
court missed itthe fact you escaped from jail

They didnt miss it I dont think I dont think they cared much Im
going back anyway

It wont be much of a rap

No a pretty small one I want to get it over with

He got up from his chair So long Maybe Ill see you around

So long

Goodbye

Frank said I think Ill beat it too Ive got a job in a factory up
north Maybe theyre operating again He got to his feet and stood
awkwardly by the table BesidesIve got some pay coming

Nora didnt say anything

Frank said Wellso long Maybe Ill see you around

Maybe Goodbye

                                   

Frank Brooks walked north on Clark Street He was glad to get away from
the restaurant Nora was a good kid but hellyou didnt take up with a
hooker A guy played around but you didnt stick with them

But it made a guy think He was past the kid stage It was time for him
to find a girl and settle down A guy didnt want to knock around all
his life

                                   

Nora walked west on Madison Street Then she remembered the Halstead
Street slums were in that direction and turned south on Wells She had
nine dollars in her bag and that worried her You couldnt get along on
nine dollars in Chicago very long

There was a tavern on Jackson near Wells Nora went inside The barkeep
didnt frown at her That was good She went to the bar and ordered a
beer and was served

After a while a man came in A middle aged man who might have just come
into Chicagowhose bags might still be at the LaSalle Street Station
down the block The man looked at Nora then away After a while looked
at her again

Nora smiled
