BENJAMIN FRANKLIN AND THE FIRST BALLOONS

BY ABBOTT LAWRENCE ROTCH


The recent bicentenary of Franklins birth which coincided with the
revival of interest in balloons makes this a timely topic especially
since Franklins descriptions of the first balloon ascensions are
almost unknown and do not appear among his philosophical papers The
five letters which I have the honor to present were written to Sir
Joseph Banks President of the Royal Society of London in  when
Franklin was Minister to the Court of France and with the collateral
documents they give perhaps the most complete and accurate account
of the beginning of aerial navigation enlivened with the humor and
speculation characteristic of the writer It is certainly remarkable
that Franklin in the midst of diplomatic and social duties could have
found time to investigate personally this new invention of which he at
once appreciated the possibilities

The documents which I publish are copies of Franklins letters made
on thin paper in a copying press probably the rotary machine invented
by Franklin and all but one bear his signature in ink They have
corrections in the authors handwriting and except for a few words
are quite legible They were purchased by me from Dodd Mead  Co
in December  and previously had belonged to G M Williamson
of GrandviewontheHudson to whom they had come from Vienna None
of the letters appear in Sparks edition of Franklins Works and
while all but one are included in the collections compiled by Bigelow
and Smyth there are numerous inaccuracies some of which will be
specified hereafter Drafts of three of the letters are deposited in
the University of Pennsylvania but the existence of one letter and the
whereabouts of another were unknown to the late Mr Smyth the editor
of the last and most complete edition of Franklins Works who made
careful search for the original documents Although the American owners
of these copies did not allow them to be transcribed Mr Smyth states
that he printed one letter from my copy and he noted how the other
copies differed from the drafts in the University of Pennsylvania In
general it may be said that whereas Bigelow gives the text without
paragraphs capital letters or the old spelling Smyth follows the
originals more closely In view of the historic and scientific interest
of these letters they are now printed exactly according to the
presscopies The letter dated November  appears never to have been
printed and whereas Smyth reproduced the letter of November  from the
University of Pennsylvania draft this or another draft or possibly
this copy was in the possession of the French aeronaut Gaston
Tissandier about

THE FIRST HYDROGEN BALLOON

PASSY Aug  

Sir

On Wednesday the th Instant the new aerostatic Experiment invented
by Messrs Montgolfier of Annonay was repeated by M Charles
Professor of experimental Philosophy at Paris

A hollow Globe  feet Diameter was formed of what is called in England
Oiled Silk here Taffetas gomm the Silk being impregnated with a
Solution of Gum elastic in Lintseed Oil as is said The Parts were
sewed together while wet with the Gum and some of it was afterwards
passed over the Seams to render it as tight as possible

It was afterwards filled with the inflammable Air that is produced by
pouring Oil of Vitriol upon Filings of Iron when it was found to have
a tendency upwards so strong as to be capable of lifting a Weight of 
Pounds exclusive of its own Weight which was  lbs and the Weight of
the Air containd

It was brought early in the morning to the Champ de Mars a Field in
which Reviews are sometimes made lying between the Military School and
the River There it was held down by a Cord till  in the afternoon
when it was to be let loose Care was taken before the Hour to replace
what Portion had been lost of the inflammable Air or of its Force by
injecting more

It is supposed that not less than  People were assembled to see
the Experiment The Champ de Mars being surrounded by Multitudes and
vast Numbers on the opposite Side of the River

At  aClock Notice was given to the Spectators by the Firing of two
Cannon that the Cord was about to be cut And presently the Globe was
seen to rise and that as fast as a Body of  feet Diameter with a
force only of  Pounds could be supposd to move the resisting Air
out of its Way There was some Wind but not very strong A little
Rain had wet it so that it shone and made an agreeable Appearance
It diminished in Apparent Magnitude as it rose till it enterd the
Clouds when it seemd to me scarce bigger than an Orange and soon
after became invisible the Clouds concealing it

The Multitude separated all well satisfied and delighted with the
Success of the Experiment and amusing one another with discourses of
the various uses it may possibly be applyd to among which many were
very extravagant But possibly it may pave the Way to some Discoveries
in Natural Philosophy of which at present we have no Conception

A Note securd from the Weather had been affixd to the Globe
signifying the Time  Place of its Departure and praying those who
might happen to find it to send an account of its State to certain
Persons at Paris No News was heard of it till the next Day when
Information was receivd that it fell a little after  aClock
at Gonesse a Place about  Leagues Distance and that it was rent
open and some say had Ice in it It is supposd to have burst by the
Elasticity of the containd Air when no longer compressd by so heavy
an Atmosphere

One of  feet Diameter is preparing by Mr Montgolfier himself at the
Expence of the Academy which is to go up in a few Days I am told it
is constructed of Linen  Paper and is to be filled with a different
Air not yet made Public but cheaper than that producd by the Oil of
Vitriol of which  Paris Pints were consumd in filling the other

It is said that for some Days after its being filled the Ball was
found to lose an eighth Part of its Force of Levity in  Hours
Whether this was from Imperfection in the Tightness of the Ball or a
Change in the Nature of the Air Experiments may easily discover

I thought it my Duty Sir to send an early Account of this
extraordinary Fact to the Society which does me the honour to reckon
me among its Members and I will endeavour to make it more perfect as
I receive farther Information

  With great Respect I am Sir
  Your most obedient
  and most humble Servant
  B FRANKLIN

SIR JOSEPH BANKS Bart

P S Since writing the above I am favourd with your kind Letter
of the th I am much obliged to you for the Care you have taken to
forward the Transactions as well as to the Council for so readily
ordering them on Application Please to accept and present my Thanks

I just now learn that some observers say the Ball was  Seconds
in rising from the Cutting of the Cord till hid in the Clouds
that its height was then about  Toises but being moved out of
the Perpendicular by the Wind it had made a Slant so as to form a
Triangle whose Base on the Earth was about  Toises It is said
the Country People who saw it fall were frightned conceivd from its
bounding a little when it touched the Ground that there was some
living Animal in it and attackd it with Stones and Knives so that it
was much mangled but it is now brought to Town and will be repaired

The great one of M Montgolfier is to go up as is said from
Versailles in about  or  Days It is not a Globe but of a different
Form more convenient for penetrating the Air It contains 
cubic Feet and is supposed to have Force of Levity equal to 
pounds weight A Philosopher here M Pilatre du Rozier has seriously
applyd to the Academy for leave to go up with it in order to make
some Experiments He was complimented on his Zeal and Courage for
the Promotion of Science but advisd to wait till the management of
these Balls was made by Experience more certain  safe They say the
filling of it in M Montgolfiers Way will not cost more than half
a Crown One is talkd of to be  feet Diameter Several Gentlemen
have ordered small ones to be made for their Amusement One has ordered
four of  feet Diameter each I know not with what Purpose But such
is the present Enthusiasm for promoting and improving this Discovery
that probably we shall soon make considerable Progress in the art of
constructing and using the Machines

Among the Pleasanteries Conversation produces on this Subject some
suppose Flying to be now invented and that since Men may be supported
in the Air nothing is wanted but some light handy Instruments to
give and direct Motion Some think Progressive Motion on the Earth
may be advancd by it and that a Running Footman or a Horse slung and
suspended under such a Globe so as to have no more of Weight pressing
the Earth with their Feet than Perhaps  or  Pounds might with a
fair Wind run in a straight Line across Countries as fast as that Wind
and over Hedges Ditches  even Waters It has been even fancied that
in time People will keep such Globes anchored in the Air to which by
Pullies they may draw up Game to be preserved in the Cool  Water to be
frozen when Ice is wanted And that to get Money it will be contrived
to give People an extensive View of the Country by running them up in
an Elbow Chair a Mile high for a Guinea c c

A HOT AIR BALLOON CARRYING ANIMALS

PASSY Oct  

Sir

The Publick were promised a printed particular Account of the Rise
 Progress of the Balloon Invention to be published about the End
of last month I waited for it to send it to you expecting it would
be more satisfactory than anything I could write but it does not
appear We have only at present the enclosed Pamphlet which does
not answer the expectation given us I send you with it some prints
That of the Balloon raised at Versailles is said to be an exact
representation I was not present but am told it was filled in about
ten minutes by means of burning Straw Some say water was thrown into
the flame others that it was Spirits of Sal Volatile It was supposed
to have risen about  Toises But did not continue long at that
height was carried horizontally by the Wind and descended gently
as the Air within grew cooler So vast a Bulk when it began to rise
so majestically in the Air struck the spectators with surprise and
Admiration The Basket contained a sheep a duck and a Cock who
except the Cock received no hurt by the fall

The Duke de Crillon made a feast last week in the Bois de Boulogne
just by my habitation on occasion of the Birth of two Spanish Princes
after the Fireworks we had a Balloon of about  feet Diameter filled
with permanent inflammable Air It was dismissed about One aClock in
the Morning It carried under it a large Lanthorn with inscriptions on
its sides The Night was quite calm and clear so that it went right
up The appearance of the light diminished gradually till it appeared
no bigger than one of the Stars and in about twenty minutes I lost
sight of it entirely It fell the next Day on the other side of the
same Wood near the Village Boulogne about half after twelve having
been suspended in the Air eleven hours and a half It lodged in a tree
and was torn in getting it down so that it cannot be ascertained
whether it burst when above or not tho that is supposed Smaller
Repetitions of the Experiment are making every day in all quarters
Some of the larger Balloons that have been up are preparing to be sent
up again in a few Days but I do not hear of any material improvements
yet made either in the mechanical or Chemical parts of the Operation
Most is expected from the new one undertaken upon subscription by
Messieurs Charles and Robert who are Men of Science and mechanic
Dexterity It is to carry up a Man I send you enclosed the Proposals
which it is said are already subscribed to by a considerable number
and likely to be carried into execution If I am well at the Time I
purpose to be present being a subscriber myself and shall send you an
exact Account of Particulars

  With great esteem and respect for yourself and the Society
  I have the honour to be

   most humble Servant

THE FIRST AERIAL VOYAGE BY MAN

PASSY Novr st 

Dear Sir

I received your friendly Letter of the th Inst I am glad my Letters
respecting the Aerostatic Experiment were not unacceptable But as more
perfect Accounts of the Construction and Management of that Machine
have been and will be published before your Transactions and from
which Extracts may be made that will be more particular and therefore
more satisfactory I think it best not to print those Letters I say
this in answer to your Question for I did not indeed write them with
a view of their being inserted Mr Faujas de St Fond acquainted me
yesterday that a Book on the Subject which has been long expected will
be publishd in a few Days and I shall send you one of them Enclosed
is a Copy of the Procs verbal taken of the Experiment made yesterday
in the Garden of the Queens Palace la Muette where the Dauphin now
resides which being near my House I was present This Paper was drawn
up hastily and may in some Places appear to you obscure therefore I
shall add a few explanatory Observations

This Balloon was larger than that which went up from Versailles and
carried the Sheep c Its bottom was open and in the middle of the
Opening was fixed a kind of Basket Grate in which Faggots and Sheaves
of Straw were burnt The Air rarified in passing thro this Flame rose
in the Balloon swelld out its sides and filld it

The Persons who were placd in the Gallery made of Wicker and attached
to the Outside near the Bottom had each of them a Port thro which
they could pass Sheaves of Straw into the Grate to keep up the Flame
 thereby keep the Balloon full When it went over our Heads we could
see the Fire which was very considerable As the Flame slackens the
rarified Air cools and condenses the Bulk of the Balloon diminishes
and it begins to descend If those in the Gallery see it likely to
descend in an improper Place they can by throwing on more Straw
 renewing the Flame make it rise again and the Wind carries it
farther

La Machine pousse par le Vent sest dirige sur une des Alles du
Jardin That is against the Trees of one of the Walks The Gallery
hitched among the top Boughs of those Trees which had been cut and were
stiff while the Body of the Balloon leand beyond and seemed likely to
overset I was then in great Pain for the Men thinking them in danger
of being thrown out or burnt for I expected that the Balloon being no
longer upright the Flame would have laid hold of the inside that leaned
over it But by means of some Cords that were still attachd to it it
was soon brought upright again made to descend  carried back to its
place It was however much damaged

Planant sur lHorizon When they were as high as they chose to be
they made less Flame and suffered the Machine to drive Horizontally
with the Wind of which however they felt very little as they went
with it and as fast They say they had a charming View of Paris 
its Environs the Course of the River c but that they were once
lost not knowing what Part they were over till they saw the Dome of
the Invalids which rectified their Ideas Probably while they were
employed in keeping up the Fire the Machine might turn and by that
means they were desorients as the French call it

There was a vast Concourse of Gentry in the Garden who had great
Pleasure in seeing the Adventurers go off so chearfully  applauded
them by clapping c but there was at the same time a good deal of
Anxiety for their Safety Multitudes in Paris saw the Balloon passing
but did not know there were Men with it it being then so high that
they could not see them

Dveloppant du Gaz That is in plain English burning more straw
for tho there is a little Mystery made concerning the kind of Air
with which the Balloon is filled I conceive it to be nothing more than
hot Smoke or common Air rarifyd tho in this I may be mistaken

Aiant encor dans leur Galerie les deux tiers de leur
Approvisionement That is their Provision of Straw of which they
carried up a great Quantity It was well that in the hurry of so
hazardous an Experiment the Flame did not happen by any accidental
Mismanagement to lay hold of this Straw tho each had a Bucket of
Water by him by Way of Precaution

One of these courageous Philosophers the Marquis dArlandes did me
the honour to call upon me in the Evening after the Experiment with
Mr Montgolfier the very ingenious Inventor I was happy to see him
safe He informed me that they lit gently without the least Shock and
the Balloon was very little damaged

This Method of filling the Balloon with hot Air is cheap and
expeditious and it is supposed may be sufficient for certain purposes
such as elevating an Engineer to take a View of an Enemys Army Works
c conveying Intelligence into or out of a besieged Town giving
Signals to distant Places or the like

The other Method of filling a Balloon with permanently elastic
inflammable Air and then closing it is a tedious Operation and
very expensive Yet we are to have one of that kind sent up in a few
Days It is a Globe of  feet diameter The Gores that compose it
are red and white Silk so that it makes a beautiful appearance A
very handsome triumphal Car will be suspended to it in which Messrs
Robert two Brothers very ingenious Men who have made it in concert
with Mr Charles propose to go up There is room in this Car for a
little Table to be placed between them on which they can write and
keep their Journal that is take Notes of every thing they observe the
State of their Thermometer Barometer Hygrometer c which they will
have more Leisure to do than the others having no fire to take Care
of They say they have a contrivance which will enable them to descend
at Pleasure I know not what it is But the Expence of this Machine
Filling included will exceed it is said  Livres

This Balloon of only  feet diameter being filled with Air ten times
lighter than common Air will carry up a greater Weight than the other
which tho vastly bigger was filled with an Air that could scarcely be
more than twice as light Thus the great Bulk of one of these Machines
with the short duration of its Power  the great Expence of filling
the other will prevent the Inventions being of so much Use as some may
expect till Chemistry can invent a cheaper light Air producible with
more Expedition

But the Emulation between the two Parties running high the Improvement
in the Construction and Management of the Balloons has already made
a rapid Progress and one cannot say how far it may go A few Months
since the Idea of Witches riding thro the Air upon a Broomstick and
that of Philosophers upon a Bag of Smoke would have appeared equally
impossible and ridiculous

These Machines must always be subject to be driven by the Winds
Perhaps Mechanic Art may find easy means to give them progressive
Motion in a Calm and to slant them a little in the Wind

I am sorry this Experiment is totally neglected in England where
mechanic Genius is so strong I wish I could see the same Emulation
between the two Nations as I see between the two Parties here Your
Philosophy seems to be too bashful In this Country we are not so much
afraid of being laught at If we do a foolish thing we are the first
to laugh at it ourselves and are almost as much pleased with a Bon
Mot or a good Chanson that ridicules well the Disappointment of
a Project as we might have been with its Success It does not seem
to me a good reason to decline prosecuting a new Experiment which
apparently increases the Power of Man over Matter till we can see to
what Use that Power may be applied When we have learnt to manage it
we may hope some time or other to find Uses for it as Men have done
for Magnetism and Electricity of which the first Experiments were mere
Matters of Amusement

This Experience is by no means a trifling one It may be attended with
important Consequences that no one can foresee We should not suffer
Pride to prevent our progress in Science Beings of a Rank and Nature
far superior to ours have not disdained to amuse themselves with making
and launching Balloons otherwise we should never have enjoyed the
Light of those glorious objects that rule our Day  Night nor have had
the Pleasure of riding round the Sun ourselves upon the Balloon we now
inhabit

THE SECOND AERIAL VOYAGE BY MAN

PASSY Dec  

Dear Sir

In mine of yesterday I promisd to give you an Account of Messrs
Charles  Roberts Experiment which was to have been made at this Day
and at which I intended to be present Being a little indisposd  the
Air cool and the Ground damp I declind going into the Garden of the
Tuilleries where the Balloon was placd not knowing how long I might
be obligd to wait there before it was ready to depart and chose to
stay in my Carriage near the Statue of Louis XV from whence I could
well see it rise  have an extensive View of the Region of Air thro
which as the Wind sat it was likely to pass The Morning was foggy
but about one aClock the Air became tolerably clear to the great
Satisfaction of the Spectators who were infinite Notice having been
given of the intended Experiment several Days before in the Papers
so that all Paris was out either about the Tuilleries on the Quays
 Bridges in the Fields the Streets at the Windows or on the Tops
of Houses besides the Inhabitants of all the Towns  Villages of the
Environs Never before was a philosophical Experiment so magnificently
attended Some Guns were fired to give Notice that the Departure
of the great Balloon was near and a small one was dischargd which
went to an amazing Height there being but little Wind to make it
deviate from its perpendicular Course and at length the Sight of it
was lost Means were used I am told to prevent the great Balloons
rising so high as might indanger its Bursting Several Bags of Sand
were taken on board before the Cord that held it down was cut and
the whole Weight being then too much to be lifted such a Quantity was
dischargd as to permit its Rising slowly Thus it would sooner arrive
at that Region where it would be in Equilibrio with the surrounding
Air and by discharging more Sand afterwards it might go higher if
desired Between One  Two aClock all Eyes were gratified with seeing
it rise majestically from among the Trees and ascend gradually above
the Buildings a most beautiful Spectacle When it was about  feet
high the brave Adventurers held out and wavd a little white Pennant
on both Sides their Car to salute the Spectators who returnd loud
Claps of Applause The Wind was very little so that the Object
tho moving to the Northward continued long in View and it was a
great while before the admiring People began to disperse The Persons
embarkd were Mr Charles Professor of Experimental Philosophy 
a zealous Promoter of that Science and one of the Messieurs Robert
the very ingenious Constructors of the Machine When it arrived at its
height which I suppose might be  or  Toises it appeared to have
only horizontal Motion I had a Pocket Glass with which I followd it
till I lost Sight first of the Men then of the Car and when I last
saw the Balloon it appeard no bigger than a Walnut I write this at 
in the Evening What became of them is not yet known here I hope they
descended by Daylight so as to see  avoid falling among Trees or on
Houses and that the Experiment was completed without any mischievous
Accident which the Novelty of it  the want of Experience might well
occasion I am the more anxious for the Event because I am not well
informd of the Means provided for letting themselves gently down and
the Loss of these very ingenious Men would not only be a Discouragement
to the Progress of the Art but be a sensible Loss to Science and
Society

I shall inclose one of the Tickets of Admission on which the Globe was
represented as originally intended but is altered by the Pen to show
its real State when it went off When the Tickets were engraved the
Car was to have been hung to the Neck of the Globe as represented by a
little Drawing I have made in the Corner A I suppose it may have been
an Apprehension of Danger in straining too much the Balloon or tearing
the Silk that inducd the Constructors to throw a Net over it fixd
to a Hoop which went round its Middle and to hang the Car to that
Hoop as you see in Fig B

Tuesday Morning Dec  I am relievd from my Anxiety by hearing
that the Adventurers descended well near lIsle Adam before Sunset
This Place is near  Leagues from Paris Had the Wind blown fresh they
might have gone much farther

If I receive any farther Particulars of Importance I shall communicate
them hereafter

  With great Esteem I am Dear Sir
  Your most obedient
   most humble servant
  B FRANKLIN

P S Tuesday Evening

Since writing the above I have receivd the printed Paper  the
Manuscript containing some Particulars of the Experiment which I
encloseI hear farther that the Travellers had perfect Command of
their Carriage descending as they pleasd by letting some of the
inflammable Air escape and rising again by discharging some Sand
that they descended over a Field so low as to talk with Labourers in
passing and mounted again to pass a Hill The little Balloon falling at
Vincennes shows that mounting higher it met with a Current of Air in a
contrary Direction An Observation that may be of use to future aerial
Voyagers

NOTES CONCERNING THE LETTERS

Letter of August  The handwriting is in a more flowing style than
the subsequent letters Bigelow omits paragraph ten beginning It is
said Both Bigelow and Smyth give another paragraph in the Postscript
beyond the signature B F in my copy also a note dated Sept d
which contains calculations in French relating to the balloon Smyth
says that these additions are not in the University of Pennsylvania
draft but that they occur in this presscopy which is obviously a
mistake In paragraph two of the Postscript movd out in Smyth
should read being moved out and in the last line but one upon
should read up in

Letter of October  In the eighth line after the word Balloon
Smyth inserts lately Part of the valedictory and the signature are
omitted by Bigelow and Smyth but the former gives an Extract of the
Proposals for the balloon of which I have no copy

Letter of November  This should be dated Nov  since the
ascension of dArlandes and de Rozier which according to the
letter took place the previous day is known to have been on the
st The orthography of the French words in Bigelow and Smyth does
not always agree with the copy In paragraph three for Post in
Smyth read Port in paragraph six for Adventures in Smyth read
Adventurers in paragraph thirteen for By the emulation in Smyth
read But the Emulation in paragraph fifteen for the phrase in
Smyth and Bigelow beginning I wish I could see the same emulation
correct to end between the two Nations as I see between the two
Parties here in paragraph sixteen in both Bigelow and Smyth for
Experiment read Experience and for the unintelligible phrase in
both Bigelow and Smyth Beings of a frank and sic nature read
Beings of a Rank and Nature Minor discrepancies between this and
the other presscopies and the letters as printed by Bigelow and Smyth
also occur The signature is in pencil in this copy A P S Nov
th is not in the presscopy contrary to Smyths statement but
I have a presscopy of the French ProcsVerbal therein referred
to in Franklins handwriting with his name and eight others affixed
as witnesses Neither Bigelow nor Smyth print this document which
was first reproduced in the book mentioned by Franklin in the first
paragraph of his letter viz Description des Expriences de la
Machine Arostatique par M Faujas de SaintFond Paris  Since
Franklins copy of the ProcsVerbal differs only in his spelling
the word sangfroid instead of sensfroid I do not print it
However other changes were introduced in the ProcsVerbal when
reprinted in the second volume of M Faujas work published in 
The plate forming the frontispiece to this volume shows the balloon as
seen from Mr Franklins terrace at Passy

Letter of November  This has never been published so far as I
know The Journal of the first Aerial Voyage here mentioned was
written by the Marquis dArlandes to M Faujas de SaintFond on Nov
th and first printed in the Journal de Paris but was republished by
Faujas de SaintFond in his second volume

Letter of December  Smyth states that he reproduced this
letter from my presscopy but he omits the capital letters and the
contractions in spelling as well as the references A and B which
are given by Bigelow with the remark that the drawings were not found
The Manuscript containing some Particulars of the Experiment which
I enclose mentioned in the Postscript is a twopage account in
French in Franklins handwriting by an eyewitness of the voyage M
le Chevalier de Cubire As this interesting document has never been
published to my knowledge I have given it here literatim from my
presscopy

Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support

Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included  Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition
