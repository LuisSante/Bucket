NOTE


This glossary does not aim at completeness and it is not primarily a
glossary of rare or hard words A good working knowledge of Middle
English depends less on the possession of an abstruse vocabulary than on
familiarity with the ordinary machinery of expressionwith the precise
forms and meanings that common words may assume with the uses of such
innocentlooking little words as the prepositions of and for with
idiomatic phrases some freshminted and some worn thin but all likely
to recur again and again in an age whose authors took no pains to avoid
usual or hackneyed turns of expression These are the features of the
older language which an English reader is predisposed to pass over
satisfied with a halfrecognition and space seldom permits of their
adequate treatment in a compendious general dictionary or the wordlist
to a single text So in making a glossary for use with a book itself
designed to be a preparation for the reading of complete texts I have
given exceptionally full treatment to what may rightly be called the
backbone of the language

Brief indications of the etymology of each word are given with
references in difficult cases to the Oxford English Dictionary
NED Apart from their usefulness as a basis for exercises in
phonology and the analysis of vocabulary these will serve to
differentiate words distinct in origin which coincide in some of their
forms or spellings The Old English or Old French forms cited are those
that best illustrate the Middle English in consequence the Old English
forms frequently differ from normal WestSaxon and the Old French forms
are especially those of the French current in England AngloFrench is
rarely specified Old Norse words have usually been cited in the normal
spelling eg of Zogas Old Icelandic Dictionary Accordingly long
vowels in Old Norse words are marked as in brr In Old English
words stable long vowels are marked as in brd uncertain quantity
or probable shortening in Old English times is marked as in
adrdd vowels that were lengthened in the Old English period
eg before ld mb nd are marked as in cld clmban
bndan

For the convenience of beginners the glossary is liberally supplied with
cross references and the prefixed Table summarizes the principal
variations of form or spelling Particular attention should be given to
the following points of arrangement i  has a separate
alphabetical place following G crossreferences to gh are not
given ii  has a separate alphabetical place following T
variation between  and th is disregarded and initial Th is
entered under  iii U V are alternative forms of the same
letter variation between them is disregarded and initial U is
entered under V iv Y initially has its usual place but medial or
final Y will be found in the alphabetical position of I

Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support

Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US

keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition
