INTRODUCTION

Opinion is a mighty matter in war and I doubt but the French think it
impossible to conquer an army that he leads and our soldiers think
the same and how far even this step may encourage the French to play
tricks with us no man knows

     the moment he leaves the service and loses the protection of
    the Court such scenes will open as no victories can varnish over

The career of John Churchill Duke of Marlborough reflects the
political battles of nearly thirty years of English politics In an
age when duplicity intrigue personality and an immediate history of
violence characterized politics John Churchill was a constant steady
military success even while his political and personal fortunes
alternately plunged and soared His military ability insured his
importance to the Grand Alliance and his victories brought the
reverence of the European powers opposing Louis XIV as well as that of
his own people but at the same time his successes also assured his
involvement with the fortunes of nearly every major English political
figure and movement in the years  to 

Marlboroughs military career spanned two periods Aware of the danger
of the exorbitant power of France and the corresponding danger to
the Protestant religion disgusted with Jamess actions at the
Gloucester shipwreck and in dealing with Scottish Protestants
Marlborough had joined the bloodless shift to William of Orange For
William he led the English forces in Flanders in  and in Ireland
in  in  he was in charge of the British forces in Europe with
the rank of lieutenantgeneral In January  however Marlborough
was dismissed from all of his offices for a combination of reasons
each insufficient in itself but all too typical for himopen
opposition to Williams Dutch dominated army rumors that he and
Sarah his ambitious and sometimes presumptuous wife were plotting
Annes usurpation of the throne and dissension aroused between Anne
and her sister Queen Mary by the quixotic Sarah When rumors of a
Jacobite uprising began Marlborough spent six weeks in the Tower

Although Marlborough was restored to political favor in  partly as
a placatory gesture to Anne it was  before he resumed his
military career this time as Williams CommanderinChief and
Ambassador Extraordinary to the United Provinces In this second phase
of his military career he won every battle took every fort that he
besieged held the Grand Alliance together broke the threatening
supremacy of France and established England as a major power Yet
during these ten years Queen Annes ministry and Parliament underwent
several major upheavals the resulting shifts in policy and
personalities alternately inconvenienced and vexed Marlborough The
year  marked the culmination of warring factions and clandestine
arrangement and Daniel Defoes A Short Narrative of the Life and
Actions of his grace John Duke of Marlborough published 
February  originated in this battle For discussion of
authorship please see Appendix

Much that happened in these years can be unraveled back to Harley
Earl of Oxford His influences and circuitous dealing emerge wherever
a close examination of politics is made Hiding his activities from
even his closest associates employing spies and journalists whose
purposes seem contradictory manipulating the House of Commons
radical October Club while preaching a broad bottomed moderate
government and buzzing in the Queens ear in a variety of ways
Harley was ready for any exigency England had wanted peace since 
when their insistence on no peace without Spain and on the XXXVII
Article asking for guarantees of three Spanish towns had rallied the
French behind the war Marlboroughs pleas that peace be made and
Spain be dealt with later were ignored Although Parliament voted
Malplaquet a triumph Marlboroughs power and prestige were
systematically shorn away and embarrassing decisions contrived to
force his resignation were effected Should Marlborough resign a
scapegoat for defeat or an unfavorable peace would be assured By
 foreign policy had changeda growing interest in trade and
colonization urged Parliament to end a costly and now unnecessary war
and had united the Tories Jacobites the Church party as well as
such diverse men as the Dukes of Argyll Somerset Newcastle and
Shrewsbury a Whig With the election of the radical Tory majority
 new members were seated to the Commons in  and the creation
of twelve new peers Harleys job of using diverse elements to form
a moderate government became more complex He found it expedient to
establish and maintain influence with groups ranging from the radical
Tory October Club to Swifts country squire and clergy Examiner
readers to moderate Whigs such as Shrewsbury Moreover Defoe had
impressed upon him the importance of assuring the nation that moderate
and sensible men were at the bottom of all of the political
changes Harley therefore prepared for at least three apparently
exclusive possibilitiesprosecuting the war for several more years
negotiating a peace with the Allies or making a separate peace with
France without the Allies To keep all these possibilities alive
Harley had to remain in harmony with Marlborough The generals
popularity with the soldiers and the European powers and Frances awe
of his military prowess necessitated the appearance that Marlboroughs
command was secure While the Examiner with its Tory audience and
its emphasis on pressure for peace was essential to Harley so were
Swifts and Defoes appeals for moderation at a time when sympathy for
Marlborough was rampant and the call no peace without Spain was
still defended even by the October Club for the same reasons he was
glad to have Bolingbroke openly associated with the Examiner

January of  brought the decisive defeat at Brihuega which
effectively took the issue of Spanish succession away in the ensuing
witch hunt Almanza and the peace talks of  were revived to
distract the people While these inquiries proceeded England received
word that France was ready to discuss terms The delay between this 
February and Frances formal proposal  May was an anxious time for
Harley and his schemers Defoe was busy setting the stage for the
outcome

While Swift the high Tory could easily set about discrediting
Marlborough the hero and standard bearer and by so doing weaken
the Whigs position Defoes readers required different handling His
most effective writing at this time was in pamphlets which reached a
wider audience and which were not bound by the consistency of the
Review Defoe and Swift primed with the Ministers inside knowledge
set about to discredit the Whig ministry in basically the same way In
the  February Examiner Swift wrote

    No Body that I know of did ever dispute the Duke of Marlboroughs
    Courage Conduct or Success they have been always unquestionable
    and will continue to be so in spight of the Malice of his Enemies
    or which is yet more the Weakness of his Advocates The Nation
    only wished to see him taken out of ill Hands and put into better
    But what is all this to the Conduct of the late Ministry the
    shameful Mismanagements in Spain or the wrong Steps in the Treaty
    of Peace 

Defoe remarks our General wants neither Conduct or Courage and
describes his greatest successes as daughters to preserve his Memory
while dissociating him somewhat from the Jacobites Whigs and
business of making peace and war When the Review finally
discusses Marlboroughs fall Defoe suggests that the greatest Guilt
 is the Error in Policy and Prudence among his Friends Both
writers presented the Duke as a means to an end and discredited him on
personal grounds avarice ambition thereby protecting the military
hero and the newborn glory of England fathered by his victories
Faced with Dissenters and moderate Whig readers Defoes Review had
to seem to oppose Swifts Examiner with its sneers at trade not only
must it be consistent but it was obliged to shift its readers
attention more slowly to the earlier failures of the Whig ministry and
the rich commercial advantages gained in the separate peace

The Life of Marlborough is part of a stream of pamphlets which Defoe
wrote supporting the Harley administration A Supplement to the Faults
on Both Sides a discussion of the Sacheverell case by two displacd
officers of state Rogues on Both Sides a study in contrasts
between old and new Whigs and old high flyer and new Tories and A
Seasonable Caution to the General Assembly were published immediately
before and after That same year his pamphlets discuss the October
Club the Spanish succession Mr Harley and the state of religion
By summer when the peace was nearly assured though still secret Defoe
was writing Reasons for a Peace Or the War at an End

Taken in chronological order Defoes  pamphlets indicate two
emerging directions first the reasons for ending the war become more
positive and entirely unconcerned with the General and second
Defoes comments about the Duke become less wholeheartedly admiring
especially in No Queen Or No General Rogues on Both Sides is
witty praise for moderate men who act according to English principles
of Law and Liberty regardless of People and Party rather than
believing any demagogue who cries it rains butterd Turnips After
this the pamphlets become more informative and solemnDefoe
demonstrates Whigs and Tories want the same things and that the country
bleeds to death Armageddon or the Necessity of Carrying on the War
 October  Reasons Why This Nation Ought to put a speedy End
to this Expensive War  October and Reasons for a Peace or the
War at an End for example catalog the economic ailmentstaxes
pirates hard to replace sailors and soldiers killed but far worse a
decline in trade resulting in closed shops and declining manufacturing
increasing unemploymentthe whole Kingdom sold to Usury and
Consumption of the Growth of the Country As the year passed Defoe
mentioned Marlborough less and less but the Generals possible
mistakes were progressively forced into balance with his victories
While seeming to be moderate Defoe both tempers his readers opinions
of the Duke and turns their attention to other issues

The techniques and movement in No Queen Or No General  January
 parallel the techniques and movement in the  pamphlets In
this  pamphlet Defoes doubleedged balance sheet is most obvious
in the first six pages he lists the charges against the General which
he will not discussthis reminds his readers of every possible failing
and because of the language Ile forbear to lessen his Glorious
Character by Reckoning the Number of the Slain or counting the Cost of
the Towns the significance of each ignored charge is increased
Defoe recounts the economic issues at stake and insists that when
Marlboroughs blinded party made him its representative regardless
of his intentions he became a formidable threat to the Queen and had
to be removed The pamphlet gradually turns to the destructiveness of
party factions and by the patriotic ending Alas what a Condition
were Britain in if her Fate depended upon the Life or Gallantry or
Merit of one Man Marlborough is no longer an issue

In the Life Defoe defends the general from the charge of avarice
the most plausible charge that the journalists were propagating
Marlboroughs courage and skill had also been called into question in
such papers as The Post Boy and a spurious debate raged which could
only injure Marlborough over the gratitude of the nation Defoe alludes
to pamphlets which impugn great men and represent them as unworthy of
the Favour of the Prince slanting the charge that Marlborough had been
rewarded perhaps too bountifully in order to imply that such writers
were malicious uninformed and ungrateful Furthermore Defoe says
Marlborough deserved his reward having bought it at a dear rate and
it was no more than what in all Times belongd to Generals Indeed
Marlboroughs successor the Duke of Ormond received the same bread
perquisite and percentage of foreign pay but Defoe chooses to defend
Marlborough not with comparable facts which would destroy the
credibility of the attacking group but rather with passing references
to the two other generals with whom he had to divide the money and with
the profits of sea captains and petty clerks in yards and stores With
descriptions of the fitting appearance for generals and Marlboroughs
sobriety in the field Defoe tips the scales in Marlboroughs favor
That he ends the section with

    Indeed Generals tho the most accomplishd Heroes are but Men
    they are not Infallible but may be mistaken as well as other
    Mortals they are subject to Faults and Infirmities as well as
    their FellowCreatures but then their great Services for the good
    of their Country ought to be cast into the Ballance against their
    humane Mistakes and not only Charity but Selfconsideration
    should give them very good Quarter unless their Faults are provd
    to be Wilful and Contumacious

is a paradigm of his technique Coming immediately after this defense
the argument that his victories should be cast in the Ballance is
somewhat degrading and implies that Marlborough may have been mistaken
in what he did and even leaves the question open with the phrase
unless their Faults are provd Wilful and Contumacious The
following paragraph however opens the subject of Marlboroughs
invincibility Under the guise of wondering what an ungrateful nation
would do should he lose a battle Defoe brings Marlboroughs perfect
record his piety and the esteem France and his soldiers had for him
to our attention The paragraph before then may be taken to introduce
Defoes concerneven Marlborough could be mistaken in battle and lose
and what would such a nation do then The paragraph on the whole
reflects on the nation and is an eloquent defense of the Dukehe is
human human beings make mistakes and his great good should excuse him
even more than an ordinary mans mistakes should be forgiven

Harley knew that Marlborough was essential until peace negotiations
were secured Marlborough had distrusted Harley throughout  but he
also knew that Harleys stakes in a moderate government were great In
 Rochester and the October Club began to challenge Harley and
their demands alarmed even Queen Anne The Queen Bolingbroke and
Harley all wrote Marlborough conciliatory letters Marlborough answered
in kind and his letter after Harley was stabbed expresses deep concern
Harley became increasingly convinced that only peace would preserve his
power and Marlboroughs power and reputation were essential for an
acceptable peace As late as July Harleys letters to Marlborough are
respectful and deceitfully warm

    My lord I received from the hands of lord Mar just as I came from
    Windsor the honour of your graces letter and I am not willing to
    let a post pass without making your grace my acknowledgments It
    is most certain that you can best judge what is fit to be proposed
    upon the subject you are pleased to mention

    I hope it will be needless to renew the assurances to your grace
    that I will not omit any thing in my power which may testify my
    zeal for the public and my particular honour and esteem for your
    grace and I doubt not but when the lord you mention comes I
    shall satisfy him of the sincerity of my intentions towards your
    grace

Harleys perfidy allowed him to assure Marlborough he would never do
any thing which shall forfeit your good opinion while pretending to
plan to restore Marlborough to the Queens confidence Further when
Marlborough appealed to him to silence the libellous attacks by
journalists Harley replied I do assure your grace I neither know nor
desire to know any of the authors and as I heartily wish this
barbarous war was at an end I shall be very ready to take my part in
suppressing them Details about the financing of Woodstock and
mutual friends crop up in the letters So successful is Harleys
deception that when Sir Solomon Medina accuses Marlborough of graft
Marlborough writes Harley

    Upon my arrival here I had notice that my name was brought before
    the commissioners of accounts possibly without any design to do me
    a prejudice However to prevent any ill impression it might make
    I have writ a letter to those gentlemen  and when you have taken
    the pains to read the inclosed copy pray be so kind as to employ
    your good offices so as that it may be known I have the advantage
    of your friendship No one knows better than your lordship the
    great use and expence of intelligence and no one can better
    explain it and tis for that reason I take the liberty to add a
    farther request that you would be so kind to lay the whole on
    some fitting opportunity before the queen being very well
    persuaded her majesty who has so far approved and so well
    rewarded my services would not be willing they should now be
    reflected on

Defoe points out that criticism of the Duke may prove Dangerous and
Fatal and the joy in the French court at each step in Marlboroughs
fall reinforces Defoes and Harleys opinion Defoe recounts
Marlboroughs greatest military victories beginning as far back as his
campaign in Brabant reminding his readers of possible wealth gained
through a shipwreck and of the betrayal of Dunkirk as he goes along
includes descriptions of his exemplary behavior including regular
prayers for the Camp and praises Marlborough as a finishd Hero The
conclusion to the pamphlet warns the nation again of Marlboroughs
importance his battles are bringing the enemy to reason procuring
an honorable and lasting peace References to the detrimental effect
of discrediting the general are found intermittently throughout the
pamphlet in allusion to Hannibal

Defoe then served Harleys purposes well He defended Marlborough and
shored up his prestige in a time when it was important for the French
to think that Marlborough could prosecute the war freely As a known
employee of Harleys Defoe furthered Marlboroughs impression that
Harley could be depended upon Finally he began to prepare the
moderate Whigs for peace by presenting the economic considerations and
disassociating Marlborough from the Queens and the ministrys
business of peace

The possibility that Defoe acted independently in this writing cannot
be discounted Defoe had praised Marlborough since the beginning of
his career and the extent to which he and Godolphin adopted Williams
policies added to Defoes admiration admiration is clear in this
pamphlet Defoe had worked for Godolphin and Sunderland and may have
used by an Old Officer in the Army as a disguise from Harley or even
as a means of publishing independently That Defoe resented attacks on
his hero can hardly be doubtedthe Review and his pamphlets are
a catalog of the generals triumphs and no where does he attack
unequivocably even in No Queen he puts chief blame on rumors and on
Marlboroughs party Harleys failure to make permanent provisions for
Defoe may suggest some dissatisfaction but even if the possibility
that the Life was not expressly ordered by Harley is considered it
is noteworthy that nothing in it is offensive to Harley and more
important remarkable that it serves Harleys needs and ends at the
time so well

Definitely Defoes however are veiled but telling attacks on Swift
and his type Although the purpose of the Examiner was to furnish
Mankind with a Weekly Antidote to that Weekly Poison Defoe
parodied this by saying his pamphlet was to undeceive the People The
base Pamphleteers are labeled uninformed and ungrateful they have
no way of making right judgments in the matter of perquisites and
soldiers pay they go out to see a battlefield as they might a well
laidout garden and of course their Mouths go off smartly with a
Whiff of Tobacco an obvious ridiculing contrast to the cannon fire of
the real fighters

Furthermore compared to attacks on Marlborough in libels such as The
Duke of Ms Confessions to a Jacobite Priest The LandLeviathan
or the Modern Hydra and The Perquisite Monger Defoes pamphlet
was exemplary in its moderation Even Swifts attacks are moderate
beside the majority of these  pamphlets not even he conjured
up memories of regicide and rebellion as did the more numerous and
libellous pamphleteers For example The Mobbs Address to my Lord
M  linked Marlborough to Sacheverell and assured the Duke his
most dutiful Mobb will use our utmost Care and Diligence to raise all
riotous and tumultous Assemblys and with undaunted Vigour  oppose
 all who will keep up the Authority of the Crown Olivers
Pocket Looking Glass  while more erudite was scarcely less
inflammatoryshades of Cromwell were called up a Colossus with an
Army composd of almost all nations faced the body politic

The Life exemplifies many of Defoes life long interests and opinions
and points to the fiction he was to write Virtues espoused throughout
his career are praised here Ingratitude was a deplorable but all too
common failing of mankindthat Marlborough should be undervalued and
slighted was no new Thing all the Histories of the World are full of
Examples to this purpose and his greatness provides but a mark at
which the envious may shoot In Atalantis Major Defoe elaborates on
the causes of the nations ingratitude the debt was too great for
payment and resentment was the natural result A second interest was
the military hero much of Defoes fictionMemoirs of a Cavalier
Captain Singleton for instanceinvolved military men and
Marlborough along with King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden another
soldier who scorned the conventional seventeenth century chess game
tactics furnished a model The finishd Hero described includes all
of the virtues of Defoes fictional leaders from Robinson Crusoe to
John in Journal of the Plague Year to the CavalierPrudent and
Vigilant and Temperate Alert and industrious with an humble
Submission to the Will of the Almighty  Temperate Sober
Careful Couragious Politick Skilful so he is Courteous Mild
Affable Humble and Condescending to People of the meanest Condition
 The Dukes virtues as well as Gustavuss enable the reader of
Memoirs of a Cavalier and The Memoirs of Captain George Carlton to
judge the commanders as Defoe would have Above all the assured
Skill and daring Courage appealed to DefoeRobinson Crusoes
campaigns against the cannibals and in the Far East repeat the daring
riskall quality of Ramilles Defoes enjoyment of marching vicariously
over great battles has led biographers such as J R Moore to say that
it was unfortunate his military genius was never used and is
obvious in almost all of his fiction So skillful are his descriptions
that J H Burton pauses to note the character and claims of a book
Memoirs of Capt George Carlton  that has afforded him
valuable instruction on the general character of the war along with
special instructions in its leading events

Defoes Life was his first biography other memoirs of the Duke of
Melfort  Daniel Williams  and Major Ramkins 
suggest the progression to The Life and Strange Surprizing Adventures
of Robinson Crusoe  and two other lives in that same year
Defoes sometimes troublesome skill with narrative voices is in the
Life a shadow of the competence displayed in Moll Flanders
Although the old Officers voice is sustained and there are excellent
touches the distinctiveness and absorbing intimacy are only hinted at
The polemist appeals too apparently to his readers while the opening
pages approach a declamation The persona protests that he doesnt
pretend in this Narrative to Inform the great People at Court
concerning this thing and that he writes only for the common people
Defoe does limit carefully his material to events which were common
knowledge or would have been open to an old soldierwhile he describes
the key maneuver of Ramilles he certainly lacks a complete overview
Many of the virtues praised would appeal most strongly to men who might
have been common foot concerned with regular bread a wellrun camp
and a conscientious strategist or to simple pious women glad to hear
that their general prayed and provided Sunday sermons Allusions to
Satan the cunning engineer Solomon and Moses were common enough
while those to Hannibal and Raleigh had been exploited in Defoes
other writing Perhaps the most graphic section in this voice is the
description of the common soldiers misery in a rainy season march and
siege A few passages have the confidential gossipy tone of ordinary
people around a tavern tableSarah was admired abroad but in her own
country it was said she was guilty of more Folly than a Retainer to
the College in MooreFields an experienced old general knows more
coffeehouse quarterbacks and the soldier naively speculates with
relish how my Lord narrowly escaped being torn in Pieces for the
rumor that he spoke words which would be brutal from the mouth of
a Porter Naive arguments no man would continue in so hard an
undertaking from selfish motives sincere patriotism defense of his
King and Queen and praise for a nation with a generous Race of Warlike
People ready to risk their lives and honest indignation at
barbarous Lies authenticate the narrator

Defoes writingfiction and nonfictionis all of a piece The same
subjects and opinions reoccur and the techniques and style are nearly
indistinguishable Expository material alternates with narrative
examples which may in turn be followed by a paragraph or two drawing a
conclusion or a moral in all of his writing The primary difference
is in the length of the narrative examplesin the fiction they are
naturally much longer Over the years they become increasingly
dramatic as may be seen in books such as The Fortunate Mistress and
Conjugal Lewdness A Short Narrative conforms to this structural
pattern Sentences which direct the readers attention to this
structure are common For instance Defoe defends Marlboroughs courage
with descriptions of the battle of Brabant Ramilles references to
Hannibal and concludes And thus then you see that our General wants
neither Conduct or Courage Defoes skill with these short dramatic
illustrative examples developed with the years Defoe was always
concerned with presenting a case clearly and persuasively Clearly
marked structure and reasonable conclusions alternate with anecdotes
and reminiscences intended to hold the readers interest and dramatize
Defoes points

Defoes Life of Marlborough serves as a kind of barometer for the age
and for Defoe A reliable if sketchy list of the Dukes military
successes and the major charges raised against him at various times
during his life may be matched to the struggles in the English
government and on the continent The time had nearly come for the
Jacobites whom Marlborough had offended by deserting James and the
Tories who had long thought him a presumptuous general and a former
Tory or a lukewarm Tory as Marlborough might have thought himself who
had perverted a Tory Queen brought the Bill of Occasional Conformity
to defeat and driven Tories out of office to collect the debt that
they felt Marlborough owed them The biography written in the interim
between two foreign policies when so many momentous plans were
proceeding backstage mirrors the age It is also a barometer by which
Defoes development can be measured his journalistic involvement and
employment his nonfiction techniques as well as his progress toward
the fiction are implied

  This is similar to an argument Defoe uses to distinguish between
types of debtors in the Review iii  and  Whether or
not the crime was Wilful was very important to Defoe perhaps his
revised opinion of Marlborough as most obvious in his tribute to him
at his death is the result of his change of opinion about Marlboroughs
motives and removing him from the list of heroes who possessed the
courage of honor as described in An Apology for the Army

 Defoe discusses this in Robinson Crusoe Serious Reflections
and a Collection of Miscellaney Letters and several other places He
says for example

The custom of the ancients in writing fables is my very laudable
pattern for this and my firm resolution in all I write to exalt

A short NARRATIVE OF THE ACTIONS

Of his GRACE John Duke of Marlborough


Seeing the Press is open and every body dares Write and Publish what
he pleases and Persons of the highest Honour and Virtue to the great
Shame and Scandal of our Country are exposd to the World in base
Pamphlets and according to the Malice or Misunderstanding of the
Authors are represented to the World unworthy of the Favour of the
Prince as well as Obnoxious to the CommonWealth in which they live
It becomes every honest Man who knows more of the Matter to set
things in a true Light to undeceive the People as much as he is able
that they may be no longer imposd on by such false Reports which in
the end may prove Dangerous and Fatal

There is nothing new saith Solomon under the Sun the same Causes
will always produce the same Effects and while Mankind bear about
them the various Passions of Love and Joy Hatred and Grief the
cunning Engineer that stands behind the Curtain will influence and
work these Passions according to his Malice to the destruction of
Persons of highest Worth

I shall therefore give a short Narrative of the Actions of the most
Illustrious John Duke of Marlborough with some Reflections on
them that People may not wonder how it comes to pass that such a
Great Captain equal no doubt to any in all Ages considering the
Powers whom he has Opposd after all his Victories should be
represented in the publick Writings of the Town as overHonoured and
overPaid for all his past Services and neglected and almost forgotten
in the midst of all his Triumphs and his Name almost lost from the
Mouths of those People who for several Years last past and not many
Months since have been filld with his Praises

The first time that I had the Honour of seeing John Earl of
Marlborough for so I shall call him till he was created a Duke was
at a place calld Judoigne in Brabant where our Army was Encampd
I think about three Months after the late King was Crownd He was sent
over the Kings Lieutenant with the British Forces under his
Command which could then be spared for that Service Our united Forces
were Commanded in general by the Old Prince Waldeck

After several Marches we came to the Confines of Haynault within a
League of a small Town calld Walcourt and on St Lewiss Day a
Saint supposd to be prosperous to the French Nation their Army
Commanded by Mareschal dHumiers very betimes in the Morning
Marched to Attack us

An English Colonel guarded a Pass towards the aforesaid little Town
to which the Enemy bent their Course and being in Distress was
relievd by my Lord in Person who ordred his Retreat to such an
Advantage that he flankd the Enemy with perpetual Fire and this was
the first Cause that coold them in their Design of pushing our Army

At his return the Prince receivd him with a great deal of
Satisfaction and assured him that he would let the King know that he
saw into the Art of a General more in one Day than others do in a
great many Years

At the end of this Campaign my Lord Marlborough was ordered with
half of the Forces under his Command to Embark for Ireland where I
come to relate what he performed there As soon as he arrived in the
Harbour of Kingsale having Landed his Forces without the least loss
of Time Marched directly to the Fort or Citadel of that Place which
is a strong Fortification and at that time well provided with a good
Garrison and all things necessary for a strong Defence

My Lord did not stand to use Forms with them which might look like a
Siege but with a conquering Resolution and perpetual Volleys so
terrified them that they soon Surrendred

And now at this Place it was where the Dukes Actions began to be
Envied and evil Reports touching his good Name and Reputation were
industriously spread abroad and I am apt to believe such back Friends
as these will hardly leave him so long as he remains in the World

There was a Ship at that time in the said Harbour which twas reported
had some Money on Board for paying of the Forces in these Parts which
Ship by some untimely Accident was blown up and lost and presently
after it was given out by some ill People there present with my Lord
and by them sent into England to their Party that he had gotten the
Money beforehand to himself and that the Ship was destroyed by his
Contrivance that he had vast Sums of Money in Holland and at
Venice nay some went farther and affirmed that he had settled a
good Fund upon Occasion at Constantinople And I am sure some such
like Reports and palpable Falsities are continued on him to this very
Day

And now I suppose it could not be in this Year that the strong City of
Dunkirk was to be betrayed by the Governour of it and Surrendred to
some of the Kings Forces

In the next Campaign in Flanders the Old Waldeck was severely
beaten by Duke Luxembourg at the Battle of Flerus We were only
Six Battalions of British left in Ghent under the Command of the
then Brigadier Talmach We had Orders to march and to join the grand
Army at least a Fortnight before the Fight happened but as we were
about to march out of the City the City Gates were shut against us by
the People of that Place because we had no Money to pay our Quarters

Mr Sizar whom my Lord brought over with him the Year before was
our PayMasterGeneral and at this time was gone down into Holland
to get some Money upon Credit till our Supply was returned from
England and then I remember there was a barbarous Lie spread up and
down among us that our Money was kept in the Hands of Merchants by the
contrivance of my Lord and Mr Sizar that they might reap such a
particular Benefit which could not be much for the use of it

Waldeck being beaten the Elector of Brandenbourg for supporting
of him was obligd by long Marches to come and join us after which
nothing more of Consequence happened this Year And now I suppose it
could not be in this Year that Dunkirk was to be given up to some
party of the Kings Forces both his Majesty and my Lord Marlborough
being absent from us and we had no Marches towards that part of the
Country and good Reason for it for we could not if we would

I come now to our third Campaign which was made in Flanders and if
ever Dunkirk was to be betrayed in some secret manner to the late
King and if ever the Secret thereof was reveald by his Majesty to the
Earl of Marlborough and if my Lord did reveal the same weighty
Secret to his Wife and if by her it was discovered to her Sister at
St Germans and by her to the French King it must be placed in
this Year or else it must be extra anni solisque Vias the Lord
knows when and where

I am sure that the pretended Discovery of this same Secret hath lain
hard on my Lords Name for a great many Years and upon most Discourses
of the Affairs in Flanders that business of Dunkirk is trumpd up
against my Lord to this very Day

For as soon as this Story was sent abroad it flew like Lightening and
like the sham tragical Report which was put upon the Irish at the
Revolution it was scattered over all the Kingdom in an instant The
loss of Dunkirk is not to be forgotten and tis fresh in the Minds
of the common People both in Town and Country and not only the
Farmers over a Pot of Ale at Market will shake their Heads at
Malbur for so they call him for losing of Dunkirk but also
Gentlemen of good Rank and Condition believe it to be true and talk of
it with a great deal of Regret to this very time I dont pretend in
this Narrative to Inform the great People at Court concerning this
thing without doubt they very well know there was no great matter in
this mighty Secret but most of it a design to Disgrace my Lord
Marlborough that he might the more easily be turnd out of his
Places at Court and in the Army I write this to the common People
only to vindicate the Innocent and to undeceive a good part of the
Nation who have not had an Opportunity to be better Informed

This Summer then being our Third Campaign the King came to the Army
and with Him my Lord Marlborough and several other Persons of
Quality Among the rest was Count Solmes a nigh Relation to his
Majesty and Colonel of the great Regiment of Dutch Blue Guards and
then it was after two or three Marches that my Lord was observd to be
somewhat neglected and his Interest in the Army to decay and cool and
upon a certain Morning as we were in full March a Man might judge by
what then happened that it was so For it seems the Count had ordered
his Baggage and Sumpters to take Place of my Lords and to cut them
out of the Line of which Affront my Lord being informd by his
Servants soon found him out and having causd his Baggage to enter
the Post which was his due with his Cane lifted up and some hard
Words in French twas thought by a great many that it would end in a
single Combat but the Count thought fit to shear off and we heard no
more of it

All this Summer was spent in a great many Marches after the French
to bring them to a Battle but they Industriously and Artfully declind
it The Summer being spent the King committed the Army again to Prince
Waldeck and went in haste to the Hague Our Regiment was sent to
Garrison at Mechlen where came the Dutch Foot Guards to Winter
also Count Solmes as he designed for Holland took this City in
his way and there he assured a certain English Colonel who not long
before had been checkd by my Lord about some Disorders in his
Regiment that the Earl of Marlborough had made his Peace with
France and in a short time he would hear that he would be calld to
an Account for it

When I went to England that same Winter my Lords Appartments were
at the Cockpit Twas fine to see them full of Gentlemen and
Officers of all Ranks as they are now to be seen every Day at his
Levee at St Jamess but no sooner had my Lord Sidney brought him
word from the King that His Majesty had no farther Service for him in
the Court or in the Army but my Lord was forsaken by all his Shadows
and his House left in a profound Silence

Now a Person of my Lords high Posts especially having been so
eminently instrumental in the Revolution could not be well laid aside
from all his Employments without some Reasons were given to the People
for it and in a short time the pretended Reasons were produced and
they prevailed mightily

The first was That at the Kings Levee at the putting on of the Shirt
my Lord should speak scornfully of the Person of the King who at the
same time having made a great Spitting for his Majesty was a long time
troubled with a Consumptive Cough that my Lord should say to some
Gentlemen nigh him that he wishd it might be his last

As soon as this gross Affront was made known to the King by a certain
Party who can calumniate stoutly and blast as well as blacken it was
in a Moment all over the Court and Town and tis a wonder my Lord was
not torn in Pieces

But now to the Truth of this Matter My Lord has been always esteemd a
nice Courtier well guarded in his Words and one of the most Mannerly
bestbred Men of the Nation and no Man of Sense can believe that a Man
of his Character could be so Indiscreet as to drop such Words which
would be Barbarous and Brutal from the Mouth of a Porter much more
from the Lips of a NobleMan and a General

The other Reason was That through his or his Ladys Treachery or
Indiscretion the contrivance about Dunkirk was discovered to the
French or else tis very probable it would have been in our
Possession And now to clear this Aspersion also

Dunkirk is supposd to be one of the strongest Fortresses of
Europe either by Sea or Land the French King by vast Labour Art
and Cost having made it to be so and accordingly regards it with a
careful Eye always keeping in it a good Garrison with all manner of
Plenty for the Defence of it The next Garrisons of ours towards that
Place were Bruges Ostend and Newport the nighest is
Newport a small Fortress on the Sea and about twenty Miles from
Dunkirk we had no Marches towards any of these Places all this
Campaign neither was it known that any Detachment was sent that way
either in Summer or Winter Scarce less than a body of Three Thousand
Men would suffice to secure that City if it were to be betrayed to
them now how such a Party could march over so many Canals Morasses
and Trenches in that low Country some part of the Enemys  most part
of it their Friends unobserved and not lookd after especially a
Royal Army of theirs being at Hand is not easie to be conceived by any
Person who understands the Business of a Soldier Tis a great Hazzard
a nice Difficulty for a French Governour to betray a strong City
unless all his Officers be in the Secret and then tis wonderful if
by some one or other it is not revealed or else he has with him in the
Place several good Officers who understand the Duty as well as
himself and very probable that one or more of them may have private
Instructions to have an Eye upon him and to keep him in View Every
one that has a Command knows his AlarmPost and every hour Night and
Day the Majors or their Aids or some other Officers go their Rounds
upon the Walls all the Year long in Places of so great Importance As
for the betraying of it to any Naval Forces I suppose twas never
thought on unless the whole Garrison with the Burghers should give
their Consent and stand idly gazing on whilst the Ships were
approaching Indeed there was once a Design upon some Seaport of this
Garrison to shake and shatter it with a Vessel which was called for
that purpose The Terrible Machine it made a horrible Crack when it
was Fired and so the Engine and the Design vanishd in Smoak

But now admitting that all this was true and that there was a
Contrivance to put Dunkirk into our Hands and the Plot was
discovered and the Governour was hangd which upon strict Enquiry no
one could tell whom he was or when or where he was Executed yet why
must my Lord Marlborough or his Lady be the Betrayers of this
weighty Secret If it was for a good Reward I suppose no one living
can tell how or when or where it was paid And what great Services my
Lord has done for the French King for a great many Years to this
very Day let the World judge

But to put all this Matter out of doubt our most Gracious Sovereign
Lady the QUEEN who was then Princess was at that time the best Judge
of this Untruth cast upon them for notwithstanding the high
displeasure of the Court she always gave them Umbrage and Protection
which without doubt she would not have done unless she was thoroughly
persuaded of their Innocence

To be short my Lord was a true Lover of the Interest of his Country
and a true Member of the Church of England and most Places of State
and Power were in the Hands of such Persons who seemd to depress the
Fences of the Church and favour the Dissenters and their Favourers
the Whigs So twas not thought convenient that my Lord should be
admitted into their Secrets upon which they gave him a good Name and
turned him out

My Lord was no sooner discharged of his Places but like the old
Roman Dictator with the same calmness of Temper he retired from the
highest Business of State to his Villa in the Country but he shewd
himself as skilful an HusbandMan as he had been a Soldier But here
he could not long enjoy the Quiet which he sought but the same Malice
found him here which had turnd him from the Court from hence he was
taken and clapd up into the Tower where most of Friends thought he
would have lost that Head which has since done so much good to his
Queen and Country

And thus I have shewd how very much my Lord has been obliged to the
Whigs in those Days The Jacobites at this time were not behind hand
with him in their good Wishes but all they could do was to Rail and
call Names and so promise their good Nature when twas in their
Power

The King who was certainly an able Judge of Men had never time enough
to be acquainted with the excellent Merits of this Noble Lord but he
was blasted by His Enemies before his Virtues were sufficiently made
known to Him

But when several great Men who were true Lovers of their Country had
fully informd his Majesty that my Lord was always his most faithful
Servant and Subject and most willing to serve Him to the utmost of his
Power and that twas pity such an able Man should be laid by as
useless and forgotten My Lord was brought again to the Kings nearer
Conversation and after the late Peace as his Majesty found himself
decaying in his Health and the French King dealing more and more
every Day insincerely with him and his Allies he chose him again his
General and his Ambassador to the States and having brought him to
Holland that he might be fully instructed in all the necessary
Affairs of both Nations he recommended him to his Successor our most
Gracious QUEEN as the only fit Person whose Spirit might encounter
the Genius of France and strangle their Designs of swallowing
Europe

No sooner had our Sovereign Lady Queen ANNE mounted the Throne but in
concert with her High Allies she proclaimd War against France and
having created my Lord Duke of Marlborough she sent him her
Plenepotentiary into Holland to the States and Captain General of
Her Forces and I am sure a great many Officers who had servd under
him in the former War were glad to see him once more at the Head of an
Army

In the beginning of this first Year of the War the French Army
under the Conduct of Mareschal Boufflers was a little beforehand
with us and came into the Field stronger than ours some Troops of the
Allies having not yet joind us The French had coopd up our Army
under the Walls of Nimeguen and much ado we had by frequent
Skirmishes to hinder them from investing that considerable Frontier
at that time unprovided by the neglect of the Governour as tis
reported of all warlike Necessaries for the Defence of it A Man might
then see but an indifferent Ayre in the face of our Forces The States
were under great Apprehensions least the Enemy should penetrate into
their Country and nothing could recover them from their Fears till
his Grace after three or four Days had joind our Army with some
additional Troops upon his Approach we had immediately a new Scene of
Affairs each Soldier seemd to receive a new Life by the Cheerfulness
of their Officers and he presently assured the Deputies of the States
that the French should be no longer their bad Neighbours but he
would oblige them to March farther off that Country and that with a
Witness They were like People in a Trance and could hardly believe
that their Affairs had receivd so happy a turn accordingly we
marchd and having passed the Maes Coasted along that side of
Brabant which lies towards that River towards the open Country of
Mastricht and Luickland and not long after almost in Sight of
their Army we opened that noble River to the great Benefit of the
Trade of the Country having taken from the French the Fortresses of
Stochum of Stevenswaert of Ruremond and Venlo and at last
the strong Cittadel and City of Liege with a vast quantity of Cannon
and Prisoners the French not daring to relieve any of them by
venturing a Battle

In this Campaign our General shewd himself a true Master of his Art
having outdone the French Mareschal in every March When he came into
Holland he was receivd into their Cities as their Tutelar Angel
and their own Generals came to thank him for this happy Campaign
without any sign of Envy

When he returned to England he was well receivd by the Queen his
Mistress and with the Joy of all good People but then there was some
allay to this good Fortune several People were heard to Grumble that
after this Manner we should not get to Paris in a long time and a
Speech was Printed as if a Peer of the Realm had been the Author of
it with some ironical Touches on the Duke about raising the ancient
Valour of the Nation and that twas unreasonable that one Man should
have a KingKey which should open every Door in the Nation

About this time also Pamphlets began to fly much reflecting on the
Countess of Marlborough which I think have not ceasd but very much
increased against her every Year to this very Day I never had the
Honour to see that Lady but once at the Hague she was there with
her Husband the last time our late King was in that Country and it
was a common Report at that Court among a great many Gentlemen of
very good Quality that she was esteemed there among the Foreign
Ladies one of the best bred Women of her Age and here are Ladies from
most Courts of Europe who without doubt are the nicest Judges But
to be sure here at home they give her Name very poor Quarters and make
her guilty of more Folly than a Retainer to the College in
MoorFields

It will be too long for me to set down the particular Victories of
every Campaign and I hope no need of it because tis probable they
are fresh in the Memory of every good Subject His wonderful and
conquering March to the Banks of the Danube His artful Passing the
French Lines purely owing to his own good Conduct His Beating each
one of the French Great Mareschals round in their Turns in several
well fought Battles A People who for an Age had bullied the rest of
Europe and had taught other Nations the Art and Tactiques of War as
well as their Modes and Language Their Captivd Generals and Conquered
Towns perhaps the Strongest in the Universe demonstrate not only his
Wisdom Skill and Conduct but also his surmounting Courage and
unwearied Labour

And now at first View a Man might wonder how it should come to pass
that such a Renownd General after so many Signal Services and great
Actions for the good of his Country should be so undervalued and
slighted at his return home from the very middle of his Labours by any
one who pretends to value the good of his Nation But this is no new
Thing all the Histories of the World are full of Examples to this
purpose and most of them of Men of War and Great Captains

Sir Walter Raleigh has mustered up a long Roll of Glorious Sufferers
from the most ancient to his own Times and in the Condition in which
he then was might have brought in himself for a remarkable Sharer For
the most eminent Virtues are but as so many fair Marks set up on high
for Envy to shoot at with her poysonous Darts and in all States tis
sometimes dangerous to be Great and Good for cunning Envy is often
very strong and when once its Devices are effectually spread in the
Mouths of the Multitude will produce a Blast able to blow down the
most lofty Cedar Tis therefore for the good of the common People of
the Nation that I shall let them see the scandalous Reflections which
are scattered abroad on the Honour of the Duke of Marlborough and
when I have shewn to any rational Man that they are all False
Unreasonable and Malicious I have my End

The first Scandal that is put abroad upon his Grace is this That he
has avoided several Opportunities of Fighting not considering the
great burden of Taxes that lies upon the Nation because the War should
be continued longer whereby he may increase his Riches and keep up
his Power Now how false this Report is will easily appear

For the Business of Peace and War does not depend on a General Tis
the Business of his Monarch who best knows the proper times for such
Treaties Other Princes are concernd in the War as well as ours and
their Subjects are as desirous of Peace as any of us can be yet this
Peace cant well be obtaind without a joint Consent but if the Enemy
against whom we Fight will not come to any terms of Peace that are
Reasonable and Honourable and Just and upon which the War is
founded but in his pretended Treaties chicanes and falsifies and is
altogether Insincere then tis not the Generals Fault if we cant
have Peace we are in for the War and we must stand to it

Indeed in the last dear Year of Corn France was almost reduced to
their last Shifts their Sufferings could be calld little less than a
Famine and most of the Powers of Europe did really believe that they
must have sued for a Peace if they had not been assisted but whilst
the Circumstances of this Peace were in Agitation then did the good
People of Great Britain and Ireland the north part of them to
Burgundy and Champaign by way of Holland thro the Maes and
the South Part of them from Dunkirk and Calais overagainst Kent
beyond the Mouth of the Garroon on the Western Ocean supply that
Country with vast quantities of Corn almost to the starving of their
own People Not one of them cried out for Peace or blamd the General
their Pockets being well filld But swore in the Markets over
plentiful Nappy that in a short time they would pull old Lewis out
of his Throne

As for our Generals avoiding Fighting tis easie to guess out of what
Quiver this Arrow of Scandal was drawn for without doubt twas forgd
in his own Army and seeing the Roman History is now much in Fashion
I shall give an Example as an Answer to this Scandal and without
doubt tis home to the Purpose Haniball had beaten the Romans in
three great Battles of Ticinum Trebia and Thrasymene Twas his
Business to Fight the Romans wherever he could come at them his Army
being compounded of rough old Mercenary Soldiers of divers Nations who
are ready to Mutiny and Desert upon all Occasions if they have not
present Pay or continual Plunder in this Extremity the old Fabius
was chosen Dictator or supream Commander he was a good Man of War
and understood his Business and for his Lieutenant or Master of the
Horse which among them was all one he chose one Minutius the worst
thing that ever he did because in a short time he found him to be an
Ungrateful Conceited Hotheaded Accuser Fabius with great skill
and caution avoided Battle by Coasting Hanibal on the sides of Hills
in rough Ground by Woods and Rivers and hard Passes because much
inferior in Horse to the Carthaginian and thereby gaind time to
confirm the Hearts of his Soldiers and so make them capable by degrees
to look the Enemy in the Face Hanibal soon found that by no means he
could draw in this wary old Gamester but declard that he feard
nothing more than that Clowd which hung about the Hill Tops least some
time or other it should fall down and severely wet him Winter coming
on and the Dictator being obliged to return home about some other
Affairs He left his Army to the Care of this Master of the Horse with
a strict charge to shun Fighting with all possible Care and to follow
the Example which he had set before him He was prowd of this
Opportunity of Commanding the Army and believd himself the best and
the ablest Man for it he procured to have his Courage magnified at
home among the common People and that if he had a Command equal to the
Captain General he would soon give a better Account of Hanibal and
his Army that Fabius was afraid to look towards his Enemy and
thereby disheartned the Soldiers who were otherwise naturally Brave
and by his Fearfulness suffered these Barbarians to Ravage in their
Country to their Ruine and Destruction The Tribunes of the People
not much better than Captains of the Mob were his particular Friends
and they complaining to the Senate every where gave it out that after
this manner of Fabius his going on the War would never have an end
that the City would be undone by perpetual Taxes that all Trade was
ceasd and nothing to be seen among the Commons but a sad Prospect of
growing Poverty

The Senate was wearied out by these Factious Importunities till at
last twas granted that the Master of the Horse should have equal
Command with that Great Man who would preserve them from Ruine
Accordingly he receivd half of the Army to be under his Charge by a
Lot for Fabius would not endure because he foresaw what would come
to pass that it shoud be in his Power for one Day to command the
whole Minutius forsooth to show his Bravery marchd nearer to the
Enemy Hannibal had laid a Train for the Hotspur and soon caught
him and both he and his Army had been soon cut to pieces if the Old
General not permitting private Revenge to interfere with the good of
his Country had not drawn down in very good Order repulsd the
Ambush and securd his Retreat The best thing that Minutius coud
do was to beg Pardon for his Fault and promise more regard to his
Superiors for the future So that you see tis the Experiencd
Skilful Old General who is best Judge of times of Fighting and that
Man who asperses his Honour is to be suspected as either wanting
Judgment or an Enemy to the Publick

Another Scandal was lately raisd against his Grace as touching his
good Conduct and Skill as he is a General and this is much among
those sort of People whose Mouths go off smartly with a Whiff of
Tobacco and fight Battles and take Towns over a Dish of Coffee They
give out like Men of great Understanding in the Art Military that the
Duke is more beholding to his GoodFortune than his Skill in the
Advantages he has gaind over the French and that he may thank the
Prince of Savoy and the good Forces which he Commands more than his
own Skill in War for his great Reputation

The GoodFortune of His Grace ought to be attributed to the good
Providence of GOD for which both he and the whole Nation ought to be
thankful Tis a great Happiness to have such a Fortunate General and
without doubt the French King would purchase such another at any
rate if he could

But then Nullum numen abest si sit Prudentia The General that is
Prudent and Vigilant and Temperate Alert and Industrious with an
humble Submission to the Will of the Almighty takes the right way of
obliging Fortune to be of his Side Or to speak better the Blessings
of Heaven to crown his Endeavours For in War tis seldom known quite
contrary to the Old Proverb that in conducting Armies and fighting
Battles Fools have Fortune

As for his Acting in Concert with the Heroick Prince of Savoy who
is without doubt one of the ablest Generals of the Universe and
chusing of him to be his Friend and Colleague is one of the strongest
Arguments of his Art and Knowledge Mutual Danger and mutual
Principles of Honour have entirely united them In all difficult
Points they presently agree as if what one was Speaking the other was
Thinking of the same Matter at the very same time And no Person can
believe that Prince Eugene would endure that any Person in the World
should share with him in his Fame and Glory unless such an Hero whom
he thinks in all Points to be his Equal As for the Troops under his
Command tis evident to the World that they excel all others for the
sake of their Countries they are prodigal of their Blood and under
such a General by their own Confession when they go to Action think
of nothing else but Victory and Triumph

But Matters of Fact are the best Arguments Amongst the great number
which might be producd I shall only Instance these two following and
I am sorry that those People who have not seen Marching or Embatteling
Armies cannot be competent Judges of them Let the first be in the
first Campaign in the first Year of Her Majestys Reign We were
encampd on the Confines of Brabant not far from a little Town
calld Peer the Country round about is almost all great Heaths and
large Commons we were in full March betimes in the Morning and by
the countenance of our March twas supposd we should have a long and
a late Fatigue when on a sudden about Eleven a Clock we had Orders
to halt and to encamp at the bottom of an Heath behind some rising
Grounds and great SandHills near a Place called Hilteren and
according to the Time that my Lord Duke had projected Mareschal
Boufflers with his Army was blunderd upon us within Shot of our
Cannon not knowing where we were At that time we were superior to the
French especially in Horse they could by no means avoid a Battle
the Mareschal was caught And if the Deputies of the States and their
Generals could have been perswaded to venture a Battle in conjunction
with the other Allies and they were entreated enough almost with
Tears by all the other Princes and Generals of the Army tis very
probable the French under that great surprize had been severely
beaten At last they stole away from us in a dark Night and were glad
of the Escape And thus then you see the great Skill of our General to
entrap the French Mareschal in his March in the middle of the Day
and to make him in a manner fall into his Arms


The second Instance is from the Battle of Ramelies A Stratagem well
laid argues the great Dexterity and Penetration of a General in deep
hollow Ways in close Bottoms and nigh sides of Woods Ambuscades are
often laid and perhaps as often discovered but to bring an Ambush
upon an Enemy into the open Country in the face of the Sun requires
an assured Skill as well as a daring Courage Thus tis said of the
Great Hannibal at the Battle of Cann that in the open Field he
brought an Ambush on the Backs of the Romans which very much helpd
to encrease their Terror and Confusion And thus did our General at
the forementiond Battle but with a better Contrivance

The French King had Intelligence given him that all the Forces of
our Army were not joind and accordingly sent positive Orders to his
General not to let slip that Opportunity of chastising the Insolence
of the Allies for that was the Expression and indeed twas true the
Allies had been pretty bold with him several times before and the
Mareschal doubted not but to have time enough to execute his Masters
Commands before a good Body of Horse which he understood to be at a
great distance could be able to come up and assist us The Duke gave a
pretty good Guess at the Monsieurs Designs and beforehand had sent
strict Order that they without the least delay should speed
immediately towards him and in the middle of the Night to halt at a
Village where he had appointed not above two Leagues from his Camp
and after a little Refreshment and Preparation for Service must be
ready to move at break of Day upon the first bruit of Cannon For
their resting in that Place and at such a distance would be much more
to his Advantage than if they had joind him

The Business being thus orderd he was resolvd the Enemy should not
take all the Pains in coming towards him but to meet them on part of
the Way The French Right Wing in which were their best Troops
opposd our Left and in their vigorous Charge had the better of the
Allies The Duke with the other Generals rallied them again but
finding it difficult to sustain the strong Impression of the Enemy
presently gave out and it took among all the Squadrons in a Moment
That a great number of the best Troops in the World who were their
Friends were just at their Heels with Sword in hand ready to sustain
them that no Power of the Enemy could look them in the Face which
being seen to be true as well as felt by the Enemy they were soon
repulsed discouragd and put into Confusion which was the first
cause of the general Rout of their Army


And thus then you see that our General wants neither Conduct or
Courage And as twas once said to that Renownd Captain Epaminondas
who having no Children and being about to die of his honourable
Wounds that his two Battels of Leuctra and Mantina should be as
two fair Daughters to preserve his Memory So may we say that the many
Battles and Sieges fought and won by our Great Marlborough in the
Provinces of Gelders of Limbourg of Brabant of Flanders of
Artois of Hainault shall be far excelling the most numerous
Progeny to eternize his Name

The other false Reports that are spread among the People by the
Enemies of the Duke are these That his way of Living in the Army is
Mean and Parsimonious unbecoming the Honour and Dignity of his Post
That the Income and Revenue from the Profits of his Places are too much
for a Subject And that he minds nothing so much as getting of Riches
All which Reports are false and malicious and only the Designs of his
secret Enemies

Wo be to them that call Evil Good and Good Evil Some of this was
part of the False Accusation that was urged against Scipio the
Asiatic by the Malice and ill Nature of Cato and his Accomplices
That he had squandred away the Money of the Government in a great
measure by his excessive Way of Living for so his Magnificence was
termed by them That his vast Treats and luxurious Tables had some
popular Design And to be sure if our General should offer to live
after any such manner the Nation would be filld with perpetual
Clamour that he treated the Officers to make them his Creatures and
in a short time would set up for himself for without doubt those
things which other Men might do tho much inferior to the Duke with a
general Applause in him would be Criminal and of bad Consequence

In all ancient Histories nothing is more highly praisd in Princes and
great Captains than Temperance and Moderation in Meat and Drink The
Commander of the Army ought to be vigilant that as a good Prince once
said the People committed to his Charge may sleep more safely and
tis not to be conceivd how such a Person who is loaded continually
with foggy Intemperance can be Careful Active Watchful Alert
Thoughtful Foreseeing being all Qualities necessary for so great a
Charge

His Grace governs his Family abroad like a wise Master with good Order
and Method every thing about him shines with a temperate Use and a
daily chearful Plenty not only for his own Domesticks but for many
others but then all this is in due time and season He has no
Constitution for an Intemperate Life and the Loads of it would soon
destroy him


As for his great Profits in the Army let us take a view of them There
is an Author calld The Examiner who has been very diligent in
searching into His Graces Revenue But I am sure in his Perquisites
belonging to the Army he can be no Judge the Pay of a Captain General
by the Day may be known to any one I suppose tis set down in the
Present State of England as well as Master of the Ordnance and
Colonel of a Regiment of FootGuards these are all his Military
Employments and the Pay of them as much his due as the Pay of Three
Shillings and SixPence is to an Ensign The Earl of Rumney had all
these Places except CaptainGeneral he was both a LieutenantGeneral
and an Ambassador and enjoyd them a long time and yet I never heard
of any Man that envied him or found fault that he had too many Places
And tis a common thing for a great Mareschal of France to have many
more Posts and of much greater Profits

Any young Clerk who belongs to an Agent can presently show how many
Regiments of Horse Foot and Dragoons are in the Pay of Her Majesty
under the Duke and everyone there from a General to a Drummer what
their proper Pay is nor can they be deceived The Hospitals and the
Artillery are paid accordingly in an exact Method The Pay of each
particular Body is issued out to the Paymasters of the Army from the
PayMasterGeneral and the Duke touches not a Farthing but what
properly belongs to him And whereas abundance of People complain that
almost all the Money of the Nation was by the late Lord Treasurer
sent into Flanders to pay the Troops there no matter what became of
the other parts of the War This I know to be true That the mercenary
or hired Forces which are in our Pay and are the greatest part of our
Army under the Duke being most of them Danes Swiss Saxons and
Palatines all of the German kind will not march one Foot
notwithstanding all the Perswasions that any General can use no not
to save any King or Prince in the World unless they are duly paid at
the appointed times according to their first Agreement but then as
soon as you shew the Gheldt they presently Shoulder and Stalk
wheresoever you please

What the Queen is pleasd to allow the Duke for his Secret Service
because his Eyes and Ears must be in all Secret Cabinets and without
doubt his Intelligence must be very good it is not fit for me or the
Examiner to know or for ought I can judge any one else besides in
the World

The Perquisites of Safeguards and Contributions which in all Times
have belongd to Generals cant easily be valued they are according
to the Countries in which the War is carried But for all these Profits
to be ascribd to the Duke as in several Pamphlets tis evident they
are is very unreasonable because there are two other Chief Generals
besides the Prince of Savoy for the Imperialists and Count Tilly
for the States each of which will claim their Parts as well as His
Grace besides the gross of them which are given to the States
themselves and yet we hear of no Complaint or Papers printed against
them or in the least envied by any of the Nations under whom they
serve

In short tis all the Reason that a conquering General who fights our
Battels and must look the Powers of Europe in the Face as he is
distinguishd by Titles of Honour so whereever he goes he ought to be
attended with Plenty and Riches

A SeaCaptain after the Service of Nine or Ten Years is usually
Master of a very great Fortune he Sails in his Coach with rich
Liveries for his Colours and Steers from his City to his CountryHouse
unenvied and without unmerciful Remarks The honest Gentlemen in Town
calld Agents most of whom are risen from a mean Condition to be
Members of Parliament Justices of the Peace and to purchase Estates
whereever they can find out Land to be disposd of who never venturd
their Lives farther than from the PayOffice to the Tavern and yet
they make a Figure in the World with a very good Grace untouchd or
not markd by any Observator

But this has been the Fortune of the most glorious Persons to be
envied and persecuted whilst they are alive and when taken away from
us by some unlucky Accident are desird too late and lamented with a
Witness

If we observe through the whole Nation either here in this Capital
or in any other Parts of England allowing but for proportion of
Merit and Dignity we shall find more People belonging to Offices of
Docks and Yards to Offices of Stores and Victualling who have made as
good use of the Places in which they serve and with no greater Fatigue
and Danger than Figuring and Writing as the best and richest General
in Europe

When my Lord Marlborough had escapd the Wars and was returnd to
the quiet of the Country no Word was heard of him in Court or Town no
one talked of his Money or Riches or Estate but no sooner was he
again calld to the High Station in which he now Acts but Envy had
presently found him out even in the midst of Guards and Arms and ever
since has followd him close with all sorts of FalseReports to this
very time as if nothing but his most excellent Qualities and growing
Glory could make him Unfortunate

Indeed Generals tho the most accomplishd Heroes are but Men they
are not Infallible but may be mistaken as well as other Mortals they
are subject to Faults and Infirmities as well as their FellowCreatures
but then their great Services for the good of their Country ought to be
cast into the Ballance against their humane Mistakes and not only
Charity but Selfconsideration should give them very good Quarter
unless their Faults are provd to be Wilful and Contumacious

I know not how it might happen to the Duke if he should chance to
Miscarry or be beaten in a Battle God be praisd as yet he has never
been foild but then we must not suppose that he is Invincible that
Fortune will always be confind to the Pomel of his Sword But this is
certain that the French King has not been severe to any of his Great
Captains tho in their turns they have been all beaten by the Prince
of Savoy and the Duke the Prince taking one of his chief Mareschals
a Prisoner with him out of the midst of his Garison the Duke another
of them on the Banks of the Danube with the greatest part of the
Banners and Trophies of his almost captivd Army there are no Outcries
of the Common People for a Sacrifice to the Publick nor base
Reflections made on their Courage or Conduct because tis supposd in
all those fiery Ordeals of Battles a General exerts all the Faculties
and Powers of Body and Soul he puts Nature on the stretch And as my
Lord Duke at the conclusion of the great Battle of Blenheim said I
think to his Honour that he believed he had prayd more that Day than
all the Chaplains of his Army

Therefore let not People think that those Gentlemen who are calld to
fight Battles make use of those Employments in the heat of a bloody
War for Diversion or Pleasure They who have been Spectators of what
they do and what they suffer will soon be perswaded that no People
under Heaven purchase their Profits and Honours at a dearer rate

Tis a great happiness to a Nation to have a generous Race of Warlike
People who at all times are ready to venture their Lives in the
defence of it Cowardice is the highest Scandal to a Country and
exposes it to be a Prey to every Invader as well as a Scorn to their
Neighbours In all Histories of the World they who dare die for the
sake of their Country have been esteemd as a sort of Martyrs And the
People who are protected at Home in their Estates Ease Safety and
Liberties ought not to grudge them of any of their Perquisites but to
bless God for such a gallant number of Martial Brethren who drive the
War at a great distance so that we see none we do but hear of it for
tis a sad thing to behold the Ravages the Ruine the Spoils the
Devastations of those Countries which happen to be the Seats of War

When the Officers coming from Flanders after the Campaign appear
in the newest Fashions which they bring over with them with a good
Ayre and genteel Mien which is almost common to them the People who
never saw the Hardships which they undergo think them only designd
for Pleasure and Ease and their Profession to be desird above any
thing in the World besides They often hear of Fights and Sieges and
of a great many Men killd in a few Hours but because they see not the
Actions the Talk leaves but a small and transient Impression and so
in a small time is wipd off and forgotten But if they did but see
them in a Rainy Season when the whole Country about them is trod into
a Chaos and in such intolerable Marches Men and Horses dying and dead
together and the best of them glad of a bundle of Straw to lay down
their wet and weary Limbs If they did but see a Siege besides the
daily danger and expectation of Death which is common to all from the
General to the Centinel the Watches the Labours the Cares which
attend the greatest the ugly Sights the Stinks of Mortality the
Grass all witherd and black with the Smoke of Powder the horrid
Noises all Night and all Day and Spoil and Destruction on every side
I am sure they would be perswaded that a State of War to those who
are engagd in it must needs be a state of Labour and Misery and
that a great General I mean such a one as the Duke of Marlborough
weak in his Constitution and well stricken in Years would not undergo
those eating Cares which must be continually at his Heart the Toils
and Hardships which he must endure and the often Sorrows which must
prick his Heart for ugly Accidents if he has the least Spark of humane
Commiseration I say he would not engage himself in such a Life if
not for the sake of his Queen and Country and his Honour


I come now to add a word or two of the government of the Forces under
his Care His own Example gives a particular Life to his Orders and as
no indecent Expression unbecoming unclean or unhandsome Language
ever drops from his Lips so he is imitated by the genteel part of his
Army His Camps are like a quiet and wellgovernd City and I am apt
to believe much more Mannerly Cursing and Swearing and boisterous
Words being never heard among those who are accounted good Officers
And without doubt his Army is the best Academy in the World to teach
a young Gentlemen Wit and Breeding a Sot and a Drunkard being scornd
among them

These poor Wretches that are too many of them the refuse and
offscowrings of the worst parts of our Nation after two Campaigns by
the Care of their Officers and good Order and Discipline are made
Tractable and Civil and Orderly and Sensible and Clean and have an
Ayre and a Spirit that is beyond vulgar People


The Service of GOD according to the Order of our Church is strictly
enjoind by the Dukes special Care and in all fixed Camps every Day
Morning and Evening there are Prayers and on Sundays Sermons are duly
performd with all Decency and Respect as well as in Garisons And to
be sure the GoodNature and Compassion and Charity of Officers
expressd to the poor sick and wounded Soldiers and to their Families
in Garison is more Liberal and Generous and Free than usually we
meet with in our own Country


And now then I hope my good Countrymen will not suffer themselves any
longer to be imposd on by false Reports which are cunningly spread
abroad among them against a Gentleman a Patriot who ventures his
Life every Day for their Safety and is endeavouring to the utmost of
his Power under his Most Gracious Sovereign by his Courage his
Skill and his Wisdom to bring the Common Enemy to Reason and to
procure them and our Allies an honourable and lasting Peace


Tis a thing of ill Consequence to bring a Disreputation on the good
Name of a General and to lessen his Honour is to dispirit his Army
for when the Forces under his Command have once a mean Opinion of the
Integrity and Honour and Conduct of their General they may be drawn
out and forced to Battle but never be perswaded to think of Laurels
and Victory


Tis an old Piece of Policy for an Enemy if possible to bring an
Odium on the Honour of a General against whom he is to act Thus did
Hannibal who in his moroding Marches had spared some Grounds
belonging to the Dictator Fabius not out of any respect or kindness
to his Person but to bring him into Envy and Suspicion among the
People at Rome and so twas given out by one of the Tribunes that
Hannibal and he had as it were made a Truce that the drift of
Fabius could be nothing else but to prolong the War that he might be
long in Office and have the sole Government both of City and Armies
And without doubt the French King would have been very well
satisfied if this same Aspersion which was lately spread abroad
concerning our General had taken the effect of having him laid aside
and put out of his Places A Finishd Hero does not grow up every Day
they are scarce Plants and do not thrive in every Soil He may be
easily lost but then that Loss cannot easily be repaird therefore
there is great Reason to Value and Esteem him


To conclude As our great Commander is known to the World or at least
to the greatest part of it to be Temperate Sober Careful
Couragious Politick Skilful so he is Courteous Mild Affable
Humble and Condescending to People of the meanest Condition And as
tis said of Moses the Great the Valiant CaptainGeneral of
Almighty God for an immortal Title of Honour that he was one of the
Meekest Men upon the Earth so without doubt our CaptainGeneral
John Duke of Marlborough has a great share of it

APPENDIX


Authorship of A Short Narrative


While no direct contemporary corroboration exists as evidence for
Defoes authorship a considerable number of literary mannerisms
interests and opinions appear to establish it conclusively

As Professor John Robert Moore said The Life is exceptionally
characteristic of Defoe so characteristic in fact that one can
recognize his style and manner as one would a familiar voice The
list of phrases and mannerisms which produce this effect is extensive
The insertion of qualifying or explanatory phrases The first time
that I had the Honour of seeing John Earl of Marlborough for so I
shall call him till he was created Duke  the use of sentence
paragraphs the repetition of such introductory phrases as To be
short but now to the Truth of the matter in short and to put
all this matter out of doubt and the frequent use of words such as
matter and purpose to emphasize the force and pertinence of his
arguments mark Defoes writings throughout his career The use of the
present participle construction as subject As for his Acting in
Concert with the Heroick Prince of Savoy  is one of the strongest
Arguments of his Art and Knowledge long sentences hung together with
and and qualified with subordinate clauses and a propensity for
coining words overHonored and overPaid make Defoes writing
nearly unmistakable and give it the hasty colloquial quality His
Latin quotations are off hand and rather careless

At the same time Defoe has great stylistic virtuosity He is always
direct and forceful Although he is attacking some of the most powerful
men in politics and literature in The Life there is nothing at all
deferential He includes trivial and often superfluous details which
give whatever he writes an authentic tone these details may be places
After several Marches we came to the Confines of Haynault within a
League of a small Town calld Walcourt names of people Mr
Sizar was our PayMaster General or observations twas
supposed we would have a long and a late Fatigue The same sort of
verisimilitude which deceived the readers of Memoirs of Captain
Carleton and Journal of the Plague Year supports the illusion of an
eye witness account Defoes metaphors are also distinctive While
there are no great number they are graphic often simplify and
condense an idea and join image and idea in much the same way that
seventeenthcentury conceits do Drawing on the common place the
originality and force comes from their aptness tis easie to guess
out of what Quiver this Arrow of Scandal was drawn For the most
eminent Virtues are but as so many fair Marks set up on high for
Envy to shoot at with her poysonous darts Characteristic
idiomsEngineer that stands behind the curtains the Lord knows who
and wherecan be found on every page Small touches such as an
allusion to one of Defoes favorite jokes Lord Cravens retort to de
Vere concerning his ancestry can also be identified

Furthermore the allusions to historical and Biblical figures are
consistent with Defoes lifelong usage opinions and interests Sir
Walter Raleigh and Hannibal Moses and Solomon are referred to for the
same purposes in writings from The Shortest Way with Dissenters to
Atalantis Major a typically explicit analog from The Shortest
WayMoses was a merciful meek man and from The LifeMoses 
one of the Meekest Men upon the Earth Defoe habitually commented on
the policies of military men and statesmen traced topography and
included the large features of military campaigns which could be found
in printed records Defoes opinions on drinking swearing reliance on
Providence leadership qualities gratitude and courage to mention a
few are consistent throughout his life and found in this pamphlet For
example he makes the same distinctions in types of courage in Journal
of the Plague Year the Review Robinson Crusoe Atalantis
Major and Memoirs of Captain Carleton that he does in The Life
True courage cannot proceed from what Sir Walter Raleigh finely calls
the art or philosophy of quarrel No It must be the issue of
principle

Moreover the pamphlet itself bears certain marks indicative of
Defoes hand It was published by John Baker at the BlackBoy in
PaternosterRow Defoes usual publisher for that year Had it been
published by say Tonson the immediate conclusion would be that it
was not Defoes Baker appeared to take greater care with Defoes
pamphlets than he did with some others A Defence of Dr Sacheverell
for example has fifty lines of small type to the page Six other
tracts by Defoe have titles beginning with Short or Shortest The
use of the eye witness narrator and the soldier narrator are recurring
devices which Defoe used to protect himself or his sources and to add
weight to what he was purporting to be factual

Finally Marlborough was one of Defoes heroes until at least late 
He praises him highly in Seldom Comes a Better Atalantis Major
and The Quakers Sermon It is with reluctance that Defoe is
persuaded that Marlborough must be displaced and even in the poem on
the occasion of Marlboroughs funeral his disapproval seems to be more
for the ostentatiousness and inappropriateness of the funeral than for
the man himself All in all there is scarcely a line in The Life
which does not bear Defoes fingerprints

Section   Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment  Many small donations
 to  are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all  states of the United
States  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httpwwwgutenbergorgfundraisingdonate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States  US laws alone swamp our small staff

Section   General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone  For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support

Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included  Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition
