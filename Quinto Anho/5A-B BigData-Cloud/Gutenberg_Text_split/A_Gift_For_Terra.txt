Sidenote The good Martian Samaritans rescued Johnny Love and offered
him the stars Now maybe Johnny didnt look closely enough into the
gift horses mouth but there were others who did  and found
therein the answer to life


His head hurt like blazes but he was alive and to be alive meant
fighting like hell to stay that way

That was the first thing returning consciousness told him The next was
that his helmet should have been cracked wide open when the bum landing
had wrenched the acceleration hammocks out of their suspension sockets
and heaved his suited body across the buckled conning deck It shouldve
been but it wasnt

The third thing he knew was that Ferris helmet had been smashed into a
million pieces and that Ferris was dead

Sand sifted in a cold red river through the gaping rent in the side of
the ship trying to bury him before he could stand up and get his
balance on the crazily tilted deck He shook loose with more strength
than he needed gave the rest of the muscles in his blocky body a try
and there wasnt any hurt worse than a bruise Funny Ferris was dead

He had a feeling somewhere at the edge of his brain that there was going
to be more to it than just checking his oxygen and foodconcentrate
supply and walking away from the ship A man didnt complete the first
EarthMars flight ever made smash his ship to hell and then just walk
away from it His astrogeologernavigator was dead and the planet was
dead so a man just didnt walk away

There was plenty of room for him to scramble through the yawning rip in
the buckled hullplatesjust a matter of crawling up the river of red
sand and out it was as easy as that

Then Johnny Love was on his feet again and the sand clutched at his
heavy boots as though to keep him from leaving Ferris and the ship but
it didnt and he was walking away

                                   

Even one hundred and forty million miles from the Sun the unfiltered
daylight was harsh and the reflection of it from the crimson sand hurt
his eyes The vault of the blueblack sky was too high the desert plain
was too flat and too silent and save for the thin Martian wind that
whorled delicatelyfluted traceries in the low dunes that were the only
interruption in the flatness there was no motion and the planet was
too still

Johnny Love stopped his walking Even in the lesser gravity it seemed
too great an effort to place one booted foot before the other He looked
back and the plume of stillrising smoke from the broken thing that had
been his ship was like a solid black pillar that had been hastily built
by some evil djinn

How far had he walked how long

He turned his back on the glinting speck and made his legs move again
and there was the hollow sound of laughter in his helmet Here he was
Johnny Love the first Martian and the last Using the last of the
strength in his bruised body to go forward when there was no forward
and no backward no direction at all breathing when there was no
purpose in breathing

Why not shut off the valves now

He was too tired for hysteria Men had died alone before Alone but
never without hope And here there was no hope for there was no life
and no man had ever lived where there was not life

But he had come to see and he was seeing and in the remaining hours
left to him he would see what no man had seen in a half a million years

Harrison and Janes or Lamson and Fowler would not be down for twenty
days at the inside that had been the timetable Twenty days twenty
years  he heard himself laugh again Timetable

He and Ferris first Then Harrison and Janes Then Lamson and Fowler
all at twentyday intervals If all landed safely they would use
Exploration Plan I Condition Optimum If only two crews made it down
Plan II Condition Limited And if only one made the day journey
from the orbit of Terrathat would be Plan III Condition Untenable
Return The twentyday interval idea had come from some Earthbound
swivelchair genius who had probably never even set foot in a Satellite
operations room Somebody had impressed on him when he was young that
eggcarrying was a safer mission with a multiplicity of baskets it was
common sense that if anything happened to MarsI touching down at least
it wouldnt happen to II and III at the same time

Common sense Johnny thought and he laughed again Space was not
common and it was not sensible And nobody had ever taught it the rules
men made

He kept walking seeing thinking and breathing

For a long time He fell once or twice and picked himself up again to
walk some more and then he fell a final time and did not get up Red
sand whispered over him danced lightly drifted

                                   

The flat widetracked vehicle swerved in a tight arc throwing up low
rubycolored clouds on either side Its engines throbbed a new note of
power and it scuttled in a straight line across the desert floor like a
fleck of shiny metal drawn by an unseen magnet Behind it rose a
thinning monument of greenblack smoke and between its tracks was a
wavering line of indentations in the sand already halfobliterated by
the weight of their own shallow walls But they became deeper as the
vehicle raced ahead and then at length they ended and the vehicle
halted

There was a mound of sand that the winds in their caprice would not
have made alone for they sculptured in a freer symmetry And the
childlike figures seemed to realize that at once

With quick precision they levelled the mound and found Johnny Love They
took him into their vehicle and deftly matched and replenished the
waning gas mixture in the cylindrical tanks on his back

Then they drove away with him

                                   

Ferris

Ferris was your astrogeologernavigator He died when you crashed

Harrison  Janes

Harrison and Janes are not due for nine more days But you are in no
danger

There was darkness and warmth his throat was dry and it burned It was
hard to talk and Ferris was dead Harrison and Janes were not due for
nine more days Somebody said so Nine more days and then everything
would be

Panic shook him sent blood throbbing to his head and brought
consciousness back hard His eyes opened and he was suddenly sitting
bolt upright

But Lamson you were twenty days behind And the racing thought froze
solid in his fumbling brain Then there was a torrent of thoughts and
memory overran them buried them and red desert was rushing up to
engulf him He screamed and fell back with his hands clawing at his
eyes

You are in no danger You had thought our planet lifeless it was an
error We live underground John Love That is why you did not see us
or surface indications of our existence A group of us speak your
language because for eleven days we have been studying your brain and
analyzing your thoughtpatterns

Johnny was bolt upright again and now his eyes were wide and his hands
were knotted and where there had been only light and shadow before
there was full sight now Swiftly he was off the low cot and on his feet
looking for the speaker arms ready to lash out and hit

But he was alone in the small sterilelooking chamber and his muscles
were so much excess baggage He tried to recover his balance he had
forgotten about the slight gravity He tried too hard and his body
crashed confused into a wall Adamn them a padded wall

He regained his feet Stood still and raced his eyes about him There
it wasabove the cot A small round shuttered openingsome sort of
twoway communication system He wondered if they could see him too If
they could that part of it worked only one way

All right whoever you are so youve analyzed me He had to direct
his sudden anger at something so he shouted at the shuttered aperture
Now what

There was silence for a tiny eternity and he could feel them probing
evaluating him as a human scientist would study a rare species in a
cage The feeling ignited a new anger in him and made him want to curse
the teachings that had conditioned his lifetime of thinking to the
belief that Man was more than an animal

Hed been sold short

Damn you God damn you what are you going to do to me

In a corner of his mind he was aware of a gentle hissing sound but he
did not listen The fear and terror had to be broken Make them tell
make them tell

His muscles grew heavy and his face was feverish with his effort and
his eyes stung Something  like roses But there were no roses on
dead planets

Earthman can you still hear

I can hear Johnny said It was suddenly easier to talk Even easier
to understand They had done something

We are surprised that your state of shock was not more severe In the
process of analyzing you we discovered that you were totally unprepared
for Spaceflight and therefore

Unprepared What do you think all those months of physical conditioning
were for Yeah and all those damned textbooks You think that barrel I
cracked up was built in a Kindergarten class

Spaceflight requires but a relative minimum of those things Earthman
Required most is psychological and philosophical conditioning

To what

To all things unreal Because they are the most real infinity applies
to probability and possibility far more directly than to simple Space
and Time Butare you calm now The voice was growing deeper and
seemed almost friendly Johnny tried his muscles they werent
paralyzedhe could move easily and his head was clear And there was
no anger now No shock

Go ahead he said

Our examination of you has indicated that your race is a potentially
effective one with a superior survival factor We feel that properly
instructed and assisted such a race might be of great value as a friend
and ally In short we receive you in peace and friendship Earthman
Will you accept us in like manner

Johnny tried to think Hard thoughts the way men were supposed
to think What kind of game was it What were the strings The
angles  the gimmicks What did they really want

His lips were dry and barely moved over his teeth but the words came
easily Who says youre a friend

We would have learned as much about you by examining your corpse
Earthman

So he was alive and that had to prove something And it might have been
a lot of trouble to keep him that way The hell of it was you couldnt
know  Anything  you couldnt know anything when you were
tossed into the middle of the impossible He felt the skin on the back
of his neck chill and tighten

But who held out their hand like this

Whoever did anything like that

No

We wish to help you Earthman and your race We have observed your
kind at close quarters yet we have never landed among you nor attempted
communication because of fear for ourselves But with proper help there
need be no fear between us We offer you friendship and progress

You keep talking about what we get out of it Johnny stared upward
at the ceiling got his eyes off the little shuttered aperture He
wished he had a cigarette You sound too damned much like a
politician

Perhaps at this point you should be informed that your ship is
completely repaired and ready for your return to Earth whenever you
desire

So itsYou said Harrison and Janis would be here in nine days That
means Ive been out for nearly two weeks For a nap thats a long time
but nobody could get that bucket back in one piece in eleven days Not
after what I did to it

Your ship is completely repaired Earthman

Johnny knew somehow that the voice wasnt lying So maybe when you got
off of Earth miracles did happen He just didnt know enough

We wish to give you data to take back to your Earth which will banish
disease for youall disease Data which will give you spacecraft that
match our own in technical perfection Data that will make you the
undisputed masters of your environment We offer you the stars
Earthman

He shut a thousand racing thoughts out of his head Maybe Ill believe
this fairy tale of yours on one condition Johnny said because I
cant intelligently do otherwise

And thatcondition

Tell me why

There was a pause and it was as though something forever unknowable to
men hung in the silence

Picture if you can Earthman the answer came at last several small
islands in the center of a great sea all without life save two The
men on one have learned to build boats which can successfully sail the
sea within certain limitsthey can visit the other islands but are too
frail and too limited in power to venture past the horizon It is
infinitely frustrating to them The only places to which they may go are
dead places Save for oneonly one and it becomes magnified in
importanceit becomes an entire raison detre in itself For without
it the men with the boats sail uselessly

We are old Earthman We have watched youwaited for you for a long
time And now you have grown up You have burst your tiny bubble of
human experience You have set out upon the sea yourselves

You guys should give graduation talks I didnt ask for a scaleddown
philosophy You tell me that you want to give us every trick in your
hatfor free no questions asked So I asked why And the question
isnt changing any

The answer should be selfevident Earthman We are old And we are
lonely

                                   

There was a logic at work somewhere in his brain even during the dream
It told him that he was exhausted from the days tour with the
childlike men of Mars and that the dream was only the vagaries of a
reeling tired mind of a badly jarred subconscious It told him that the
things he had seen had been too alien for his relatively inflexible
adult Earth mind to accept without painful reaction and this was the
reaction

This the dream That was all it was his logic said so

Faith spread out before the undisciplined eye of his dreaming brain and
the nearconscious instant of logic faded The fertile plains that once
had been yellow desertland mounted golden fruits to a temperate sun
and beyond the distant green of gentlyrolling hills spread the
resplendent city and there were other cities as gracefully civilized
beyond the untroubled horizon

And in the dream these were all things men had done as though sanity
had invaded their minds overnight It was the Earth that men had
intended rather than that which they had built

The sun dimmed The air chilled and the grains and fruits wilted and
the rolling hills were a darker hue than green as the shadow lengthened
spread to the gleaming cities beyond and then as it touched them and ran
soundlessly the length and breadth of their wide malls there were other
changes

Skeletons reaching upward to a puffy leaden sky

The horizon split into jagged broken moats of dark flame and Earth was
no longer what men had built but what they eternally feared they must
one day create

Then Johnny Love was suddenly awake bolt upright in his cot and his eyes
were open wide His muscles were taut and cramped And he was afraid
although the men of Mars had offered friendship and told him that there
was nothing for him to fear

Slowly he lay down again And gradually the cold perspiration that had
encased him vanished his body relaxed and the fear subsided

The days tour had been exhausting both mentally and physically and
there was the excitement of knowing that in five more days Harrison and
Janes would land If they did not his own ship would carry him safely
back to Earth on the day following for the little men had miraculously
repaired it they had shown him They had shown him and he wanted to go
home

Johnny Love rolled over on the wide soft cot sighed and went back to
sleep

                                   

He sleeps again Andruul

Yes but the damage is probably done

No or he would not sleep again so easily His kind do not have such
emotional control

The two turned away from the fading transparency of the sleepingroom
wall and their short thin bodies were in incongruous contrast to the
spaciousness of the metalsheathed corridor down which they walked

Psychoanalysis showed up the difference in his brain structurethat
apparently accounts for the poor efficiency our screens are showing
What does Kaarn say

He says we should never have allowed the theft

Andruul cursed Allowed it Those nomadic scum are like flies No
matter how many you exterminate they never fail to come back in double
their number And they strike at the precise moment you are certain the
bones of the last one are sinking beneath the sand Somehow Central
Patrol has got to get that unit back

Youre certain it was a theft then

Dont be an idiot Since when can those gypsies build anything more
complex than a crude electrical generator Let alone a psibeam unit
Theyve forgotten what little their civilization ever knew

They are clever enough at evading directed oversurface missiles

Andruul muttered something and lapsed into silence

Well there is one thing for certain at any rate A psibeam unit is
unaccounted for and despite our protective screening the Earthman was
visibly disturbed in his sleep His encephalotapes show that clearly
They know about him Andruul and theyre making their bid Central
Patrol had better be quick and certain this time

Andruul kept his silence But he thought He thought Central Patrol was
getting less efficient and more stupid every day

                                   

It was a strange feeling a feeling with which no human was emotionally
equipped to deal

Johnny looked at his flawlessly renovated ship poised like a snubnosed
bullet against the blueblack brittleness of the Martian sky and then
looked behind him at the crescentshaped formation of tracked vehicles
that had escorted him back across the sucking red sand to this place
With each heavybooted step away from them he closed the short distance
between them and his ship and there was not enough time to think about
the feeling Or about the heavy sealed tube they had given him to take
back to his people

Usually when a man ventured beyond the bounds of familiar existence
there was conflict Either a struggle to win or immediately
recognizable success with no struggle or hint of conflict at all

But not this Not this success that seemedwhat was the word
Hostile That was ridiculous These people were friendly But
somehowthere was an empty ring

Hell They had saved his life Rebuilt his ship Given him the tube that
contained transcriptions in his own language of every scientific
secret his people could ever hope to learn for themselves in the next
thousand years And they had even buried Ferris

Use the brains of a mature man Johnny Love Youve pulled it off
without even trying The most stupendous thing any man in any age has
ever pulled off  without even trying For Gods sake dont
questiondont question things you dont understand Take the credit
and let the soulsearching go

He looked behind him again They were still there A special smiling
farewell escort watching a single solitary figure cross a short
expanse of sand to a towering glistening thing of power

He raised a booted foot to the bottom finstep hauled himself up by the
stern mounting rungs hammered the outer lock stud with his gloved fist
and the hatch swung open Like a trap

He could feel the skin at the back of his neck tighten but he forced
himself to ignore it The lock cycled up to thirteen psi and the inner
port swung automatically inward and then he was inside clambering up
the narrow ladder past the titanium alloy fuel tanks and the spidery
catwalks between them to the tiny control room in the forehull

He would not be waiting for Harrison and Janes He would get the hell
out of here and then radio them and let them make all the decisions from
there Earth for him Home He ached for it

He strapped himself in the hammock punched the warming studs for each
engine and there was a dull muffled throb below him as each jumped
into subdued life The banks of dials that curved in front of him glowed
softly and he started an almost automatic blastoff check It took
twelve precious minutes

Then he was ready Scanners on heat up  ready

The Martian sky was like frozen ink above him and his hands were wet
inside his gloves and there was a choking dryness in his throat
Now

And he could not move There was a sudden awful nausea and his head
spun and before his eyes there spread a bleeding Earth the sun dimmed
and fertile plains were cast in sudden shadow The air chilled the
shadow spread and there were skeletons reaching upward to a puffy
leaden sky

And Earth was no longer what Men had built

Then the horror in his head was gone and he felt an awful pressure on
each side of it His hands  he had been pressing with insane strength
at both sides of his skull as if to crush it with his bare hands His
face was wet and he was breathing choking in strangling gulps

A scanner alarm clanged

He forced his eyes to focus on the center screen

Earthman Emergency There has been a flaw discovered in the repair of
your ship Do not blast off Do not

The other image caught him as his arm was in midflight toward the
control bank Sweet and warm  the fertile plains mounting their
golden fruits to a mellowed sun and beyond the distant gentlyrolling
hills spread the resplendent city and there were other cities

But his arm kept going its muscles loose and it fell Heavily
Squarely on the studcomplex toward which its fist had been aimed a
splitsecond before

The engines roared and the ship lurched upward from the red sand

                                   

The command flicked into the Captains brain like a lash of ice

Slaazar Converge sheaf

Converging sir It would be no use of course If the high brass
had been content to rely on the beams rather than on their own subtlety
in the first place the Earthman would never have fallen prey to the
Nomads even for a second But they had wanted to be as forthright as
possibleforce they said would only arouse suspicion Psibeam units
only as a last resort The lowliest Patrol Lancer could have told
them the folly of that

Hastily Slaazar issued orders to his battery crews tracking the
ascending Spaceship their units already nearing overload potential But
the desertscum would see some real psipower now Theyd see it wasted
completely if they saw it at all Because theyd outmaneuvered the
brass again

Convergence impossible sir

As he had expected

Colonel Truul this is Captain Slaazar Target has passed critical
planetary curvature Convergence impossible Standing by sir

For several moments after that the thin atmosphere of Mars was warmed
a little

                                   

Acceleration blackout had not been total leaving Mars was even easier
than leaving the surface of Earth for the orbits of the Stations But
there was a period of nothought notime nobeing And then full
consciousness seeped back slowly But not as it was supposed to

Johnny Love knew he had come to because he could see the banked
instruments glowing palely before him because he could realize from
reading them that his ship was doing its job to perfection Almost ready
to complete the blastoff ogee and

Angrily he belted the scanner switches off and the dull red sphere faded
from the viewplates

And he could feel the sweat start again all over his body No the
returning consciousness was all wrong All wrong and the image
wouldnt go away

Red desert he had seen before yet had not seen There were dark ridges
of browngreen at its horizon oddlyformed craterplaces that might
once have held placid lakes And on all the vast surface there was no
hint of the Patrol tracks no sign ofanything

But he had to descend to the place

He did not know how to locate it but the image told him that it did not
matter The image said merely that he must begin cutting his power

There was no strength in his arms and hands yet they moved in front of
him as though things detached from his body skillfully surely playing
deftly across the colored studs

Scanners on Scanners on kid

He watched the screens again unconscious of what his fingers did on the
panels The dull red sphere loomed large once more The picture was
offcenter without knowing what he did he rectified course with the bow
jets it was centered again But it was a different place Still the
desert but with ridges of browngreen at its horizon oddlyformed
craterplaces

It was coming up fast now faster until the horizon was only a gentle
arc against a thin span of blackness and the rest was cold red

Hardly knowing what he did his fingers suddenly raced over the control
console even before the scanneralarms began their earsplitting
clanging

The ship lurched into a directionchange that threatened to wrench the
hull apart and the picture in the scanner reeled crazily He knew his
own brain was not dictating the commands of control to his fingertips
nor was it evaluating for itself the madly fluctuating values indicated
on the panels A human brain could not have done it he knew that

He had cut power At least there was no power He was falling at a crazy
angle and the desert was rushing up now hurtling up to smash him
Theyd hit him then yet hed felt nothing

It was getting hot His hull must be glowing now even in the thin
atmosphere of Marsit was a long fall Slower than a fall on Earth
through thinner air layers yet he was glowing like a torch

The ocean of sand rushed up

And suddenly his left hand rammed the fullpower stud

It was as though hed been hit from behind with all the brute force of
some gigantic fist and there were two things There was the
splitsecond glimpse of a crescent formation suddenly wheeling toward
him and there was the clang of the scanneralarm There were those two
things his brain registered before the titanic force of full power
squeezed consciousness from it and left him helpless

                                   

He was running In a nightmare of a dead planet that was not dead he
ran away from something

That was how his consciousness returned While he ran He stopped
stumbling turned to look behind him

And the ship was there Landed perfectly stubby bulletnose pointing to
the sky And above it

Run

The command hit his brain with almost physical force A will that was
not his own took hold of his whole being and he was running again
plowing his way through the sucking sand with strength summoned from a
well of energy within his body that had never been there before

Through the thin glassite walls of his helmet he could hear the thuk
thuk thuk of his boots as they pounded somewhere below him and there
was another pounding a deadly rhythmic bursting pressure in his chest
And a whine in his ears

The windstrewn sand stretched flat and infinitely before him Then
leaped at him headlong and there was no horizon there was only the
sudden awful wrench of concussion a tremor of pure sound which would
in denser atmosphere have destroyed him with the inertia of his own
body

He could not move Only cling to the shifting desert floor that rocked
sickeningly beneath his outstretched body  cling to it for dear life

There was no thought no understanding Only a sensation which he could
not comprehend and the sure knowledge that none of this was real Not
real but the end of survival nonetheless

                                   

Pain and seeing two bright objects transiting the darkness at which he
looked seeing something then between

His brain began identifying The darkness sky The bright objects
Diemos Phobos And the something between

It was a transparency of some sort curved or he would not have been
able to detect it at all A vaulted ceiling through which he could
see

His full consciousness came flooding back then He tried the muscles
in his neck they hurt but they worked and he could move his head from
side to side There was the same transparency as though he were covered
by some huge invisible bowl

And there were men Big muscular creatures yet thin tall Not like
the others at all

He sat bolt upright and they did not move It was not the same as
before No small room No voice that he could not see They had not even
removed his suit or his helmet and he was lying on a hard cold
substance

Then he saw what they were doing There were two of them apart from the
others working to bring a compactlooking machine into position near
him A gleaming short cylinder swung on gymbals between slender forks
mounted on a thin wheeled standard They were aiming it at him

No No He tried to get to his knees but it was as though there
were no muscles in his body

Man ofEarth We are friendly Is that understood

The thoughtwords formed in his brain as the strange images had before
and then he knew Should have guessed it part of his mind was telling
him in a fantastically detached way the dreams  the compulsions
over which he had had no control in the ship Thisthing It
probably

You are quite astute Earthman But it is not our technology which
created this device To save you and the civilization which you
representand ultimately our ownit was necessary for us to steal it
It cost six lives

Steal

From your former captors It is their invention as are so many things
with which they destroy With this instrument they have succeeded in
taking one of Natures more subtle phenomenonpsychokinesisand
amplifying its energies nearly a millionfold Those steppedup energies
can then be projected in a tight or fanned beam at will

They can make a man dream as you didor they can destroy him
outright depending on which of the psi factors ESP or PK is given
dominance during projection But we are not skilled in its
operationthey detected our use of it on you while you slept and from
that moment on you were so well screened that even at the risk of
burning this unit out we were not able to project powerfully enough to
do more than merely touch your brain

                                   

There was a strange calm in his mind now He understood the words
and accepted them as matteroffactly as they were given Even now
they were manipulating him like some intangible puppet yet he was
convinced it was not a malevolent manipulation Convinced The
convictionmanipulation too

Only partly Earthman We said we are friendly and we are We have
calmed you and erased your fear From this point on we will use this
instrument only for communication

And then he felt the fear in him again gnawing and his body was again
damp and cold But he had control now Control enough to speak

They stood before him immobile watching

Somewhere Johnny Love found his voice

Look Ive been through this friendly act before He hesitated
and they did not try to interrupt him Well dont just stand there
The fear was suddenly turning to the bitter anger of frustration they
had him whipped and he was tired Tell me why You stick that thing
into my head when Im blasting for home You force me to drop back You
blow up my ship Real friendly Real sports For a moment he had run
out of words and again they made no effort to answer him All right I
dont understand youI dont know what you want But nobody is trying
to hurt you nobodys after your little desert paradise We had an idea
thats all We thought we could make it work People have been talking
go to Mars on my planet for longer than most of em can remember So
we finally gave it a whirl Sorry

He looked at them hard then and thought that there was something
almost like a smile on the face of one Smile then damn you

We want nothing Earthman but to prevent from happening on your planet
the thing that happened on this If they succeed in destroying you as
they have us then this System will always be under their heel and we
shall never be rid of them Understand their numbers were too few ever
to conquer a planet with a civilization as large and as highly organized
as that of Earth by physical means

Knowing that wethey call us gypsies nomads desertscum todaywe
were not too alarmed when they landed here two centuries ago We were
glad to take from them without paying a price We were awed by their
gifts Their papers and their books which would show us how to rebuild
our waning civilizationadvance us a thousand years in less than fifty
restore to us our lost arts And compared to you we were so very
few

In return they said that all they wanted was permission to set up a
research site They told us they were a scientific expedition from far
outSystem Aldeberan they said Part of a vast exploratory program
which they had been conducting for centuries

We believed themwhy not One day we thought we too will be in
Space And with that day would begin one of the greatest projects of
exploration that our race had ever known So we agreed and gladly

Hold it hold it Theywho the hell are they You can spare the
suspense

And then there was no more words The pictures formed in his mind as
before only stronger now and there were no details left out

The weapons of war had been built not by the outSystem men but by
their hosts The plans had not proven too difficult to follow

The new knowledge was not hoarded was not held under jealous guard by
those who had given it but by those to whom it had been given One man
from another one group of men from another States and nations from
each other

Until there was no trust left on all the planet

There were the wars then

And when they were over the new masters had established their first
beachhead in the new System

But it was only a beachhead and had been only intended as such The
pictures broke off the unspoken words resumed Your planet was the
ultimate target but at first your civilization was not adequately
advanced to fall prey to their technique Their weapon is knowledge but
the potentialities of that knowledge must be understood by a people
before it can be effectively used to destroy them

The rest must be selfevident After we destroyed ourselves they sank
their infectious hollow roots into our planet And from then
investigated your Earth from time to time  and waited

Waited because they knew you would be coming And they knew what kind
of men you would be Strong men with the light of the stars in your
eyes Yet confused weak men with the darkness of suspicion and
jealousy still in your souls Such are humans after all

That is why we stopped you Johnny Love Once your blastoff ogee had
carried you beyond the curvature of their horizon and brought you over
us our psibeam was effective and theirs were not We are sorry about
your ship Once they realize that you were under our influence and were
returning rather than taking their precious data to your people they
zeroedin with those damnable guided juggernauts

It wasnt you then You mean they

There is little that they cannot do Destruction is their forte They
could not keep us from preventing your taking their gift to your
people but they could keep that gift from falling into our handsand
they did They do not always win But they never lose

But I Johnnys thoughts raced The ship gone And Harrison and
Janes Lamson and Fowler They would be landing in a few days They

Yes the thoughts of the true Martians before him answered And they
will be given a gift for Terra as you were If your friends return
successfully to your planet with that giftthen

The thought was not completed But it did not have to be

A beachhead was one thing These scattered struggling people who had
once been masters of Mars might one day unseat it for they were not yet
beaten people and their will to survive was yet strong But beyond
that

Earth taken the System taken

There it was

There was a sudden coldness inside him now that the fact had
crystallized had become real Here was no fantasy no wild surmise

They left him in silence while he thought their psibeam turned away
now

Harrison and Janes Lamson and Fowler Had to stop them Stop them and
then somehow get home He ached for home

He thought about Ferris who had given his life for this thing

No Ferris would not be going home Ferris was dead

He signalled for the psibeam to be turned toward him again

Youd have to know their positions out there to make contact wouldnt
you They did not answer He worked to get the words formed and there
was a fleeting thought of a green lush planet far away its wide
streets and rolling fields bathed in warm sunlight I can figure em
he said I know blastoff schedules speeds I know the works Those
things they had in the books Then you guys can do the rest withthat
thing Right

They answered him then

Thank you they said And that was all

                                   

Answer me the General barked again You Janes Lamson
FowlerHarrison For the last time what happened out there

The four stood silently before the nervous figure of their commander
and it was Fowler who finally spoke

Plan III sir as weve already said Condition UntenableReturn

That is all you can say

That isall sir

The General turned away There was frustration and anger in his face
and it hid the fear beneath it like a mask Plan III It would be Plan
III for a long time yet

It was the thing he saw in the faces of the four men that told him that
There had been too many giant steps too fast He had seen this thing in
the faces of men before but never so nakedly

One day perhaps men could think of Plan I again One day but not now

He turned back to the four and looked once more into their faces

Plan III Condition Untenable

Dismissed the General said
