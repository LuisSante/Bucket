CHAPTER I

BETH RECEIVES AN INVITATION


Professor De Graf was sorting the mail at the breakfast table

Heres a letter for you Beth said he and tossed it across the
cloth to where his daughter sat

The girl raised her eyebrows expressing surprise It was something
unusual for her to receive a letter She picked up the square envelope
between a finger and thumb and carefully read the inscription Miss
Elizabeth De Graf Cloverton Ohio Turning the envelope she found on
the reverse flap a curious armorial emblem with the word Elmhurst

Then she glanced at her father her eyes big and somewhat startled
in expression The Professor was deeply engrossed in a letter from
Benjamin Lowenstein which declared that a certain note must be paid at
maturity His weak watery blue eyes stared rather blankly from behind
the goldrimmed spectacles His flat nostrils extended and compressed
like those of a frightened horse and the indecisive mouth was
tremulous At the best the Professor was not an imposing personage
He wore a dressinggown of soiled quilted silk and linen not too
immaculate but his little sandy moustache and the goatee that
decorated his receding chin were both carefully waxed into sharp
pointsan indication that he possessed at least one vanity Three
days in the week he taught vocal and instrumental music to the
ambitious young ladies of Cloverton The other three days he rode to
Pelhams Grove ten miles away and taught music to all who wished to
acquire that desirable accomplishment But the towns were small and
the fees not large so that Professor De Graf had much difficulty in
securing an income sufficient for the needs of his family

The stout sourvisaged lady who was halfhidden by her newspaper at
the other end of the table was also a breadwinner for she taught
embroidery to the women of her acquaintance and made various articles
of fancywork that were sold at Biggars Emporium the largest store
in Cloverton So between them the Professor and Mrs DeGraf managed
to defray ordinary expenses and keep Elizabeth at school but there
were one or two dreadful notes that were constantly hanging over
their heads like the sword of Damocles threatening to ruin them at
any moment their creditors proved obdurate

Finding her father and mother both occupied the girl ventured to open
her letter It was written in a sharp angular feminine hand and read
as follows

My Dear Niece It will please me to have you spend the months of July
and August as my guest at Elmhurst I am in miserable health and
wish to become better acquainted with you before I die A check for
necessary expenses is enclosed and I shall expect you to arrive
promptly on the first of July

Your Aunt

JANE MERRICK

A low exclamation from Elizabeth caused her father to look in her
direction He saw the bank check lying beside her plate and the sight
lent an eager thrill to his voice

What is it Beth

A letter from Aunt Jane

Mrs De Graf gave a jump and crushed the newspaper into her lap

What she screamed

Aunt Jane has invited me to spend two months at Elmhurst said
Elizabeth and passed the letter to her mother who grabbed it
excitedly

How big is the check Beth enquired the Professor in a low tone

A hundred dollars She says its for my expenses

Huh Of course you wont go near that dreadful old cat so we can use
the money to better advantage

Adolph

The harsh cutting voice was that of his wife and the Professor
shrank back in his chair

Your sister Jane is a mean selfish despicable old female he
muttered Youve said so a thousand times yourself Julia

My sister Jane is a very wealthy woman and shes a Merrick
returned the lady severely How dare youa common De Grafasperse
her character

The De Grafs are a very good family he retorted

Show me one who is wealthy Show me one who is famous

I cant said the Professor But theyre decent and theyre
generous which is more than can be said for your tribe

Elizabeth must go to Elmhurst said Mrs De Graf ignoring her
husbands taunt

She shant Your sister refused to loan me fifty dollars last year
when I was in great trouble She hasnt given you a single cent since
I married you No daughter of mine shall go In Elmhurst to be bullied
and insulted by Jane Merrick

Adolph try to conceal the fact that youre a fool said his wife
Jane is in a desperate state of health and cant live very long at
the best I believe shes decided to leave her money to Elizabeth or
she never would have invited the child to visit her Do you want to
fly in the face of Providence you doddering old imbecile

No said the Professor accepting the doubtful appellation without a
blush How much do you suppose Jane is worth

A half million at the very least When she was a girl she inherited
from Thomas Bradley the man she was engaged to marry and who was
suddenly killed in a railway accident more than a quarter of a
million dollars besides that beautiful estate of Elmhurst I dont
believe Jane has even spent a quarter of her income and the fortune
must have increased enormously Elizabeth will be one of the
wealthiest heiresses in the country

If she gets the money which I doubt returned the Professor
gloomily

Why should you doubt it after this letter

You had another sister and a brother and they both had children
said he

They each left a girl I admit But Jane has never favored them
any more than she has me And this invitation coming when Jane is
practically on her death bed is a warrant that Beth will get the
money

I hope she will sighed the music teacher We all need it bad
enough Im sure

During this conversation Elizabeth who might be supposed the one most
interested in her Aunts invitation sat silently at her place eating
her breakfast with her accustomed calmness of demeanor and scarcely
glancing at her parents

She had pleasant and quite regular features for a girl of fifteen
with dark hair and eyesthe Merrick eyes her mother proudly
declaredand a complexion denoting perfect health and colored with
the rosy tints of youth Her figure was a bit slim and unformed
and her shoulders stooped a little more than was desirable but in
Cloverton Elizabeth had the reputation of being a pretty girl and a
sullen and unresponsive one as well

Presently she rose from her seat glanced at the clock and then went
into the hall to get her hat and schoolbooks The prospect of being
an heiress some day had no present bearing on the fact that it was
time to start for school

Her father came to the door with the check in his hand

Just sign your name on the back of this Beth said he and Ill
get it cashed for you

The girl shook her head

No father she answered If I decide to go to Aunt Janes I must
buy some clothes and if you get the money Ill never see a cent of
it

When will you decide he asked

Theres no hurry Ill take time to think it over she replied I
hate Aunt Jane of course so if I go to her I must be a hypocrite
and pretend to like her or she never will leave me her property

Well Beth

Perhaps it will be worth while but if I go into that womans house
Ill be acting a living lie

But think of the money said her mother

I do think of it Thats why I didnt tell you at once to send the
check back to Aunt Jane Im going to think of everything before I
decide But if I goif I allow this money to make me a hypocriteI
wont stop at trifles I assure you Its in my nature to be
dreadfully wicked and cruel and selfish and perhaps the money isnt
worth the risk I run of becoming depraved

Elizabeth

Goodbye Im late now she continued in the same quiet tone and
walked slowly down the walk

The Professor twisted his moustache and looked into his wifes eyes
with a half frightened glance

Beths a mighty queer girl he muttered

Shes very like her Aunt Jane returned Mrs De Graf thoughtfully
gazing after her daughter But shes defiant and wilful enough for
all the Merricks put together I do hope shell decide to go to
Elmhurst




CHAPTER II

MOTHER AND DAUGHTER


In the cosy chamber of an apartment located in a fashionable quarter
of New York Louise Merrick reclined upon a couch dressed in a
dainty morning gown and propped and supported by a dozen embroidered
cushions

Upon a taboret beside her stood a box of bonbons the contents of
which she occasionally nibbled as she turned the pages of her novel

The girl had a pleasant and attractive face although its listless
expression was singular in one so young It led you to suspect that
the short seventeen years of her life had robbed her of all the
anticipation and eagerness that is accustomed to pulse in strong young
blood and filled her with experiences that compelled her to accept
existence in a half bored and wholly matteroffact way

The room was tastefully though somewhat elaborately furnished yet
everything in it seemed as fresh and new as if it had just come from
the shopwhich was not far from the truth The apartment itself
was new with highly polished floors and woodwork and decorations
undimmed by time Even the girls robe which she wore so gracefully
was new and the books upon the centertable were of the latest
editions

The portiere was thrust aside and an elderly lady entered the room
seating herself quietly at the window and after a single glance at
the form upon the couch beginning to embroider patiently upon some
work she took from a silken bag She moved so noiselessly that the
girl did not hear her and for several minutes absolute silence
pervaded the room

Then however Louise in turning a leaf glanced up and saw the head
bent over the embroidery She laid down her book and drew an open
letter from between the cushions beside her which she languidly
tossed into the others lap

Who is this woman mamma she asked

Mrs Merrick glanced at the letter and then read it carefully through
before replying

Jane Merrick is your fathers sister she said at last as she
thoughtfully folded the letter and placed it upon the table

Why have I never heard of her before enquired the girl with a
slight accession of interest in her tones

That I cannot well explain I had supposed you knew of your poor
fathers sister Jane although you were so young when he died that it
is possible he never mentioned her name in your presence

They were not on friendly terms you know Jane was rich having
inherited a fortune and a handsome country place from a young man whom
she was engaged to marry but who died on the eve of his wedding day

How romantic exclaimed Louise

It does seem romantic related in this way replied her mother But
with the inheritance all romance disappeared from your aunts life
She became a crabbed disagreeable woman old before her time and
friendless because she suspected everyone of trying to rob her of her
money Your poor father applied to her in vain for assistance and I
believe her refusal positively shortened his life When he died after
struggling bravely to succeed in his business he left nothing but his
lifeinsurance

Thank heaven he left that sighed Louise

Yes we would have been beggared indeed without it agreed Mrs
Merrick Yet I often wonder Louise how we managed to live upon the
interest of that money for so many years

We didnt livewe existed corrected the girl yawning We
scrimped and pinched and denied ourselves everything but bare
necessities And had it not been for your brilliant idea mater dear
we would still be struggling in the depths of poverty

Mrs Merrick frowned and leaned back in her chair

I sometimes doubt if the idea was so brilliant after all she
returned with a certain grimness of expression Were plunging
Louise and it may be into a bottomless pit

Dont worry dear said the girl biting into a bonbon We are
only on the verge of our great adventure and theres no reason to
be discouraged yet I assure you Brilliant Of course the idea
was brilliant mamma The income of that insurance money was
insignificant but the capital is a very respectable sum I am just
seventeen years of agealthough I feel that I ought to be thirty at
the leastand in three years I shall be twenty and a married woman
You decided to divide our capital into three equal parts and spend a
third of it each year this plan enabling us to live in good style and
to acquire a certain social standing that will allow me to select a
wealthy husband Its a very brilliant idea my dear Three years is a
long time Ill find my Croesus long before that never fear

You ought to returned the mother thoughtfully But if you fail
we shall be entirely ruined

A strong incentive to succeed said Louise smiling An ordinary
girl might not win out but Ive had my taste of poverty and I dont
like it No one will suspect us of being adventurers for as long as
we live in this luxurious fashion we shall pay our bills promptly and
be proper and respectable in every way The only chance we run lies in
the danger that eligible young men may prove shy and refuse to take
our bait but are we not diplomats mother dear We wont despise a
millionaire but will be content with a man who can support us in good
style or even in comfort and in return for his money Ill be a very
good wife to him That seems sensible and wise Im sure and not at
all difficult of accomplishment

Mrs Merrick stared silently out of the window and for a few moments
seemed lost in thought

I think Louise she said at last you will do well to cultivate
your rich aunt and so have two strings to your bow

You mean that I should accept her queer invitation to visit her

Yes

She has sent me a check for a hundred dollars Isnt it funny

Jane was always a whimsical woman Perhaps she thinks we are quite
destitute and fears you would not be able to present a respectable
appearance at Elmhurst without this assistance But it is an evidence
of her good intentions Finding death near at hand she is obliged to
select an heir and so invites you to visit her that she may study
your character and determine whether you are worthy to inherit her
fortune

The girl laughed lightly

It will be easy to cajole the old lady she said In two days I can
so win her heart that she will regret she has neglected me so long

Exactly

If I get her money we will change our plans and abandon the
adventure we were forced to undertake But if for any reason that
plan goes awry we can fall back upon this prettily conceived scheme
which we have undertaken As you say it is well to have two strings
to ones bow and during July and August everyone will be out of town
and so we shall lose no valuable time

Mrs Merrick did not reply She stitched away in a methodical manner
as if abstracted and Louise crossed her delicate hands behind her
head and gazed at her mother reflectively Presently she said

Tell me more of my fathers family Is this rich aunt of mine the
only relative he had

No indeed There were two other sisters and a brothera very
uninteresting lot with the exception of your poor father The eldest
was John Merrick a common tinsmith if I remember rightly who went
into the far west many years ago and probably died there for he was
never heard from Then came Jane who in her young days had some
slight claim to beauty Anyway she won the heart of Thomas Bradley
the wealthy young man I referred to and she must have been clever to
have induced him to leave her his money Your father was a year or so
younger than Jane and after him came Julia a coarse and
disagreeable creature who married a musicteacher and settled in some
outoftheway country town Once while your father was alive she
visited us for a few days with her baby daughter and nearly drove us
all crazy Perhaps she did not find us very hospitable for we were
too poor to entertain lavishly Anyway she went away suddenly after
you had a fight with her child and nearly pulled its hair out by the
roots and I have never heard of her since

A daughter eh said Louise musingly Then this rich Aunt Jane has
another niece besides myself

Perhaps two returned Mrs Merrick for her youngest sister who
was named Violet married a vagabond Irishman and had a daughter
about a year younger than you The mother died but whether the child
survived her or not I have never learned

What was her name asked Louise

I cannot remember But it is unimportant You are the only Merrick of
them all and that is doubtless the reason Jane has sent for you

The girl shook her blonde head

I dont like it she observed

Dont like what

All this string of relations It complicates matters

Mrs Merrick seemed annoyed

If you fear your own persuasive powers she said with almost a
sneer in her tones youd better not go to Elmhurst One or the
other of your country cousins might supplant you in your dear aunts
affections

The girl yawned and took up her neglected novel

Nevertheless mater dear she said briefly I shall go




CHAPTER III

PATSY


Now Major stand up straight and behave yourself How do you expect
me to sponge your vest when youre wriggling around in that way

Patsy dear youre so sweet this evening I just had to kiss your
lips

Dont do it again sir replied Patricia severely as she scrubbed
the big mans waistcoat with a damp cloth And tell me Major how
you ever happened to get into such a disgraceful condition

The soup just shpilled said the Major meekly

Patricia laughed merrily She was a tiny thing appearing to be no
more than twelve years old although in reality she was sixteen Her
hair was a decided rednot a beautiful auburn but really redand
her round face was badly freckled Her nose was too small and her
mouth too wide to be beautiful but the girls wonderful blue eyes
fully redeemed these faults and led the observer to forget all else
but their fascinations They could really dance these eyes and send
out magnetic scintillating sparks of joy and laughter that were
potent to draw a smile from the sourest visage they smiled upon
Patricia was a favorite with all who knew her but the big
whitemoustached Major Doyle her father positively worshipped her
and let the girl rule him as her fancy dictated

Now sir youre fairly decent again she said after a few vigorous
scrubs So put on your hat and well go out to dinner

They occupied two small rooms at the top of a respectable but
middleclass tenement building and had to descend innumerable flights
of bare wooden stairs before they emerged upon a narrow street
thronged with people of all sorts and descriptions except those who
were too far removed from the atmosphere of Duggan street to know that
it existed

The big major walked stiffly and pompously along swinging his
silvertrimmed cane in one hand while Patricia clung to his other arm
The child wore a plain grey cloak for the evening was chill She had
a knack of making her own clothes all of simple material and fashion
but fitting neatly and giving her an air of quiet refinement that made
more than one passerby turn to look back at her curiously

After threading their way for several blocks they turned in at the
open door of an unobtrusive restaurant where many of the round white
tables were occupied by busy and silent patrons

The proprietor nodded to the major and gave Patricia a smile There
was no need to seat them for they found the little table in the
corner where they were accustomed to eat and sat down

Did you get paid tonight asked the girl

To be sure my Patsy

Then hand over the coin she commanded

The major obeyed She counted it carefully and placed it in her
pocketbook afterwards passing a halfdollar back to her father

Remember Major no riotous living Make that go as far as you can
and take care not to invite anyone to drink with you

Yes Patsy

And now Ill order the dinner

The waiter was bowing and smiling beside her Everyone smiled at
Patsy it seemed

They gave the usual order and then after a moments hesitation she
added

And a bottle of claret for the Major

Her father fairly gasped with amazement

Patsy

People at the nearby tables looked up as her gay laugh rang out and
beamed upon her in sympathy

Im not crazy a bit Major said she patting the hand he had
stretched toward her partly in delight and partly in protest Ive
just had a raise thats all and well celebrate the occasion

Her father tucked the napkin under his chin then looked at her
questioningly

Tell me Patsy

Madam Borne sent me to a swell house on Madison Avenue this morning
because all her women were engaged I dressed the ladys hair in
my best style Major and she said it was much more becoming than
Juliette ever made it Indeed she wrote a note to Madam asking her
to send me hereafter instead of Juliette and Madam patted my head
and said I would be a credit to her and my wages would be ten dollars
a week from now on Ten dollars Major As much as you earn yourself
at that miserable bookkeeping

Sufferin Moses ejaculated the astonished major staring back into
her twinkling eyes if this kapes on well be millionaires Patsy

Were millionaires now responded Patsy promptly because weve
health and love and contentmentand enough money to keep us from
worrying Do you know what Ive decided Major dear You shall go to
make that visit to your colonel that youve so long wanted to have
The vacation will do you good and you can get away all during July
because you havent rested for five years I went to see Mr Conover
this noon and he said hed give you the month willingly and keep the
position for you when you returned

What You spoke to old Conover about me

This noon Its all arranged daddy and youll just have a glorious
time with the old colonel Bless his dear heart hell be overjoyed to
have you with him at last

The major pulled out his handkerchief blew his nose vigorously and
then surreptitiously wiped his eyes

Ah Patsy Patsy its an angel you are and nothing less at all at
all

Rubbish Major Try your claret and see if its right And eat your
fish before it gets cold Ill not treat you again sir unless you
try to look happy Why you seem as glum as old Conover himself

The major was positively beaming

Would it look bad for me to kiss you Patsy

Now

Now and right here in this very room

Of course it would Try and behave like the gentleman you are and
pay attention to your dinner

It was a glorious meal The cost was twentyfive cents a plate but
the gods never feasted more grandly in Olympus than these two simple
loving souls in that grimy Duggan street restaurant

Over his coffee the major gave a sudden start and looked guiltily into
Patricias eyes

Now then she said quickly catching the expression out with it

Its a letter said the major It came yesterday or mayhap the day
before I dont just remember

A letter And who from she cried surprised

An ould vixen

And who may that be

Your mothers sister Jane I can tell by the emblem on the flap of
the envelope said he drawing a crumpled paper from his breast
pocket

Oh that person said Patsy with scorn Whatever induced her to
write to me You might read it and find out suggested the major

Patricia tore open the envelope and scanned the letter Her eyes
blazed

What is it Mavoureen

An insult she answered crushing the paper in her hand and then
stuffing it into the pocket of her dress Light your pipe daddy
dear HereIll strike the match




CHAPTER IV

LOUISE MAKES A DISCOVERY


How did you enjoy the reception Louise

Very well mamma But I made the discovery that my escort Harry
Wyndham is only a poor cousin of the rich Wyndham family and will
never have a penny he doesnt earn himself

I knew that said Mrs Merrick But Harry has the entree into some
very exclusive social circles I hope you treated him nicely Louise
He can be of use to us

Oh yes I think I interested him but hes a very stupid boy By the
way mamma I had an adventure last evening which I have had no time
to tell you of before

Yes

It has given me quite a shock You noticed the maid you ordered to
come from Madam Borne to dress my hair for the reception

I merely saw her Was she unsatisfactory

She was very clever I never looked prettier I am sure The maid is
a little demure thing very young for such a position and positively
homely and common in appearance But I hardly noticed her until she
dropped a letter from her clothing It fell just beside me and I saw
that it was addressed to no less a personage than my rich aunt Miss
Jane Merrick at Elmhurst Curious to know why a hairdresser should
be in correspondence with Aunt Jane I managed to conceal the letter
under my skirts until the maid was gone Then I put it away until
after the reception It was sealed and stamped all ready for the
post but I moistened the flap and easily opened it Guess what I
read

Ive no idea replied Mrs Merrick

Here it is continued Louise producing a letter and carefully
unfolding it Listen to this if you please Aunt Jane She doesnt
even say dear or respected you observe

Your letter to me asking me to visit you is almost an insult
after your years of silence and neglect and your refusals to assist
my poor mother when she was in need Thank God we can do without
your friendship and assistance now for my honored father Major
Gregory Doyle is very prosperous and earns all we need I return your
check with my compliments If you are really ill I am sorry for you
and would go to nurse you were you not able to hire twenty nurses
each of whom would have fully as much love and far more respect for
you than could ever

Your indignant niece

Patricia Doyle

What do you think of that mamma

Its very strange Louise This hairdresser is your own cousin

So it seems And she must be poor or she wouldnt go out as a sort
of ladys maid I remember scolding her severely for pulling my hair
at one time and she was as meek as Moses and never answered a word

She has a temper though as this letter proves said Mrs Merrick
and I admire her for the stand she has taken

So do I rejoined Louise with a laugh for it removes a rival from
my path You will notice that Aunt Jane has sent her a check for the
same amount she sent me Here it is folded in the letter Probably my
other cousin the De Graf girl is likewise invited to Elmhurst Aunt
Jane wanted us all to see what we were like and perhaps to choose
between us

Quite likely said Mrs Merrick uneasily watching her daughters
face

That being the case continued Louise I intend to enter the
competition With this child Patricia out of the way it will be a
simple duel with my unknown De Graf cousin for my aunts favor and
the excitement will be agreeable even if I am worsted

Theres no danger of that said her mother calmly And the stakes
are high Louise Ive learned that your Aunt Jane is rated as worth a
half million dollars

They shall be mine said the daughter with assurance Unless
indeed the De Graf girl is most wonderfully clever What is her
name

Elizabeth if I remember rightly But I am not sure she is yet alive
my dear I havent heard of the De Grafs for a dozen years

Anyway I shall accept my Aunt Janes invitation and make the
acceptance as sweet as Patricia Doyles refusal is sour Aunt Jane
will be simply furious when she gets the little hairdressers note

Will you send it on

Why not Its only a question of resealing the envelope and mailing
it And it will be sure to settle Miss Doyles chances of sharing the
inheritance for good and all

And the check

Oh I shall leave the check inside the envelope It wouldnt be at
all safe to cash it you know

But if you took it out Jane would think the girl had kept tit money
after all and would be even more incensed against her

No said Louise after a moments thought Ill not do a single act
of dishonesty that could ever by any chance be traced to my door To
be cunning to be diplomatic to play the game of life with the best
cards we can draw is every womans privilege But if I cant win
honestly mater dear Ill quit the game for even money cant
compensate a girl for the loss of her selfrespect

Mrs Merrick cast a fleeting glance at her daughter and smiled
Perhaps the heroics of Louise did not greatly impress her




CHAPTER V

AUNT JANE


Lift me up Phibbsno not that way Confound your awkwardnessdo
you want to break my back There Thats better Now the pillow at my
head Ohh What are you blinking at you old owl

Are you better this morning Miss Jane asked the attendant with
grave deference

No Im worse

You look brighter Miss Jane

Dont be stupid Martha Phibbs I know how I am better than any
doctor and I tell you Im on my last legs

Anything unusual Miss

Of course I cant be on my last legs regularly can I

I hope not Miss

What do you mean by that Are you trying to insult me now that Im
weak and helpless Answer me you gibbering idiot

Im sure youll feel better soon Miss Cant I wheel you into the
garden Its a beautiful day and quite sunny and warm already

Be quick about it then and dont tire me out with your eternal
doddering When a thing has to be done do it Thats my motto

Yes Miss Jane

Slowly and with care the old attendant wheeled her mistresss invalid
chair through the doorway of the room along a stately passage
and out upon a broad piazza at the back of the mansion Here were
extensive and carefully tended gardens and the balmy morning air was
redolent with the odor of flowers

Jane Merrick sniffed the fragrance with evident enjoyment and her
sharp grey eyes sparkled as she allowed them to roam over the gorgeous
expanse of colors spread out before her

Ill go down I guess Phibbs This may be my last day on earth
and Ill spend an hour with my flowers before I bid them goodbye
forever

Phibbs pulled a bellcord and a soft faraway jingle was heard Then
an old man came slowly around the corner of the house His bare
head was quite bald He wore a short canvas apron and carried
pruningshears in one hand Without a word of greeting to his mistress
or scarce a glance at her half recumbent form he mounted the steps of
the piazza and assisted Phibbs to lift the chair to the ground

How are the roses coming on James

Poorly Miss he answered and turning his back returned to his work
around the corner If he was surly Miss Jane seemed not to mind it
Her glance even softened a moment as she followed his retreating form

But now she was revelling amongst the flowers which she seemed to
love passionately Phibbs wheeled her slowly along the narrow paths
between the beds and she stopped frequently to fondle a blossom or
pull away a dead leaf or twig from a bush The roses were magnificent
in spite of the old gardeners croaking and the sun was warm and
grateful and the hum of the bees musical and sweet

Its hard to die and leave all this Phibbs said the old woman a
catch in her voice But its got to be done

Not for a while yet I hope Miss Jane

It wont be long Phibbs But I must try to live until my nieces
come and I can decide which of them is most worthy to care for the
old place when I am gone

Yes Miss

Ive heard from two of them already They jumped at the bait I held
out quickly enough but thats only natural And the letters are very
sensible ones too Elizabeth DeGraf says she will be glad to come
and thanks me for inviting her Louise Merrick is glad to come also
but hopes I am deceived about my health and that she will make me more
than one visit after we become friends A very proper feeling but Im
not deceived Phibbs My ends in plain sight

Yes Miss Jane

And somebodys got to have my money and dear Elmhurst when Im
through with them Who will it be Phibbs

Im sure I dont know Miss

Nor do I The moneys mine and I can do what I please with it and
Im under no obligation to anyone

Except Kenneth said a soft voice behind her

Jane Merrick gave a start at the interruption and turned red and angry
as without looking around she answered

Stuff and nonsense I know my duties and my business Silas Watson

To be sure said a little withered man passing around the chair
and facing the old woman with an humble deprecating air He was
clothed in black and his smoothshaven deeply lined face was
pleasant of expression and not without power and shrewd intelligence
The eyes however were concealed by heavyrimmed spectacles and his
manner was somewhat shy and reserved However he did not hesitate to
speak frankly to his old friend nor minded in the least if he aroused
her ire

No one knows better than you dear Miss Jane her duties and
obligations and no one performs them more religiously But your
recent acts I confess puzzle me Why should you choose from a lot
of inexperienced incompetent girls a successor to Thomas Bradleys
fortune when he especially requested you in his will to look after
any of his relatives should they need assistance Kenneth Forbes his
own nephew was born after Toms death to be sure but he is alone in
the world now an orphan and has had no advantages to help him along
in life since his mothers death eight years ago I think Tom Bradley
must have had a premonition of what was to come even though his sister
was not married at the time of his death and I am sure he would want
you to help Kenneth now

He placed me under no obligations to leave the boy any money
snapped the old woman white with suppressed wrath you know that
well enough Silas Watson for you drew up the will

The old gentleman slowly drew a pattern upon the gravelled walk with
the end of his walkingstick

Yes I drew up the will he said deliberately and I remember that
he gave to you his betrothed bride all that he possessedgave it
gladly and lovingly and without reserve He was very fond of you
Miss Jane But perhaps his conscience pricked him a bit after all
for he added the words I shall expect you to look after the welfare
of my only relative my sister Katherine Bradleyor any of her
heirs It appears to me Miss Jane that that is a distinct
obligation The boy is now sixteen and as fine a fellow as one often
meets

Bah An imbecilean awkward illmannered brat who is only fit for a
stableboy I know him Silas and I know hell never amount to a hill
of beans Leave him my money Not if I hadnt a relative on earth

You misjudge him Jane Kenneth is all right if youll treat him
decently But he wont stand your abuse and I dont think the less of
him for that

Why abuse Havent I given him a home and an education all because
Thomas asked me to look after his relatives And hes been rebellious
and pigheaded and sullen in return for my kindness so naturally
theres little love lost between us

You resented your one obligation Jane and although you fulfilled it
to the letter you did not in the spirit of Tom Bradleys request I
dont blame the boy for not liking you

Sir

All right Jane fly at me if you will said the little man with a
smile but I intend to tell you frankly what I think of your actions
just as long as we remain friends

Her stern brows unbent a trifle

Thats why we are friends Silas and its useless to quarrel with
you now that Im on my last legs A few days more will end me Im
positive so bear with me a little longer my friend

He took her withered hand in his and kissed it gently

Youre not so very bad Jane said he and Im almost sure you
will be with us for a long time to come But youre more nervous and
irritable than usual Ill admit and I fear this invasion of your
nieces wont be good for you Are they really coming

Two of them are Im sure for theyve accepted my invitation she
replied

Heres a letter that just arrived he said taking it from his
pocket Perhaps it contains news from the third niece

My glasses Phibbs cried Miss Jane eagerly and the attendant
started briskly for the house to get them

What do you know about these girls asked the old lawyer curiously

Nothing whatever I scarcely knew of their existence until you hunted
them out for me and found they were alive But Im going to know them
and study them and the one thats most capable and deserving shall
have my property

Mr Watson sighed

And Kenneth he asked

Ill provide an annuity for the boy although its more than he
deserves When I realized that death was creeping upon me I felt a
strange desire to bequeath my fortune to one of my own flesh and
blood Perhaps I didnt treat my brothers and sisters generously in
the old days Silas

Perhaps not he answered

So Ill make amends to one of their children That is if any one of
the three nieces should prove worthy

I see But if neither of the three is worthy

Then Ill leave every cent to charityexcept Kenneths annuity

The lawyer smiled

Let us hope said he that they will prove all you desire It would
break my heart Jane to see Elmhurst turned into a hospital

Phibbs arrived with the spectacles and Jane Merrick read her letter
her face growing harder with every line she mastered Then she
crumpled the paper fiercely in both hands and a moment later smoothed
it out carefully and replaced it in the envelope

Silas Watson had watched her silently

Well said he at last another acceptance

No a refusal said she A refusal from the Irishmans daughter
Patricia Doyle

Thats bad he remarked but in a tone of relief

I dont see it in that light at all replied Miss Jane The girl
is right Its the sort of letter Id have written myself under the
circumstances Ill write again Silas and humble myself and try to
get her to come

You surprise me said the lawyer

I surprise myself retorted the old woman but I mean to know more
of this Patricia Doyle Perhaps Ive found a gold mine Silas Watson




CHAPTER VI

THE BOY


Leaving the mistress of Elmhurst among her flowers Silas Watson
walked slowly and thoughtfully along the paths until he reached the
extreme left wing of the rambling old mansion Here half hidden by
tangled vines of climbing roses he came to a flight of steps leading
to an ironrailed balcony and beyond this was a narrow stairway to
the rooms in the upper part of the wing

Miss Merrick however ungenerous she might have been to others had
always maintained Elmhurst in a fairly lavish manner There were
plenty of servants to look after the house and gardens and there were
good horses in the stables Whenever her health permitted she dined in
state each evening in the great diningroom solitary and dignified
unless on rare occasions her one familiar Silas Watson occupied the
seat opposite her The boy as he was contemptuously called was
never permitted to enter this room Indeed it would be difficult to
define exactly Kenneth Forbes position at Elmhurst He had lived
there ever since his mothers death when a silent and unattractive
lad of eight Mr Watson had brought him to Jane Merrick and insisted
upon her providing a home for Tom Bradleys orphaned nephew

She accepted the obligation reluctantly enough giving the child a
small room in the left wing as far removed from her own apartments as
possible and transferring all details of his care to Misery Agnew
the old housekeeper Misery endeavored to do her duty by the boy
but appreciating the scant courtesy with which he was treated by her
mistress it is not surprising the old woman regarded him merely as a
dependent and left him mostly to his own devices

Kenneth even in his first days at Elmhurst knew that his presence
was disagreeable to Miss Jane and as the years dragged on he grew shy
and retiring longing to break away from his unpleasant surroundings
but knowing of no other place where he would be more welcome His only
real friend was the lawyer who neglected no opportunity to visit the
boy and chat with him in his cheery manner Mr Watson also arranged
with the son of the village curate to tutor Kenneth and prepare him
for college but either the tutor was incompetent or the pupil did not
apply himself for at twenty Kenneth Forbes was very ignorant indeed
and seemed not to apply himself properly to his books

He was short of stature and thin with a sad drawn face and manners
that even his staunch friend Silas Watson admitted were awkward and
unprepossessing What he might have been under different conditions or
with different treatment could only be imagined Slowly climbing the
stairs to the little room Kenneth inhabited Mr Watson was forced to
conclude with a sigh of regret that he could not blame Miss Jane
for wishing to find a more desirable heir to her estate than this
graceless sullen youth who had been thrust upon her by a thoughtless
request contained in the will of her dead lovera request that she
seemed determined to fulfil literally as it only required her to
look after Toms relatives and did not oblige her to leave Kenneth
her property

Yet strange as it may seem the old lawyer was exceedingly fond of
the boy and longed to see him the master of Elmhurst Sometimes when
they were alone Kenneth forgot his sense of injury and dependence
and spoke so well and with such animation that Mr Watson was
astonished and believed that hidden underneath the mask of reserve
was another entirely different personality that in the years to come
might change the entire nature of the neglected youth and win for him
the respect and admiration of the world But these fits of brightness
and geniality were rare Only the lawyer had as yet discovered them

Today he found the boy lying listlessly upon the windowseat an open
book in his hand but his eyes fixed dreamily upon the grove of huge
elm trees that covered the distant hills

Morning Ken said he briefly sitting beside his young friend and
taking the book in his own hand The margins of the printed pages were
fairly covered with drawings of every description The far away trees
were there and the nearby rose gardens There was a cat spitting at
an angry dog caricatures of old Misery and James the gardener and
of Aunt Jane and even Silas Watson himselfall so clearly depicted
that the lawyer suddenly wondered if they were not clever and an
evidence of genius But the boy turned to look at him and the next
moment seized the book from his grasp and sent it flying through
the open window uttering at the same time a rude exclamation of
impatience

The lawyer quietly lighted his pipe

Why did you do that Kenneth he asked The pictures are clever
enough to be preserved I did not know you have a talent for drawing

The boy glanced at him but answered nothing and the lawyer thought
best not to pursue the subject After smoking a moment in silence he
remarked

Your aunt is failing fast Although no relative Kenneth had been
accustomed to speak of Jane Merrick as his aunt

Getting neither word nor look in reply the lawyer presently continued

I do not think she will live much longer

The boy stared from the window and drummed on the sill with his
fingers

When she dies said Mr Watson in a musing tone there will be a
new mistress at Elmhurst and you will have to move out

The boy now turned to look at him enquiringly

You are twenty and you are not ready for college You would be of no
use in the commercial world You have not even the capacity to become
a clerk What will you do Kenneth Where will you go

The boy shrugged his shoulders

When will Aunt Jane die he asked

I hope she will live many days yet She may die tomorrow

When she does Ill answer your question said the boy roughly
When Im turned out of this placewhich is part prison and part
paradiseIll do something I dont know what and I wont bother
about it till the time comes But Ill do something

Could you earn a living asked the old lawyer

Perhaps not but Ill get one Will I be a beggar

I dont know It depends on whether Aunt Jane leaves you anything in
her will

I hope she wont leave me a cent cried the boy with sudden
fierceness I hate her and will be glad when she is dead and out of
my way

KennethKenneth lad

I hate her he persisted with blazing eyes She has insulted me
scorned me humiliated me every moment since I have known her Ill be
glad to have her die and I dont want a cent of her miserable money

Money remarked the old man knocking the ashes from his pipe is
very necessary to one who is incompetent to earn his salt And the
money she leaves youif she really does leave you anywont be
hers remember but your Uncle Toms

Uncle Tom was good to my father said the boy softening

Well Uncle Tom gave his money to Aunt Jane whom he had expected
to marry but he asked her to care for his relatives and shell
doubtless give you enough to live on But the place will go to some
one else and that means you must move on

Who will have Elmhurst asked the boy

One of your aunts nieces probably She has three it seems all of
them young girls and she has invited them to come here to visit her

Girls Girls at Elmhurst cried the boy shrinking back with a look
of terror in his eyes

To be sure One of the nieces it seems refuses to come but there
will be two of them to scramble for your aunts affection

She has none declared the boy

Or her money which is the same thing The one she likes the best
will get the estate

Kenneth smiled and with the change of expression his face lighted
wonderfully

Poor Aunt he said Almost I am tempted to be sorry for her Two
girlsfighting one against the other for Elmhurstand both fawning
before a cruel and malicious old woman who could never love anyone but
herself

And her flowers suggested the lawyer

Oh yes and perhaps James Tell me why should she love James who
is a mere gardener and hate me

James tends the flowers and the flowers are Jane Merricks very
life Isnt that the explanation

I dont know

The girls need not worry you Kenneth It will be easy for you to
keep out of their way

When will they come

Next week I believe

The boy looked around helplessly with the air of a caged tiger

Perhaps they wont know Im here he said

Perhaps not Ill tell Misery to bring all your meals to this room
and no one ever comes to this end of the garden But if they find you
Kenneth and scare you out of your den run over to me and Ill keep
you safe until the girls are gone

Thank you Mr Watson more graciously than was his wont It isnt
that Im afraid of girls you know but they may want to insult me
just as their aunt does and I couldnt bear any more cruelty

I know nothing about them said the lawyer so I cant vouch in any
way for Aunt Janes nieces But they are young and it is probable
theyll be as shy and uncomfortable here at Elmhurst as you are
yourself And after all Kenneth boy the most important thing just
now is your own future What in the world is to become of you

Oh that answered the boy relapsing into his sullen mood I
cant see that it matters much one way or another Anyhow Ill not
bother my head about it until the time comes and as far as youre
concerned its none of your business




CHAPTER VII

THE FIRST WARNING


For a day or two Jane Merrick seemed to improve in health Indeed
Martha Phibbs declared her mistress was better than she had been for
weeks Then one night the old attendant was awakened by a scream
and rushed to her mistress side

What is it maam she asked tremblingly

My leg I cant move my leg gasped the mistress of Elmhurst Rub
it you old fool Rub it till you drop and see if you can bring back
the life to it

Martha rubbed of course but the task was useless Oscar the groom
was sent on horseback for the nearest doctor who came just as day
was breaking He gave the old woman a brief examination and shook his
head

Its the first warning said he but nothing to be frightened
about That is for the present

Is it paralysis asked Jane Merrick

Yes a slight stroke

But Ill have another

Perhaps in time

How long

It may be a weekor a monthor a year Sometimes there is
never another stroke Dont worry maam Just lie still and be
comfortable

Huh grunted the old woman But she became more composed and obeyed
the doctors instructions with unwonted meekness Silas Watson arrived
during the forenoon and pressed her thin hand with real sympathy
for these two were friends despite the great difference in their
temperaments

Shall I draw your will Jane he asked No she snapped Im not
going to die just yet I assure you I shall live to carry out my
plans Silas

She did live and grew better as the days wore on although she never
recovered the use of the paralyzed limb

Each day Phibbs drew the invalid chair to the porch and old James
lifted it to the garden walk where his mistress might enjoy the
flowers he so carefully and skillfully tended They seldom spoke
together these two yet there seemed a strange bond of sympathy
between them

At last the first of July arrived and Oscar was dispatched to the
railway station four miles distant to meet Miss Elizabeth De
Graf the first of the nieces to appear in answer to Jane Merricks
invitation

Beth looked very charming and fresh in her new gown and she greeted
her aunt with a calm graciousness that would have amazed the professor
to behold She had observed carefully the grandeur and beauty of
Elmhurst as she drove through the grounds and instantly decided the
place was worth an effort to win

So this is Elizabeth is it asked Aunt June as the girl stood
before her for inspection You may kiss me child

Elizabeth advanced striving to quell the antipathy she felt to kiss
the stern featured old woman and touched her lips to the wrinkled
forehead

Jane Merrick laughed a bit sneeringly while Beth drew back still
composed and looked at her relative enquiringly

Well what do you think of me demanded Aunt Jane as if embarrassed
at the scrutiny she received

Surely it is too early to ask me that replied Beth gently I am
going to try to like you and my first sight of my new aunt leads me
to hope I shall succeed

Why shouldnt you like me cried the old woman Why must you try to
like your mothers sister

Beth flushed She had promised herself not to become angry or
discomposed whatever her aunt might say or do but before she could
control herself an indignant expression flashed across her face and
Jane Merrick saw it

There are reasons said Beth slowly why your name is seldom
mentioned in my fathers family Until your letter came I scarcely
knew I possessed an aunt It was your desire we should become better
acquainted and I am here for that purpose I hope we shall become
friends Aunt Jane but until then it is better we should not discuss
the past

The woman frowned It was not difficult for her to read the character
of the child before her and she knew intuitively that Beth was
strongly prejudiced against her but was honestly trying not to allow
that prejudice to influence her She decided to postpone further
interrogations until another time

Your journey has tired you she said abruptly Ill have Misery
show you to your room

She touched a bell beside her

Im not tired but Ill go to my room if you please answered Beth
who realized that she had in some way failed to make as favorable an
impression as she had hoped When may I see you again

When I send for you snapped Aunt Jane as the housekeeper entered
I suppose you know I am a paralytic and liable to die at any time

I am very sorry said Beth hesitatingly You do not seem very
ill

Im on my last legs I may not live an hour But thats none of your
business I suppose By the way I expect your cousin on the afternoon
train

Beth gave a start of surprise

My cousin she asked

Yes Louise Merrick

Oh said Beth and stopped short

What do you mean by that enquired Aunt Jane with a smile that was
rather malicious

I did not know I had a cousin said the girl That is correcting
herself I did not know whether Louise Merrick was alive or not
Mother has mentioned her name once or twice in my presence but not
lately

Well shes alive Very much alive I believe And shes coming to
visit me while you are here I expect you to be friends

To be sure said Beth nevertheless discomfited at the news

We dine at seven said Aunt Jane I always lunch in my own room
and you may do the same and with a wave of her thin hand she
dismissed the girl who thoughtfully followed the old housekeeper
through the halls

It was not going to be an easy task to win this old womans affection
Already she rebelled at the necessity of undertaking so distasteful a
venture and wondered if she had not made a mistake in trying to curb
her natural frankness and to conciliate a creature whose very nature
seemed antagonistic to her own And this new cousin Louise Merrick
why was she coming to Elmhurst To compete for the prize Beth had
already determined to win In that case she must consider carefully
her line of action that no rival might deprive her of this great
estate Beth felt that she could fight savagely for an object she so
much desired Her very muscles hardened and grew tense at the thought
of conflict as she walked down the corridor in the wake of old Misery
the housekeeper She had always resented the sordid life at Cloverton
She had been discontented with her lot since her earliest girlhood
and longed to escape the constant bickerings of her parents and their
vain struggles to obtain enough money to keep up appearances and
drive the wolf from the door And here was an opportunity to win a
fortune and a home beautiful enough for a royal princess All that was
necessary was to gain the esteem of a crabbed garrulous old woman
who had doubtless but a few more weeks to live It must be done
in one way or another but how How could she outwit this unknown
cousin and inspire the love of Aunt Jane

If theres any stuff of the right sort in my nature decided the
girl as she entered her pretty bedchamber and threw herself into a
chair Ill find a way to win out One thing is certainIll never
again have another chance at so fine a fortune and if I fail to get
it I shall deserve to live in poverty forever afterward

Suddenly she noticed the old housekeeper standing before her and
regarding her with a kindly interest In an instant she sprang up
threw her arms around Misery and kissed her furrowed cheek

Thank you for being so kind said she Ive never been away from
home before and you must be a mother to me while Im at Elmhurst

Old Misery smiled and stroked the girls glossy head

Bless the child she said delightedly of course Ill be a mother
to you Youll need a bit of comforting now and then my dear if
youre going to live with Jane Merrick

Is she cross asked Beth softly

At times shes a fiend confided the old housekeeper in almost a
whisper But dont you mind her tantrums or lay em to heart and
youll get along with her all right

Thank you said the girl Ill try not to mind

Do you need anything else deary asked Misery with a glance around
the room

Nothing at all thank you

The housekeeper nodded and softly withdrew

That was one brilliant move at any rate said Beth to herself as
she laid aside her hat and prepared to unstrap her small trunk Ive
made a friend at Elmhurst who will be of use to me and I shall make
more before long Come as soon as you like Cousin Louise Youll have
to be more clever than I am if you hope to win Elmhurst




CHAPTER VIII

THE DIPLOMAT


Aunt Jane was in her garden enjoying the flowers This was her
especial garden surrounded by a highbox hedge and quite distinct
from the vast expanse of shrubbery and flowerbeds which lent so much
to the beauty of the grounds at Elmhurst Aunt Jane knew and loved
every inch of her property She had watched the shrubs personally for
many years and planned all the alterations and the construction of
the flowerbeds which James had so successfully attended to Each
morning when her health permitted she had inspected the greenhouses
and issued her brief ordersbrief because her slightest word to the
old gardener incurred the fulfillment of her wishes But this bit of
garden adjoining her own rooms was her especial pride and contained
the choicest plants she had been able to secure So since she had
been confined to her chair the place had almost attained to the
dignity of a private drawingroom and on bright days she spent many
hours here delighting to feast her eyes with the rich coloring of the
flowers and to inhale their fragrance For however gruff Jane Merrick
might be to the people with whom she came in contact she was always
tender to her beloved flowers and her nature invariably softened when
in their presence

By and by Oscar the groom stepped through an opening in the hedge
and touched his hat

Has my niece arrived asked his mistress sharply

Shes on the way mum the man answered grinning She stopped
outside the grounds to pick wild flowers an said I was to tell you
shed walk the rest o the way

To pick wild flowers

Thats what she said mum Shes that fond of em she couldnt
resist it I was to come an tell you this mum an shell follow me
directly

Aunt Jane stared at the man sternly and he turned toward her an
unmoved countenance Oscar had been sent to the station to meet Louise
Merrick and drive her to Elmhurst but this strange freak on the part
of her guest set the old woman thinking what her object could be Wild
flowers were well enough in their way but those adjoining the grounds
of Elmhurst were very ordinary and unattractive and Miss Merricks
aunt was expecting her Perhaps

A sudden light illumined the mystery

See here Oscar has this girl been questioning you

She asked a few questions mum

About me

Some of em if I remember right mum was about you

And you told her I was fond of flowers

I may have just mentioned that you liked em mum

Aunt Jane gave a scornful snort and the man responded in a curious
way He winked slowly and laboriously still retaining the solemn
expression on his face

You may go Oscar Have the girls luggage placed in her room

Yes mum

He touched his hat and then withdrew leaving Jane Merrick with a
frown upon her brow that was not caused by his seeming impertinence

Presently a slight and graceful form darted through the opening in the
hedge and approached the chair wherein Jane Merrick reclined

Oh my dear dear aunt cried Louise How glad I am to see you at
last and how good of you to let me come here and she bent over and
kissed the stern unresponsive face with an enthusiasm delightful to
behold

This is Louise I suppose said Aunt Jane stiffly You are welcome
to Elmhurst

Tell me how you are continued the girl kneeling beside the chair
and taking the withered hands gently in her own Do you suffer any
And are you getting better dear aunt in this beautiful garden with
the birds and the sunshine

Get up said the elder woman roughly Youre spoiling your gown

Louise laughed gaily

Never mind the gown she answered Tell me about yourself Ive
been so anxious since your last letter

Aunt Janes countenance relaxed a trifle To speak of her broken
health always gave her a sort of grim satisfaction

Im dying as you can plainly see she announced My days are
numbered Louise If you stay long enough you can gather wild flowers
for my coffin

Louise flushed a trifle A bunch of buttercups and forgetmenots was
fastened to her girdle and she had placed a few marguerites in her
hair

Dont laugh at these poor things she said deprecatingly Im so
fond of flowers and we find none growing wild in the cities you
know

Jane Merrick looked at her reflectively

How old are you Louise she asked

Just seventeen Aunt

I had forgotten you are so old as that Let me see Elizabeth cannot
be more than fifteen

Elizabeth

Elizabeth De Graf your cousin She arrived at Elmhurst this morning
and will be your companion while you are here

That is nice said Louise

I hope you will be friends

Why not Aunt I havent known much of my relations in the past you
know so it pleases me to find an aunt and a cousin at the same time
I am sure I shall love you both Let me fix your pillowyou do not
seem comfortable There Isnt that better patting the pillow
deftly Im afraid you have needed more loving care than a paid
attendant can give you glancing at old Martha Phibbs who stood some
paces away and lowering her voice that she might not be overheard
But for a time at least I mean to be your nurse and look after
your wants You should have sent for me before Aunt Jane

Dont trouble yourself Phibbs knows my ways and does all that is
required said the invalid rather testily Run away now Louise
The housekeeper will show you to your room Its opposite Elizabeths
and you will do well to make her acquaintance at once I shall expect
you both to dine with me at seven

Cant I stay here a little longer pleaded Louise We havent
spoken two words together as yet and Im not a bit tired or anxious
to go to my room What a superb oleander this is Is it one of your
favorites Aunt Jane

Run away repeated the woman I want to be alone

The girl sighed and kissed her again stroking the gray hair softly
with her white hand

Very well Ill go she said But I dont intend to be treated as
a strange guest dear Aunt for that would drive me to return home at
once You are my fathers eldest sister and I mean to make you love
me if you will give me the least chance to do so

She looked around her enquiringly and Aunt Jane pointed a bony
finger at the porch

That is the way Phibbs will take you to Misery the housekeeper and
then return to me Remember I dine promptly at seven

I shall count the minutes said Louise and with a laugh and a
graceful gesture of adieu turned to follow Martha into the house

Jane Merrick looked after her with a puzzled expression upon her face

Were she in the least sincere she muttered Louise might prove a
very pleasant companion But shes not sincere shes coddling me to
win my money and if I dont watch out shell succeed The girls a
born diplomat and weighed in the balance against sincerity diplomacy
will often tip the scales I might do worse than to leave Elmhurst to
a clever woman But I dont know Beth yet Ill wait and see which
girl is the most desirable and give them each an equal chance




CHAPTER IX

COUSINS


Come in called Beth answering a knock at her door

Louise entered and with a little cry ran forward and caught Beth in
her arms kissing her in greeting

You must be my new cousinCousin Elizabethand Im awfully glad to
see you at last she said holding the younger girl a little away
that she might examine her carefully

Beth did not respond to the caress She eyed her opponent sharply
for she knew well enough even in that first moment that they were
engaged in a struggle for supremacy in Aunt Janes affections and
that in the battles to come no quarter could be asked or expected

So they stood at arms length facing one another and secretly forming
an estimate each of the others advantages and accomplishments

Shes pretty enough but has no style whatever was Louises
conclusion Neither has she tact nor selfpossession or even a
prepossessing manner She wears her new gown in a dowdy manner and one
can read her face easily Theres little danger in this quarter Im
sure so I may as well be friends with the poor child

As for Beth she saw at once that her new cousin was older and more
experienced in the ways of the world and therefore liable to prove
a dangerous antagonist Slender and graceful of form attractive
of feature and dainty in manner Louise must be credited with
many advantages but against these might be weighed her evident
insinceritythe volubility and gush that are so often affected to
hide ones real nature and which so shrewd and suspicious a woman as
Aunt Jane could not fail to readily detect Altogether Beth was not
greatly disturbed by her cousins appearance and suddenly realizing
that they had been staring at one another rather rudely she said
pleasantly enough

Wont you sit down

Of course we must get acquainted replied Louise gaily and
perched herself crosslegged upon the windowseat surrounded by a
mass of cushions

I didnt know you were here until an hour ago she continued But
as soon as Aunt Jane told me I ran to my room unpacked and settled
the few traps I brought with me and here I amprepared for a good
long chat and to love you just as dearly as you will let me

I knew you were coming but not until this morning answered Beth
slowly Perhaps had I known I would not have accepted our Aunts
invitation

Ah Why not enquired the other as if in wonder

Beth hesitated

Have you known Aunt Jane before today she asked

No

Nor I The letter asking me to visit her was the first I have ever
received from her Even my mother her own sister does not correspond
with her I was brought up to hate her very name as a selfish
miserly old woman But since she asked me to visit her we judged she
had softened and might wish to become friendly and so I accepted the
invitation I had no idea you were also invited

But why should you resent my being here Louise asked smiling
Surely two girls will have a better time in this lonely old place
than one could have alone For my part I am delighted to find you at
Elmhurst

Thank you said Beth Thats a nice thing to say but I doubt if
its true Dont lets beat around the bush I hate hypocrisy and if
were going to be friends lets be honest with one another from the
start

Well queried Louise evidently amused

Its plain to me that Aunt Jane has invited us here to choose which
one of us shall inherit her moneyand Elmhurst Shes old and feeble
and she hasnt any other relations

Oh yes she has corrected Louise

You mean Patricia Doyle

Yes

What do you know of her

Nothing at all

Where does she live

I havent the faintest idea

Louise spoke as calmly as if she had not mailed Patricias defiant
letter to Aunt Jane or discovered her cousins identity in the little
hairdresser from Madame Bornes establishment

Has Aunt Jane mentioned her continued Beth

Not in my presence

Then we may conclude shes left out of the arrangement said Beth
calmly And as I said Aunt Jane is likely to choose one of us to
succeed her at Elmhurst I hoped I had it all my own way but its
evident I was mistaken Youll fight for your chance and fight mighty
hard

Louise laughed merrily

How funny she exclaimed after a moment during which Beth frowned
at her darkly Why my dear cousin I dont want Aunt Janes money

You dont

Not a penny of it nor Elmhurst nor anything you can possibly lay
claim to my dear My mother and I are amply provided for and I am
only here to find rest from my social duties and to get acquainted
with my dead fathers sister That is all

Oh said Beth lying back in her chair with a sigh of relief

So it was really a splendid idea of yours to be frank with me at our
first meeting continued Louise cheerfully for it has led to your
learning the truth and I am sure you will never again grieve me by
suggesting that I wish to supplant you in Aunt Janes favor Now tell
me something about yourself and your people Are you poor

Poor as poverty said Beth gloomily My father teaches music and
mother scolds him continually for not being able to earn enough money
to keep out of debt

Hasnt Aunt Jane helped you

Weve never seen a cent of her money although father has tried at
times to borrow enough to help him out of his difficulties

Thats strange She seems like such a dear kindly old lady said
Louise musingly

I think shes horrid answered Beth angrily but I mustnt let her
know it I even kissed her when she asked me to and it sent a shiver
all down my back

Louise laughed with genuine amusement

You must dissemble Cousin Elizabeth she advised and teach our
aunt to love you For my part I am fond of everyone and it delights
me to fuss around invalids and assist them I ought to have been a
trained nurse you know but of course theres no necessity of my
earning a living

I suppose not said Beth Then after a thoughtful silence she
resumed abruptly Whats to prevent Aunt Jane leaving you her
property even if you are rich and dont need it You say you like to
care for invalids and I dont Suppose Aunt Jane prefers you to me
and wills you all her money

Why that would be beyond my power to prevent answered Louise with
a little yawn

Beths face grew hard again

Youre deceiving me she declared angrily Youre trying to make
me think you dont want Elmhurst when youre as anxious to get it as
I am

My dear Elizabethby the way thats an awfully long name what do
they call you Lizzie or Bessie or

They call me Beth sullenly

Then my dear Beth let me beg you not to borrow trouble or to doubt
one who wishes to be your friend Elmhurst would be a perfect bore
to me I wouldnt know what to do with it I couldnt live in this
outoftheway corner of the world you know

But suppose she leaves it to you persisted Beth You wouldnt
refuse it I imagine

Louise seemed to meditate

Cousin she said at length Ill make a bargain with you I cant
refuse to love and pet Aunt Jane just because she has money and my
sweet cousin Beth is anxious to inherit it But Ill not interfere in
any way with your chances and Ill promise to sing your praises to
our aunt persistently Furthermore in case she selects me as her
heir I will agree to transfer half of the estate to youthe half
that consists of Elmhurst

Is there much more asked Beth

I havent any list of Aunt Janes possessions so I dont know But
you shall have Elmhurst if I get it because the place would be of no
use to me

Its a magnificent estate said Beth looking at her cousin
doubtfully

It shall be yours dear whatever Aunt Jane decides See this is a
compact and Ill seal it with a kiss

She sprang up and kneeling beside Beth kissed her fervently

Now shall we be friends she asked lightly Now will you abandon
all those naughty suspicions and let me love you

Beth hesitated The suggestion seemed preposterous Such generosity
savored of play acting and Louises manner was too airy to be
genuine Somehow she felt that she was being laughed at by this
slender graceful girl who was scarcely older than herself but she
was too unsophisticated to know how to resent it Louise insisted upon
warding off her enmity or at least establishing a truce and Beth
however suspicious and ungracious could find no way of rejecting the
overtures

Were I in your place she said I would never promise to give up a
penny of the inheritance If I win it I shall keep it all

To be sure I should want you to my dear

Then since we have no cause to quarrel we may as well become
friends continued Beth her features relaxing a little their set
expression

Louise laughed again ignoring the others brusqueness and was soon
chatting away pleasantly upon other subjects and striving to draw Beth
out of her natural reserve

The younger girl had no power to resist such fascinations Louise
knew the big world and talked of it with charming naivete and
Beth listened rapturously Such a girl friend it had never been her
privilege to have before and when her suspicions were forgotten she
became fairly responsive and brightened wonderfully

They dressed in time for dinner and met Aunt Jane and Silas Watson
the lawyer in the great drawingroom The old gentleman was very
attentive and courteous during the stately dinner and did much to
relieve the girls embarrassment Louise indeed seemed quite at home
in her new surroundings and chatted most vivaciously during the meal
but Aunt Jane was strangely silent and Beth had little to say and
seemed awkward and ill at ease

The old lady retired to her own room shortly after dinner and
presently sent a servant to request Mr Watson to join her

Silas she said when he entered what do you think of my nieces

They are very charming girls he answered although they are at
an age when few girls show to good advantage Why did you not invite
Kenneth to dinner Jane

The boy

Yes They would be more at ease in the society of a young gentleman
more nearly their own age

Kenneth is a bear He is constantly saying disagreeable things In
other words he is not gentlemanly and the girls shall have nothing
to do with him

Very well said the lawyer quietly

Which of my nieces do you prefer asked the old lady after a pause

I cannot say on so short an acquaintance he answered with
gravity Which do you prefer Jane

They are equally unsatisfactory she answered I cannot imagine
Elmhurst belonging to either Silas Then she added with an abrupt
change of manner You must go to New York for me at once

Tonight

No tomorrow morning I must see that other niecethe one who defies
me and refuses to answer my second letter

Patricia Doyle

Yes Find her and argue with her Tell her I am a crabbed old woman
with a whim to know her and that I shall not die happy unless she
comes to Elmhurst Bribe her threaten herkidnap her if necessary
Silas but get her to Elmhurst as quickly as possible

Ill do my best Jane But why are you so anxious

My time is drawing near old friend she replied less harshly than
usual and this matter of my will lies heavily on my conscience What
if I should die tonight

He did not answer

There would be a dozen heirs to fight for my money and dear old
Elmhurst would be sold to strangers she resumed with bitterness
But I dont mean to cross over just yet Silas even if one limb is
dead already I shall hang on until I get this matter settled and I
cant settle it properly without seeing all three of my nieces One of
these is too hard and the other too soft Ill see what Patricia is
like

She may prove even more undesirable said the lawyer

In that case Ill pack her back again and choose between these two
But you must fetch her Silas that I may know just what I am doing
And you must fetch her at once

Ill do the best I can Jane repeated the old lawyer




CHAPTER X

THE MAN WITH THE BUNDLE


In the harnessroom above the stable sat Duncan Muir the coachman and
most important servant with the exception of the head gardener in
Miss Merricks establishment Duncan baldheaded but with white and
bushy sidewhiskers was engaged in the serious business of oiling and
polishing the state harness which had not been used for many months
past But that did not matter Thursday was the day for oiling the
harness and so on Thursday he performed the task never daring to
entrust a work so important to a subordinate

In one corner of the little room Kenneth Forbes squatted upon a bench
with an empty pine box held carelessly in his lap While Duncan worked
the boy was busy with his pencil but neither had spoken for at least
a half hour

Finally the aged coachman without looking up enquired

What do ye think o em Kenneth lad

Think o whom Don

The young leddies

What young ladies

Miss Janes nieces as Oscar brought from the station yesterday

The boy looked astonished and leaned over the box in his lap eagerly

Tell me Don he said I was away with my gun all yesterday and
heard nothing of it

Why it seems Miss Janes invited em to make her a visit

But not yet Don Not so soon

Natheless theyre here

How many Don

Two lad A bonny young thing came on the morning train an a nice
wideawake one by the two oclock

Girls with an accent of horror

Young females anyhow said Donald polishing a buckle briskly

The boy glared at him fixedly

Will they be running about the place Don

Most likely Twould be a shame to shut them up with the poor missus
this glad weather But why not Theyll be company for ye Kenneth
lad

How long will they stay

Mabbe for aye Oscar forbys one or the ither o em will own the
place when Miss Jane gies up the ghost

The boy sat silent a moment thinking upon this speech Then with a
cry that was almost a scream he dashed the box upon the floor and
flew out the door as if crazed and Donald paused to listen to his
footsteps clattering down the stairs

Then the old man groaned dismally shaking his sidewhiskers with a
negative expression that might have conveyed worlds of meaning to one
able to interpret it But his eye fell upon the pine box which had
rolled to his feet and he stooped to pick it up Upon the smoothly
planed side was his own picture most deftly drawn showing him
engaged in polishing the harness Every strap and buckle was depicted
with rare fidelity there was no doubt at all of the sponge and bottle
on the stool beside him or the cloth in his hand Even his bow
spectacles rested upon the bridge of his nose at exactly the right
angle and his under lip protruded just as it had done since he was a
lad

Donald was not only deeply impressed by such an exhibition of art he
was highly gratified at being pictured and full of wonder that the
boy could do such a thing wi a wee pencil an a bit o board He
turned the box this way and that to admire the sketch and finally
arose and brought a hatchet with which he carefully pried the board
away from the box Then he carried his treasure to a cupboard where
he hid it safely behind a row of tall bottles

Meantime Kenneth had reached the stable thrown a bridle over the head
of a fine sorrel mare and scorning to use a saddle leaped upon her
back and dashed down the lane and out at the rear gate upon the old
turnpike road

His head was whirling with amazement his heart full of indignation
Girls Girls at Elmhurstnieces and guests of the fierce old woman
he so bitterly hated Then indeed his days of peace and quiet were
ended These dreadful creatures would prowl around everywhere they
might even penetrate the shrubbery to the foot of the stairs leading
to his own retired room they would destroy his happiness and drive
him mad

For this moody silent youth had been strangely happy in his life
at Elmhurst despite the neglect of the grim old woman who was its
mistress and the fact that no one aside from Lawyer Watson seemed to
care whether he lived or died

Perhaps Donald did Good old Don was friendly and seldom bothered him
by talking Perhaps old Misery liked him a bit also But these were
only servants and almost as helpless and dependent as himself

Still he had been happy He began to realize it now that these awful
girls had come to disturb his peace The thought filled him with grief
and rebellion and resentment yet there was nothing he could do to
alter the fact that Donalds young females were already here and
prepared doubtless to stay

The sorrel was dashing down the road at a great pace but the boy
clung firmly to his seat and gloried in the breeze that fanned his hot
cheeks Away and away he raced until he reached the crossroads miles
away and down this he turned and galloped as recklessly as before
The sun was hot today and the sorrels flanks begun to steam and
show flecks of white upon their glossy surface He turned again to the
left entering upon a broad highway that would lead him straight home
at last but he had almost reached the little village of Elmwood
which was the railway station before he realized his cruelty to the
splendid mare he bestrode Then indeed he fell to a walk patting
Noras neck affectionately and begging her to forgive him for his
thoughtlessness The mare tossed her head in derision However she
might sweat and pant she liked the glorious pace even better than her
rider

Through the village he paced moodily the bridle dangling loosely on
the mares neck The people paused to look at him curiously but he
had neither word nor look for any

He did not know one of them by name and cared little how much they
might speculate upon his peculiar position at the big house

Then riding slowly up the hedge bordered road his troubles once more
assailed him and he wondered if there was not some spot upon the
broad earth to which he could fly for retirement until the girls had
left Elmhurst for good

Nora shied and he looked up to discover that he had nearly run down a
pedestriana stout little man with a bundle under his arm who held
up one hand as if to arrest him

Involuntarily he drew rein and stopped beside the traveler with a
look of inquiry

Sorry to trouble you sir remarked the little man in a cheery
voice but I aint just certain about my way

Where do you want to go asked the boy

To Jane Merricks place They call it Elmhurst I guess

Its straight ahead said Kenneth as the mare walked on His
questioner also started and paced beside him

Far from here

A mile perhaps

They said it was three from the village but I guess Ive come a
dozen aready

The boy did not reply to this There was nothing offensive in the
mans manner He spoke with an easy familiarity that made it difficult
not to respond with equal frank cordiality and there was a shrewd
expression upon his wrinkled smoothshaven face that stamped him a
man who had seen life in many of its phases

Kenneth who resented the companionship of most people seemed
attracted by the man and hesitated to gallop on and leave him

Know Jane Merrick asked the stranger

The boy nodded

Like her

I hate her he said savagely

The man laughed a bit uneasily

Then its the same Jane as ever he responded with a shake of his
grizzled head Do you know I sort o hoped shed reformed and Id
be glad to see her again They tell me shes got money

The boy looked at him in surprise

She owns Elmhurst and has mortgages on a dozen farms around here
and property in New York and thousands of dollars in the bank he
said Aunt Janes rich

Aunt Jane echoed the man quickly Whats your name lad

Kenneth Forbes

A shake of the head

Dont recollect any Forbeses in the family

She isnt really my aunt said the boy and she doesnt treat me
as an aunt either but shes my guardian and Ive always called her
Aunt rather than say Miss Merrick

Shes never married has she

No She was engaged to my Uncle Tom who owned Elmhurst He was
killed in a railway accident and then it was found hed left her all
he had

I see

So when my parents died Aunt Jane took me for Uncle Toms sake and
keeps me out of charity

I see Quite soberly this time

The boy slid off the mare and walked beside the little man holding
the bridle over his arm They did not speak again for some moments

Finally the stranger asked

Are Janes sisters livingJulia and Violet

I dont know But there are two of her nieces at Elmhurst

Ha Who are they

Girls with bitterness I havent seen them

The stranger whistled

Dont like girls I take it

No I hate them

Another long pause Then the boy suddenly turned questioner

You know AuntMiss Merrick sir

I used to when we were both younger

Any relation sir

Just a brother thats all

Kenneth stopped short and the mare stopped and the little man with
a whimsical smile at the boys astonishment also stopped

I didnt know she had a brother sirthat is living

She had two but Wills dead years ago Im told Im the other

John Merrick

Thats me I went west a long time ago before you were born I
guess We dont get much news on the coast so I sort of lost track of
the folks back east and I reckon they lost track of me for the same
reason

You were the tinsmith

The same Bad pennies always return they say Ive come back to look
up the family and find how many are left Curious sort of a job isnt
it

I dont know Perhaps its natural replied the boy reflectively
But Im sorry you came to Aunt Jane first

Why

Shes in bad healthquite ill you knowand her tempers dreadful
Perhaps sheshe

I know But I havent seen her in years and after all shes my
sister And back at the old home where I went first no one knew
anything about what had become of the family except Jane They kept
track of her because she suddenly became rich and a great lady and
that was a surprising thing to happen to a Merrick Weve always been
a poor lot you know

The boy glanced at the bundle pityingly and the little man caught
the look and smiled his sweet cheery smile

My valise was too heavy to carry he said so I wrapped up a few
things in case Jane wanted me to stay over night And thats why I
didnt get a horse at the livery you know Somebodyd have to take it
back again

Im sure shell ask you to stay sir And if she doesnt you come
out to the stable and let me know and Ill drive you to town again
Donaldthats the coachmanis my friend and hell let me have the
horse if I ask him

Thank you lad returned the man gratefully I thought a little
exercise would do me good but this three miles has seemed like thirty
to me

Were here at last said the boy turning into the driveway
Seeing that youre her brother sir I advise you to go right up to
the front door and ring the bell

I will said the man

I always go around the back way myself

I see

The boy turned away but in a moment halted again His interest in
Miss Janes brother John was extraordinary

Another thing he said hesitating

Well

Youd better not say you met me you know It wouldnt be a good
introduction She hates me as much as I hate her

Very good my lad Ill keep mum

The boy nodded and turned away to lead Nora to the stable The man
looked after him a moment and shook his head sadly

Poor boy he whispered

Then he walked up to the front door and rang the bell




CHAPTER XI

THE MAD GARDENER


This seems to be a lazy place said Louise as she stood in the
doorway of Beths room to bid her good night I shall sleep until
late in the morning for I dont believe Aunt Jane will be on
exhibition before noon

At home I always get up at six oclock answered Beth

Six oclock Good gracious What for

To study my lessons and help get the breakfast

Dont you keep a maid

No said Beth rather surlily we have hard work to keep
ourselves

But you must be nearly through with school by this time I finished
my education ages ago

Did you graduate asked Beth

No it wasnt worth while declared Louise complacently Im sure
I know as much as most girls do and there are more useful lessons to
be learned from real life than from books

Good night said Beth

Good night answered the older girl and shut the door behind her

Beth sat for a time moodily thinking She did not like the way in
which her cousin assumed superiority over her The difference in
their ages did not account for the greater worldly wisdom Louise
had acquired and in much that she said and did Beth recognized a
shrewdness and experience that made her feel humbled and in a way
inferior to her cousin Nor did she trust the friendship Louise
expressed for her

Somehow nothing that the girl said seemed to ring true and Beth
already in her mind accused her of treachery and insincerity

As a matter of fact however she failed to understand her cousin
Louise really loved to be nice to people and to say nice things It
is true she schemed and intrigued to advance her personal welfare and
position in life but even her schemes were undertaken lightly and
carelessly and if they failed the girl would be the first to laugh at
her disappointment and try to mend her fortunes If others stood in
her way she might not consider them at all if she pledged her word
it might not always be profitable to keep it but she liked to be on
pleasant terms with everyone and would be amiable to the last no
matter what happened Comedy was her forte rather than tragedy If
tragedy entered her life she would probably turn it into ridicule
Wholly without care whimsical and generous to a degree if it suited
her mood Louise Merrick possessed a nature capable of great things
either for good or ill

It was no wonder her unsophisticated country cousin failed to
comprehend her although Beths intuition was not greatly at fault

Six oclock found Beth wide awake as usual so she quietly dressed
and taking her book under her arm started to make her way into the
gardens Despite Louises cynicism she had no intention of abandoning
her studies She had decided to fit herself for a teacher before Aunt
Janes invitation had come to her and this ambition would render it
necessary for her to study hard during vacations

If she became an heiress she would not need to teach but she was not
at all confident of her prospects and the girls practical nature
prompted her to carry out her plans until she was sure of the future

In the hall she met Phibbs shuffling along as if in pain

Good morning miss said the old servant

Beth looked at her thoughtfully This was Aunt Janes special and
confidential attendant

Do your feet hurt you she asked

Yes miss in the mornin theys awful bad Its being on em all the
day tendin to Miss Jane you know But after a time I gets more
used to the pain and dont feel it The mornins always the worst

She was passing on but Beth stopped her

Come into my room she said and led the way

Martha Phibbs followed reluctantly Miss Jane might already be awake
and demanding her services and she could not imagine what the young
lady wanted her for

But she entered the room and Beth went to a box and brought out a
bottle of lotion

Mother has the same trouble that you complain of she said
practically and here is a remedy that always gives her relief I
brought it with me in case I should take long tramps and get sore
feet

She gently pushed the old woman into a chair and then to Phibbs
utter amazement knelt down and unfastened her shoes and drew off her
stockings A moment later she was rubbing the lotion upon the poor
creatures swollen feet paying no attention to Marthas horrified
protests

There Now theyre sure to feel better said Beth pulling the worn
and darned stockings upon the womans feet again And you must take
this bottle to your room and use it every night and morning

Bless your dear heart cried Phibbs while tears of gratitude stood
in her faded eyes Im sure I feel twenty years younger aready But
you shouldnt a done it miss indeed you shouldnt

Im glad to help you said Beth rinsing her hands at the wash stand
and drying them upon a towel It would be cruel to let you suffer
when I can ease your pain

But what would Miss Jane say wailed old Martha throwing up her
hands in dismay

Shell never know a thing about it Its our secret Martha and Im
sure if I ever need a friend youll do as much for me

Ill do anything for you Miss Elizabeth was the reply as the
woman took the bottle of lotion and departed

Beth smiled

That was not a bad thought she said to herself again starting for
the gardens I have made a firm friend and done a kindly action at
the same timeand all while Cousin Louise is fast asleep

The housekeeper let her out at the side door after Beth had pressed
her hand and kissed her good morning

Youre looking quite bonny my dear said the old woman Do you
feel at home at all in this strange place

Not quite as yet answered Beth But I know I have one good friend
here and that comforts me

She found a path between high hedges that wandered away through the
grounds and along this she strolled until she reached a rose arbor
with a comfortable bench

Here she seated herself looking around her curiously The place
seemed little frequented but was kept with scrupulous care Even
at this hour a little way off could be heard the clickclick of
hedgeshears and Beth noted how neatly the paths were swept and how
carefully every rose on the arbor was protected

Elmhurst was a beautiful place Beth sighed as she wondered if it
would ever be hers Then she opened her book and began to work

During the next hour the click of the hedgeshears drew nearer but
the girl did not notice this In another half hour James himself came
into view intent upon his monotonous task Gradually the motionless
form of the girl and the plodding figure of the gardener drew
together until he stood but two yards distant Then he paused looked
toward the arbor and uttered an exclamation

Beth looked up

Good morning she said pleasantly

James stared at her but made no reply save a slight inclination of
his head

Am I in your way she asked

He turned his back to her then and began clipping away as before
Beth sprang up and laid a hand upon his arm arresting him Again he
turned to stare at her and in his eyes was a look almost of fear

She drew back

Why wont you speak to me enquired the girl gently Im a
stranger at Elmhurst but I want to be your friend Wont you let me

To her amazement James threw up his hands letting the shears clatter
to the ground and with a hoarse cry turned and fled up the path as
swiftly as he could go

Beth was really puzzled but as she stood silently looking after the
gardener she heard a soft laugh and found old Misery beside her

Its just his way Miss dont you be scared by anything that James
does said the woman Why at times he wont even speak to Miss
Jane

He isnt dumb is he asked Beth

Lor no But hes that odd an contrary he wont talk to a soul
Never did since the day Master Tom was killed James was travellin
with Master Tom you know and there was an accident an the train
run offn the track an tipped over James wasnt hurt at all but he
dragged Master Tom outn the wreck and sat by him until he died Then
James brought Master Toms body back home again but his mind
seemed to have got a shock in some way and he never was the same
afterwards He was powerful fond of young Master Tom But then we all
was

Poor man said Beth

After that resumed Misery all that James would do was to look
after the flowers Miss Jane after she came made him the head
gardener and hes proved a rare good one too But James he wont
even talk to Miss Jane nor even to his old friend Lawyer Watson who
used to be Master Toms special chum an comrade He does his duty
and obeys all Miss Janes orders as faithful as can be but he wont
talk an weve all give up tryin to make him

But why should I frighten him asked the girl

You tried to make him talk and youre a stranger Strangers always
affect James that way I remember when Miss Jane first came to
Elmhurst he screamed at the sight of her but when he found out that
Master Tom loved her and had given her Elmhurst James followed her
around like a dog and did everything she told him to But breakfast
is ready Miss I came to call you

Thank you said Beth turning to walk beside the housekeeper

According to Aunt Janes instructions the breakfast was served in her
own room and presently Louise dressed in a light silk kimona came
in bearing her tray to keep her cousin company she laughingly
announced

I should have slept an hour longer she yawned over her chocolate
but old Miserywho seems rightly namedinsisted on waking me just
that I might eat Isnt this a funny establishment

Its different from everything Im used to answered Beth gravely
but it seems very pleasant here and everyone is most kind and
attentive

Now Ill dress said Louise and well take a long walk together
and see the place

So it happened that Kenneth clattered down the road on the sorrel mare
just a moment before the girls emerged from the house and while he
was riding off his indignation at their presence at Elmhurst they
were doing just what his horrified imagination had depictedthat is
penetrating to all parts of the grounds to every nook in the spacious
old gardens and even to the stables where Beth endeavored to make a
friend of old Donald the coachman

However the graywhiskered Scotsman was not to be taken by storm
even by a pretty face His loyalty to the boy induced him to be wary
in associating with these strange young females and although he
welcomed them to the stable with glum civility he withheld his opinion
of them until he should know them better

In their rambles the girls found Kenneths own stair and were sitting
upon it when Phibbs came to summon Louise to attend upon Aunt Jane

She obeyed with alacrity for she wished to know more of the queer
relative whose guest she had become

Sit down said Aunt Jane very graciously as the girl entered

Louise leaned over the chair kissed her and patted her cheek
affectionately and then shook up the pillows to make them more
comfortable

I want you to talk to me announced Aunt Jane and to tell me
something of the city and the society in which you live Ive been so
long dead to the world that Ive lost track of people and things

Let me dress your hair at the same time said Louise pleadingly
It looks really frowsy and I can talk while I work

I cant lift my left hand said the invalid flushing and Phibbs
is a stupid ass

Never mind I can make it look beautiful in half a jiffy said the
girl standing behind the chair and drawing deftly the hairpins from
Aunt Janes scanty grey locks and you cant imagine how it pleases
me to fuss over anyone

It was surprising how meekly Aunt Jane submitted to this ordeal but
she plied the girl with many shrewd questions and Louise busily
working in a position where the old woman could not see her face
never hesitated for an answer She knew all the recent gossip of
fashionable society and retailed it glibly She had met this
celebrity at a ball and that one at a reception and she described
them minutely realizing that Aunt Jane would never be in a position
to contradict any assertion she might choose to make

Indeed Aunt Jane was really startled

However did your mother manage to gain an entree into society she
asked Your father was a poor man and of little account I know for
he was my own brother

He left us a very respectable life insurance said Louise demurely
and my mother had many friends who were glad to introduce us to good
society when we were able to afford such a luxury Father died twelve
years ago you know and for several years while I was at school
mother lived very quietly Then she decided it was time I made my
debut but for the last season we have been rather gay I admit

Are you rich asked Aunt Jane sharply

Mercy no laughed Louise who had finished her work and now sat her
aunts feet But we have enough for our requirements and that makes
us feel quite independent By the way auntie I want to return that
check you sent me It was awfully good and generous of you but I
didnt need it you know and so I want you to take it back

She drew the slip of paper from her pocket and pressed it into Aunt
Janes hand

Its quite enough for you to give me this nice treat in the country
resumed the girl calmly The change from the city will do me a world
of good and as I wanted to be quiet and rest I declined all my other
invitations for the summer to accept yours Isnt it glorious that we
can get acquainted at last And I quite love Elmhurst already

Aunt Jane was equally surprised and gratified The return of the check
for a hundred dollars was very pleasant She had drawn a similar check
for each of her three nieces believing that it would be necessary for
her to meet their expenses and she had considered the expenditure in
the nature of a business transaction But Patricia had flung one check
in her face practically and now Louise had voluntarily returned
another because she did not need the money Really Jane Merrick was
accomplishing her purpose for less money than she had expected and
she had hoarded her wealth for so many years that she disliked to
spend any of it foolishly

Louise had read her nature correctly It had been a little hard to
return so large a check but the girls policy was not to appear
before Aunt Jane as a poor relation but rather as a young lady fitted
by social education and position to become a gracious mistress of
Elmhurst This she believed would give her a powerful advantage over
all competitors

Whether she was right or not in this surmise it is certain that she
rose several points in Aunt Janes estimation during this interview
and when she was dismissed it was so graciously that she told herself
the money her little plot had cost had been well expended

Afterward Elizabeth was summoned to attend her aunt

I want to be amused Can you read aloud said the invalid

Not very well Im afraid But Ill be glad to try answered Beth
What do you like

Select your own book said Aunt Jane pointing to a heap of volumes
beside her

The girl hesitated Louise would doubtless have chosen a romance or
some light tale sure to interest for the hour and so amuse the old
lady But Beth erroneously judged that the aged and infirm love sober
and scholarly books and picked out a treatise that proved ineffably
dull and tedious

Aunt Jane sniffed and then smiled slyly and proceeded to settle
herself for a nap If the girl was a fool let her be properly
punished

Beth read for an hour uncertain whether her aunt were intensely
interested or really asleep At the end of that dreadful period old
Misery entered and aroused the sleeper without ceremony

Whats the matter asked Aunt Jane querrulously for she resented
being disturbed

Theres a man to see you Miss

Send him about his business

But

I wont see him I tell you

But he says hes your brother Miss

Who

Your brother

Miss Jane stared as if bewildered

Your brother John Miss

The invalid sank back upon her cushions with a sigh of resignation

I thought he was dead long ago but if hes alive I suppose Ill
have to see him she said Elizabeth leave the room Misery send
the man here




CHAPTER XII

UNCLE JOHN GETS ACQUAINTED


Beth went out to find Louise and discovered her standing near the
stables where a boy was rubbing down the sides of a sorrel mare with
wisps of straw

Something has happened she said to Louise in a troubled voice

What

A man has arrived who says he is Aunt Janes brother

Impossible Have you seen him

No he says hes Aunt Janes brother John

Oh I know The peddler or tinker or something or other who
disappeared years ago But it doesnt matter

It may matter a good deal said practical Beth Aunt Jane may leave
him her money

Why hes older than she is Ive heard mother say he was the eldest
of the family Aunt Jane wont leave her money to an old man you may
be sure

Beth felt a little reassured at this and stood for a moment beside
Louise watching the boy Presently Oscar came to him and after
touching his hat respectfully took the mare and led her into the
stable The boy turned away with his hands in his pockets and
strolled up a path unaware that the two dreaded girls had been
observing him

I wonder who that is said Beth

Well find out returned Louise I took him for a stable boy at
first But Oscar seemed to treat him as a superior

She walked into the stable followed by her cousin and found the
groom tying the mare

Who was the young man she asked

Which young man Miss

The one who has just arrived with the horse

Oh thats Master Kenneth Miss answered Oscar with a grin

Where did he come from

Master Kenneth Why he lives here

At the house

Yes Miss

Who is he

Master Toms nephewhe as used to own Elmhurst you know

Mr Thomas Bradley

The same Miss

Ah How long has Master Kenneth lived here

A good many years I cant just remember how long

Thank you Oscar

The girls walked away and when they were alone Louise remarked

Here is a more surprising discovery than Uncle John Beth The boy
has a better right than any of us to inherit Elmhurst

Then why did Aunt Jane send for us

Its a mystery dear Let us try to solve it

Come well ask the housekeeper said Beth Im sure old Misery
will tell us all we want to know

So they returned to the house and with little difficulty found the
old housekeeper

Master Kenneth she exclaimed Why hes just Master Toms nephew
thats all

Is this his home asked Beth

All the home hes got my dear His father and mother are both dead
and Miss Jane took him to care for just because she thought Master Tom
would a liked it

Is she fond of him enquired Louise

Fond of the boy Why Miss Jane just hates him for a fact She wont
even see him or have him near her So he keeps to his little room in
the left wing and eats and sleeps there

Its strange remarked Beth thoughtfully Isnt he a nice boy

Were all very fond of Master Kenneth replied the housekeeper
simply But Ill admit hes a queer lad and has a bad temper It may
be due to his lack of bringin up you know for he just runs wild
and old Mr Chase who comes from the village to tutor him is a poor
lot and lets the boy do as he pleases For that reason he wont
study and he wont work and Im sure I dont know whatever will
become of him when Miss Jane dies

Thank you said Beth much relieved and the girls walked away with
lighter hearts

Theres no danger in that quarter after all said Louise gaily
The boy is a mere hangeron You see Aunt Janes old sweetheart
Thomas Bradley left everything to her when he died and she can do as
she likes with it

After luncheon which they ate alone and unattended save by the maid
Susan who was old Miserys daughter the girls walked away to
the rose arbor where Beth declared they could read or sew quite
undisturbed

But sitting upon the bench they found a little old man his legs
extended his hands thrust deep into his pockets and a look of calm
meditation upon his round and placid face Between his teeth was a
black brier pipe which he puffed lazily

Beth was for drawing back but Louise took her arm and drew her
forward

Isnt this Uncle John she asked

The little man turned his eyes upon them withdrew his hands from his
pockets and his pipe from his mouth and then bowed profoundly

If you are my nieces then I am Uncle John he said affably Sit
down my dears and let us get acquainted

Louise smiled and her rapid survey took in the mans crumpled and
somewhat soiled shirtfront the frayed black necktie that seemed to
have done years of faithful service and the thick and dusty cowhide
boots His clothing was old and much worn and the thought crossed
her mind that Oscar the groom was far neater in appearance than this
newlyfound relative

Beth merely noticed that Uncle John was neither dignified nor imposing
in appearance She sat down beside himleaving a wide space between
themwith a feeling of disappointment that he was like all the rest
of the Merricks

You have just arrived we hear remarked Louise

Yes Walked up from the station this forenoon said Uncle John
Come to see Jane you know but hadnt any idea Id find two nieces
Hadnt any idea I possessed two nieces to be honest about it

I believe you have three said Louise in an amused tone

Three Whos the other

Why Patricia Doyle

Doyle Doyle Dont remember the name

I believe your sister Violet married a man named Doyle

So she did Captain Doyleor Major Doyleor some such fellow But
what is your name

I am Louise Merrick your brother Wills daughter

Oh And you turning to Beth

My mother was Julia Merrick said Beth not very graciously She
married Professor DeGraf I am Elizabeth DeGraf

Yes yes observed Uncle John nodding his head I remember Julia
very well as a girl She used to put on a lot of airs and jaw father
because he wouldnt have the old topbuggy painted every spring Same
now as ever I spose

Beth did not reply

And Wills dead and out of his troubles I hope continued Uncle
John reflectively He wrote me once that his wife had nearly driven
him crazy Perhaps she murdered him in his sleepeh Louise

Sir said Louise much offended you are speaking of my mother

Ah yes Its the same one your father spoke of he answered
unmoved But thats neither here nor there The fact is Ive found
two nieces looking shrewdly from one face into the other and I
seem to be in luck for youre quite pretty and ladylike my dears

Thank you said Louise rather coldly Youre a competent judge
sir I suppose

Tolerable he responded with a chuckle So good a judge that Ive
kep single all my life

Where did you come from asked the girl

From out on the coast tossing his grizzled head toward the west

What brought you back here after all these years

Family affection I guess Wanted to find out what folks yet belonged
to me

An awkward silence followed this during which Uncle John relighted
his pipe and Beth sat in moody silence Louise drew a pattern in the
gravel with the end of her parasol This new uncle she reflected
might become an intolerable bore if she encouraged his frank
familiarity

Now that you are here she said presently what are you going to
do

Nothing my dear

Have you any money

He looked at her with a droll expression

Might have expected that question my dear said he but its
rather hard to answer If I say no youll be afraid Ill want to
borrow a little spendin money now an then and if I say yes youll
take me for a Rockyfeller

Not exactly smiled Louise

Well then if I figure close I wont have to borrow he responded
gravely And heres Jane my sister just rolling in wealth that she
dont know what to do with And shes invited me to stay a while So
lets call the money question settled my dear

Another silence ensued Louise had satisfied her curiosity concerning
her new uncle and Beth had never had any There was nothing more to
say and as Uncle John showed no intention of abandoning the arbored
seat it was evident they must go themselves Louise was about to rise
when the man remarked

Jane wont last long

You think not she asked

She says shes half dead aready and I believe it Its about time
you know Shes let her temper and restless disposition wear her out
Pretty soon shell blow out like a candle All that worries her is to
keep alive until she can decide who to leave her money to Thats why
youre here I spose my dears How do you like being on exhibition
an goin through your paces like a bunch o trotting hosses to see
which is worth the most

Uncle John said Beth I had hoped I would like you But if you are
going to be so very disagreeable Ill have nothing more to do with
you

With this she arose and marched up the path vastly indignant and
Louise marched beside her At the bend in the walk they glanced back
and saw Uncle John sitting upon the bench all doubled up and shaking
with silent laughter

Hes a queer old man said Beth flushing but hes impudent and
half a fool

Dont judge hastily Beth replied Louise reflectively I cant
make up my mind just yet whether Uncle John is a fool or not

Anyhow snapped Beth hes laughing at us

And that said her cousin softly is the strongest evidence of his
sanity Beth my love Aunt Jane has placed us in a most ridiculous
position

That evening at dinner they met Uncle John again seated opposite Aunt
Jane in the great dining hall The mistress of Elmhurst always dressed
for this meal and tonight she wore a rich black silk and had her
invalid chair wheeled to her place at the head of the table Uncle
John had simply changed his old black necktie for a soiled white one
Otherwise his apparel was the same as before and his stubby gray hair
was in a sad state of disarray But his round face wore a cheerful
smile nevertheless and Aunt Jane seemed not to observe anything
outre in her brothers appearance And so the meal passed pleasantly
enough

After it was finished Uncle John strolled into the garden to smoke his
pipe under the stars and Louise sang a few songs for Aunt Jane in the
dimlylit drawing room Beth who was a music teachers daughter
could not sing at all

It was some time later when John Merrick came to his sisters room to
bid her good night

Well she asked him what do you think of the girls

My nieces

Yes

During my lifetime said the old man Ive always noticed that
girls are just girlsand nothing more Jane your sex is a puzzle
that aint worth the trouble solving Youre all alike and what
little Ive seen of my nieces convinces me theyre regulation
femalesno better nor worse than their kind

Louise seems a capable girl declared Aunt Jane musingly I didnt
care much for her at first but she improves on acquaintance She has
been well trained by her mother and is very ladylike and agreeable

Shes smarter than the other one but not so honest said Uncle
John

Beth has no tact at all replied Aunt Jane But then shes younger
than Louise

If youre trying to figure out what they are and what they are not
returned the man youve got a hard job on your hands Jane and like
as not youll make a mistake in the end Wheres the other niece
Arent there three of them

Yes The others coming Silas Watson my lawyer has just
telegraphed from New York that hes bringing Patricia back with him

Had to send for her eh

Yes Shes Irish and if I remember rightly her father is a
disgraceful old reprobate who caused poor Violet no end of worry The
girl may be like him for she wrote me a dreadful letter scolding me
because I hadnt kept her parents supplied with money and refusing to
become my guest

But shes changed her mind

I sent Watson after her and hes bringing her I wanted to see what
the girl is like

Uncle John whistled a few bars of an ancient tune

My advice is he said finally to let em draw cuts for Elmhurst
If you want to leave your money to the best o the lot youre as sure
of striking it right that way as any other

Nonsense said Jane Merrick sharply I dont want to leave my
money to the best of the lot

No

By no means I want to leave it to the one I preferwhether shes
the best or not

I see Jane Ill repeat my former observation Your sex is a puzzle
that isnt worth solving Good night old girl

Good night John




CHAPTER XIII

THE OTHER NIECE


Patricia sat down opposite her Aunt Jane She still wore her hat and
the gray wrap

Well here I am she exclaimed with a laugh but whether I ought
to be here or not I have my doubts

Aunt Jane surveyed her critically

Youre a queer little thing she said bluntly I wonder why I took
so much trouble to get you

So do I returned Patsy her eyes twinkling Youll probably be
sorry for it

Lawyer Watson who had remained standing now broke in nervously

I explained to Miss Doyle said he that you were ill and wanted
to see her And she kindly consented to come to Elmhurst for a few
days

You see said Patsy Id just got Daddy away on his vacation to
visit his old colonel Ive wanted him to go this three years back
but he couldnt afford it until I got a raise this Spring Hell have
a glorious old time with the colonel and theyll fish and hunt and
drink whiskey all day and fight the war all over again every evening
So I was quite by myself when Mr Watson came to me and wouldnt take
no for his answer

Why did you object to come here asked Aunt Jane

Well I didnt know you and I didnt especially want to know you
Not that I bear grudges understand although youve been little of a
friend to my folks these past years But you are rich and proudand I
suspect youre a little cross Aunt Janewhile we are poor and proud
and like to live our lives in our own way

Are you a working girl enquired Miss Merrick

Surely said Patsy and drawing a big lump of salary every Saturday
night Im a hairdresser you knowand by the way Aunt Jane it
puzzles me to find a certain kink in your hair that I thought Id
invented myself

Louise dressed my hair this way said Miss Merrick a bit stiffly

Your maid

My niece Louise Merrick

Patsy whistled and then clapped her hand over her mouth and looked
grave

Is she here she asked a moment later

Yes and your other cousin Elizabeth De Graf is here also

Thats just the trouble cried Patsy energetically Thats why I
didnt want to come you know

I dont understand you Patricia

Why its as plain as the nose on your face even if I hadnt pumped
Mr Watson until I got the truth out of him You want us girls here
just to compare us with each other and pick out the one you like
best

Well

The others youll throw over and the favorite will get your money

Havent I a right to do that asked the invalid in an amazed tone

Perhaps you have But we may as well understand each other right
now Aunt Jane I wont touch a penny of your money under any
circumstances

I dont think you will Patricia

The girl laughed with a joyous infectious merriment that was hard to
resist

Stick to that aunt and theres no reason we shouldnt be friends
she said pleasantly I dont mind coming to see you for it will
give me a bit of a rest and the country is beautiful just now More
than that I believe I shall like you Youve had your own way a long
time and youve grown crochetty and harsh and disagreeable but there
are good lines around your mouth and eyes and your natures liable to
soften and get sunny again Im sure I hope so So if youd like me
to stay a few days Ill take off my things and make myself at home
But Im out of the race for your money and Ill pay my way from now
on just as I have always done

Silas Watson watched Aunt Janes face during this speech with an
anxious and halffrightened expression upon his own No one but
himself had ever dared to talk to Jane Merrick as plainly as this
before and he wondered how she would accept such frankness from a
young girl

But Patricias manner was not at all offensive Her big eyes were
as frank as her words but they glistened with kindliness and good
nature and it was evident the girl had no doubt at all of her aunts
reply for she straightway begun to take off her hat

The invalid had kept her eyes sternly fastened upon her young niece
ever since the beginning of the interview Now she reached out a hand
and touched her bell

Misery she said to the old housekeeper show my niece Miss
Patricia to the rose chamber And see that she is made comfortable

Thank you said Patsy jumping up to go

Make yourself perfectly free of the place continued Aunt Jane in
an even tone turning to Patricia and have as good a time as you
can Im afraid its rather stupid here for girls but that cant be
helped Stay as long as you please and go home whenever you like but
while you are here if you ever feel like chatting with a harsh
and disagreeable old woman come to me at any time and you will be
welcome

Patsy standing before her looked down into her worn face with a
pitying expression

Ah Ive been cruel to you she exclaimed impulsively and I
didnt mean to hurt you at all Aunt Jane You must forgive me Its
just my blunt Irish way you see but if I hadnt been drawn to you
from the first I wouldnt have said a wordgood or bad

Go now replied Aunt Jane turning in her chair rather wearily But
come to me again whenever you like

Patsy nodded and followed the housekeeper to the rose chamberthe
prettiest room old Elmhurst possessed with broad windows opening
directly upon the finest part of the garden

Lawyer Watson sat opposite his old friend for some moments in
thoughtful silence The child is impossible he said at last

You think so she enquired moodily

Absolutely Either of the others would make a better Lady of
Elmhurst Yet I like the little thing I confess She quite won my old
heart after I had known her for five minutes But money would ruin
her Shes a child of the people and ought not to be raised from her
proper level Jane Janeyoure making a grave mistake in all this
Why dont you do the only right thing in your power and leave
Elmhurst to Kenneth

You bore me Silas she answered coldly The boy is the most
impossible of all

It was the old protest and the old reply He had hardly expected
anything different

After a period of thought he asked

What is this I hear about John Merrick having returned from the
West

He came yesterday It was a great surprise to me

I never knew this brother I believe

No he had gone away before I became acquainted with either you or
Tom

What sort of a man is he

Honest and simple hardheaded and experienced

Is he independent

I believe so he has never mentioned his affairs to me But he has
worked hard all his life he says and now means to end his days
peacefully John is not especially refined in his manner nor did he
have much of an education but he seems to be a good deal of a man
for all that I am very glad he appeared at Elmhurst just at this
time

You had believed him dead

Yes He had passed out of my life completely and I never knew what
became of him

He must be an eccentric person said Mr Watson with a smile

He is she acknowledged But blood is thicker than water Silas
and Im glad brother John is here at last

A little later the lawyer left her and picked his way through the
gardens until he came to Kenneths wing and the stair that led to
his room Here he paused a moment finding himself surrounded by a
profound stillness broken only by the chirping of the birds in the
shrubbery Perhaps Kenneth was not in He half decided to retrace
his steps but finally mounted the stair softly and stood within the
doorway of the room

The boy and a little stout man were playing chess at a table and both
were in a deep study of the game The boys back was toward him but
the man observed the newcomer and gave a nod Then he dropped his eyes
again to the table

Kenneth was frowning sullenly

Youre bound to lose the pawn whichever way you play said the
little man quietly

The boy gave an angry cry and thrust the table from him sending the
chessmen clattering into a corner Instantly the little man leaned
over and grasped the boy by the collar and with a sudden jerk landed
him across his own fat knees Then while the prisoner screamed and
struggled the man brought his hand down with a slap that echoed
throughout the room and continued the operation until Master Kenneth
had received a sound spanking

Then he let the boy slip to the floor from whence he arose slowly and
backed toward the door scowling and muttering angrily

You broke the bargain and I kept my word said Uncle John calmly
taking his pipe from his pocket and filling it The compact was that
if you raised a roughhouse like you did yesterday and got unruly
that Id give you a good thrashing Now wasnt it

Yes acknowledged the boy

Well that blamed temper o yourn got away with you again and
youre well spanked for not heading it off Pick up the board Ken my
lad and lets try it again

The boy hesitated Then he looked around and saw Lawyer Watson who
had stood motionless by the doorway and with a cry that was half a
sob Kenneth threw himself into his old friends arms and burst into a
flood of tears

Uncle John struck a match and lighted his pipe

A bargains a bargain he observed composedly

He whipped me sobbed the boy He whipped me like a child

Your own fault said Uncle John You wanted me to play a game with
you and I agreed providin you behaved yourself And you didnt
Now look here Do you blame me any

No said the boy

No harms done is there

No

Then stop blubberin and introduce me to your friend continued
Uncle John Names Watson aint it

Silas Watson sir at your service said the lawyer smiling And
this must be John Merrick who I understand has arrived at Elmhurst
during my absence

Exactly said Uncle John and the two men shook hands cordially

Glad to welcome you to Elmhurst sir continued the lawyer Ive
known it ever since I was a boy when it belonged to my dear friend
Thomas Bradley And I hope youll love it as much as I do when you
know it better

Bradley must have been a fool to give this place to Jane said Uncle
John reflectively

He was in love sir observed the other and they both smiled Then
the lawyer turned to Kenneth How are things going he asked Have
the girls bothered you much as yet

No said the boy I keep out of their way

Thats a good idea By the bye sir turning to John Merrick Ive
just brought you a new niece

Patricia

She prefers to be called Patsy A queer little thing half Irish you
know

And half Merrick Thats an odd combination but the Irish may be
able to stand it said Uncle John These nieces are more than I
bargained for I came to see one relative and find three moreand
all women

I think youll like Patsy anyhow And so will you Kenneth

The boy gave an indignant roar

I hate all girls he said

You wont hate this one Shes as wild and impulsive as you are but
better natured Shell make a good comrade although she may box your
ears once in a while

The boy turned away sulkily and began picking up the scattered
chessmen The two men walked down the stair and strolled together
through the garden

A strange boy said Uncle John presently

Im glad to see youve made friends with him replied the lawyer
earnestly Until now he has had no one to befriend him but me and at
times hes so unmanageable that it worries me dreadfully

Theres considerable character about the lad said John Merrick
but hes been spoiled and allowed to grow up wild like a weed Hes
got it in him to make a criminal or a gentleman whichever way his
nature happens to develop

He ought to go to a military school replied Lawyer Watson Proper
training would make a man of Kenneth but I cant induce Jane to spend
the money on him She gives him food and clothing and lodgingall
of the simplest descriptionbut there her generosity ends With
thousands of dollars lying idle she wont assist the only nephew of
Tom Bradley to secure a proper education

Janes queer too said that ladys brother with a sigh In fact
Mr Watson its a queer world and the longer I live in it the
queerer I find it Once I thought it would be a good idea to regulate
things myself and run the world as it ought to be run but I gave it
up long ago The worlds a stage they say but the show aint always
amusing by a long chalk and sometimes I wish I didnt have a
reserved seat




CHAPTER XIV

KENNETH IS FRIGHTENED


Lawyer Watson unable to direct events at Elmhurst became a silent
spectator of the little comedy being enacted there and never
regretted that as Uncle John expressed it he had a reserved seat at
the show

Jane Merrick formerly the most imperious and irrascible of women had
become wonderfully reserved since the arrival of her nieces and was
evidently making a sincere effort to study their diverse characters
Day by day the invalids health was failing visibly She had no more
strokes of paralysis but her left limb did not recover and the
numbness was gradually creeping upward toward her heart

Perhaps the old woman appreciated this more fully than anyone else At
any event she became more gentle toward Phibbs and Misery who mostly
attended her and showed as much consideration as possible for her
nieces and her brother Silas Watson she kept constantly by her side
He was her oldest and most trusted friend and the only differences
they had ever had were over the boy Kenneth whom she stubbornly
refused to favor

Uncle John speedily became an established fixture at the place The
servants grew accustomed to seeing him wander aimlessly about the
grounds his pipe always in his mouth his hands usually in his
pockets He had a pleasant word always for Donald or Oscar or James
but was not prone to long conversations Every evening when he
appeared at dinner he wore his soiled white tie at other times
the black one was always in evidence but other than this his dress
underwent no change Even Kenneth came to wonder what the bundle had
contained that Uncle John brought under his arm to Elmhurst

The little man seemed from the first much attracted by his three
nieces Notwithstanding Louises constant snubs and Beths haughty
silence he was sure to meet them when they strolled out and try to
engage them in conversation It was hard to resist his simple good
nature and the girls came in time to accept him as an inevitable
companion and Louise mischievously poked fun at him while Beth
conscientiously corrected him in his speech and endeavored to improve
his manners All this seemed very gratifying to Uncle John He thanked
Beth very humbly for her kind attention and laughed with Louise when
she ridiculed his pudgy round form and wondered if his bristly gray
hair wouldnt make a good scrubbing brush

Patsy didnt get along very well with her cousins From the first
when Louise recognized her with well assumed surprise as the girl
who had been sent to dress her hair Patricia declared that their
stations in life were entirely different

Theres no use of our getting mixed up just because were cousins
and all visiting Aunt Jane she said One of you will get her money
for Ive told her I wouldnt touch a penny of it and she has told me
I wouldnt get the chance So one of you will be a great lady while I
shall always earn my own living Ill not stay long anyhow so just
forget Im here and Ill amuse myself and try not to bother you

Both Beth and Louise considered this very sensible and took Patricia
at her word Moreover Phibbs had related to Beth whose devoted
adherent she was all of the conversation between Aunt Jane and
Patricia from which the girls learned they had nothing to fear from
their cousins interference So they let her go her way and the three
only met at the state dinners which Aunt Jane still attended in
spite of her growing weakness

Old Silas Watson interested as he was in the result found it hard to
decide after ten days which of her nieces Jane Merrick most favored
Personally he preferred that Beth should inherit and frankly told his
old friend that the girl would make the best mistress of Elmhurst
Moreover all the servants sang Beths praises from Misery and Phibbs
down to Oscar and Susan Of course James the gardener favored no one
as the numerous strangers at Elmhurst kept him in a constant state of
irritation and his malady seemed even worse than usual He avoided
everyone but his mistress and although his work was now often
neglected Miss Merrick made no complaint James peculiarities were
well understood and aroused nothing but sympathy

Louise however had played her cards so well that all Beths friends
were powerless to eject the elder girl from Aunt Janes esteem Louise
had not only returned the check to her aunt but she came often to sit
beside her and cheer her with a budget of new social gossip and no
one could arrange the pillows so comfortably or stroke the tired head
so gently as Louise And then she was observing and called Aunt
Janes attention to several ways of curtailing the household
expenditures which the womans illness had forced her to neglect

So Miss Merrick asked Louise to look over the weekly accounts and in
this way came to depend upon her almost as much as she did upon Lawyer
Watson

As for Patsy she made no attempt whatever to conciliate her aunt who
seldom mentioned her name to the others but always brightened visibly
when the girl came into her presence with her cheery speeches and
merry laughter She never stayed long but came and went like a
streak of sunshine whenever the fancy seized her and Silas Watson
shrewdly looking on saw a new light in Janes eyes as she looked
after her wayward irresponsible niece and wondered if the bargain
between them regarding the money would really hold good

It was all an incomprehensible problem this matter of the
inheritance and although the lawyer expected daily to be asked to
draw up Jane Merricks will and had indeed prepared several forms
to be used in case of emergency no word had yet passed her lips
regarding her intentions

Kenneths life during this period was one of genuine misery It
seemed to his morbid fancy that whatever path he might take he was
sure of running upon one or more of those detestable girls who were
visiting at Elmhurst Even in Donalds harnessroom he was not secure
from interruption for little Patsy was frequently perched upon the
bench there watching with serious eyes old Donalds motions and
laughing joyously when in his embarrassment he overturned a can of oil
or buckled the wrong straps together

Worse than all this trying creature would saddle Nora the sorrel
mare and dash away through the lanes like a tomboy leaving him
only old Sam to ridefor Donald would allow no one to use the coach
horses Sam was tall and boney and had an unpleasant gait so that
the boy felt he was thoroughly justified in hating the girl who so
frequently interfered with his whims

Louise was at first quite interested in Kenneth and resolved to force
him to talk and become more sociable

She caught him in a little summerhouse one morning from whence
there being but one entrance he could not escape and at once entered
into conversation

Ah you are Kenneth Forbes I suppose she began pleasantly I
am very glad to make your acquaintance I am Louise Merrick Miss
Merricks niece and have come to visit her

The boy shrank back as fur as possible staring her full in the face
but made no reply

You neednt be afraid of me continued Louise Im very fond of
boys and you must be nearly my own age

Still no reply

I suppose you dont know much of girls and are rather shy she
persisted But I want to be friendly and I hope youll let me
Theres so much about this interesting old place that you can tell me
having lived here so many years Come Ill sit beside you on this
bench and well have a good talk together

Go away cried the boy hoarsely raising his hands as if to ward
off her approach

Louise looked surprised and pained

Why we are almost cousins she said Cannot we become friends and
comrades

With a sudden bound he dashed her aside so rudely that she almost
fell and an instant later he had left the summer house and disappear
among the hedges

Louise laughed at her own discomfiture and gave up the attempt to make
the boys acquaintance

Hes a regular savage she told Beth afterward and a little
crazy too I suspect

Never mind said Beth philosophically Hes only a boy and
doesnt amount to anything anyway After Aunt Jane dies he will
probably go somewhere else to live Dont let us bother about him

Kenneths one persistent friend was Uncle John He came every day
to the boys room to play chess with him and after that one days
punishment which singularly enough Kenneth in no way resented they
got along very nicely together Uncle John was a shrewd player of the
difficult game but the boy was quick as a flash to see an advantage
and use it against his opponent so neither was ever sure of winning
and the interest in the game was constantly maintained At evening
also the little man often came to sit on the stair outside the boys
room and smoke his pipe and frequently they would sit beneath the
stars absorbed in thought and without exchanging a single word

Unfortunately Louise and Beth soon discovered the boys secluded
retreat and loved to torment him by entering his own bit of garden
and even ascending the stairs to his little room He could easily
escape them by running through the numerous upper halls of the
mansion but here he was liable to meet others and his especial dread
was encountering old Miss Merrick So he conceived a plan for avoiding
the girls in another way

In the hallway of the left wing near his door was a small ladder
leading to the second story roof and a dozen feet from the edge of
the roof stood an old oak tree on the further side of a tall hedge
Kenneth managed to carry a plank to the roof where after several
attempts he succeeded in dropping one end into a crotch of the oak
thus connecting the edge of the roof with the tree by means of the
narrow plank After this at first sight of the girls in his end of
the garden he fled to the roof ran across the improvised bridge
shinned down the tree and hidden by the hedge made good his
escape

The girls discovered this plan and were wicked enough to surprise the
boy often and force him to cross the dizzy plank to the tree Having
frightened him away they would laugh and stroll on highly amused at
the evident fear they aroused in the only boy about the place

Patricia who was not in the other girls secret knew nothing of this
little comedy and really disturbed Kenneth least of the three But he
seemed to avoid her as much as he did the others

She sooned learned from Oscar that the boy loved to ride as well as
she did and once or twice she met him on a lonely road perched on top
of big Sam This led her to suspect she had thoughtlessly deprived him
of his regular mount So one morning she said to the groom

Doesnt Kenneth usually ride Nora

Yes Miss answered the man

Then Id better take Sam this morning she decided

But the groom demurred

You wont like Sam Miss he said and he gets ugly at times and
acts bad Master Kenneth wont use Nora today Im sure

She hesitated

I think Ill ask him said she after a moment and turned away into
the garden anxious to have this plausible opportunity to speak to the
lonely boy




CHAPTER XV

PATSY MEETS WITH AN ACCIDENT


Get out of here shouted the boy angrily as Patsy appeared at the
foot of his stair

I wont she answered indignantly Ive come to speak to you about
the mare and youll just treat me decently or Ill know the reason
why

But he didnt wait to hear this explanation He saw her advancing up
the stairs and fled in his usual hasty manner to the hall and up the
ladder to the roof

Patsy stepped back into the garden vexed at his flight and the next
instant she saw him appear upon the sloping roof and start to run
down the plank

Even as she looked the boy slipped fell headlong and slid swiftly
downward In a moment he was over the edge clutching wildly at the
plank which was a foot or more beyond his reach Headforemost he
dove into space but the clutching hand found something at lastthe
projecting hook of an old eavestrough that had long since been
removedand to this he clung fast in spite of the jerk of his
arrested body which threatened to tear away his grip

But his plight was desperate nevertheless He was dangling in space
the hard pavement thirty feet below him with no possible way of
pulling himself up to the roof again And the hook was so small that
there was no place for his other hand The only way he could cling
to it at all was to grasp his wrist with the free hand as a partial
relief from the strain upon his arm

Hold fast called Patsy Im coming

She sprang up the steps through the boys room and into the hallway
There she quickly perceived the ladder and mounted it to the roof
Taking in the situation at a glance she ran with steady steps down
the sloping roof to where the plank lay and stepped out upon it far
enough to see the boy dangling beside her Then she decided instantly
what to do

Hang on she called and returning to the roof dragged the end of
the plank to a position directly over the hook Then she lay flat upon
it an arm on either side of the plank and reaching down seized one
of the boys wrists firmly in each hand

Now then said she let go the hook

If I do answered the boy his white face upturned to hers Ill
drag you down with me

No you wont Im very strong and Im sure I can save you Let go
she said imperatively

Im not afraid to die replied the boy his voice full of
bitterness Take away your hands and Ill drop

But Patsy gripped him more firmly than ever

Dont be a fool she cried Theres no danger whatever if you do
just what I tell you

His eyes met hers in a mute appeal but suddenly he gained confidence
and resolved to trust her In any event he could not cling to the
hook much longer

He released his hold and swung in midair just beneath the plank
where the girl lay holding him by his wrists

Now then she said quietly when I lift you up grab the edges of
the plank

Patricias strength was equal to her courage and under the excitement
of that desperate moment she did what few other girls of her size
could ever have accomplished She drew the boy up until his eager
hands caught the edges of the plank and gripped it firmly Then she
released him and crept a little back toward the roof

Now swing your legs up and youre safe she cried

He tried to obey but his strength was failing him and he could do no
more than touch the plank with his toes

Once more called the girl

This time she caught his feet as they swung upward and drew his legs
around the plank

Can you climb up now she asked anxiously

Ill try he panted

The plank upon which this little tragedy was being enacted was in full
view of the small garden where Aunt Jane loved to sit in her chair and
enjoy the flowers and the sunshine She could not see Kenneths wing
at all but she could see the elevated plank leading from the roof to
the oak tree and for several days had been puzzled by its appearance
and wondered for what purpose it was there

Today as she sat talking with John Merrick and Silas Watson she
suddenly gave a cry of surprise and following her eyes the two men
saw Kenneth step out upon the roof fall and slide over the edge
For a moment all three remained motionless seized with fear and
consternation and then they saw Patsy appear and run down to the
plank

This they watched her move and saw her lie down upon it

Shes trying to save himhe must be caught somewhere cried the
lawyer and both men started at full speed to reach the spot by the
roundabout paths through the garden

Aunt Jane sat still and watched Suddenly the form of the boy swung
into view beneath the plank dangling from the girls outstretched
arms The woman caught her breath wondering what would happen next
Patricia drew him up until he seized the plank with his hands Then
the girl crept back a little and as the boy swung his feet upward she
caught them and twined his legs over the plank

And now came the supreme struggle The girl could do little more to
help him He must manage to clamber upon the top of the plank himself

Ordinarily Kenneth might have done this easily but now his nerves
were all unstrung and he was half exhausted by the strain of the past
few minutes Almost he did it but not quite The next effort would be
even weaker But now Patricia walked out upon the plank and Aunt Jane
saw her lean down grasp the boys collar and drag him into a position
of safety

Bravely done she murmured but even as the sound came from her lips
the girl upon the bridge seemed in the exertion of the struggle to
lose her balance She threw out her arms leaned sidewise and then
fell headlong into the chasm and disappeared from view

Aunt Janes agonized scream brought Phibbs running to her side At
a glance she saw that her mistress had fainted and looking hastily
around to discover the cause she observed the boy crawl slowly across
the plank reach the tree and slide down its trunk to pass out of
view behind the high hedge

Drat the boy growled the old servant angrily hell be the death
of Miss Jane yet




CHAPTER XVI

GOOD RESULTS


Uncle John could not run so swiftly as the lawyer but he broke
through a gap in the hedge and arrived at a point just beneath the
plank at the same time that Silas Watson did

One glance showed them the boy safely perched on top of the plank
but the girl was bending backward She threw out her arms in a vain
endeavor to save herself and with a low cry toppled and plunged
swiftly toward the ground

There was little time for the men to consider their actions
Involuntarily they tried to catch Patricia whose body struck them
sharply felling them to the ground and then bounded against the
hedge and back to the pavement

When half dazed they scrambled to their feet the girl lay
motionless before them a stream of red blood welling from a deep cut
in her forhead her eyes closed as if in sleep

A moment more and the boy was kneeling beside her striving to stay
the bleeding with his handkerchief

Do something For Gods sake try to do something he wailed
piteously Cant you see shes killed herself to save me

Uncle John knelt down and took the still form in his arms

Quiet my lad he said She isnt dead Get Nora and fetch the
doctor as soon as you can

The boy was gone instantly his agony relieved by the chance of
action and followed by the lawyer Uncle John carried his niece to
the rose chamber and laid her upon her white bed

Misery met them then and following her came Louise and Beth full of
horror and pity for the victim of the dreadful accident

Jane Merrick had promptly recovered consciousness for fainting spells
were foreign to her nature Her first words to Phibbs who was bending
over her were

Is she dead

Who Miss Jane

Patricia

I dont know Miss Jane Why should she be dead

Run you idiot Run at once and find out Ask my brotherask
anyoneif Patricia is dead

And so Phibbs came to the rose chamber and found the little group
bending over the girls unconscious form

Is she dead sir Miss Jane wants to know said the old servant in
awestruck tones

No answered Uncle John gravely She isnt dead Im sure but I
cant tell how badly she is hurt One of her legsthe right oneis
broken I know for I felt it as I carried the child in my arms but
we must wait until the doctor comes before I can tell more

Misery was something of a nurse it seemed and with the assistance of
Louise who proved most helpful in the emergency she bathed the
wound in the girls forehead and bandaged it as well as she was able
Between them the women also removed Patricias clothing and got her
into bed where she lay white and still unconscious but breathing so
softly that they knew she was yet alive

The doctor was not long in arriving for Kenneth forced him to leap
upon Noras back and race away to Elmhurst while the boy followed as
swiftly as he could on the doctors sober cob

Dr Eliel was only a country practitioner but his varied experiences
through many years had given him a practical knowledge of surgery
and after a careful examination of Patricias injuries he was able to
declare that she would make a fine recovery

Her leg is fractured and shes badly bruised he reported to Aunt
Jane who sent for him as soon as he could leave the sick room But I
do not think she has suffered any internal injuries and the wound on
her forehead is a mere nothing So with good care I expect the young
lady to get along nicely

Do everything you can for her said the woman earnestly You shall
be well paid Dr Eliel

Before Patricia recovered her senses the doctor had sewn up her
forehead and set the fractured limb so that she suffered little pain
from the first

Louise and Beth hovered over her constantly ministering to every
possible want and filled with tenderest sympathy for their injured
cousin The accident seemed to draw them out of their selfishness and
petty intrigues and discovered in them the true womanly qualities that
had lurked beneath the surface

Patsy was not allowed to talk but she smiled gratefully at her
cousins and the three girls seemed suddenly drawn nearer together
than any of them would have thought possible a few hours before

The boy paced constantly up and down outside Patricias door begging
everyone who left the room for news of the girls condition All his
reserve and fear of women seemed to have melted away as if by magic
Even Beth and Louise were questioned eagerly and they having learned
the story of Patricias brave rescue of the boy were very gentle with
him and took pains not to frighten or offend him

Toward evening Louise asked Patricia if she would see Kenneth for a
moment and the girl nodded a ready assent

He came in awkward and trembling glancing fearfully at the bandaged
forehead and the still white face But Patricia managed to smile
reassuringly and held out a little hand for him to take The boy
grasped it in both his own and held it for several minutes while he
stood motionless beside her his wide eyes fixed intently upon her
own

Then Louise sent him away and he went to his room and wept profusely
and then quieted down into a sort of dull stupor

The next morning Uncle John dragged him away from Patricias door and
forced him to play chess The boy lost every game being inattentive
and absorbed in thought until finally Uncle John gave up the attempt
to amuse him and settled himself on the top stair for a quiet smoke
The boy turned to the table and took a sheet of paper from the
drawer For an hour perhaps neither of these curious friends spoke
a word but at the end of that time Uncle John arose and knocked the
ashes from his pipe Kenneth did not notice him The man approached
the table and looked over the boys shoulder uttering an exclamation
of surprise Upon the paper appeared a cleverly drawn pencil sketch
of Patricia lying in her bed a faint smile upon her face and her big
blue eyes turned pleasantly upon a shadowy form that stood beside her
holding her hand The likeness was admirable and if there were faults
in the perspective and composition Uncle John did not recognize them

He gave a low whistle and turned thoughtfully away and the young
artist was so absorbed that he did not even look up

Strolling away to the stables Uncle John met old Donald who
enquired

How is Miss Patsy this morning sir It was the name she had given
and preferred to be called by

Shes doing finely said Uncle John

A brave girl sir

Yes Donald

And the boy

Why he seems changed in some way Donald Not so nervous and wild
as usual you know Ive just left him drawing a picture Curious A
good picture too

Ah he can do that sir as well as a real artist

Have you known him to draw before this

Why hes always at it sir in his quieter moods Ive got a rare
good likeness o myself as he did long ago in the harnessroom

May I see it

With pleasure sir

Donald led the way to the harnessroom and took from the cupboard the
precious board he had so carefully preserved

Uncle John glanced at it and laughed aloud He could well appreciate
the humor of the sketch which Donald never had understood and the
caricature was as clever as it was amusing He handed the treasure
back to Donald and went away even more thoughtful than before

A few days later a large package arrived at Elmhurst addressed to
Kenneth Forbes and Oscar carried it at once to the boys room who
sat for an hour looking at it in silent amazement Then he carefully
unwrapped it and found it to contain a portable easel a quantity of
canvas and drawingpaper paints and oils of every description
mostly all unknown to him and pencils brushes and water colors in
profusion

Kenneths heart bounded with joy Here was wealth indeed greater
than he had ever hoped for He puzzled his brain for weeks to discover
how this fairy gift had ever come to him but he was happier in its
possession than he had ever been before in all his life

Patricia improved rapidly Had it not been for the broken leg she
would have been out of the house in a week as good as ever but
broken limbs take time to heal and Dr Eliel would not permit the
girl to leave her bed until ten days had passed

Meantime everyone delighted to attend her Louise and Beth sat with
her for hours reading or working for the rose chamber was cheery and
pleasant and its big windows opened upon the prettiest part of the
gardens The two girls were even yet suspicious of one another each
striving to win an advantage with Aunt Jane but neither had the
slightest fear that Patricia would ever interfere with their plans So
they allowed their natural inclinations to pet and admire the heroine
of the hour full sway and Patsy responded so sweetly and frankly to
their advances that they came to love her dearly and wondered why
they had not discovered from the first how lovable their Irish cousin
could be

Kenneth also came daily to the sick room for a visit and Patsy had
a way of drawing the boy out and making him talk that was really
irresistible After his fairy gift arrived he could not help telling
the girls all about it and then he brought the things down and
displayed them and promised Patsy he would make a picture of the
garden for her

Then after the girl got better he brought his easel down to her
room where she could watch him work and began upon the picture
while the cousins joined him in speculations as to who the mysterious
donor could he

At first said Kenneth I thought it was Mr Watson for hes alway
been very good to me but he says he knows nothing about it Then I
though it might be Uncle John but Uncle John is too poor to afford
such an expensive present

I dont believe he has a penny in the world said Louise who sat by
with some needlework

All he owns remarked Beth with a laugh is an extra necktie
slightly damaged

But hes a dear old man said Patsy loyally and Im sure he would
have given all those things to Kenneth had he been able

Then who was it asked the boy

Why Aunt Jane to be sure declared Patsy

The boy scowled and shook his head

She wouldnt do anything to please me even to save her life he
growled She hates me I know that well enough

Oh no Im sure she doesnt said Patsy Aunt Jane has a heap
of good in her but youve got to dig for it like you do for gold
Twould be just like her to make you this present and keep it a
secret

If she really did it replied the boy slowly and it seems as if
she is the only one I know who could afford such a gift it stands to
reason that either Uncle John or Mr Watson asked her to and she did
it to please them Ive lived here for years and she has never spoken
a kindly word to me or done me a kindly act It isnt likely shed
begin now is it

Unable to make a reassuring reply Patsy remained silent and the boy
went on with his work He first outlined the picture in pencil and
then filled it in with water color They all expressed admiration for
the drawing but the color effect was so horrible that even Patsy
found no words to praise it and the boy in a fit of sudden anger tore
the thing to shreds and so destroyed it

But I must have my picture anyhow said the girl Make it in pen
and ink or pencil Ken and Im sure it will be beautiful

You need instruction to do water color properly suggested Louise

Then I can never do it he replied bitterly But he adopted Patsys
suggestion and sketched the garden very prettily in pen and ink
By the time the second picture was completed Patsy had received
permission to leave her room which she did in Aunt Janes secondbest
wheel chair

Her first trip was to Aunt Janes own private garden where the
invalid who had not seen her niece since the accident had asked her
to come

Patsy wanted Kenneth to wheel her but the boy with a touch of his
old surly demeanor promptly refused to meet Jane Merrick face to
face So Beth wheeled the chair and Louise walked by Patsys side and
soon the three nieces reached their aunts retreat

Aunt Jane was not in an especially amiable mood

Well girl how do you like being a fool she demanded as Patsys
chair came to a stand just opposite her own

It feels so natural that I dont mind it replied Patsy laughing

You might have killed yourself and all for nothing continued the
old woman querulously

Patsy looked at her pityingly Her aunts face had aged greatly in the
two weeks and the thin gray hair seemed now almost white

Are you feeling better dear asked the girl

I shall never be better said Jane Merrick sternly The end is not
far off now

Oh Im sorry to hear you say that said Patsy but I hope it is
not true Why here are we four newly found relations all beginning to
get acquainted and to love one another and we cant have our little
party broken up auntie dear

Five of usfive relations cried Uncle John coming around the
corner of the hedge Dont I count Patsy you rogue Why youre
looking as bright and as bonny as can be I wouldnt be surprised if
you could toddle

Not yet she answered cheerfully But Im doing finely Uncle
John and it wont be long before I can get about as well as ever

And to think said Aunt Jane bitterly that all this trouble was
caused by that miserable boy If I knew where to send him hed not
stay at Elmhurst a day longer

Why hes my best friend aunt announced Patsy quietly I dont
think I could be happy at Elmhurst without Kenneth

He has quite reformed said Louise and seems like a very nice
boy

Hes a little queer yet at times added Beth but not a bit rude
as he used to be

Aunt Jane looked from one to the other in amazement No one had
spoken so kindly of the boy before in years And Uncle John with a
thoughtful look on his face said slowly

The fact is Jane youve never given the boy a chance On the
contrary you nearly ruined him by making a hermit of him and giving
him no schooling to speak of and no society except that of servants
He was as wild as a hawk when I first came but these girls are just
the sort of companions he needs to soften him and make him a man
Ive no doubt hell come out all right in the end

Perhaps youd like to adopt him yourself John sneered the woman
furious at this praise of the one person she so greatly disliked

Her brother drew his hands from his pockets looked around in a
helpless and embarrassed way and then tried fumblingly to fill his
pipe

I aint in the adopting business Jane he answered meekly And if
I was with a quaint smile Id adopt one or two of these nieces o
mine instead of Tom Bradleys nephew If Bradley hadnt seen you
Jane and loved your pretty face when you were young Kenneth Forbes
would now be the owner of Elmhurst Did you ever think of that

Did she ever think of it Why it was this very fact that made the boy
odious to her The woman grew white with rage

John Merrick leave my presence

All right Jane

He stopped to light his pipe and then slowly walked away leaving an
embarrassed group behind him

Patsy however was equal to the occasion She began at once to
chatter about Dr Eliel and the scar that would always show on her
forehead and how surprised the Major her father would be when he
returned from the visit to his colonel and found his daughter had been
through the wars herself and bore the evidence of honorable wounds
Louise gracefully assisted her cousin to draw Aunt Jane into a more
genial mood and between them they presently succeeded The interview
that had begun so unfortunately ended quite pleasantly and when
Patricia returned to her room her aunt bade her adieu almost tenderly

In fact said Louise to Beth in the privacy of the latters
chamber Im getting rather worried over Aunt Janes evident weakness
for our Cousin Patsy Once or twice today I caught a look in her eye
when she looked at Patsy that she has never given either you or me
The Irish girl may get the money yet

Nonsense said Beth She has said she wouldnt accept a penny of
it and Im positive shell keep her word





CHAPTER XVII

AUNT JANES HEIRESS


Silas said Aunt Jane to her lawyer the next morning after her
interview with Patsy Im ready to have you draw up my will

Mr Watson gave a start of astonishment In his own mind he had
arrived at the conclusion that the will would never be executed and
to have Miss Merrick thus suddenly declare her decision was enough to
startle even the lawyers natural reserve

Very well Jane he said briefly

They were alone in the invalids morning room Phibbs having been
asked to retire

There is no use disguising the fact Silas that I grow weaker every
day and the numbness is creeping nearer and nearer to my heart said
Miss Merrick in her usual even tones It is folly for me to trifle
with these few days of grace yet allowed me and I have fully made up
my mind as to the disposition of my property

Yes he said enquiringly and drew from his pocket a pencil and
paper

I shall leave to my niece Louise five thousand dollars

Yes Jane jotting down the memorandum

And to Elizabeth a like sum

The lawyer seemed disappointed He tapped the pencil against his
teeth musingly for a moment and then wrote down the amount

Also to my brother John Merrick the sum of five thousand dollars
she resumed

To your brother

Yes That should be enough to take care of him as long as he lives
He seems quite simple in his tastes and he is an old man

The lawyer wrote it down

All my other remaining property both real and personal I shall
leave to my niece Patricia Doyle

Jane

Did you hear me

Yes

Then do as I bid you Silas Watson

He leaned back in his chair and looked at her thoughtfully

I am not only your lawyer Jane I am also your friend and
counsellor Do you realize what this bequest means he asked gently

It means that Patricia will inherit Elmhurstand a fortune besides
Why not Silas I liked the child from the first Shes frank and open
and brave and will do credit to my judgment

She is very young and unsophisticated said the lawyer and of all
your nieces she will least appreciate your generosity

You are to be my executor and manage the estate until the girl comes
of age You will see that she is properly educated and fitted for her
station in life As for appreciation or gratitude I dont care a
snap of my finger for such folderol

The lawyer sighed

But the boy Jane You seem to have forgotten him he said

Drat the boy Ive done enough for him already

Wouldnt Tom like you to provide for Kenneth in some way however
humbly

She glared at him angrily

How do you know what Tom would like after all these years she
asked sternly And how should I know either The money is mine and
the boy is nothing to me Let him shift for himself

There is a great deal of money Jane declared the lawyer
impressively We have been fortunate in our investments and you have
used but little of your ample income To spare fifty thousand dollars
to Kenneth who is Toms sole remaining relative would be no hardship
to Patricia Indeed she would scarcely miss it

You remind me of something Silas she said looking at him with
friendly eyes Make a memorandum of twenty thousand dollars to Silas
Watson You have been very faithful to my interests and have helped
materially to increase my fortune

Thank you Jane

He wrote down the amount as calmly as he had done the others

And the boy he asked persistently

Aunt Jane sighed wearily and leaned against her pillows

Give the boy two thousand she said

Make it ten Jane

Ill make it five and not a penny more she rejoined Now leave
me and prepare the paper at once I want to sign it today if
possible

He bowed gravely and left the room

Toward evening the lawyer came again bringing with him a notary from
the village Dr Eliel who had come to visit Patricia was also
called into Jane Merricks room and after she had carefully read the
paper in their presence the mistress of Elmhurst affixed her signature
to the document which transferred the great estate to the little Irish
girl and the notary and the doctor solemnly witnessed it and retired

Now Silas said the old woman with a sigh of intense relief I
can die in peace

Singularly enough the signing of the will seemed not to be the end
for Jane Merrick but the beginning of an era of unusual comfort On
the following morning she awakened brighter than usual having passed
a good night freed from the worries and anxieties that had beset her
for weeks She felt more like her old self than at any time since the
paralysis had overtaken her and passed the morning most enjoyably
in her sunshiney garden Here Patricia was also brought in her wheel
chair by Beth who then left the two invalids together

They conversed genially enough for a time until an unfortunate
remark of Aunt Janes which seemed to asperse her fathers character
aroused Patricias ire Then she loosened her tongue and in her
voluable Irish way berated her aunt until poor Phibbs stood aghast at
such temerity and even Mr Watson who arrived to enquire after his
client and friend was filled with amazement

He cast a significant look at Miss Merrick who answered it in her
usual emphatic way

Patricia is quite right Silas she declared and I deserve all
that she has said If the girl were fond enough of me to defend me as
heartily as she does her father I would be very proud indeed

Patricia cooled at once and regarded her aunt with a sunny smile

Forgive me she begged I know you did not mean it and I was wrong
to talk to you in such a way

So harmony was restored and Mr Watson wondered more and more at
this strange perversion of the old womans character Heretofore any
opposition had aroused in her intense rage and a fierce antagonism
but now she seemed delighted to have Patsy fly at her and excused the
girls temper instead of resenting it

But Patsy was a little ashamed of herself this morning realizing
perhaps that Aunt Jane had been trying to vex her just to enjoy her
indignant speeches and she also realized the fact that her aunt was
old and suffering and not wholly responsible for her aggravating and
somewhat malicious observations So she firmly resolved not to be so
readily entrapped again and was so bright and cheery during the next
hour that Aunt Jane smiled more than once and at one time actually
laughed at her nieces witty repartee

After that it became the daily program for Patsy to spend her mornings
in Aunt Janes little garden and although they sometimes clashed
and as Phibbs told Beth had dreadful fights they both enjoyed
these hours very much

The two girls became rather uneasy during the days their cousin spent
in the society of Aunt Jane Even the dreadful accounts they received
from Phibbs failed wholly to reassure them and Louise redoubled her
solicitious attentions to her aunt in order to offset the influence
Patricia seemed to be gaining over her

Louise had also become by this time the managing housekeeper of
the establishment and it was certain that Aunt Jane looked upon her
eldest and most competent niece with much favor

Beth with all her friends to sing her praises seemed to make less
headway with her aunt than either of the others and gradually she
sank into a state of real despondency

Ive done the best I could she wrote her mother but Im not as
clever as Louise nor as amusing as Patricia so Aunt Jane pays little
attention to me Shes a dreadful old woman and I cant bring myself
to appear to like her That probably accounts for my failure but I
may as well stay on here until something happens

In a fortnight more Patricia abandoned her chair and took to crutches
on which she hobbled everywhere as actively as the others walked She
affected her cousins society more from this time and Aunt Janes
society less for she had come to be fond of the two girls who had
nursed her so tenderly and it was natural that a young girl would
prefer to be with those of her own age rather than a crabbed old woman
like Aunt Jane

Kenneth also now became Patsys faithful companion for the boy had
lost his former bashfulness and fear of girls and had grown to feel
at ease even in the society of Beth and Louise The four had many
excursions and picnics into the country together but Kenneth and
Patsy were recognized as especial chums and the other girls did not
interfere in their friendship except to tease them occasionally in a
good natured way

The boys old acquaintances could hardly recognize him as the same
person they had known before Patricias adventure on the plank His
fits of gloomy abstraction and violent bursts of temper had alike
vanished or only prevailed at brief intervals Nor was he longer rude
and unmannerly to those with whom he came in contact Awkward he still
was and lacking in many graces that education and good society can
alone confer but he was trying hard to be as he confided to old
Uncle John like other people and succeeded in adapting himself
very well to his new circumstances

Although he had no teacher as yet he had begun to understand color
a little and succeeded in finishing one or two watercolor sketches
which Patsy who knew nothing at all of such things pronounced
wonderfully fine Of course the boy blushed with pleasure and was
encouraged to still greater effort

The girl was also responsible for Kenneths sudden advancement in the
household at Elmhurst

One day she said calmly to Aunt Jane

Ive invited Kenneth to dinner this evening

The woman flew angry in an instant

Who gave you such authority she demanded

No one I just took it said Patsy saucily

He shall not come declared Aunt Jane sternly Ill have no
interference from you Miss with my household arrangements Phibbs
call Louise

Patsys brow grew dark Presently Louise appeared

Instruct the servants to forbid that boy to enter my dining room this
evening she said to Louise

Also Louise said Patsy tell them not to lay a plate for me and
ask Oscar to be ready with the wagon at five oclock Im going home

Louise hesitated and looked from Miss Jane to Patsy and back again
They were glaring upon each other like two gorgons

Then she burst into laughter she could not help it the sight was too
ridiculous A moment later Patsy was laughing too and then Aunt Jane
allowed a grim smile to cross her features

Never mind Louise she said with remarkable cheerfulness Well
compromise matters

How asked Patsy

By putting a plate for Kenneth said her aunt cooly I imagine I
can stand his society for one evening

So the matter was arranged to Patricias satisfaction and the boy
came to dinner trembling and unhappy at first but soon placed at
ease by the encouragements of the three girls Indeed he behaved so
well in the main and was so gentle and unobstrusive that Aunt Jane
looked at him with surprise and favored him with one or two speeches
which he answered modestly and well

Patsy was radiant with delight and the next day Aunt Jane remarked
casually that she did not object to the boys presence at dinner at
all and he could come whenever he liked

This arrangement gave great pleasure to both Uncle John and Mr
Watson the latter of whom was often present at the state dinner
and both men congratulated Patsy upon the distinct victory she had
won No more was said about her leaving Elmhurst The Major wrote that
he was having a splendid time with the colonel and begged for an
extension of his vacation to which Patsy readily agreed she being
still unable on account of her limb to return to her work at Madam
Bornes

And so the days glided pleasantly by and August came to find a happy
company of young folks at old Elmhurst with Aunt Jane wonderfully
improved in health and Uncle John beaming complacently upon everyone
he chanced to meet




CHAPTER XVIII

PATRICIA SPEAKS FRANKLY


It was Lawyer Watsons suggestion that she was being unjust to Beth
and Louise in encouraging them to hope they might inherit Elmhurst
that finally decided Aunt Jane to end all misunderstandings and inform
her nieces of the fact that she had made a final disposition of her
property

So one morning she sent word asking them all into her room and when
the nieces appeared they found Uncle John and the lawyer already
in their aunts presence There was an air of impressive formality
pervading the room although Miss Merricks brother at least was as
ignorant as her nieces of the reason why they had been summoned

Patsy came in last hobbling actively on her crutches although the
leg was now nearly recovered and seated herself somewhat in the rear
of the apartment

Aunt Jane looked into one expectant face after another with curious
interest and then broke the silence by saying gravely but in more
gentle tones than she was accustomed to use

I believe young ladies that you have understood from the first my
strongest reason for inviting you to visit Elmhurst this summer I
am old and must soon pass away and instead of leaving you and
your parents who would be my legitimate heirs to squabble over my
property when I am gone I decided to excute a will bequeathing my
estate to some one who would take proper care of it and maintain it in
a creditable manner I had no personal acquaintance with any of you
but judged that one out of the three might serve my purpose and
therefore invited you all here

By this time the hearts of Louise and Beth were fluttering with
excitement and even Patsy looked interested Uncle John sat a little
apart watching them with an amused smile upon his face and the
lawyer sat silent with his eyes fixed upon a pattern in the rug

In arriving at a decision which I may say I have succeeded in
doing continued Aunt Jane calmly I do not claim to have acted
with either wisdom or discernment I have simply followed my own whim
as I have the right to do and selected the niece I prefer to become
my heiress You cannot accuse of injustice because none of you had a
right to expect anything of me but I will say this that I am well
pleased with all three of you and now wish that I had taken pains to
form your acquaintance earlier in life You might have cheered my old
age and rendered it less lonely and dull

Well said Jane remarked Uncle John nodding his head approvingly

She did not notice the interruption but presently continued

Some days ago I asked my lawyer Mr Watson to draw up my will It
was at once prepared and signed and now stands as my last will and
testament I have given to you Louise the sum of five thousand
dollars

Louise laughed nervously and threw out her hands with an indifferent
gesture

Many thanks Aunt she said lightly

To you Beth continued Miss Merrick I have given the same sum

Beths heart sank and tears forced themselves into her eyes in spite
of her efforts to restrain them She said nothing

Aunt Jane turned to her brother

I have also provided for you John in the sum of five thousand
dollars

Me he exclaimed astounded Why suguration Jane I dont

Silence she cried sternly I expect neither thanks nor protests
If you take care of the money John it will last you as long as you
live

Uncle John laughed He doubled up in his chair and rocked back and
forth shaking his little round body as if he had met with the most
amusing thing that had ever happened in his life Aunt Jane stared
at him while Louise and Beth looked their astonishment but Patsys
clear laughter rang above Uncle Johns gasping chuckles

I hope dear Uncle said she mischievously that when poor Aunt
Jane is gone youll be able to buy a new necktie

He looked at her whimsically and wiped the tears from his eyes

Thank you Jane said the little man to his sister Its a lot of
money and Ill be proud to own it

Why did you laugh demanded Aunt Jane

I just happened to think that our old Dad once said Id never be
worth a dollar in all my life What would he say now Jane if he knew
I stood good to have five thousandif I can manage to outlive you

She turned from him with an expression of scorn

In addition to these bequests said she I have left five thousand
to the boy and twenty thousand to Mr Watson The remainder of the
property will go to Patricia

For a moment the room was intensely still Then Patricia said with
quiet determination

You may as well make another will Aunt Ill not touch a penny of
your money

Why not asked the woman almost fiercely

You have been kind to me and you mean well said Patricia I would
rather not tell you my reasons

I demand to know them

Ah aunt cant you understand without my speaking

No said the other but a flush crossed her pale cheek
nevertheless

Patsy arose and stumped to a position directly in front of Jane
Merrick where she rested on her crutches Her eyes were bright and
full of indignation and her plain little face was so white that every
freckle showed distinctly

There was a time years ago she began in a low voice when you
were very rich and your sister Violet my mother was very poor Her
health was bad and she had me to care for while my father was very
ill with a fever She was proud too and for herself she would never
have begged a penny of anyone but for my sake she asked her rich
sister to loan her a little money to tide her over her period of want
What did you do Jane Merrick you who lived in a beautiful mansion
and had more money than you could use You insulted her telling her
she belonged to a family of beggars and that none of them could
wheedle your money away from you

It was true retorted the elder woman stubbornly They were after
me like a drove of wolvesevery Merrick of them alland they would
have ruined me if I had let them bleed me as they wished

So far as my mother is concerned thats a lie said Patsy quietly
She never appealed to you but that once but worked as bravely as she
could to earn money in her own poor way The result was that she died
and I was left to the care of strangers until my father was well
enough to support me

She paused and again the room seemed unnaturally still

Im sorry girl said Aunt Jane at last in trembling tones I was
wrong I see it now and I am sorry I refused Violet

Then I forgive you said Patsy impulsively I forgive you all
Aunt Jane for through your own selfishness you cut yourself off from
all your familyfrom all who might have loved youand you have lived
all these years a solitary and loveless life Therell be no grudge
of mine to follow you to the grave Aunt Jane But her voice
hardening Ill never touch a penny of the money that was denied my
poor dead mother Thank God the old Dad and I are independent and can
earn our own living

Uncle John came to where Patsy stood and put both arms around her
pressing hercrutches and allclose to his breast Then he released
her and without a word stalked from the room

Leave me now said Aunt Jane in a husky voice I want time to
think

Patricia hobbled forward placed one hand caressingly upon the gray
head and then bent and kissed Aunt Janes withered cheek

Thats right she whispered Think it over dear Its all past
and done now and Im sorry I had to hurt you Butnot a penny
auntremember not a penny will I take

Then she left the room followed by Louise and Beth both of whom were
glad to be alone that they might conquer their bitter disappointment

Louise however managed to accept the matter philosophically as the
following extract from her letter to her mother will prove

After all it isnt so bad as it might be mater dear she wrote
Ill get five thousand at the very worst and that will help us on
our way considerably But I am quite sure that Patsy means just what
she says and that she will yet induce Aunt Jane to alter her will In
that case I believe the estate will either be divided between Beth and
me or I will get it all Anyway I shall stay here and play my best
cards until the game is finished




CHAPTER XIX

DUPLICITY


Aunt Jane had a bad night as might have been expected after her
trials of the previous day

She sent for Patricia early in the forenoon and when the girl arrived
she was almost shocked by the change in her aunts appearance The
invalids face seemed drawn and gray and she lay upon her cushions
breathing heavily and without any appearance of vitality or strength
Even the sharpness and piercing quality of her hard gray eyes was
lacking and the glance she cast at her niece was rather pleading than
defiant

I want you to reconsider your decision of yesterday Patricia she
begun

Dont ask me to do that aunt replied the girl firmly My mind is
fully made up

I have made mistakes I know continued the woman feebly but I
want to do the right thing at last

Then I will show you how said Patricia quickly You mustnt think
me impertinent aunt for I dont mean to be so at all But tell me
why did you wish to leave me your money

Because your nature is quite like my own child and I admire your
independence and spirit

But my cousins are much more deserving said she thoughtfully
Louise is very sweet and amiable and loves you more than I do while
Beth is the most sensible and practical girl I have ever known

It may be so returned Aunt Jane impatiently but I have left each
a legacy Patricia and you alone are my choice for the mistress of
Elmhurst I told you yesterday I should not try to be just I mean to
leave my property according to my personal desire and no one shall
hinder me This last with a spark of her old vigor

But that is quite wrong aunt and if you desire me to inherit your
wealth you will be disappointed A moment ago you said you wished to
do the right thing at last Dont you know what that is

Perhaps you will tell me said Aunt Jane curiously

With pleasure returned Patsy Mr Bradley left you this property
because he loved you and love blinded him to all sense of justice
Such an estate should not have passed into the hands of aliens because
of a lovers whim He should have considered his own flesh and blood

There was no one but his sister who at that time was not married and
had no son explained Aunt Jane calmly But he did not forget her
and asked me to look after Katherine Bradley in case she or her heirs
ever needed help I have done so When his mother died I had the boy
brought here and he has lived here ever since

But the property ought to be his said Patricia earnestly It
would please me beyond measure to have you make your will in his
favor and you would be doing the right thing at last

I wont said Aunt Jane angrily

It would also be considerate and just to the memory of Mr Bradley
continued the girl Whats going to became of Kenneth

I have left him five thousand said the woman

Not enough to educate him properly replied Patsy with a shake of
her head Why the boy might become a famous artist if he had good
masters and a person with an artistic temperament such as his
should have enough money to be independent of his art

Aunt Jane coughed unsympathetically

The boy is nothing to me she said

But he ought to have Elmhurst at least pleaded the girl Wont
you leave it to him Aunt Jane

No

Then do as you please cried Patsy flying angry in her turn As a
matter of justice the place should never have been yours and I wont
accept a dollar of the money if I starve to death

Think of your father suggested Aunt Jane cunningly

Ah Ive done that said the girl and I know how many comforts I
could buy for the dear Major Also Id like to go to a girls college
like Smith or Wellesley and get a proper education But not with your
money Aunt Jane It would burn my fingers Always I would think that
if you had not been hard and miserly this same money would have saved
my mothers life No I loathe your money Keep it or throw it to the
dogs if you wont give it to the boy it belongs to But dont you
dare to will your selfish hoard to me

Let us change the subject Patricia

Will you change your will

No

Then I wont talk to you Im angry and hurt and if I stay here Ill
say things I shall be sorry for

With these words she marched out of the room her cheeks flaming and
Aunt Jane looked after her with admiring eyes

Shes right she whispered to herself Its just as Id do under
the same circumstances

This interview was but the beginning of a series that lasted during
the next fortnight during which time the invalid persisted in sending
for Patricia and fighting the same fight over and over again Always
the girl pleaded for Kenneth to inherit and declared she would not
accept the money and Elmhurst and always Aunt Jane stubbornly refused
to consider the boy and tried to tempt the girl with pictures of the
luxury and pleasure that riches would bring her

The interviews were generally short and spirited however and during
the intervals Patsy associated more than ever with her cousins both
of whom grew really fond of her

They fully believed Patricia when she declared she would never accept
the inheritance and although neither Beth nor Louise could understand
such foolish sentimentality they were equally overjoyed at the girls
stand and the firmness with which she maintained it With Patsy out of
the field it was quite possible the estate would be divided between
her cousins or even go entire to one or the other of them and this
hope constantly buoyed their spirits and filled their days with
interest as they watched the fight between their aunt and their
cousin

Patricia never told them she was pleading so hard for the boy It
would only pain her cousins and make them think she was disloyal to
their interests but she lost no opportunity when with her Aunt Jane
of praising Kenneth and proving his ability and finally she seemed to
win her point

Aunt Jane was really worn out with the constant squabbling with her
favorite niece She had taken a turn for the worse too and began to
decline rapidly So her natural cunning and determination to have her
own way enhanced by her illness the woman decided to deceive Patricia
and enjoy her few remaining days in peace

Suppose she said to Mr Watson my present will stands and after
my death the estate becomes the property of Patricia Can she refuse
it

Not legally returned the lawyer It would remain in her name
but under my control during her minority When she became of age
however she could transfer it as she might choose

By that time she will have gained more sense declared Aunt Jane
much pleased with this aspect of the case and it isnt reasonable
that having enjoyed a fortune for a time any girl would throw it away
Ill stick to my point Silas but Ill try to make Patricia believe
she has won me over

Therefore the very next time that the girl pleaded with her to make
Kenneth her heir she said with a clever assumption of resignation

Very well Patricia you shall have your way My only desire child
is to please you as you well know and if you long to see Kenneth the
owner of Elmhurst I will have a new will drawn in his favor

Patricia could scarcely believe her ears

Do you really mean it aunt she asked flushing red with pleasure

I mean exactly what I say and now let us cease all bickerings my
dear and my few remaining days will be peaceful and happy

Patricia thanked her aunt with eager words and said as indeed she
felt that she could almost love Aunt Jane for her final if dilatory
act of justice

Mr Watson chanced to enter the room at that moment and the girl
cried out

Tell him aunt Let him get the paper ready at once

There is no reason for haste said Aunt Jane meeting the lawyers
questioning gaze with some embarrassment

Silas Watson was an honorable and upright man and his clients
frequent doubtful methods had in past years met his severe censure
Yet he had once promised his dead friend Tom Bradley that he would
serve Jane Merrick faithfully He had striven to do so bearing with
her faults of character when he found that he could not correct them
His influence over her had never been very strong however and he had
learned that it was the most easy as well as satisfactory method to
bow to her iron will

Her recent questionings had prepared him for some act of duplicity
but he had by no means understood her present object nor did she mean
that he should So she answered his questioning look by saying

I have promised Patricia that you shall draw a new will leaving
all my estate to Kenneth Forbes except for the bequests that are
mentioned in the present paper

The lawyer regarded her with amazement Then his brow darkened for he
thought she was playing with the girl and was not sincere

Tell him to draw up the paper right away aunt begged Patricia
with sparkling eyes

As soon as you can Silas said the invalid

And aunt cant you spare a little more to Louise and Beth It would
make them so happy

Double the amount I had allowed to each of them the woman commanded
her lawyer

Can it all be ready to sign tonight asked Patsy excitedly

Ill try my dear replied the old lawyer gravely Then he turned
to Jane Merrick

Are you in earnest he asked

Patsys heart suddenly sank

Yes was the reply I am tired of opposing this childs wishes
What do I care what becomes of my money when I am gone All that I
desire is to have my remaining days peaceful

The girl spring forward and kissed her rapturously

They shall be aunt she cried I promise it




CHAPTER XX

IN THE GARDEN


From this hour Patsy devoted herself untiringly to Aunt Jane and
filled her days with as much sunshine as her merry ways and happy
nature could confer Yet there was one thing that rendered her uneasy
the paper that Lawyer Watson had so promptly drawn had never yet been
signed and witnessed Her aunt had allowed her to read it saying she
wished the girl to know she had acted in good faith and Patsy had no
fault at all to find with the document But Aunt Jane was tired and
deferred signing it that evening The next day no witnesses could be
secured and so another postponement followed and upon one pretext or
another the matter was put off until Patricia became suspicious

Noting this Aunt Jane decided to complete her act of deception
She signed the will in the girls presence with Oscar and Susan to
witness her signature Lawyer Watson was not present on this occasion
and as soon as Patsy had left her Miss Merrick tore off the signatures
and burned them wrote void in bold letters across the face of the
paper and then it being rendered of no value she enclosed it in a
large yellow envelope sealed it and that evening handed the envelope
to Mr Watson with the request that it be not opened until after her
death

Patricia in her delight whispered to the lawyer that the paper
was really signed and he was well pleased and guarded the supposed
treasure carefully The girl also took occasion to inform both Beth
and Louise that a new will had been made in which they both profited
largely but she kept the secret of who the real heir was and both
her cousins grew to believe they would share equally in the entire
property

So now an air of harmony settled upon Elmhurst and Uncle John
joined the others in admiration of the girl who had conquered the
stubbornness of her stern old aunt and proved herself so unselfish and
true

One morning Aunt Jane had Phibbs wheel her into her little garden as
usual and busied herself examining the flowers and plants of which
she had always been so fond

James has been neglecting his work lately she said sharply to
her attendant

Hes very queer maam replied old Martha ever since the young
ladies an Master John came to Elmhurst Strangers he never could
abide as you know and he runs and hides himself as soon as he sees
any of em about

Poor James said Miss Merrick recalling her old gardeners
infirmity But he must not neglect my flowers in this way or they
will be ruined

He isnt so afraid of Master John went on Phibbs reflectively as
he is of the young ladies Sometimes Master John talks to James
in his quiet way and Ive noticed he listens to him quite
respectivelylike he always does to you Miss Jane

Go and find James and ask him to step here commanded the mistress
and then guard the opening in the hedge and see that none of my
nieces appear to bother him

Phibbs obediently started upon her errand and came upon James in the
toolhouse at the end of the big garden He was working among his
flower pots and seemed in a quieter mood than usual

Phibbs delivered her message and the gardener at once started
to obey He crossed the garden unobserved and entered the little
enclosure where Miss Janes chair stood The invalid was leaning back
on her cushions but her eyes were wide open and staring

Ive come Miss said James and then getting no reply he looked
into her face A gleam of sunlight filtered through the bushes and
fell aslant Jane Merricks eyes but not a lash quivered

James gave a scream that rang through the air and silenced even the
birds Then shrieking like the madman he was he bounded away through
the hedge sending old Martha whirling into a rosebush and fled as
if a thousand fiends were at his heels

John Merrick and Mr Watson who were not far off aroused by the
bloodcurdling screams ran toward Aunt Janes garden and saw in a
glance what had happened

Poor Jane whispered the brother bending over to tenderly close the
staring eyes her fate has overtaken her unawares

Better so said the lawyer gently She has found Peace at last

Together they wheeled her back into her chamber and called the women
to care for their dead mistress




CHAPTER XXI

READING THE WILL


Aunt Janes funeral was extremely simple and quiet The woman had
made no friends during her long residence in the neighborhood having
isolated herself at the big house and refused to communicate in any
way with the families living near by Therefore although her death
undoubtedly aroused much interest and comment no one cared to be
present at the obsequies

So the minister came from Elmwood and being unable to say much that
was good or bad of the woman who had departed from this vale of
tears he confined his remarks to generalities and made them as brief
as possible Then the body was borne to the little graveyard a mile
away followed by the state carriage containing the three nieces
and Kenneth the drag with Silas Watson and Uncle John the former
driving and then came the Elmhurst carryall with the servants James
did not join these last nor did he appear at the house after
that dreadful scene in the garden He had a little room over the
toolhouse which Jane Merrick had had prepared for him years ago and
here he locked himself in day and night stealthily emerging but to
secure the food Susan carried and placed before his door

No one minded James much for all the inmates of Elhurst were under
severe and exciting strain in the days preceding the funeral

The girls wept a little but it was more on account of the solemnity
following the shadow of death than for any great affection they bore
their aunt Patsy indeed tried to deliver a tribute to Aunt Janes
memory but it was not an emphatic success

Im sure she had a good heart said the girl and if she had lived
more with her own family and cultivated her friends she would have
been much less hard and selfish At the last you know she was quite
gentle

I hadnt noticed it remarked Beth

Oh I did And she made a new will after that awful one she told us
of and tried to be just and fair to all

Im glad to hear that said Louise Tell us Patsy what does the
will say You must know all about it

Mr Watson is going to read it after the funeral replied the girl
and then you will know as much about it as I do I mustnt tell
secrets my dear

So Louise and Beth waited in much nervous excitement for the final
realization of their hopes or fears and during the drive to the
cemetery there was little conversation in the state carriage
Kenneths sensitive nature was greatly affected by the death of the
woman who had played so important a part in the brief story of his
life and the awe it inspired rendered him gloomy and silent Lawyer
Watson had once warned him that Miss Merricks death might make him an
outcast and he felt the insecurity of his present position

But Patsy believing he would soon know of his good fortune watched
him curiously during the ride and beamed upon him as frequently as
her own low spirits would permit

You know Ken she reminded him that whatever happens we are
always to remain friends

Of course replied the boy briefly

The girl had thrown aside her crutches by this time and planned to
return to her work immediately after the funeral

The brief services at the cemetery being concluded the little
cavalcade returned to Elmhurst where luncheon was awaiting them

Then Mr Watson brought into the drawing room the tin box containing
the important Elmhurst papers in his possession and having requested
all present to be seated he said

In order to clear up the uncertainty that at present exists
concerning Miss Merricks last will and testament I will now proceed
to read to you the document which will afterward be properly probated
according to law

There was no need to request their attention An intense stillness
pervaded the room

The lawyer calmly unlocked the tin box and drew out the sealed yellow
envelope which Miss Merrick had recently given him Patsys heart was
beating with eager expectancy She watched the lawyer break the seal
draw out the paper and then turn red and angry He hesitated a moment
and then thrust the useless document into its enclosure and cast it
aside

Is anything wrong asked the girl in a low whisper which was yet
distinctly heard by all

Mr Watson seemed amazed Jane Merricks deceitful trickery
discovered so soon after her death was almost horrible for him to
contemplate He had borne much from this erratic woman but had never
believed her capable of such an act

So he said in irritable tones

Miss Merrick gave me this document a few days ago leading me to
believe it was her last will I had prepared it under her instruction
and understood that it was properly signed But she has herself torn
off and destroyed the signature and marked the paper void so that
the will previously made is the only one that is valid

What do you mean cried Patsy in amazement Isnt Kenneth to
inherit Elmhurst after all

Me Me inherit exclaimed the boy

That is what she promised me declared Patsy while tears of
indignation stood in her eyes I saw her sign it myself and if she
has fooled me and destroyed the signature shes nothing but an old
fraudand Im glad shes dead

With this she threw herself sobbing upon a sofa and Louise and
Beth shocked to learn that after all their cousin had conspired
against them forebore any attempt to comfort her

But Uncle John fully as indignant as Patricia came to her side and
laid a hand tenderly on the girls head

Never mind little one he said Jane was always cruel and
treacherous by nature and we might have expected shed deceive her
friends even in death But you did the best you could Patsy dear
and it cant be helped now

Meantime the lawyer had been fumbling in the box and now drew out the
genuine will

Give me your attention please said he

Patsy sat up and glared at him

I wont take a cent of it she exclaimed

Be silent demanded the lawyer sternly You have all I believe
been told by Miss Merrick of the terms of this will which is properly
signed and attested But it is my duty to read it again from
beginning to end and I will do so

Uncle John smiled when his bequest was mentioned and Beth frowned
Louise however showed no sign of disappointment There had been a
miserable scramble for this inheritance she reflected and she was
glad the struggle was over The five thousand dollars would come in
handy after all and it was that much more than she had expected to
have before she received Aunt Janes invitation Perhaps she and her
mother would use part of it for a European trip if their future plans
seemed to warrant it

As far as I am concerned said Patsy defiantly you may as well
tear up this will too I wont have that shameful old womans money

That is a matter the law does not allow you to decide returned the
lawyer calmly You will note the fact that I am the sole executor of
the estate and must care for it in your interests until you are of
age Then it will he turned over to you to do as you please with

Can I give it away if I want to

Certainly It is now yours without recourse and although you cannot
dispose of it until you are of legal age there will be nothing then
to prevent your transfering it to whomsoever you please I called
Miss Merricks attention to this fact when you refused to accept the
legacy

What did she say

That you would be more wise then and would probably decide to keep
it

Patsy turned impulsively to the boy

Kenneth she said I faithfully promise in the presence of these
witnesses to give you Elmhurst and all Aunt Janes money as soon as I
am of age

Good for you Patsy said Uncle John

The boy seemed bewildered

I dont want the moneyreally I dont he protested The five
thousand she left me will be enough But Id like to live here at
Elmhurst for a time until its sold or some one else comes to live in
the house

Its yours said Patsy with a grand air You can live here
forever

Mr Watson seemed puzzled

If that is your wish Miss Patricia bowing gravely in her
direction I will see that it is carried out Although I am in
this matter your executor I shall defer to your wishes as much as
possible

Thank you she said and then after a moments reflection she
added Cant you give to Louise and Beth the ten thousand dollars
they were to have under the other will instead of the five thousand
each that this one gives them

I will consider that matter he replied perhaps it can be
arranged

Patsys cousins opened their eyes at this and began to regard her
with more friendly glances To have ten thousand each instead of
five would be a very nice thing indeed and Miss Patricia Doyle
had evidently become a young lady whose friendship it would pay to
cultivate If she intended to throw away the inheritance a portion of
it might fall to their share

They were expressing to Patsy their gratitude when old Donald suddenly
appeared in the doorway and beckoned to Uncle John

Will you please come to see James sir he asked The poor fellows
dying




CHAPTER XXII

JAMES TELLS A STRANGE STORY


Uncle John followed the coachman up the stairs to the little room
above the toolhouse where the old man had managed to crawl after old
Sam had given him a vicious kick in the chest

Is he dead he asked

No sir but mortally hurt Im thinkin It must have happened while
we were at the funeral

He opened the door outside which Susan and Oscar watched with
frightened faces and led John Merrick into the room

James lay upon his bed with closed eyes His shirt above the breast
was reeking with blood

The doctor should be sent for said Uncle John

Hell be here soon for one of the stable boys rode to fetch him But
I thought you ought to know at once sir

Quite right Donald

As they stood there the wounded man moved and opened his eyes looking
from one to the other of them wonderingly Finally he smiled

Ah its Donald he said

Yes old friend answered the coachman And this is Mr John

Mr John Mr John I dont quite remember you sir with a slight
shake of the gray head And Donald lad youve grown wonderful old
somehow

Its the years Jeemes was the reply The years make us all old
sooner or later

The gardener seemed puzzled and examined his companions more
carefully He did not seem to be suffering any pain Finally he
sighed

The dreams confuse me he said as if to explain something I cant
always separate them the dreams from the real Have I been sick
Donald

Yes lad Youre sick now

The gardener closed his eyes and lay silent

Do you think hes sane whispered Uncle John

I do sir Hes sane for the first time in years

James looked at them again and slowly raised his hand to wipe the
damp from his forehead

About Master Tom he said falteringly Master Toms dead aint
he

Yes Jeemes

That was real then an no dream I mind it all nowthe shriek of
the whistle the crash and the screams of the dying Have I told you
about it Donald

No lad

It all happened before we knew it I was on one side the car and
Master Tom on the other My side was on top when I came to myself
and Master Tom was buried in the rubbish God knows how I got him out
but I did Donald the poor masters side was crushed in and both
legs splintered I knew at once he was dying when I carried him to
the grass and laid him down and he knew it too Yes the master knew
he was done and him so young and happy and just about to be married
totothe name escapes me lad

His voice sank to a low mumble and he closed his eyes wearily

The watchers at his side stood still and waited It might be that
death had overtaken the poor fellow But no he moved again and
opened his eyes continuing his speech in a stronger tone

It was hard work to get the paper for Master Tom he said but he
swore he must have it before he died I ran all the way to the station
house and backa mile or moreand brought the paper and a pen and
ink besides It was but a telegraph blankall I could find Naught
but a telegraph blank lad

Again his voice trailed away into a mumbling whisper but now Uncle
John and Donald looked into one anothers eyes with sudden interest

He mustnt die yet said the little man and the coachman leaned
over the wounded form and said distinctly

Yes lad Im listening

To be sure said James brightening a bit So I held the paper for
him and the brakeman supported Master Toms poor body and he wrote
out the will as clear as may be

The will

Sure enough Master Toms last will Isnt my name on it too where
I signed it And the conductors beside it for the poor brakeman
didnt dare let him go Of course Who should sign the will with
Master Tom but mehis old servant and friend Am I right Donald

Yes lad

Now says Master Tom take it to Lawyer Watson James and bid him
care for it And give my love to Janethats the name Donald the
one I thought Id forgotand now lay me back and let me die His
very words Donald And we laid him back and he died And he died
Poor Master Tom Poor poor young Master And him tobe marriedin
a

The paper James cried Uncle John recalling the dying man to the
present What became of it

Sir I do not know you answered James suspiciously The papers
for Lawyer Watson Its he alone shall have it

Here I am James cried the lawyer thrusting the others aside and
advancing to the bed Give me the paper Where is it I am Lawyer
Watson

The gardener laugheda horrible croaking laugh that ended with a
gasp of pain

You Lawyer Watson he cried a moment later in taunting tones
Why you old fool Si Watsons as young as Master Tomas young as I
am Youyou Lawyer Watson Ha ha ha

Where is the paper demanded the lawyer fiercely

James stared at him an instant and then suddenly collapsed and fell
back inert upon the bed

Have you heard all asked John Merrick laying his hand on the
lawyers shoulder

Yes I followed you here as soon as I could Tom Bradley made another
will as he lay dying I must have it Mr Merrick

Then you must find it yourself said Donald gravely for James is
dead

The doctor arriving a few minutes later verified the statement
It was evident that the old gardener for years insane had been so
influenced by Miss Merricks death that he had wandered into
the stables where he received his death blow When he regained
consciousness the mania had vanished and in a shadowy way he could
remember and repeat that last scene of the tragedy that had deprived
him of his reason The story was logical enough and both Mr Watson
and John Merrick believed it

Tom Bradley was a levelheaded fellow until he fell in love with your
sister said the lawyer to his companion But after that he would
not listen to reason and perhaps he had a premonition of his own
sudden death for he made a will bequeathing all he possessed to his
sweetheart I drew up the will myself and argued against the folly of
it but he had his own way Afterward in the face of death I believe
he became more sensible and altered his will

Yet James story may all be the effect of a disordered mind said
Uncle John

I do not think so but unless he has destroyed the paper in his
madness we shall he able to find it among his possessions

With this idea in mind Mr Watson ordered the servants to remove the
gardeners body to a room in the carriagehouse and as soon as this
was done he set to work to search for the paper assisted by John
Merrick

It was a telegraph blank he said

Yes

Then we cannot mistake it if we find any papers at all declared
the lawyer

The most likely places in James room for anything to be hidden were a
small closet in which were shelves loaded with odds and ends and an
old clotheschest that was concealed underneath the bed

This last was first examined but found to contain merely an
assortment of old clothing Having tossed these in a heap upon the
floor the lawyer begun an examination of the closet the shelves
promising well because of several bundles of papers they contained

While busy over these he heard Uncle John say quietly

Ive got it

The lawyer bounded from the closet The little man had been searching
the pockets of the clothing taken from the chest and from a faded
velvet coat he drew out the telegraph blank

Is it the will asked the lawyer eagerly

Read it yourself said Uncle John

Mr Watson put on his glasses

Yes this is Tom Bradleys handwriting sure enough The will is
brief but it will hold good in law Listen I bequeath to Jane
Merrick my affianced bride the possession and use of my estate
during the term of her life On her death all such possessions with
their accrument shall be transferred to my sister Katherine Bradley
if she then survives to have and to hold by her heirs and assignees
forever But should she die without issue previous to the death of
Jane Merrick I then appoint my friend and attorney Silas Watson to
distribute the property among such organized and worthy charities as
he may select That is all

Quite enough said Uncle John nodding approval

And it is properly signed and witnessed The estate is Kenneths
sir after all for he is the sole heir of his mother Katherine
Bradley Forbes Hurrah ended the lawyer waving the yellow paper
above his head

Hurrah echoed Uncle John gleefully and the two men shook hands




CHAPTER XXIII

PATSY ADOPTS AN UNCLE


Uncle John and Mr Watson did not appear at dinner being closeted in
the formers room This meal however was no longer a state function
being served by the old servants as a mere matter of routine Indeed
the arrangements of the household had been considerably changed by the
death of its mistress and without any real head to direct them
the servants were patiently awaiting the advent of a new master or
mistress It did not seem clear to them yet whether Miss Patricia or
Lawyer Watson was to take charge of Elmhurst but there were few tears
shed for Jane Merrick and the new regime could not fail to be an
improvement over the last

At dinner the young folks chatted together in a friendly and eager
manner concerning the events of the day They knew of old James
unfortunate end but being unaware of its import gave it but passing
attention The main subject of conversation was Aunt Janes surprising
act in annulling her last will and forcing Patricia to accept the
inheritance when she did not want it Kenneth being at his ease when
alone with the three cousins protested that it would not be right
for Patsy to give him all the estate But as she was so generous
he would accept enough of his Uncle Toms money to educate him as an
artist and provide for himself an humble home Louise and Beth having
at last full knowledge of their cousins desire to increase their
bequests were openly very grateful for her good will although
secretly they could not fail to resent Patsys choice of the boy as
the proper heir of his uncles fortune The balance of power seemed to
be in Patricias hands however so it would be folly at this juncture
to offend her

Altogether they were all better provided for than they had feared
would be the case so the little party spent a pleasant evening and
separated early Beth and Louise to go to their rooms and canvass
quietly the events of the day and the boy to take a long stroll
through the country lanes to cool his bewildered brain Patsy wrote a
long letter to the major telling him she would be home in three days
and then she went to bed and slept peacefully

After breakfast they were all again summoned to the drawingroom to
their great surprise Lawyer Watson and Uncle John were there looking
as grave as the important occasion demanded and the former at once
proceeded to relate the scene in James room his story of the death
of Thomas Bradley and the subsequent finding of the will

This will which has just been recovered continued the lawyer
impressively was made subsequent to the one under which Jane
Merrick inherited and therefore supercedes it Miss Jane had as
you perceive a perfect right to the use of the estate during her
lifetime but no right whatever to will a penny of it to anyone Mr
Bradley having provided for that most fully For this reason the will
I read to you yesterday is of no effect and Kenneth Forbes inherits
from his uncle through his mother all of the estate

Blank looks followed Mr Watsons statement

Goodby to my five thousand said Uncle John with his chuckling
laugh But Im much obliged to Jane nevertheless

Dont we get anything at all asked Beth with quivering lip

No my dear answered the lawyer gently Your aunt owned nothing
to give you

Patsy laughed She felt wonderfully relieved

Wasnt I the grand lady though with all the fortune I never had
she cried merrily But twas really fine to be rich for a day and
toss the money around as if I didnt have to dress ten heads of hair
in ten hours to earn my bread and butter

Louise smiled

It was all a great farce she said I shall take the afternoon
train to the city What an old fraud our dear Aunt Jane was And how
foolish of me to return her hundred dollar check

I used mine said Beth bitterly Its all Ill ever get it
seems And then the thought of the Professor and his debts overcame
her and she burst into tears

The boy sat doubled within his chair so overcome by the extraordinary
fortune that had overtaken him that he could not speak nor think even
clearly as yet

Patsy tried to comfort Beth

Never mind dear said she Were no worse off than before we
came are we And weve had a nice vacation Lets forget all
disappointments and be grateful to Aunt Janes memory As far as she
knew she tried to be good to us

Im going home today said Beth angrily drying her eyes

Well all go home said Patsy cheerfully

For my part remarked Uncle John in a grave voice I have no
home

Patsy ran up and put her arm around his neck

Poor Uncle John she cried Why youre worse off than any of us
Whats going to become of you I wonder

Im wondering that myself said the little man meekly

Ah You can stay here said the boy suddenly arousing from his
apathy

No replied Uncle John the Merricks are out of Elmhurst now and
it returns to its rightful owners You owe me nothing my lad

But I like you said Kenneth and youre old and homeless Stay at
Elmhurst and you shall always be welcome

Uncle John seemed greatly affected and wrung the boys hand
earnestly But he shook his head

Ive wandered all my life he said I can wander yet

See here exclaimed Patsy Were all three your nieces and well
take care of you between us Wont we girls

Louise smiled rather scornfully and Beth scowled

My mother and I live so simply in our little flat said one that
we really havent extra room to keep a cat But we shall be glad to
assist Uncle John as far as we are able

Father can hardly support his own family said the other but I
will talk to my mother about Uncle John when I get home and see what
she says

Oh you dont need to indeed cried Patsy in great indignation
Uncle John is my dear mothers brother and hes to come and live
with the Major and me as long as he cares to Theres room and to
spare Uncle turning to him and clasping his hand and a joyful
welcome into the bargain No no say nothing at all sir Come you
shall if I have to drag you and if you act naughty Ill send for the
Major to punish you

Uncle Johns eyes were moist He looked on Patsy most affectionately
and cast a wink at Lawyer Watson who stood silently by

Thank you my dear said he but wheres the money to come from

Money Bah she said Doesnt the Major earn a heap with his
bookkeeping and havent I had a raise lately Why well be as snug
and contented as pigs in clover Can you get ready to come with me
today Uncle John

Yes he said slowly Ill be ready Patsy

So the exodus from Elmhurst took place that very day and Beth
travelled in one direction while Louise Patsy and Uncle John took
the train for New York Louise had a seat in the parlor car but Patsy
laughed at such extravagance

Its so much easier than walking she said to Uncle John that the
common car is good enough and the old man readily agreed with her

Kenneth and Mr Watson came to the station to see them off and they
parted with many mutual expressions of friendship and good will
Louise especially pressed an urgent invitation upon the new master
of Elmhurst to visit her mother in New York and he said he hoped to
see all the girls again They were really like cousins to him by this
time And after they were all gone he rode home on Noras back quite
disconsolate in spite of his wonderful fortune

The lawyer who had consented to stay at the mansion for a time that
the boy might not be lonely had already mapped put a plan for the
young heirs advancement As he rode beside Kenneth he said

You ought to travel and visit the art centers of Europe and I shall
try to find a competent tutor to go with you

Cant you go yourself asked the boy

The lawyer hesitated

Im getting old and my clients are few and unimportant aside from
the Elmhurst interests he said Perhaps I can manage to go abroad
with you

Id like that declared the boy And wed stop in New York
wouldnt we for a time

Of course Do you want to visit New York especially

Yes

Its rather a stupid city said the lawyer doubtfully

That may be answered the boy But Patsy will be there you know




CHAPTER XXIV

HOME AGAIN


The Major was at the station to meet them Uncle John had shyly
suggested a telegram and Patsy had decided they could stand the
expense for the pleasure of seeing the old Dad an hour sooner

The girl caught sight of him outside the gates his face red and
beaming as a poppy in bloom and his snowy moustache bristling with
eagerness At once she dropped her bundles and flew to the Majors
arms leaving the little man in her wake to rescue her belongings and
follow after

He could hardly see Patsy at all the Major wrapped her in such an
ample embrace but bye and bye she escaped to get her breath and then
her eyes fell upon the meek form holding her bundles

Oh Dad she cried heres Uncle John who has come to live with
us and if you dont love him as much as I do Ill make your life
miserable

On which account said the Major grasping the little mans hand
most cordially Ill love Uncle John like my own brother And
surely he added his voice falling tenderly my dear Violets
brother must be my own Welcome sir now and always to our little
home Its modest sir but wherever Patsy is the sun is sure to
shine

I can believe that said Uncle John with a nod and smile

They boarded a car for the long ride up town and as soon as they were
seated Patsy demanded the story of the Majors adventures with his
colonel and the old fellow rattled away with the eagerness of a
boy telling every detail in the most whimsical manner and finding
something humorous in every incident

Oh but it was grand Patsy he exclaimed and the Colonel wept on
my neck when we parted and stained the collar of me best coat and he
give me a bottle of whiskey that would make a teetotaler roll his eyes
in ecstacy Twas the time of my life

And youre a dozen years younger Major she cried laughing and
fit to dig into work like a pig in clover

His face grew grave

But how about the money Patsy dear he asked Did you get nothing
out of Jane Merricks estate

Not a nickle Dad Twas the best joke you ever knew I fought with
Aunt Jane like a pirate and it quite won her heart When she died she
left me all she had in the world

Look at that now said the Major wonderingly

Which turned out to be nothing at all continued Patsy For another
will was found made by Mr Thomas Bradley which gave the money to
his own nephew after Aunt Jane died Did you ever

Wonderful said the Major with a sigh

So I was rich for half a day and then poor as ever

It didnt hurt you did it asked the Major You werent vexed with
disappointment were you Patsy

Not at all Daddy

Then dont mind it child Like as not the money would be the
ruination of us all Eh sir appealing to Uncle John

To be sure said the little man Jane left five thousand to me
also which I didnt get But Im not sorry at all

Quite right sir approved the Major sympathetically although
its easier not to expect anything at all than to set your heart on a
thing and then not get it In your case it wont matter Our house is
yours and theres plenty and to spare

Thank you said Uncle John his face grave but his eyes merry

Oh Major cried Patsy suddenly Theres Danny Reevess
restaurant Lets get off and have our dinner now Im as hungry as a
bear

So they stopped the car and descended lugging all the parcels into
the little restaurant where they were piled into a chair while the
proprietor and the waiters all gathered around Patsy to welcome her
home

My how her eyes sparkled She fairly danced for joy and ordered the
dinner with reckless disregard of the bill

Ah but its good to be back said the little Bohemian gleefully
The big house at Elmhurst was grand and stately Major but there
wasnt an ounce of love in the cupboard

Wasnt I there Patsy asked Uncle John reproachfully

True but now youre here and our love Uncle has nothing to do
with Elmhurst Ill bet a penny you liked it as little as I did

Youd win admitted the little man

And now said the girl to the smiling waiter a bottle of red
California wine for Uncle John and the Major and two real cigars
Well be merry tonight if it bankrupts the Doyle family entirely

But after a merry meal and a good one there was no bill at all when
it was called for

Danny Reeves himself came instead and made a nice little speech
saying that Patsy had always brought good luck to the place and this
dinner was his treat to welcome her home

So the Major thanked him with gracious dignity and Patsy kissed Danny
on his right cheek and then they went away happy and content to find
the little rooms up the second flight of the old tenement

Its no palace said Patsy entering to throw down the bundles as
soon as the Major unlocked the door but theres a cricket in the
hearth and its your home Uncle John as well as ours

Uncle John looked around curiously The place was so plain after the
comparative luxury of Elmhurst and especially of the rose chamber
Patsy had occupied that the old man could not fail to marvel at the
girls ecstatic joy to find herself in the old tenement again There
was one good sized livingroom with an ancient ragcarpet partially
covering the floor a sheetiron stove a sofa a table and three or
four oldfashioned chairs that had probably come from a secondhand
dealer

Opening from this were two closetlike rooms containing each a bed and
a chair with a washbasin on a bracket shelf On the wails were a
few colored prints from the Sunday newspapers and one large and fine
photograph of a grizzled old soldier that Uncle John at once decided
must represent the Colonel

Having noted these details Patsys uncle smoothed back his stubby
gray hair with a reflective and half puzzled gesture

Its cozy enough my child and I thank you for my welcome said he
But may I enquire where on earth you expect to stow me in this rather
limited establishment

Where Have you no eyes then she asked in astonishment Its the
finest sofa in the world Uncle John and youll sleep there like a
top with the dear Colonels own picture looking down at you to keep
you safe and give you happy dreams Where indeed

Ah I see said Uncle John

And you can wash in my chamber added the Major with a grand air
and hang your clothes on the spare hooks behind my door

I havent many said Uncle John looking thoughtfully at his red
bundle

The Major coughed and turned the lamp a little higher

Youll find the air fine and the neighborhood respectable he said
to turn the subject Our modest apartments are cool in summer and
warm in winter and remarkably reasonable in price Patsy gets our
breakfast on the stove yonder and we buy our lunches down town where
we work and then dine at Danny Reevess place A model home sir and
a happy one as I hope youll find it

Im sure to be happy here said Uncle John taking out his pipe
May I smoke

Of course but dont spoil the lace curtains dear answered Patsy
mischievously And then turning to her father she exclaimed Oh
daddy What will the Uncle do all the day while were at work

Thats as he may choose said the Major courteously

Couldnt we get him a job asked Patsy wistfully Not where
therell be much work you know for the Uncle is old But just to
keep him out of mischief and busy He cant hang around all day and
be happy I suppose

Ill look around answered the Major briskly as if such a job
was the easiest thing in the world to procure And meantime

Meantime said Uncle John smiling at them Ill look around
myself

To be sure agreed the Major Between the two of us and Patsy we
ought to have no trouble at all

There was a moment of thoughtful silence after this and then Patsy
said

You know it wont matter Uncle John if you dont work Therell
easy be enough for all with the Majors wages and my own

By the bye added the Major if you have any money about you which
is just possible sir of course youd better turn it over to Patsy
to keep and let her make you an allowance Thats the way I doits
very satisfactory

The Majors extravagant exclaimed Patsy and if he has money he
wants to treat every man he meets

Uncle John shook his head reproachfully at the Major

A very bad habit sir he said

I acknowledge it Mr Merrick responded the Major But Patsy is
fast curing me And after all its a wicked city to be carrying a
fat pocketbook around in as Ive often observed

My pocketbook is not exactly fat remarked Uncle John

But youve money sir for I marked you squandering it on the train
said Patsy severely So out with it and well count up and see how
much of an allowance I can make you till you get the job

Uncle John laughed and drew his chair up to the table Then he emptied
his trousers pockets upon the cloth and Patsy gravely separated the
keys and jackknife from the coins and proceeded to count the money

Seven dollars and fortytwo cents she announced Any more

Uncle John hesitated a moment and then drew from an inner pocket of
his coat a thin wallet From this when she had received it from his
hand the girl abstracted two ten and one five dollar bills all crisp
and new

Good gracious she cried delightedly All this wealth and you
pleading poverty

I never said I was a pauper returned Uncle John complacently

You couldnt and be truthful sir declared the girl Why this
will last for ages and Ill put it away safe and be liberal with
your allowance Let me see pushing the coins about with her slender
fingers you just keep the fortytwo cents Uncle John Itll do for
carfare and a bit of lunch now and then and when you get broke you
can come to me

He smokes observed the Major significantly

Bah a pipe said Patsy And Bull Durham is only five cents a bag
and a bag ought to last a week And every Saturday night sir you
shall have a cigar after dinner with the Major Its it our regular
practice

Thank you Patsy said Uncle John meekly and gathered up his
fortytwo cents

Youve now a home and a manager sir with money in the bank of
Patsy  Company Limited announced the Major You ought to be very
contented sir

I am replied Uncle John




CHAPTER XXV

UNCLE JOHN ACTS QUEERLY


When Patsy and the Major had both departed for work on Monday morning
Uncle John boarded a car and rode downtown also He might have
accompanied them part of the way but feared Patsey might think him
extravagant if she found him so soon breaking into the working fund of
fortytwo cents which she charged him to be careful of

He seemed to be in no hurry for it was early yet and few of the
lower Broadway establishments were open To pass the time he turned
into a small restaurant and had coffee and a plate of cakes in spite
of the fact that Patsy had so recently prepared coffee over the
sheetiron stove and brought some hot buns from a nearby bakery He
was not especially hungry but in sipping the coffee and nibbling the
cakes he passed the best part of an hour

He smiled when he paid out twentyfive cents of his slender store for
the refreshment With five cents for carfare he had now but twelve
cents left of the fortytwo Patsy had given him Talk about the
Majors extravagance it could not be compared to Uncle Johns

Another hour was spent in looking in at the shop windows Then
suddenly noting the time Uncle John started down the street at a
swinging pace and presently paused before a building upon which was
a sign reading Isham Marvin  Co Bankers and Brokers A
prosperous looking place it seemed with a host of clerks busily
working in the various departments Uncle John walked in although the
uniformed official at the door eyed him suspiciously

Mr Marvin in he inquired pleasantly

Not arrived yet said the official who wore a big star upon his
breast

Ill wait announced Uncle John and sat down upon a leathercovered
bench

The official strutted up and down watching the customers who entered
the bank or departed and keeping a sharp watch on the little man upon
the bench

Another hour passed

Presently Uncle John jumped up and approached the official

Hasnt Mr Marvin arrived yet he enquired sharply

An hour ago was the reply

Then why didnt you let me know I want to see him

Hes busy mornings Has to look over the mail He cant see you yet

Well he will see me and right away Tell him John Merrick is here

Your card sir

I havent any My name will do

The official hesitated and glanced at the little mans seedy garb and
countryfied air But something in the angry glance of the shrewd
eye made him fear he had made a mistake He opened a small door and
disappeared

In a moment the door burst open to allow egress to a big redbearded
man in his shirtsleeves who glanced around briefly and then rushed at
Uncle John and shook both his hands cordially

My dear Mr Merrick he exclaimed Im delighted and honored to see
you here Come to my room at once A great surprise and pleasure sir
Thomas Im engaged

This last was directed at the head of the amazed porter who as the
door slammed in his face nodded solemnly and remarked

Fooled agin and I might a known it Drat these ere billionaires
Why dont they dress like decent people

Uncle John had been advised by Patsy where to go for a good cheap
luncheon but he did not heed her admonition Instead he rode in a
carriage beside the banker to a splendid club where he was served
with the finest dishes the chef could provide on short notice
Moreover Mr Marvin introduced him to several substantial gentlemen
as Mr John Merrick of Portland and each one bowed profoundly and
declared he was highly honored

Yet Uncle John seemed in no way elated by this reception He retained
his simple manner although his face was more grave than Patsy had
often seen it and he talked with easy familiarity of preferred stocks
and amalgamated interests and invested securities and many other
queer things that the banker seemed to understand fully and to listen
to with respectful deference

Then they returned to the bank for another long session together and
there was quite an eager bustle among the clerks as they stretched
their necks to get a glimpse of Mr Marvins companion

Its John Merrick passed from mouth to mouth and the uniformed
official strutted from one window to another saying

I showed him in myself And he came into the bank as quiet like as
anyone else would

But he didnt go away quietly you may be sure Mr Marvin and Mr
Isham both escorted their famous client to the door where the Marvin
carriage had been ordered to be in readiness for Mr Merricks
service

But Uncle John waived it aside disdainfully

Ill walk he said There are some other errands to attend to

So they shook his hand and reminded him of a future appointment and
let him go his way In a moment the great Broadway crowd had swallowed
up John Merrick and five minutes later he was thoughtfully gazing
into a shop window again

By and bye he bethought himself of the time and took a cab uptown He
had more than the twelve cents in his pocket now besides the check
book which was carefully hidden away in an inside pocket so the cost
of the cab did not worry him He dismissed the vehicle near an uptown
corner and started to walk hastily toward Danny Reevess restaurant a
block away Patsy was standing in the doorway anxiously watching for
him

Oh Uncle John she cried as he strolled Ive been really worried
about you its such a big city and you a stranger Do you know
youre ten minutes late

Im sorry he said humbly but its a long way here from
downtown

Didnt you take a car

No my dear

Why you foolish old Uncle Come in at once The Major has been
terribly excited over you and swore you should not be allowed to
wander through the streets without someone to look after you But what
could we do

Im all right declared Uncle John cordially shaking hands with
Patsys father Have you had a good day

Fine said the Major Theyd missed me at the office and were glad
to have me back And what do you think Ive got a raise

Really said Uncle John seeing it was expected of him

For a fact Its Patsys doing Ive no doubt She wheedled the firm
into giving me a vacation and now theyre to pay me twelve a week
instead of ten

Is that enough asked Uncle John doubtfully

More than enough sir Im getting old and cant earn as much as a
younger man But Im pretty tough and mean to hold onto that twelve a
week as long as possible

What pay do you get Patsy asked Uncle John

Almost as much as Daddy Were dreadfully rich Uncle John so you
neednt worry if you dont strike a job yourself all at once

Any luck today sir asked the Major tucking a napkin under his
chin and beginning on the soup

Uncle John shook his head

Of course not said Patsy quickly Its too early as yet Dont
hurry Uncle John Except that itll keep you busy theres no need
for you to work at all

Youre older than I am suggested the Major and that makes it
harder to break in But theres no hurry as Patsy says

Uncle John did not seem to be worrying over his idleness He kept on
questioning his brotherinlaw and his niece about their labors and
afterward related to them the sights he had seen in the shop windows
Of course he could not eat much after the feast he had had at
luncheon and this disturbed Patsy a little She insisted he was
tired and carried her men away to the tenement rooms as soon as
possible where she installed them at the table to play cribbage until
bedtime

The next day Uncle John seemed to be busy enough although of course
Patsy could not know what he was doing He visited a realestate
office for one thing and then telephoned Isham Marvin  Co and
issued a string of orders in a voice not nearly so meek and mild as
it was when he was in Patsys presence Whatever he had undertaken
required time for all during the week he left the tenement directly
the Major and his daughter had gone to the city and bustled about
until it was time to meet them for dinner at the restaurant But he
was happy and in good spirits and enjoyed his evening game of cribbage
with the Major exceedingly

You must be nearly bankrupt by this time said Patsy on Tuesday
evening

Its an expensive city to live in sighed Uncle John

She gave him fifty cents of his money then and on Friday fifty cents
more

After a time she said youll manage to get along with less Its
always harder to economize at first

How about the bills he inquired Dont I pay my share of them

Your expenses are nothing at all declared the Major with a wave of
his hand

But my dinners at Danny Reeves place must cost a lot protested
Uncle John

Surely not Patsy has managed all that for a trifle and the pleasure
of your company more than repays us for the bit of expense

On Saturday night there was a pint of red wine for the two men and
then the weekly cigars were broughtvery inexpensive ones to be
sure The first whiff he took made Uncle John cough but the Major
smoked so gracefully and with such evident pleasure that his
brotherinlaw clung manfully to the cigar and succeeded in consuming
it to the end

Tomorrow is the day of rest announced Patsy so well all go for a
nice walk in the parks after breakfast

And we sleep till eight oclock dont we Patsy asked the Major

Of course

And the eggs for breakfast

Ive bought them already three for a nickle You dont care for more
than one do you Uncle John

No my dear

Its our Sunday morning extraan egg apiece The Major is so fond of
them

And so am I Patsy

And now well have our cribbage and get to bed early Heigho but
Sundays a great day for folks that work




CHAPTER XXVI

A BUNCH OF KEYS


Uncle John did not sleep well Perhaps he had a guilty conscience
Anyway he tossed about a good deal on the sofabed in the
livingroom and wore himself out to such an extent that when Patsy
got up at eight oclock her uncle had fallen into his first sound
sleep

She never disturbed him until she had made the fire and cooked the
coffee and boiled the three white eggs By this time the Major was
dressed and shaved and he aroused Uncle John and bade him hurry into
the closet and make his toilet so that Patsy could put the house to
rights

Uncle John obeyed eagerly and was ready as soon as the Major had
brought the smoking rolls from the bakery Ah but it was a merry
breakfast and a delicious one into the bargain Uncle John seemed
hungry and looked at the empty eggshells regretfully

Next time Patsy he said you must buy six eggs

Look at his recklessness cried Patsy laughing Youre just as bad
as the Major every bit If you men hadnt me for a guardian youd be
in the poorhouse in a month

But we have you my dear said Uncle John smiling into her dancing
eyes so we wont complain at one egg instead of two

Just then someone pounded on the door and the girl ran to open it
There was a messenger boy outside looking smart and neat in his
blueandgold uniform and he touched his cap politely to the girl

Miss Patricia Doyle

Thats me

A parcel for you Sign here please

Patsy signed bothering her head the while to know what the little
package contained and who could have sent it Then the boy was gone
and she came back slowly to the breakfast table with the thing in her
hand

What is it Patsy asked the Major curiously

Im dying to know myself said the girl

Uncle John finished his coffee looking unconcerned

A good way is to open it remarked the Major

It was a very neat package wrapped in fine paper and sealed with red
wax Patsy turned it over once or twice and then broke the wax and
untied the cord

A bunch of keys fell out firstseven of them strung on a purple
ribbonand then a flat impressive looking letter was discovered

The Major stared openmouthed Uncle John leaned back in his chair and
watched the girls face

Theres a mistake said Patsy quite bewildered Then she read her
name upon the wrapper quite plainly written and shook her head
Its for me all right But what does it mean

Why not read the letter suggested the Major

So she opened the big envelope and unfolded the stiff paper and read
as follows

Miss Patricia Doyle Beckers Flats Duggan Street New York Dear
Miss Doyle An esteemed client of our house who desires to remain
unknown has placed at your disposal the furnished apartments D
at  Willing Square for the period of three years or as long
thereafter as you may care to retain them Our client begs you to
consider everything the apartments contain as your own and to use
it freely as it may please you All rentals and rates are paid in
advance and you are expected to take possession at once Moreover
our firm is commanded to serve you in any and every way you may
require and it will be our greatest pleasure to be of use to you The
keys to the apartments are enclosed herewith

Most respectfully

Isham Marvin  Co

Having read this to the end in a weak voice and with many pauses
Miss Patricia Doyle sat down in her chair with strange abruptness and
stared blankly at her father The Major stared back So did Uncle
John when her eyes roved toward his face

Patricia turned the keys over and jingled them Then she referred to
the letter again

Apartments D at  Willing Square Wheres that

The Major shook his head So did Uncle John

Might look in a directory suggested the latter uncertainly

Of course added the Major

But what does it all mean demanded Patsy with sudden fierceness
Is it a joke Isham Marvin  Co the great bankers What do I know
of them or they of me

That isnt the point observed the Major reflectively Whos their
unknown and mysterious client Thats the question

To be sure said Uncle John Theyre only the agents You must have
a fairy godmother Patsy

She laughed at the idea and shook her head

They dont exist in these days Uncle John But the whole thing must
be a joke and nothing more

Well discover that asserted the Major shrewdly scrutinizing
the letter which he had taken from Patsys hands It surely looks
genuine enough on the face of it Ive seen the bank letterhead
before and this is no forgery you can take my word Get your things
on Patsy Instead of walking in the park well hunt up Willing
Square and well take the keys with us

A very good idea said Uncle John Id like to go with you if I
may

Of course you may answered the girl Youre one of the family now
Uncle John and you must help us to unravel the mystery

The Major took off his carpet slippers and pulled on his boots while
Patricia was getting ready for the walk Uncle John wandered around
the room aimlessly for a time and then took off his black tie and put
on the white one

Patsy noticed this when she came out of her closet and laughed
merrily

You mustnt be getting excited Uncle John until we see how this
wonderful adventure turns out she said But I really must wash and
iron that necktie for you if youre going to wear it on Sundays

Not a bad idea said the Major But come are we all ready

They walked down the rickety steps very gravely and sedately Patsy
jingling the keys as they went and made their way to the corner drug
store where the Major searched in the directory for Willing Square

To his surprise it proved to be only a few blocks away

But its in the dead swell neighborhood he explained where I have
no occasion to visit We can walk it in five minutes

Patsy hesitated

Really its no use going Dad she protested It isnt in reason
that Id have a place presented me in a dead swell neighborhood Now
is it

Well have to go just the same said Uncle John I couldnt sleep
a wink tonight if we didnt find out what this all means

True enough agreed the Major Come along Patsy its this way

Willing Square was not very big but it was beautiful with flowers and
well tended and  proved to be a handsome building with a white
marble front situated directly on a corner The Major examined it
critically from the sidewalk and decided it contained six suites of
apartments three on each side

D must be the second floor to the right he said and thats a fine
location sure enough

A porter appeared at the front door which stood open and examined
the group upon the sidewalk with evident curiosity

Patsy walked up to him and ignoring the big gold figures over the
entrance she enquired

Is this  Willing Square

Yes Miss answered the porter are you Miss Doyle

I am she answered surprised

One flight up Miss and turn to the right he continued promptly
and then he winked over the girls head at Uncle John who frowned so
terribly that the man drew aside and disappeared abruptly The Major
and Patsy were staring at one another however and did not see this
byplay

Lets go up said the Major in a husky voice and proceeded to
mount the stairs

Patsy followed close behind and then came Uncle John One flight up
they paused at a door marked D upon the panel of which was a rack
bearing a card printed with the word Doyle

Well well gasped the Major Whod have thought it at all at
all

Patsy with trembling fingers put a key in the lock and after one or
two efforts opened the door

The sun was shining brilliantly into a tiny reception hall furnished
most luxuriously

The Major placed his hat on the rack and Uncle John followed suit

No one spoke a word as they marched in humble procession into the
livingroom their feet pressing without sound into the thick rugs
Everything here was fresh and new but selected with excellent taste
and careful attention to detail Not a thing was lacking from the
pretty upright piano to the enameled clock ticking upon the mantel
The diningroom was a picture indeed with stainedglass windows
casting their soft lights through the draperies and the sideboard
shining with silver and glass There was a cellarette in one corner
the Major noticed and it was well stocked

Beyond was a pantry with well filled shelves and then the
kitchenthis last filled with every article that could possibly
be needed In a storeroom were enough provisions to stock a
grocerystore and Patsy noted with amazement that there was ice in the
refrigerator with cream and milk and butter cooling beside it

They felt now as if they were intruding in some fairy domain It was
all exquisite though rather tiny but such luxury was as far removed
from the dingy rooms they had occupied as could well be imagined The
Major coughed and ahemmed continually Patsy ahd and ohd and seemed
half frightened Uncle John walked after them silently but with a
pleased smile that was almost childish upon his round and rugged face

Across the hall were three chambers each with a separate bath while
one had a pretty dressingroom added

This will be Patsys room said the Major with a vast amount of
dignity

Of course said Uncle John The pins on the cushion spell
Patricia dont they

So they do cried Patsy greatly delighted

And this room continued the Major passing into the next will be
mine There are fine battlescenes on the wall and I declare theres
just the place for the colonels photograph over the dresser

Cigars too said Patsy opening a little cabinet but twill be a
shame to smoke in this palace

Then I wont live here declared the Major stoutly but no one
heeded him

Here is Uncle Johns room exclaimed the girl entering the third
chamber

Mine enquired Uncle John in mild surprise

Sure sir youre one of the family and Im glad its as good as the
Majors every bit

Uncle Johns eyes twinkled

I hope the bed is soft he remarked pressing it critically

Its as good as the old sofa any day said Patsy indignantly

Just then a bell tinkled and after looking at one another in silent
consternation for a moment the Major tiptoed stealthily to the front
door followed by the others

Whatll we do asked Patsy in distress

Better open it suggested Uncle John calmly

The Major did so and there was a little maid bowing and smiling
outside She entered at once closing the door behind her and bowed
again

This is my new mistress I suppose she said looking at Patsy I
am your servant Miss Patricia

Patsy gasped and stared at her The maid was not much older than she
was but she looked pleasant and intelligent and in keeping with the
rooms She wore a gray dress with white collar and white apron and
cap and seemed so dainty and sweet that the Major and Uncle John
approved her at once

Patsy sat down from sheer lack of strength to stand up

Who hired you then she asked

A gentleman from the bank was the reply Im Mary if you please
Miss And my wages are all arranged for in advance so there will be
nothing for you to pay said the little maid

Can you cook asked Patsy curiously

Yes Miss with a smile The dinner will be ready at one oclock

Oh youve been here before then

Two days Miss getting ready for you

And where will you sleep

Ive a little room beyond the kitchen Didnt you see it Miss
Patricia

No Mary

Anything more at present Miss Patricia

No Mary

The maid bowed again and disappeared toward the kitchen leaving an
awestruck group behind her

The Major whistled softly Uncle John seemed quite unconcerned Patsy
took out her handkerchief The tears would come in spite of her
efforts

IIIm going to have a good cry she sobbed and rushed into the
livingroom to throw herself flat upon the divan

Its all right said the Major answering Uncle Johns startled
look the cry will do her good Ive half a mind to join her myself

But he didnt He followed Uncle John into the tatters room and
smoked one of the newlydiscovered cigars while the elder man lay back
in an easy chair and silently puffed his pipe

By and bye Patsy joined them no longer crying but radiant with glee

Tell me Daddy said she perching on the arm of the Majors chair
who gave me all this do you think

Not me answered the Major positively I couldnt do it on twelve
a week anyhow at all

And you robbed me of all my money when I came to town said Uncle
John

Stop joking said the girl Theres no doubt this place is intended
for us is there

None at all declared the Major Its ours for three years and not
a penny to pay

Well then do you think its Kenneth

The Major shook his head

I dont know the lad he said and he might be equal to it
although I doubt it But he cant touch his money till he comes
of age and it isnt likely his lawyer guardian would allow such
extravagances

Then who can it be

I cant imagine

It doesnt seem to matter remarked Uncle John lighting a fresh
pipe Youre not supposed to ask questions I take it but to enjoy
your new home as much as you can

Exactly agreed the Major

Ive been thinking continued Uncle John that Im not exactly fit
for all this style Patsy Ill have to get a new suit of clothes to
match my new quarters Will you give me back ten dollars of that money
to buy em with

I suppose Ill have to she answered thoughtfully

Well have to go back to Beckers flats to pack up our traps said
the Major so we might as well go now

I hate to leave here for a single moment replied the girl

Why

Im afraid it will all disappear again

Nonsense said Uncle John For my part I havent any traps so
Ill stay here and guard the treasure till you return

Dinner is served Miss Patricia said the small maid appearing in
the doorway

Then lets dine cried Patsy clapping her hands gleefully and
afterward the Major and I will make our last visit to Beckers flats




CHAPTER XXVII

LOUISE MAKES A DISCOVERY


Uncle John did not stay to guard the treasure after all for he knew
very well it would not disappear

As soon as Patsy and the Major had departed for Beckers flats he
took his own hat from the rack and walked away to hunt up another
niece Miss Louise Merrick whose address he had casually obtained
from Patsy a day or two before

It was near by and he soon found the placea pretty flat in a
fashionable building although not so exclusive a residence district
as Willing Square

Up three flights he rode in the elevator and then rang softly at the
door which here the card of Mrs Merrick

A maid opened it and looked at him enquiringly

Are the ladies in he asked

Ill see Your card sir

I havent any

She half closed the door

Any name then

Yes John Merrick

She closed the door entirely and was gone several minutes Then she
came back and ushered him through the parlor into a small rear room

Mrs Merrick arose from her chair by the window and advanced to meet
him

You are John Merrick she enquired

Your husbands brother maam he replied

How do you do Uncle John called Louise from the sofa Excuse my
getting up wont you And where in the world have you come from

Mrs Merrick sat down again

Wont you take a chair she said stiffly

I believe I will returned Uncle John I just came to make a call
you know

Louise has told me of you said the lady It was very unfortunate
that your sisters death deprived you of a home An absurd thing
altogether that fiasco of Jane Merricks

True he agreed

But I might have expected it knowing the womans character as I
did

Uncle John wondered what Janes character had to do with the finding
of Tom Bradleys last will but he said nothing

Where are you living asked Louise

Not anywhere exactly he answered although Patsy has offered me
a home and Ive been sleeping on a sofa in her livingroom the past
week

I advise you to stay with the Doyles said Mrs Merrick quickly
We havent even a sofa to offer you here our flat is so small
otherwise we would be glad to be of some help to you Have you found
work

I havent tried to yet maam

It will be hard to get at your age of course But that is a matter
in which we cannot assist you

Oh Im not looking for help maam

She glanced at his worn clothing and soiled white necktie and smiled

But we want to do something for you said Louise Now sitting up
and regarding him gravely Im going to tell you a state secret We
are living in this luxurious way on the principal of my fathers
life insurance At our present rate of expenditure we figure that the
money will last us two years and nine months longer By that time I
shall be comfortably married or we will go bankruptas the fates
decide Do you understand the situation

Perfectly Its very simple said the old man

And rather uncertain isnt it But in spite of this we are better
able to help you than any of your other relatives The Doyles are
hardworking folks and very poor Beth says that Professor De Graf is
over head and ears in debt and earns less every year so he cant be
counted upon In all the Merrick tribe the only tangible thing is my
fathers life insurance which I believe you once helped him to pay a
premium on

Id forgotten that said Uncle John

Well we havent We dont want to appear ungenerous in your eyes
Some day we may need help ourselves But just now we cant offer you a
home and as mother says youd better stay with the Doyles We have
talked of making you a small allowance but that may not be necessary
When you need assistance you must come to us and well do whatever we
can as long as our money lasts Wont that be the better way

Uncle John was silent for a moment Then he asked

Why have you thought it necessary to assist me

Louise seemed surprised

You are old and seemed to be without means she answered and that
five thousand Aunt Jane left to you turned out to be a myth But tell
me have you money Uncle John

Enough for my present needs he said smiling

Mrs Merrick seemed greatly relieved

Then there is no need of our trying to be generous she said and I
am glad of that on all accounts

I just called for a little visit said Uncle John It seemed
unfriendly not to hunt you up when I was in town

Im glad you did replied Mrs Merrick glancing at the clock But
Louise expects a young gentleman to call upon her in a few minutes
and perhaps you can drop in again another Sunday for instance

Perhaps so said Uncle John rising with a red face Ill see

Good bye Uncle exclaimed Louise rising to take his hand Dont
feel that weve hurried you away but come in again whenever you feel
like it

Thank you my dear he said and went away

Louise approached the open window that led to a broad balcony The
people in the next flatyoung Mr Isham the son of the great
banker and his wifewere sitting on the balcony overlooking the
street but Louise decided to glance over the rail to discover if the
young gentleman she so eagerly awaited chanced to be in sight

As she did so Mr Isham cried in great excitement

There he is Myrathats him and pointed toward the sidewalk

Whom enquired Mrs Isham calmly

Why John Merrick John Merrick of Portland Oregon

And who is John Merrick asked the lady

One of the richest men in the world and the best client our house
has Isnt he a queer looking fellow And dresses like a tramp But
hes worth from eighty to ninety millions at least and controls most
of the canning and tinplate industries of America I wonder what
brought him into this neighborhood

Louise drew back from the window pale and trembling Then she caught
up a shawl and rushed from the room Uncle John must be overtaken and
brought back at all hazards

The elevator was coming down fortunately and she descended quickly
and reached the street where she peered eagerly up and down for the
round plump figure of the little millionaire But by some strange
chance he had already turned a corner and disappeared

While she hesitated the young man came briskly up swinging his cane

Why Miss Louise he said in some surprise were you by good
chance waiting for me

No indeed she answered with a laugh Ive been saying goodbye
to my rich uncle John Merrick of Portland who has just called

John Merrick the tinplate magnate Is he your uncle

My fathers own brother she answered gaily Come upstairs
please Mother will be glad to see you




CHAPTER XXVIII

PATSY LOSES HER JOB


Uncle John reached Willing Square before Patsy and her father
returned but soon afterward they arrived in an antiquated carriage
surrounded by innumerable bundles

The drivers a friend of mine explained the Major and he moved us
for fifty cents which is less than half price We didnt bring a bit
of the furniture or beds for theres no place here to put them but
as the rent at Beckers flat is paid to the first of next month well
have plenty of time to auction em all off

The rest of the day was spent most delightfully in establishing
themselves in the new home It didnt take the girl long to put her
few belongings into the closets and drawers but there were a thousand
little things to examine in the rooms and she made some important
discovery at every turn

Daddy she said impressively it must have cost a big fortune to
furnish these little rooms Theyre full of very expensive things and
none of the grand houses Madam Borne has sent me to is any finer than
ours Im sure the place is too good for us who are working people
Do you think we ought to stay here

The Doyles answered the Major very seriously are one of the
greatest and most aristocratic families in all Ireland which is the
most aristocratic country in the world If I only had our pedigree I
could prove it to you easily Theres nothing too good for an Irish
gentleman even if he condescends to bookkeeping to supply the
immediate necessities of life and as youre me own daughter
Patricia though a Merrick on your poor sainted mothers side youre
entitled to all you can get honestly Am I right Uncle John or do I
flatter myself

Uncle John stroked the girls head softly

You are quite right he said There is nothing too good for a
brave honest girl whos heart is in the right place

And thats Patsy declared the Major as if the question were
finally settled

On Monday morning Mary had a dainty breakfast all ready for them at
seven oclock and Patsy and her father departed with light hearts for
their work Uncle John rode part way down town with them

Im going to buy my new suit today and a new necktie he said

Dont let them rob you was Patsys parting injunction Is your
money all safe And if you buy a ten dollar suit of clothes the dealer
ought to throw in the necktie to bind the bargain And see that
theyre all wool Uncle John

What the neckties

No the clothes Goodbye and dont be late to dinner Mary might
scold

Ill remember Goodbye my dear

Patsy was almost singing for joy when she walked into Madam Bornes
hairdressing establishment

Dont take off your things said the Madam sharply Your services
are no longer required

Patsy looked at her in amazement Doubtless she hadnt heard aright

I have another girl in your place continued Madam Borne so Ill
bid you good morning

Patsys heart was beating fast

Do you mean Im discharged she asked with a catch in her voice

Thats it precisely

Have I done anything wrong Madam

It isnt that said Madam pettishly I simply do not require your
services You are paid up to Saturday night and I owe you nothing
Now run along

Patsy stood looking at her and wondering what to do To lose this
place was certainly a great calamity

Youll give me a testimonial wont you Madam she asked
falteringly

I dont give testimonials was the reply

Do run away child Im very busy this morning

Patsy went away all her happiness turned to bitter grief What would
the Major say and what were they to do without her wages Then she
remembered Willing Square and was a little comforted Money was not
as necessary now as it had been before

Nevertheless she applied to one or two hairdressers for employment
and met with abrupt refusals They had all the help they needed So
she decided to go back home and think it over before taking further
action

It was nearly ten oclock when she fitted her passkey into the carved
door of Apartment D and when she entered the pretty livingroom she
found an elderly lady seated there who arose to greet her

Miss Doyle enquired the lady

Yes maam said Patsy

I am Mrs Wilson and I have been engaged to give you private
instruction from ten to twelve every morning

Patsy plumped down upon a chair and looked her amazement

May I ask who engaged you she ventured to enquire

A gentleman from the bank of Isham Marvin  Co made the
arrangement May I take off my things

If you please said the girl quietly Evidently this explained why
Madam Borne had discharged her so heartlessly The gentleman from
Isham Marvin  Co had doubtless interviewed the Madam and told her
what to do And then knowing she would be at liberty he had sent her
this private instructor

The girl felt that the conduct of her life had been taken out of her
own hands entirely and that she was now being guided and cared for by
her unknown friend and benefactor And although she was inclined to
resent the loss of her independence at first her judgment told her
it would not only be wise but to her great advantage to submit

She found Mrs Wilson a charming and cultivated lady who proved so
gracious and kindly that the girl felt quite at ease in her presence
She soon discovered how woefully ignorant Patsy was and arranged a
course of instruction that would be of most benefit to her

I have been asked to prepare you to enter a girls college she
said and if you are attentive and studious I shall easily accomplish
the task

Patsy invited her to stay to luncheon which Mary served in the cosy
diningroom and then Mrs Wilson departed and left her alone to think
over this new example of her unknown friends thoughtful care

At three oclock the doorbell rang and Mary ushered in another
strange persona pretty fairhaired young lady this time who said
she was to give Miss Doyle lessons on the piano

Patsy was delighted It was the one accomplishment she most longed to
acquire and she entered into the first lesson with an eagerness that
made her teacher smile approvingly

Meantime the Major was having his own surprises At the office the
manager met him on his arrival and called him into his private room

Major Doyle said he it is with great regret that we part with
you for you have served our house most faithfully

The Major was nonplussed

But continued the manager our bankers Messers Isham Marvin
 Co have asked us to spare you for them as they have a place
requiring a man of your abilities where you can do much better than
with us Take this card sir and step over to the bankers and enquire
for Mr Marvin I congratulate you Major Doyle on your advancement
which I admit is fully deserved

The Major seemed dazed Like a man walking in a dream he made his way
to the great banking house and sent in the card to Mr Marvin

That gentleman greeted him most cordially

We want you to act as special auditor of accounts said he It is a
place of much responsibility but your duties will not be arduous You
will occupy Private Office No  and your hours are only from 
to  each morning After that you will be at liberty The salary
I regret to say is not commensurate with your value being merely
twentyfour hundred a year but as you will have part of the day to
yourself you will doubtless be able to supplement that sum in other
ways Is this satisfactory sir

Quite so answered the Major Twentyfour hundred a year And only
two hours work Quite satisfactory indeed

His little office was very cosy too and the work of auditing the
accounts of the most important customers of the house required
accuracy but no amount of labor It was an ideal occupation for a man
of his years and limited training

He stayed in the office until two oclock that day in order to get
fully acquainted with the details of his work Then he closed his
desk went to luncheon which he enjoyed amazingly and then decided
to return to Willing Square and await Patsys return from Madam
Bornes

As he let himself in he heard an awkward drumming and strumming on the
piano and peering slyly through the opening in the portierre he was
startled to find Patsy herself making the dreadful noise while a
pretty girl sat beside her directing the movements of her fingers

The Major watched for several minutes in silent but amazed
exultation then he tiptoed softly to his room to smoke a cigar and
wait until his daughter was at liberty to hear his great news and
explain her own adventures

When Uncle John came home to dinner he found father and daughter
seated happily together in a loving embrace their faces wreathed with
ecstatic smiles that were wonderful to behold

Uncle John was radiant in a brand new pepperandsalt suit of clothes
that fitted his little round form perfectly Patsy marvelled that he
could get such a handsome outfit for the money for Uncle John had on
new linen and a new hat and even a redbordered handkerchief for the
coat pocketbesides the necktie and the necktie was of fine silk and
in the latest fashion

The transformation was complete and Uncle John had suddenly become an
eminently respectable old gentleman with very little to criticise in
his appearance

Do I match the flat now he asked

To a dot declared Patsy So come to dinner for its ready and
waiting and the Major and I have some wonderful fairy tales to tell
you




CHAPTER XXIX

THE MAJOR DEMANDS AN EXPLANATION


That was a happy week indeed Patsy devoted all her spare time to her
lessons but the house itself demanded no little attention She would
not let Mary dust the ornaments or arrange the rooms at all but
lovingly performed those duties herself and soon became an ideal
housekeeper as Uncle John approvingly remarked

And as she flitted from room to room she sang such merry songs that it
was a delight to hear her and the Major was sure to get home from the
city in time to listen to the strumming of the piano at three oclock
from the recess of his own snug chamber

Uncle John went to the city every morning and at first this
occasioned no remark Patsy was too occupied to pay much attention to
her uncles coming and going and the Major was indifferent being
busy admiring Patsys happiness and congratulating himself on his own
good fortune

The position at the bank had raised the good mans importance several
notches The clerks treated him with fine consideration and the heads
of the firm were cordial and most pleasant His fine soldierly figure
and kindly whitemoustached face conferred a certain dignity upon
his employers which they seemed to respect and appreciate

It was on Wednesday that the Major encountered the name of John
Merrick on the books The account was an enormous one running into
millions in stocks and securities The Major smiled

Thats Uncle Johns name he reflected It would please him to know
he had a namesake so rich as this one

The next day he noted that John Merricks holdings were mostly in
western canning industries and tinplate factories and again he
recollected that Uncle John had once been a tinsmith The connection
was rather curious

But it was not until Saturday morning that the truth dawned upon him
and struck him like a blow from a sledgehammer

He had occasion to visit Mr Marvins private office but being told
that the gentleman was engaged with an important customer he lingered
outside the door waiting

Presently the door was partly opened

Dont forget to sell two thousand of the Continental stock tomorrow
he heard a familiar voice say

Ill not forget Mr Merrick answered the banker

And buy that property on Bleeker street at the price offered Its a
fair proposition and I need the land

Very well Mr Merrick Would it not be better for me to send these
papers by a messenger to your house

No Ill take them myself No one will rob me And then the door
swung open and chuckling in his usual whimsical fashion Uncle John
came out wearing his saltandpepper suit and stuffing a bundle of
papers into his inside pocket

The Major stared at him haughtily but made no attempt to openly
recognize the man Uncle John gave a start laughed and then walked
away briskly throwing a hasty goodbye to the obsequious banker
who followed him out bowing low

The Major returned to his office with a grave face and sat for the
best part of three hours in a brown study Then he took his hat and
went home

Patsy asked anxiously if anything had happened when she saw his face
but the Major shook his head

Uncle John arrived just in time for dinner in a very genial mood
and he and Patsy kept up a lively conversation at the table while the
Major looked stern every time he caught the little mans eye

But Uncle John never minded He was not even as meek and humble as
usual but laughed and chatted with the freedom of a boy just out of
school which made Patsy think the new clothes had improved him in
more ways than one

When dinner was over the Major led them into the sittingroom turned
up the lights and then confronted the little man with a determined
and majestic air

Sir said he give an account of yourself

Eh

John Merrick millionaire and impostor who came into my family under
false pretenses and won our love and friendship when we didnt know
it give an account of yourself

Patsy laughed

What are you up to Daddy she demanded What has Uncle John been
doing

Deceiving us my dear

Nonsense said Uncle John lighting his old briar pipe youve been
deceiving yourselves

Didnt you convey the impression that you were poor demanded the
Major sternly

No

Didnt you let Patsy take away your thirtytwo dollars and fortytwo
cents thinking it was all you had

Yes

Arent you worth millions and millions of dollarsso many that you
cant count them yourself

Perhaps

Then sir concluded the Major mopping the perspiration from his
forehead and sitting down limply in his chair what do you mean by
it

Patsy stood pale and trembling her round eyes fixed upon her uncles
composed face

Uncle John she faltered

Yes my dear

Is it all true Are you so very rich

Yes my dear

And its you that gave me this house andand everything elseand
got the Major his fine job and me discharged andand

Of course Patsy Why not

Oh Uncle John

She threw herself into his arms sobbing happily as he clasped her
little form to his bosom And the Major coughed and blew his nose and
muttered unintelligible words into his handkerchief Then Patsy sprang
up and rushed upon her father crying

Oh Daddy Arent you glad its Uncle John

I have still to hear his explanation said the Major

Uncle John beamed upon them Perhaps he had never been so happy before
in all his life

Im willing to explain he said lighting his pipe again and
settling himself in his chair But my story is a simple one dear
friends and not nearly so wonderful as you may imagine My father had
a big family that kept him poor and I was a tinsmith with little work
to be had in the village where we lived So I started west working my
way from town to town until I got to Portland Oregon

There was work in plenty there making the tin cans in which salmon
and other fish is packed and as I was industrious I soon had a shop
of my own and supplied cans to the packers The shop grew to be
a great factory employing hundreds of men Then I bought up the
factories of my competitors so as to control the market and as I
used so much tinplate I became interested in the manufacture of this
product and invested a good deal of money in the production and
perfection of American tin My factories were now scattered all along
the coast even to California where I made the cans for the great
quantities of canned fruits they ship from that section every year
Of course the business made me rich and I bought real estate with my
extra money and doubled my fortune again and again

I never married for all my heart was in the business and I thought
of nothing else But a while ago a big consolidation of the canning
industries was effected and the active management I resigned to other
hands because I had grown old and had too much money already

It was then that I remembered the family and went back quietly to
the village where I was born They were all dead or scattered
I found but because Jane had inherited a fortune in some way I
discovered where she lived and went to see her I suppose it was
because my clothes were old and shabby that Jane concluded I was a
poor man and needed assistance and I didnt take the trouble to
undeceive her

I also found my three nieces at Elmhurst and it struck me it would
be a good time to study their characters for like Jane I had a
fortune to leave behind me and I was curious to find out which girl
was the most deserving No one suspected my disguise I dont usually
wear such poor clothes you know but I have grown to be careless of
dress in the west and finding that I was supposed to be a poor man I
clung to that old suit like grim death to a grasshopper

It was very wicked of you said Patsy soberly from her fathers
lap

As it turned out continued the little man Janes desire to leave
her money to her nieces amounted to nothing for the money wasnt
hers But I must say it was kind of her to put me down for five
thousand dollarsnow wasnt it

The Major grinned

And thats the whole story my friends After Janes death you
offered me a homethe best you had to giveand I accepted it I had
to come to New York anyway you know for Isham Marvin  Co have
been my bankers for years and there was considerable business to
transact with them I think thats all isnt it

Then this house is yours said Patsy wonderingly

No my dear the whole block belongs to you and heres the deed for
it drawing a package of papers from his pocket Its a very good
property Patsy and the rents you get from the other five flats will
be a fortune in themselves

For a time the three sat in silence Then the girl whispered softly

Why are you so good to me Uncle John

Just because I like you Patsy and you are my niece

And the other nieces

Well I dont mean they shall wait for my death to be made happy
answered Uncle John Heres a paper that gives to Louises mother the
use of a hundred thousand dollars as long as she lives After that
Louise will have the money to do as she pleases with

How fine cried Patsy clapping her hands joyfully

And heres another paper that gives Professor De Graf the use of
another hundred thousand Beth is to have it when he dies Shes a
sensible girl and will take good care of it

Indeed she will said Patsy

And now said Uncle John I want to know if I can keep my little
room in your apartments Patsy or if youd prefer me to find another
boarding place

Your home is here as long as you live Uncle John I never meant to
part with you when I thought you poor and Ill not desert you now
that I know youre rich

Well said Patsy cried the Major

And Uncle John smiled and kissed the girl and then lighted his pipe
again for it had gone out

Section   General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone  For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support

Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included  Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBooks
eBook number often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII
compressed zipped HTML and others

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number  The replaced older file is renamed
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility

httpwwwgutenbergnet

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenbergtm
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks

EBooks posted prior to November  with eBook numbers BELOW 
are filed in directories based on their release date  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year

httpwwwibiblioorggutenbergetext

    Or etext       
              or 

EBooks posted since November  with etext numbers OVER  are
filed in a different way  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path  The path is based on the etext number which is
identical to the filename  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename  For
example an eBook of filename  would be found at

httpwwwgutenbergnet

or filename  would be found at
httpwwwgutenbergnet
