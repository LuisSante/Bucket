                           BY E G VON WALD

               Hal was stranded in the wilderness with
               a beautiful girl and it was surprisingly
              enjoyablewhile his conditioning was off
             But after all how uncivilized can one get

Hal Webber leaned back in the soft Formair Executives seat Although
he twisted and shifted his position restlessly he received the same
sensation of perfect comfortable support no matter which way he
sat in it Which was only natural of course Formair was the best
suspendfield furniture manufactured

As he squirmed about he had a faint puzzled frown on his face and in
his stomach he felt a lurking sensation of unaccustomed tension Hal
simply could not understand it

There was a faint humming sound as the door panel slid back His
father entered the office

Well Hal the old man murmured softly with a placid smile of
satisfaction Weve done it

Done what Oh you mean the new coloration process

Yes It will quintuple the net value of the family fortune within a
year We may be the richest people in the world then

Thats nice Hal said mildly

His father flicked a finger across a sensitive spot on the front of the
desk and relaxed as a perfect Formair attendants chair sprang into
existence to fit his gross soft body

Yes indeed he said with a mild sigh Its been a long long time
that weve been working for that Worked mighty hard too

Thats right murmured Hal a little more forcefully than necessary
Splendid

His fathers eyebrows rose at the unusual emphasis but he was much
too cultured to question the point He continued along the lines of
the conversation already started Well have to do something for
Bruchner He has been of tremendous assistance on that project Did it
practically all by himself He is a very intelligent man even if he is
an Outlander

Bruchner said Hal with mild irritation All I hear around here
lately is Bruchner What is he anyway Nothing but a savage

Eh said his father softly raising his eyebrows again in polite
inquiry

If Bruchner is such a brilliant fellow why doesnt he take the
Treatment and become civilized I sometimes get a little tired of an
employee who tells me Im wrong all the time

But he is almost always right when he makes such statements Hal
Webber pointed out mildly For instance just the other day I asked
him about the color range to be used with the new process on the
Formair Skydome He stated flatly that blue was a normal color for sky
Just like that I was a little startled of course at his lack of
courtesy But after I thought it over a while blue did seem to be a
nice color for sky

Aaa blue Hal muttered Whats wrong with the green weve always
used in the past

Mr Webber sighed and squirmed a little to get the chair into a more
comfortable fit Attendants chairs were not quite as comfortable
as the Executive type even if they were Formair Then he cocked an
eyebrow and looked at his son with mild concern Hal my boy whats
the trouble Ive never seen you so completely upset in all my life

I feel funny murmured Hal As a matter of fact I feel awful Maybe
theres some connection

Ill the old man nodded agreeably Yes I thought you looked it when
I came in here Something in the set of your mouth Tight sort of

With an expression of mild surprise Hal reached up and tentatively
felt around his mouth with a cleanly manicured forefinger

Son Webber murmured how long has it been since you had your last
CC Treatment

Eight years Hal admitted Its a little overdue I suppose but
surely His voice trailed off softly as his mind seized upon the
possibility

Thats probably what it is Webber replied That was a pretty
definite statement for someone to make about anothers sensations but
anyone could see that the old man was concerned over his son Five
years is the standard period at your age Why havent you taken it

Well you know Hal whispered Its that new thing they have in it
now

Ah said his father with comprehension Thats right I forgot all
about that A change But you wont mind really you wont You just
think you will

Perhaps so Hal said and hastily changed the subject of conversation
to a less depressing topic The new coloration process is a real
success you say

Absolutely We can now provide flexible hue and chroma for the
complete Formair lineAirchair Aircab and Airdome Well be the only
one who has it and since every Proprietor on the planet will want
our new equipment as fast as we turn it out well put every other
firm completely out of the business Ive already worked out a method
so that we can convert to export goods too without waiting for the
economic balance to be readjusted Of course the colonies will have to
curtail a little but we dont have to concern ourselves with them

Yes agreed Hal

Bruchner has been very useful to us on it the old man repeated
again Well have to show him we appreciate it

Hals mouth tightened just perceptibly at the mention of the
redoubtable engineer but he said nothing His father continued in his
soft mild voice We must make him a present of something Should
it be money Cant give him property of course because he isnt a
citizen

I dont like the idea of giving an Outlander money They get their
allotments and thats enough wealth If you give them money they will
be able to buy more than their allotment and that could very easily
upset our own economic balance you know

Quite true Webber agreed Then he smiled with placid inspiration I
know Well give him fame Well name the process after him

Well Hal said doubtfully I guess that would do it

I think so Hes been a great help As a matter of fact though most
of the Outlanders are helpful A pity they wont take the Treatments
and become citizens It seems sort of sad the way their emotions cut
them up at times Like old Tanan last month Why up to then he was
almost like a civilized maneven without the treatments

I know Hal said tonelessly It was his son wasnt it

Yes Curious that the old man should be so concerned over that
little unpleasantness So his son did get a little excited and kill a
Proprietor and was executed himself No reason for his father to carry
on so about it is there I tried to get him to take the Treatment
then butwell after all you can hardly expect an uncivilized
Outlander to appreciate the advantages can you

No Hal did not refer to the fact that the new element recently put
into the standard CC Treatment was causing him to postpone taking it
himself but his father seemed to sense his thought

You wont mind it son Really you wont The Treatment will take care
of the whole thing Its perfectly obvious that you are suffering from
the effects of the delay right at this moment

Oh Chaos Hal swore softly Why did they have to go and put that
element in anyway

Now Hal you know better than that his father chided him gently It
was either include a marital inclination or else go in for a complete
program of artificial insemination The women have a vote too you
know and they wouldnt hear of it They dont object to carrying
a child for a few monthsthats always been in their conditioning
for some reason or another But they insisted that if they had to be
mothers the men would have to be fathers And they insisted on a
standard civilized marriage contract to cover the situation

I know I know Ive heard all the arguments Racial suicide and all
Nonsense We can always import Outlanders and force them to take the
Treatment Outlanders he pointed out with suitable mild cultured
disgust breed like animals

No son that wouldnt do the job We have to keep the blood line
Outlanders dont have it you know If they did they would have
permitted themselves to be civilized long ago

Hals fingers drummed nervously on the desk top and his father again
raised an eyebrow in mild concern He shook his head thoughtfully

Guiltily Hal stopped his fingers from their satisfying tattoo He
bunched them into a fist instead and then gazed at it with mild
unbelief

All right he finally whispered This is simply awful And it looks
as if in order to be cured Ill have to get me a wife along with it A
pity though Everything was perfectly mild without one

Youll be mild with a wife Hal his father assured him softly
You dont like the prospect now because it means change Change of
course is always unpleasant But the Treatment will take care of it
all right I know that I didnt expect things to work out so mildly
with a wife It was optional back in those days and if it hadnt
been for your mothers family money I never would have married
Particularly herwith her family history of fecundity As witnessed
by the children we producedyou and your sister But Formair needed
the money and I was the only available man in the Webber clan When
I agreed to make the sacrifice they made me president of the firm
because it isnt often that a man will do so much for his own family
Shows real character Its in the cultured family blood naturally

Hal had heard all this many many times before but he listened without
irritation Or at least with only the mild irritation that was the
result of his present unstable condition

Yes indeed his father went on in his mild comfortable voice
Hardly knew she was around the house though once the Treatment was
over with It was just as if she had been around all my life Marvelous
process

All right Hal murmured Ill take it

Be a good idea to pick out a wife first Sometimes there are a
few minor adjustments to make because of outstanding individual
characteristics You get an absolutely perfect fit that way you know
He stood up and walked toward the door the flabby muscles of his body
easily supporting the two pounds relative of his weight

The Ansermet family has a female available I believe he murmured
as he walked Excellent choice But you better have the probability
checked anyway

I know about her Hal replied thoughtfully But whats she like
Have you ever met her

His father smiled benignly back at him as he practically floated
through the doorway That doesnt matter a bit he said mildly It
doesnt make any difference at all what either of you are like The
Treatment will bring you both back to absolute statistical normal
and youll both be a perfect fit for each other Quite pleasantly
civilized

The door hummed shut behind him

Well Hal announced aloud to himself guess thats it

He ordered the automatic secretary to make all suitable arrangements
and then stood up He walked to the elevator where a soft hissing
breeze conveyed his temporary onetenth pound relative gently up the
tube to the roof There his weight returned to its normal two pounds
relative and he spoke to the robot attendant My cab His Formair
Aircab was promptly and quietly delivered and Hal stepped inside

Destination a voice inquired softly from the control bank

Take me to the nearest available Civilization Conditioning Treatment
Center

At once the cab took off It was a silent and comfortable motion Hal
had always liked flying

The automatic pilot was speaking to him gently Central Authority
advises that the nearest available CCT Center at this time is in
the metropolis of Knoxville This requires traversing interurban
wilderness

Hal frowned just slightly He had never seen the interurban wilderness
of course and had not the slightest desire to do so That was chaos
He inquired How soon can the local Center take me

Three days seven hours twenty minutes from reference time Mark
time  mark the robot announced the temporal point of reference

Too long Hal replied wearily Lets go to Knoxville And shut off
all outside views I do not wish to see the chaos

The Aircab obediently turned and transposed through the suspendfield
of the York metropolis Airdome It was an effortless passing since the
field that constituted the wall structure of the Aircab was exactly in
phase with that of the Airdome field Both were Formair manufacture of
course

The pleasant silent effortless motion of the Aircab soon produced its
usual somnolent effect on him and he dozed comfortably off He slept
the entire trip

At Knoxville he spoke to the Center Technician briefly advising the
master robot of the possibility of his altered economic status and the
matter was thoroughly checked by the computer at Central Authority
Every conceivable source of psychosomatic tension and internal conflict
was studied and suitable alterations on Hals master curve plotted
The process took ten minutes while Hal dozed under the soothing warmth
of the examination cap There was a crackling buzz and it was over

He awoke immediately and felt wonderful No tension No irritation
Not the slightest bit of his recent restlessness Hal was delighted
On the way out of the cubicle he encountered another Proprietor and
smiled at him with perfect civilized mildness

York he ordered his Aircab Once again the sleek buttonshaped
vehicle soared up through the Airdome and out over the interurban
wilderness Hal contentedly went to sleep right in the middle of the
pilots automatic rundown of flight data

                                   

He was jolted awake by a raucous rattle from the control bank Blinking
his eyes sleepily he said Please stop all that noise What is the
trouble

A very unpleasant and notably ungentle voice replied Apologies sir
We are out of control Aircrash has occurred

Aircrash An almost unheardof thing that sometimes happened to people
who used inferior equipment like that produced by firms other than
Formair People were even known to be killed by it

Report he said quietly then flinched a little at the raucous
scratching of the speech mechanism

Reference point  mark Altitude eleven thousand three hundred
seventy one feet Velocity reduced to two hundred nine point nine
miles per hour Locus seven hundred point eight miles from nearest
civilized metropolis which is York The voice continued but became
unintelligible as the mangled circuits faltered

Seven hundred miles from civilization Wilderness Chaos that settled
it of course Hal smiled gently as he realized that he was about to
die A civilized man obviously could not be expected to survive in
chaos He observed that he was breathing more strenuously and realized
that it was the result of the rapid failure of the antigravity field
Never in his life had Hal been under the full force of the earths mass
field but he knew the symptoms Once he had been exposed to a onehalf
gee for a few hours Very unpleasant he recalled

The automatic pilots unintelligible speech suddenly stopped
altogether There was a heavy awkward lurch that threw Hal forward
against the front panel But before he struck it the field generator
failed completely the panel ceased to exist and Hal was flying
through the air He shut his eyes and placidly waited for death

A moment later he hit the ground sharply rolled over and over and
lay still

He sighed heavily Death He had always fancied that death would be a
complete absence of sensation and no consciousness of effort whatever
Instead his breath was coming in deep heavy sighs his head hurt his
arm was aching and something was tickling his nose

Come on wake up a voice said briskly

Hal opened his eyes and looked up at a goldenframed face It was the
face that had been speaking and the pleasingly shaped lips now moved
again You arent hurt you know Just a little shaken up

Hal continued to stare at the woman for a moment then muttered
Umph and struggled to a sitting posture It was a great effort in
the unaccustomed full earth gravitational field The woman was an
Outlander no doubt about it That was evident from her highly spirited
tone of voice But as Hal looked around at the strange picture of
undisturbed interurban wilderness he found that most astonishingly
he did not mind it As a matter of fact he rather liked her tone of
voice It was all very puzzling

What happened he muttered heavily his eyes moving back to the
landscape and the small metal boxes which housed the now defunct
suspendfield generators

There must have been something wrong with your Aircab she replied
You crashed The same way I did a couple days ago The woman walked
over to the generator boxes picked them up and brought them back to
where he was still sitting on the grass Well need these she
explained There are emergency supplies inside them

Hal didnt move She waited a moment then said lightly tossing her
golden hair Come along now Were way out in the wilderness you
know and there arent any robots to bring us our dinner

Wilderness Hal murmured Thats right Well I guess well die
here

Oh nonsense She stamped her foot with impatience This would have
to happen to me Of all people to be stranded with in the wilderness I
have to get one of you insipid gutless Proprietors

Oh yes Hal said with unconscious anger lurching to his feet Whos
insipid and gutless Im considerably more civilized than you are
Quick surprise crossed her face as she listened Hal continued his
angry speech Why is it that all you savages always think you know how
to live better than your superiors If you are so clever why arent
you civilized

Well listen to him You sound almost human

She was laughing at him

Damn savage he growled He turned and strode purposefully away from
her across the soft matting of grass

Where do you think you are going she called

Away from here he replied But the rapid pace in the unaccustomed
gravity was very quickly taking his energy His breath came in deep
labored gasps already and he could scarcely move his feet

He stopped abruptly and looked at the distant horizon There was
nothing in sight that indicated civilization These regions had
not been inhabited for two hundred and fifty yearsever since
the severance of the planetary colonies from political control by
the motherland and the settling of the Proprietors into their
wellseparated civilized cities The land was all owned by the
Proprietors but was unnecessary and hence not used

He felt a light touch on his arm

Im sorry she apologized softly I can understand you a little but
youre so completely under the influence of your horrible personality
conditioning methods that you cant possibly understand me

Whos under what influence Hal said in a valiant attempt to express
his irritation but his voice held the obvious weakness of fatigue

You poor boy she sympathized You dont sound very much influenced
by it right now

At her words Hal suddenly became aware of the unaccustomed vigor
of his own emotions and he was puzzled by it But it seemed oddly
unimportant for some reason How come you can handle this awful weight
so easily he asked her

Her laughter was light and delightful We spend most of our lives
under natural conditions not under an antigravity machine Ive only
been on Earth for a few months visiting my father But a lot of that
time was spent out here in this beautiful wilderness

Horrible chaos he muttered He glanced up and observed a mild blue
cloudstudded sky Why it is blue after all Isnt it

Whats blue

The skydome

She glanced up thoughtfully Of course its blue And this is not one
of your artificial skys This is the real thing Theres no artificial
weather control out here you know You get natural sunlight natural
winds storms rainoh lots of things

Gahh said Hal

What makes you surprised at finding that the sky is blue

Probably because I never saw it before The only time I ever heard
of its being anything other than green was when an engineer we have
working for us at the factory said it was blue

Well never mind the sky Lets find some place where we can get a
little shelter for the night She began to lead him slowly along an
animal trail to a cluster of trees on a nearby stream She walked with
the obviously delayed pace one takes with invalids but Hal had a
difficult time keeping up

Finally she said Heres a pretty good place Sit down next to that
tree You must be worn out

Oooo he groaned reclining back against a broad rough oak trunk
then stiffening painfully away from it again It doesnt fit he
mourned plaintively

Now youre sounding silly again she scolded Go on lean back
There arent any suspendfield lounges out here for you so you take
what you get

Obediently he relaxed against the rough twisting bark He was very
very tired On second thought even this rugged seat was comfortable
He sighed heavily and then looked pensively around again Oh well
what does it matter Well be dead soon

Dont talk like that she snapped with annoyance

Why he inquired listlessly Everybody knows a civilized human being
cant possibly survive in the wilderness Thats why no one ever comes
here And Id just as soon die right now if you have anything suitable
for killing

The woman stared at him with a tight frown between her eyebrows Then
she shook her head with wonder How you people can call yourselves
civilized is beyond me You yourself dont seem so bad except that you
dont have any guts Theyve trained it all out by now

Please begged Hal You sound like that uncouth engineer that works
for us Impertinent

That what engineer she demanded spiritedly Who are you anyway

Im Webber Hal Webber The engineer is a savageoh sorry He smiled
weakly Youre a savage too Guess you Outlanders dont regard
yourselves as such

No we dont she snapped And if it werent for us you silly fools
here on Earth would have died out long ago

Outlanders are noted for their misplaced pride of course Hal
commented with a mildness that was impelled by fatigue rather than
civilized conditioning

Oh are we now she said angrily standing up and bending over him
And who do you think you are Lord Proprietor Some humble god
perhaps Let me tell you something Hal Webber Ive heard about you
You know who I am My name is Lois Bruchner That uncouth engineer you
just referred to happens to be my father

Hal was puzzled What on earth is the matter he asked Why are you
so excited

You called my father uncouth

Why get excited about that After all Hal gestured weakly trying
to reason with her its only your father I didnt say you were
uncouth Funny thing isI like you

Suppose I called your father names she demanded her lower lip
protruding belligerently

You can call him anything you like as far as I am concerned

Lois Bruchner stood there a moment her mouth open in astonishment
Then she sat down beside him again quietly

Thats right she murmured they even educate love out of you

Hal sighed heavily and slid away from the tree onto the rough rocky
ground It was painful but he was so tired His breath came in
regular deep sighs as he went to sleep

                                   

By the time he woke Lois had constructed a kind of primitive leanto
shelter over him Hal was amazed The sheltering purpose of the
structure was evident to him and he was startled that she should have
been able to design such a thing on the spur of the moment

She heard him stir and looked up from the fire she had built in front
of the leanto Hungry she asked

He was ravenous but his muscles ached in every fibre His wonder at
her cleverness disappeared abruptly when he tried to move He rolled
over groaning and helpless

Immediately she was at his side pushing him back onto the bed of dry
fragrant grass she had put him on Now dont try to move around she
admonished Just a few days and youll be all right

Oooo Hal groaned This is awful

There there she murmured solicitously Ive made you some soup
Youll like it

Soup he groaned I want food Good solid synthomeat Dont you have
any food

Solid food in your stomach so soon in this heavy gravity would kill
you

She went away and returned quickly with a little cup and spoon and
proceeded to empty the container into his lax mouth a few drops at a
time After a while he ceased his protesting It was less painful
to swallow the slop than to fight it Very soon afterward he lost
consciousness

                                   

Later he was again aware of his surroundings He felt tremendously
better and observed with a peculiar satisfaction that it was morning
Funny sounds were in the air which he eventually recognized as the
cries of wild birds and insects Insects He blinked his eyes and
struggled to a sitting position and looked worriedly around Insects
can carry disease he remembered And wild animals were reported to be
carnivorous

His clumsy motions awakened Lois who had been sleeping beside him Hal
looked down at her with a vague wonder Such a nice looking savage
he thought as she popped open her eyes She smiled a pleased morning
smile at him and lazily stretched

Hi she said How do you feel

Quite mild Hal admitted with wonder Odd too That junk you fed me
last night must have some very efficient drug in it

Junk I fed you last night Lois echoed sitting up Then she laughed
her amusement Oh you mean that soup That wasnt last night Hal
Webber That was last week

ButI just woke up he protested

Yes She smiled at him reaching up and patting his cheek
affectionately Youve been a little delirious Gravity trauma very
common You get used to it fast but thats one thing they didnt
condition you to I guess and your conscious promptly rejected the
possibility

Sudden remembrance came to Hal of the agony it had been to move
the last time he remembered trying it Cautiously he lifted an arm
and flexed it He glanced back at Lois who was watching him with
amusement It feels all right now Heavy and clumsy but no pain

Good She stood up and brushed her unruly hair away from her
forehead Ill fix your breakfast just as soon as I take my bath all
right she said Hal nodded absently The stream was twenty yards
away and Lois walked quickly over to it There she pulled her jumper
over her head and dove into the crystal water Eeii its cold she
shrieked Her vigorous splashing threw sharp brilliance in the early
morning sunlight After a few minutes she came out letting the water
dry on her soft golden skin

Hal was watching her in openmouthed admiration It was a most
remarkable sensation this pleasure at seeing her move in that lithe
supple way He had never before experienced such a thing

As she came up on the grassy bank she noticed his rapt gaze and
quickly snatched up her single garment and held it in front of her
All right she told him briskly You too Youre much too big for me
to handle effectively so you havent had a decent bath since we got
here And it gets pretty hot during the day

Obediently as if in a vicspell Hal stood up and walked to the
waters edge keeping his eyes on her

Look where youre going she said sharply and he shook his head
dazedly He slowly removed his clothing dropped it on the ground and
jumped into the water

That was the end of the spell The water was like ice he howled like
a wounded animal and tried to jump out again But the gravity made him
clumsy and he fell back with a great splash He rose again gasping and
sputtering making wild awkward movementsin a frenzy to get out of
the excruciating coldness Finally he was lying on the grass panting
and exhausted

Lois was standing over him her pale blue eyes dancing with delight
What a spectacle she bubbled merrily You should have seen
yourself I sure wish I had a vicograph with me Such performances
should be preserved

Unaccountably Hal found himself gurgling like a delighted baby and
then laughing with her in loud uncivilized guffaws

After a few minutes they were both worn out with hilarity Lois
sighed She gave him a brimming smile and went on back to the leanto
Get your clothes on she said Ill have some breakfast for you in a
few minutes

                                   

It was food Hal agreed but it was not very good It had come out of
the standard emergency ration from the Aircab master units and no
power on earth could have made it very palatable And the supply was
nearly gone

I dont know how we can get back she said thoughtfully as she
chewed on a wafer Plenty of Aircabs go byIve seen a dozen or
so during the past week But nobody ever looks out of them except
Outlanders and there arent many of us around So there isnt any
point in building a signal fire

Hal did not reply He lay back on the grass his belly full with
unaccustomed satisfaction staring at the blue sky He decided that he
still preferred green Its sort of a washedout color he murmured

What

The sky Its sort of pallid and weaklooking

Thats haze But spoken like a big strong man she said lightly And
then wistfully added A pity they always take it out of you

Hal frowned and looked down from the sky to the windblown dampness of
her golden hair What do you mean by that he inquired

Nothing Her gaze returned modestly to her wafer and she continued
the former subject We were talking about getting back to what you
call civilization remember Or do you prefer we become the new Adam
and Eve lost in the wilderness she asked her eyes dancing We could
start a new primitive dynasty of plains savages

Oh Hals mind came back to the immediate problem Oh yes thats
right We have to get back He frowned a moment Well now lets see
Therere a number of emergency stations spotted around the interurban
wilderness Cant just remember where I learned about themmust have
been Treatment information He thoughtfully picked up a stick and
began drawing diagrams of maps in the loose soil There He pointed
with the stick One of them should be about two hundred miles north
of where we are now provided the automatic pilot of my Aircab was
accurate in its final position fix

Lois was looking at the crude map when he glanced back up at her There
seemed to be a sadness in her expression She nodded her head at the
map From that it looks like those emasculating treatments do some
good after all

Dont talk like that he reproved her The Civilization Conditioning
Treatment is the basis of our culture

She started to speak hesitated and then blurted out What
precisely does it do for you

Dont you know Hal asked astonished and then answered his own
question Oh of course Outlanders would hardly know much about
civilized history Well before interplanetary exploration was started
there werent any areas at all like this wilderness The planet was
much too crowded The people lived in huge contiguous cities and were
incessantly battling with each other for economic survival social
survival and animal survival The vast majority of the population
couldnt stand it They developed all kinds of psychogenic illnesses
The impact of the uncontrolled inclinations of individuals meeting the
absolute selfcontrol required by civilization was killing them

Then gradually the Civilization Conditioning process was developed
What happened then was just what you would expectthe people who
took the Treatments were so much better adapted to civilized living
conditions that the others simply didnt have a chance Just as soon
as planetary colonies were opened up the savages were all shipped
off There were a lot of riots and smallscale wars for a while but
eventually the superior conditioning of the civilized people won out

After things had stabilized again anyone who wanted to was permitted
to become an Earth citizen but he had to take the Treatment and keep
it up But by that time most savages had a lot of peculiar prejudices
against it so the population of Earth has remained very small The
robotic defenses of the Proprietors protected the planet from further
invasion and now the robotic police maintain order everywhere in the
system

Of course the planets are extremely poor in natural resources so
we supply the basic material even though we relinquished political
control long ago The colonies pay us by sending unusually gifted
technicians like your father to work for us Naturally Outlanders
have no rights whatsoever here Not even the right to life or
freedom or payment of the material allotment But unless they commit
a crime or otherwise interfere with the Proprietors there is not the
slightest danger of being molested by any citizen because citizens are
civilized

Hal stopped his history lecture and looked back up at her The
Treatment is responsible for the entire rational order of our culture
as you probably know

But look how insipid it makes you all she burst out Youre so weak
and wishywashy There isnt a noble or even a strong sentiment in your
entire society

That is how the process works It is nothing but a series of checks
and balances artificially installed in the subconscious which make
strong sentiments unnecessary and which prevent unstable activity
The result is a perfectly smooth existence with no ups or downs and a
perfect cooperation between civilized people

Lois thought this over for a moment Then she asked curiously How
do you account for the fact that youafter all the Treatments you
have takenare so different from other Proprietors You well
she stumbled blushing a littleyou seem perfectly normal in your
reactions

Hal shook his head I dont know Maybe my last Treatment had an error
in it But he shook his head again at that idea because the computer
at Central Authority never made mistakes It is strange

I think its wonderful She smiled at him with quick radiance

Hal grinned happily back at her feeling an alien surge of joy as he
looked at the smile and at her Well whatever it is for the next few
months or so it looks like well be savages in fact

                                   

They were And they took a long time walking north to their
destination It was a remarkably satisfying experience for Hal And it
was for Lois too as she pointed out to him the night after they found
the emergency station There was a small Formair shelter at the place
and a simple automatic distress transmitter which was set in operation
by one push of a button Symbols marked on the case of the transmitter
assured them that assistance would be forthcoming within twelve hours

It was their first night in a civilized shelter and their last night
together in the wilderness Early the next morning an Authority Aircab
came humming swiftly down to the meadow where they were waiting

Once inside the Aircab Hal became taciturn and thoughtful but Lois
was not disturbed She talked enough for both of them Hal luxuriated
in the pleasant reawakened rapport with the things of civilization

Back at the city they went to Bruchners residence and Lois father
rushed outside to greet them Lois ran happily to him embracing
him and volubly explaining how wonderful Hal was how he had saved
her from being gobbled up by a lot of wild animals and how strong
he was and sundry other affectionately innocuous exaggerations Hal
looked curiously on for a few minutes in idle wonder at the strange
attachments of Outlanders Then Lois proudly pulled him over next to
her

Isnt he wonderful And were in loveoh so much in love

Lois Bruchner mumbled unhappily There are some things you have to
be told I should have told you before

You dont have to tell me anything she bubbled happily You can
say all you want to about the Proprietors but this one is different
Heshes real

Hal laughed diffidently and moved a little further away from her He
gazed around at the city recognizing it with thirsty familiarity
happily part of it again The experience of the past three months
already seemed far away

Hal Lois murmured suddenly aware of his rapidly growing coolness
Hal darling whats wrong

Why nothing at all uh Lois He looked at her uncomfortably for a
moment and backed a step further Its justwell you know

Oh no you dont she cried rushing up to him and grabbing his arm
Where are you goingDad

Please Miss Bruchner Hal murmured mildly disengaging his arm from
her He gazed hungrily around him again the moment she let go and
looked back at her only when he was startled by a sudden choking sob
Lois was staring at him her fist to her mouth the pale blue eyes
brimming

Oh no she cried tremulously

Lois Bruchner said his voice sounding harsh with repressed
emotions come in here Youve got to know what the situation is He
put his arm around her trembling shoulders and led her off glaring at
Hal in helpless fury

The moment they were out of sight Hal turned and stepped back into
the Aircab He ordered it to take him home His parents were there
watching a vicentertainment which Hal promptly turned off

Who did that his father mumbled coming immediately out of the
trance Hal That wasnt a very nice thing to do son

Why Hal his mother sighed mildly Youre not dead after all
How nice Dont pay any attention to your fatherit wasnt a very
interesting vic anyway

Shouldnt turn it off like that though

Um sorry Hal apologized gently He relaxed into the comfortable
perfect fit of a Formair lounge Just thought Id let you know Im
still alive

Well were glad his mother murmured absently Must have been
pretty awful

Thats the funny thing about it thoughI didnt mind it a bit at
the time Very curious I had an Outlander woman with meBruchners
daughter as a matter of fact

Oh dear Mrs Webber sighed Poor Hal

Well like I say it wasnt exactly mild but it was quite tolerable
somehow He frowned just slightly and shook his head at the
puzzling incongruity He recalled his three months of association
with the uncivilized woman somewhat wistfully contemplating strong
overpowering sentiments in a chaotic wilderness Anyway he said at
last Im home again and its all over I wont have to have anything
to do with her now

Yes Mrs Webber murmured Odd that you should have survived though
isnt it I thought a civilized man in the wilderness would die almost
at once

Webber gave the cultured equivalent of a mild snort Of course he
could survive Oh and he laughed softly in apology thats right
I forgot to tell you about that

The eyes of his wife politely turned to him and he explained A couple
of weeks after our son here apparently had been killed I happened
to run into an Authority physician I mentioned it to him just in
passing He told me that there was a factor in the CC Treatment that
provided for such things

It seems that the Civilization Conditioning they give you is only
designed to enable a man to survive in a city In order for the
conditioning to function you have to have that civilized urban
environment Once the environment is removed the conditioned complex
has nothing to react against and the man immediately becomes
almostbut not quiteas savage as a typical Outlander

That way a civilized man can always manage to live in the wilderness
given half a chance Once he gets back into a city again the proper
civilized environment is returned the conditioning starts functioning
immediately and prestothe man is civilized again

Well now thats nice Mrs Webber said placidly Wouldnt like to
see my boy dead

Yes her husband mused The physician told me that right after we
decided Hal was dead I was going to mention it to you but it slipped
my mind somehow

Well youre just a tiny bit forgetful at times dear Mrs Webber
sighed softly and turned to her son Hal dear its awfully nice to
see you back again Would you be kind enough to switch the vic back
on

                                   

Contentedly Hal complied and was himself immediately carried away by
the vicarious entertainment pleased to put the disturbing dream of the
past three months comfortably behind him
