CHAPTER VI

WELL pretty soon the old man was up and around again and then he went
for Judge Thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money and he
went for me too for not stopping school  He catched me a couple of
times and thrashed me but I went to school just the same and dodged him
or outrun him most of the time  I didnt want to go to school much
before but I reckoned Id go now to spite pap  That law trial was a
slow businessappeared like they warnt ever going to get started on
it so every now and then Id borrow two or three dollars off of the
judge for him to keep from getting a cowhiding  Every time he got money
he got drunk and every time he got drunk he raised Cain around town and
every time he raised Cain he got jailed  He was just suitedthis kind
of thing was right in his line

He got to hanging around the widows too much and so she told him at last
that if he didnt quit using around there she would make trouble for him
Well WASNT he mad  He said he would show who was Huck Finns boss  So
he watched out for me one day in the spring and catched me and took me
up the river about three mile in a skiff and crossed over to the
Illinois shore where it was woody and there warnt no houses but an old
log hut in a place where the timber was so thick you couldnt find it if
you didnt know where it was

He kept me with him all the time and I never got a chance to run off
We lived in that old cabin and he always locked the door and put the key
under his head nights  He had a gun which he had stole I reckon and we
fished and hunted and that was what we lived on  Every little while he
locked me in and went down to the store three miles to the ferry and
traded fish and game for whisky and fetched it home and got drunk and
had a good time and licked me  The widow she found out where I was by
and by and she sent a man over to try to get hold of me but pap drove
him off with the gun and it warnt long after that till I was used to
being where I was and liked itall but the cowhide part

It was kind of lazy and jolly laying off comfortable all day smoking
and fishing and no books nor study  Two months or more run along and
my clothes got to be all rags and dirt and I didnt see how Id ever got
to like it so well at the widows where you had to wash and eat on a
plate and comb up and go to bed and get up regular and be forever
bothering over a book and have old Miss Watson pecking at you all the
time  I didnt want to go back no more  I had stopped cussing because
the widow didnt like it but now I took to it again because pap hadnt
no objections  It was pretty good times up in the woods there take it
all around

But by and by pap got too handy with his hickry and I couldnt stand
it I was all over welts  He got to going away so much too and locking
me in  Once he locked me in and was gone three days  It was dreadful
lonesome  I judged he had got drowned and I wasnt ever going to get
out any more  I was scared  I made up my mind I would fix up some way
to leave there  I had tried to get out of that cabin many a time but I
couldnt find no way  There warnt a window to it big enough for a dog
to get through  I couldnt get up the chimbly it was too narrow  The
door was thick solid oak slabs  Pap was pretty careful not to leave a
knife or anything in the cabin when he was away I reckon I had hunted
the place over as much as a hundred times well I was most all the time
at it because it was about the only way to put in the time  But this
time I found something at last I found an old rusty woodsaw without any
handle it was laid in between a rafter and the clapboards of the roof
I greased it up and went to work  There was an old horseblanket nailed
against the logs at the far end of the cabin behind the table to keep
the wind from blowing through the chinks and putting the candle out  I
got under the table and raised the blanket and went to work to saw a
section of the big bottom log outbig enough to let me through  Well
it was a good long job but I was getting towards the end of it when I
heard paps gun in the woods  I got rid of the signs of my work and
dropped the blanket and hid my saw and pretty soon pap come in

Pap warnt in a good humorso he was his natural self  He said he was
down town and everything was going wrong  His lawyer said he reckoned
he would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got started on
the trial but then there was ways to put it off a long time and Judge
Thatcher knowed how to do it  And he said people allowed thered be
another trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my
guardian and they guessed it would win this time  This shook me up
considerable because I didnt want to go back to the widows any more
and be so cramped up and sivilized as they called it  Then the old man
got to cussing and cussed everything and everybody he could think of
and then cussed them all over again to make sure he hadnt skipped any
and after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round
including a considerable parcel of people which he didnt know the names
of and so called them whatshisname when he got to them and went
right along with his cussing

He said he would like to see the widow get me  He said he would watch
out and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a place
six or seven mile off to stow me in where they might hunt till they
dropped and they couldnt find me  That made me pretty uneasy again but
only for a minute I reckoned I wouldnt stay on hand till he got that
chance

The old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had got
There was a fiftypound sack of corn meal and a side of bacon
ammunition and a fourgallon jug of whisky and an old book and two
newspapers for wadding besides some tow  I toted up a load and went
back and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest  I thought it all
over and I reckoned I would walk off with the gun and some lines and
take to the woods when I run away  I guessed I wouldnt stay in one
place but just tramp right across the country mostly night times and
hunt and fish to keep alive and so get so far away that the old man nor
the widow couldnt ever find me any more  I judged I would saw out and
leave that night if pap got drunk enough and I reckoned he would  I got
so full of it I didnt notice how long I was staying till the old man
hollered and asked me whether I was asleep or drownded

I got the things all up to the cabin and then it was about dark  While
I was cooking supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort of
warmed up and went to ripping again  He had been drunk over in town
and laid in the gutter all night and he was a sight to look at  A body
would a thought he was Adamhe was just all mud  Whenever his liquor
begun to work he most always went for the govment this time he says

Call this a govment why just look at it and see what its like
Heres the law astanding ready to take a mans son away from hima
mans own son which he has had all the trouble and all the anxiety and
all the expense of raising  Yes just as that man has got that son
raised at last and ready to go to work and begin to do suthin for HIM
and give him a rest the law up and goes for him  And they call THAT
govment  That aint all nuther  The law backs that old Judge Thatcher
up and helps him to keep me out o my property  Heres what the law
does  The law takes a man worth six thousand dollars and upards and
jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this and lets him go round in
clothes that aint fitten for a hog They call that govment  A man cant
get his rights in a govment like this Sometimes Ive a mighty notion to
just leave the country for good and all Yes and I TOLD em so I told
old Thatcher so to his face  Lots of em heard me and can tell what I
said  Says I for two cents Id leave the blamed country and never come
anear it agin  Thems the very words  I says look at my hatif you
call it a hatbut the lid raises up and the rest of it goes down till
its below my chin and then it aint rightly a hat at all but more like
my head was shoved up through a jint o stovepipe  Look at it says I
such a hat for me to wearone of the wealthiest men in this town if I
could git my rights

Oh yes this is a wonderful govment wonderful  Why looky here
There was a free nigger there from Ohioa mulatter most as white as a
white man  He had the whitest shirt on you ever see too and the
shiniest hat and there aint a man in that town thats got as fine
clothes as what he had and he had a gold watch and chain and a
silverheaded canethe awfulest old grayheaded nabob in the State  And
what do you think  They said he was a pfessor in a college and could
talk all kinds of languages and knowed everything  And that aint the
wust They said he could VOTE when he was at home  Well that let me
out Thinks I what is the country acoming to  It was lection day and
I was just about to go and vote myself if I warnt too drunk to get
there but when they told me there was a State in this country where
theyd let that nigger vote I drawed out  I says Ill never vote agin
Thems the very words I said they all heard me and the country may rot
for all me Ill never vote agin as long as I live  And to see the cool
way of that niggerwhy he wouldnt a give me the road if I hadnt
shoved him out o the way  I says to the people why aint this nigger
put up at auction and soldthats what I want to know  And what do you
reckon they said Why they said he couldnt be sold till hed been in
the State six months and he hadnt been there that long yet  There
nowthats a specimen  They call that a govment that cant sell a free
nigger till hes been in the State six months  Heres a govment that
calls itself a govment and lets on to be a govment and thinks it is a
govment and yets got to set stockstill for six whole months before it
can take a hold of a prowling thieving infernal whiteshirted free
nigger and

Pap was agoing on so he never noticed where his old limber legs was
taking him to so he went head over heels over the tub of salt pork and
barked both shins and the rest of his speech was all the hottest kind of
languagemostly hove at the nigger and the govment though he give the
tub some too all along here and there  He hopped around the cabin
considerable first on one leg and then on the other holding first one
shin and then the other one and at last he let out with his left foot
all of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick  But it warnt good
judgment because that was the boot that had a couple of his toes leaking
out of the front end of it so now he raised a howl that fairly made a
bodys hair raise and down he went in the dirt and rolled there and
held his toes and the cussing he done then laid over anything he had
ever done previous  He said so his own self afterwards  He had heard
old Sowberry Hagan in his best days and he said it laid over him too
but I reckon that was sort of piling it on maybe

After supper pap took the jug and said he had enough whisky there for
two drunks and one delirium tremens  That was always his word  I judged
he would be blind drunk in about an hour and then I would steal the key
or saw myself out one or tother  He drank and drank and tumbled down
on his blankets by and by but luck didnt run my way  He didnt go
sound asleep but was uneasy  He groaned and moaned and thrashed around
this way and that for a long time  At last I got so sleepy I couldnt
keep my eyes open all I could do and so before I knowed what I was about
I was sound asleep and the candle burning

I dont know how long I was asleep but all of a sudden there was an
awful scream and I was up  There was pap looking wild and skipping
around every which way and yelling about snakes  He said they was
crawling up his legs and then he would give a jump and scream and say
one had bit him on the cheekbut I couldnt see no snakes  He started
and run round and round the cabin hollering Take him off take him off
hes biting me on the neck  I never see a man look so wild in the eyes
Pretty soon he was all fagged out and fell down panting then he rolled
over and over wonderful fast kicking things every which way and
striking and grabbing at the air with his hands and screaming and saying
there was devils ahold of him  He wore out by and by and laid still a
while moaning  Then he laid stiller and didnt make a sound  I could
hear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods and it seemed
terrible still  He was laying over by the corner By and by he raised up
part way and listened with his head to one side  He says very low

Tramptramptramp thats the dead tramptramptramp theyre
coming after me but I wont go  Oh theyre here dont touch me
dont hands offtheyre cold let go  Oh let a poor devil alone

Then he went down on all fours and crawled off begging them to let him
alone and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under the
old pine table still abegging and then he went to crying  I could
hear him through the blanket

By and by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild and he
see me and went for me  He chased me round and round the place with a
claspknife calling me the Angel of Death and saying he would kill me
and then I couldnt come for him no more  I begged and told him I was
only Huck but he laughed SUCH a screechy laugh and roared and cussed
and kept on chasing me up  Once when I turned short and dodged under his
arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my shoulders and I
thought I was gone but I slid out of the jacket quick as lightning and
saved myself Pretty soon he was all tired out and dropped down with his
back against the door and said he would rest a minute and then kill me
He put his knife under him and said he would sleep and get strong and
then he would see who was who

So he dozed off pretty soon  By and by I got the old splitbottom chair
and clumb up as easy as I could not to make any noise and got down the
gun  I slipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded then I
laid it across the turnip barrel pointing towards pap and set down
behind it to wait for him to stir  And how slow and still the time did
drag along




CHAPTER VII

GIT up  What you bout

I opened my eyes and looked around trying to make out where I was  It
was after sunup and I had been sound asleep  Pap was standing over me
looking sour and sick too  He says

What you doin with this gun

I judged he didnt know nothing about what he had been doing so I says

Somebody tried to get in so I was laying for him

Why didnt you roust me out

Well I tried to but I couldnt I couldnt budge you

Well all right  Dont stand there palavering all day but out with you
and see if theres a fish on the lines for breakfast  Ill be along in a
minute

He unlocked the door and I cleared out up the riverbank  I noticed
some pieces of limbs and such things floating down and a sprinkling of
bark so I knowed the river had begun to rise  I reckoned I would have
great times now if I was over at the town  The June rise used to be
always luck for me because as soon as that rise begins here comes
cordwood floating down and pieces of log raftssometimes a dozen logs
together so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to the
woodyards and the sawmill

I went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and tother one out for
what the rise might fetch along  Well all at once here comes a canoe
just a beauty too about thirteen or fourteen foot long riding high
like a duck  I shot headfirst off of the bank like a frog clothes and
all on and struck out for the canoe  I just expected thered be
somebody laying down in it because people often done that to fool folks
and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it theyd raise up and
laugh at him  But it warnt so this time  It was a driftcanoe sure
enough and I clumb in and paddled her ashore  Thinks I the old man
will be glad when he sees thisshes worth ten dollars  But when I
got to shore pap wasnt in sight yet and as I was running her into a
little creek like a gully all hung over with vines and willows I struck
another idea  I judged Id hide her good and then stead of taking to
the woods when I run off Id go down the river about fifty mile and camp
in one place for good and not have such a rough time tramping on foot

It was pretty close to the shanty and I thought I heard the old man
coming all the time but I got her hid and then I out and looked around
a bunch of willows and there was the old man down the path a piece just
drawing a bead on a bird with his gun  So he hadnt seen anything

When he got along I was hard at it taking up a trot line  He abused me
a little for being so slow but I told him I fell in the river and that
was what made me so long  I knowed he would see I was wet and then he
would be asking questions  We got five catfish off the lines and went
home

While we laid off after breakfast to sleep up both of us being about
wore out I got to thinking that if I could fix up some way to keep pap
and the widow from trying to follow me it would be a certainer thing
than trusting to luck to get far enough off before they missed me you
see all kinds of things might happen  Well I didnt see no way for a
while but by and by pap raised up a minute to drink another barrel of
water and he says

Another time a man comes aprowling round here you roust me out you
hear That man warnt here for no good  Id a shot him  Next time you
roust me out you hear

Then he dropped down and went to sleep again but what he had been saying
give me the very idea I wanted  I says to myself I can fix it now so
nobody wont think of following me

About twelve oclock we turned out and went along up the bank  The river
was coming up pretty fast and lots of driftwood going by on the rise
By and by along comes part of a log raftnine logs fast together  We
went out with the skiff and towed it ashore  Then we had dinner
Anybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through so as to catch
more stuff but that warnt paps style  Nine logs was enough for one
time he must shove right over to town and sell  So he locked me in and
took the skiff and started off towing the raft about halfpast three  I
judged he wouldnt come back that night  I waited till I reckoned he had
got a good start then I out with my saw and went to work on that log
again  Before he was tother side of the river I was out of the hole
him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder

I took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid and
shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in then I done the same
with the side of bacon then the whiskyjug  I took all the coffee and
sugar there was and all the ammunition I took the wadding I took the
bucket and gourd I took a dipper and a tin cup and my old saw and two
blankets and the skillet and the coffeepot  I took fishlines and
matches and other thingseverything that was worth a cent  I cleaned
out the place  I wanted an axe but there wasnt any only the one out
at the woodpile and I knowed why I was going to leave that  I fetched
out the gun and now I was done

I had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging
out so many things  So I fixed that as good as I could from the outside
by scattering dust on the place which covered up the smoothness and the
sawdust  Then I fixed the piece of log back into its place and put two
rocks under it and one against it to hold it there for it was bent up at
that place and didnt quite touch ground  If you stood four or five foot
away and didnt know it was sawed you wouldnt never notice it and
besides this was the back of the cabin and it warnt likely anybody
would go fooling around there

It was all grass clear to the canoe so I hadnt left a track  I
followed around to see  I stood on the bank and looked out over the
river  All safe  So I took the gun and went up a piece into the woods
and was hunting around for some birds when I see a wild pig hogs soon
went wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairie farms
I shot this fellow and took him into camp

I took the axe and smashed in the door  I beat it and hacked it
considerable adoing it  I fetched the pig in and took him back nearly
to the table and hacked into his throat with the axe and laid him down
on the ground to bleed I say ground because it was groundhard packed
and no boards  Well next I took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks
in itall I could dragand I started it from the pig and dragged it
to the door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in and
down it sunk out of sight  You could easy see that something had been
dragged over the ground  I did wish Tom Sawyer was there I knowed he
would take an interest in this kind of business and throw in the fancy
touches  Nobody could spread himself like Tom Sawyer in such a thing as
that

Well last I pulled out some of my hair and blooded the axe good and
stuck it on the back side and slung the axe in the corner  Then I took
up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket so he couldnt drip
till I got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into the
river  Now I thought of something else  So I went and got the bag of
meal and my old saw out of the canoe and fetched them to the house  I
took the bag to where it used to stand and ripped a hole in the bottom
of it with the saw for there warnt no knives and forks on the place
pap done everything with his claspknife about the cooking  Then I
carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through the
willows east of the house to a shallow lake that was five mile wide and
full of rushesand ducks too you might say in the season  There was a
slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went miles
away I dont know where but it didnt go to the river  The meal sifted
out and made a little track all the way to the lake  I dropped paps
whetstone there too so as to look like it had been done by accident
Then I tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string so it wouldnt
leak no more and took it and my saw to the canoe again

It was about dark now so I dropped the canoe down the river under some
willows that hung over the bank and waited for the moon to rise  I made
fast to a willow then I took a bite to eat and by and by laid down in
the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan  I says to myself theyll
follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then drag the
river for me  And theyll follow that meal track to the lake and go
browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers that
killed me and took the things  They wont ever hunt the river for
anything but my dead carcass Theyll soon get tired of that and wont
bother no more about me  All right I can stop anywhere I want to
Jacksons Island is good enough for me I know that island pretty well
and nobody ever comes there  And then I can paddle over to town nights
and slink around and pick up things I want Jacksons Islands the place

I was pretty tired and the first thing I knowed I was asleep  When I
woke up I didnt know where I was for a minute  I set up and looked
around a little scared  Then I remembered  The river looked miles and
miles across  The moon was so bright I could a counted the drift logs
that went aslipping along black and still hundreds of yards out from
shore Everything was dead quiet and it looked late and SMELT late
You know what I meanI dont know the words to put it in

I took a good gap and a stretch and was just going to unhitch and start
when I heard a sound away over the water  I listened  Pretty soon I
made it out  It was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from
oars working in rowlocks when its a still night  I peeped out through
the willow branches and there it wasa skiff away across the water  I
couldnt tell how many was in it  It kept acoming and when it was
abreast of me I see there warnt but one man in it  Thinks I maybe
its pap though I warnt expecting him  He dropped below me with the
current and by and by he came aswinging up shore in the easy water and
he went by so close I could a reached out the gun and touched him  Well
it WAS pap sure enoughand sober too by the way he laid his oars

I didnt lose no time  The next minute I was aspinning down stream soft
but quick in the shade of the bank  I made two mile and a half and then
struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle of the river
because pretty soon I would be passing the ferry landing and people
might see me and hail me  I got out amongst the driftwood and then laid
down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float  I laid there and had
a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe looking away into the sky not a
cloud in it  The sky looks ever so deep when you lay down on your back
in the moonshine I never knowed it before  And how far a body can hear
on the water such nights  I heard people talking at the ferry landing
I heard what they said tooevery word of it  One man said it was
getting towards the long days and the short nights now  Tother one said
THIS warnt one of the short ones he reckonedand then they laughed
and he said it over again and they laughed again then they waked up
another fellow and told him and laughed but he didnt laugh he ripped
out something brisk and said let him alone  The first fellow said he
lowed to tell it to his old womanshe would think it was pretty good
but he said that warnt nothing to some things he had said in his time
I heard one man say it was nearly three oclock and he hoped daylight
wouldnt wait more than about a week longer  After that the talk got
further and further away and I couldnt make out the words any more but
I could hear the mumble and now and then a laugh too but it seemed a
long ways off

I was away below the ferry now  I rose up and there was Jacksons
Island about two mile and a half down stream heavy timbered and
standing up out of the middle of the river big and dark and solid like
a steamboat without any lights  There warnt any signs of the bar at the
headit was all under water now

It didnt take me long to get there  I shot past the head at a ripping
rate the current was so swift and then I got into the dead water and
landed on the side towards the Illinois shore  I run the canoe into a
deep dent in the bank that I knowed about I had to part the willow
branches to get in and when I made fast nobody could a seen the canoe
from the outside

I went up and set down on a log at the head of the island and looked out
on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town three
mile away where there was three or four lights twinkling  A monstrous
big lumberraft was about a mile up stream coming along down with a
lantern in the middle of it  I watched it come creeping down and when
it was most abreast of where I stood I heard a man say Stern oars
there heave her head to stabboard  I heard that just as plain as if
the man was by my side

There was a little gray in the sky now so I stepped into the woods and
laid down for a nap before breakfast




CHAPTER VIII

THE sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it was after eight
oclock  I laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about
things and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied  I could
see the sun out at one or two holes but mostly it was big trees all
about and gloomy in there amongst them  There was freckled places on
the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves and the
freckled places swapped about a little showing there was a little breeze
up there  A couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me very
friendly

I was powerful lazy and comfortabledidnt want to get up and cook
breakfast  Well I was dozing off again when I thinks I hears a deep
sound of boom away up the river  I rouses up and rests on my elbow
and listens pretty soon I hears it again  I hopped up and went and
looked out at a hole in the leaves and I see a bunch of smoke laying on
the water a long ways upabout abreast the ferry  And there was the
ferryboat full of people floating along down  I knowed what was the
matter now  Boom I see the white smoke squirt out of the ferryboats
side  You see they was firing cannon over the water trying to make my
carcass come to the top

I was pretty hungry but it warnt going to do for me to start a fire
because they might see the smoke  So I set there and watched the
cannonsmoke and listened to the boom  The river was a mile wide there
and it always looks pretty on a summer morningso I was having a good
enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had a bite to
eat Well then I happened to think how they always put quicksilver in
loaves of bread and float them off because they always go right to the
drownded carcass and stop there  So says I Ill keep a lookout and if
any of thems floating around after me Ill give them a show  I changed
to the Illinois edge of the island to see what luck I could have and I
warnt disappointed  A big double loaf come along and I most got it
with a long stick but my foot slipped and she floated out further  Of
course I was where the current set in the closest to the shoreI knowed
enough for that  But by and by along comes another one and this time I
won  I took out the plug and shook out the little dab of quicksilver
and set my teeth in  It was bakers breadwhat the quality eat none
of your lowdown cornpone

I got a good place amongst the leaves and set there on a log munching
the bread and watching the ferryboat and very well satisfied  And then
something struck me  I says now I reckon the widow or the parson or
somebody prayed that this bread would find me and here it has gone and
done it  So there aint no doubt but there is something in that thing
that is theres something in it when a body like the widow or the parson
prays but it dont work for me and I reckon it dont work for only just
the right kind

I lit a pipe and had a good long smoke and went on watching  The
ferryboat was floating with the current and I allowed Id have a chance
to see who was aboard when she come along because she would come in
close where the bread did  When shed got pretty well along down
towards me I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out the bread
and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place  Where the
log forked I could peep through

By and by she come along and she drifted in so close that they could a
run out a plank and walked ashore  Most everybody was on the boat  Pap
and Judge Thatcher and Bessie Thatcher and Jo Harper and Tom Sawyer
and his old Aunt Polly and Sid and Mary and plenty more  Everybody was
talking about the murder but the captain broke in and says

Look sharp now the current sets in the closest here and maybe hes
washed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the waters edge  I
hope so anyway

I didnt hope so  They all crowded up and leaned over the rails nearly
in my face and kept still watching with all their might  I could see
them firstrate but they couldnt see me  Then the captain sung out

Stand away and the cannon let off such a blast right before me that it
made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke and I
judged I was gone  If theyd a had some bullets in I reckon theyd a
got the corpse they was after  Well I see I warnt hurt thanks to
goodness The boat floated on and went out of sight around the shoulder
of the island  I could hear the booming now and then further and
further off and by and by after an hour I didnt hear it no more  The
island was three mile long  I judged they had got to the foot and was
giving it up  But they didnt yet a while  They turned around the foot
of the island and started up the channel on the Missouri side under
steam and booming once in a while as they went  I crossed over to that
side and watched them When they got abreast the head of the island they
quit shooting and dropped over to the Missouri shore and went home to the
town

I knowed I was all right now  Nobody else would come ahunting after me
I got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick
woods  I made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my things under
so the rain couldnt get at them  I catched a catfish and haggled him
open with my saw and towards sundown I started my camp fire and had
supper  Then I set out a line to catch some fish for breakfast

When it was dark I set by my camp fire smoking and feeling pretty well
satisfied but by and by it got sort of lonesome and so I went and set
on the bank and listened to the current swashing along and counted the
stars and drift logs and rafts that come down and then went to bed
there aint no better way to put in time when you are lonesome you cant
stay so you soon get over it

And so for three days and nights  No differencejust the same thing
But the next day I went exploring around down through the island  I was
boss of it it all belonged to me so to say and I wanted to know all
about it but mainly I wanted to put in the time  I found plenty
strawberries ripe and prime and green summer grapes and green
razberries and the green blackberries was just beginning to show  They
would all come handy by and by I judged

Well I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I warnt far
from the foot of the island  I had my gun along but I hadnt shot
nothing it was for protection thought I would kill some game nigh home
About this time I mighty near stepped on a goodsized snake and it went
sliding off through the grass and flowers and I after it trying to get
a shot at it I clipped along and all of a sudden I bounded right on to
the ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking

My heart jumped up amongst my lungs  I never waited for to look further
but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as fast as ever
I could  Every now and then I stopped a second amongst the thick leaves
and listened but my breath come so hard I couldnt hear nothing else  I
slunk along another piece further then listened again and so on and so
on  If I see a stump I took it for a man if I trod on a stick and
broke it it made me feel like a person had cut one of my breaths in two
and I only got half and the short half too

When I got to camp I warnt feeling very brash there warnt much sand in
my craw but I says this aint no time to be fooling around  So I got
all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight and I
put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an old last
years camp and then clumb a tree

I reckon I was up in the tree two hours but I didnt see nothing I
didnt hear nothingI only THOUGHT I heard and seen as much as a
thousand things  Well I couldnt stay up there forever so at last I
got down but I kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the time
All I could get to eat was berries and what was left over from breakfast

By the time it was night I was pretty hungry  So when it was good and
dark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the
Illinois bankabout a quarter of a mile  I went out in the woods and
cooked a supper and I had about made up my mind I would stay there all
night when I hear a PLUNKETYPLUNK PLUNKETYPLUNK and says to myself
horses coming and next I hear peoples voices  I got everything into
the canoe as quick as I could and then went creeping through the woods
to see what I could find out  I hadnt got far when I hear a man say

We better camp here if we can find a good place the horses is about
beat out  Lets look around

I didnt wait but shoved out and paddled away easy  I tied up in the
old place and reckoned I would sleep in the canoe

I didnt sleep much  I couldnt somehow for thinking  And every time
I waked up I thought somebody had me by the neck  So the sleep didnt do
me no good  By and by I says to myself I cant live this way Im
agoing to find out who it is thats here on the island with me Ill
find it out or bust  Well I felt better right off

So I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two and then
let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows  The moon was shining
and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day  I poked
along well on to an hour everything still as rocks and sound asleep
Well by this time I was most down to the foot of the island  A little
ripply cool breeze begun to blow and that was as good as saying the
night was about done  I give her a turn with the paddle and brung her
nose to shore then I got my gun and slipped out and into the edge of the
woods  I sat down there on a log and looked out through the leaves  I
see the moon go off watch and the darkness begin to blanket the river
But in a little while I see a pale streak over the treetops and knowed
the day was coming  So I took my gun and slipped off towards where I had
run across that camp fire stopping every minute or two to listen  But I
hadnt no luck somehow I couldnt seem to find the place  But by and
by sure enough I catched a glimpse of fire away through the trees  I
went for it cautious and slow  By and by I was close enough to have a
look and there laid a man on the ground  It most give me the fantods
He had a blanket around his head and his head was nearly in the fire  I
set there behind a clump of bushes in about six foot of him and kept my
eyes on him steady  It was getting gray daylight now  Pretty soon he
gapped and stretched himself and hove off the blanket and it was Miss
Watsons Jim  I bet I was glad to see him  I says

Hello Jim and skipped out

He bounced up and stared at me wild  Then he drops down on his knees
and puts his hands together and says

Doan hurt medont  I haint ever done no harm to a ghos  I alwuz
liked dead people en done all I could for em  You go en git in de
river agin whah you blongs en doan do nuffn to Ole Jim at uz awluz
yo fren

Well I warnt long making him understand I warnt dead  I was ever so
glad to see Jim  I warnt lonesome now  I told him I warnt afraid of
HIM telling the people where I was  I talked along but he only set
there and looked at me never said nothing  Then I says

Its good daylight  Les get breakfast  Make up your camp fire good

Whats de use er makin up de camp fire to cook strawbries en sich
truck But you got a gun haint you  Den we kin git sumfn better den
strawbries

Strawberries and such truck I says  Is that what you live on

I couldn git nuffn else he says

islan

Since the night I got killed

No  Wy what has you lived on  But you got a gun  Oh yes you got a
gun  Dats good  Now you kill sumfn en Ill make up de fire

So we went over to where the canoe was and while he built a fire in a
grassy open place amongst the trees I fetched meal and bacon and coffee
and coffeepot and fryingpan and sugar and tin cups and the nigger was
set back considerable because he reckoned it was all done with
witchcraft I catched a good big catfish too and Jim cleaned him with
his knife and fried him

When breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot
Jim laid it in with all his might for he was most about starved  Then
when we had got pretty well stuffed we laid off and lazied  By and by
Jim says

But looky here Huck who wuz it dat uz killed in dat shanty ef it
warnt you

Then I told him the whole thing and he said it was smart  He said Tom
Sawyer couldnt get up no better plan than what I had  Then I says

How do you come to be here Jim and howd you get here

He looked pretty uneasy and didnt say nothing for a minute  Then he
says

Maybe I better not tell

Why Jim

Well deys reasons  But you wouldn tell on me ef I uz to tell you
would you Huck

Blamed if I would Jim

Well I blieve you Huck  II RUN OFF

Jim

But mind you said you wouldn tellyou know you said you wouldn tell

De yuther servants wouldn miss me kase deyd shin out en take holiday

Well when it come dark I tuck out up de river road en went bout two

Well thats so  Youve had to keep in the woods all the time of
course Did you hear em shooting the cannon

Oh yes  I knowed dey was arter you  I see um go by heahwatched um
thoo de bushes

Some young birds come along flying a yard or two at a time and lighting
Jim said it was a sign it was going to rain  He said it was a sign when
young chickens flew that way and so he reckoned it was the same way when
young birds done it  I was going to catch some of them but Jim wouldnt
let me  He said it was death  He said his father laid mighty sick once
and some of them catched a bird and his old granny said his father would
die and he did

And Jim said you mustnt count the things you are going to cook for
dinner because that would bring bad luck  The same if you shook the
tablecloth after sundown  And he said if a man owned a beehive and that
man died the bees must be told about it before sunup next morning or
else the bees would all weaken down and quit work and die  Jim said bees
wouldnt sting idiots but I didnt believe that because I had tried
them lots of times myself and they wouldnt sting me

I had heard about some of these things before but not all of them  Jim
knowed all kinds of signs  He said he knowed most everything  I said it
looked to me like all the signs was about bad luck and so I asked him if
there warnt any goodluck signs  He says

Mighty fewan DEY aint no use to a body  What you want to know when
good lucks acomin for  Want to keep it off  And he said  Ef yous
got hairy arms en a hairy breas its a sign dat yous agwyne to be
rich Well deys some use in a sign like dat kase its so fur ahead
You see maybe yous got to be po a long time fust en so you might git

eight hundd dollars  I wisht I had de money I wouldn want no mo




CHAPTER IX

I WANTED to go and look at a place right about the middle of the island
that Id found when I was exploring so we started and soon got to it
because the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a mile
wide

This place was a tolerable long steep hill or ridge about forty foot
high We had a rough time getting to the top the sides was so steep and
the bushes so thick  We tramped and clumb around all over it and by and
by found a good big cavern in the rock most up to the top on the side
towards Illinois  The cavern was as big as two or three rooms bunched
together and Jim could stand up straight in it  It was cool in there
Jim was for putting our traps in there right away but I said we didnt
want to be climbing up and down there all the time

Jim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place and had all the traps
in the cavern we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island
and they would never find us without dogs  And besides he said them
little birds had said it was going to rain and did I want the things to
get wet

So we went back and got the canoe and paddled up abreast the cavern and
lugged all the traps up there  Then we hunted up a place close by to
hide the canoe in amongst the thick willows  We took some fish off of
the lines and set them again and begun to get ready for dinner

The door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in and on one
side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit and was flat and a
good place to build a fire on  So we built it there and cooked dinner

We spread the blankets inside for a carpet and eat our dinner in there
We put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern  Pretty soon
it darkened up and begun to thunder and lighten so the birds was right
about it  Directly it begun to rain and it rained like all fury too
and I never see the wind blow so  It was one of these regular summer
storms  It would get so dark that it looked all blueblack outside and
lovely and the rain would thrash along by so thick that the trees off a
little ways looked dim and spiderwebby and here would come a blast of
wind that would bend the trees down and turn up the pale underside of the
leaves and then a perfect ripper of a gust would follow along and set
the branches to tossing their arms as if they was just wild and next
when it was just about the bluest and blackestFST it was as bright as
glory and youd have a little glimpse of treetops aplunging about away
off yonder in the storm hundreds of yards further than you could see
before dark as sin again in a second and now youd hear the thunder let
go with an awful crash and then go rumbling grumbling tumbling down
the sky towards the under side of the world like rolling empty barrels
down stairswhere its long stairs and they bounce a good deal you
know

Jim this is nice I says  I wouldnt want to be nowhere else but
here Pass me along another hunk of fish and some hot cornbread

Well you wouldnt a ben here f it hadnt a ben for Jim  Youd a ben
down dah in de woods widout any dinner en gittn mos drownded too dat
you would honey  Chickens knows when its gwyne to rain en so do de
birds chile

The river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days till at
last it was over the banks  The water was three or four foot deep on the
island in the low places and on the Illinois bottom  On that side it was
a good many miles wide but on the Missouri side it was the same old
distance acrossa half a milebecause the Missouri shore was just a
wall of high bluffs

Daytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe It was mighty cool
and shady in the deep woods even if the sun was blazing outside  We
went winding in and out amongst the trees and sometimes the vines hung
so thick we had to back away and go some other way  Well on every old
brokendown tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things and
when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame on
account of being hungry that you could paddle right up and put your hand
on them if you wanted to but not the snakes and turtlesthey would
slide off in the water  The ridge our cavern was in was full of them
We could a had pets enough if wed wanted them

One night we catched a little section of a lumber raftnice pine planks
It was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long and the
top stood above water six or seven inchesa solid level floor  We
could see sawlogs go by in the daylight sometimes but we let them go
we didnt show ourselves in daylight

Another night when we was up at the head of the island just before
daylight here comes a framehouse down on the west side  She was a
twostory and tilted over considerable  We paddled out and got aboard
clumb in at an upstairs window  But it was too dark to see yet so we
made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight

The light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island  Then we
looked in at the window  We could make out a bed and a table and two
old chairs and lots of things around about on the floor and there was
clothes hanging against the wall  There was something laying on the
floor in the far corner that looked like a man  So Jim says

Hello you

But it didnt budge  So I hollered again and then Jim says

De man aint asleephes dead  You hold stillIll go en see

He went and bent down and looked and says

Its a dead man  Yes indeedy naked too  Hes ben shot in de back
I reckn hes ben dead two er three days  Come in Huck but doan look
at his faceits too gashly

I didnt look at him at all  Jim throwed some old rags over him but he
neednt done it I didnt want to see him  There was heaps of old greasy
cards scattered around over the floor and old whisky bottles and a
couple of masks made out of black cloth and all over the walls was the
ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal  There was two
old dirty calico dresses and a sunbonnet and some womens underclothes
hanging against the wall and some mens clothing too  We put the lot
into the canoeit might come good  There was a boys old speckled straw
hat on the floor I took that too  And there was a bottle that had had
milk in it and it had a rag stopper for a baby to suck  We would a took
the bottle but it was broke  There was a seedy old chest and an old
hair trunk with the hinges broke  They stood open but there warnt
nothing left in them that was any account  The way things was scattered
about we reckoned the people left in a hurry and warnt fixed so as to
carry off most of their stuff

We got an old tin lantern and a butcherknife without any handle and a
brannew Barlow knife worth two bits in any store and a lot of tallow
candles and a tin candlestick and a gourd and a tin cup and a ratty
old bedquilt off the bed and a reticule with needles and pins and
beeswax and buttons and thread and all such truck in it and a hatchet
and some nails and a fishline as thick as my little finger with some
monstrous hooks on it and a roll of buckskin and a leather dogcollar
and a horseshoe and some vials of medicine that didnt have no label on
them and just as we was leaving I found a tolerable good currycomb and
Jim he found a ratty old fiddlebow and a wooden leg  The straps was
broke off of it but barring that it was a good enough leg though it
was too long for me and not long enough for Jim and we couldnt find the
other one though we hunted all around

And so take it all around we made a good haul  When we was ready to
shove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island and it was pretty
broad day so I made Jim lay down in the canoe and cover up with the
quilt because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a good ways
off  I paddled over to the Illinois shore and drifted down most a half
a mile doing it  I crept up the dead water under the bank and hadnt no
accidents and didnt see nobody  We got home all safe




CHAPTER X

AFTER breakfast I wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how he
come to be killed but Jim didnt want to  He said it would fetch bad
luck and besides he said he might come and hant us he said a man
that warnt buried was more likely to go ahanting around than one that
was planted and comfortable  That sounded pretty reasonable so I didnt
say no more but I couldnt keep from studying over it and wishing I
knowed who shot the man and what they done it for

We rummaged the clothes wed got and found eight dollars in silver sewed
up in the lining of an old blanket overcoat  Jim said he reckoned the
people in that house stole the coat because if theyd a knowed the money
was there they wouldnt a left it  I said I reckoned they killed him
too but Jim didnt want to talk about that  I says

Now you think its bad luck but what did you say when I fetched in the
snakeskin that I found on the top of the ridge day before yesterday
You said it was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a snakeskin
with my hands  Well heres your bad luck  Weve raked in all this
truck and eight dollars besides  I wish we could have some bad luck like
this every day Jim

Never you mind honey never you mind  Dont you git too peart  Its
acomin  Mind I tell you its acomin

It did come too  It was a Tuesday that we had that talk  Well after
dinner Friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of the
ridge and got out of tobacco  I went to the cavern to get some and
found a rattlesnake in there  I killed him and curled him up on the
foot of Jims blanket ever so natural thinking thered be some fun when
Jim found him there  Well by night I forgot all about the snake and
when Jim flung himself down on the blanket while I struck a light the
snakes mate was there and bit him

He jumped up yelling and the first thing the light showed was the
varmint curled up and ready for another spring  I laid him out in a
second with a stick and Jim grabbed paps whiskyjug and begun to pour
it down

He was barefooted and the snake bit him right on the heel  That all
comes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave
a dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it  Jim told
me to chop off the snakes head and throw it away and then skin the body
and roast a piece of it  I done it and he eat it and said it would help
cure him He made me take off the rattles and tie them around his wrist
too  He said that that would help  Then I slid out quiet and throwed
the snakes clear away amongst the bushes for I warnt going to let Jim
find out it was all my fault not if I could help it

Jim sucked and sucked at the jug and now and then he got out of his head
and pitched around and yelled but every time he come to himself he went
to sucking at the jug again  His foot swelled up pretty big and so did
his leg but by and by the drunk begun to come and so I judged he was
all right but Id druther been bit with a snake than paps whisky

Jim was laid up for four days and nights  Then the swelling was all gone
and he was around again  I made up my mind I wouldnt ever take aholt
of a snakeskin again with my hands now that I see what had come of it
Jim said he reckoned I would believe him next time  And he said that
handling a snakeskin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadnt got to
the end of it yet  He said he druther see the new moon over his left
shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snakeskin in his
hand  Well I was getting to feel that way myself though Ive always
reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder is one of
the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do  Old Hank Bunker
done it once and bragged about it and in less than two years he got
drunk and fell off of the shottower and spread himself out so that he
was just a kind of a layer as you may say and they slid him edgeways
between two barn doors for a coffin and buried him so so they say but
I didnt see it  Pap told me  But anyway it all come of looking at the
moon that way like a fool

Well the days went along and the river went down between its banks
again and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big hooks
with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was as big as a
man being six foot two inches long and weighed over two hundred pounds
We couldnt handle him of course he would a flung us into Illinois  We
just set there and watched him rip and tear around till he drownded  We
found a brass button in his stomach and a round ball and lots of
rubbage  We split the ball open with the hatchet and there was a spool
in it  Jim said hed had it there a long time to coat it over so and
make a ball of it  It was as big a fish as was ever catched in the
Mississippi I reckon  Jim said he hadnt ever seen a bigger one  He
would a been worth a good deal over at the village  They peddle out such
a fish as that by the pound in the markethouse there everybody buys
some of him his meats as white as snow and makes a good fry

Next morning I said it was getting slow and dull and I wanted to get a
stirring up some way  I said I reckoned I would slip over the river and
find out what was going on  Jim liked that notion but he said I must go
in the dark and look sharp  Then he studied it over and said couldnt I
put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl  That was a good
notion too  So we shortened up one of the calico gowns and I turned up
my trouserlegs to my knees and got into it  Jim hitched it behind with
the hooks and it was a fair fit  I put on the sunbonnet and tied it
under my chin and then for a body to look in and see my face was like
looking down a joint of stovepipe  Jim said nobody would know me even
in the daytime hardly  I practiced around all day to get the hang of
the things and by and by I could do pretty well in them only Jim said I
didnt walk like a girl and he said I must quit pulling up my gown to
get at my britchespocket  I took notice and done better

I started up the Illinois shore in the canoe just after dark

I started across to the town from a little below the ferrylanding and
the drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town  I tied
up and started along the bank  There was a light burning in a little
shanty that hadnt been lived in for a long time and I wondered who had
took up quarters there  I slipped up and peeped in at the window  There
was a woman about forty year old in there knitting by a candle that was
on a pine table  I didnt know her face she was a stranger for you
couldnt start a face in that town that I didnt know  Now this was
lucky because I was weakening I was getting afraid I had come people
might know my voice and find me out  But if this woman had been in such
a little town two days she could tell me all I wanted to know so I
knocked at the door and made up my mind I wouldnt forget I was a girl
