  A Lowden Sabbath Morn


    I

  The clinkumclank o Sabbath bells
  Noo to the hoastin rookery swells
  Noo faintin laigh in shady dells
          Sounds far an near
  An through the simmer kintry tells
          Its tale o cheer


    II

  An noo to that melodious play
  A deidly awn the quiet sway
  A ken their solemn holiday
          Bestial an human
  The singin lintie on the brae
          The restin plouman


    III

  He mair than a the lave o men
  His week completit joys to ken
  Halfdressed he daunders out an in
          Perplext wi leisure
  An his raxt limbs hell rax again
          Wi painf pleesure


      IV

  The steerin mither strang afit
  Noo shoos the bairnies but a bit
  Noo cries them ben their Sinday shit
          To scart upon them
  Or sweeties in their pouch to pit
          Wi blessins on them


    V

  The lasses clean frae tap to taes
  Are busked in crunklin underclaes
  The gartened hose the weelfilled stays
          The nakit shift
  A bleached on bonny greens for days
          An whites the drift


    VI

  An noo to face the kirkward mile
  The guidmans hat o dacent style
  The blackit shoon we noo maun fyle
          As whites the miller
  A waef peety tae to spile
          The warth o siller


    VII

  Our Marget aye sae keen to crack
  Doucestappin in the stoury track
  Her emeralt goun a kiltit back
          Frae snawy coats
  Whiteankled leads the kirkward pack
          Wi Dauvit Groats


    VIII

  A thocht ahint in runkled breeks
  A spiled wi lyin by for weeks
  The guidman follows closs an cleiks
          The sonsie missis
  His sarious face at aince bespeaks
          The day that this is


    IX

  And aye an while we nearer draw
  To whaur the kirkton lies alaw
  Mair neebours comin saft an slaw
          Frae here an there
  The thicker thrang the gate an caw
          The stour in air


    X

  But hark the bells frae nearer clang
  To rowst the slaw their sides they bang
  An see black coats aready thrang
          The green kirkyaird
  And at the yett the chestnuts spang
          That brocht the laird


    XI

  The solemn elders at the plate
  Stand drinkin deep the pride o state
  The practised hands as gash an great
          As Lords o Session
  The later named a wee thing blate
          In their expression


    XII

  The prentit stanes that mark the deid
  Wi lengthened lip the sarious read
  Syne wag a moraleesin heid
          An then an there
  Their hirplin practice an their creed
          Try hard to square


    XIII

  Its here our Merren lang has lain
  A wee bewast the tablestane
  An yons the grave o Sandy Blane
          An further ower
  The mithers brithers dacent men
          Lie a the fower


    XIV

  Here the guidman sall bide awee
  To dwall amang the deid to see
  Auld faces clear in fancys ee
          Belike to hear
  Auld voices fain saft an slee
          On fancys ear


    XV

  Thus on the day o solemn things
  The bell that in the steeple swings
  To fauld a scaittered faimly rings
          Its walcome screed
  An just a wee thing nearer brings
          The quick an deid


    XVI

  But noo the bell is ringin in
  To tak their places folk begin
  The minister himsel will shne
          Be up the gate
  Filled fu wi clavers about sin
          An mans estate


    XVII

  The tnes are upFrench to be shre
  The faithf French an twathree mair
  The auld prezentor hoastin sair
          Wales out the portions
  An yirks the tne into the air
          Wi queer contortions


    XVIII

  Follows the prayer the readin next
  An than the fisslin for the text
  The twathree last to find it vext
          But kind o proud
  An than the peppermints are raxed
          An southernwood


    XIX

  For noos the time whan pows are seen
  Nidnoddin like a mandareen
  When tenty mithers stap a preen
          In sleepin weans
  An nearly half the parochine
          Forget their pains


    XX

  Theres just a waukrif twa or three
  Thrawn commentautors sweer to gree
  Weans glowrin at the bumlin bee
          On windieglasses
  Or lads that tak a keek aglee
          At sonsie lasses


    XXI

  Himsel meanwhile frae whaur he cocks
  An bobs belaw the soundinbox
  The treesures of his words unlocks
          Wi prodigality
  An deals some unco dingin knocks
          To infidality


    XXII

  Wi sappy unction hoo he burkes
  The hopes o men that trust in works
  Expounds the fauts o ither kirks
          An shaws the best o them
  No muckle better than mere Turks
          When as confessed o them


    XXIII

  Bethankit what a bonny creed
  What mair would ony Christian need
  The braw words rummle ower his heid
          Nor steer the sleeper
  And in their restin graves the deid
          Sleep aye the deeper




  AUTHORS NOTE


It may be guessed by some that I had a certain parish in my eye and
this makes it proper I should add a word of disclamation In my time
there have been two ministers in that parish Of the first I have a
special reason to speak well even had there been any to think ill The
second I have often met in private and long in the due phrase sat
under in his church and neither here nor there have I heard an unkind
or ugly word upon his lips The preacher of the text had thus no
original in that particular parish but when I was a boy he might have
been observed in many others he was then like the schoolmaster
abroad and by recent advices it would seem he has not yet entirely
disappeared




  ILLUSTRATORS NOTE


I am not certain of the particular parish Stevenson had in his mind when
he wrote this poem but I am certain that the description is typical of
almost any Scottish rural parish Lowden that is Lothian or other
In illustrating the verses it has seemed to me therefore unnecessary
to make portraits from any one locality I fancy the writer looked back
to the period of his boyhood and to the people he knew in more than one
part of his native country so I have tried to depict that period and
that class of people as I remember them in various counties of his land
and mine

Section   Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment  Many small donations
 to  are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all  states of the United
States  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States  US laws alone swamp our small staff

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks online payments and credit card
donations  To donate please visit httppglaforgdonate


Section   General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone  For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support


Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included  Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility

     httpwwwgutenbergnet

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to
