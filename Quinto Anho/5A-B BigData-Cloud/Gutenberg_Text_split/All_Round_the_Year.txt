  All round the year the changing suns and rains
    Beat on mens workto wreck and to decay
    But nature builds more perfectly than they
  Her changing unchanged sea resists remains

  All round the year new flowers spring up to shew
    How gloriously life is more strong than death
    And in our hearts are seeds of love and faith
  Ah sun and showers be kind and let them grow

RESURGAM

  Swift pass the hours or lengthened by our hearts
    Uncertain measurement of time
  And when we dream the year has just awoke
    We wake to find her in her prime

  We sadden with the dying Autumn leaves
    Yet falling seeds their promise bring
  Through long dark Winter days we only wait
    A resurrection in the coming Spring

  Within each hour the precious minutes lie
    Like seeds awaiting Springs first breath
  Gods harvesttime shall show us if they bear
    The flowers of life or death

        Caris Brooke

  Illustration


  Cold is the earth the flowers below
    Fearful of Winters hand lie curled
  But Spring will come again you know
    And glorify the world

  Illustration

  Dark is the night no stars or moon
    But at its blackest night is done
  All after hastens to the noon
    The triumph of the sun

  And life is short and love is brief
    Be patient There will bethey say
  New life divine beyond belief
    Somewhere somehow some day

        E Nesbit

MARCH VIOLETS

  This busy dusty wind that blows
    Along the cruel streets
  Right to the heart of violets goes
    And robs them of their sweets
  And as along the cruel street
    The keen wind robs the flowers
  So the cold kindness that we meet
    Blights these poor hearts of ours

  But if you tend with warmth you know
    Your violets they give
  Sweet scent again as if to show
    How glad they are to live
  We think if some one loved us too
    Our hearts would break to prove
  By all that we could say or do
    How glad we were to love

        E Nesbit


  Illustration


  Dream footsteps wandering past us in our sleep
  A restless presence stirring with the light
  The cry of waters where the snow was white
  A violets whisper where dead leaves lay deep
  The dim woods music makes a sudden leap
  Broken notes blending in a wild delight
  And lo the whole world changes in our sight
  Promise is endedwe must turn and reap
  Fulfilment for the Spring with all her wealth
  Is with us and compels us to her will
  Yet if the sundawn we should shun by stealth
  Yearning for shadows and the darkened hours
  Sweet Lord be pitiful remembering still
  One lieth low beneath the budding flowers

        Caris Brooke


  Illustration


  Never a hand on the cottage door
    To call me forth in the evening light
  My days grow old and I watch no more
    The cowslips gold and the maybuds white
  Primroses nestle beneath the hedge
    Where we kissed and wept and said goodbye
  For twenty years I have watched them bud
    For twenty years I have seen them die

  Yet now that the Spring once more has turned
    The sea to silver the earth to gold
  I shall watch no more from the primrose lane
    Where I waited and watched in the days of old
  Yet the children weave me their daisy chains
    The woodland music is sweet and clear
  Though the footsteps have wandered beyond recall
    That I watched and waited so long to hear

        Caris Brooke


  Illustration


  The swans along the water glide
  Unfettered and yet side by side
  So should true lovers ever be
  Together everever free

  A chain upon the white swans neck
  What were it good forsave to break
  And swans who wear and break a chain
  Swim never side by side again


  Illustration


  My best beloved the Spring is fair
    The woods are green and life is good
  Come out with me and let us tread
    By field and fold and sweet wet wood
  The windflower blanches all the copse
    With hyacinth the hedge is blue
  And every wakened leaf is fair
    But not so fair as you

  The blackbirds sing on hazel boughs
    Beneath the overarching trees
  The cuckoos distant song is borne
    Across the meadow by the breeze
  The thrushs song is sweetest far
    But saddens as the hours go by
  You hear The nightingales in love
    But not so much as I

        E Nesbit


  Illustration


  Girdled with gold my little ladys bower
  Stands at the portals of a world in flower
  And down her ways the changing blossoms mark
  How the Spring grows each day from dawn to dark

  Illustration

  When forth she moves her dainty foot is set
  On cowslip hyacinth and violet
  And all day long the woodland minstrels sing
  Changes of measure for her pleasuring

  And all night long a passionate music stirs
  Without her wallsthe darkened belt of firs
  Hushed in their waving boughs the low winds brood
  Murmuring the seas song for an interlude

        Caris Brooke


  Illustration


  The last bright relic of the moons full gold
    Burns on the swiftly flowing rivers breast
  No sound but restless dipping of strong oars
    To break the charm of natures perfect rest

  Far off the towns faint mingled clamours stir
    And through the silence of the nearer light
  The incense of the evening mist floats up
    The days last lingering loveword to the night

  A sudden shiver of regretful change
    Sighs through the whispering boughs that overhead
  Sway in the winds breath down the red sun dips
    And in the twilights arms the day lies dead

  Then rain and after moonshine cold and fair
    And scent of earth sweet with the evening rain
  And slow soft speech beneath the rainwashed trees
    Ah that such things should never come again

  Illustration

  Oh listening trees where are the words we spoke
  Where are our sighs wind whom those sighs caressed
  Oh what a fate is ours too swift too sad
  If such an hour goes by with all the rest

        E Nesbit


  Illustration


  What oclock is it children dear
  Ask of the dandelions here
  Blow blow blow and away they go
  But they do not tell us the time you know

  Say what month is it children dear
  We think it is August because we hear
  The swing of the sickle restless and slow
  And thats a sign of the month you know

  Illustration

  Where are you going children dear
  Where the lane winds deep and the stream runs clear
  There are plenty of beautiful ways to go
  But only one way that two only know

  Where are we going children dear
  To a beautiful country thats very near
  Hand in hand is the way to go
  Up into fairyland you know

        E Nesbit


  Illustration

HOP PICKING

  Ah me how pleasant to go down
  From the forlorn and faded town
  To Kentish wood and fold and lane
  And breathe Gods blessed air again
  Where glorious yellow cornfields blaze
  And nuts hang over woodland ways

  To pick the sweet keenscented hops
  See from each pole a dreamwreath drops
  To toil all day in pure clear air
  Laughter and sunshine everywhere
  With reddening woods and sweet wet soil
  And wellearned rest and honest toil


  Illustration


  Where do we fly under deep dark sky
      Over the moors we go
  Over the pool where quiet and cool
      Bulrush and sedges grow
  And what was the loveliest thing we met
          Ahwe forget

  We remember though all the firelit glow
      Of a great hearths gleam and glare
  And we looked for a space at each happy face
      And the love that was written there
  And that of all we have looked on yet
          We least forget


  Illustration Halloween


  Oh what a day all yellow and gray
  And so dark so dreary so foggy and thick
          That if I should meet
          In the street
          My sweet
          I might pass her by
          Risk that Not I
  Take me home out of danger then Quick feet quick


  Illustration


  Not Summers crown of scent the red rose weaves
  Nor hawthorn blossom over bloomstrewn grass
  Nor violets whisper when the children pass
  Nor lilac perfume in the soft May eves
  Nor newmown hay crisp scent of yellow sheaves
  Nor any scent that Springtime can amass
  And Summer squander such a magic has
  As scent of fresh wet earth and fallen leaves

  For sometimes lovers in November days
    When earth is grieving for the vanished sun
  Have trod dead leaves in chill and wintry ways
    And kissed and dreamed eternal Summer won
  Look back look back through memories deepening haze
    Seetwo who dreamed that dream and you were one

THE LOVER TO HIS LASS

  Dearest the Winter is here
    It will be sad so you said
    When no green leaves overhead
    Shadow the paths where we tread
  I said It still will be dear
    If we still meet
    O my sweet

  See how the seasons are kind
    See this December forget
    How to be weary and wet
    Hardly our June I regret
  Winter so comely I find
    Since you are here
    O my dear

  Sweetheart I sometimes believe
    Love not the sun makes us glad
    Even the mists were not sad
    If your soft handclasp I had
  Hearts sing though skies mourn and grieve
    All weathers fair
    If youre there

  Someday a home there shall be
    Love shall be sun of it sweet
    Joy shall be full and complete
    Sound of small voices and feet
  While like the sunshine for me
    You light up life
    Youmy wife


BEFORE PARTING

  Now surely is the hour come for farewell
  Now with the lessened light and darkened days
  Who now would tread the wild hills pathless ways
  We found so fair when Spring and Summers spell
  Made blind our hearts this parting to foretell
  Yet why while wan and wintry sunlight stays
  On perished gold of Autumn fields delays
  Your heart to speak while both our hearts rebel
  Together we have gathered through the year
  All that the year could give us of its best
  Is it not meet our parting should be here
  Now in the season drear of death and rest
  Yet since together we its joys have known
  How shall each meet the strange New Year alone
