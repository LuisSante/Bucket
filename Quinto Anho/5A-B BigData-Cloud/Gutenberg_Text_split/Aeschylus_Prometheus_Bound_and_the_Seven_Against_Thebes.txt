INTRODUCTION


schylus the first of the great Grecian writers of tragedy was born at
Eleusis in  BC He was the son of Euphorion who was probably a
wealthy owner of rich vineyards The poets early employment was to
watch the grapes and protect them from the ravages of men and other
animals and it is said that this occupation led to the development of
his dramatic genius It is more easy to believe that it was responsible
for the development of certain other less admirable qualities of the
poet

His first appearance as a tragic writer was in  BC and in  BC
he won a prize in the tragic contests He took part in the battle of
Marathon in  BC and also fought in the battle of Salamis in 
BC He visited Sicily twice and probably spent some time in that
country as the use of many Sicilian words in his later plays would
indicate

There is a curious story related as to his death which took place at
Gela in  BC It is said that an eagle mistaking his bald head for a
stone dropped a tortoise upon it in order to break its shell and that
the blow quite killed schylus Too much reliance should not be placed
upon this story

It is not known how many plays the poet wrote but only seven have been
preserved to us That these tragedies contain much that is undramatic is
undoubtedly true but it must be remembered that at the time he wrote
schylus found the drama in a very primitive state The persons
represented consisted of but a single actor who related some narrative
of mythological or legendary interest and a chorus who relieved the
monotony of such a performance by the interspersing of a few songs and
dances To schylus belongs the credit of creating the dialogue in the
Greek drama by the introduction of a second actor

In the following pages will be found a translation of two of the poets
greatest compositions viz the Prometheus Chained and the Seven
Against Thebes The first of these dramas has been designated The
sublimest poem and simplest tragedy of antiquity and the second while
probably an earlier work and containing much that is undramatic
presents such a splendid spectacle of true Grecian chivalry that it has
been regarded as the equal of anything which the author ever attempted

The characters represented in the Prometheus are Strength Force
Vulcan Prometheus Io daughter of Inachus Ocean and Mercury The play
opens with the appearance of Prometheus in company with Strength Force
and Vulcan who have been bidden to bind Prometheus with adamantine
fetters to the lofty cragged rocks of an untrodden Scythian desert
because he has offended Jupiter by stealing fire from heaven and
bestowing it upon mortals

Vulcan is loth to obey the mandates of Jove but urged on by Strength
and Force and the fear of the consequences which disobedience will
entail with mighty force drives the wedges into the adamantine rocks
and rivets the captive with galling shackles to the ruthless crags

Prometheus being bound and left alone bemoans his fate and relates to
the chorus of nymphs the base ingratitude of Jove who through his
counsels having overwhelmed the aged Saturn beneath the murky abyss of
Tartarus now rewards his ally with indignities because he had
compassion upon mortals

Ocean then comes to Prometheus offering sympathy and counsel urging
him not to utter words thus harsh and whetted lest Jupiter seated far
aloft may hear them and inflict upon him added woes to which his present
sufferings will seem but childs play

Ocean having taken his departure Prometheus again complains to the
chorus and enumerates the boons which he has bestowed upon mankind with
the comment that though he has discovered such inventions for mortals
he has no device whereby he may escape from his present misfortune

Io daughter of Inachus beloved by Jove but forced through the
jealous hatred of Juno to make many wanderings then appears and
beseeches Prometheus to discover to her what time shall be the limit of
her sufferings Prometheus accedes to her request and relates how she
shall wander over many lands and seas until she reaches the city of
Canopus at the mouth of the Nile where she shall bring forth a
Jovebegotten child from whose seed shall finally spring a dauntless
warrior renowned in archery who will liberate Prometheus from his
captivity and accomplish the downfall of Jove

Io then resumes her wanderings and Mercury sent by Jove comes to
question Prometheus as to the nuptials which he has boasted will
accomplish the overthrow of the ruler of the Gods Him Prometheus
reviles with opprobrious epithets calling him a lackey of the Gods and
refuses to disclose anything concerning the matter on which he questions
him The winged God replying threatens him with dire calamities A
tempest will come upon him and overwhelm him with thunderbolts and a
bloodthirsting eagle shall feed upon his liver Thus saying he departs
and immediately the earth commences to heave the noise of thunder is
heard vivid streaks of lightning blaze throughout the sky and a
hurricanethe onslaught of Jovesweeps Prometheus away in its blast

The Seven against Thebes includes in its cast of characters Eteocles
King of Thebes Antigone and Ismene Sisters of the King a Messenger
and a Herald The play opens with the siege of Thebes Eteocles appears
upon the Acropolis in the early morning and exhorts the citizens to be
brave and be not overdismayed at the rabble of alien besiegers A
messenger arrives and announces the rapid approach of the Argives
Eteocles goes to see that the battlements and the gates are properly
manned and during his absence the chorus of Theban maidens set up a
great wail of distress and burst forth with violent lamentations
Eteocles returning upbraids them severely for their weakness and bids
them begone and raise the sacred auspicious shout of the pan as an
encouragement to the Theban warriors He then departs to prepare himself
and six others to meet in combat the seven chieftains who have come
against the city

He soon reenters and at the same time comes the messenger from another
part of the city with fresh tidings of the foe and the arrangement of
the invaders around the walls of the city By the gate of Proetus
stands the raging Tydeus with his helm of hairy crests and his buckler
tricked out with a full moon and a gleaming sky full of stars against
whom Eteocles will marshal the wary son of Astacus a noble and a modest
youth who detests vain boastings and yet is not a coward

By the Electron gate is stationed the giant Campaneus who bears about
him the device of a naked man with a gleaming torch in his hands crying
out I will burn the city Against him will be pitted the doughty
Polyphontes favored by Diana and other gods

Against the gate of Neis the mighty Eteoclus is wheeling his foaming
steeds bearing a buckler blazoned with a man in armor treading the
steps of a ladder to his foemans tower Megareus the offspring of
Creon is the valiant warrior who will either pay the debt of his
nurture to his land or will decorate his fathers house with the spoils
of the conquered Eteoclus

The fiery Hippomedon is raging at the gate of Onca Minerva bearing upon
his buckler a Typhon darting forth smoke through his firebreathing
mouth eager to meet the brave Hyperbius son of OEnops who has been
selected to check his impetuous onslaught

At the gate of Boreas the youthful Parthenopus takes his stand a
fairfaced stripling upon whose face the youthful down is just making
its appearance Opposed to him stands Actor a man who is no braggart
but who will not submit to boastful tauntings or permit the rash
intruder to batter his way into the city

The mighty Amphiarus is waiting at the gate of Homolis and in the
meantime reproaches his ally Tydeus calling him a homicide and
Polynices he rebukes with having brought a mighty armament into his
native city Lasthenes he of the aged mind but youthful form is the
Thebian who has been chosen to marshal his forces against this invader

At the seventh gate stands Polynices brother of Eteocles bearing a
wellwrought shield with a device constructed upon it of a woman leading
on a mailed warrior bringing havoc to his paternal city and desirous of
becoming a fratricide Against him Eteocles will go and face him in
person and leader against leader brother against brother and foeman
against foeman take his stand

Eteocles then departs to engage in battle and soon after the messenger
enters to announce that six of the Theban warriors have been successful
but that Polynices and Eteocles have both fallen slain by each others
hand

Antigone and Ismene then enter each bewailing the death of their
brothers A herald interrupts them in the midst of their lamentations to
announce to them the decree of the senate which is that Eteocles on
account of his attachment to his country though a fratricide shall be
honored with fitting funeral rites but that Polynices the wouldbe
overturner of his native city shall be cast out unburied a prey to the
dogs

Against this decree Antigone rebels and with her final words announces
her unalterable intention of burying her brother in spite of the fate
which awaits her disobedience to the will of the senate




PROMETHEUS CHAINED

  Prometheus having by his attention to the wants of men
  provoked the anger of Jove is bound down in a cleft of a
  rock in a distant desert of Scythia Here he not only
  relates the wanderings but foretells the future lot of
  Io and likewise alludes to the fall of Joves dynasty
  Disdaining to explain his meaning to Mercury he is swept
  into the abyss amid terrific hurricane and earthquake

STRENGTH FORCE VULCAN PROMETHEUS

STRENGTH We are come to a plain the distant boundary of the earth
to the Scythian track to an untrodden desert Vulcan it behooves
thee that the mandates which thy Sire imposed be thy concernto bind
this daring wretch to the loftycragged rocks in fetters of
adamantine chains that can not be broken for he stole and gave to
mortals thy honor the brilliancy of fire that aids all arts Hence
for such a trespass he must needs give retribution to the gods that he
may be taught to submit to the sovereignty of Jupiter and to cease from
his philanthropic disposition

VULCAN Strength and Force as far as you are concerned the mandate of
Jupiter has now its consummation and there is no farther obstacle
But I have not the courage to bind perforce a kindred god to this
weatherbeaten ravine Yet in every way it is necessary for me to take
courage for this task for a dreadful thing it is to disregard the
directions of the Sire Loftyscheming son of rightcounseling
Themis unwilling shall I rivet thee unwilling in indissoluble shackles
to this solitary rock where nor voice nor form of any one of mortals
shalt thou see but slowly scorched by the bright blaze of the sun
thou shalt lose the bloom of thy complexion and to thee joyous shall
night in spangled robe veil the light and the sun again disperse the
hoarfrost of the morn and evermore shall the pain of the present evil
waste thee for no one yet born shall release thee Such fruits hast
thou reaped from thy friendly disposition to mankind For thou a god
not crouching beneath the wrath of the gods hast imparted to mortals
honors beyond what was right In requital whereof thou shalt keep
sentinel on this cheerless rock standing erect sleepless not bending
a knee and many laments and unavailing groans shalt thou utter for
the heart of Jupiter is hard to be entreated and every one that has
newlyacquired power is stern

ST Well well Why art thou delaying and vainly commiserating Why
loathest thou not the god that is most hateful to the gods who has
betrayed thy prerogative to mortals

VUL Relationship and intimacy are of great power

ST I grant itbut how is it possible to disobey the Sires word
Dreadest thou not this the rather

VUL Ay truly thou art ever pitiless and full of boldness

ST For to deplore this wretch is no cure for him But concern not
thou thyself vainly with matters that are of no advantage

VUL O much detested handicraft

ST Wherefore loathest thou it for with the ills now present thy craft
in good truth is not at all chargeable

VUL For all that I would that some other had obtained this

ST Every thing has been achieved except for the gods to rule for no
one is free save Jupiter

VUL I know itand I have nothing to say against it

ST Wilt thou not then bestir thyself to cast fetters about this wretch
that the Sire may not espy thee loitering

VUL Ay and in truth you may see the manacles ready

ST Take them and with mighty force clench them with the mallet about
his hands rivet him close to the crags

VUL This work of ours is speeding to its consummation and loiters not

ST Smite harder tighten slacken at no point for he hath cunning to
find outlets even from impracticable difficulties

VUL This arm at all events is fastened inextricably

ST And now clasp this securely that he may perceive himself to be a
duller contriver than Jupiter

VUL Save this sufferer no one could with reason find fault with me

ST Now by main force rivet the ruthless fang of an adamantine wedge
right through his breast

VUL Alas alas Prometheus I sigh over thy sufferings

ST Again thou art hanging back and sighest thou over the enemies of
Jupiter Look to it that thou hast not at some time to mourn for
thyself

VUL Thou beholdest a spectacle illsighted to the eye

ST I behold this wretch receiving his deserts But fling thou these
girths round his sides

VUL I must needs do this urge me not very much

ST Ay but I will urge thee and set thee on too Move downward and
strongly link his legs

VUL And in truth the task is done with no long toil

ST With main force now smite the galling fetters since stern indeed is
the inspector of this work

VUL Thy tongue sounds in accordance with thy form

ST Yield thou to softness but taunt not me with ruthlessness and
harshness of temper

VUL Let us go since he hath the shackles about his limbs

ST There now be insolent and after pillaging the prerogatives of the
gods confer them on creatures of a day In what will mortals be able to
alleviate these agonies of thine By no true title do the divinities
call thee Prometheus for thou thyself hast need of a Prometheus by
means of which you will slip out of this fate

  Exeunt STRENGTH and FORCE

PROMETHEUS O divine ther and ye swiftwinged breezes and ye
fountains of rivers and countless dimpling of the waves of the
deep and thou earth mother of alland to the allseeing orb of the
Sun I appeal look upon me what treatment I a god am enduring at the
hand of the gods Behold with what indignities mangled I shall have to
wrestle through time of years innumerable Such an ignominious bondage
hath the new ruler of the immortals devised against me Alas alas I
sigh over the present suffering and that which is coming on How where
must a termination of these toils arise And yet what is it I am saying
I know beforehand all futurity exactly and no suffering will come upon
me unlookedfor But I needs must bear my doom as easily as may be
knowing as I do that the might of Necessity can not be resisted

But yet it is not possible for me either to hold my peace or not to
hold my peace touching these my fortunes For having bestowed boons upon
mortals I am enthralled unhappy in these hardships And I am he that
searched out the source of fire by stealth borneoff inclosed in a
fennelrod which has shown itself a teacher of every art to
mortals and a great resource Such then as this is the vengeance that I
endure for my trespasses being riveted in fetters beneath the naked
sky

Hah what sound what ineffable odor hath been wafted to me
emanating from a god or from mortal or of some intermediate nature
Has there come anyone to the remote rock as a spectator of my
sufferings or with what intent Behold me an illfated god in
durance the foe of Jupiter him that hath incurred the detestation of
all the gods who frequent the court of Jupiter by reason of my
excessive friendliness to mortals Alas alas what can this hasty
motion of birds be which I again hear hard by me The air too is
whistling faintly with the whirrings of pinions Every thing that
approaches is to me an object of dread

CHORUS Dread thou nothing for this is a friendly band that has come
with the fleet rivalry of their pinions to this rock after prevailing
with difficulty on the mind of our father And the swiftlywafting
breezes escorted me for the echo of the clang of steel pierced to the
recess of our grots and banished my demurelooking reserve and I sped
without my sandals in my winged chariot

PR Alas alas ye offspring of prolific Thetys and daughters of Ocean
your sire who rolls around the whole earth in his unslumbering stream
look upon me see clasped in what bonds I shall keep an unenviable watch
on the topmost crags of this ravine

CH I see Prometheus and a fearful mist full of tears darts over mine
eyes as I looked on thy frame withering on the rocks in these
galling adamantine fetters for new pilots are the masters of Olympus
and Jove contrary to right lords it with new laws and things
aforetime had in reverence he is obliterating

PR Oh would that he had sent me beneath the earth and below into the
boundless Tartarus of Hades that receives the dead after savagely
securing me in indissoluble bonds so that no god at any time nor any
other being had exulted in this my doom Whereas now hapless one I
the sport of the winds suffer pangs that gladden my foes

CH Who of the gods is so hardhearted as that these things should be
grateful to him Who is there that sympathizes not with thy sufferings
Jove excepted He indeed in his wrath assuming an inflexible temper
is evermore oppressing the celestial race nor will he cease before that
either he shall have sated his heart or some one by some stratagem
shall have seized upon his sovereignity that will be no easy prize

PR In truth hereafter the president of the immortals shall have
need of me albeit that I am ignominiously suffering in stubborn
shackles to discover to him the new plot by which he is to be despoiled
of his sceptre and his honors But neither shall he win me by the
honeytongued charms of persuasion nor will I at any time crouching
beneath his stern threats divulge this matter before he shall have
released me from my cruel bonds and shall be willing to yield me
retribution for this outrage

CH Thou indeed both art bold and yieldest nought to thy bitter
calamities but art over free in thy language But piercing terror is
worrying my soul for I fear for thy fortunes How when will it be thy
destiny to make the haven and see the end of these thy sufferings for
the son of Saturn has manners that supplication cannot reach and an
inexorable heart

PR I know that Jupiter is harsh and keeps justice to himself but for
all that he shall hereafter be softened in purpose when he shall be
crushed in this way and after calming his unyielding temper with
eagerness will he hereafter come into league and friendship with me that
will eagerly welcome him

CH Unfold and speak out to us the whole story from what accusation has
Jupiter seized thee and is thus disgracefully and bitterly tormenting
thee Inform us if thou be in no respect hurt by the recital

PR Painful indeed are these things for me to tell and painful too for
me to hold my peace and in every way grievous As soon as the
divinities began discord and a feud was stirred up among them with one
anotherone party wishing to eject Saturn from his throne in
order forsooth that Jupiter might be king and others expediting the
reverse that Jupiter might at no time rule over the gods then I when
I gave the best advice was not able to prevail upon the Titans
children of Uranus and Terra but they contemning in their stout
spirits wily schemes fancied that without any trouble and by dint of
main force they were to win the sovereignty But it was not once only
that my mother Themis and Terra a single person with many titles had
forewarned me of the way in which the future would be accomplished how
it was destined that not by main force nor by the strong hand but by
craft the victors should prevail When however I explained such points
in discourse they deigned not to pay me any regard at all Of the plans
which then presented themselves to me the best appeared that I should
take my mother and promptly side with Jupiter who was right willing to
receive us And tis by means of my counsels that the murky abyss of
Tartarus overwhelms the antique Saturn allies and all After thus being
assisted by me the tyrant of the gods hath recompensed me with this
foul recompense For somehow this malady attaches to tyranny not to put
confidence in its friends But for your inquiries upon what charge is it
that he outrages me this I will make clear As soon as he has
established himself on his fathers throne he assigns forthwith to the
different divinities each his honors and he was marshaling in order his
empire but of woebegone mortals he made no account but wished after
having annihilated the entire race to plant another new one And these
schemes no one opposed except myself But I dared I ransomed mortals
from being utterly destroyed and going down to Hades Tis for this in
truth that I am bent by sufferings such as these agonizing to endure
and piteous to look upon I that had compassion for mortals have myself
been deemed unworthy to obtain this but mercilessly am thus coerced to
order a spectacle inglorious to Jupiter

CH Ironhearted and formed of rock too Prometheus is he who condoles
not with thy toils for I could have wished never to have beheld them
and now when I behold them I am pained in my heart

PR Ay in very deed I am a piteous object for friends to behold

CH And didst thou chance to advance even beyond this

PR Yes I prevented mortals from foreseeing their doom

CH By finding what remedy for this malady

PR I caused blind hopes to dwell within them

CH In this thou gavest a mighty benefit to mortals

PR Over and above these boons however I imparted fire to them

CH And do the creatures of a day now possess bright fire

PR Yesfrom which they will moreover learn thoroughly many arts

CH Is it indeed on charges such as these that Jupiter is both visiting
thee with indignities and in no wise grants thee a respite from thy
pains And is no period to thy toils set before thee

PR None other assuredly but when it may please him

CH And how shall it be his good pleasure What hope is there Seest
thou not that thou didst err but how thou didst err I can not relate
with pleasure and it would be a pain to you But let us leave these
points and search thou for some escape from thine agony

PR Tis easy for any one that hath his foot unentangled by sufferings
both to exhort and to admonish him that is in evil plight But I knew
all these things willingly willingly I erred I will not gainsay it
and in doing service to mortals I brought upon myself sufferings Yet
not at all did I imagine that in such a punishment as this I was to
wither away upon lofty rocks meeting with this desolate solitary crag
And yet wail ye not over my present sorrows but after alighting on the
ground list ye to the fortune that is coming on that ye may learn the
whole throughout Yield to me yield ye take ye a share in the woes of
him that is now suffering Hence in the same way doth calamity roaming
to and fro settle down on different individuals

CH Upon those who are nothing loth hast thou urged this Prometheus
and now having with light step quitted my rapidlywafted chariotseat
and the pure ther highway of the feathered race I will draw near to
this rugged ground and I long to hear the whole tale of thy sufferings

  Enter OCEAN

I am arrived at the end of a long journey having passed over it
to thee Prometheus guiding this winged steed of mine swift of pinion
by my will without a bit and rest assured I sorrow with thy
misfortunes For both the tie of kindred thus constrains me and
relationship apart there is no one on whom I would bestow a larger
share of my regard than to thyself And thou shalt know that these
words are sincere and that it is not in me vainly to do lipservice
for come signify to me in what it is necessary for me to assist thee
for at no time shalt thou say that thou hast a stancher friend than
Oceanus

PR Hah what means this and hast thou too come to be a witness of my
pangs How hast thou ventured after quitting both the stream that bears
thy name and the rockroofed selfwrought grots to come into the
iron teeming land Is it that you may contemplate my misfortunes and as
sympathizing with my woes that thou hast come Behold a spectacle me
here the friend of Jupiter that helped to establish his sovereignty
with what pains I am bent by him

OC I see Prometheus and to thee subtle as thou art I wish to give
the best counsel Know thyself and assume to thyself new manners for
among the gods too there is a new monarch But if thou wilt utter words
thus harsh and whetted Jupiter mayhap though seated far aloft will
hear thee so that the present bitterness of sufferings will seem to
thee to be childs play But O hapless one dismiss the passion which
thou feelest and search for a deliverance from these sufferings of
thine Oldfashioned maxims these it may be I appear to thee to utter
yet such becomes the wages of the tongue that talks too proudly But not
even yet art thou humble nor submittest to ills and in addition to
those that already beset thee thou art willing to bring others upon
thee Yet not if at least thou takest me for thy instructor wilt thou
stretch out thy leg against the pricks as thou seest that a harsh
monarch and one that is not subject to control is lording it And now
I for my part will go and will essay if I be able to disinthrall thee
from these thy pangs But be thou still nor be over impetuous in thy
language What knowest thou not exactly extremely intelligent as thou
art that punishment is inflicted on a froward tongue

PR I give thee joy because that thou hast escaped censure after
taking part in and venturing along with me in all things And now leave
him alone and let it not concern thee For in no wise wilt thou
persuade him for he is not open to persuasion And look thou well to it
that thou take not harm thyself by the journey

OC Thou art far better calculated by nature to instruct thy neighbors
than thyself I draw my conclusion from fact and not from word But
think not for a moment to divert me from the attempt For I am
confident yea I am confident that Jupiter will grant me this boon so
as to release thee from these pangs of thine

PR In part I commend thee and will by no means at any time cease to do
so For in zeal to serve me thou lackest nothing But trouble thyself
not for in vain without being of any service to me wilt thou
labor if in any respect thou art willing to labor But hold thou thy
peace and keep thyself out of harms way for I though I be in
misfortune would not on this account be willing that sufferings should
befall as many as possible No indeed since also the disasters of my
brother Atlas gall my heart who is stationed in the western regions
sustaining on his shoulders the pillar of heaven and of earth a burden
not of easy grasp I commiserated too when I beheld the earthborn
inmate of the Cilician caverns a tremendous prodigy the hundredheaded
impetuous Typhon overpowered by force who withstood all the gods
hissing slaughter from his hungry jaws and from his eyes there flashed
a hideous glare as though he would perforce overthrow the sovereignty
of Jove But the sleepless shaft of Jupiter came upon him the
descending thunderbolt breathing forth flame which scared him out of
his presumptuous bravadoes for having been smitten to his very soul he
was crumbled to a cinder and thunderblasted in his prowess And now a
helpless and paralyzed form is he lying hard by a narrow frith pressed
down beneath the roots of tna And seated on the topmost peaks
Vulcan forges the molten masses whence there shall one day burst forth
floods devouring with fell jaws the level fields of fruitful Sicily
with rage such as this shall Typhon boil over in hot artillery of a
neverglutted firebreathing storm albeit he hath been reduced to ashes
by the thunderbolt of Jupiter But thou art no novice nor needest thou
me for thine instructor Save thyself as best thou knowest how but I
will exhaust my present fate until such time as the spirit of Jupiter
shall abate its wrath

OC Knowest thou not this then Prometheus that words are the
physicians of a distempered feeling

PR True if one seasonably soften down the heart and do not with rude
violence reduce a swelling spirit

OC Ay but in foresight along with boldness what mischief is there
that thou seest to be inherent inform me

PR Superfluous trouble and trifling folly

OC Suffer me to sicken in this said sickness since tis of the highest
advantage for one that is wise not to seem to be wise

PR Not so for this trespass will seem to be mine

OC Thy language is plainly sending me back to my home

PR Lest thy lamentation over me bring thee into illwill

OC What with him who hath lately seated himself on the throne that
ruleth over all

PR Beware of him lest at any time his heart be moved to wrath

OC Thy disaster Prometheus is my monitor

PR Away withdraw thee keep thy present determination

OC On me hastening to start hast thou urged this injunction for my
winged quadruped flaps with his pinions the smooth track of ther and
blithely would he recline his limbs in his stalls at home

  Exit OC

CH I bewail thee for thy lost fate Prometheus A flood of trickling
tears from my yielding eyes has bedewed my cheek with its humid
gushings for Jupiter commanding this thine unenviable doom by laws of
his own displays his spear appearing superior oer the gods of old
And now the whole land echoes with wailingthey wail thy stately and
timegraced honors and those of thy brethren and all they of mortal
race that occupy a dwelling neighboring on hallowed Asia mourn with
thy deeplydeplorable sufferings the virgins that dwell in the land of
Colchis too fearless of the fight and the Scythian horde who possess
the most remote regions of earth around lake Motis and the warlike
flower of Arabia who occupy a fortress on the craggy heights in
the neighborhood of Caucasus a warriorhost clamoring amid
sharplybarbed spears

One other god only indeed have I heretofore beheld in miseries the
Titan Atlas subdued by the galling of adamantine bonds who
evermore in his back is groaning beneath the excessive mighty mass
of the pole of heaven And the billow of the deep roars as it falls in
cadence the depth moans and the murky vault of Hades rumbles beneath
the earth and the fountains of the pure streaming rivers wail for his
piteous pains

PR Do not I pray you suppose that I am holding my peace from pride or
selfwill but by reflection am I gnawed to the heart seeing myself
thus ignominiously entreated And yet who but myself defined
completely the prerogative for these same new gods But on these matters
I say nothing for I should speak to you already acquainted with these
things But for the misfortunes that existed among mortals hear how I
made them that aforetime lived as infants rational and possessed of
intellect And I will tell you having no complaint against
mankind as detailing the kindness of the boons which I bestowed upon
them they who at first seeing saw in vain hearing they heard not But
like to the forms of dreams for a long time they used to huddle
together all things at random and naught knew they about
brickbuilt and sunward houses nor carpentry but they dwelt in
the excavated earth like tiny emmets in the sunless depths of caverns
And they had no sure sign either of winter or of flowery spring or of
fruitful summer but they used to do every thing without judgment until
indeed I showed to them the risings of the stars and their settings
hard to be discerned

And verily I discover for them Numbers the surpassing all
inventions the combinations too of letters and Memory effective
mothernurse of all arts I also first bound with yokes beasts
submissive to the collars and in order that with their bodies they
might become to mortals substitutes for their severest toils I brought
steeds under cars obedient to the rein a glory to pompous luxury
And none other than I invented the canvaswinged chariots of mariners
that roam over the ocean After discovering for mortals such inventions
wretch that I am I myself have no device whereby I may escape from my
present misery

CH Thou hast suffered unseemly ills baulked in thy discretion thou art
erring and like a bad physician having fallen into a distemper thou
art fainthearted and in reference to thyself thou canst not discover
by what manner of medicines thou mayest be cured

PR When thou hearest the rest of my tale thou wilt wonder still more
what arts and resources I contrived For the greatestif that any one
fell into a distemper there was no remedy neither in the way of diet
nor of liniment nor of potion but for lack of medicines they used to
pine away to skeletons before that I pointed out to them the
composition of mild remedies wherewith they ward off all their
maladies Many modes too of the divining art did I classify and was the
first that discriminated among dreams those which are destined to be a
true vision obscure vocal omens too I made known to them tokens
also incidental on the road and the flight of birds of crooked talons I
clearly defined both those that are in their nature auspicious and the
illomened and what the kind of life that each leads and what are
their feuds and endearments and intercourse one with another the
smoothness too of the entrails and what hue they must have to be
acceptable to the gods the various happy formations of the gall and
liver and the limbs enveloped in fat and having roasted the long chine
I pointed out to mortals the way into an abstruse art and I brought to
light the fiery symbols that were aforetime wrapt in darkness Such
indeed were these boons and the gains to mankind that were hidden under
ground brass iron silver and goldwho could assert that he had
discovered before me No one I well know who does not mean to idly
babble And in one brief sentence learn the whole at onceAll arts
among the human race are from Prometheus

CH Do not now serve the human race beyond what is profitable nor
disregard thyself in thy distress since I have good hopes that thou
shalt yet be liberated from these shackles and be not one whit less
powerful than Jove

PR Not at all in this way is Fate that brings events to their
consummation ordained to accomplish these things but after having been
bent by countless sufferings and calamities thus am I to escape from my
shackles And art is far less powerful than necessity

CH Who then is the pilot of necessity

PR The triform Fates and the remembering Furies

CH Is Jupiter then less powerful than these

PR Most certainly he can not at any rate escape his doom

CH Why what is doomed for Jupiter but to reign for evermore

PR This thou mayest not yet learn and do not press it

CH Tis surely some solemn mystery that thou veilest

PR Make mention of some other matter it is by no means seasonable to
proclaim this but it must be shrouded in deepest concealment for it is
by keeping this secret that I am to escape from my ignominious shackles
and miseries

CH Never may Jupiter who directs all things set his might in
opposition to my purpose nor may I be backward in attending upon the
gods at their hallowed banquets at which oxen are sacrificed beside
the restless stream of my sire Ocean and may I not trespass in my
words but may this feeling abide by me and never melt away Sweet it is
to pass through a long life in confident hopes making the spirits swell
with bright merriment but I shudder as I behold thee harrowed by
agonies incalculable For not standing in awe of Jupiter thou
Prometheus in thy selfwill honorest mortals to excess Come my
friend own how boonless was the boon say where is any aid What relief
can come from the creatures of a day Sawest thou not the powerless
weakness nought better than a dream in which the blind race of men is
entangled Never shall at any time the schemes of mortals evade the
harmonious system of Jupiter This I learned by witnessing thy
destructive fate Prometheus And far different is this strain that now
flits toward me from the hymenal chant which I raised around the baths
and thy couch with the consent of nuptials when after having won
Hesione with thy lovetokens thou didst conduct her our sister to be
thy bride the sharer of thy bed

  Enter IO

What land is this what race whom shall I say I here behold
stormtossed in rocky fetters Of what trespass is the retribution
destroying thee Declare to me into what part of earth I forlorn have
roamed Ah me alas alas again the hornet stings me miserable O
earth avert the goblin of earthborn Argus I am terrified at
the sight of the neatherd of thousand eyes for he is journeying on
keeping a cunning glance whom not even after death does earth conceal
but issuing forth from among the departed he chases me miserable and he
makes me to wander famished along the shingled strand while the
sounding waxcompacted pipe drones on a sleepy strain Oh oh ye
powers Oh powers whither do my farroaming wanderings convey me In
what in what O son of Saturn hast thou having found me
transgressing shackled me in these pangs Ah ah and art thus wearing
out a timorous wretch frenzied with stingdriven fear Burn me with
fire or bury me in earth or give me for food to the monsters of the
deep and grudge me not these prayers O king Amply have my
muchtraversed wanderings harassed me nor can I discover how I may
avoid pain Hearest thou the address of the oxhorned maiden

PR How can I fail to hear the damsel that is frenzydriven by the
hornet the daughter of Inachus who warms the heart of Jupiter with
love and now abhorred of Juno is driven perforce courses of exceeding
length

IO From whence utterest thou the name of my father Tell me the
woebegone who thou art who I say O hapless one that hast thus
correctly accosted me miserable and hast named the heaveninflicted
disorder which wastes me fretting with its maddening stings Ah ah
violently driven by the famishing tortures of my boundings have I come a
victim to the wrathful counsels of Juno And of the illfated who are
there ah me that endure woes such as mine But do thou clearly define
to me what remains for me to suffer what salve what remedy there
is for my malady discover to me if at all thou knowest speak tell it
to the wretched roaming damsel

PR I will tell thee clearly every thing which thou desirest to learn
not interweaving riddles but in plain language as it is right to open
the mouth to friends Thou seest him that bestowed fire on mortals
Prometheus

IO O thou that didst dawn a common benefit upon mortals wretched
Prometheus as penance for what offense art thou thus suffering

PR I have just ceased lamenting my own pangs

IO Wilt thou not then accord to me this boon

PR Say what it is that thou art asking for thou mightest learn
everything from me

IO Say who it was that bound thee fast in this cleft

PR The decree of Jupiter but the hand of Vulcan

IO And for what offenses art thou paying the penalty

PR Thus much alone is all that I can clearly explain to thee

IO At least in addition to this discover what time shall be to me
woeworn the limit of my wanderings

PR Not to learn this is better for thee than to learn it

IO Yet conceal not from me what I am to endure

PR Nay I grudge thee not this gift

IO Why then delayest thou to utter the whole

PR Tis not reluctance but I am loth to shock thy feelings

IO Do not be more anxious on my account than is agreeable to me

PR Since thou art eager I must needs tell thee attend thou

CH Not yet however but grant me also a share of the pleasure Let us
first learn the malady of this maiden from her own tale of her
destructive fortunes but for the sequel of her afflictions let her
be informed by thee

PR It is thy part Io to minister to the gratification of these now
before thee both for all other reasons and that they are the sisters
of thy father Since to weep and lament over misfortunes when one is
sure to win a tear from the listeners is well worth the while

IO I know not how I should disobey you and in a plain tale ye shall
learn everything that ye desire and yet I am pained even to speak of
the tempest that hath been sent upon me from heaven and the utter
marring of my person whence it suddenly came upon me a wretched
creature For nightly visions thronging to my maiden chamber would
entice me with smooth words O damsel greatly fortunate why dost
thou live long time in maidenhood when it is in thy power to achieve a
match the very noblest for Jupiter is fired by thy charms with the
shaft of passion and longs with thee to share in love But do not my
child spurn away from thee the couch of Jupiter but go forth to
Lernas fertile mead to the folds and oxstalls of thy father that the
eye of Jove may have respite from its longing By dreams such as these
was I unhappy beset every night until at length I made bold to tell my
sire of the dreams that haunted me by night And he dispatched both to
Pytho and Dodona many a messenger to consult the oracles that he
might learn what it behooved him to do or say so as to perform what was
wellpleasing to the divinities And they came bringing a report back of
oracles ambiguously worded indistinct and obscurely delivered But at
last a clear response came to Inachus plainly charging and directing
him to thrust me forth both from my home and my country to stray an
outcast to earths remotest limits and that if he would not a
fieryvisaged thunderbolt would come from Jupiter and utterly blot out
his whole race Overcome by oracles of Loxias such as these unwilling
did me expel and exclude me unwilling from his dwelling but the bit of
Jupiter perforce constrained him to do this And straightway my
person and my mind were distorted and horned as ye see stung by the
keenlybiting fly I rushed with maniac boundings to the sweet stream of
Cerchneia and the fountain of Lerna and the earthborn neatherd
Argus of untempered fierceness kept dogging me peering after my
footsteps with thickset eyes Him however an unlookedfor sudden fate
bereaved of life but I hornetstricken am driven by the scourge divine
from land to land Thou hearest what has taken place and if thou art
able to say what pangs there remain for me declare them and do not
compassionating me warm me with false tales for I pronounce fabricated
statements to be a most foul malady

CH Ah ah forbear Alas Never never did I expect that a tale so
strange would come to my ears or that sufferings thus horrible to
witness and horrible to endure outrages terrors with their twoedged
goad would chill my spirit Alas alas O Fate Fate I shudder as I
behold the condition of Io

PR Prematurely however are thou sighing and art full of terror
Hold until thou shalt also have heard the residue

CH Say on inform me fully to the sick indeed it is sweet to get a
clear knowledge beforehand of the sequel of their sorrows

PR Your former desire at any rate ye gained from me easily for first
of all ye desired to be informed by her recital of the affliction
that attaches to herself Now give ear to the rest what sort of
sufferings it is the fate of this young damsel before you to undergo at
the hand of Juno thou too seed of Inachus lay to heart my words that
thou mayest be fully informed of the termination of thy journey In the
first place after turning thyself from this spot toward the rising of
the sun traverse unplowed fields and thou wilt reach the wandering
Scythians who raised from off the around inhabit wicker dwellings on
wellwheeled cars equipped with distantshooting bows to whom thou
must not draw near but pass on out of their land bringing thy feet to
approach the rugged roaring shores And on thy left hand dwell the
Chalybes workers of iron of whom thou must needs beware for they are
barbarous and not accessible to strangers And thou wilt come to the
river Hybristes not falsely so called which do not thou cross for
it is not easy to ford until thou shalt have come to Caucasus itself
loftiest of mountains where from its very brow the river spouts forth
its might And surmounting its peaks that neighbor on the stars thou
must go into a southward track where thou wilt come to the
mandetesting host of Amazons who hereafter shall make a settlement
Themiscyra on the banks of Thermodon where lies the rugged
Salmydessian seagorge a host by mariners hated a stepdame to ships
and they will conduct thee on thy way and that right willingly Thou
shalt come too to the Cimmerian isthmus hard by the very portals of a
lake with narrow passage which thou undauntedly must leave and cross
the Motic frith and there shall exist for evermore among mortals a
famous legend concerning thy passage and after thy name it shall be
called the Bosphorus and after having quitted European ground thou
shalt come to the Asiatic continent Does not then the sovereign of the
gods seem to you to be violent alike toward all things for he a god
lusting to enjoy the charms of this mortal fair one hath cast upon her
these wanderings And a bitter wooer maiden hast thou found for thy
hand for think that the words which thou hast now heard are not even
for a prelude

IO Woe is me ah ah

PR Thou too in thy turn art crying out and moaning what wilt thou
do then when thou learnest the residue of thy ills

CH What hast thou aught of suffering left to tell to her

PR Ay a tempestuous sea of baleful calamities

IO What gain then is it for me to live but why did I not quickly fling
myself from this rough precipice that dashing on the plain I had rid
myself of all my pangs for better is it once to die than all ones
days to suffer ill

PR Verily thou wouldst hardly bear the agonies of me to whom it is not
doomed to die For this would be an escape from sufferings But now
there is no limit set to my hardships until Jove shall have been
deposed from his tyranny

IO What is it possible that Jupiter should ever fall from his power

PR Glad wouldst thou be I ween to witness this event

IO And how not so I who through Jupiter am suffering ill

PR Well then thou mayest assure thyself of these things that they are
so

IO By whom is he to be despoiled of his sceptre of tyranny

PR Himself by his own senseless counsels

IO In what manner Specify it if there be no harm

PR He will make such a match as he shall one day rue

IO Celestial or mortal If it may be spoken tell me

PR But why ask its nature for it is not a matter that I can
communicate to you

IO Is it by a consort that he is to be ejected from his throne

PR Yes surely one that shall give birth to a son mightier than the
father

IO And has he no refuge from this misfortune

PR Not he indeed before at any rate I after being liberated from my
shackles

IO Who then is he that shall liberate thee in despite of Jupiter

PR It is ordained that it shall be one of thine own descendants

IO How sayest thou Shall child of mine release thee from thy ills

PR Yes the third of thy lineage in addition to ten other
generations

IO This prophecy of thine is no longer easy for me to form a guess
upon

PR Nor seek thou to know over well thine own pangs

IO Do not after proffering me a benefit withhold it from me

PR I will freely grant thee one of two disclosures

IO Explain to me first of what sort they are and allow me my choice

PR I allow it thee for choose whether I shall clearly tell to thee the
residue of thy troubles or who it is that is to be my deliverer

CH Of these twain do thou vouchsafe to bestow the one boon on this
damsel and the other on me and disdain thou not my request To her
tell the rest of her wanderings and to me him that is to deliver thee
for this I long to hear

PR Seeing that ye are eagerly bent upon it I will not oppose your
wishes so as not to utter every thing as much as ye desire To thee in
the first place Io will I describe thy mazy wanderings which do thou
engrave on the recording tablets of thy mind

When thou shalt have crossed the stream that is the boundary of the
Continents to the ruddy realms of morn where walks the sun 
having passed over the roaring swell of the sea until thou shalt reach
the Gorgonian plains of Cisthene where dwell the Phorcides three
swanlike aged damsels that possess one eye in common that have but a
single tooth on whom neer doth the sun glance with his rays nor the
nightly moon And hard by are three winged sisters of these the
snaketressed Gorgons abhorred of mortals whom none of human race can
look upon and retain the breath of life Such is this caution
which I mention to thee Now lend an ear to another hideous spectacle
for be on thy guard against the keenfanged hounds of Jupiter that never
bark the gryphons and the cavalry host of oneeyed Arimaspians who
dwell on the banks of the goldgushing fount the stream of Pluto go
not thou nigh to these And thou wilt reach a fardistant land a dark
tribe who dwell close upon the fountains of the sun where is the river
thiops Along the banks of this wend thy way until thou shalt have
reached the cataract where from the Bybline mountains the Nile pours
forth his hallowed grateful stream This will guide thee to the
triangular land of the Nile where at length Io it is ordained for
thee and thy children after thee to found the distant colony And if
aught of this is obscurely uttered and hard to be understood question
me anew and learn it thoroughly and clearly as for leisure I have
more than I desire

CH If indeed thou hast aught to tell of her baleful wanderings that
still remains or hath been omitted say on but if thou hast told the
whole give to us in our turn the favor which we ask and you
perchance remember

PR She hath heard the full term of her journeying And that she may
know that she hath not been listening to me in vain I will relate what
hardships she endured before she came hither giving her this as a sure
proof of my statements The very great multitude indeed of words I
shall omit and I will proceed to the termination itself of thine
aberrations For after that thou hadst come to the Molossian plains and
about the lofty ridge of Dodona where is the oracular seat of
Thesprotian Jove and a portent passing belief the speaking oaks by
which thou wast clearly and without any ambiguity saluted illustrious
spouse of Jove that art to be if aught of this hath any charms for
thee Thence madly rushing along the seaside track thou didst dart
away to the vast bay of Rhea from which thou art tempestdriven in
retrograde courses and in time to come know well that the gulf of the
deep shall be called IOnian a memorial of thy passage to all mortals
These hast thou as tokens of my intelligence how that it perceives
somewhat beyond what appears

The rest I shall tell both to you and to her in common after reaching
the very identical track of my former narrative There is on the lands
utmost verge a city Canopus hard by the Niles very mouth and alluvial
dike on this spot Jupiter at length makes thee sane by merely soothing
and touching thee with his unalarming hand And named after the
progeniture of Jupiter thou shalt give birth to swarthy Epaphus who
shall reap the harvest of all the land which the widestreaming Nile
waters But fifth in descent from him a generation of fifty virgins
shall again come to Argos not of their own accord fleeing from
incestuous wedlock with their cousins and these with fluttering hearts
like falcons left not far behind by doves shall come pursuing marriage
such as should not be pursued but heaven shall be jealous over their
persons and Pelasgia shall receive them after being crushed by a
deed of nightfenced daring wrought by womans hand for each bride
shall bereave her respective husband of life having dyed in their
throats a sword of twin sharp edge Would that in guise like this
Venus might visit my foes But tenderness shall soften one of the
maidens so that she shall not slay the partner of her couch but shall
be blunt in her resolve and of the two alternatives she shall choose
the former to be called a coward rather than a murderess She in Argos
shall give birth to a race of kings There needs a long discourse to
detail these things distinctly but from this seed be sure shall spring
a dauntless warrior renowned in archery who shall set me free from
these toils Such predictions did my aged mother the Titaness Themis
rehearse to me but how and whento tell this requires a long detail
and thou in knowing it all wouldst be in nought a gainer

IO Eleleu Eleleu Once more the spasm and maddening frenzies
inflame meand the sting of the hornet wrought by no fire
envenoms me and with panic my heart throbs violently against my breast
My eyes too are rolling in a mazy whirl and I am carried out of my
course by the raging blast of madness having no control of tongue but
my troubled words dash idly against the surges of loathsome calamity

  Exit IO

CH Wise was the man ay wise indeed who first weighed well this
maxim and with his tongue published it abroad that to match in ones
own degree is best by far and that one who lives by labor should
woo the hand neither of any that have waxed wanton in opulence nor of
such as pride themselves on nobility of birth Never O Destines
never  may ye behold me approaching as a partner the couch of
Jupiter nor may I be brought to the arms of any bridegroom from
among the sons of heaven for I am in dread when I behold the maiden Io
contented with no mortal lover greatly marred by wearisome wanderings
at the hand of Juno For myself indeedinasmuch as wedlock on ones
own level is free from apprehensionI feel no alarm And oh never
may the love of the mightier gods cast on me a glance that none can
elude This at least is a war without a conflict accomplishing things
impossible nor know I what might become of me for I see not how I
could evade the counsel of Jove

PR Yet truly shall Jove albeit he is selfwilled in his temper be
lowly in such wedlock is he prepared to wed as shall hurl him out
of his sovereignty and off his throne a forgotten thing and the curse
of his father Saturn shall then at length find entire consummation
which he imprecated when he was deposed from his ancient throne From
disasters such as these there is no one of the gods besides myself that
can clearly disclose to him a way of escape I know this and by what
means Wherefore let him rest on in his presumption putting confidence
in his thunders aloft brandishing in his hand a firebreathing bolt
For not one jot shall these suffice to save him from falling dishonored
in a downfall beyond endurance such an antagonist is he now with his
own hands preparing against himself a portent that shall baffle all
resistance who shall invent a flame more potent than the lightning and
a mighty din that shall surpass the thunder and shall shiver the ocean
trident that earthconvulsing pest the spear of Neptune And when he
hath stumbled upon this mischief he shall be taught how great is the
difference between sovereignty and slavery

CH Thou forsooth art boding against Jupiter the things thou wishest

PR Things that shall come to pass and that I desire to boot

CH And are we to expect that any one will get the mastery of Jove

PR Ay and pangs too yet harder to bear than these of mine shall he
sustain

CH And how is it that thou art not dismayed blurting out words such as
these

PR Why at what should I be terrified to whom it is not destined to die

CH Yet perchance he will provide for thee affliction more grievous than
even this

PR Let him do it then all is foreseen by me

CH They that do homage to Adrasteia are wise

PR Do homage make thy prayer cringe to each ruler of the day I care
for Jove less than nothing let him do let him lord it for this brief
span een as he list for not long shall he rule over the gods But no
more for I descry Joves courier close at hand the menial of the new
monarch beyond all doubt he has come to announce to us some news

  Enter MERCURY

Thee the contriver thee full of gall and bitterness who sinned
against the gods by bestowing their honors on creatures of a day the
thief of fire I address The Sire commands thee to divulge of what
nuptials it is that thou art vaunting by means of which he is to be put
down from his power And these things moreover without any kind of
mystery but each exactly as it is do thou tell out and entail not
upon me Prometheus a double journey and thou perceivest that by such
conduct Jove is not softened

PR High sounding ifaith and full of haughtiness is thy speech as
beseems a lackey of the gods Young in years ye are young in power
and ye fancy forsooth that ye dwell in a citadel impregnable against
sorrow Have I not known two monarchs dethroned from it And the
third that now is ruler I shall also see expelled most foully and most
quickly Seem I to thee in aught to be dismayed at and to crouch
beneath the new gods Widely ay altogether do I come short of such
feelings But do thou hie thee back the way by which thou camest for
not one tittle shalt thou learn of the matter on which thou questionest
me

MER Yet truly twas by such selfwill even before now that thou didst
bring thyself to such a calamitous mooring

PR Be well assured that I would not barter my wretched plight for thy
drudgery for better do I deem it to be a lackey to this rock than to
be born the confidential courier of father Jove Thus is it meet to
repay insult in kind

MER Thou seemest to revel in thy present state

PR Revel Would that I might see my foes thus reveling and among these
I reckon thee

MER What dost thou impute to me also any blame for thy mischances

PR In plain truth I detest all the gods as many of them as after
having received benefits at my hands are iniquitously visiting me with
evils

MER I hear thee raving with no slight disorder

PR Disordered I would be if disorder it be to loathe ones foes

MER Thou wouldst be beyond endurance wert thou in prosperity

PR Woes me

MER This word of thine Jove knows not

PR Ay but Time as he grows old teaches all things

MER And yet verily thou knowest not yet how to be discreet

PR No ifaith or I should not have held parley with thee menial as
thou art

MER Thou seemest disposed to tell nought of the things which the Sire
desires

PR In sooth being under obligation as I am to him I am bound to
return his favor

MER Thou floutest me forsooth as if I were a boy

PR Why art thou not a boy and yet sillier than one if thou lookest
to obtain any information from me There is no outrage nor artifice by
which Jupiter shall bring me to utter this before my torturing shackles
shall have been loosened Wherefore let his glowing lightning be hurled
and with the white feathered shower of snow and thunderings beneath the
earth let him confound and embroil the universe for nought of these
things shall bend me so much as even to say by whom it is doomed that he
shall be put down from his sovereignty

MER Consider now whether this determination seems availing

PR Long since has this been considered and resolved

MER Resolve O vain one resolve at length in consideration of thy
present sufferings to come to thy right senses

PR Thou troublest me with thine admonitions as vainly as
thou mightest a billow Never let it enter your thoughts that I
affrighted by the purpose of Jupiter shall become womanish and shall
importune the object whom I greatly loathe with effeminate upliftings
of my hands to release me from these shackles I want much of that

MER With all that I have said I seem to be speaking to no purpose for
not one whit art thou melted or softened in thy heart by entreaties but
art champing the bit like a colt fresh yoked and struggling against the
reins But on the strength of an impotent scheme art thou thus violent
for obstinacy in one not soundly wise itself by itself availeth less
than nothing And mark if thou art not persuaded by my words what a
tempest and threefold surge of ills from which there is no escape
will come upon thee For in the first place the Sire will shiver this
craggy cleft with thunder and the blaze of his bolt and will overwhelm
thy body and a clasping arm of rock shall bear thee up And after thou
shalt have passed through to its close a long space of time thou shalt
come back into the light and a winged hound of Jupiter a
bloodthirsting eagle shall ravenously mangle thy huge lacerated frame
stealing upon thee an unbidden guest and tarrying all the livelong
day and shall banquet his fill on the black viands of thy liver To
such labors look thou for no termination until some god shall appear
as a substitute in thy pangs and shall be willing to go both to gloomy
Hades and to the murky depths around Tartarus Wherefore advise thee
since this is no fictitious vaunt but uttered in great earnestness for
the divine mouth knows not how to utter falsehood but will bring every
word to pass But do thou look around and reflect and never for a
moment deem pertinacity better than discretion

CH To us indeed Mercury seems to propose no unseasonable counsel for
he bids thee to abandon thy recklessness and seek out wise
consideration Be persuaded for to a wise man tis disgraceful to err

PR To me already well aware of it hath this fellow urged his message
but for a foe to suffer horribly at the hands of foes is no indignity
Wherefore let the doublypointed wreath of his fire be hurled at me and
ether be torn piecemeal by thunder and spasm of savage blasts and let
the wind rock earth from her base roots and all and with stormy surge
mingle in rough tide the billow of the deep and the paths of the stars
and fling my body into black Tartarus with a whirl in the stern eddies
of necessity Yet by no possible means shall he visit me with death

MER Resolutions and expressions in truth such as these of thine one
may hear from maniacs For in what point doth his fate fall short of
insanity What doth it abate from ravings But do ye then at any
rate that sympathize with him in his sufferings withdraw hence
speedily somewhither from this spot lest the harsh bellowing of the
thunder smite you with idiotcy

CH Utter and advise me to something else in which too thou mayest
prevail upon me for in this be sure thou hast intruded a proposal
not to be borne How is it that thou urgest me to practice baseness
Along with him here I am willing to endure what is destined for I have
learned to abhor traitors and there is no evil which I hold in greater
abomination

MER Well then bear in mind the things of which I forewarn you and do
not when ye have been caught in the snares of At throw the blame on
fortune nor ever at any time say that Jove cast you into unforeseen
calamity no indeed but ye your ownselves for well aware and not on a
sudden nor in ignorance will ye be entangled by your senselessness in
an impervious net of At

  Exit MERCURY

PR And verily in deed and no longer in word doth the earth heave and
the roaring echo of thunder rolls bellowing by us and deep blazing
wreaths of lightning are glaring and hurricanes whirl the dust and
blasts of all the winds are leaping forth showing one against the other
a strife of conflict gusts and the firmament is embroiled with the
deep Such is this onslaught that is clearly coming upon me from
Jove a cause for terror O dread majesty of my mother Earth O ether
that diffusest thy common light thou beholdest the wrongs I suffer




THE SEVEN AGAINST THEBES


The siege of the city of Thebes and the description of the seven
champions of the Theban and Argive armies The deaths of the brothers
Polynices and Eteocles the mournings over them by their sisters
Antigone and Ismene and the public refusal of burial to the ashes of
Polynices against which Antigone boldly protests conclude the play

SCENE The Acropolis of ThebesCompare v  ed Blomf

TIME Early in the morning the length of the action can scarcely be
fixed with absolute certainty It certainly did not exceed twelve hours

The expedition of the Seven against Thebes is fixed by Sir I Newton
BC  Cf of his Chronology p  Blair carries it as far back as
BC OLD TRANSLATOR

ETEOCLES Citizens of Cadmus it is fitting that he should speak things
seasonable who has the care of affairs on the poop of a state managing
the helm not lulling his eyelids in slumber For if we succeed the
gods are the cause but if on the other hand which heaven forbid
mischance should befall Eteocles alone would be much bruited through
the city by the townsmen in strains clamorous and in wailings of which
may Jove prove rightly called the Averter to the city of the
Cadmans And now it behooves youboth him who still falls short of
youth in its prime and him who in point of age has passed his youth
nurturing the ample vigor of his frame and each that is in his
prime as is best fittingto succor the city and the altars of
your countrys gods so that their honors may never be obliterated your
children too and your motherland most beloved nurse for she taking
fully on herself the whole trouble of your rearing nurtured you when
infants crawling on her kindly soil for her trusty shieldbearing
citizens that ye might be trusty for this service And for the
present indeed up to this day the deity inclines in our favor since
to us now all this time beleaguered the war for the most part by divine
allotment turns out well But now as saith the seer the feeder of
birds revolving in ear and thoughts without the use of fire the
oracular birds with unerring arthe lord of such divining powers
declares that the main Achan assault is this night proclaimed and
that the Achans attempt the city

But haste ye all both to the battlements and the gates of the tower
works On in full panoply throng the breastworks and take your
stations on the platforms of the towers and making stand at the
outlets of the gates be of good heart nor be overdismayed at the
rabble of the aliens God will give a happy issue Moreover I have also
dispatched scouts and observers of the army who will not I feel
assured loiter on their way and when I have had intelligence from
these I shall in no point be surprised by stratagem

MESSENGERMost gallant Eteocles sovereign of the Cadmans I have
come bearing a clear account of the matters yonder from the army and I
myself am eyewitness of the facts For seven chieftains impetuous
leaders of battalions cutting a bulls throat over an ironrimmed
shield and touching with their hands the gore of the bull by oath
have called to witness Mars Enyo and Terror that delights in
bloodshed that either having wrought the demolition of our city they
will make havoc of the town of the Cadmans or having fallen will steep
this land of ours in gore Memorials too of themselves to their parents
at home were they with their hands hanging in festoons at the car
of Adrastus dropping a tear but no sound of complaint passed their
lips For their ironhearted spirit glowing with valor was panting
as of lions that glare battle And the report of these my tidings is not
retarded by sluggishness But I left them in the very act of casting
lots that so each of them obtaining his post by lot might lead on his
battalion to our gates Wherefore do thou with all speed marshal at the
outlets of the gates the bravest men the chosen of our city for
already the host of Argives hard at hand armed cappi is in motion
is speeding onward and white foam is staining the plain with its
drippings from the lungs of their chargers Do thou then like the
clever helmsman of a vessel fence our city before the breath of
Mars burst like a hurricane upon it for the mainland billow of their
host is roaring And for these measures do thou seize the very earliest
opportunity for the sequel I will keep my eye a faithful watch by day
and thou knowing from the clearness of my detail the movements of those
without shalt be unscathed

  Exit MESSENGER

ET O Jupiter and earth and ye tutelary deities and thou Curse the
mighty Erinnys of my sire do not I pray uproot with utter destruction
from its very base a prey to foemen our city which utters the
language of Greece and our native dwellings Grant that they may
never hold the free land and city of Cadmus in a yoke of slavery but be

CHORUS I wail over our fearful mighty woes the army is let loose
having quitted its camp a mighty mounted host is streaming hitherward
in advance the dust appearing high in the air convinces me a
voiceless clear true messenger the noise of the clatter of their
hoofs upon the plain reaching even to our couches approaches my
ears is wafted on and is rumbling like a resistless torrent lashing
the mountainside Alas alas oh gods and goddesses avert the rising
horror the whitebucklered wellappointed host is rushing on with a
shout on the other side our walls speeding its way to the city Who
then will rescue us who then of gods and goddesses will aid us Shall I
then prostrate myself before the statues of the divinities Oh ye
blessed beings seated on your glorious thrones tis high time for us
to cling to your statueswhy do we deeply sighing delay Hear ye or
hear ye not the clash of bucklers When if not now shall we set
about the orison of the peplus and chaplets I perceive a din a
crash of no single spear What wilt thou do wilt thou O Mars ancient
guardian of our soil abandon thine own land God of the golden helm
look upon look upon the city which once thou didst hold wellbeloved
Tutelary gods of our country behold behold this train of virgins
suppliant to escape from slavery for around our city a surge of
men with waving crests is rippling stirred by the blasts of Mars But
O Jove sire allperfect avert thoroughly from us capture by the
foemen for Argives are encircling the fortress of Cadmus and I feel a
dread of martial arms and the bits which are fastened through the jaws
of their horses are knelling slaughter And seven leaders of the host
conspicuous in their spearproof harness are taking their stand at our
seventh gate assigned their posts by lot Do thou too O Joveborn
power that delightest in battle Pallas become a savior to our city
and thou equestrian monarch sovereign of the main with thy
fishsmiting trident O Neptune grant a deliverance a deliverance from
our terrors Do thou too O Mars alas alas guard the city which is
named after Cadmus and manifestly show thy careand thou Venus the
original mother of our race avert these illsfor from thy blood are
we sprung calling on thee with heavenward orisons do we approach thee
And thou Lycan king be thou fierce as a wolf to the hostile
army moved by the voice of our sighs Thou too virgindaughter
of Latona deftly adorn thyself with thy bow O beloved Diana Ah ah
ah I hear the rumbling of cars around the city O revered Juno the
naves of the heavyladen axles creak the air is maddened with the
whizzing of javelinswhat is our city undergoing What will become of
it To what point is the deity conducting the issue ah ah A
shower of stones too from their slingers is coming over our battlements
O beloved Apollo there is the clash of brassrimmed shields at the
gates and the just issue in battle must be decided by arms according to
the disposal of Jove And thou Onca immortal queen that
dwellest in front of our city rescue thy sevengated seat O gods
allpotent to save O ye gods and goddesses perfect guardians of the
towers of this land abandon not our warwasted city to an army of
aliens Listen to these virgins listen to our alljust prayers as is
most right to the orisons of virgins which are offered with
outstretched hands O beloved divinities hovering around our city as
its deliverers show how ye love it give heed to our public rituals
and when ye give heed to them succor us and be ye truly mindful I
beseech ye of the rites of our city which abound in sacrifices

Intolerable creatures is this I ask you best and salutary for our
city and an encouragement to this beleagured force for you to fall
before the statues of our tutelary gods to shriek to yellO ye
abominations of the wise Neither in woes nor in welcome prosperity may
I be associated with womankind for when woman prevails her audacity is
more than one can live with and when she is affrighted she is a still
greater mischief to her home and city Even now having brought upon
your countrymen this pellmell flight ye have by your outcries spread
dastard cowardice and ye are serving as best ye may the interests of
those without but we within our walls are suffering capture at our own
hands such blessings will you have if you live along with women
Wherefore if any one give not ear to my authority be it man or woman
or other between these names the fatal pebble shall decide
against him and by no means shall he escape the doom of stoning at the
hand of the populace For what passeth without is a mans concern let
not woman offer advicebut remaining within do thou occasion no
mischief Heardst thou or heardst thou not or am I speaking to a
deaf woman

CH O dear son of OEdipus I felt terror when I heard the din from the
clatter of the cars when the wheelwhirling naves rattled and the
din of the firewrought bits the rudders of the horses passing
through their mouths that know no rest

ET What then does the mariner who flees from the stern to the
prow find means of escape when his bark is laboring against the
billow of the ocean

CH No but I came in haste to the ancient statues of the divinities
trusting in the gods when there was a pattering at our gates of
destructive sleet showering down even then I was carried away by terror
to offer my supplications to the Immortals that they would extend their
protection over the city

ET Pray that our fortification may resist the hostile spear

CH Shall not this then be at the disposal of the gods

ET Ay but tis said that the gods of the captured city abandon it

CH At no time during my life may this conclave of gods abandon us
never may I behold our city overrun and an army firing it with hostile
flame

ET Do not thou invoking the gods take ill counsel for subordination
woman is the mother of saving success so the adage runs

CH But the gods have a power superior still and oft in adversity does
this raise the helpless out of severe calamity when clouds are
overhanging his brow

ET It is the business of men to present victims and offerings of
worship to the gods when foemen are making an attempt tis thine on
the other hand to hold thy peace and abide within doors

CH Tis by the blessing of the gods that we inhabit a city unconquered
and that our fortification is proof against the multitude of our
enemies What Nemesis can feel offended at this

ET I am not offended that ye should honor the race of the gods but
that thou mayest not render the citizens fainthearted keep quiet and
yield not to excessive terrors

CH When I heard the sudden din I came on the very instant in
distracting panic to this Acropolis a hallowed seat

ET Do not now if ye hear of the dying or the wounded eagerly receive
them with shrieks for with this slaughter of mortals is Mars fed

CH And I do in truth hear the snortings of the horses

ET Do not now when thou hearest them hear too distinctly

CH Our city groans from the ground as though the foes were hemming her
in

ET Is it not then enough that I take measures for this

CH I fear for the battering at the gates increases

ET Wilt thou not be silent Say nought of this kind in the city

CH O associate band of gods abandon not our towers

ET Can not ye endure it in silence and confusion to ye

CH Gods of my city let me not meet with slavery

ET Thou thyself art making a slave both of me of thyself and of the
city

CH O allpotent Jove turn the shaft against our foes

ET O Jove what a race hast thou made women

CH Just as wretched as men when their city is taken

ET Again thou art yelping as thou claspest the statues

CH Yes for in my panic terror hurries away my tongue

ET Would to heaven that you would grant me a trifling favor on my
requesting it

CH Tell me as quickly as you can and I shall know at once

ET Hold thy peace wretched woman alarm not thy friends

CH I hold my peacewith others I will suffer what is destined

ET I prefer this expression of thine rather than thy former words and
moreover coming forth from the statues pray thou for the bestthat
the gods may be our allies And after thou hast listened to my prayers
then do thou raise the sacred auspicious shout of the Pan the Grecian
rite of sacrificial acclamation an encouragement to thy friends that
removes the fear of the foe And I to the tutelary gods of our land
both those who haunt the plains and those who watch over the forum and
to the fountains of Dirce and I speak not without those of the
Ismenus if things turn out well and our city is preserved do thus
make my vows that we dyeing the altars of the gods with the blood of
sheep offering bulls to the gods will deposit trophies and vestments
of our enemies spearwon spoils of the foe in their hallowed abodes
Offer thou prayers like these to the gods not with a number of sighs
nor with foolish and wild sobbings for not one whit the more wilt thou
escape Destiny But I too forsooth will go and marshal at the
seven outlets of our walls six men with myself for a seventh
antagonists to our foes in gallant plight before both urgent messengers
and quicklybruited tidings arrive and inflame us by the crisis

CH I attend but through terror my heart sleeps not and cares that
press close upon my heart keep my dread alive because of the host that
hems our walls around like as a dove an allattentive nurse
fears on behalf of her brood serpents evil intruders into her nest
For some are advancing against the towers in all their numbers in all
their array what will become of me and others are launching the vast
rugged stone at the citizens who are assailed on all sides By every
means O ye Jovedescended gods rescue the city and the army that
spring from Cadmus What better plain of land will ye take in exchange
to yourselves than this after ye have abandoned to our enemies the
fertile land and Dirces water best fed of all the streams that
earthencircling Neptune sends forth and the daughters of Tethys
Wherefore O tutelary gods of the city having hurled on those without
the towers the calamity that slaughters men and casts away shields
achieve glory for these citizens and be your statues placed on noble
sites as deliverers of our city through our entreaties fraught
with shrill groanings For sad it is to send prematurely to destruction
an ancient city a prey of slavery to the spear ingloriously overthrown
in crumbling ashes by an Achan according to the will of heaven and for
its women to be dragged away captives alas alas both the young and
the aged like horses by their hair while their vestments are rent
about their persons And the emptied city cries aloud while its booty
is wasted amid confused clamors verily I fearfully forbode heavy
calamities And a mournful thing it is for maidens just
marriageable before the celebration of rites for culling the fresh
flower of their virginity to have to traverse a hateful journey from
their homes What I pronounce that the dead fares better than these
for full many are the calamities alas alas which a city undergoes
when it has been reduced One drags another slaughters and to
parts he sets firethe whole city is defiled with smoke and raving
Mars that tramples down the nations violating piety inspires them
Throughout the town are uproars against the city rises the turreted
circumvallation and man is slain by man with the spear And the
cries of children at the breast all bloody resound and there is rapine
sister of pellmell confusion Pillager meets pillager and the
emptyhanded shouts to the emptyhanded wishing to have a partner
greedy for a portion that shall be neither less nor equal What of these
things can speech picture Fruits of every possible kind strewn
upon the ground occasion sorrow and dismal is the face of the
stewards And full many a gift of earth is swept along in the worthless
streams in undistinguished medley And young female slaves have new
sorrows a foe being superior and fortunate as to their wretched
captive couch so that they hope for lifes gloomy close to come a
guardian against their allmournful sorrows

SEMICH The scout methinks my friends is bringing us some fresh
tidings from the army urging in haste the forwarding axles of his
feet

SEMICH Ay and in very truth here comes our prince son of OEdipus
very opportunely for learning the messengers reportand haste does not
allow him to make equal footsteps

  Reenter MESSENGER and ETEOCLES from different sides

MES I would fain tell for I know them well the arrangements of our
adversaries and how each has obtained his lot at our gate Tydeus now
for some time has been raging hard by the gates of Proetus but the
seer allows him not to cross the stream of Ismenus for the sacrifices
are not auspicious So Tydeus raving and greedy for the fight roars
like a serpent in its hissings beneath the noontide heat and he smites
the sage seer son of Ocleus with a taunt saying that he is
crouching to both Death and Battle out of cowardice Shouting out such
words as these he shakes there shadowy crests the hairy honors of his
helm while beneath his buckler bells cast in brass are shrilly pealing
terror on his buckler too he has this arrogant devicea gleaming sky
tricked out with stars and in the centre of the shield a brilliant full
moon is conspicuous most august of the heavenly bodies the eye of
night Chafing thus in his vaunting harness he roars beside the bank of
the river enamored of conflict like a steed champing his bit with
rage that rushes forth when he hears the voice of the trumpet
Whom wilt thou marshal against this foe Who when the fastenings give
way is fit to be intrusted with the defense of the gate of Proetus

ET At no possible array of a man should I tremble and blazonry has no
power of inflicting wounds and crests and bell bite not without
the spear And for this night which thou tellest me is sparkling on his
buckler with the stars of heaven it may perchance be a prophet in
conceit for if night shall settle on his eyes as he is dying
verily this vaunting device would correctly and justly answer to its
name and he himself will have the insolence ominous against himself
But against Tydeus will I marshal this wary son of Astacus as defender
of the portals full nobly born and one that reverences the throne of
Modesty and detests too haughty language for he is wont to be slow at
base acts but no dastard And from the sown heroes whom Mars spared is
Melanippus sprung a scion and he is thoroughly a native But the event
Mars with his dice will decide And justice his near kinswoman makes
him her champion that he may ward off the foemans spear from the
mother that bare him

CH Now may the gods grant unto our champion to be successful since
with justice does he speed forth in defense of the city but I
shudder to behold the sanguinary fate of those who perish in behalf of
their friends

MES To him may the gods so grant success But Capaneus has by lot
obtained his station against the Electran gate This is a giant greater
than the other aforementioned and his vaunt savors not of humanity but
he threatens horrors against our towers which may fortune not bring to
pass for he declares that whether the god is willing or unwilling he
will make havoc of our city and that not the Wrath of Jove
dashing down upon the plain should stop him And he is wont to compare
both the lightnings and the thunderbolts to the heat of noontide He
has a bearing too a naked man bearing fire and there gleams a torch
with which his hands are armed and in letters of gold he is
uttering I WILL BURN THE CITY Against a man such as this do thou
send Who will engage with him Who will abide his vaunting and
not tremble

ET And in this case also one advantage is gained upon another Of
the vain conceits of man in sooth the tongue of truth becomes accuser
But Capaneus is menacing prepared for action dishonoring the gods and
practicing his tongue in vain exultation mortal as he is he is sending
loudswelling words into heaven to the ears of Jove But I trust that
as he well deserves the firebearing thunderbolt will with justice
come upon him in no wise likened to the noontide warmth of the sun Yet
against him albeit he is a very violent blusterer is a hero marshaled
fiery in his spirit stout Polyphontes a trusty guard by the favor of
Diana our protectress and of the other gods Mention another who hath
had his station fixed at another of our gates

CH May he perish who proudly vaunts against our city and may the
thunderbolt check him before that he bursts into my abode or ever
with his insolent spear force us away from our maiden dwellings

MES And verily I will mention him that hath next had his post allotted
against our gates for to Eteoclus third in order hath the third lot
leapt from the inverted helm of glittering brass for him to advance his
battalion against the gates of Nes and he is wheeling his steeds
fuming in their trappings eager to dash forward against the gates And
their snaffles ring in barbarian fashion filled with the breath of
their snorting nostrils His buckler too hath been blazoned in no
paltry style but a man in armor is treading the steps of a ladder to
his foemens tower seeking to storm it And this man in a combination
of letters is shouting how that not even Mars should force him from
the bulwarks Do thou send also to this man a worthy champion to ward
off from this city the servile yoke

ET I will send this man forthwith and may it be with good fortune and
verily he is sent bearing his boast in deed Megareus the
offspring of Creon of the race of the sown who will go forth from
the gates not a whit terrified at the noise of the mad snortings of the
horses but either by his fall will fully pay the debt of his nurture
to the land or having taken two men and the city on the shield
will garnish with the spoils the house of his father Vaunt thee of
another and spare me not the recital

CH I pray that this side may succeed O champion of my dwellings and
that with them it may go ill and as they with frenzied mind utter
exceedingly proud vaunts against our city so may Jove the avenger
regard them in his wrath

MES Another the fourth who occupies the adjoining gates of Onca
Minerva stands hard by with a shout the shape and mighty mould of
Hippomedon and I shuddered at him as he whirled the immense orb I mean
the circumference of his bucklerI will not deny it And assuredly it
was not any mean artificer in heraldry who produced this work upon his
buckler a Typhon darting forth through his firebreathing mouth dark
smoke the quivering sister of fire and the circular cavity of the
hollowbellied shield hath been made farther solid with coils of
serpents He himself too hath raised the warcry and possessed by
Mars raves for the onslaught like a Thyiad glaring terror Well
must we guard against the attack of such a man as this for Terror is
already vaunting himself hard by our gates

ET In the first place this Onca Pallas who dwells in our suburbs
living near the gates detesting the insolence of the man will drive
him off as a noxious serpent from her young And Hyperbius worthy son
of OEnops hath been chosen to oppose him man to man willing to
essay his destiny in the crisis of fortune he is open to censure
neither in form nor in spirit nor in array of arm but Mercury hath
matched them fairly for hostile is the man to the man with whom he will
have to combat and on their bucklers will they bring into conflict
hostile gods for the one hath firebreathing Typhon and on the buckler
of Hyperbius father Jove is seated firm flashing with his bolt in his
hand and never yet did any one know of Jove being by any chance
vanquished Such in good sooth is the friendship of the
divinities we are on the side of the victors but they on that of the
conquered if at least Jove be mightier in battle than Typhon Wherefore
tis probable that the combatants will fare accordingly and to
Hyperbius in accordance with its blazonry may Jove that is on his
shield become a savior

CH I feel confident that he who hath upon his shield the adversary of
Jove the hateful form of the subterranean fiend a semblance hateful
both to mortals and the everliving gods will have to leave his head
before our gates

MES May such be the issue But farthermore I mention the fifth
marshaled at the fifth gate that of Boreas by the very tomb of
Joveborn Amphion And he makes oath by the spear which he grasps
daring to revere it more than a god and more dearly than his eyes
that verily he will make havoc of the city of the Cadmans in spite of
Jove thus says the fairfaced scion of a mountaindwelling mother a
stripling hero and the down is just making its way through his cheeks
in the spring of his prime thick sprouting hair And he takes his post
having a ruthless spirit not answering to his maidenly name and a
savage aspect Yet not without his vaunt does he take stand against our
gates for on his brazenforged shield the rounded bulwark of his body
he was wielding the reproach of our city the Sphinx of ruthless maw
affixed by means of studs a gleaming embossed form and under her she
holds a man one of the Cadmans so that against this man most
shafts are hurled And he a youth Parthenopus an Arcadian seems to
have come to fight in no short measure and not to disgrace the
length of way that he has traversed for this man such as he is is a
sojourner and by way of fully repaying Argos for the goodly nurture
she has given him he utters against these towers menaces which may the
deity not fulfill

ET O may they receive from the gods the things which they are purposing
in those very unhallowed vaunts Assuredly they would perish most
miserably in utter destruction But there is provided for this man
also the Arcadian of whom you speak a man that is no braggart but his
hand discerns what should be done Actor brother of the one
aforementioned who will not allow either a tongue without deeds
streaming within our gates to aggravate mischiefs nor him to make his
way within who bears upon his hostile buckler the image of the wild
beast most odious monster which from the outside shall find fault with
him who bears it within when it meets with a thick battering under the
city So please the gods may I be speaking the truth

CH The tale pierces my bosom the locks of my hair stand erect when I
hear of the big words of these proudly vaunting impious men Oh
would that the gods would destroy them in the land

MES I will tell of the sixth a man most prudent and in valor the
best the seer the mighty Amphiaraus for he having been marshaled
against the gate of Homolis reviles mighty Tydeus full oft with
reproaches as the homicide the troubler of the state chief teacher of
the mischiefs of Argos the summoner of Erinnys minister of slaughter
and adviser of these mischiefs to Adrastus Then again going up to
thy brother the mighty Polynices he casts his eye aloft and at last
reproachfully dividing his name into syllables he calls to him
and through his mouth he gives utterance to this speechVerily such a
deed is wellpleasing to the gods and glorious to hear of and to tell
in after times that you are making havoc of your paternal city and its
native gods having brought into it a foreign armament And what Justice
shall staunch the fountain of thy mothers tears

And how can thy fatherland after having been taken by the spear
through thy means ever be an ally to thee I for my part in very
truth shall fatten this soil seer as I am buried beneath a hostile
earth Let us to the battle I look not for a dishonorable fall Thus
spake the seer wielding a fairorbed shield all of brass but no
device was on its circlefor he wishes not to seem but to be righteous
reaping fruit from a deep furrow in his mind from which sprout forth
his goodly counsels Against this champion I advise that thou send
antagonists both wise and good A dread adversary is he that reveres
the gods

ET Alas for the omen that associates a righteous man with the
impious Indeed in every matter nothing is worse than evil
fellowshipthe field of infatuation has death for its fruits For
whether it be that a pious man hath embarked in a vessel along with
violent sailors and some villany he perishes with the race of men
abhorred of heaven or being righteous and having rightly fallen into
the same toils with his countrymen violators of hospitality and
unmindful of the gods he is beaten down smitten with the scourge of
the deity which falls alike on all Now this seer I mean the son of
Ocleus a moderate just good and pious man a mighty prophet
associated with unholy boldmouthed men in spite of his better
judgment when they made their long march by the favor of Jove shall
be drawn along with them to go to the distant city I fancy
indeed that he will not make an attack on our gates not as wanting
spirit nor from cowardice of disposition but he knows that it is his
doom to fall in battle if there is to be any fruit in the oracles of
Apollo tis his wont too to hold his peace or to speak what is
seasonable Nevertheless against him we will marshal a man mighty
Lasthenes a porter surly to strangers and who bears an aged mind but
a youthful form quick is his eye and he is not slow of hand to snatch
his spear made naked from his left hand But for mortals to succeed
is a boon of the deity

CH O ye gods give ear to our righteous supplications and graciously
bring it to pass that our city may be successful while ye turn the
horrors wrought by the spear upon the invaders of our country and may
Jove having flung them to a distance from our towers slay them with
his thunderbolt

MES Now will I mention this the seventh against the seventh gate
thine own brotherwhat calamities too he imprecates and prays for
against our city that he having scaled the towers and been
proclaimed to the land after having shouted out the pan of
triumph at the capture may engage with thee and having slain thee
may die beside thee or avenge himself on thee alive that dishonored
that banished him by exile after the very same manner This does
mighty Polynices clamor and he summons the gods of his race and
fatherland to regard his supplications He has moreover a
newlyconstructed shield well suited to his arm and a double device
wrought upon it For a woman is leading on a mailed warrior forged out
of brass conducting him decorously and so she professes to be Justice
as the inscription tells I WILL BRING BACK THIS MAN AND HE SHALL HAVE
THE CITY OF HIS FATHERS AND A DWELLING IN THE PALACE Such are their
devices and do thou thyself now determine whom it is that thou thinkest
proper to send since never at any time shalt thou censure me for my
tidings but do thou thyself determine the management of the vessel of
the state

ET O heavenfrenzied and great abomination of the gods Oh for our
race of OEdipus worthy of all mourningAlas for me now verily are
the curses of my sire coming to an accomplishment But it becomes me not
to weep or wail lest birth be given to a lament yet more intolerable
But to Polynices that well deserves his name I say soon shall we know
what issue his blazonry will have whether letters wrought in gold
vainly vaunting on his buckler along with frenzy of soul will restore
him If indeed Justice the virgin daughter of Jove attended on his
actions or his thoughts perchance this might be But neither when he
escape the darkness of the womb nor in his infancy nor ever in his
boyhood nor in the gathering of the hair on his chin did Justice look
on him or deem him worthy her regards nor truly do I suppose that she
will now take her stand near to him in his illomened possession of his
fatherland Truly she would then in all reason be falsely called
Justice were she to consort with a man alldaring in his soul Trusting
in this I will go and face him in person Who else could do so with
better right Leader against leader brother against brother foeman
with foeman shall I take my stand Bring me with all speed my greaves
my spear and my armor of defense against the stones

  Exit MESSENGER

CH Do not O dearest of men son of OEdipus become in wrath like to
him against whom thou hast most bitterly spoken Enough it is that
Cadmans come to the encounter with Argives For such bloodshed admits
of expiation But the death of own brothers thus mutually wrought by
their own handsof this pollution there is no decay

ET If any one receives evil without disgrace be it so for the only
advantage is among the dead but of evil and disgraceful things thou
canst not tell me honor

CH Why art thou eager my son let not At full of wrath raging with
the spear hurry thee awaybut banish the first impulse of evil
passion

ET Since the deity with all power urges on the matter let the whole
race of Laius abhorred by Phoebus having received for its portion
the wave of Cocytus drift down with the wind

CH So fierce a biting lust for unlawful blood hurries thee on to
perpetrate the shedding of a mans blood of which the fruit is
bitter

ET Ay for the hateful curse of my dear father consummated sits hard
beside me with dry tearless eyes telling me that profit comes before my
after doom

CH But do not accelerate it thou wilt not be called dastardly if thou
honorably preservest thy lifeand Erinnys with her murky
tempest enters not the dwelling where the gods receive a sacrifice from
the hands of the inmates

ET By the gods indeed we have now for some time been in a manner
neglected and the pleasure which arises from our destruction is
welcomed by them why should we any longer fawn upon our deadly
doom

CH Do so now while it is in thy power since the demon that may alter
with a distant shifting of his temper will perchance come with a
gentler air but now he still rages

ET Ay for the curses of OEdipus have raged beyond all bounds and
too true were my visions of phantoms seen in my slumbers dividers of my
fathers wealth

CH Yield thee to women albeit that thou lovest them not

ET Say ye then what one may allow you but it must not be at length

CH Go not thou on in this way to the seventh gate

ET Whetted as I am thou wilt not blunt me by argument

CH Yet god at all events honors an inglorious victory

ET It ill becomes a warrior to acquiesce in this advice

CH What wilt thou shed the blood of thine own brother

ET By heavens leave he shall not elude destruction

  Exit ETEOCLES

CH I shudder with dread that the power that lays waste this house not
like the gods the alltrue the evilboding Erinnys summoned by the
curses of the father is bringing to a consummation the wrathful curses
of distracted OEdipus Tis this quarrel fatal to his sons that
arouses her And the Chalybian stranger emigrant from Scythia is
apportioning their shares a fell divider of possessions the
sternhearted steel allotting them land to occupy just as much
as it may be theirs to possess when dead bereft of their large
domains When they shall have fallen slain by each others hands
in mutual slaughter and the dust of the ground shall have drunk up the
blackclotted blood of murder who will furnish expiation who will
purify them Alas for the fresh troubles mingled with the ancient
horrors of this family for I speak of the ancient transgression with
its speedy punishment yet it abides unto the third generation since
Laus in spite of Apollo who had thrice declared in the central
oracles of Pytho that dying without issue he would save the
state did notwithstanding overcome by his friends in his
infatuation beget his own destruction the parricide OEdipus who
dared to plant in an unhallowed field where he had been reared a
bloody rootTwas frenzy linked the distracted pair and as it were a
sea of troubles brings on one billow that subsides and rears another
triply cloven which too dashes about the stern of our state But
between it and us there stretches a fence at a small interval a tower
in width alone And I fear lest the city should be overcome along
with its princes For the execrations that were uttered long ago are
finding their accomplishment bitter is the settlement and deadly
things in their consummation pass not away The wealth of enterprising
merchants too thickly stowed brings with it a casting overboard
from the stern For whom of mortals did the gods and his fellowinmates
in the city and the many lives of herding men admire so much as
they then honored OEdipus who had banished from the realm the baneful
pest that made men her prey But when he unhappy was apprised of his
wretched marriage despairing in his sorrow with frenzied heart he
perpetrated a twofold horror he deprived himself with parricidal hand
of the eyes that were more precious than his children And indignant
because of his scanty supply of food he sent upon his sons alas
alas a curse horrible in utterance even that they should some time or
other share his substance between them with swordwielding hand and now
I tremble lest the swift Erinnys should be on the point of fulfilling
that prayer

joyous hymn to the savior of our city the averter of mischief or shall
I bewail the miserable and illfated childless commanders who in
very truth correctly according to their name full of rancor
have perished in impious purpose Oh dark and fatal curse of the race
and of OEdipus what horrible chill is this that is falling upon my
heart I like a Thyiad have framed a dirge for the tomb hearing
of the dead dabbled in blood that perished haplesslyverily this
meeting of spears was illomened The imprecation of the father hath
taken full effect and hath not failed and the unbelieving schemes of
Laus have lasted even until now and care is through our city and the
divine declarations lose not their edgeAlas worthy of many a sigh ye
have accomplished this horror surpassing credence and lamentable
sufferings have come indeed This is selfevident the tale of the
messenger is before my eyesDouble are our sorrows double are the
horrors of them that have fallen by mutual slaughter doubly shared are
these consummated sufferings What shall I say What but that of a
certainty troubles on troubles are constant inmates of this house But
my friends ply the speeding stroke of your hands about your heads
before the gale of sighs which ever wafts on its passage the bark on
which no sighs are heard with sable sails the freighted with the dead
untrodden for Apollo the sunless across Acheron and to the invisible
allreceiving shore

But enough for here are coming to this bitter office both Antigone
and Ismene I am assured beyond all doubt that they will send forth a
fitting wail from their lovely deepcinctured bosoms And right it is
that we before the sound of their wailing reach us both ejaculate the
dismalsounding chaunt of Erinnys and sing a hateful pan to Pluto
Alas ye that are the most hapless in your sisterhood of all women that
fling the zone around their robes I weep I mourn and there is no
guile about so as not to be truly wailing from my very soul

SEMICHORUS Alas alas ye frantic youths distrustful of friends and
unsubdued by troubles have wretched seized on your paternal dwelling
with the spear

SEMICH Wretched in sooth were they who found a wretched death to the
bane of their houses

SEMICH Alas alas ye that overthrew the walls of your palace and
having cast an eye on bitter monarchy how have ye now settled your
claims with the steel

SEMICH And too truly hath awful Erinnys brought the curses of their
father OEdipus to a consummation

SEMICH Smitten through your leftSmitten in very truth and through
sides that sprung from a common womb

SEMICH Alas for them wretched Alas for the imprecations of death
which avenged murder by murder

SEMICH Thou speakest of the stroke that pierced through and through
those that were smitten in their houses and in their persons with
speechless rage and the doom of discord brought upon them by the curses
of their father

SEMICH And moreover sighing pervades the city the towers sigh the
land that loved her heroes sighs and for posterity remains the
substance by reason of which by reason of which contention came
upon them whom evil destiny and the issue of death

SEMICH In the fierceness of their hearts they divided between them
the possessions so as to have an equal share but the arbiter
escapes not censure from their friends and joyless was their warfare

SEMICH Smitten by the steel here they lie and smitten by the
steel there await themone may perchance ask whatthe
inheritance of the tombs of their fathers

SEMICH From the house the piercing groan sends forth its sound loudly
over them mourning with a sorrow sufferings as oer its own
melancholy a foe to mirth sincerely weeping from the very soul which
is worn down while I wail for these two princes

SEMICH We may say too of these happy men that they both wrought many
mischiefs to their countrymen and to the ranks of all the strangers
that perished in great numbers in battle

SEMICH Illfated was she that bare them before all women as many as
are mothers of children Having taken to herself her own son for a
husband she brought forth these and they have ended their existence
thus by fraternal hands that dealt mutual slaughter

SEMICH Fraternal in very truth and utterly undone were they by a
severing in no wise amicable by frenzied strife at the consummation of
their feud

SEMICH But their emnity is terminated and in the reeking earth is
their lifeblood mingled and truly are they of the same blood A bitter
arbiter of strife is the stranger from beyond the sea the whetted steel
that bounded forth from the fire and bitter is the horrible distributer
of their substance Mars who hath brought the curse of their father
truly to its consummation

SEMICH Hapless youths They have obtained their portion of
heavenawarded woes and beneath their bodies shall be a fathomless
wealth of earth Alas ye that have made your houses bloom with
many troubles And at its fall these Curses raised the shout of triumph
in shrill strain when the race had been put to flight in total rout a
trophy of At has been reared at the gate at which they smote each
other and having overcome both the demon rested

Tis my duty to announce the good pleasure and the decree of the
senators of the people of this city of Cadmus It is resolved to bury
this body of Eteocles for his attachment to his country with the dear
interment in earth for in repelling our foes he met death in the city
and being pure in respect to the sacred rites of his country blameless
hath he fallen where tis glorious for the young to fall thus indeed
hath it been commissioned me to announce concerning this corpse But it
has been decreed to cast out unburied a prey for dogs this the corpse
of his brother Polynices inasmuch as he would have been the overturner
of the land of Cadmus if some one of the gods had not stood in
opposition to his spear and even now that he is dead he will lie under
the guilt of pollution with the gods of his country whom he having
dishonored was for taking the city by bringing against it a foreign
host So it is resolved that he having been buried dishonorably by
winged fowls should receive his recompense and that neither piling up
by hands of the mound over his tomb should follow nor any one honor him
with shrillvoiced wailings but that he be ungraced with a funeral at
the hands of his friends Such is the decree of the magistracy of the
Cadmans

ANT But I say to the rulers of the Cadmans if not another single
person is willing to take part with me in burying him I will bury him
and will expose myself to peril by burying my brother And I feel
no shame at being guilty of this disobedient insubordination against the
city Powerful is the tie of the common womb from which we sprung from
a wretched mother and a hapless sire Wherefore my soul do thou
willing with the willing share in his woes with the dead thou living
with sisterly feelingand nought shall leanbellied wolves tear his
fleshlet no one suppose it All woman though I be I will contrive a
tomb and a deepdug grave for him bearing earth in the bosomfold of
my fine linen robe and I myself will cover him let none imagine the
contrary an effective scheme shall aid my boldness

HER I bid thee not to act despite the state in this matter

ANT I bid thee not announce to me superfluous things

HER Yet stern is a people that has just escaped troubles

ANT Ay call it sternyet this corpse shall not lie unburied

HER What wilt thou honor with a tomb him whom our state abhors

HER ANT Heretofore he has not been honored by the gods

HER Not so at least before he put this realm in jeopardy

ANT Having suffered injuriously he repaid with injury

HER Ay but this deed of his fell on all instead of one

ANT Contention is the last of the gods to finish a dispute and I
will bury him make no more words

HER Well take thine own wayyet I forbid thee

  Exit HERALD

CH Alas alas O ye fatal Furies proudly triumphant and destructive
to this race ye that have ruined the family of OEdipus from its root
What will become of me What shall I do What can I devise How shall I
have the heart neither to bewail thee nor to escort thee to the tomb
But I dread and shrink from the terror of the citizens Thou at all
events shalt in sooth have many mourners but he wretched one departs
unsighed for having the solitarywailing dirge of his sister Who will
agree to this

SEM Let the state do or not do aught to those who bewail Polynices We
on this side will go and join to escort his funeral procession for both
this sorrow is common to the race and the state at different times
sanctions different maxims of justice

SEM But we will go with this corpse as both the city and justice join
to sanction For next to the Immortals and the might of Jove this man
prevented the city of the Cadmans from being destroyed and thoroughly
overwhelmed by the surge of foreign enemies


  FOOTNOTES

   Lucian in his dialogue entitled Prometheus or
  Caucasus has given occasional imitations of passages in
  this play not however sufficient to amount to a
  paraphrase as Dr Blomfield asserted Besides as Lucian
  lays the scene at Caucasus he would rather seem to have
  had the Prometheus solutus in mind See Schutz Argum
  But the ancients commonly made Caucasus the seat of the
  punishment of Prometheus and as schylus is not over
  particular in his geography it is possible that he may be
  not altogether consistent with himself Lucian makes no
  mention of Strength and Force but brings in Mercury at
  the beginning of the dialogue Moreover Mercury is
  represented in an excellent humor and rallies Prometheus
  goodnaturedly upon his tortures Thus  he says
  Greek eu echei kataptsetai de d kai ho aetos
  apokern to hpar hs panta echois anti ts kals kai
  eumchanou plastiks In regard to the place where
  Prometheus was bound the scene doubtless represented a
  ravine between two precipices rent from each other with a
  distant prospect of some of the places mentioned in the
  wanderings of Io See Schutz ibid But as the whole
  mention of Scythia is an anachronism the less said on
  this point the better Compare however the following
  remarks of Humboldt Cosmos vol ii p  The legend
  of Prometheus and the unbinding of the chains of the
  firebringing Titan on the Caucasus by Hercules in
  journeying eastwardthe ascent of Io from the valley of
  the HybritesSee Griffiths note on v  on Greek
  hybrists potamos which must be a proper nametoward
  the Caucasus and the myth of Phryxus and Helleall point
  to the same path on which Phoenician navigators had
  earlier adventured

   Dindorf in his note rightly approves the elegant
  reading Greek abroton apanthrpon in lieu of the
  frigid Greek abaton See Blomf and Burges As far as
  this play is concerned the tract was not actually
  impassable but it was so to mortals

   Greek lergos  rhadiourgos panourgos kakourgos
  Cf Liddell and Linwood s v The interpretation and
  derivation of the etym magn Greek ho tn anthrpn
  plasts is justly rejected by Dindorf who remarks that
  schylus paid no attention to the fable respecting
  Prometheus being the maker of mankind

   The epithet Greek pantechnou which might perhaps
  be rendered artfull is explained by v  and 

   See Jelf Gk Gr  d

   There seems little doubt that Greek euriazein is
  the right reading Its ironical force answers to Terences
  probe curasti

   I have spelled Sire in all places with a capital
  letter as Jove is evidently meant See my note on v 

   This is not a mere zeugma but is derived from the
  supposition that sight was the chief of the senses and in
  a manner included the rest Cf Plato Tim p  C D
  See the examples adduced by the commentators Schrader on
  Musus  and Boyes Illustrations to Sept c Th 
  Shakespeare has burlesqued this idea in his exquisite

   The difficulties of this passage have been increased
  by no one of the commentators perceiving the evident
  opposition between Greek Theoi and Greek Zeus As in
  the formula Greek  Zeu kai Theoi cf Plato Protag
  p  E Aristoph Plut I with Berglers note Julian
  Cs p    Dionys Hal A R II p  
   ed Sylb so from the time of Homer downward we
  find Greek Zeus constantly mentioned apart from the
  other gods cf Il I   and so also with his
  epithet Greek patr as in v    etc
  Eustath on Il T I p   Greek hoti Zeus
  allachou men hapls patr elechth There is evidently
  therefore the opposition expressed in the text Tis not
  for the other gods ie Greek tois allois theois to
  rule but for Jove alone This view was approved but not
  confirmed by Paley

   See Dindorf

   Paley well observes that there is no objection to
  this interpretation for if Prometheus could endure the
  daily gnawing of his entrails by the vulture the rivets
  wouldnt put him to much trouble Lucian   is content
  with fastening his hands to the two sides of the chasm

   Greek tychs is retained by Dindorf but Greek
  techns is defended by Griffiths and Paley I think with
  Burges that it is a gloss upon Greek Promthes

   Elmsleys reading Greek petra  tade is
  preferred by Dindorf and seems more suitable to the

  the same thing retaining Greek petrais

   Surely we should read this sentence interrogatively
  as in v  Greek p pote mochthn Chr termata tnd

  passage So Burges

   Although Dindorf has left Greek KEANOS before the
  lines beginning with Greek ou dta yet as he in his
  notes p  approves of the opinion of Elmsley to which
  the majority of critics assent I have continued them to
  Prometheus Dindorf after Burges remarks that the
  particles Greek ou dta deceived the copyists who
  thought that they pointed to the commencement of a new
  speakers address He quotes Soph OEd C  Eur
  Alcest  Heracl  sqq where it is used as a
  continuation of a previous argument as in the present
  passage

   It has been remarked that schylus had Pindar in
  mind see Pyth I  and VIII  On this fate of

  I Hygin Fab  and for poetical descriptions

  III  Valer Flacc II  Ovid Met V Fab V 
  Claudian de raptu Pros I  Orph Arg  Strabo
  I p  makes Hesiod acquainted with these eruptions
  See Goettling on Theog  But Prometheus here utters
  a prophecy concerning an eruption that really took place
  during the life of schylus Ol   BC  Cf
  Thucydides III  Cluver Sicil Antig p  and
  Dindorfs clear and learned note There can be little
  doubt but Enceladus and Typhon are only different names
  for the same monster Burges has well remarked the
  resemblance between the Egyptian Typho and the Grecian
  and considers them both as two outward forms of one
  internal idea representing the destructive principle of
  matter opposed to the creative I shall refer the reader
  to Plutarchs entertaining treatise on Isis and Osiris
  but to quote authorities from Herodotus down to the
  Apologetic Fathers would be endless

   I think notwithstanding the arguments of Dindorf
  that Greek orgs nosouss means a mind distempered
  and that Greek logoi mean arguments reasonings
  Boyes who always shows a poetical appreciation of his
  author aptly quotes Spensers Fairy Queen b  c

   Greek aichma is rendered indoles by Paley see
  on Ag  Linwood by authority which is much nearer
  the truth as the spear was anciently used for the
  sceptre Mr Burges opportunely suggests Pindars Greek
  enchos zakoton which he gives to Jupiter Nem vi 

   Asia is here personified

   All commentators from the scholiast downward are
  naturally surprised at this mention of Arabia when
  Prometheus is occupied in describing the countries
  bordering on the Euxine Burges conjectures Greek
  Abarios which he supports with considerable learning
  But although the name Greek Abarides mentioned by
  Suidas might well be given to those who dwelt in unknown
  parts of the earth from the legendary travels of Abaris
  with his arrow yet the epithet Greek areion anthos
  seems to point to some really existing nation while
  Greek Abaries would rather seem proverbial Till then
  we are more certain schylus must still stand chargeable
  with geographical inconsistency

   I have followed Burges and Dindorf although the
  latter retains Greek akamantodetois in his text

   Why Dindorf should have adopted Hermanns frigid
  Greek hypostegazei is not easily seen The reader
  will however find Griffiths footnote well deserving of
  inspection

   Among the mythographi discovered by Maii and
  subsequently edited by Bode the reader will find some
  allegorical explanations of these benefits given by

   Although the Vatican mythologist above quoted
  observes of Prometheus deprehendit prterea rationem

  follow Stanley and Blomfield in understanding these words
  to apply to the omens derived from the flame and smoke
  ascending from the sacrifices

  This writer who constantly has the Athenian dramatists in
  view pursues the narrative of Ios wanderings with an
  evident reference to schylus See other illustrations
  from the poets in Stanleys notes

   The ghost of Argus was doubtless whimsically
  represented but probably without the waste of flour that
  is peculiar to modern stage spectres Perhaps as Burges
  describes a mute in a dress resembling a peacocks tail
  expanded and with a Pans pipe slung to his side which
  ever and anon he seems to sound and with a goad in his
  hand mounted at one end with a representation of a hornet
  or gadfly But this phantom like Macbeths dagger is
  supposed to be in the mind only With a similar idea
  Apuleius Apol p  ed Elm invokes upon milianus in
  the following mild terms At  semper obvias species
  mortuorum quidquid umbrarum est usquam quidquid lemurum
  quidquid manium quidquid larvarum oculis tuis oggerat

   I have followed Dindorfs elegant emendation See his
  note and Blomf on Ag 

   After the remarks of Dindorf and Paley it seems that
  the above must be the sense whether we read Greek hn
  with Hermann or take Greek hs for Greek  hs with
  the above mentioned editor

   Paley remarks that Greek tas pol tychas is used in
  the same manner as in Pers  Greek
  phtharentesshipwrecked see his note or wandering
  He renders the present passage the adventures of her long
  wanderings

   With the earlier circumstances of this narrative
  compare the beautiful story of Psyche in Apuleius Met
  IV p  sqq Elm

   Cf Ag  Greek epei d anankas edy lepadnon

   Greek krnn is the elegant conjecture of Canter
  approved by Dindorf In addition to the remarks of the
  commentators the tradition preserved by Pausanias II 
  greatly confirms this emendation He remarks Greek
  therous de aua sphisin esti ta rheumata pln tn en
  Lern It was probably somewhat proverbial

   I shall not attempt to enter into the muchdisputed
  geography of Ios wanderings So much has been said and
  to so little purpose on this perplexing subject that to
  write additional notes would be only to furnish more
  reasons for doubting

   Probably the Kurban Schutz well observes that the
  words Greek ou pseudnymon could not be applied to an
  epithet of the poets own creation Such too was
  Humboldts idea See my first note on this play

   I think Elmsley has settled the question in favor of
  Greek toion for Greek hoion

   In schylus we seem to read the vehement language of
  an old servant of exploded Titanism with him Jupiter and
  the Olympians are but a new dynasty fresh and exulting
  insolent and capricious the victory just gained and yet
  but imperfectly secured over the mysterious and venerable
  beings who had preceded TIME HEAVEN OCEAN EARTH and
  her gigantic progeny Jupiter is still but half the
  monarch of the world his future fall is not obscurely
  predicted and even while he reigns a gloomy irresistible
  destiny controls his powerQuart Rev xxviii

   I have adopted Dindorfs emendation See his note

   How the cosmoramic effects here described were
  represented on the stage it is difficult to say but such
  descriptions are by no means rare in the poets Compare
  Musus  sqq Lucan I  sqq and a multitude in the
  notes of La Cerda on Virgil n I  and Barthius on
  Claudian Gigant  sqq Nonnus Dionys I p 

   Or of which may Jove the Averter be what his name
  imports See Paley and Linwoods Lex

   This interpretation is now fully established See
  Paley Thus Csar B G I  qui arma ferre possent

  even the Greek achreioi to assist in the common
  defense

   Greek pistoi is to be supplied with Greek
  genoisthe

   Although Greek botr may be compared with the
  Roman pullarius yet the phrase is here probably only
  equivalent to Greek despots manteumatn soon after

   Paley prefers nocturno concilio agitari comparing
  Rhes  Greek tas sas pros eunas phylakes
  elthontes phob nyktgorousi On the authority of
  Griffiths I have supplied Greek tous Achaious before
  Greek epibouleuein

   See Linwood sv Greek stephein Paley compares

   Cf Eum  Greek oikton oiktisaito would
  utter cries of pity Suppl  Greek oikton oiktron
  an hearing one mournful piteous cry The old
  translations rendered it no regret was expressed on
  their countenance

   Perhaps we might render Greek phraxai dam in
  order to keep up the metaphor of the ship Cf Hom Od V
   Greek phraxe de min rhipessi diamperes oisyinsi
  The closing the ports of a vessel to keep out the water
  will best convey the meaning to modern readers

   This seems the true meaning of Greek ephestios
  indigenous in Greece as Blomfield interprets quoting
  Hesych Greek ephestios autochthn enoikos II B
   etc An Athenian audience with their political
  jealousy of Asiatic influence and pride of indigenous
  origin would have appreciated this prayer as heartily as
  the one below v  Greek polin doriponon m prodth
  Heterophn strat which their minds would connect with
  more powerful associations than the mere provincial
  differences of Boeotia and Argos How great a stress was
  laid upon the ridicule of foreign dialect may be seen
  from the reception of Pseudartabas in the Acharnians

   Cf Arist Rhet II   The same sentiment
  though expressed the contrary way occurs in Eur Troad
   Greek Ermia gar polin hotan lab kak Nosei ta tn

   This passage is undoubtedly corrupt but Dindorfs
  conjecture Greek hele d emas phrenas deos hopln ktypos
  potichrimptetai dia pedon boa potatai bremei d
  although ingenious differs too much from the ductus
  literarum to be considered safe Paley from the
  interpretation of the Medicean MS and the reading of
  Robortelli Greek eDIDemnas has conjectured Greek
  DIA de gas emas pedi hoploktypou which seems
  preferable Perhaps we might read Greek epi de gas
  pedioploktypou sin chrimp boa by tmesis for Greek
  epichrimptetai schylus used the compound Greek
  enchriptesthai Suppl  and nothing is more common
  than such a tmesis I doubt whether Greek
  pedioploktypon is not one of schylus own highcrested

   I follow Paleys emendation Greek atais

   See a judicious note of Paleys

   I have borrowed Griffiths translation It seems
  impossible that Greek hagnon telos could ever be a
  personal appeal while Greek sy te evidently shows that
  the address to Pallas Onca was unconnected with the
  preceding line As there is probably a lacuna after
  Greek Diothen it is impossible to arrive at any
  certain meaning

   See Stanley Greek Onka is a Phoenician word
  and epithet of Minerva

   The boys girls etc

   Cf Eur Hippol  sqq

    Greek kai despots men hippikois en thesi
    polys xynoikn hrpas hnias cheroin

   Ie to adore the images placed at the head of the
  vessel See Griffiths

   This farfetched interpretation of an absurd text is
  rightly condemned by W Dindorf in his note who elegantly
  reads with Lud Dindorf Greek hydasi t Ismnou Paley
  has clearly shown the origin of the corruption Linwood is
  equally disinclined to support the common reading

   Blomfield reads Greek eg de g andras the
  change of Greek DEG to Greek DEP being by no means a
  difficult one Linwood agrees with this alteration and
  Dindorf in his notes But Paley still defends the common
  reading thinking that Greek ep echthrois is to be
  taken from the following line I do not think the poet
  would have hazarded a construction so doubtful that we
  might take Greek epi either with Greek andras
  Greek echthrois or by tmesis with Greek ax

   The construction of the exegetical accusative is
  well illustrated in Jelfs Gk Gr   

   I have followed Blomfield and Dindorf in his notes
  in reading Greek kydos toisde politais

   This is perhaps the sense required but with
  Dindorf I can not see how it can be elicited from the
  common reading Perhaps Schneiders Greek artitrophois
  is right which is approved by Dindorf Linwood and
  Paley

   There is the same irregular antithesis between
  Greek allon agei and Greek ta de ta de pyrphorei
  as in Soph Ant  Greek eiche d alla ta men alla d
  ep allois epenmaArs

   See Elmsl on Eur Bacch  I follow Griffiths
  and Paley

   There is much difficulty in the double participle
  Greek pesnkyrsas Dindorf would
  altogether omit Greek kyrsas as a gloss But surely
  Greek pesn was more likely to be added as a gloss
  than Greek kyrsas I think that the fault probably
  lies in Greek pesn

   This passage is scarcely satisfactory but I have
  followed Paley Perhaps if we place a comma after Greek
  hyperterou and treat Greek hs andr d hyp eutych
  as a genitive absolute there will be less abruptness
  Greek elpis esti standing for Greek elpizousi by a
  frequent enallage

   The turgidity of this metaphor is almost too much
  even for schylus

   The multitude of interpretations of the common
  reading are from their uniform absurdity sufficient to
  show that it is corrupt I have chosen the least
  offensive but am still certain that Greek apartizei is
  indefensible Hermann who strange to say is followed by
  Wellauer reads Greek katargizei Blomfield Greek
  katartizei

   Besides Stanleys illustrations see Pricus on
  Apul Apol p  Pelagonius in the Geoponica XVI 
  observes Greek agathou de hippou kai touto tekmrion
  hotan hestks m anechtai alla krotn tn gn hsper
  trechein epithym St Macarius Hom XXIII  Greek
  epan de math ho hippos kai synethisth eis ton polemon
  hotan osphranth kai akous phnn polemou autos hetoims
  erchetai epi tous echthrous hste kai ap auts ts phns
  ptosin empoiein tois polemiois Marmion Canto V

    Marmion like charger in the stall
     That hears without the trumpets call
       Began to chafe and swear

   See Boyes Illustrations p 

   This seems to be the sense of Greek mantis
  ennoia Blomfield would add Greek ennoia to the
  dative which is easier

   So Linwood Justice is styled the near relation of
  Melanippus because he was Greek aischrn argos v
   The scholiast however interprets it Greek to ts
  xyngeneias dikaion

   Dindorfs substitution of Greek dikaias for
  Greek dikais is no improvement Paleys Greek
  dikaios is more elegant but there seems little reason
  for alteration

   Probably nothing more than the lightning is meant
  as Blomfield supposes Paley quotes Eur Cycl 
  Greek peplon krouei Dios brontaisin eis erin ktypn
  And this agrees with the fate of Capaneus as described in
  Soph Antig  sqq Nonnus XXVIII p  Eur
  Phoen  sqq

   Blomfield compares Eur Bacch  Greek thyrsois
  dia cheroin hplismenas But the present construction is
  harsher

   See Blomfield

   I follow Blomfield and Paley

   We embrace this opportunity of making a grammatical
  observation with respect to the older poets which to the
  best of our knowledge has not hitherto been noticed by
  any grammarian or critic Wherever a wish or a prayer is
  expressed either by the single optative mood of the verb
  or with Greek m eithe ei gar eithe gar the verb is
  in the second aorist if it have a distinct second aorist
  otherwise it may be in the present tense but is more
  frequently in the first aoristEdinb Rev xix 

   Ie not bearing a braggart inscription but
  putting confidence in his own valor Greek ou was
  rightly thrown out by Erfurdt See Paley

   Ie from the dragons teeth sown by Cadmus

   Eteoclus and the figure on his
  shield

   Like a Bacchic devotee See Virg n IV  sqq
  So in the Agamemnon v 

    Greek martyrei de moi kasis
    plou xynouros dipsia konis tade

   Cf Ag  Greek Zna de tis epinikia klazn
  Teuxetai phrenn to pan Dindorf would omit all the
  following lines There is some difficulty about the sense
  of Greek prosphileia which I think Pauw best explains
  as meaning such is the god that respectively befriends
  each of these champions

   Cf Apollon Rhod I  Greek Ist nyn dory
  thouron hot perision alln kydos eni ptolemoisin
  aeiromai oude m ophellei Zeus toson hossation per emon
  dory Statius Theb ix ades o mihi dextera tantum
  Tu prsens bellis et inevitable numen Te voco te solam
  superum contemptor adoro See Cerda on Virg n X 

   So Catullus iii  

    Passer delici me puell
    Quem plus illa oculis suis amabat

  And Vathek p  of the English version Nouronihar
  loved her cousin more than her own beautiful eyesOLD
  TRANSLATOR See Valcken on Theocrit xi 

   A pun upon the word Greek parthenos in the
  composition of Parthenopuss name

   The figure on the shield is undoubtedly the one
  meant

   Ie he will fight by wholesale See comm
  Perhaps the English phrase to deal a blow to lend a
  blow is the nearest approximation to this curious idiom
  Boyes quotes some neat illustrations

   This passage is a fair instance of the impossibility
  of construing certain portions of schylus as they are
  edited Dindorf in his notes approves of Dobrees
  emendation Greek kai ton son aut adelphou es patros
  moron Exyptiazn onoma and so Paley except that he
  reads Greek omma with Schutz and renders it oculo in
  patrio OEdipi fatum religiose sublato Blomfields
  Greek prosmoln homosporon seems simpler and in better
  taste Greek homosporon was doubtless obliterated by the
  gloss Greek adelpheon an Ionic form ill suited to the
  senarius and the Greek homoioteleuton caused the
  remainder of the error Burges first proposed Greek
  homosporon in Troad Append p  D As to Paleys idea
  that OEdipus death was caused per contentiorim filii
  indolem I can not find either authority for the fact
  or reason for its mention here and I have therefore
  followed Blomfield Dindorfs translation I can not
  understand The explanations of Greek exyptiazn onoma
  are amusing and that is all

   Ie saying Greek Polyneikes polyneikes Paley
  ingeniously remarks that Greek endateisthai is here
  used in a double sense both of dividing and
  reproaching See his note and cf Phoen  Greek
  alths onoma Polyneik patr etheto soi theia pronoia
  neiken epnymon

   See Griffiths

   Porson and all the subsequent editors have
  bracketed this verse as spurious but the chief objection
  to this sense of Greek karpizesthai seems to be
  obviated by Paley See his note

   Either with Greek palin or Greek polin there
  is much difficulty as without an epithet Greek polis
  seems harshly applied to Hades Paley thinks that Greek
  tn makran refers both to Greek pompn and Greek
  polin Dindorf adopts his usual plan when a difficulty
  occurs and proposes to omit the line Fritzsche truly
  said of this learned critic that if he had the privilege
  of omitting every thing he could not understand the plays
  of the Grecian dramatists would speedily be reduced to a
  collection of fragments

   When the spear was not in use it was held in the
  left hand under the shield See Blomfield

   Sc king or victor Blomfield adopts the former

   This passage is not satisfactory Paley reads
  Greek andrlatn but I am doubtful about Greek ts
   tonde  tropon

   In the original there is perhaps a slight mixture
  of construction Greek haimatos partly depending upon
  Greek karpos implied in Greek pikrokarpon and
  partly upon Greek androktasian Greek androkt
  haim being the slaughter of a man by which his blood
  is shed

   Wellauer denuntians lucrum quod prius erit morte
  posteriore ie victoriam quam sequetur mors And so
  Griffiths and Paley

   Shakespeare uses this name in the opening speech of
  King Henry in part I

    No more the thirsty Erinnys of this soil
    Shall daub her lips with her own childrens blood
        OLD TRANSLATOR

   See above v 

   Somewhat to the same effect is the dream of Atossa
  in the Pers

   I prefer Blomfields transposition to Dindorfs
  correction Greek blapsiphrons which though
  repudiated in the notes is still adopted by Paley

   A noble impersonation of the sword

   Shakespeare King John Act  sc 

    That blood which ownd the breadth of all this isle
    Three foot of it doth hold

  King Henry IV part I Act  sc 

            Fare thee well great heart
    Illweavd ambition how much art thou shrunk
    When that this body did contain a spirit
    A kingdom for it was too small a bound
    But now two paces of the vilest earth
    Is room enough

   Surely the full stop after Greek polin in v 
  should be removed and a colon or mark of hyperbaton
  substituted On looking at Paleys edition I find myself
  anticipated

   This is Griffiths version of this awkward passage
  I should prefer reading Greek alkan with Paley from
  one MS So also Burges

   See my note on Soph Philoct  ed Bohn

   This seems the best way of rendering the bold
  periphrase Greek ho polybotos ain brotn See
  Griffiths

   I follow Paley Dindorf in his notes agrees in
  reading Greek trophas but the metre seems to require
  Greek epikotos Griffiths defends the common reading
  but against the ancient authority of the schol on OEd
  Col  See Blomfield

   Blomfield with reason thinks that a verse has been
  lost

   The care which the Messenger takes to show the
  bright side of the picture first reminds us of
  Northumberlands speech Shakespeare King Henry IV part
  II Act  sc 

    This thou wouldst sayYour son did thus and thus
    Your brother thus so fought the noble Douglas
    Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds
    But in the end to stop mine ear indeed
    Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise
    Ending withbrother son and all are dead
      OLD TRANSL

   This is a good example of the figure chiasmus the
  force of which I have expressed by the bracketed words
  repeated from the two infinities See Latin examples in
  the notes of Arntzenius on Mamertin Geneth  p 
  Pang Vett t i

   The Messenger retires to dress for the Heralds
  part

  Horaces rule Nec quarta loqui persona laboret seems
  to have been drawn from the practice of the Greek stage
  Only three actors were allowed to each of the
  competitordramatists and these were assigned to them by
  lot Hesychius Greek Nemsis hypokritn Thus for
  instance as is remarked by a writer in the Quarterly
  Review in the OEdipus at Colonus v  Ismene goes
  to offer sacrifice and after about forty lines returns
  in the character of Theseus Soon afterward v 
  Antigone is carried off by Creons attendants and returns
  as Theseus after about the same interval as beforeOLD
  TRANSLATION The translator had misquoted the gloss of
  Hesychius

   This is the tragic account See Soph Antig 
  sqq Eurip Phn  sqq But other authors mention
  descendants of both

   Another pun on Greek Polyneiks

   Cf Romeo and Juliet Act  sec 

    I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins

   This passage is confessedly corrupt Paley seems to
  have rightly restored Greek astolon from the Greek
  astolon therida in Robertellis edition This ship as
  he remarks would truly be Greek astolos in opposition
  to the one sent to Delphi which was properly said Greek
  stellesthai epi therian The words Greek astib
  Apollni confirm this opinion In regard to the allusions
  see Stanley and Blomfield also Wyttenbach on Plato
  Phdon sub init

   This repetition of Greek di hn is not altogether
  otiose Their contention for estate was the cause both of
  their being Greek ainomoroi and of the Greek neikos
  that ensued

   Ie the sword Cf v 

   This epithet applied to their ancestral tombs
  doubtless alludes to the violent deaths of Laus and
  OEdipus

   On the enallage Greek smati for Greek smasi
  see Griffiths The poet means to say that this will be all
  their possession after death Still Blomfields reading
  Greek chmati seems more elegant and satisfactory

   Pauw remarks that Polynices is the chief subject of
  Antigones mourning while Ismene bewails Eteocles This
  may illustrate much of the following dialogue as well as
  explain whence Sophocles derived his masterpiece of
  character the Theban martyrheroine Antigone

   Throughout this scene I have followed Dindorfs
  text although many improvements have been made in the
  disposition of the dramatis person Every one will
  confess that the length of Greek i i commonplaces in
  this scene would be much against the play but for the
  animated conclusion a conclusion however that must lose
  all its finest interest to the reader who is unacquainted
  with the Antigone of Sophocles

   Wellauer not Scholfield as Griffiths says defends
  the common reading from Herodot V 

   Greek trachyne But T Burgess emendation Greek
  trachys ge seems better and is approved by Blomfield

   Soph Ant  Greek  gar noeis thaptein sph
  aporrton polei

   I have taken Griffiths translation of what Dindorf
  rightly calls lectio vitiosa and of stuff that no sane
  person can believe came from the hand of schylus Paley
  who has often seen the truth where all others have failed
  ingeniously supposes that Greek ou is a mistaken
  insertion and omitting it takes Greek diatetimtai
  in this sense jam hic non amplius a diis honoratur
  ergo ego eum honorabo See his highly satisfactory note
  to which I will only add that the reasoning of the
  Antigone of Sophocles vss  sqq gives ample
  confirmation to his view of this passage

   Blomfield would either omit this verse or assign it
  to the chorus

There is a growing disapprobation both in Great Britain and America

tend so effectually to the preservation of the Greek and Latin grammars
as their judicious union the fruit of an intelligent compromise with
