TRANSLATORS INTRODUCTION


Ecce Homo is the last prose work that Nietzsche wrote It is true
that the pamphlet Nietzsche contra Wagner was prepared a month
later than the Autobiography but we cannot consider this pamphlet as
anything more than a compilation seeing that it consists entirely of
aphorisms drawn from such previous works as Joyful Wisdom Beyond
Good and Evil The Genealogy of Morals etc Coming at the end of a
year in which he had produced the Case of Wagner The Twilight of the
Idols and The Antichrist Ecce Homo is not only a copingstone
worthy of the wonderful creations of that year but also a fitting
conclusion to his whole life in the form of a grand summing up of his
character as a man his purpose as a reformer and his achievement
as a thinker As if half conscious of his approaching spiritual end
Nietzsche here bids his friends farewell just in the manner in which
in the Twilight of the Idols Aph  Part ix he declares that
every one should be able to take leave of his circle of relatives and
intimates when his time seems to have comethat is to say while he
is still himself while he still knows what he is about and is able
to measure his own life and life in general and speak of both in a
manner which is not vouchsafed to the groaning invalid to the man
lying on his back decrepit and exhausted or to the moribund victim
of some wasting disease Nietzsches spiritual death like his whole
life was in singular harmony with his doctrine he died suddenly
and proudlysword in hand War which heand he alone among all
the philosophers of Christendomhad praised so wholeheartedly at
last struck him down in the full vigour of his manhood and left him
a victim on the battlefieldthe terrible battlefield of thought on
which there is no quarter and for which no Geneva Convention has yet
been established or even thought of

To those who know Nietzsches lifework no apology will be needed
for the form and content of this wonderful work They will know at
least that a man either is or is not aware of his significance and
of the significance of what he has accomplished and that if he is
aware of it then selfrealisation even of the kind which we find
in these pages is neither morbid nor suspicious but necessary and
inevitable Such chapter headings as Why I am so Wise Why I am a
Fatality Why I write such Excellent Bookshowever much they may
have disturbed the equanimity and objectivity in particular of
certain Nietzsche biographers can be regarded as pathological only
in a democratic age in which people have lost all sense of graduation
and rank and in which the virtues of modesty and humility have to be
preached far and wide as a corrective against the vulgar pretensions of
thousands of wretched nobodies For little people can be endured only
as modest citizens or humble Christians If however they demand a
like modesty on the part of the truly great if they raise their voices
against Nietzsches lack of the very virtue they so abundantly possess
or pretend to possess it is time to remind them of Goethes famous
remark Nur Lumpe sind bescheiden Only nobodies are ever modest

It took Nietzsche barely three weeks to write this story of his life
Begun on the  th of October  his fourandfourtieth birthday
it was finished on the th of November of the same year and but
for a few trifling modifications and additions is just as Nietzsche
left it It was not published in Germany until the year  eight
years after Nietzsches death In a letter dated the th of December
 addressed to the musical composer Fuchs the author declares
the object of the work to be to dispose of all discussion doubt and
inquiry concerning his own personality in order to leave the public
mind free to consider merely the things for the sake of which he
existed die Dinge derentwegen ich da bin And true to his
intention Nietzsches honesty in these pages is certainly one of
the most remarkable features about them From the first chapter in
which he frankly acknowledges the decadent elements within him to
the last page whereon he characterises his mission his lifetask
and his achievement by means of the one symbol Dionysus versus
Christeverything comes straight from the shoulder without
hesitation without fear of consequences and above all without
concealment Only in one place does he appear to conceal something and
then he actually leads one to understand that he is doing so It is in
regard to Wagner the greatest friend of his life Who doubts he
says that I old artilleryman that I am would be able if I liked to
point my heavy guns at WagnerBut he adds Everything decisive in
this question I kept to myselfI have loved Wagner p 

To point as many have done to the proximity of all Nietzsches autumn
work of the year  to his breakdown at the beginning of  and
to argue that in all its main features it foretells the catastrophe
that is imminent seems a little too plausible a little too obvious
and simple to require refutation That Nietzsche really was in a state
which in medicine is known as euphoriathat is to say that state
of highest wellbeing and capacity which often precedes a complete
breakdown cannot I suppose be questioned for his style his
penetrating vision and his vigour reach their zenith in the works
written in this autumn of  but the contention that the matter the
substance of these works reveals any signs whatsoever of waning mental
health or as a certain French biographer has it of an inability to
hold himself and his judgments in check is best contradicted by
the internal evidence itself To take just a few examples at random
examine the cold and calculating tone of selfanalysis in Chapter I of
the present work consider the reserve and the restraint with which the
idea in Aphorism  of that chapter is worked outnot to speak of the
restraint and selfmastery in the idea itself namely

To be ones enemys equalthis is the first condition of an
honourable duel Where one despises one cannot wage war Where one
commands where one sees something beneath one one ought not to wage
war My war tactics can be reduced to four principles First I attack
only things that are triumphantif necessary I wait until they become
triumphant Secondly I attack only those things against which I find
no allies against which I stand aloneagainst which I compromise
nobody but myself Thirdly I never make personal attacksI use a
personality merely as a magnifyingglass by means of which I render a
general but elusive and scarcely noticeable evil more apparent
Fourthly I attack only those things from which all personal
differences are excluded in which any such thing as a background of
disagreeable experiences is lacking

And now notice the gentleness with which in Chapter II Wagnerthe
supposed mortal enemy the supposed envied rival to Nietzscheis
treated Are these the words and the thoughts of a man who Has lost or
who is losing control

And even if we confine ourselves simply to the substance of this work
and put the questionIs it a new Nietzsche or the old Nietzsche that
we find in these pages Is it the old countenance with which we are
familiar or are the features distorted awry disfigured What will
the answer be Obviously there is no new or even deformed Nietzsche
here because he is still faithful to the position which he assumed
in Thus spake Zarathustra five years previously and is perfectly
conscious of this fidelity see p  neither can he be even on the
verge of any marked change because the whole of the third chapter
in which he reviews his lifework is simply a reiteration and a
confirmation of his old points of view which are here made all the
more telling by additional arguments suggested no doubt by maturer
thought In fact if anything at all is new in this work it is its
cool certainty its severe deliberateness and its extraordinarily
incisive vision as shown for instance in the summing up of the
genuine import of the third and fourth essays in the Thoughts out of
Season pp     a summing up which a most critical
analysis of the essays in question can but verify Romanticism
idealism Christianity are still scorned and despised another
outlook a nobler braver and more earthly outlook is still upheld
and revered the great yea to life including all that it contains
that is terrible and questionable is still pronounced in the teeth of
pessimists nihilists anarchists Christians and other decadents and
Germany Europes flatland is still subjected to the most relentless
criticism If there are any signs of change besides those of mere
growth in this work they certainly succeed in eluding the most
careful search undertaken with a full knowledge of Nietzsches former
opinions and it would be interesting to know precisely where they are
found by those writers whom the titles of the chapters alone seem so
radically to have perturbed

But the most striking thing of all the miracle so to speak of this
autobiography is the absence from it of that loathing that suggestion
of surfeit with which a life such as the one Nietzsche had led would
have filled any other man even of power approximate to his own This
anchorite who in the last years of his life as a healthy human being
suffered the experience of seeing even his oldest friends including
Rhode show the most complete indifference to his lot this wrestler
with Fate for whom recognition in the persons of Brandes Taine and
Strindberg had come all too late and whom even support sympathy and
help arriving as it did at last through Deussen and from Madame de
Salis Marschlins could no longer cheer or comfortthis was the man
who was able notwithstanding to inscribe the device amor fati upon
his shield on the very eve of his final collapse as a victim of the
unspeakable suffering he had endured

And this final collapse might easily have been foreseen Nietzsches
sensorium as his autobiography proves was probably the most delicate
instrument ever possessed by a human being and with this fragile
structurethe prerequisite by the bye of all geniushis terrible
will compelled him to confront the most profound and most recondite
problems We happen to know from another artist and profound thinker
Benjamin Disraeli who himself had experienced a dangerous breakdown
what the consequences precisely are of indulging in excessive activity
in the sphere of the spirit more particularly when that spirit is
highly organised Disraeli says in Contarini Fleming Part iv chap
v

    I have sometimes half believed although the suspicion is
    mortifying that there is only one step between his state
    who deeply indulges in imaginative meditation and insanity
    for I well remember that at this period of my life when
    I indulged in meditation to a degree that would now be
    impossible and I hope unnecessary my senses sometimes
    appeared to be wandering

And artists are the proper judges of artistsnot Oxford Dons like
Dr Schiller who in his imprudent attempt at dealing with something
for which his pragmatic hands are not sufficiently delicate eagerly
avails himself of popular help in his article on Nietzsche in the
eleventh edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica and implies the
hackneyed and wholly exploded belief that Nietzsches philosophy is
madness in the making As German philosophies however are said to
go to Oxford only when they die we may perhaps conclude from this
want of appreciation in that quarter how very much alive Nietzsches
doctrine still is

Not that Nietzsche went mad so soon but that he went mad so late is
the wonder of wonders Considering the extraordinary amount of work
he did the great task of the transvaluation of all values which he
actually accomplished and the fact that he endured such long years
of solitude which to him the sensitive artist to whom friends were
everything must have been a terrible hardship we can only wonder at
his great health and can well believe his sisters account of the
phenomenal longevity and bodily vigour of his ancestors

No one however who is initiated no one who reads this work with
understanding will be in need of this introductory note of mine for
to all who know these pages must speak for themselves We are no
longer in the nineteenth century We have learned many things since
then and if caution is only one of these things at least it will
prevent us from judging a book such as this one with all its apparent
pontifical pride and surging selfreliance with undue haste or with
that arrogant assurance with which the ignorance of the humble and
the modest has always confronted everything truly great

PREFACE




As it is my intention within a very short time to confront my
fellowmen with the very greatest demand that has ever yet been made
upon them it seems to me above all necessary to declare here who
and what I am As a matter of fact this ought to be pretty well
known already for I have not held my tongue about myself But
the disparity which obtains between the greatness of my task and the
smallness of my contemporaries is revealed by the fact that people
have neither heard me nor yet seen me I live on my own selfmade
credit and it is probably only a prejudice to suppose that I am alive
at all I do but require to speak to any one of the scholars who come
to the OberEngadine in the summer in order to convince myself that I
am not alive Under these circumstances it is a dutyand one
against which my customary reserve and to a still greater degree the
pride of my instincts rebelto say Listen for I am such and such a
person For Heavens sake do not confound me with any one else





I am for instance in no wise a bogey man or moral monster On the
contrary I am the very opposite in nature to the kind of man that
has been honoured hitherto as virtuous Between ourselves it seems
to me that this is precisely a matter on which I may feel proud I
am a disciple of the philosopher Dionysus and I would prefer to be
even a satyr than a saint But just read this book Maybe I have here
succeeded in expressing this contrast in a cheerful and at the same
time sympathetic mannermaybe this is the only purpose of the present
work

The very last thing I should promise to accomplish would be to
improve mankind I do not set up any new idols may old idols only
learn what it costs to have legs of clay To overthrow idols idols
is the name I give to all ideals is much more like my business In
proportion as an ideal world has been falsely assumed reality has been
robbed of its value its meaning and its truthfulness The true
world and the apparent worldin plain English the fictitious world
and reality Hitherto the lie of the ideal has been the curse of
reality by means of it the very source of mankinds instincts has
become mendacious and false so much so that those values have come to
be worshipped which are the exact opposite of the ones which would
ensure mans prosperity his future and his great right to a future





He who knows how to breathe in the air of my writings is conscious
that it is the air of the heights that it is bracing A man must be
built for it otherwise the chances are that it will chill him The
ice is near the loneliness is terriblebut how serenely everything
lies in the sunshine how freely one can breathe how much one feels
lies beneath one Philosophy as I have understood it hitherto is
a voluntary retirement into regions of ice and mountainpeaksthe
seekingout of everything strange and questionable in existence
everything upon which hitherto morality has set its ban Through
long experience derived from such wanderings in forbidden country I
acquired an opinion very different from that which may seem generally
desirable of the causes which hitherto have led to mens moralising
and idealising The secret history of philosophers the psychology of
their great names was revealed to me How much truth can a certain
mind endure how much truth can it darethese questions became for
me ever more and more the actual test of values Error the belief in
the ideal is not blindness error is cowardice Every conquest
every step forward in knowledge is the outcome of courage of hardness
towards ones self of cleanliness towards ones self I do not refute
ideals all I do is to draw on my gloves in their presence Nitimur
in vetitum with this device my philosophy will one day be victorious
for that which has hitherto been most stringently forbidden is without
exception Truth





In my lifework my Zarathustra holds a place apart With it I gave
my fellowmen the greatest gift that has ever been bestowed upon them
This book the voice of which speaks out across the ages is not only
the loftiest book on earth literally the book of mountain airthe
whole phenomenon mankind lies at an incalculable distance beneath
itbut it is also the deepest book born of the inmost abundance of
truth an inexhaustible well into which no pitcher can be lowered
without coming up again laden with gold and with goodness Here it is
not a prophet who speaks one of those gruesome hybrids of sickness
and Will to Power whom men call founders of religions If a man would
not do a sad wrong to his wisdom he must above all give proper
heed to the tonesthe halcyonic tonesthat fall from the lips of
Zarathustra

The most silent words are harbingers of the storm thoughts that come
on doves feet lead the world

The figs fall from the trees they are good and sweet and when they
fall their red skins are rent

A north wind am I unto ripe figs

Thus like figs do these precepts drop down to you my friends now
drink their juice and their sweet pulp

It is autumn all around and clear sky and afternoon

No fanatic speaks to you here this is not a sermon no faith is
demanded in these pages From out an infinite treasure of light and
well of joy drop by drop my words fall outa slow and gentle gait
is the cadence of these discourses Such things can reach only the
most elect it is a rare privilege to be a listener here not every
one who likes can have ears to hear Zarathustra I Is not Zarathustra
because of these things a seducer  But what indeed does he
himself say when for the first time he goes back to his solitude Just
the reverse of that which any Sage Saint Saviour of the world
and other decadent would say Not only his words but he himself is
other than they

Alone do I now go my disciples Get ye also hence and alone Thus
would I have it

Verily I beseech you take your leave of me and arm yourselves
against Zarathustra And better still be ashamed of him Maybe he hath
deceived you

The knight of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies but
also to hate his friends

The man who remaineth a pupil requiteth his teacher but ill And why
would ye not pluck at my wreath

Ye honour me but what if your reverence should one day break down
Take heed lest a statue crush you

Ye say ye believe in Zarathustra But of what account is Zarathustra
Ye are my believers but of what account are all believers

Ye had not yet sought yourselves when ye found me Thus do all
believers therefore is all believing worth so little

Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves and only when ye have all
denied me will I come back unto you

FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE





On this perfect day when everything is ripening and not only the
grapes are getting brown a ray of sunshine has fallen on my life I
looked behind me I looked before me and never have I seen so many
good things all at once Not in vain have I buried my fourandfortieth
year today I had the right to bury itthat in it which still
had life has been saved and is immortal The first book of the
Transvaluation of all Values The Songs of Zarathustra The Twilight
of the Idols my attempt to philosophise with the hammerall these
things are the gift of this year and even of its last quarter How
could I help being thankful to the whole of my life

That is why I am now going to tell myself the story of my life




ECCE HOMO


HOW ONE BECOMES WHAT ONE IS




WHY I AM SO WISE






The happiness of my existence its unique character perhaps consists
in its fatefulness to speak in a riddle as my own father I am already
dead as my own mother I still live and grow old This double origin
taken as it were from the highest and lowest rungs of the ladder of
life at once a decadent and a beginning this if anything explains
that neutrality that freedom from partisanship in regard to the
general problem of existence which perhaps distinguishes me To the
first indications of ascending or of descending life my nostrils are
more sensitive than those of any man that has yet lived In this domain
I am a master to my backboneI know both sides for I am both sides
My father died in his sixandthirtieth year he was delicate lovable
and morbid like one who is preordained to pay simply a flying visita
gracious reminder of life rather than life itself In the same year
that his life declined mine also declined in my sixandthirtieth year
I reached the lowest point in my vitalityI still lived but my eyes
could distinguish nothing that lay three paces away from me At that
timeit was the year I resigned my professorship at Ble lived
through the summer like a shadow in St Moritz and spent the following
winter the most sunless of my life like a shadow in Naumburg This
was my lowest ebb During this period I wrote The Wanderer and His
Shadow Without a doubt I was conversant with shadows then The winter
that followed my first winter in Genoa brought forth that sweetness
and spirituality which is almost inseparable from extreme poverty
of blood and muscle in the shape of The Dawn of Day The perfect
lucidity and cheerfulness the intellectual exuberance even that this
work reflects coincides in my case not only with the most profound
physiological weakness but also with an excess of suffering In the
midst of the agony of a headache which lasted three days accompanied
by violent nausea I was possessed of most singular dialectical
clearness and in absolutely cold blood I then thought out things for
which in my more healthy moments I am not enough of a climber not
sufficiently subtle not sufficiently cold My readers perhaps know
to what extent I consider dialectic a symptom of decadence as for
instance in the most famous of all casesthe case of Socrates All
the morbid disturbances of the intellect even that semistupor which
accompanies fever have unto this day remained completely unknown to
me and for my first information concerning their nature and frequency
I was obliged to have recourse to the learned works which have been
compiled on the subject My circulation is slow No one has ever been
able to detect fever in me A doctor who treated me for some time as
a nerve patient finally declared No there is nothing wrong with
your nerves it is simply I who am nervous It has been absolutely
impossible to ascertain any local degeneration in me nor any organic
stomach trouble however much I may have suffered from profound
weakness of the gastric system as the result of general exhaustion
Even my eye trouble which sometimes approached so parlously near
to blindness was only an effect and not a cause for whenever my
general vital condition improved my power of vision also increased
Having admitted all this do I need to say that I am experienced in
questions of decadence I know them inside and out Even that filigree
art of prehension and comprehension in general that feeling for
delicate shades of difference that psychology of seeing through brick
walls and whatever else I may be able to do was first learnt then
and is the specific gift of that period during which everything in
me was subtilisedobservation itself together with all the organs
of observation To look upon healthier concepts and values from the
standpoint of the sick and conversely to look down upon the secret
work of the instincts of decadence from the standpoint of him who is
laden and selfreliant with the richness of lifethis has been my
longest exercise my principal experience If in anything at all it
was in this that I became a master Today my hand knows the trick I
now have the knack of reversing perspectives the first reason perhaps
why a Transvaluation of all Values has been possible to me alone






For apart from the fact that I am a decadent I am also the reverse of
such a creature Among other things my proof of this is that I always
instinctively select the proper remedy when my spiritual or bodily
health is low whereas the decadent as such invariably chooses those
remedies which are bad for him As a whole I was sound but in certain
details I was a decadent That energy with which I sentenced myself
to absolute solitude and to a severance from all those conditions in
life to which I had grown accustomed my discipline of myself and my
refusal to allow myself to be pampered to be tended hand and foot and
to be doctoredall this betrays the absolute certainty of my instincts
respecting what at that time was most needful to me I placed myself
in my own hands I restored myself to health the first condition of
success in such an undertaking as every physiologist will admit is
that at bottom a man should be sound An intrinsically morbid nature
cannot become healthy On the other hand to an intrinsically sound
nature illness may even constitute a powerful stimulus to life to
a surplus of life It is in this light that I now regard the long
period of illness that I endured it seemed as if I had discovered
life afresh my own self included I tasted all good things and even
trifles in a way in which it was not easy for others to taste themout
of my Will to Health and to Life I made my philosophy For this
should be thoroughly understood it was during those years in which my
vitality reached its lowest point that I ceased from being a pessimist
the instinct of selfrecovery forbade my holding to a philosophy of
poverty and desperation Now by what signs are Natures lucky strokes
recognised among men They are recognised by the fact that any such
lucky stroke gladdens our senses that he is carved from one integral
block which is hard sweet and fragrant as well He enjoys that only
which is good for him his pleasure his desire ceases when the limits
of that which is good for him are overstepped He divines remedies for
injuries he knows how to turn serious accidents to his own advantage
that which does not kill him makes him stronger He instinctively
gathers his material from all he sees hears and experiences He is a
selective principle he rejects much He is always in his own company
whether his intercourse be with books with men or with natural
scenery he honours the things he chooses the things he acknowledges
the things he trusts He reacts slowly to all kinds of stimuli with
that tardiness which long caution and deliberate pride have bred in
himhe tests the approaching stimulus he would not dream of meeting
it halfway He believes neither in illluck nor guilt he can
digest himself and others he knows how to forgethe is strong enough
to make everything turn to his own advantage

Lo then I am the very reverse of a decadent for he whom I have just
described is none other than myself






This double thread of experiences this means of access to two worlds
that seem so far asunder finds in every detail its counterpart in my
own natureI am my own complement I have a second sight as well
as a first And perhaps I also have a third sight By the very nature
of my origin I was allowed an outlook beyond all merely local merely
national and limited horizons it required no effort on my part to be
a good European On the other hand I am perhaps more German than
modern Germansmere Imperial Germanscan hope to beI the last
antipolitical German Be this as it may my ancestors were Polish
noblemen it is owing to them that I have so much race instinct in my
bloodwho knows perhaps even the liberum veto When I think of
the number of times in my travels that I have been accosted as a Pole
even by Poles themselves and how seldom I have been taken for a German
it seems to me as if I belonged to those only who have a sprinkling
of German in them But my mother Franziska Oehler is at any rate
something very German as is also my paternal grandmother Erdmuthe
Krause The latter spent the whole of her youth in good old Weimar
not without coming into contact with Goethes circle Her brother
Krause the Professor of Theology in Knigsberg was called to the
post of General Superintendent at Weimar after Herders death It is
not unlikely that her mother my great grandmother is mentioned in
young Goethes diary under the name of Muthgen She married twice
and her second husband was Superintendent Nietzsche of Eilenburg
In  the year of the great war when Napoleon with his general
staff entered Eilenburg on the th of October she gave birth to a
son As a daughter of Saxony she was a great admirer of Napoleon and
maybe I am so still My father born in  died in  Previous
to taking over the pastorship of the parish of Rcken not far from
Ltzen he lived for some years at the Castle of Altenburg where he
had charge of the education of the four princesses His pupils are the
Queen of Hanover the GrandDuchess Constantine the GrandDuchess of
Oldenburg and the Princess Theresa of SaxeAltenburg He was full of
loyal respect for the Prussian King Frederick William the Fourth from
whom he obtained his living at Rcken the events of  saddened him
extremely As I was born on the  th of October the birthday of the
king above mentioned I naturally received the Hohenzollern names of
Frederick William There was at all events one advantage in the choice
of this day my birthday throughout the whole of my childhood was a day
of public rejoicing I regard it as a great privilege to have had such
a father it even seems to me that this embraces all that I can claim
in the matter of privilegeslife the great yea to life excepted
What I owe to him above all is this that I do not need any special
intention but merely a little patience in order involuntarily to
enter a world of higher and more delicate things There I am at home
there alone does my inmost passion become free The fact that I had
to pay for this privilege almost with my life certainly does not
make it a bad bargain In order to understand even a little of my
Zarathustra perhaps a man must be situated and constituted very much
as I am myselfwith one foot beyond the realm of the living






I have never understood the art of arousing illfeeling against
myselfthis is also something for which I have to thank my
incomparable fathereven when it seemed to me highly desirable
to do so However unChristian it may seem I do not even bear any
illfeeling towards myself Turn my life about as you may you will
find but seldomperhaps indeed only onceany trace of some ones
having shown me illwill You might perhaps discover however too
many traces of goodwill My experiences even with those on whom
every other man has burnt his fingers speak without exception in their
favour I tame every bear I can make even clowns behave decently
During the seven years in which I taught Greek to the sixth form of
the College at Ble I never had occasion to administer a punishment
the laziest youths were diligent in my class The unexpected has
always found me equal to it I must be unprepared in order to keep my
selfcommand Whatever the instrument was even if it were as out of
tune as the instrument man can possibly beit was only when I was
ill that I could not succeed in making it express something that was
worth hearing And how often have I not been told by the instruments
themselves that they had never before heard their voices express such
beautiful things This was said to me most delightfully perhaps by
that young fellow Heinrich von Stein who died at such an unpardonably
early age and who after having considerately asked leave to do
so once appeared in SilsMaria for a three days sojourn telling
everybody there that it was not for the Engadine that he had come
This excellent person who with all the impetuous simplicity of a
young Prussian nobleman had waded deep into the swamp of Wagnerism
and into that of Dbringism into the bargain seemed almost
transformed during these three days by a hurricane of freedom like one
who has been suddenly raised to his full height and given wings Again
and again I said to him that this was all owing to the splendid air
everybody felt the sameone could not stand  feet above Bayreuth
for nothingbut he would not believe me Be this as it may if
I have been the victim of many a small or even great offence it was
not will and least of all illwill that actuated the offenders but
rather as I have already suggested it was goodwill the cause of no
small amount of mischief in f my life about which I had to complain
My experience gave me a right to feel suspicious in regard to all
socalled unselfish instincts in regard to the whole of neighbourly
love which is ever ready and waiting with deeds or with advice To
me it seems that these instincts are a sign of weakness they are an
example of the inability to withstand a stimulusit is only among
decadents that this pity is called a virtue What I reproach the
pitiful with is that they are too ready to forget shame reverence
and the delicacy of feeling which knows how to keep at a distance they
do not remember that this gushing pity stinks of the mob and that it
is next of kin to bad mannersthat pitiful hands may be thrust with
results fatally destructive into a great destiny into a lonely and
wounded retirement and into the privileges with which great guilt
endows one The overcoming of pity I reckon among the noble virtues
In the Temptation of Zarathustra I have imagined a case in which a
great cry of distress reaches his ears in which pity swoops down upon
him like a last sin and would make him break faith with himself To
remain ones own master in such circumstances to keep the sublimity
of ones mission pure in such casespure from the many ignoble and
more shortsighted impulses which come into play in socalled unselfish
actionsthis is the rub the last test perhaps which a Zarathustra
has to undergothe actual proof of his power






In yet another respect I am no more than my father over again and as
it were the continuation of his life after an alltooearly death
Like every man who has never been able to meet his equal and unto
whom the concept retaliation is just as incomprehensible as the
notion of equal rights I have forbidden myself the use of any sort
of measure of security or protectionand also of course of defence
and justificationin all cases in which I have been made the victim
either of trifling or even very great foolishness My form of
retaliation consists in this as soon as possible to set a piece of
cleverness at the heels of an act of stupidity by this means perhaps
it may still be possible to overtake it To speak in a parable I
dispatch a pot of jam in order to get rid of a bitter experience
Let anybody only give me offence I shall retaliate he can be quite
sure of that before long I discover an opportunity of expressing my
thanks to the offender among other things even for the offenceor
of asking him for something which can be more courteous even than
giving It also seems to me that the rudest word the rudest letter
is more goodnatured more straightforward than silence Thosewho
keep silent are almost always lacking in subtlety and refinement of
heart silence is an objection to swallow a grievance must necessarily
produce a bad temperit even upsets the stomach All silent people
are dyspeptic You perceive that I should not like to see rudeness
undervalued it is by far the most humane form of contradiction and
in the midst of modern effeminacy it is one of our first virtues If
one is sufficiently rich for it it may even be a joy to be wrong If
a god were to descend to this earth he would have to do nothing but
wrongto take guilt not punishment on ones shoulders is the first
proof of divinity






Freedom from resentment and the understanding of the nature of
resentmentwho knows how very much after all I am indebted to my long
illness for these two things The problem is not exactly simple a
man must have experienced both through his strength and through his
weakness If illness and weakness are to be charged with anything at
all it is with the fact that when they prevail the very instinct of
recovery which is the instinct of defence and of war in man becomes
decayed He knows not how to get rid of anything how to come to
terms with anything and how to cast anything behind him Everything
wounds him People and things draw importunately near all experiences
strike deep memory is a gathering wound To be ill is a sort of
resentment in itself Against this resentment the invalid has only
one great remedyI call it Russian fatalism that fatalism which
is free from revolt and with which the Russian soldier to whom a
campaign proves unbearable ultimately lays himself down in the snow
To accept nothing more to undertake nothing more to absorb nothing
moreto cease entirely from reacting The tremendous sagacity
of this fatalism which does not always imply merely the courage for
death but which in the most dangerous cases may actually constitute
a selfpreservative measure amounts to a reduction of activity in
the vital functions the slackening down of which is like a sort of
will to hibernate A few steps farther in this direction we find the
fakir who will sleep for weeks in a tomb Owing to the fact that
one would be used up too quickly if one reacted one no longer reacts
at all this is the principle And nothing on earth consumes a man
more quickly than the passion of resentment Mortification morbid
susceptibility the inability to wreak revenge the desire and thirst
for revenge the concoction of every sort of poisonthis is surely the
most injurious manner of reacting which could possibly be conceived by
exhausted men It involves a rapid wasting away of nervous energy an
abnormal increase of detrimental secretions as for instance that
of bile into the stomach To the sick man resentment ought to be more
strictly forbidden than anything elseit is his special danger
unfortunately however it is also his most natural propensity This
was fully grasped by that profound physiologist Buddha His religion
which it would be better to call a system of hygiene in order to avoid
confounding it with a creed so wretched as Christianity depended
for its effect upon the triumph over resentment to make the soul
free therefrom was considered the first step towards recovery Not
through hostility is hostility put to flight through friendship does
hostility end this stands at the beginning of Buddhas teachingthis
is not a precept of morality but of physiology Resentment born of
weakness is not more deleterious to anybody than it is to the weak
man himselfconversely in the case of that man whose nature is
fundamentally a rich one resentment is a superfluous feeling a
feeling to remain master of which is almost a proof of riches Those
of my readers who know the earnestnesswith which my philosophy wages
war against the feelings of revenge and rancour even to the extent of
attacking the doctrine of free will my conflict with Christianity
is only a particular instance of it will understand why I wish to
focus attention upon my own personal attitude and the certainty of
my practical instincts precisely in this matter In my moments of
decadence I forbade myself the indulgence of the above feelings
because they were harmful as soon as my life recovered enough riches
and pride however I regarded them again as forbidden but this time
because they were beneath me That Russian fatalism of which I have
spoken manifested itself in me in such a way that for years I held
tenaciously to almost insufferable conditions places habitations
and companions once chance had placed them on my pathit was better
than changing them than feeling that they could be changed than
revolting against them He who stirred me from this fatalism he
who violently tried to shake me into consciousness seemed to me then
a mortal enemyin point of fact there was danger of death each time
this was done To regard ones self as a destiny not to wish ones
self differentthis in such circumstances is sagacity itself






War on the other hand is something different At heart I am a
warrior Attacking belongs to my instincts To be able to be an
enemy to be an enemymaybe these things presuppose a strong nature
in any case all strong natures involve these things Such natures need
resistance consequently they go in search of obstacles the pathos of
aggression belongs of necessity to strength as much as the feelings
of revenge and of rancour belong to weakness Woman for instance is
revengeful her weakness involves this passion just as it involves
her susceptibility in the presence of other peoples suffering The
strength of the aggressor can be measured by the opposition which
he needs every increase of growth betrays itself by a seeking out
of more formidable opponentsor problems for a philosopher who
is combative challenges even problems to a duel The task is not
to overcome opponents in general but only those opponents against
whom one has to summon all ones strength ones skill and ones
swordsmanshipin fact opponents who are ones equals To be ones
enemys equalthis is the first condition of an honourable duel Where
one despises one cannot wage war Where one commands where one sees
something beneath one one ought not to wage war My war tactics
can be reduced to four principles A First I attack only things that
are triumphantif necessary I wait until they become triumphant
Secondly I attack only those things against which I find no allies
against which I stand aloneagainst which I compromise nobody but
myself I have not yet taken one single step before the public eye
which did not compromise me that is my criterion of a proper mode
of action Thirdly I never make personal attacksI use a personality
merely as a magnifyingglass by means of which I render a general
but elusive and scarcely noticeable evil more apparent In this way I
attacked David Strauss or rather the success given to a senile book by
the cultured classes of Germanyby this means I caught German culture
redhanded In this way I attacked Wagner or rather the falsity or
mongrel instincts of our culture which confounds the superrefined
with the strong and the effete with the great Fourthly I attack
only those things from which all personal differences are excluded in
which any such thing as a background of disagreeable experiences is
lacking On the contrary attacking is to me a proof of goodwill and
in certain circumstances of gratitude By means of it I do honour to
a thing I distinguish a thing whether I associate my name with that
of an institution or a person by being against or for either
is all the same to me If I wage war against Christianity I feel
justified in doing so because in that quarter I have met with no fatal
experiences and difficultiesthe most earnest Christians have always
been kindly disposed to me I personally the most essential opponent
of Christianity am far from holding the individual responsible for
what is the fatality of long ages

May I be allowed to hazard a suggestion concerning one last trait
in my character which in my intercourse with other men has led me
into some difficulties I am gifted with a sense of cleanliness the
keenness of which is phenomenal so much so that I can ascertain
physiologicallythat is to say smellthe proximity nay the inmost
core the entrails of every human soul This sensitiveness of mine
is furnished with psychological antenn wherewith I feel and grasp
every secret the quality of concealed filth lying at the base of many
a human character which may be the inevitable outcome of base blood
and which education may have veneered is revealed to me at the first
glance If my observation has been correct such people whom my sense
of cleanliness rejects also become conscious on their part of the
cautiousness to which my loathing prompts me and this does not make
them any more fragrant In keeping with a custom which I have long
observedpure habits and honesty towards myself are among the first
conditions of my existence I would die in unclean surroundingsI
swim bathe and splash about as it were incessantly in water in
any kind of perfectly transparent and shining element That is why
my relations with my fellows try my patience to no small extent my
humanity does not consist in the fact that I understand the feelings
of my fellows but that I can endure to understand My humanity
is a perpetual process of selfmastery But I need solitudethat is
to say recovery return to myself the breathing of free crisp
bracing air The whole of my Zarathustra is a dithyramb in honour
of solitude or if I have been understood in honour of purity Thank
Heaven it is not in honour of pure foolery He who has an eye for
colour will call him a diamond The loathing of mankind of the rabble
was always my greatest danger Would you hearken to the words spoken
by Zarathustra concerning deliverance from loathing

What forsooth hath come unto me How did I deliver myself from
loathing Who hath made mine eye younger How did I soar to the height
where there are no more rabble sitting about the well

Did my very loathing forge me wings and the strength to scent
fountains afar off Verily to the loftiest heights did I need to fly
to find once more the spring of joyfulness

Oh I found it my brethren Up here on the loftiest height the
spring of joyfulness gusheth forth for me And there is a life at the
well of which no rabble can drink with you

Almost too fiercely dost thou rush for me thou spring of joyfulness
And ofttimes dost thou empty the pitcher again in trying to fill it

And yet must I learn to draw near thee more humbly Far too eagerly
doth my heart jump to meet thee

My heart whereon my summer burneth my short hot melancholy
overblessed summer how my summer heart yearneth for thy coolness

Farewell the lingering affliction of my spring Past is the
wickedness of my snowflakes in June Summer have I become entirely and
summer noontide

A summer in the loftiest heights with cold springs and blessed
stillness oh come my friends that the stillness may wax even more
blessed

For this is our height and our home too high and steep is our
dwelling for all the unclean and their appetites

Do but cast your pure eyes into the well of my joyfulness my friends
How could it thus become muddy It will laugh back at you with its
purity

On the tree called Future do we build our nest eagles shall bring
food in their beaks unto us lonely ones

Verily not the food whereof the unclean might partake They would
think they ate fire and would burn their mouths

Verily no abodes for the unclean do we here hold in readiness To
their bodies our happiness would seem an icecavern and to their
spirits also

And like strong winds will we live above them neighbours to the
eagles companions of the snow and playmates of the sun thus do
strong winds live

And like a wind shall I one day blow amidst them and take away their
souls breath with my spirit thus my future willeth it

Verily a strong wind is Zarathustra to all low lands and this is
his counsel to his foes and to all those who spit and spew Beware of
spitting against the wind

WHY I AM SO CLEVER






Why do I know more things than other people Why in fact am I so
clever I have never pondered over questions that are not questions I
have never squandered my strength Of actual religious difficulties
for instance I have no experience I have never known what it is to
feel sinful In the same way I completely lack any reliable criterion
for ascertaining what constitutes a prick of conscience from all
accounts a prick of conscience does not seem to be a very estimable
thing Once it was done I should hate to leave an action of mine
in the lurch I should prefer completely to omit the evil outcome
the consequences from the problem concerning the value of an action
In the face of evil consequences one is too ready to lose the proper
standpoint from which ones deed ought to be considered A prick of
conscience strikes me as a sort of evil eye Something that has
failed should be honoured all the more jealously precisely because
it has failedthis is much more in keeping with my moralityGod
the immortality of the soul salvation a beyondto all these
notions even as a child I never paid any attention whatsoever nor
did I waste any time upon themmaybe I was never naif enough for
thatI am quite unacquainted with atheism as a result and still
less as an event in my life in me it is inborn instinctive I am
too inquisitive too incredulous too high spirited to be satisfied
with such a palpably clumsy solution of things God is a too palpably
clumsy solution of things a solution which shows a lack of delicacy
towards us thinkersat bottom He is really no more than a coarse
and rude prohibition of us ye shall not think I am much more
interested in another questiona question upon which the salvation
of humanity depends to a far greater degree than it does upon any
piece of theological curiosity I refer to nutrition For ordinary
purposes it may be formulated as follows How precisely must thou
feed thyself in order to attain to thy maximum of power or virt
in the Renaissance styleof virtue free from moralic acid My
experiences in regard to this matter have been as bad as they possibly
could be I am surprised that I set myself this question so late in
life and that it took me so long to draw rational conclusions
from my experiences Only the absolute worth lessness of German
cultureits idealismcan to some extent explain how it was that
precisely in this matter I was so backward that my ignorance was almost
saintly This culture which from first to last teaches one to lose
sight of actual things and to hunt after thoroughly problematic and
socalled ideal aims as for instance classical cultureas if it
were not hopeless from the start to try to unite classical and
German in one concept It is even a little comicaltry and imagine
a classically cultured citizen of LeipzigIndeed I can say that
up to a very mature age my food was entirely badexpressed morally
it was impersonal selfless altruistic to the glory of cooks
and all other fellowChristians It was through the cooking in vogue
at Leipzig for instance together with my first study of Schopenhauer
 that I earnestly renounced my Will to Live To spoil ones
stomach by absorbing insufficient nourishmentthis problem seemed to
my mind solved with admirable felicity by the abovementioned cookery
It is said that in the year  changes were introduced into this
department But as to German cookery in generalwhat has it not got
on its conscience Soup before the meal still called alla tedesca
in the Venetian cookery books of the sixteenth century meat boiled
to shreds vegetables cooked with fat and flour the degeneration of
pastries into paperweights And if you add thereto the absolutely
bestial postprandial drinking habits of the ancients and not alone
of the ancient Germans you will understand where German intellect
took its originthat is to say in sadly disordered intestines
German intellect is indigestion it can assimilate nothing But even
English diet which in comparison with German and indeed with French
alimentation seems to me to constitute a return to Naturethat is
to say to cannibalismis profoundly opposed to my own instincts It
seems to me to give the intellect heavy feet in fact Englishwomens
feet The best cooking is that of Piedmont Alcoholic drinks do
not agree with me a single glass of wine or beer a day is amply
sufficient to turn life into a valley of tears for mein Munich live
my antipodes Although I admit that this knowledge came to me somewhat
late it already formed part of my experience even as a child As a boy
I believed that the drinking of wine and the smoking of tobacco were at
first but the vanities of youths and later merely bad habits Maybe
the poor wine of Naumburg was partly responsible for this poor opinion
of wine in general In order to believe that wine was exhilarating I
should have had to be a Christianin other words I should have had to
believe in what to my mind is an absurdity Strange to say whereas
small quantities of alcohol taken with plenty of water succeed in
making me feel out of sorts large quantities turn me almost into a
rollicking tar Even as a boy I showed my bravado in this respect To
compose a long Latin essay in one night to revise and recopy it to
aspire with my pen to emulating the exactitude and the terseness of my
model Sallust and to pour a few very strong grogs over it allthis
mode of procedure while I was a pupil at the venerable old school of
Pforta was not in the least out of keeping with my physiology nor
perhaps with that of Sallust however much it may have been alien to
dignified Pforta Later on towards the middle of my life I grew more
and more opposed to alcoholic drinks I an opponent of vegetarianism
who have experienced what vegetarianism isjust as Wagner who
converted me back to meat experienced itcannot with sufficient
earnestness advise all more spiritual natures to abstain absolutely
from alcohol Water answers the purpose I have a predilection in
favour of those places where in all directions one has opportunities
of drinking from running brooks Nice Turin Sils In vino Veritas
it seems that here once more I am at variance with the rest of the
world about the concept Truthwith me spirit moves on the face of
the waters Here are a few more indications as to my morality A
heavy meal is digested more easily than an inadequate one The first
principle of a good digestion is that the stomach should become active
as a whole A man ought therefore to know the size of his stomach
For the same reasons all those interminable meals which I call
interrupted sacrificial feasts and which are to be had at any table
dhte are strongly to be deprecated Nothing should be eaten between
meals coffee should be given upcoffee makes one gloomy Tea is
beneficial only in the morning It should be taken in small quantities
but very strong It may be very harmful and indispose you for the
whole day if it be taken the least bit too weak Everybody has his own
standard in this matter often between the narrowest and most delicate
limits In an enervating climate tea is not a good beverage with which
to start the day an hour before taking it an excellent thing is to
drink a cup of thick cocoa feed from oil Remain seated as little as
possible put no trust in any thought that is not born in the open to
the accompaniment of free bodily motionnor in one in which even the
muscles do not celebrate a feast All prejudices take their origin in
the intestines A sedentary life as I have already said elsewhere is
the real sin against the Holy Spirit






To the question of nutrition that of locality and climate is next of
kin Nobody is so constituted as to be able to live everywhere and
anywhere and he who has great duties to perform which lay claim
to all his strength has in this respect a very limited choice
The influence of climate upon the bodily functions affecting their
acceleration or retardation extends so far that a blunder in the
choice of locality and climate is able not only to alienate a man from
his actual duty but also to withhold it from him altogether so that
he never even comes face to face with it Animal vigour never acquires
enough strength in him in order to reach that pitch of artistic freedom
which makes his own soul whisper to him I alone can do that Ever
so slight a tendency to laziness in the intestines once it has become
a habit is quite sufficient to make something mediocre something
German out of a genius the climate of Germany alone is enough to
discourage the strongest and most heroically disposed intestines The
tempo of the bodys functions is closely bound up with the agility or
the clumsiness of the spirits feet spirit itself is indeed only a
form of these organic functions Let anybody make a list of the places
in which men of great intellect have been found and are still found
where wit subtlety and malice constitute happiness where genius
is almost necessarily at home all of them rejoice in exceptionally
dry air Paris Provence Florence Jerusalem Athensthese names
prove something namely that genius is conditioned by dry air by a
pure skythat is to say by rapid organic functions by the constant
and everpresent possibility of procuring for ones self great and
even enormous quantities of strength I have a certain case in mind
in which a man of remarkable intellect and independent spirit became
a narrow craven specialist and a grumpy old crank simply owing to
a lack of subtlety in his instinct for climate And I myself might
have been an example of the same thing if illness had not compelled
me to reason and to reflect upon reason realistically Now that I
have learnt through long practice to read the effects of climatic and
meteorological influences from my own body as though from a very
delicate and reliable instrument and that I am able to calculate the
change in degrees of atmospheric moisture by means of physiological
observations upon myself even on so short a journey as that from
Turin to Milan I think with horror of the ghastly fact that my
whole life until the last ten yearsthe most perilous yearshas
always been spent in the wrong and what to me ought to have been
the most forbidden places Naumburg Pforta Thuringia in general
Leipzig Ble Veniceso many illstarred places for a constitution
like mine If I cannot recall one single happy reminiscence of my
childhood and youth it is nonsense to suppose that socalled moral
causes could account for thisas for instance the incontestable
fact that I lacked companions that could have satisfied me for this
fact is the same today as it ever was and it does not prevent me
from being cheerful and brave But it was ignorance in physiological
mattersthat confounded Idealismthat was the real curse of my
life This was the superfluous and foolish element in my existence
something from which nothing could spring and for which there can be
no settlement and no compensation As the outcome of this Idealism
I regard all the blunders the great aberrations of instinct and
the modest specialisations which drew me aside from the task of my
life as for instance the fact that I became a philologistwhy
not at least a medical man or anything else which might have opened
my eyes My days at Ble the whole of my intellectual routine
including my daily timetable was an absolutely senseless abuse of
extraordinary powers without the slightest compensation for the
strength that I spent without even a thought of what I was squandering
and how its place might be filled I lacked all subtlety in egoism
all the fostering care of an imperative instinct I was in a state
in which one is ready to regard ones self as anybodys equal a
state of disinterestedness a forgetting of ones distance from
otherssomething in short for which I can never forgive myself
When I had wellnigh reached the end of my tether simply because I
had almost reached my end I began to reflect upon the fundamental
absurdity of my lifeIdealism It was illness that first brought
me to reason






After the choice of nutrition the choice of climate and locality the
third matter concerning which one must not on any account make a
blunder is the choice of the manner in which one recuperates ones
strength Here again according to the extent to which a spirit is
sui generis the limits of that which he can allow himselfin other
words the limits of that which is beneficial to himbecome more and
more confined As far as I in particular am concerned reading in
general belongs to my means of recuperation consequently it belongs
to that which rids me of myself to that which enables me to wander
in strange sciences and strange soulsto that in fact about which
I am no longer in earnest Indeed it is while reading that I recover
from my earnestness During the time that I am deeply absorbed in
my work no books are found within my reach it would never occur
to me to allow any one to speak or even to think in my presence
For that is what reading would mean Has any one ever actually
noticed that during the period of profound tension to which the
state of pregnancy condemns not only the mind but also at bottom
the whole organism accident and every kind of external stimulus acts
too acutely and strikes too deep Accident and external stimuli must
as far as possible be avoided a sort of wallingofonesselfin is
one of the primary instinctive precautions of spiritual pregnancy
Shall I allow a strange thought to steal secretly over the wall
For that is what reading would mean The periods of work and
fruitfulness are followed by periods of recuperation come hither
ye delightful intellectual intelligent books Shall I read German
books I must go back six months to catch myself with a book in
my hand What was it An excellent study by Victor Brochard upon the
Greek sceptics in which my Laertiana was used to advantage The
scepticsthe only honourable types among that doublefaced and
sometimes quintuplefaced throng the philosophers Otherwise I
almost always take refuge in the same books altogether their number
is small they are books which are precisely my proper fare It is
not perhaps in my nature to read much and of all sorts a library
makes me ill Neither is it my nature to love much or many kinds of
things Suspicion or even hostility towards new books is much more
akin to my instinctive feeling than toleration largeur de cur
and other forms of neighbourlove  It is to a small number of
old French authors that I always return again and again I believe
only in French culture and regard everything else in Europe which
calls itself culture as a misunderstanding I do not even take
the German kind into consideration The few instances of higher
culture with which I have met in Germany were all French in their
origin The most striking example of this was Madame Cosima Wagner
by far the most decisive voice in matters of taste that I have ever
heard If I do not read but literally love Pascal as the most
instinctive sacrifice to Christianity killing himself inch by inch
first bodily then spiritually according to the terrible consistency
of this most appalling form of inhuman cruelty if I have something
of Montaignes mischievousness in my soul andwho knowsperhaps
also in my body if my artists taste endeavours to defend the names
of Molire Corneille and Racine and not without bitterness against
such a wild genius as Shakespeareall this does not prevent me from
regarding even the latterday Frenchmen also as charming companions
I can think of absolutely no century in history in which a netful of
more inquisitive and at the same time more subtle psychologists could
be drawn up together than in the Paris of the present day Let me
mention a few at randomfor their number is by no means smallPaul
Bourget Pierre Loti Gyp Meilhac Anatole France Jules Lemaitre
or to point to one of strong race a genuine Latin of whom I am
particularly fond Guy de Maupassant Between ourselves I prefer this
generation even to its masters all of whom were corrupted by German
philosophy Taine for instance by Hegel whom he has to thank for
his misunderstanding of great men and great periods Wherever Germany
extends her sway she ruins culture It was the war which first saved
the spirit of France Stendhal is one of the happiest accidents of
my lifefor everything that marks an epoch in it has been brought
to me by accident and never by means of a recommendation He is quite
priceless with his psychologists eye quick at forestalling and
anticipating with his grasp of facts which is reminiscent of the same
art in the greatest of all masters of facts ex ungue Napoleonem
and last but not least as an honest atheista specimen which is
both rare and difficult to discover in Franceall honour to Prosper
Mrime Maybe that I am even envious of Stendhal He robbed
me of the best atheistic joke which I of all people could have
perpetrated Gods only excuse is that He does not exist  I myself
have said somewhereWhat has been the greatest objection to Life
hithertoGod






It was Heinrich Heine who gave me the most perfect idea of what a
lyrical poet could be In vain do I search through all the kingdoms of
antiquity or of modern times for anything to resemble his sweet and
passionate music He possessed that divine wickedness without which
perfection itself becomes unthinkable to meI estimate the value of
men of races according to the extent to which they are unable to
conceive of a god who has not a dash of the satyr in him And with
what mastery he wields his native tongue One day it will be said of
Heine and me that we were by far the greatest artists of the German
language that have ever existed and that we left all the efforts that
mere Germans made in this language an incalculable distance behind
us I must be profoundly related to Byrons Manfred of all the
dark abysses in this work I found the counterparts in my own soulat
the age of thirteen I was ripe for this book Words fail me I have
only a look for those who dare to utter the name of Faust in the
presence of Manfred The Germans are incapable of conceiving
anything sublime for a proof of this look at Schumann Out of anger
for this mawkish Saxon I once deliberately composed a counteroverture
to Manfred of which Hans von Blow declared he had never seen the
like before on paper such compositions amounted to a violation of
Euterpe When I cast about me for my highest formula of Shakespeare
I find invariably but this one that he conceived the type of Csar
Such things a man cannot guesshe either is the thing or he is not
The great poet draws his creations only from out of his own reality
This is so to such an extent that often after a lapse of time he
can no longer endure his own work After casting a glance between
the pages of my Zarathustra I pace my room to and fro for half
an hour at a time unable to overcome an insufferable fit of tears
I know of no more heartrending reading than Shakespeare how a man
must have suffered to be so much in need of playing the clown Is
Hamlet understood It is not doubt but certitude that drives one
mad But in order to feel this one must be profound one must be
an abyss a philosopher We all fear the truth And to make a
confession I feel instinctively certain and convinced that Lord Bacon
is the originator the selftorturer of this most sinister kind of
literature what do I care about the miserable gabble of American
muddlers and blockheads But the power for the greatest realism in
vision is not only compatible with the greatest realism in deeds
with the monstrous in deeds with crimeit actually presupposes the
latter  We do not know half enough about Lord Baconthe first
realist in all the highest acceptation of this wordto be sure of
everything he did everything he willed and everything he experienced
in his inmost soul Let the critics go to hell Suppose I had
christened my Zarathustra with a name not my ownlet us say with
Richard Wagners namethe acumen of two thousand years would not have
sufficed to guess that the author of Human alltooHuman was the
visionary of Zarathustra






As I am speaking here of the recreations of my life I feel I must
express a word or two of gratitude for that which has refreshed me by
far the most heartily and most profoundly This without the slightest
doubt was my intimate relationship with Richard Wagner All my other
relationships with men I treat quite lightly but I would not have the
days I spent at Tribschenthose days of confidence of cheerfulness
of sublime flashes and of profound momentsblotted from my life
at any price I know not what Wagner may have been for others but
no cloud ever darkened our sky And this brings me back again to
FranceI have no arguments against Wagnerites and hoc genus omne
who believe that they do honour to Wagner by believing him to be
like themselves for such people I have only a contemptuous curl of
my lip With a nature like mine which is so strange to everything
Teutonic that even the presence of a German retards my digestion my
first meeting with Wagner was the first moment in my life in which I
breathed freely I felt him I honoured him as a foreigner as the
opposite and the incarnate contradiction of all German virtues We
who as children breathed the marshy atmosphere of the fifties are
necessarily pessimists in regard to the concept German we cannot
be anything else than revolutionarieswe can assent to no state of
affairs which allows the canting bigot to be at the top I care not
a jot whether this canting bigot acts in different colours today
whether he dresses in scarlet or dons the uniform of a hussar Very
well then Wagner was a revolutionaryhe fled from the Germans
As an artist a man has no home in Europe save in Paris that subtlety
of all the five senses which Wagners art presupposes those fingers
that can detect slight gradations psychological morbidityall these
things can be found only in Paris Nowhere else can you meet with
this passion for questions of form this earnestness in matters of
miseenscne which is the Parisian earnestness par excellence
In Germany no one has any idea of the tremendous ambition that fills
the heart of a Parisian artist The German is a good fellow Wagner was
by no means a good fellow But I have already said quite enough
on the subject of Wagners real nature see Beyond Good and Evil
Aphorism  and about those to whom he is most closely related
He is one of the late French romanticists that highsoaring and
heavenaspiring band of artists like Delacroix and Berlioz who in
their inmost nacres are sick and incurable and who are all fanatics
of expression and virtuosos through and through Who in sooth
was the first intelligent follower of Wagner Charles Baudelaire the
very man who first understood Delacroixthat typical decadent in whom
a whole generation of artists saw their reflection he was perhaps the
last of them too What is it that I have never forgiven Wagner
The fact that he condescended to the Germansthat he became a German
Imperialist Wherever Germany spreads she ruins culture






Taking everything into consideration I could never have survived my
youth without Wagnerian music For I was condemned to the society
of Germans If a man wish to get rid of a feeling of insufferable
oppression he has to take to hashish Well I had to take to Wagner
Wagner is the counterpoison to everything essentially Germanthe fact
that he is a poison too I do not deny From the moment that Tristan
was arranged for the pianoall honour to you Herr von BlowI was
a Wagnerite Wagners previous works seemed beneath methey were too
commonplace too German  But to this day I am still seeking for a
work which would be a match to Tristan in dangerous fascination and
possess the same gruesome and dulcet quality of infinity I seek among
all the arts in vain All the quaint features of Leonardo da Vincis
work lose their charm at the sound of the first bar in Tristan
This work is without question Wagners non plus ultra after its
creation the composition of the Mastersingers and of the Ring was
a relaxation to him To become more healthythis in a nature like
Wagners amounts to going backwards The curiosity of the psychologist
is so great in me that I regard it as quite a special privilege
to have lived at the right time and to have lived precisely among
Germans in order to be ripe for this work The world must indeed be
empty for him who has never been unhealthy enough for this infernal
voluptuousness it is allowable it is even imperative to employ a
mystic formula for this purpose I suppose I know better than any one
the prodigious feats of which Wagner was capable the fifty worlds of
strange ecstasies to which no one else had wings to soar and as I am
alive today and strong enough to turn even the most suspicious and
most dangerous things to my own advantage and thus to grow stronger
I declare Wagner to have been the greatest benefactor of my life The
bond which unites us is the fact that we have suffered greater agony
even at each others hands than most men are able to bear nowadays
and this will always keep our names associated in the minds of men
For just as Wagner is merely a misunderstanding among Germans so in
truth am I and ever will be Ye lack two centuries of psychological
and artistic discipline my dear countrymen But ye can never
recover the time lost






To the most exceptional of my readers I should like to say just one
word about what I really exact from music It must be cheerful and yet
profound like an October afternoon It must be original exuberant
and tender and like a dainty soft woman in roguishness and grace  I
shall never admit that a German can understand what music is Those
musicians who are called German the greatest and most famous foremost
are all foreigners either Slavs Croats Italians Dutchmenor Jews
or else like Heinrich Schtz Bach and Hndel they are Germans of
a strong race which is now extinct For my own part I have still
enough of the Pole left in me to let all other music go if only I
can keep Chopin For three reasons I would except Wagners Siegfried
Idyll and perhaps also one or two things of Liszt who excelled all
other musicians in the noble tone of his orchestration and finally
everything that has been produced beyond the Alpsthis side of the
Alps I could not possibly dispense with Rossini and still less
with my Southern soul in music the work of my Venetian maestro Pietro
Gasti And when I say beyond the Alps all I really mean is Venice
If I try to find a new word for music I can never find any other
than Venice I know not how to draw any distinction between tears
and music I do not know how to think either of joy or of the south
without a shudder of fear

On the bridge I stood
Lately in gloomy night
Came a distant song
In golden drops it rolled
Over the glittering rim away
Music gondolas lights
Drunk swam far forth in the gloom

A stringed instrument my soul
Sang imperceptibly moved
A gondola song by stealth
Gleaming for gaudy blessedness
Hearkened any thereto






In all these thingsin the choice of food place climate and
recreationthe instinct of selfpreservation is dominant and this
instinct manifests itself with least ambiguity when it acts as an
instinct of defence To close ones eyes to much to seal ones ears to
much to keep certain things at a distancethis is the first principle
of prudence the first proof of the fact that a man is not an accident
but a necessity The popular word for this instinct of defence is
taste A mans imperative command is not only to say no in cases
where yes would be a sign of disinterestedness but also to say
no as seldom as possible One must part with all that which compels
one to repeat no with ever greater frequency The rationale of this
principle is that all discharges of defensive forces however slight
they may be involve enormous and absolutely superfluous losses when
they become regular and habitual Our greatest expenditure of strength
is made up of those small and most frequent discharges of it The act
of keeping things off of holding them at a distance amounts to a
discharge of strengthdo not deceive yourselves on this pointand
an expenditure of energy directed at purely negative ends Simply by
being compelled to keep constantly on his guard a man may grow so weak
as to be unable any longer to defend himself Suppose I were to step
out of my house and instead of the quiet and aristocratic city of
Turin I were to find a German provincial town my instinct would have
to brace itself together in order to repel all that which would pour in
upon it from this crusheddown and cowardly world Or suppose I were
to find a large German citythat structure of vice in which nothing
grows but where every single thing whether good or bad is squeezed
in from outside In such circumstances should I not be compelled to
become a hedgehog But to have prickles amounts to a squandering of
strength they even constitute a twofold luxury when if we only chose
to do so we could dispense with them and open our hands instead

Another form of prudence and selfdefence consists in trying to
react as seldom as possible and to keep ones self aloof from those
circumstances and conditions wherein one would be condemned as it
were to suspend ones liberty and ones initiative and become a
mere reacting medium As an example of this I point to the intercourse
with books The scholar who in sooth does little else than handle
bookswith the philologist of average attainments their number may
amount to two hundred a dayultimately forgets entirely and completely
the capacity of thinking for himself When he has not a book between
his fingers he cannot think When he thinks he responds to a stimulus
a thought he has readfinally all he does is to react The scholar
exhausts his whole strength in saying either yes or no to matter
which has already been thought out or in criticising ithe is no
longer capable of thought on his own account In him the instinct
of selfdefence has decayed otherwise he would defend himself against
books The scholar is a decadent With my own eyes I have seen gifted
richly endowed and freespirited natures already read to ruins at
thirty and mere wax vestas that have to be rubbed before they can give
off any sparksor thoughts To set to early in the morning at the
break of day in all the fulness and dawn of ones strength and to
read a bookthis I call positively vicious






At this point I can no longer evade a direct answer to the question
how one becomes what one is And in giving it I shall have to
touch upon that masterpiece in the art of selfpreservation which is
selfishness  Granting that ones lifetaskthe determination and
the fate of ones lifetaskgreatly exceeds the average measure of
such things nothing more dangerous could be conceived than to come
face to face with ones self by the side of this lifetask The fact
that one becomes what one is presupposes that one has not the remotest
suspicion of what one is From this standpoint even the blunders of
ones life have their own meaning and value the temporary deviations
and aberrations the moments of hesitation and of modesty the
earnestness wasted upon duties which lie outside the actual lifetask
In these matters great wisdom perhaps even the highest wisdom comes
into activity in these circumstances in which nosce teipsum would
be the sure road to ruin forgetting ones self misunderstanding
ones self belittling ones self narrowing ones self and making
ones self mediocre amount to reason itself Expressed morally to
love ones neighbour and to live for others and for other things
may be the means of protection employed to maintain the hardest
kind of egoism This is the exceptional case in which I contrary
to my principle and conviction take the side of the altruistic
instincts for here they are concerned in subserving selfishness
and selfdiscipline The whole surface of consciousnessfor
consciousness is a surfacemust be kept free from any one of the
great imperatives Beware even of every striking word of every
striking attitude They are all so many risks which the instinct runs
of understanding itself too soon Meanwhile the organising idea
which is destined to become master grows and continues to grow into
the depthsit begins to command it leads you slowly back from your
deviations and aberrations it prepares individual qualities and
capacities which one day will make themselves felt as indispensable
to the whole of your taskstep by step it cultivates all the
serviceable faculties before it ever whispers a word concerning the
dominant task the goal the object and the meaning of it all
Looked at from this standpoint my life is simply amazing For the task
of transvaluing values more capacities were needful perhaps than
could well be found side by side in one individual and above all
antagonistic capacities which had to be free from the mutual strife
and destruction which they involve An order of rank among capacities
distance the art of separating without creating hostility to refrain
from confounding things to keep from reconciling things to possess
enormous multifariousness and yet to be the reverse of chaosall
this was the first condition the long secret work and the artistic
mastery of my instinct Its superior guardianship manifested itself
with such exceeding strength that not once did I ever dream of what
was growing within meuntil suddenly all my capacities were ripe and
one day burst forth in all the perfection of their highest bloom I
cannot remember ever having exerted myself I can point to no trace of
struggle in my life I am the reverse of a heroic nature To will
something to strive after something to have an aim or a desire
in my mindI know none of these things from experience Even at this
moment I look out upon my futurea broad futureas upon a calm
sea no sigh of longing makes a ripple on its surface I have not the
slightest wish that anything should be otherwise than it is I myself
would not be otherwise But in this matter I have always been the
same I have never had a desire A man who after his fourandfortieth
year can say that he has never bothered himself about honours
women or moneynot that they did not come his way It was
thus that I became one day a University ProfessorI had never had
the remotest idea of such a thing for I was scarcely fourandtwenty
years of age In the same way two years previously I had one day
become a philologist in the sense that my first philological work
my start in every way was expressly obtained by my master Ritschl for
publication in his Rheinisches Museum Ritschland I say it
in all reverencewas the only genial scholar that I have ever met
He possessed that pleasant kind of depravity which distinguishes us
Thuringians and which makes even a German sympatheticeven in the
pursuit of truth we prefer to avail ourselves of roundabout ways In
saying this I do not mean to underestimate in any way my Thuringian
brother the intelligent Leopold von Ranke






You may be wondering why I should actually have related all these
trivial and according to traditional accounts insignificant details
to you such action can but tell against me more particularly if I
am fated to figure in great causes To this I reply that these trivial
mattersdiet locality climate and ones mode of recreation the
whole casuistry of selfloveare inconceivably more important than
all that which has hitherto been held in high esteem It is precisely
in this quarter that we must begin to learn afresh All those things
which mankind has valued with such earnestness heretofore are not even
real they are mere creations of fancy or more strictly speaking
lies born of the evil instincts of diseased and in the deepest
sense noxious naturesall the concepts God soul virtue
sin Beyond truth eternal life  But the greatness of
human nature its divinity was sought for in them All questions
of politics of social order of education have been falsified root
and branch owing to the fact that the most noxious men have been
taken for great men and that people were taught to despise the small
things or rather the fundamental things of life If I now choose to
compare myself with those creatures who have hitherto been honoured as
the first among men the difference becomes obvious I do not reckon
the socalled first men even as human beingsfor me they are the
excrements of mankind the products of disease and of the instinct
of revenge they are so many monsters laden with rottenness so many
hopeless incurables who avenge themselves on life I wish to be
the opposite of these people it is my privilege to have the very
sharpest discernment for every sign of healthy instincts There is no
such thing as a morbid trait in me even in times of serious illness
I have never grown morbid and you might seek in vain for a trace of
fanaticism in my nature No one can point to any moment of my life
in which I have assumed either an arrogant or a pathetic attitude
Pathetic attitudes are not in keeping with greatness he who needs
attitudes is false Beware of all picturesque men Life was easyin
fact easiestto me in those periods when it exacted the heaviest
duties from me Whoever could have seen me during the seventy days of
this autumn when without interruption I did a host of things of
the highest rankthings that no man can do nowadayswith a sense of
responsibility for all the ages yet to come would have noticed no sign
of tension in my condition but rather a state of overflowing freshness
and good cheer Never have I eaten with more pleasant sensations
never has my sleep been better I know of no other manner of dealing
with great tasks than as play this as a sign of greatness is
an essential prerequisite The slightest constraint a sombre mien
any hard accent in the voiceall these things are objections to a
man but how much more to his work One must not have nerves
Even to suffer from solitude is an objectionthe only thing I have
always suffered from is multitude At an absurdly tender age in
fact when I was seven years old I already knew that no human speech
would ever reach me did any one ever see me sad on that account At
present I still possess the same affability towards everybody I am
even full of consideration for the lowest in all this there is not
an atom of haughtiness or of secret contempt He whom I despise soon
guesses that he is despised by me the very fact of my existence is
enough to rouse indignation in all those who have polluted blood in
their veins My formula for greatness in man is amor fati the fact
that a man wishes nothing to be different either in front of him or
behind him or for all eternity Not only must the necessary be borne
and on no account concealedall idealism is falsehood in the face of
necessitybut it must also be loved


Footnote  Nietzsche as is well known devoted much time when a
student at Leipzig to the study of three Greek philosophers Theognis
Diogenes Laertius and Democritus This study first bore fruit in the
case of a paper Zur Geschichte der Theognideischen Spruchsammlung
which was subsequently published by the most influential journal of
classical philology in Germany Later however it enabled Nietzsche to
enter for the prize offered by the University of Leipzig for an essay
De fontibus Diogenis Laertii He was successful in gaining the prize
and the treatise was afterwards published in the Rheinisches Museum
and is still quoted as an authority It is to this essay written when
he was twentythree years of age that he here refersTR

latter was coined by Nietzsche The English word multitude should
therefore be understood as signifying multifarious instincts and

by a dominant instinct as in Nietzsches case is of course the only
possible basis of an artistic natureTR




WHY I WRITE SUCH EXCELLENT BOOKS






I am one thing my creations are another Here before I speak of the
books themselves I shall touch upon the question of the understanding
and misunderstanding with which they have met I shall proceed to
do this in as perfunctory a manner as the occasion demands for the
time has by no means come for this question My time has not yet
come either some are born posthumously One s day institutions will
be needed in which men will live and teach as I understand living
and teaching maybe also that by that time chairs will be founded
and endowed for the interpretation of Zarathustra  But I should
regard it as a complete contradiction of myself if I expected to
find ears and eyes for my truths today the fact that no one listens
to me that no one knows how to receive at my hands today is not
only comprehensible it seems to me quite the proper thing I do not
wish to be mistaken for anotherand to this end I must not mistake
myself To repeat what I have already said I can point to but few
instances of illwill in my life and as for literary illwill I
could mention scarcely a single example of it On the other hand I
have met with far too much pure foolery It seems to me that to
take up one of my books is one of the rarest honours that a man can
pay himselfeven supposing that he put his shoes from off his feet
beforehand not to mention boots When on one occasion Dr Heinrich
von Stein honestly complained that he could not understand a word of
my Zarathustra I said to him that this was just as it should be to
have understood six sentences in that bookthat is to say to have
lived themraises a man to a higher level among mortals than modern
men can attain With this feeling of distance how could I even wish to
be read by the moderns whom I know My triumph is just the opposite
of what Schopenhauers wasI say Non legor non legarNot
that I should like to underestimate the pleasure I have derived from
the innocence with which my works have frequently been contradicted
As late as last summer at a time when I was attempting perhaps by
means of my weighty alltooweighty literature to throw the rest of
literature off its balance a certain professor of Berlin University
kindly gave me to understand that I ought really to make use of a
different form no one could read such stuff as I wroteFinally it
was not Germany but Switzerland that presented me with the two most
extreme cases An essay on Beyond Good and Evil by Dr V Widmann in
the paper called the Bund under the heading Nietzsches Dangerous
Book and a general account of all my works from the pen of Herr
Karl Spitteler also in the Bund constitute a maximum in my lifeI
shall not say of what The latter treated my Zarathustra for
instance as advanced exercises in style and expressed the wish
that later on I might try and attend to the question of substance as
well Dr Widmann assured me of his respect for the courage I showed
in endeavouring to abolish all decent feeling Thanks to a little
trick of destiny every sentence in these criticisms seemed with
a consistency that I could but admire to be an inverted truth In
fact it was most remarkable that all one had to do was to transvalue
all values in order to hit the nail on the head with regard to me
instead of striking my head with the nail I am more particularly
anxious therefore to discover an explanation After all no one can
draw more out of things books included than he already knows A man
has no ears for that to which experience has given him no access To
take an extreme case suppose a book contains simply incidents which
lie quite outside the range of general or even rare experiencesuppose
it to be the first language to express a whole series of experiences
In this case nothing it contains will really be heard at all and
thanks to an acoustic delusion people will believe that where nothing
is heard there is nothing to hear This at least has been my
usual experience and proves if you will the originality of my
experience He who thought he had understood something in my work had
as a rule adjusted something in it to his own imagenot infrequently
the very opposite of myself an idealist for instance He who
understood nothing in my work would deny that I was worth considering
at allThe word Superman which designates a type of man that
would be one of natures rarest and luckiest strokes as opposed to
modern men to good men to Christians and other Nihilistsa
word which in the mouth of Zarathustra the annihilator of morality
acquires a very profound meaningis understood almost everywhere and
with perfect innocence in the light of those values to which a flat
contradiction was made manifest in the figure of Zarathustrathat is
to say as an ideal type a higher kind of man half saint and half
genius  Other learned cattle have suspected me of Darwinism on
account of this word even the hero cult of that great unconscious
and involuntary swindler Carlylea cult which I repudiated with
such roguish malicewas recognised in my doctrine Once when I
whispered to a man that he would do better I to seek for the Superman
in a Csar Borgia than in a Parsifal he could not believe his ears
The fact that I am quite free from curiosity in regard to criticisms of
my books more particularly when they appear in newspapers will have
to be forgiven me My friends and my publishers know this and never
speak to me of such things In one particular case I once saw all the
sins that had been committed against a single bookit was Beyond Good
and Evil I could tell you a nice story about it Is it possible that
the NationalZeitunga Prussian paper this comment is for the sake
of my foreign readersfor my own part I beg to state I read only Le
Journal des Dbatsreally and seriously regarded the book as a sign
of the times or a genuine and typical example of Tory philosophy
for which the KreuzZeitung had not sufficient courage






This was said for the benefit of Germans for everywhere else I have
my readersall of them exceptionally intelligent men characters that
have won their spurs and that have been reared in high offices and
superior duties I have even real geniuses among my readers In Vienna
in St Petersburg in Stockholm in Copenhagen in Paris and New
YorkI have been discovered everywhere I have not yet been discovered
in Europes flatlandGermany And to make a confession I rejoice
much more heartily over those who do not read me over those who have
neither heard of my name nor of the word philosophy But whithersoever
I go here in Turin for instance every face brightens and softens
at the sight of me A thing that has flattered me more than anything
else hitherto is the fact that old marketwomen cannot rest until
they have picked out the sweetest of their grapes for me To this
extent must a man be a philosopher It is not in vain that the
Poles are considered as the French among the Slavs A charming Russian
lady will not be mistaken for a single moment concerning my origin
I am not successful at being pompous the most I can do is to appear
embarrassed I can think in German I can feel in GermanI can do
most things but this is beyond my powers My old master Ritschl
went so far as to declare that I planned even my philological treatises
after the manner of a Parisian novelistthat I made them absurdly
thrilling In Paris itself people are surprised at toutes mes audaces
et finessesthe words are Monsieur TainesI fear that even in
the highest forms of the dithyramb that salt will be found pervading
my work which never becomes insipid which never becomes Germanand
that is wit I can do nought else God help me AmenWe all know
some of us even from experience what a longears is Well then I
venture to assert that I have the smallest ears that have ever been
seen This fact is not without interest to womenit seems to me they
feel that I understand them better I am essentially the antiass
and on this account alone a monster in the worlds historyin Greek
and not only in Greek I am the Antichrist






I am to a great extent aware of my privileges as a writer in one
or two cases it has even been brought home to me how very much the
habitual  reading of my works spoils a mans taste Other books
simply cannot be endured after mine and least of all philosophical
ones It is an incomparable distinction to cross the threshold of
this noble and subtle worldin order to do so one must certainly
not be a German it is in short a distinction which one must have
deserved He however who is related to me through loftiness of
will experiences genuine raptures of understanding in my books
for I swoop down from heights into which no bird has ever soared I
know abysses into which no foot has ever slipped People have told
me that it is impossible to lay down a book of minethat I disturb
even the nights rest There is no prouder or at the same time more
subtle kind of books they sometimes attain to the highest pinnacle
of earthly endeavour cynicism to capture their thoughts a man must
have the tenderest fingers as well as the most intrepid fists Any
kind of spiritual decrepitude utterly excludes all intercourse with
themeven any kind of dyspepsia a man must have no nerves but he
must have a cheerful belly Not only the poverty of a mans soul and
its stuffy air excludes all intercourse with them but also and to a
much greater degree cowardice uncleanliness and secret intestinal
revengefulness a word from my lips suffices to make the colour of
all evil instincts rush into a face Among my acquaintances I have
a number of experimental subjects in whom I see depicted all the
different and instructively different reactions which follow upon
a perusal of my works Those who will have nothing to do with the
contents of my books as for instance my socalled friends assume an
impersonal tone concerning them they wish me luck and congratulate
me for having produced another work they also declare that my writings
show progress because they exhale a more cheerful spirit The
thoroughly vicious people the beautiful souls the false from top to
toe do not know in the least what to do with my booksconsequently
with the beautiful consistency of all beautiful souls they regard
my work as beneath them The cattle among my acquaintances the mere
Germans leave me to understand if you please that they are not
always of my opinion though here and there they agree with me I
have heard this said even about Zarathustra Feminism whether in
mankind or in man is likewise a barrier to my writings with it no
one could ever enter into this labyrinth of fearless knowledge To
this end a man must never have spared himself he must have been hard
in his habits in order to be goodhumoured and merry among a host of
inexorable truths When I try to picture the character of a perfect
reader I always imagine a monster of courage and curiosity as well as
of suppleness cunning and prudencein short a born adventurer and
explorer After all I could not describe better than Zarathustra has
done unto whom I really address myself unto whom alone would he reveal
his riddle

Unto you daring explorers and experimenters and unto all who have
ever embarked beneath cunning sails upon terrible seas

Unto you who revel in riddles and in twilight whose souls are lured
by flutes unto every treacherous abyss

For ye care not to grope your way along a thread with craven fingers
and where ye are able to guess ye hate to argue






I will now pass just one or two general remarks about my art of
style To communicate a state an inner tension of pathos by means
of signs including the tempo of these signsthat is the meaning of
every style and in view of the fact that the multiplicity of inner
states in me is enormous I am capable of many kinds of stylein
short the most multifarious art of style that any man has ever had at
his disposal Any style is good which genuinely communicates an inner
condition which does not blunder over the signs over the tempo of the
signs or over moodsall the laws of phrasing are the outcome of
representing moods artistically Good style in itself is a piece of
sheer foolery mere idealism like beauty in itself for instance
or goodness in itself or the thinginitself All this takes for
granted of course that there exist ears that can hear and such men
as are capable and worthy of a like pathos that those are not wanting
unto whom one may communicate ones self Meanwhile my Zarathustra
for instance is still in quest of such peoplealas he will have to
seek a long while yet A man must be worthy of listening to him
And until that time there will be no one who will understand the art
that has been squandered in this book No one has ever existed who has
had more novel more strange and purposely created art forms to fling
to the winds The fact that such things were possible in the German
language still awaited proof formerly I myself would have denied
most emphatically that it was possible Before my time people did not
know what could be done with the German languagewhat could be done
with language in general The art of grand rhythm of grand style in
periods for expressing the tremendous fluctuations of sublime and
superhuman passion was first discovered by me with the dithyramb
entitled The Seven Seals which constitutes the last discourse of
the third part of Zarathustra I soared miles above all that which
heretofore has been called poetry






The fact that the voice which speaks in my works is that of a
psychologist who has not his peer is perhaps the first conclusion
at which a good reader will arrivea reader such as I deserve and
one who reads me just as the good old philologists used to read their
Horace Those propositions about which all the world is fundamentally
agreednot to speak of fashionable philosophy of moralists and
other emptyheaded and cabbagebrained peopleare to me but ingenuous
blunders for instance the belief that altruistic and egoistic
are opposites while all the time the ego itself is merely a supreme
swindle an ideal  There are no such things as egoistic or
altruistic actions both concepts are psychological nonsense Or
the proposition that man pursues happiness or the proposition
that happiness is the reward of virtue  Or the proposition
that pleasure and pain are opposites  Morality the Circe of
mankind has falsified everything psychological root and branchit
has demoralised everything even to the terribly nonsensical point
of calling love unselfish A man must first be firmly poised he
must stand securely on his two legs otherwise he cannot love at
all This indeed the girls know only too well they dont care two
pins about unselfish and merely objective men May I venture to
suggest incidentally that I know women This knowledge is part of my
Dionysian patrimony Who knows maybe I am the first psychologist of
the eternally feminine Women all like me But thats an old story
save of course the abortions among them the emancipated ones those
who lack the wherewithal to have children Thank goodness I am not
willing to let myself be torn to pieces the perfect woman tears you
to pieces when she loves you I know these amiable Mnads Oh what
a dangerous creeping subterranean little beast of prey she is And
so agreeable withal  A little woman pursuing her vengeance would
force open even the iron gates of Fate itself Woman is incalculably
more wicked than man she is also cleverer Goodness in a woman is
already a sign of degeneration All cases of beautiful souls in
women may be traced to a faulty physiological conditionbut I go no
further lest I should become medicynical The struggle for equal
rights is even a symptom of disease every doctor knows this The more
womanly a woman is the more she fights tooth and nail against rights
in general the natural order of things the eternal war between the
sexes assigns to her by far the foremost rank Have people had ears
to hear my definition of love It is the only definition worthy of a
philosopher Love in its means is war in its foundation it is the
mortal hatred of the sexes Have you heard my reply to the question
how a woman can be cured saved in factGive her a child A woman
needs children man is always only a means thus spake Zarathustra
The emancipation of womenthis is the instinctive hatred of
physiologically botchedthat is to say barrenwomen for those of
their sisters who are well constituted the fight against man is
always only a means a pretext a piece of strategy By trying to rise
to Woman per se to Higher Woman to the Ideal Woman all they
wish to do is to lower the general level of womens rank and there are
no more certain means to this end than university education trousers
and the rights of voting cattle Truth to tell the emancipated are
the anarchists in the eternally feminine world the physiological
mishaps the most deeprooted instinct of whom is revenge A whole
species of the most malicious idealismwhich by the bye also
manifests itself in men in Henrik Ibsen for instance that typical
old maidwhose object is to poison the clean conscience the natural
spirit of sexual love And in order to leave no doubt in your minds
in regard to my opinion which on this matter is as honest as it
is severe I will reveal to you one more clause out of my moral code
against vicewith the word vice I combat every kind of opposition
to Nature or if you prefer fine words idealism The clause reads
Preaching of chastity is a public incitement to unnatural practices
All depreciation of the sexual life all the sullying of it by means
of the concept impure is the essential crime against Lifeis the
essential crime against the Holy Spirit of Life

In order to give you some idea of myself as a psychologist let me
take this curious piece of psychological analysis out of the book
Beyond Good and Evil in which it appears I forbid by the bye any
guessing as to whom I am describing in this passage The genius of
the heart as that great anchorite possesses it the divine tempter
and born Pied Piper of consciences whose voice knows how to sink into
the inmost depths of every soul who neither utters a word nor casts a
glance in which some seductive motive or trick does not lie a part
of whose masterliness is that he understands the art of seemingnot
what he is but that which will place a fresh constraint upon his
followers to press ever more closely upon him to follow him ever more
enthusiastically and wholeheartedly The genius of the heart
which makes all loud and selfconceited things hold their tongues and
lend their ears which polishes all rough souls and makes them taste a
new longingto lie placid as a mirror that the deep heavens may be
reflected in them The genius of the heart which teaches the clumsy
and too hasty hand to hesitate and grasp more tenderly which scents
the hidden and forgotten treasure the pearl of goodness and sweet
spirituality beneath thick black ice and is a divining rod for every
grain of gold long buried and imprisoned in heaps of mud and sand
The genius of the heart from contact with which every man goes away
richer not blessed and overcome not as though favoured and crushed
by the good things of others but richer in himself fresher to
himself than before opened up breathed upon and sounded by a thawing
wind more uncertain perhaps more delicate more fragile more
bruised but full of hopes which as yet lack names full of a new will
and striving full of a new unwillingness and counterstriving

THE BIRTH Of TRAGEDY






In order to be fair to the Birth of Tragedy  it is necessary
to forget a few things It created a sensation and even fascinated by
means of its mistakesby means of its application to Wagnerism as
if the latter were the sign of an ascending tendency On that account
alone this treatise was an event in Wagners life thenceforward
great hopes surrounded the name of Wagner Even to this day people
remind me sometimes in the middle of Parsifal that it rests on
my conscience if the opinion that this movement is of great value
to culture at length became prevalent I have often seen the book
quoted as The Second Birth of Tragedy from the Spirit of Music
people had ears only for new formul for Wagners art his object
and his missionand in this way the real hidden value of the book
was overlooked Hellenism and Pessimismthis would have been a
less equivocal title seeing that the book contains the first attempt
at showing how the Greeks succeeded in disposing of pessimismin
what manner they overcame it  Tragedy itself is the proof of
the fact that the Greeks were not pessimists Schopenhauer blundered
here as he blundered in everything elseRegarded impartially
The Birth of Tragedy is a book quite strange to its age no one
would dream that it was begun in the thunder of the battle of Wrth
I thought out these problems on cold September nights beneath the
walls of Metz in the midst of my duties as nurse to the wounded it
would be easier to think that it was written fifty years earlier Its
attitude towards politics is one of indifferenceunGerman
as people would say todayit smells offensively of Hegel only in
one or two formul is it infected with the bitter odour of corpses
which is peculiar to Schopenhauer An ideathe antagonism of the two
concepts Dionysian and Apollonianis translated into metaphysics
history itself is depicted as the development of this idea in tragedy
this antithesis has become unity from this standpoint things which
theretofore had never been face to face are suddenly confronted and
understood and illuminated by each other Opera and revolution
for instance The two decisive innovations in the book are first
the comprehension of the Dionysian phenomenon among the Greeksit
provides the first psychological analysis of this phenomenon and
sees in it the single root of all Greek art and secondly the
comprehension of SocraticismSocrates being presented for the first
time as the instrument of Greek dissolution as a typical decadent
Reason versus Instinct Reason at any cost as a dangerous
lifeundermining force The whole book is profoundly and politely
silent concerning Christianity the latter is neither Apollonian nor
Dionysian it denies all sthetic values which are the only values
that The Birth of Tragedy recognises Christianity is most profoundly
nihilistic whereas in the Dionysian symbol the most extreme limits of
a yeasaying attitude to life are attained In one part of the book the
Christian priesthood is referred to as a perfidious order of goblins
as subterraneans

This start of mine was remarkable beyond measure As a confirmation of
my inmost personal experience I had discovered the only example of this
fact that history possesseswith this I was the first to understand
the amazing Dionysian phenomenon At the same time by recognising
Socrates as a decadent I proved most conclusively that the certainty
of my psychological grasp of things ran very little risk at the hands
of any sort of moral idiosyncrasy to regard morality itself as a
symptom of degeneration is an innovation a unique event of the first
order in the history of knowledge How high I had soared above the
pitifully foolish gabble about Optimism and Pessimism with my two new
doctrines I was the first to see the actual contrast the degenerate
instinct which turns upon life with a subterranean lust of vengeance
Christianity Schopenhauers philosophy and in some respects too
even Platos philosophyin short the whole of idealism in its typical
forms as opposed to a formula of the highest yeasaying to life
born of an abundance and a superabundance of lifea I yeasaying free
from all reserve applying even to suffering and guilt and all that
is questionable and strange in existence This last most joyous
most exuberant and exultant yea to life is not only the highest
but also the profoundest conception and one which is most strictly
confirmed and supported by truth and science Nothing that exists must
be suppressed nothing can be dispensed with Those aspects of life
which Christians and other Nihilists reject belong to an incalculably
higher order in the hierarchy of values than that which the instinct
of degeneration calls good and may call good In order to understand
this a certain courage is necessary and as a prerequisite of this
a certain superfluity of strength for a man can approach only as near
to truth as he has the courage to advancethat is to say everything
depends strictly upon the measure of his strength Knowledge and
the affirmation of reality are just as necessary to the strong man
as cowardice the flight from realityin fact the idealare
necessary to the weak inspired by weakness These people are not
at liberty to knowdecadents stand in need of liesit is one of
their selfpreservative measures He who not only understands the word
Dionysian but understands himself in that term does not require
any refutation of Plato or of Christianity or of Schopenhauerfor
his nose scents decomposition






The extent to which I had by means of these doctrines discovered the
idea of tragedy the ultimate explanation of what the psychology of
tragedy is I discussed finally in The Twilight of the Idols Aph
 part  The saying of yea to life and even to its weirdest
and most difficult problems the will to life rejoicing at its own
infinite vitality in the sacrifice of its highest typesthat is what I
called Dionysian that is what I meant as the bridge to the psychology
of the tragic poet Not to cast out terror and pity or to purge ones
self of dangerous passion by discharging it with vehemencethis was
Aristotles misunderstanding of itbut to be far beyond terror
and pity and to be the eternal lust of Becoming itselfthat lust
which also involves the joy of destruction  In this sense I have
the right to regard myself as the first tragic philosopherthat is
to say the most extreme antithesis and antipodes of a pessimistic
philosopher Before my time no such thing existed as this translation
of the Dionysian phenomenon into philosophic emotion tragic wisdom was
lacking in vain have I sought for signs of it even among the great
Greeks in philosophythose belonging to the two centuries before
Socrates I still remained a little doubtful about Heraclitus in whose
presence alone I felt warmer and more at ease than anywhere else
The yeasaying to the impermanence and annihilation of things which
is the decisive feature of a Dionysian philosophy the yeasaying to
contradiction and war the postulation of Becoming together with the
radical rejection even of the concept Being in all these things at
all events I must recognise him who has come nearest to me in thought
hither to The doctrine of the Eternal Recurrencethat is to say
of the absolute and eternal repetition of all things in periodical
cyclesthis doctrine of Zarathustras might it is true have been
taught before In any case the Stoics who derived nearly all their
fundamental ideas from Heraclitus show traces of it

A tremendous hope finds expression in this work After all I have
absolutely no reason to renounce the hope for a Dionysian future of
music Let us look a century ahead and let us suppose that my attempt
to destroy two millenniums of hostility to Nature and of the violation
of humanity be crowned with success That new party of lifeadvocates
which will undertake the greatest of all tasks the elevation and
perfection of mankind as well as the relentless destruction of all
degenerate and parasitical elements will make that superabundance
of life on earth once more possible out of which the Dionysian
state will perforce arise again I promise the advent of a tragic
age the highest art in the saying of yea to life tragedy will be
born again when mankind has the knowledge of the hardest but most
necessary of wars behind it without however suffering from that
knowledge A psychologist might add that what I heard in Wagnerian
music in my youth and early manhood had nothing whatsoever to do with
Wagner that when I described Dionysian music I described merely
what I personally had heardthat I was compelled instinctively to
translate and transfigure everything into the new spirit which filled
my breast A proof of this and as strong a proof as you could have
is my essay Wagner in Bayreuth in all its decisive psychological
passages I am the only person concernedwithout any hesitation you may
read my name or the word Zarathustra wherever the text contains the
name of Wagner The whole panorama of the dithyrambic artist is the
representation of the already existing author of Zarathustra and
it is drawn with an abysmal depth which does not even once come into
contact with the real Wagner Wagner himself had a notion of the truth
he did not recognise himself in the essayIn this way the idea of
Bayreuth was changed into something which to those who are acquainted
with my Zarathustra will be no riddlethat is to say into the
Great Noon when the highest of the elect will consecrate themselves
for the greatest of all dutieswho knows the vision of a feast which
I may live to see The pathos of the first few pages is universal
history the look which is discussed on page  of the book is the
actual look of Zarathustra Wagner Bayreuth the whole of this petty
German wretchedness is a cloud upon which an infinite Fata Morgana
of the future is reflected Even from the psychological standpoint
all the decisive traits in my character are introduced into Wagners
naturethe juxtaposition of the most brilliant and most fatal forces
a Will to Power such as no man has ever possessedinexorable bravery
in matters spiritual an unlimited power of learning unaccompanied by
depressed powers for action Everything in this essay is a prophecy
the proximity of the resurrection of the Greek spirit the need of men
who will be counterAlexanders who will once more tie the Gordian knot
of Greek culture after it has been cut Listen to the worldhistoric
accent with which the concept sense for the tragic is introduced
on page  there are little else but worldhistoric accents in
this essay This is the strangest kind of objectivity that ever
existed my absolute certainty in regard to what I am projected
itself into any chance realitytruth about myself was voiced from out
appalling depths On pages  and  the style of Zarathustra is
described and foretold with incisive certainty and no more magnificent
expression will ever be found than that on pages  for the event
for which Zarathustra standsthat prodigious act of the purification
and consecration of mankind

THOUGHTS OUT OF SEASON






The four essays composing the Thoughts out of Season are thoroughly
warlike in tone They prove that I was no mere dreamer that I delight
in drawing the swordand perhaps also that my wrist is dangerously
supple The first onslaught  was directed against German culture
upon which I looked down even at that time with unmitigated contempt
Without either sense substance or goal it was simply public
opinion There could be no more dangerous misunderstanding than to
suppose that Germanys success at arms proved anything in favour of
German cultureand still less the triumph of this culture over
that of France The second essay  brings to light that which
is dangerous that which corrodes and poisons life in our manner of
pursuing scientific study Life is diseased thanks to this dehumanised
piece of clockwork and mechanism thanks to the impersonality of
the workman  and the false economy of the division of labour The
object which is culture is lost sight of modern scientific activity
as a means thereto simply produces barbarism In this treatise the
historical sense of which this century is so proud is for the first
time recognised as sickness as a typical symptom of decay In the
third and fourth essays a signpost is set up pointing to a higher
concept of culture to a reestablishment of the notion culture
and two pictures of the hardest selflove and selfdiscipline are
presented two essentially unmodern types full of the most sovereign
contempt for all that which lay around them and was called Empire
Culture Christianity Bismarck and Successthese two types
were Schopenhauer and Wagner or in a word Nietzsche






Of these four attacks the first met with extraordinary success The
stir which it created was in every way gorgeous I had put my finger
on the vulnerable spot of a triumphant nationI had told it that its
victory was not a redletter day for culture but perhaps something
very different The reply rang out from all sides and certainly not
only from old friends of David Strauss whom I had made ridiculous
as the type of a German Philistine of Culture and a man of smug
selfcontentin short as the author of that suburban gospel of his
called The Old and the New Faith the term Philistine of Culture
passed into the current language of Germany after the appearance of my
book These old friends whose vanity as Wrtembergians and Swabians
I had deeply wounded in regarding their unique animal their bird
of Paradise as a trifle comic replied to me as ingenuously and as
grossly as I could have wished The Prussian replies were smarter they
contained more Prussian blue The most disreputable attitude was
assumed by a Leipzig paper the egregious Grentzboten and it cost me
some pains to prevent my indignant friends in Ble from taking action
against it Only a few old gentlemen decided in my favour and for
very diverse and sometimes unaccountable reasons Among them was one
Ewald of Gttingen who made it clear that my attack on Strauss had
been deadly There was also the Hegelian Bruno Bauer who from that
time became one of my most attentive readers In his later years he
liked to refer to me when for instance he wanted to give Herr von
Treitschke the Prussian Historiographer a hint as to where he could
obtain information about the notion Culture of which he Herr von
T had completely lost sight The weightiest and longest notice of my
book and its author appeared in Wrzburg and was written by Professor
Hoffmann an old pupil of the philosopher von Baader The essays made
him foresee a great future for me namely that of bringing about a
sort of crisis and decisive turningpoint in the problem of atheism
of which he recognised in me the most instinctive and most radical
advocate It was atheism that had drawn me to Schopenhauer The review
which received by far the most attention and which excited the most
bitterness was an extraordinarily powerful and plucky appreciation of
my work by Carl Hillebrand a man who was usually so mild and the last
humane German who knew how to wield a pen The article appeared in
the Augsburg Gazette and it can be read today couched in rather
more cautious language among his collected essays In it my work was
referred to as an event as a decisive turningpoint as the first sign
of an awakening as an excellent symptom and as an actual revival
of German earnestness and of German passion in things spiritual
Hillebrand could speak only in the terms of the highest respect of
the form of my book of its consummate taste of its perfect tact in
discriminating between persons and causes he characterised it as the
best polemical work in the German languagethe best performance in
the art of polemics which for Germans is so dangerous and so strongly
to be deprecated Besides confirming my standpoint he laid even
greater stress upon what I had dared to say about the deterioration of
language in Germany nowadays writers assume the airs of Purists
and can no longer even construct a sentence sharing my contempt for
the literary stars of this nation he concluded by expressing his
admiration for my couragethat greatest courage of all which places
the very favourites of the people in the dock  The aftereffects
of this essay of mine proved invaluable to me in my life No one has
ever tried to meddle with me since People are silent In Germany
I am treated with gloomy caution for years I have rejoiced in the
privilege of such absolute freedom of speech as no one nowadays
least of all in the Empire has enough liberty to claim My paradise
is in the shadow of my sword At bottom all I had done was to put
one of Stendhals maxims into practice he advises one to make ones
entrance into society by means of a duel And how well I had chosen my
opponentthe foremost freethinker of Germany As a matter of fact
quite a novel kind of free thought found its expression in this way
up to the present nothing has been more strange and more foreign to my
blood than the whole of that European and American species known as
litres penseurs Incorrigible blockheads and clowns of modern ideas
that they are I feel much more profoundly at variance with them than
with any one of their adversaries They also wish to improve mankind
after their own fashionthat is to say in their own image against
that which I stand for and desire they would wage an implacable war
if only they understood it the whole gang of them still believe in an
ideal  I am the first Immoralist






I should not like to say that the last two essays in the Thoughts
out of Season associated with the names of Schopenhauer and Wagner
respectively serve any special purpose in throwing light upon these
two cases or in formulating their psychological problems This of
course does not apply to a few details Thus for instance in the
second of the two essays with a profound certainty of instinct I
already characterised the elementary factor in Wagners nature as a
theatrical talent which in all his means and inspirations only draws
its final conclusions At bottom my desire in this essay was to do
something very different from writing psychology an unprecedented
educational problem a new understanding of selfdiscipline and
selfdefence carried to the point of hardness a road to greatness
and to worldhistoric duties yearned to find expression Roughly
speaking I seized two famous and theretofore completely undefined
types by the forelock after the manner in which one seizes
opportunities simply in order to speak my mind on certain questions
in order to have a few more formulas signs and means of expression
at my disposal Indeed I actually suggest this with most unearthly
sagacity on page  of Schopenhauer as Educator Plato made use
of Socrates in the same waythat is to say as a cipher for Plato
Now that from some distance I can look back upon the conditions of
which these essays are the testimony I would be loth to deny that they
refer simply to me The essay Wagner in Bayreuth is a vision of my
own future on the other hand my most secret history my development
is written down in Schopenhauer as Educator But above all the
vow I made I What I am today the place I now holdat a height from
which I speak no longer with words but with thunderboltsoh how
far I was from all this in those days But I saw the landI did not
deceive myself for one moment as to the way the sea the dangerand
success The great calm in promising this happy prospect of a future
which must not remain only a promiseIn this book every word has
been lived profoundly and intimately the most painful things are not
lacking in it it contains words which are positively running with
blood But a wind of great freedom blows over the whole even its
wounds do not constitute an objection As to what I understand by being
a philosopherthat is to say a terrible explosive in the presence
of which everything is in danger as to how I sever my idea of the
philosopher by miles from that other idea of him which includes even a
Kant not to speak of the academic ruminators and other professors of
philosophyconcerning all these things this essay provides invaluable
information even granting that at bottom it is not Schopenhauer as
Educator but Nietzsche as Educator who speaks his sentiments in
it Considering that in those days my trade was that of a scholar
and perhaps also that I understood my trade the piece of austere
scholar psychology which suddenly makes its appearance in this essay is
not without importance it expresses the feeling of distance and my
profound certainty regarding what was my real lifetask and what were
merely means intervals and accessory work to me My wisdom consists
in my having been many things and in many places in order to become
one thingin order to be able to attain to one thing It was part of
my fate to be a scholar for a while


Footnote  The Purists constitute a definite body in Germany which
is called the Deutscher SprachVerein Their object is to banish
every foreign word from the language and they carry this process of
ostracism even into the domain of the menu where their efforts at
rendering the meaning of French dishes are extremely comical Strange
to say their principal organ and their other publications are by
no means free either from solecisms or faults of style and it is
doubtless to this curious anomaly that Nietzsche here refersTR




HUMAN ALLTOOHUMAN






Human alltooHuman with its two sequels is the memorial of a
crisis It is called a book for free spirits almost every sentence in
it is the expression of a triumphby means of it I purged myself of
everything in me which was foreign to my nature Idealism is foreign
to me the title of the book means Where ye see ideal things I
seehuman alas alltoohuman things  I know men better The
word free spirit in this book must not be understood as anything
else than a spirit that has become free that has once more taken
possession of itself My tone the pitch of my voice has completely
changed the book will be thought clever cool and at times both
hard and scornful A certain spirituality of noble taste seems to
be ever struggling to dominate a passionate torrent at its feet In
this respect there is some sense in the fact that it was the hundredth
anniversary of Voltaires death that served so to speak as an excuse
for the publication of the book as early as  For Voltaire as the
opposite of every one who wrote after him was above all a grandee of
the intellect precisely what I am also The name of Voltaire on one
of my writingsthat was verily a step forwardin my direction
Looking into this book a little more closely you perceive a pitiless
spirit who knows all the secret hidingplaces in which ideals are wont
to skulkwhere they find their dungeons and as it were their last
refuge With a torch in my hand the light of which is not by any
means a flickering one I illuminate this nether world with beams that
cut like blades It is war but war without powder and smoke without
warlike attitudes without pathos and contorted limbsall these things
would still be idealism One error after the other is quietly laid
upon ice the ideal is not refutedit freezes Here for instance
genius freezes round the corner the saint freezes under a thick
icicle the hero freezes and in the end faith itself freezes
Socalled conviction and also pity are considerably cooledand
almost everywhere the thing in itself is freezing to death






This book was begun during the first musical festival at Bayreuth a
feeling of profound strangeness towards everything that surrounded
me there is one of its first conditions He who has any notion of
the visions which even at that time had flitted across my path will
be able to guess what I felt when one day I came to my senses in
Bayreuth It was just as if I had been dreaming Where on earth was I
I recognised nothing that I saw I scarcely recognised Wagner It was
in vain that I called up reminiscences Tribschenremote island of
bliss not the shadow of a resemblance The incomparable days devoted
to the laying of the first stone the small group of the initiated
who celebrated them and who were far from lacking fingers for the
handling of delicate things not the shadow of a resemblance What
had happenedWagner had been translated into German The Wagnerite
had become master of WagnerGerman art the German master German
beer We who know only too well the kind of refined artists and
cosmopolitanism in taste to which alone Wagners art can appeal were
beside ourselves at the sight of Wagner bedecked with German virtues
I think I know the Wagnerite I have experienced three generations
of them from Brendel of blessed memory who confounded Wagner with
Hegel to the idealists of the Bayreuth Gazette who confound
Wagner with themselvesI have been the recipient of every kind of
confession about Wagner from beautiful souls My kingdom for just
one intelligent word IIn very truth a bloodcurdling company Nohl
Pohl and Kohl and others of their kidney to infinity There
was not a single abortion that was lacking among themno not even
the antiSemitePoor Wagner Into whose hands had he fallen If
only he had gone into a herd of swine But among Germans Some day
for the edification of posterity one ought really to have a genuine
Bayreuthian stuffed or better still preserved in spiritfor
it is precisely spirit that is lacking in this quarterwith this
inscription at the foot of the jar A sample of the spirit whereon
the German Empire was founded  But enough In the middle of
the festivities I suddenly packed my trunk and left the place for a
few weeks despite the fact that a charming Parisian lady sought to
comfort me I excused myself to Wagner simply by means of a fatalistic
telegram In a little spot called Klingenbrunn deeply buried in the
recesses of the Bohmerwald I carried my melancholy and my contempt of
Germans about with me like an illnessand from time to time under
the general title of The Ploughshare I wrote a sentence or two down
in my notebook nothing but severe psychological stuff which it is
possible may have found its way into Human alltooHuman






That which had taken place in me then was not only a breach with
WagnerI was suffering from a general aberration of my instincts
of which a mere isolated blunder whether it were Wagner or my
professorship at Ble was nothing more than a symptom I was seized
with a fit of impatience with myself I saw that it was high time that
I should turn my thoughts upon my own lot In a trice I realised with
appalling clearness how much time had already been squanderedhow
futile and how senseless my whole existence as a philologist appeared
by the side of my lifetask I was ashamed of this false modesty
Ten years were behind me during which to tell the truth the
nourishment of my spirit had been at a standstill during which I had
added not a single useful fragment to my knowledge and had forgotten
countless things in the pursuit of a hotchpotch of dryasdust
scholarship To crawl with meticulous care and shortsighted eyes
through old Greek metriciansthat is what I had come to Moved to
pity I saw myself quite thin quite emaciated realities were only too
plainly absent from my stock of knowledge and what the idealities
were worth the devil alone knew A positively burning thirst overcame
me and from that time forward I have done literally nothing else than
study physiology medicine and natural scienceI even returned to
the actual study of history only when my lifetask compelled me to It
was at that time too that I first divined the relation between an
instinctively repulsive occupation a socalled vocation which is the
last thing to which one is called and that need of lulling a feeling
of emptiness and hunger by means of an art which is a narcoticby
means of Wagners art for instance After looking carefully about
me I have discovered that a large number of young men are all in the
same state of distress one kind of unnatural practice perforce leads
to another In Germany or rather to avoid all ambiguity in the
Empire only too many are condemned to determine their choice too
soon and then to pine away beneath a burden that they can no longer
throw off Such creatures crave for Wagner as for an opiatethey
are thus able to forget themselves to be rid of themselves for a
moment What am I sayingfor five or six hours






At this time my instincts turned resolutely against any further
yielding or following on my part and any further misunderstanding
of myself Every kind of life the most unfavourable circumstances
illness povertyanything seemed to me preferable to that undignified
selfishness into which I had fallen in the first place thanks to my
ignorance and youth and in which I had afterwards remained owing to
lazinessthe socalled sense of duty At this juncture there came to
my help in a way that I cannot sufficiently admire and precisely at
the right time that evil heritage which I derive from my fathers side
of the family and which at bottom is no more than a predisposition
to die young Illness slowly liberated me from the toils it spared me
any sort of sudden breach any sort of violent and offensive step At
that time I lost not a particle of the good will of others but rather
added to my store Illness likewise gave me the right completely to
reverse my mode of life it not only allowed it actually commanded
me to forget it bestowed upon me the necessity of lying still of
having leisure of waiting and of exercising patience But all
this means thinking The state of my eyes alone put an end to all
bookwormishness or in plain Englishphilology I was thus delivered
from books for years I ceased from reading and this was the greatest
boon I ever conferred upon myself That nethermost self which was
as it were entombed and which had grown dumb because it had been
forced to listen perpetually to other selves for that is what reading
means slowly awakened at first it was shy and doubtful but at
last it spoke again Never have I rejoiced more over my condition
than during the sickest and most painful moments of my life You have
only to examine The Dawn of Day or perhaps The Wanderer and
his Shadow in order to understand what this return to myself
actually meant in itself it was the highest kind of recovery My
cure was simply the result of it






Human alltooHuman this monument of a course of vigorous
selfdiscipline by means of which I put an abrupt end to all the
Superior Bunkum Idealism Beautiful Feelings and other
effeminacies that had percolated into my being was written principally
in Sorrento it was finished and given definite shape during a winter
at Ble under conditions far less favourable than those in Sorrento
Truth to tell it was Peter Gast at that time a student at the
University of Ble and a devoted friend of mine who was responsible
for the book With my head wrapped in bandages and extremely painful
I dictated while he wrote and corrected as he went alongto be
accurate he was the real composer whereas I was only the author
When the completed book ultimately reached meto the great surprise
of the serious invalid I then wasI sent among others two copies
to Bayreuth Thanks to a miraculous flash of intelligence on the part
of chance there reached me precisely at the same time a splendid copy
of the Parsifal text with the following inscription from Wagners
pen To his dear friend Friedrich Nietzsche from Richard Wagner
Ecclesiastical Councillor At this crossing of the two books I seemed
to hear an ominous note Did it not sound as if two swords had crossed
At all events we both felt this was so for each of us remained silent
At about this time the first Bayreuth Pamphlets appeared and I then
understood the move on my part for which it was high time Incredible
Wagner had become pious






My attitude to myself at that time  and the unearthly certitude
with which I grasped my lifetask and all its worldhistoric
consequences is well revealed throughout the book but more
particularly in one very significant passage despite the fact that
with my instinctive cunning I once more circumvented the use of
the little word Inot however this time in order to shed
worldhistoric glory on the names of Schopenhauer and Wagner but on
that of another of my friends the excellent Dr Paul Refortunately
much too acute a creature to be deceivedothers were less subtle
Among my readers I have a number of hopeless people the typical
German professor for instance who can always be recognised from the
fact that judging from the passage in question he feels compelled to
regard the whole book as a sort of superior Realism As a matter of
fact it contradicts five or six of my friends utterances only read
the introduction to The Genealogy of Morals on this questionThe
passage above referred to reads What after all is the principal
axiom to which the boldest and coldest thinker the author of the
book On the Origin of Moral Sensations read Nietzsche the first
Immoralist has attained by means of his incisive and decisive
analysis of human actions The moral man he says is no nearer to the
intelligible metaphysical world than is the physical man for there
is no intelligible world This theory hardened and sharpened under
the hammerblow of historical knowledge read The Transvaluation
of all Values may some time or other perhaps in some future
periodserve as the axe which is applied to the root of the
metaphysical need of manwhether more as a blessing than a curse to
the general welfare it is not easy to say but in any case as a theory
with the most important consequences at once fruitful and terrible
and looking into the world with that Janusface which all great
knowledge possesses

THE DAWN OF DAY

THOUGHTS ABOUT MORALITY AS A PREJUDICE






With this book I open my campaign against morality Not that it is at
all redolent of powderyou will find quite other and much nicer smells
in it provided that you have any keenness in your nostrils There
is nothing either of light or of heavy artillery in its composition
and if its general end be a negative one its means are not someans
out of which the end follows like a logical conclusion not like a
cannonshot And if the reader takes leave of this book with a feeling
of timid caution in regard to everything which has hitherto been
honoured and even worshipped under the name of morality it does not
alter the fact that there is not one negative word not one attack
and not one single piece of malice in the whole workon the contrary
it lies in the sunshine smooth and happy like a marine animal
basking in the sun between two rocks For after all I was this marine
animal almost every sentence in the book was thought out or rather
caught among that medley of rocks in the neighbourhood of Genoa
where I lived quite alone and exchanged secrets with the ocean Even
to this day when by chance I happen to turn over the leaves of this
book almost every sentence seems to me like a hook by means of which I
draw something incomparable out of the depths its whole skin quivers
with delicate shudders of recollection This book is conspicuous for no
little art in gently catching things which whisk rapidly and silently
away moments which I call godlike lizardsnot with the cruelty of
that young Greek god who simply transfixed the poor little beast
but nevertheless with something pointedwith a pen There are so
many dawns which have not yet shed their lightthis Indian maxim is
written over the doorway of this book Where does its author seek that
new morning that delicate red as yet undiscovered with which another
dayah a whole series of days a whole world of new dayswill
begin In the Transvaluation of all Values in an emancipation from
all moral values in a saying of yea and in an attitude of trust to
all that which hitherto has been forbidden despised and damned This
yeasaying book projects its light its love its tenderness over all
evil things it restores to them their soul their clear conscience
and their superior right and privilege to exist on earth Morality is

My lifetask is to prepare for humanity one supreme moment in which it
can come to its senses a Great Noon in which it will turn its gaze
backwards and forwards in which it will step from under the yoke
of accident and of priests and for the first time set the question
of the Why and Wherefore of humanity as a wholethis lifetask
naturally follows out of the conviction that mankind does not get
on the right road of its own accord that it is by no means divinely
ruled but rather that it is precisely under the cover of its most
holy valuations that the instinct of negation of corruption and of
degeneration has held such a seductive sway The question concerning
the origin of moral valuations is therefore a matter of the highest
importance to me because it determines the future of mankind The
demand made upon us to believe that everything is really in the best
hands that a certain book the Bible gives us the definite and
comforting assurance that there is a Providence that wisely rules the
fate of manwhen translated back into reality amounts simply to this
namely the will to stifle the truth which maintains the reverse of
all this which is that hitherto man has been in the worst possible
hands and that he has been governed by the physiologically botched
the men of cunning and burning revengefulness and the socalled
saintsthose slanderers of the world and traducers of humanity
The definite proof of the fact that the priest including the priest
in disguise the philosopher has become master not only within a
certain limited religious community but everywhere and that the
morality of decadence the will to nonentity has become morality
per se is to be found in this that altruism is now an absolute
value and egoism is regarded with hostility everywhere He who
disagrees with me on this point I regard as infected But all the
world disagrees with me To a physiologist a like antagonism between
values admits of no doubt If the most insignificant organ within the
body neglects however slightly to assert with absolute certainty its
selfpreservative powers its recuperative claims and its egoism the
whole system degenerates The physiologist insists upon the removal of
degenerated parts he denies all fellowfeeling for such parts and
has not the smallest feeling of pity for them But the desire of the
priest is precisely the degeneration of the whole of mankind hence his
preservation of that which is degeneratethis is what his dominion
costs humanity What meaning have those lying concepts those handmaids
of morality Soul Spirit Free will God if their aim is not
the physiological ruin of mankind When earnestness is diverted from
the instincts that aim at selfpreservation and an increase of bodily
energy ie at an increase of life when anmia is raised to an
ideal and the contempt of the body is construed as the salvation of
the soul what is all this if it is not a recipe for decadence Loss
of ballast resistance offered to natural instincts selflessness
in factthis is what has hitherto been known as morality With The
Dawn of Day I first engaged in a struggle against the morality of
selfrenunciation




JOYFUL WISDOM LA GAYA SCIENZA






Dawn of Day is a yeasaying book profound but clear and kindly The
same applies once more and in the highest degree to La Gaya Scienza
in almost every sentence of this book profundity and playfulness go
gently hand in hand A verse which expresses my gratitude for the most
wonderful month of January which I have ever livedthe whole book is a
giftsufficiently reveals the abysmal depths from which wisdom has
here become joyful

    Thou who with cleaving fiery lances
    The stream of my soul from its ice dost free
    Till with a rush and a roar it advances
    To enter with glorious hoping the sea
    Brighter to see and purer ever
    Free in the bonds of thy sweet constraint
    So it praises thy wondrous endeavour
    January thou beauteous saint

Who can be in any doubt as to what glorious hoping means here when
he has realised the diamond beauty of the first of Zarathustras
words as they appear in a glow of light at the close of the fourth
book Or when he reads the granite sentences at the end of the third
book wherein a fate for all times is first given a formula The songs
of Prince FreeasaBird which for the most part were written in
Sicily remind me quite forcibly of that Provencal notion of Gaya
Scienza of that union of singer knight and free spirit which
distinguishes that wonderfully early culture of the Provencals from
all ambiguous cultures The last poem of all To the Mistralan
exuberant dance song in which if you please the new spirit dances
freely upon the corpse of moralityis a perfect Provenalism

THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA A BOOK FOR ALL AND NONE






I now wish to relate the history of Zarathustra The fundamental
idea of the work the Eternal Recurrence the highest formula of
a Yeasaying to life that can ever be attained was first conceived
in the month of August  I made a note of the idea on a sheet of
paper with the postscript Six thousand feet beyond man and time
That day I happened to be wandering through the woods alongside of the
Lake of Silvaplana and I halted not far from Surlei beside a huge
rock that towered aloft like a pyramid It was then that the thought
struck me Looking back now I find that exactly two months before
this inspiration I had an omen of its coming in the form of a sudden
and decisive change in my tastesmore particularly in music The
whole of Zarathustra might perhaps be classified under the rubric
music At all events the essential condition of its production was
a second birth within me of the art of hearing In Recoaro a small
mountain resort near Vicenza where I spent the spring of  I and
my friend and maestro Peter Gastwho was also one who had been born
again discovered that the phnix music hovered over us in lighter
and brighter plumage than it had ever worn before If therefore I
now calculate from that day forward the sudden production of the book
under the most unlikely circumstances in February the last
part out of which I quoted a few lines in my preface was written
precisely in the hallowed hour when Richard Wagner gave up the ghost
in VeniceI come to the conclusion that the period of gestation
covered eighteen months This period of exactly eighteen months
might suggest at least to Buddhists that I am in reality a female
elephant The interval was devoted to the Gaya Scienza which contains
hundreds of indications of the proximity of something unparalleled
for after all it shows the beginning of Zarathustra since it
presents Zarathustras fundamental thought in the last aphorism
but one of the fourth book To this interval also belongs that Hymn
to Life for a mixed choir and orchestra the score of which was
published in Leipzig two years ago by E W Fritsch and which gave
perhaps no slight indication of my spiritual state during this year
in which the essentially yeasaying pathos which I call the tragic
pathos completely filled me heart and limb One day people will sing
it to my memory The text let it be well understood as there is
some misunderstanding abroad on this point is not by me it was the
astounding inspiration of a young Russian lady Miss Lou von Salome
with whom I was then on friendly terms He who is in any way able
to make some sense of the last words of the poem will divine why I
preferred and admired it there is greatness in them Pain is not
regarded as an objection to existence And if thou hast no bliss now
left to crown meLead on Thou hast thy Sorrow still

Maybe that my music is also great in this passage The last note of
the oboe by the bye is C sharp not C The latter is a misprint
During the following winter I was living on that charmingly peaceful
Gulf of Rapallo not far from Genoa which cuts inland between Chiavari
and Cape Porto Fino My health was not very good the winter was cold
and exceptionally rainy and the small albergo in which I lived
was so close to the water that at night my sleep was disturbed if
the sea was rough These circumstances were surely the very reverse
of favourable and yet in spite of it all and as if in proof of my
belief that everything decisive comes to life in defiance of every
obstacle it was precisely during this winter and in the midst of these
unfavourable circumstances that my Zarathustra originated In the
morning I used to start out in a southerly direction up the glorious
road to Zoagli which rises up through a forest of pines and gives
one a view far out to sea In the afternoon or as often as my health
allowed I walked round the whole bay from Santa Margherita to beyond
Porto Fino This spot affected me all the more deeply because it was
so dearly loved by the Emperor Frederick III In the autumn of  I
chanced to be there again when he was revisiting this small forgotten
world of happiness for the last time It was on these two roads that
all Zarathustra came to me above all Zarathustra himself as a
typeI ought rather to say that it was on these walks that he waylaid
me






In order to understand this type you must first be quite clear
concerning its fundamental physiological condition this condition
is what I call great healthiness In regard to this idea I cannot
make my meaning more plain or more personal than I have done already
in one of the last aphorisms No  of the fifth book of the Gaya
Scienza We new nameless and unfathomable creatures so reads
the passage we firstlings of a future still unprovedwe who have a
new end in view also require new means to that end that is to say
a new healthiness a stronger keener tougher bolder and merrier
healthiness than any that has existed heretofore He who longs to
feel in his own soul the whole range of values and aims that have
prevailed on earth until his day and to sail round all the coasts
of this ideal Mediterranean Sea who from the adventures of his
own inmost experience would fain know how it feels to be a conqueror
and discoverer of the idealas also how it is with the artist the
saint the legislator the sage the scholar the man of piety and the
godlike anchorite of yoresuch a man requires one thing above all
for his purpose and that is great healthinesssuch healthiness as
he not only possesses but also constantly acquires and must acquire
because he is continually sacrificing it again and is compelled to
sacrifice it And now therefore after having been long on the way
we Argonauts of the ideal whose pluck is greater than prudence would
allow and who are often shipwrecked and bruised but as I have said
healthier than people would like to admit dangerously healthy and for
ever recovering our healthit would seem as if we had before us as
a reward for all our toils a country still undiscovered the horizon
of which no one has yet seen a beyond to every country and every
refuge of the ideal that man has ever known a world so overflowing
with beauty strangeness doubt terror and divinity that both our
curiosity and our lust of possession are frantic with eagerness Alas
how in the face of such vistas and with such burning desire in our
conscience and consciousness could we still be content with the man
of the present day This is bad indeed but that we should regard
his worthiest aims and hopes with illconcealed amusement or perhaps
give them no thought at all is inevitable Another ideal now leads
us on a wonderful seductive ideal full of danger the pursuit of
which we should be loath to urge upon any one because we are not so
ready to acknowledge any ones right to it the ideal of a spirit who
plays ingenuously that is to say involuntarily and as the outcome
of superabundant energy and power with everything that hitherto
has been called holy good inviolable and divine to whom even the
loftiest thing that the people have with reason made their measure of
value would be no better than a danger a decay and an abasement or
at least a relaxation and temporary forgetfulness of self the ideal
of a humanly superhuman wellbeing and goodwill which often enough
will seem inhumanas when for instance it stands beside all past
earnestness on earth and all past solemnities in hearing speech
tone look morality and duty as their most lifelike and unconscious
parodybut with which nevertheless great earnestness perhaps alone
begins the first note of interrogation is affixed the fate of the
soul changes the hour hand moves and tragedy begins






Has any one at the end of the nineteenth century any distinct notion
of what poets of a stronger age understood by the word inspiration
If not I will describe it If one had the smallest vestige of
superstition left in one it would hardly be possible completely to
set aside the idea that one is the mere incarnation mouthpiece or
medium of an almighty power The idea of revelation in the sense
that something which profoundly convulses and upsets one becomes
suddenly visible and audible with indescribable certainty and
accuracydescribes the simple fact One hearsone does not seek one
takesone does not ask who gives a thought suddenly flashes up like
lightning it comes with necessity without falteringI have never had
any choice in the matter There is an ecstasy so great that the immense
strain of it is sometimes relaxed by a flood of tears during which
ones steps now involuntarily rush and anon involuntarily lag There
is the feeling that one is utterly out of hand with the very distinct
consciousness of an endless number of fine thrills and titillations
descending to ones very toesthere is a depth of happiness in which
the most painful and gloomy parts do not act as antitheses to the rest
but are produced and required as necessary shades of colour in such an
overflow of light There is an instinct for rhythmic relations which
embraces a whole world of forms length the need of a wideembracing
rhythm is almost the measure of the force of an inspiration a sort
of counterpart to its pressure and tension Everything happens
quite involuntarily as if in a tempestuous outburst of freedom
of absoluteness of power and divinity The involuntary nature of
the figures and similes is the most remarkable thing one loses all
perception of what is imagery and metaphor everything seems to present
itself as the readiest the truest and simplest means of expression
It actually seems to use one of Zarathustras own phrases as if all
things came to one and offered themselves as similes Here do all
things come caressingly to thy discourse and flatter thee for they
would fain ride upon thy back On every simile thou ridest here unto
every truth Here fly open unto thee all the speech and word shrines
of the world here would all existence become speech here would
all Becoming learn of thee how to speak This is my experience of
inspiration I do not doubt but that I should have to go back thousands
of years before I could find another who could say to me It is mine
also






For a few weeks afterwards I lay an invalid in Genoa Then followed
a melancholy spring in Rome where I only just managed to liveand
this was no easy matter This city which is absolutely unsuited to
the poetauthor of Zarathustra and for the choice of which I was
not responsible made me inordinately miserable I tried to leave it
I wanted to go to Aquilathe opposite of Rome in every respect and
actually founded in a spirit of hostility towards that city just as
I also shall found a city some day as a memento of an atheist and
genuine enemy of the Church a person very closely related to me the
great Hohenstaufen the Emperor Frederick II But Fate lay behind it
all I had to return again to Rome In the end I was obliged to be
satisfied with the Piazza Barberini after I had exerted myself in
vain to find an antiChristian quarter I fear that on one occasion
to avoid bad smells as much as possible I actually inquired at the
Palazzo del Quirinale whether they could not provide a quiet room for
a philosopher In a chamber high above the Piazza just mentioned from
which one obtained a general view of Rome and could hear the fountains
plashing far below the loneliest of all songs was composedThe
NightSong About this time I was obsessed by an unspeakably sad
melody the refrain of which I recognised in the affords dead through
immortality  In the summer finding myself once more in the sacred
place where the first thought of Zarathustra flashed like a light
across my mind I conceived the second part Ten days sufficed Neither
for the second the first nor the third part have I required a day
longer In the ensuing winter beneath the halcyon sky of Nice which
then for the first time poured its light into my life I found the
third Zarathustraand came to the end of my task the whole having
occupied me scarcely a year Many hidden corners and heights in the
country round about Nice are hallowed for me by moments that I can
never forget That decisive chapter entitled Old and New Tables
was composed during the arduous ascent from the station to Ezathat
wonderful Moorish village in the rocks During those moments when my
creative energy flowed most plentifully my muscular activity was
always greatest The body is inspired let us waive the question of
soul I might often have been seen dancing in those days and I could
then walk for seven or eight hours on end over the hills without a
suggestion of fatigue I slept well and laughed a good dealI was
perfectly robust and patient






With the exception of these periods of industry lasting ten days the
years I spent during the production of Zarathustra and thereafter
were for me years of unparalleled distress A man pays dearly for
being immortal to this end he must die many times over during his
life There is such a thing as what I call the rancour of greatness
everything great whether a work or a deed once it is completed turns
immediately against its author The very fact that he is its author
makes him weak at this time He can no longer endure his deed He can
no longer look it full in the face To have something at ones back
which one could never have willed something to which the knot of human
destiny is attachedand to be forced thenceforward to bear it on ones
shoulders Why it almost crushes one The rancour of greatness A
somewhat different experience is the uncanny silence that reigns about
one Solitude has seven skins which nothing can penetrate One goes
among men one greets friends but these things are only new deserts
the looks of those one meets no longer bear a greeting At the best
one encounters a sort of revolt This feeling of revolt I suffered
in varying degrees of intensity at the hands of almost every one who
came near me it would seem that nothing inflicts a deeper wound than
suddenly to make ones distance felt Those noble natures are scarce
who know not how to live unless they can revere A third thing is
the absurd susceptibility of the skin to small pinpricks a kind of
helplessness in the presence of all small things This seems to me a
necessary outcome of the appalling expenditure of all defensive forces
which is the first condition of every creative act of every act
which proceeds from the most intimate most secret and most concealed
recesses of a mans being The small defensive forces are thus as it
were suspended and no fresh energy reaches them I even think it
probable that one does not digest so well that one is less willing
to move and that one is much too open to sensations of coldness and
suspicion for in a large number of cases suspicion is merely a
blunder in etiology On one occasion when I felt like this I became
conscious of the proximity of a herd of cows some time before I could
possibly have seen it with my eyes simply owing to a return in me of
milder and more humane sentiments they communicated warmth to me






This work stands alone Do not let us mention the poets in the
same breath nothing perhaps has ever been produced out of such a
superabundance of strength My concept Dionysian here became the
highest deed compared with it everything that other men have done
seems poor and limited The fact that a Goethe or a Shakespeare would
not for an instant have known how to take breath in this atmosphere of
passion and of the heights the fact that by the side of Zarathustra
Dante is no more than a believer and not one who first creates the
truththat is to say not a worldruling spirit a Fate the fact
that the poets of the Veda were priests and not even fit to unfasten
Zarathustras sandalall this is the least of things and gives no
idea of the distance of the azure solitude in which this work dwells
Zarathustra has an eternal right to say I draw around me circles and
holy boundaries Ever fewer are they that mount with me to ever loftier
heights I build me a mountain range of ever holier mountains If all
the spirit and goodness of every great soul were collected together
the whole could not create a single one of Zarathustras discourses
The ladder upon which he rises and descends is of boundless length
he has seen further he has willed further and gone further than
any other man There is contradiction in every word that he utters
this most yeasaying of all spirits Through him all contradictions
are bound up into a new unity The loftiest and the basest powers of
human nature the sweetest the lightest and the most terrible rush
forth from out one spring with everlasting certainty Until his coming
no one knew what was height or depth and still less what was truth
There is not a single passage in this revelation of truth which had
already been anticipated and divined by even the greatest among men
Before Zarathustra there was no wisdom no probing of the soul no art
of speech in his book the most familiar and most vulgar thing utters
unheardof words The sentence quivers with passion Eloquence has
become music Forks of lightning are hurled towards futures of which
no one has ever dreamed before The most powerful use of parables that
has yet existed is poor beside it and mere childsplay compared with
this return of language to the nature of imagery See how Zarathustra
goes down from the mountain and speaks the kindest words to every
one See with what delicate fingers he touches his very adversaries
the priests and how he suffers with them from themselves Here at
every moment man is overcome and the concept Superman becomes the
greatest realityout of sight almost far away beneath him lies
all that which heretofore has been called great in man The halcyonic
brightness the light feet the presence of wickedness and exuberance
throughout and all that is the essence of the type Zarathustra was
never dreamt of before as a prerequisite of greatness In precisely
these limits of space and in this accessibility to opposites
Zarathustra feels himself the highest of all living things and when
you hear how he defines this highest you will give up trying to find
his equal

The soul which hath the longest ladder and can step down deepest

The vastest soul that can run and stray and rove furthest in its own
domain

The most necessary soul that out of desire flingeth itself to chance

The stable soul that plungeth into Becoming the possessing soul that
must needs taste of willing and longing

The soul that flyeth from itself and overtaketh itself in the widest
circle

The wisest soul that folly exhorteth most sweetly

The most selfloving soul in whom all things have their rise their
ebb and flow

But this is the very idea of Dionysus Another consideration leads
to this idea The psychological problem presented by the type of
Zarathustra is how can he who in an unprecedented manner says
no and acts no in regard to all that which has been affirmed
hitherto remain nevertheless a yeasaying spirit how can he who
bears the heaviest destiny on his shoulders and whose very lifetask
is a fatality yet be the brightest and the most transcendental
of spiritsfor Zarathustra is a dancer how can he who has the
hardest and most terrible grasp of reality and who has thought the
most abysmal thoughts nevertheless avoid conceiving these things
as objections to existence or even as objections to the eternal
recurrence of existencehow is it that on the contrary he finds
reasons for being himself the eternal affirmation of all things the
tremendous and unlimited saying of Yea and Amen Into every abyss
do I bear the benediction of my yea to Life  But this once more
is precisely the idea of Dionysus






What language will such a spirit speak when he speaks unto his soul
The language of the dithyramb I am the inventor of the dithyramb
Hearken unto the manner in which Zarathustra speaks to his soul Before
Sunrise iii  Before my time such emerald joys and divine
tenderness had found no tongue Even the profoundest melancholy of
such a Dionysus takes shape as a dithyramb As an example of this I
take The NightSongthe immortal plaint of one who thanks to his
superabundance of light and power thanks to the sun within him is
condemned never to love

It is night now do all gushing springs raise their voices And my
soul too is a gushing spring

It is night now only do all lovers burst into song And my soul too
is the song of a lover

Something unquenched and unquenchable is within me that would raise
its voice A craving for love is within me which itself speaketh the
language of love

Light am I would that I were night But this is my loneliness that I
am begirt with light

Alas why am I not dark and like unto the night How joyfully would I
then suck at the breasts of light

And even you would I bless ye twinkling starlets and glowworms on
high and be blessed in the gifts of your light

But in mine own light do I live ever back into myself do I drink the
flames I send forth

I know not the happiness of the hand stretched forth to grasp and oft
have I dreamt that stealing must be more blessed than taking

Wretched am I that my hand may never rest from giving an envious fate
is mine that I see expectant eyes and nights made bright with longing

Oh the wretchedness of all them that give Oh the clouds that cover
the face of my sun That craving for desire that burning hunger at the
end of the feast

They take what I give them but do I touch their soul A gulf is there
twixt giving and taking and the smallest gulf is the last to be
bridged

An appetite is born from out my beauty would that I might do harm to
them that I fill with light would that I might rob them of the gifts I
have giventhus do I thirst for wickedness

To withdraw my hand when their hand is ready stretched forth like the
waterfall that wavers wavers even in its fallthus do I thirst for
wickedness

For such vengeance doth my fulness yearn to such tricks doth my
loneliness give birth

My joy in giving died with the deed By its very fulness did my virtue
grow weary of itself

He who giveth risketh to lose his shame he that is ever distributing
groweth callous in hand and heart therefrom

Mine eyes no longer melt into tears at the sight of the suppliants
shame my hand hath become too hard to feel the quivering of laden
hands

Whither have ye fled the tears of mine eyes and the bloom of my
heart Oh the solitude of all givers Oh the silence of all beacons

Many are the suns that circle in barren space to all that is dark do
they speak with their lightto me alone are they silent

Alas this is the hatred of light for that which shineth pitiless it
runneth its course

Unfair in its inmost heart to that which shineth cold toward
sunsthus doth every sun go its way

Like a tempest do the suns fly over their course for such is their
way Their own unswerving will do they follow that is their coldness

Alas it is ye alone ye creatures of gloom ye spirits of the night
that take your warmth from that which shineth Ye alone suck your milk
and comfort from the udders of light

Alas about me there is ice my hand burneth itself against ice

Alas within me is a thirst that thirsteth for your thirst

It is night woe is me that I must needs be light And thirst after
darkness And loneliness

It is night now doth my longing burst forth like a springfor
speech do I long

It is night now do all gushing springs raise their voices And my
soul too is a gushing spring

It is night now only do all lovers burst into song And my soul too
is the song of a lover






Such things have never been written never been felt never been
suffered only a God only Dionysus suffers in this way The reply
to such a dithyramb on the suns solitude in light would be Ariadne
 Who knows but I who Ariadne is To all such riddles no one
heretofore had ever found an answer I doubt even whether any one had
ever seen a riddle here One day Zarathustra severely determines his
lifetaskand it is also mine Let no one misunderstand its meaning
Its a yeasaying to the point of justifying to the point of redeeming
even all that is past

I walk among men as among fragments of the future of that future
which I see

And all my creativeness and effort is but this that I may be able to
think and recast all these fragments and riddles and dismal accidents
into one piece

And how could I bear to be a man if man were not also a poet a
riddle reader and a redeemer of chance

To redeem all the past and to transform every it was into thus
would I have itthat alone would be my salvation

In another passage he defines as strictly as possible what to him alone
man can benot a subject for love nor yet for pityZarathustra
became master even of his loathing of man man is to him a thing
unshaped raw material an ugly stone that needs the sculptors chisel

No longer to will no longer to value no longer to create Oh that
this great weariness may never be mine

Even in the lust of knowledge I feel only the joy of my will to beget
and to grow and if there be innocence in my knowledge it is because
my procreative will is in it

Away from God and gods did this will lure me what would there be to
create if there were gods

But to man doth it ever drive me anew my burning creative will
Thus driveth it the hammer to the stone

Alas ye men within the stone there sleepeth an image for me the
image of all my dreams Alas that it should have to sleep in the
hardest and ugliest stone

Now rageth my hammer ruthlessly against its prison From the stone
the fragments fly whats that to me

I will finish it for a shadow came unto methe stillest and lightest
thing on earth once came unto me

The beauty of the Superman came unto me as a shadow Alas my
brethren What are thegods to me now

Let me call attention to one last point of view The line in italics is
my pretext for this remark A Dionysian lifetask needs the hardness of
the hammer and one of its first essentials is without doubt the joy
even of destruction The command Harden yourselves and the deep
conviction that all creators are hard is the really distinctive sign
of a Dionysian nature




BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL


THE PRELUDE TO A PHILOSOPHY OF THE FUTURE






My work for the years that followed was prescribed as distinctly
as possible Now that the yeasaying part of my lifetask was
accomplished there came the turn of the negative portion both in
word and deed the transvaluation of all values that had existed
hitherto the great warthe conjuringup of the day when the fatal
outcome of the struggle would be decided Meanwhile I had slowly to
look about me for my peers for those who out of strength would
proffer me a helping hand in my work of destruction From that time
onward all my writings are so much bait maybe I understand as much
about fishing as most people If nothing was caught it was not I who
was at fault There were no fish to come and bite






In all its essential points this book  is a criticism of
modernity embracing the modern sciences arts even politics
together with certain indications as to a type which would be the
reverse of modern man or as little like him as possible a noble
and yeasaying type In this last respect the book is a school
for gentlementhe term gentleman being understood here in a
much more spiritual and radical sense than it has implied hitherto
All those things of which the age is proudas for instance
farfamed objectivity sympathy with all that suffers the
historical sense with its subjection to foreign tastes with its
lyinginthedust before petits faits and the rage for scienceare
shown to be the contradiction of the type recommended and are
regarded as almost illbred If you remember that this book follows
upon Zarathustra you may possibly guess to what system of diet it
owes its life The eye which owing to tremendous constraint has
become accustomed to see at a great distanceZarathustra is even
more farsighted than the Tsaris here forced to focus sharply that
which is close at hand the present time the things that lie about
him In all the aphorisms and more particularly in the form of this
book the reader will find the same voluntary turning away from those
instincts which made a Zarathustra a possible feat Refinement in
form in aspiration and in the art of keeping silent are its more or
less obvious qualities psychology is handled with deliberate hardness
and crueltythe whole book does not contain one single goodnatured
word All this sort of thing refreshes a man Who can guess the kind
of recreation that is necessary after such an expenditure of goodness
as is to be found in Zarathustra From a theological standpointnow
pay ye heed for it is but on rare occasions that I speak as a
theologianit was God Himself who at the end of His great work
coiled Himself up in the form of a serpent at the foot of the tree of
knowledge It was thus that He recovered from being a God He had
made everything too beautiful The devil is simply Gods moment of
idleness on that seventh day




THE GENEALOGY OF MORALS A POLEMIC


The three essays which constitute this genealogy are as regards
expression aspiration and the art of the unexpected perhaps the
most curious things that have ever been written Dionysus as you know
is also the god of darkness In each case the beginning is calculated
to mystify it is cool scientific even ironical intentionally
thrust to the fore intentionally reticent Gradually less calmness
prevails here and there a flash of lightning defines the horizon
exceedingly unpleasant truths break upon your ears from out remote
distances with a dull rumbling sounduntil very soon a fierce tempo
is attained in which everything presses forward at a terrible degree
of tension At the end in each case amid fearful thunderclaps a new
truth shines out between thick clouds The truth of the first essays
the psychology of Christianity the birth of Christianity out of the
spirit of resentment not as is supposed out of the Spiritin
all its essentials a countermovement the great insurrection against
the dominion of noble values The second essay contains the psychology
of conscience this is not as you may believe the voice of God in
man it is the instinct of cruelty which turns inwards once it is
unable to discharge itself outwardly Cruelty is here exposed for the
first time as one of the oldest and most indispensable elements in the
foundation of culture The third essay replies to the question as to
the origin of the formidable power of the ascetic ideal of the priest
ideal despite the fact that this ideal is essentially detrimental
that it is a will to nonentity and to decadence Reply it flourished
not because God was active behind the priests as is generally
believed but because it was a faute de mieuxfrom the fact that
hitherto it has been the only ideal and has had no competitors For
man prefers to aspire to nonentity than not to aspire at all But
above all until the time of Zarathustra there was no such thing

THE TWILIGHT OF THE IDOLS

HOW TO PHILOSOPHISE WITH THE HAMMER






This workwhich covers scarcely one hundred and fifty pages with its
cheerful and fateful tone like a laughing demon and the production
of which occupied so few days that I hesitate to give their numberis
altogether an exception among books there is no work more rich in
substance more independent more upsettingmore wicked If any one
should desire to obtain a rapid sketch of how everything before my
time was standing on its head he should begin reading me in this
book That which is called Idols on the title page is simply the
old truth that has been believed in hitherto In plain English The
Twilight of the Idols means that the old truth is on its last legs






There is no reality no ideality which has not been touched in
this book touched what a cautious euphemism Not only the eternal
idols but also the youngestthat is to say the most senile modern
ideas for instance A strong wind blows between the trees and in
all directions fall the fruitthe truths There is the waste of an
alltoorich autumn in this book you trip over truths You even crush
some to death there are too many of them Those things that you can
grasp however are quite unquestionable they are irrevocable decrees
I alone have the criterion of truths in my possession I alone can
decide It would seem as if a second consciousness had grown up in me
as if the lifewill in me had thrown a light upon the downward path
along which it has been running throughout the ages The downward
pathhitherto this had been called the road to Truth All obscure
impulsedarkness and dismayis at an end the good man was
precisely he who was least aware of the proper way And speaking
in all earnestness no one before me knew the proper way the way
upwards only after my time could men once more find hope lifetasks
and roads mapped out that lead to cultureI am the joyful harbinger
of this culture  On this account alone I am also a fatality






Immediately after the completion of the abovenamed work and without
letting even one day go by I tackled the formidable task of the
Transvaluation with a supreme feeling of pride which nothing could
equal and certain at each moment of my immortality I cut sign after
sign upon tablets of brass with the sureness of Fate The Preface
came into being on rd September  When after having written it
down I went out into the open that morning I was greeted by the most
beautiful day I had ever seen in the Upper Engadineclear glowing
with colour and presenting all the contrasts and all the intermediary
gradations between ice and the south I left SilsMaria only on the
th of September I had been forced to delay my departure owing to
floods and I was very soon and for some days the only visitor in
this wonderful spot on which my gratitude bestows the gift of an
immortal name After a journey that was full of incidents and not
without danger to lifeas for instance at Como which was flooded
when I reached it in the dead of nightI got to Turin on the
afternoon of the  st Turin is the only suitable place for me and
it shall be my home henceforward I took the same lodgings as I had
occupied in the spring  Via Carlo Alberto opposite the mighty
Palazzo Carignano in which Vittorio Emanuele was born and I had a
view of the Piazza Carlo Alberto and above it across to the hills
Without hesitating or allowing myself to be disturbed for a single
moment I returned to my work only the last quarter of which had still
to be written On the th September tremendous triumph the seventh
day the leisure of a god on the banks of the Po On the same day
I wrote the Preface to The Twilight of the Idols the correction of
the proofs of which provided me with recreation during the month of
September Never in my life have I experienced such an autumn nor
had I ever imagined that such things were possible on eartha Claude
Lorrain extended to infinity each day equal to the last in its wild

THE CASE OF WAGNER A MUSICIANS PROBLEM






In order to do justice to this essay a man ought to suffer from the
fate of music as from an open woundFrom what do I suffer when I
suffer from the fate of music From the fact that music has lost
its worldtransfiguring yeasaying characterthat it is decadent
music and no longer the flute of Dionysus Supposing however that
the fate of music be as dear to man as his own life because joy and
suffering are alike bound up with it then he will find this pamphlet
comparatively mild and full of consideration To be cheerful in
such circumstances and laugh goodnaturedly with others at ones
selfridendodicere severum when the verum dicere would
justify every sort of hardnessis humanity itself Who doubts that
I old artilleryman that I am would be able if I liked to point my
heavy guns at WagnerEverything decisive in this question I kept
to myselfI have loved WagnerAfter all an attack upon a more than
usually subtle unknown person whom another would not have divined
so easily lies in the meaning and path of my lifetask Oh I have
still quite a number of other unknown persons to unmask besides a
Cagliostro of Music Above all I have to direct an attack against
the German people who in matters of the spirit grow every day
more indolent poorer in instincts and more honest who with an
appetite for which they are to be envied continue to diet themselves
on contradictions and gulp down Faith in company with science
Christian love together with antiSemitism and the will to power to
the Empire dished up with the gospel of the humble without showing
the slightest signs of indigestion Fancy this absence of partyfeeling
in the presence of opposites Fancy this gastric neutrality and
disinterestedness Behold this sense of justice in the German palate
which can grant equal rights to allwhich finds everything tasteful
Without a shadow of a doubt the Germans are idealists When I was last
in Germany I found German taste striving to grant Wagner and the
Trumpeter of Sakkingen equal rights while I myself witnessed
the attempts of the people of Leipzig to do honour to one of the most
genuine and most German of musiciansusing German here in the old
sense of the worda man who was no mere German of the Empire the
master Heinrich Schtz by founding a Liszt Society the object of
which was to cultivate and spread artful listige Church music
Without a shadow of doubt the Germans are idealists






But here nothing shall stop me from being rude and from telling the
Germans one or two unpleasant home truths who else would do it if I
did not I refer to their laxity in matters historical Not only have
the Germans entirely lost the breadth of vision which enables one
to grasp the course of culture and the values of culture not only
are they one and all political or Church puppets but they have
also actually put a ban upon this very breadth of vision A man
must first and foremost be German he must belong to the race
then only can he pass judgment upon all values and lack of values
in historythen only can he establish them To be German is in
itself an argument Germany Germany above all is a principle
the Germans stand for the moral order of the universe in history
compared with the Roman Empire they are the upholders of freedom
compared with the eighteenth century they are the restorers of
morality of the Categorical Imperative There is such a thing as
the writing of history according to the lights of Imperial Germany
there is I fear antiSemitic historythere is also history written
with an eye to the Court and Herr von Treitschke is not ashamed
of himself Quite recently an idiotic opinion in historicis an
observation of Vischer the Swabian sthete since happily deceased
made the round of the German newspapers as a truth to which every
German must assent The observation was this The Renaissance and
the Reformation only together constitute a wholethe sthetic
rebirth and the moral rebirth When I listen to such things I lose
all patience and I feel inclined I even feel it my duty to tell the
Germans for once in a way all that they have on their conscience
Every great crime against culture for the last four centuries lies
on their conscience And always for the same reason always owing
to their bottomless cowardice in the face of reality which is also
cowardice in the face of truth always owing to the love of falsehood
which has become almost instinctive in themin short idealism
It was the Germans who caused Europe to lose the fruits the whole
meaning of her last period of greatnessthe period of the Renaissance
At a moment when a higher order of values values that were noble
that said yea to life and that guaranteed a future had succeeded
in triumphing over the opposite values the values of degeneration
in the very seat of Christianity itselfand even in the hearts of
those sitting thereLuther that cursed monk not only restored the
Church but what was a thousand times worse restored Christianity
and at a time too when it lay defeated Christianity the Denial of
the Will to Live exalted to a religion Luther was an impossible
monk who thanks to his own impossibility attacked the Church
and in so doing restored it Catholics would be perfectly justified
in celebrating feasts in honour of Luther and in producing festival
plays in his honour Luther and the rebirth of morality May all
psychology go to the devil Without a shadow of a doubt the Germans
are idealists On two occasions when at the cost of enormous courage
and selfcontrol an upright unequivocal and perfectly scientific
attitude of mind had been attained the Germans were able to discover
back stairs leading down to the old ideal again compromises between
truth and the ideal and in short formul for the right to reject
science and to perpetrate falsehoods Leibniz and Kantthese two
great breaks upon the intellectual honesty of Europe Finally at a
moment when there appeared on the bridge that spanned two centuries
of decadence a superior force of genius and will which was strong
enough to consolidate Europe and to convert it into a political and
economic unit with the object of ruling the world the Germans with
their Wars of Independence robbed Europe of the significancethe
marvellous significance of Napoleons life And in so doing they laid
on their conscience everything that followed everything that exists
todaythis sickliness and want of reason which is most opposed to
culture and which is called Nationalismthis nvrose nationale
from which Europe is suffering acutely this eternal subdivision of
Europe into petty states with politics on a municipal scale they have
robbed Europe itself of its significance of its reasonand have
stuffed it into a culdesac Is there any one except me who knows the
way out of this culdesac Does anyone except me know of an aspiration
which would be great enough to bind the people of Europe once more
together






And after all why should I not express my suspicions In my case
too the Germans will attempt to make a great fate give birth merely
to a mouse Up to the present they have compromised themselves with
me I doubt whether the future will improve them Alas how happy I
should be to prove a false prophet in this matter My natural readers
and listeners are already Russians Scandinavians and Frenchmenwill
they always be the same In the history of knowledge Germans are
represented only by doubtful names they have been able to produce only
unconscious swindlers this word applies to Fichte Schelling
Schopenhauer Hegel and Schleiermacher just as well as to Kant or
Leibniz they were all mere Schleiermachers The Germans must
not have the honour of seeing the first upright intellect in their
history of intellects that intellect in which truth ultimately got the
better of the fraud of four thousand years reckoned as one with the
German intellect German intellect is my foul air I breathe with
difficulty in the neighbourhood of this psychological uncleanliness
that has now become instinctivean uncleanliness which in every
word and expression betrays a German They have never undergone a
seventeenth century of hard selfexamination as the French havea
La Rochefoucauld a Descartes are a thousand times more upright
than the very first among Germansthe latter have not yet had any
psychologists But psychology is almost the standard of measurement
for the cleanliness or uncleanliness of a race For if a man is
not even clean how can he be deep The Germans are like women you
can scarcely ever I fathom their depthsthey havent any and thats
the end of it Thus they cannot even be called shallow That which is
called deep in Germany is precisely this instinctive uncleanliness
towards ones self of which I have just spoken people refuse to be
clear in regard to their own natures Might I be allowed perhaps to
suggest the word German as an international epithet denoting this
psychological depravityAt the moment of writing for instance the
German Emperor is declaring it to be his Christian duty to liberate
the slaves in Africa among us Europeans then this would be called
simply German  Have the Germans ever produced even a book that
had depth They are lacking in the mere idea of what constitutes a
book I have known scholars who thought that Kant was deep At the
Court of Prussia I fear that Herr von Treitschke is regarded as deep
And when I happen to praise Stendhal as a deep psychologist I have
often been compelled in the company of German University Professors
to spell his name aloud






And why should I not proceed to the end I am fond of clearing the
air It is even part of my ambition to be considered as essentially a
despiser of Germans I expressed my suspicions of the German character
even at the age of sixandtwenty see Thoughts out of Season
vol ii pp  to my mind the Germans are impossible
When I try to think of the kind of man who is opposed to me in all
my instincts my mental image takes the form of a German The first
thing I ask myself when I begin analysing a man is whether he has a
feeling for distance in him whether he sees rank gradation and order
everywhere between man and man whether he makes distinctions for
this is what constitutes a gentleman Otherwise he belongs hopelessly
to that openhearted openmindedalas and always very goodnatured
species la canaille But the Germans are canaillealas they are
so goodnatured A man lowers himself by frequenting the society of
Germans the German places every one on an equal footing With the
exception of my intercourse with one or two artists and above all
with Richard Wagner I cannot say that I have spent one pleasant hour
with Germans Suppose for one moment that the profoundest spirit
of all ages were to appear among Germans then one of the saviours
of the Capitol would be sure to arise and declare that his own ugly
soul was just as great I can no longer abide this race with which
a man is always in bad company which has no idea of nuanceswoe
to me I am a nuanceand which has not esprit in its feet and
cannot even walk withal In short the Germans have no feet at all
they simply have legs The Germans have not the faintest idea of how
vulgar they arebut this in itself is the acme of vulgaritythey are
not even ashamed of being merely Germans They will have their say in
everything they regard themselves as fit to decide all questions I
even fear that they have decided about me My whole life is essentially
a proof of this remark In vain have I sought among them for a sign of
tact and delicacy towards myself Among Jews I did indeed find it but
not among Germans I am so constituted as to be gentle and kindly to
every oneI have the right not to draw distinctionsbut this does
not prevent my eyes from being open I except no one and least of all
my friendsI only trust that this has not prejudiced my reputation
for humanity among them There are five or six things which I have
always made points of honour Albeit the truth remains that for many
years I have considered almost every letter that has reached me as a
piece of cynicism There is more cynicism in an attitude of goodwill
towards me than in any sort of hatred I tell every friend to his face
that he has never thought it worth his while to study any one of my
writings from the slightest hints I gather that they do not even know
what lies hidden in my books And with regard even to my Zarathustra
which of my friends would have seen more in it than a piece of
unwarrantable though fortunately harmless arrogance Ten years have
elapsed and no one has yet felt it a duty to his conscience to defend
my name against the absurd silence beneath which it has been entombed
It was a foreigner a Dane who first showed sufficient keenness of
instinct and of courage to do this and who protested indignantly
against my socalled friends At what German University today would
such lectures on my philosophy be possible as those which Dr Brandes
delivered last spring in Copenhagen thus proving once more his right
to the title psychologist For my part these things have never caused
me any pain that which is necessary does not offend me Amor fati
is the core of my nature This however does not alter the fact that
I love irony and even worldhistoric irony And thus about two years
before hurling the destructive thunderbolt of the Transvaluation
which will send the whole of civilisation into convulsions I sent
my Case of Wagner out into the world The Germans were given the
chance of blundering and immortalising their stupidity once more on my
account and they still have just enough time to do it in And have
they fallen in with my plans Admirably my dear Germans Allow me to
congratulate you

WHY I AM A FATALITY






I know my destiny There will come a day  when my name will recall
the memory of something formidablea crisis the like of which has
never been known on earth the memory of the most profound clash
of consciences and the passing of a sentence upon all that which
theretofore had been believed exacted and hallowed I am not a
man I am dynamite And with it all there is nought of the founder
of a religion in me Religions are matters for the mob after coming
in contact with a religious man I always feel that I must wash my
hands I require no believers it is my opinion that I am too
full of malice to believe even in myself I never address myself to
masses I am horribly frightened that one day I shall be pronounced
holy You will understand why I publish this book beforehandit is
to prevent people from wronging me I refuse to be a saint I would
rather be a clown Maybe I am a clown And I am notwithstanding or
rather not notwithstanding the mouthpiece of truth for nothing
more blownout with falsehood has ever existed than a saint But
my truth is terrible for hitherto lies have been called truth
The Transvaluation of all Values this is my formula for mankinds
greatest step towards coming to its sensesa step which in me became
flesh and genius My destiny ordained that I should be the first decent
human being and that I should feel myself opposed to the falsehood
of millenniums I was the first to discover truth and for the simple
reason that I was the first who became conscious of falsehood as
falsehoodthat is to say I smelt it as such My genius resides in
my nostrils I contradict as no one has contradicted hitherto and am
nevertheless the reverse of a negative spirit I am the harbinger of
joy the like of which has never existed before I have discovered
tasks of such lofty greatness that until my time no one had any idea
of such things Mankind can begin to have fresh hopes only now that I
have lived Thus I am necessarily a man of Fate For when Truth enters
the lists against the falsehood of ages shocks are bound to ensue
and a spell of earthquakes followed by the transposition of hills and
valleys such as the world has never yet imagined even in its dreams
The concept politics then becomes elevated entirely to the sphere
of spiritual warfare All the mighty realms of the ancient order of
society are blown into spacefor they are all based on falsehood
there will be wars the like of which have never been seen on earth
before Only from my time and after me will politics on a large scale
exist on earth






If you should require a formula for a destiny of this kind that has
taken human form you will find it in my Zarathustra

And he who would be a creator in good and evilverily he must first
be a destroyer and break values into pieces

Thus the greatest evil belongeth unto the greatest good but this is
the creative good

I am by far the most terrible man that has ever existed but this does
not alter the fact that I shall become the most beneficent I know the
joy of annihilation to a degree which is commensurate with my power
to annihilate In both cases I obey my Dionysian nature which knows
not how to separate the negative deed from the saying of yea I am the
first immoralist and in this sense I am essentially the annihilator






People have never asked me as they should have done what the name
of Zarathustra precisely meant in my mouth in the mouth of the
first immoralist for that which distinguishes this Persian from all
others in the past is the very fact that he was the exact reverse
of an immoralist Zarathustra was the first to see in the struggle
between good and evil the essential wheel in the working of things
The translation of morality into the realm of metaphysics as force
cause endinitself is his work But the very question suggests
its own answer Zarathustra created this most portentous of all
errorsmorality therefore he must be the first to expose it Not
only because he has had longer and greater experience of the subject
than any other thinkerall history is indeed the experimental
refutation of the theory of the socalled moral order of thingsbut
because of the more important fact that Zarathustra was the most
truthful of thinkers In his teaching alone is truthfulness upheld as
the highest virtuethat is to say as the reverse of the cowardice
of the idealist who takes to his heels at the sight of reality
Zarathustra has more pluck in his body than all other thinkers put
together To tell the truth and to aim straight that is the first
Persian virtue Have I made myself clear  The overcoming of
morality by itself through truthfulness the moralists overcoming of
himself in his oppositein methat is what the name Zarathustra means
in my mouth






In reality two negations are involved in my title Immoralist I first
of all deny the type of man that has hitherto been regarded as the
highestthe good the kind and the charitable and I also
deny that kind of morality which has become recognised and paramount
as moralityinitselfI speak of the morality of decadence or to
use a still cruder term Christian morality I would agree to the
second of the two negations being regarded as the more decisive for
reckoned as a whole the overestimation of goodness and kindness seems
to me already a consequence of decadence a symptom of weakness and
incompatible with any ascending and yeasaying life Negation and
annihilation are inseparable from a yeasaying attitude towards life
Let me halt for a moment at the question of the psychology of the
good man In order to appraise the value of a certain type of man the
cost of his maintenance must be calculatedand the conditions of his
existence must be known The condition of the existence of the good
is falsehood or otherwise expressed the refusal at any price to
see how reality is actually constituted The refusal to see that this
reality is not so constituted as always to be stimulating beneficent
instincts and still less so as to suffer at all moments the intrusion
of ignorant and goodnatured hands To consider distress of all kinds
as an objection as something which must be done away with is the
greatest nonsense on earth generally speaking it is nonsense of the
most disastrous sort fatal in its stupidityalmost as mad as the will
to abolish bad weather out of pity for the poor so to speak In the
great economy of the whole universe the terrors of reality in the
passions in the desires in the will to power are incalculably more
necessary than that form of petty happiness which is called goodness
it is even needful to practise leniency in order so much as to allow
the latter a place at all seeing that it is based upon a falsification
of the instincts I shall have an excellent opportunity of showing the
incalculably calamitous consequences to the whole of history of the
credo of optimism this monstrous offspring of the homines optimi
Zarathustra the first who recognised that the optimist is just as
degenerate as the pessimist though perhaps more detrimental says
Good men never speak the truth False shores and false harbours
were ye taught by the good In the lies of the good were ye born and
bred Through the good everything hath become false and crooked from
the roots Fortunately the world is not built merely upon those
instincts which would secure to the goodnatured herd animal his paltry
happiness To desire everybody to become a good man a gregarious
animal a blueeyed benevolent beautiful soul oras Herbert
Spencer wisheda creature of altruism would mean robbing existence of
its greatest character castrating man and reducing humanity to a sort
of wretched Chinadom And this some have tried to do It is precisely
this that men called morality In this sense Zarathustra calls the
good now the last men and anon the beginning of the end and
above all he considers them as the most detrimental kind of men
because they secure their existence at the cost of Truth and at the
cost of the Future

The goodthey cannot create they are ever the beginning of the end

They crucify him who writeth new values on new tables they sacrifice
unto themselves the future they crucify the whole future of humanity

The goodthey are ever the beginning of the end

And whatever harm the slanderers of the world may do the harm of the
good is the most calamitous of all harm






Zarathustra as the first psychologist of the good man is perforce the
friend of the evil man When a degenerate kind of man has succeeded
to the highest rank among the human species his position must have
been gained at the cost of the reverse typeat the cost of the strong
man who is certain of life When the gregarious animal stands in
the glorious rays of the purest virtue the exceptional man must be
degraded to the rank of the evil If falsehood insists at all costs on
claiming the word truth for its own particular standpoint the really
truthful man must be sought out among the despised Zarathustra allows
of no doubt here he says that it was precisely the knowledge of the
good of the best which inspired his absolute horror of men And
it was out of this feeling of repulsion that he grew the wings which
allowed him to soar into remote futures He does not conceal the fact
that his type of man is one which is relatively superhumanespecially
as opposed to the good man and that the good and the just would
regard his superman as the devil

Ye higher men on whom my gaze now falls this is the doubt that ye
wake in my breast and this is my secret laughter methinks ye would
call my Supermanthe devil So strange are ye in your souls to all
that is great that the Superman would be terrible in your eyes for his
goodness

It is from this passage and from no other that you must set out to
understand the goal to which Zarathustra aspiresthe kind of man that
he conceives sees reality as it is he is strong enough for thishe
is not estranged or far removed from it he is that reality himself in
his own nature can be found all the terrible and questionable character
of reality only thus can man have greatness






But I have chosen the title of Immoral is t as a surname and as a badge
of honour in yet another sense I am very proud to possess this name
which distinguishes me from all the rest of mankind No one hitherto
has felt Christian morality beneath him to that end there were needed
height a remoteness of vision and an abysmal psychological depth not
believed to be possible hitherto Up to the present Christian morality
has been the Circe of all thinkersthey stood at her service What
man before my time had descended into the underground caverns from
out of which the poisonous fumes of this idealof this slandering
of the worldburst forth What man had even dared to suppose that
they were underground caverns Was a single one of the philosophers
who preceded me a psychologist at all and not the very reverse of a
psychologistthat is to say a superior swindler an Idealist
Before my time there was no psychology To be the first in this new
realm may amount to a curse at all events it is a fatality for one
is also the first to despise My danger is the loathing of mankind






Have you understood me That which defines me that which makes me
stand apart from the whole of the rest of humanity is the fact that
I unmasked Christian morality For this reason I was in need of a
word which conveyed the idea of a challenge to everybody Not to have
awakened to these discoveries before struck me as being the sign
of the greatest uncleanliness that mankind has on its conscience
as selfdeception become instinctive as the fundamental will to
be blind to every phenomenon all causality and all reality in
fact as an almost criminal fraud in psychologicis Blindness in
regard to Christianity is the essence of criminalityfor it is the
crime against life Ages and peoples the first as well as the
last philosophers and old women with the exception of five or six
moments in history and of myself the seventh are all alike in
this Hitherto the Christian has been the moral being a peerless
oddity and as a moral being he was more absurd more vain more
thoughtless and a greater disadvantage to himself than the greatest
despiser of humanity could have deemed possible Christian morality
is the most malignant form of all false too the actual Circe of
humanity that which has corrupted mankind It is not error as error
which infuriates me at the sight of this spectacle it is not the
millenniums of absence of goodwill of discipline of decency and
of bravery in spiritual things which betrays itself in the triumph of
Christianity it is rather the absence of nature it is the perfectly
ghastly fact that antinature itself received the highest honours as
morality and as law and remained suspended over man as the Categorical
Imperative Fancy blundering in this way not as an individual
not as a people but as a whole species as humanity To teach the
contempt of all the principal instincts of life to posit falsely the
existence of a soul of a spirit in order to be able to defy the
body to spread the feeling that there is something impure in the very
first prerequisite of lifein sex to seek the principle of evil in
the profound need of growth and expansionthat is to say in severe
selflove the term itself is slanderous and conversely to see a
higher moral valuebut what am I talking aboutI mean the moral
value per se in the typical signs of decline in the antagonism of
the instincts in selflessness in the loss of ballast in the
suppression of the personal element and in love of ones neighbour
neighbouritis What is humanity itself in a state of degeneration
Has it always been in this state One thing is certain that ye are
taught only the values of decadence as the highest values The morality
of selfrenunciation is essentially the morality of degeneration the
fact I am going to the dogs is translated into the imperative
Ye shall all go to the dogsand not only into the imperative This
morality of selfrenunciation which is the only kind of morality that
has been taught hitherto betrays the will to nonentityit denies life
to the very roots There still remains the possibility that it is not
mankind that is in a state of degeneration but only that parasitical
kind of manthe priest who by means of morality and lies has
climbed up to his position of determinator of values who divined in
Christian morality his road to power And to tell the truth this
is my opinion The teachers and I leaders of mankindincluding the
theologianshave been every one of them decadents hence their
transvaluation of all values into a hostility towards life hence
morality The definition of morality Morality is the idiosyncrasy of
decadents actuated by a desire to avenge themselves with success upon
life I attach great value to this definition






Have you understood me I have not uttered a single word which I had
not already said five years ago through my mouthpiece Zarathustra
The unmasking of Christian morality is an event which unequalled in
history it is a real catastrophe The man who throws light upon it
is a force majeure a fatality he breaks the history of man into
two Time is reckoned up before him and after him The lightning
flash of truth struck precisely that which theretofore had stood
highest he who understands what was destroyed by that flash should
look to see whether he still holds anything in his hands Everything
which until then was called truth has been revealed as the most
detrimental most spiteful and most subterranean form of life the
holy pretext which was the improvement of man has been recognised
as a ruse for draining life of its energy and of its blood Morality
conceived as Vampirism The man who unmasks morality has also
unmasked the worthlessness of the values in which men either believe
or have believed he no longer sees anything to be revered in the most
venerable maneven in the types of men that have been pronounced
holy all he can see in them is the most fatal kind of abortions
fatal because they fascinate The concept God was invented as
the opposite of the concept lifeeverything detrimental poisonous
and slanderous and all deadly hostility to life wad bound together
in one horrible unit in Him The concepts beyond and true world
were invented in order to depreciate the only world that existsin
order that no goal or aim no sense or task might be left to earthly
reality The concepts soul spirit and last of all the concept
immortal soul were invented in order to throw contempt on the body
in order to make it sick and holy in order to cultivate an attitude
of appalling levity towards all things in life which deserve to be
treated seriously ie the questions of nutrition and habitation
of intellectual diet the treatment of the sick cleanliness and
weather Instead of health we find the salvation of the soulthat
is to say a folie circulate fluctuating between convulsions and
penitence and the hysteria of redemption The concept sin together
with the torture instrument appertaining to it which is the concept
free will was invented in order to confuse and muddle our instincts
and to render the mistrust of them mans second nature In the concepts
disinterestedness and selfdenial the actual signs of decadence
are to be found The allurement of that which is detrimental the
inability to discover ones own advantage and selfdestruction are
made into absolute qualities into the duty the holiness and
the divinity of man Finallyto keep the worst to the lastby the
notion of the good man all that is favoured which is weak ill
botched and sickinitself which ought to be wiped out The law
of selection is thwarted an ideal is made out of opposition to the
proud wellconstituted man to him who says yea to life to him who
is certain of the future and who guarantees the futurethis man is
henceforth called the evil one And all this was believed in as
moralityEcrasez linfme

EDITORIAL NOTE TO POETRY


The editor begs to state that contrary to his announcement in
the Editorial Note to The Joyful Wisdom in which he declared
his intention of publishing all of Nietzsches poetry he has
nevertheless withheld certain less important verses from publication
This alteration in his plans is due to his belief that it is an
injustice and an indiscretion on the part of posterity to surprise an
author as it were in his nglig or in plain English in his
shirtsleeves Authors generally are very sensitive on this point and
rightly so a visit behind the scenes is not precisely to the advantage
of the theatre and even finished pictures not yet framed are not
readily shown by the careful artist As the German edition however
contains nearly all that Nietzsche left behind either in small
notebooks or on scraps of paper the editor could not well suppress
everything that was not prepared for publication by Nietzsche himself
more particularly as some of the verses are really very remarkable
He has therefore made a very plentiful selection from the Songs
and Epigrams nearly all of which are to be found translated here
and from the Fragments of the Dionysus Dithyrambs of which over half
have been given All the complete Dionysus Dithyrambs appear in this
volume save those which are duplicates of verses already translated
in the Fourth Part of Zarathustra These Dionysus Dithyrambs were
prepared ready for press by Nietzsche himself He wrote the final
manuscript during the summer of  in Sils Maria their actual
composition however belongs to an earlier date

All the verses unless otherwise stated have been translated by Mr
Paul Victor Cohn

    TO MELANCHOLY


    O Melancholy be not wroth with me
      That I this pen should point to praise thee only
    And in thy praise with head bowed to the knee
      Squat like a hermit on a treestump lonely
    Thus oft thou sawst meyesterday at least
      Full in the morning sun and its hot beaming
    While visioning the carrion of his feast
      The hungry vulture valleyward flew screaming

    Yet didst thou err foul bird albeit I
      So like a mummy gainst my log lay leaning
    Thou couldst not see these eyes whose ecstasy
      Rolled hither thither proud and overweening
    What though they did not soar unto thine height
      or reached those faroff cloudreared precipices
    For that they sank the deeper so they might
      Within themselves light Destinys abysses

    Thus oft in sullenness perverse and free
      Bent hideous like a savage at his altar
    There Melancholy held I thought of thee
      A penitent though youthful with his psalter

    So crouched did I enjoy the vultures span
      The thunder of the avalanches paces
    Thou spakest to menor wast false like man
      Thou spakest but with stern and dreadful faces

    Harsh goddess thou of Nature wild and stark
      Mistress that comst with threats to daunt and quell me
    To point me out the vultures airy are
      And laughing avalanches to repel me
    Around us gnashing pants the lust to kill
      The torment to win life in all its changes
    Alluring on some cliff abrupt and chill
      Some flower craves the butterfly that ranges

    All this am Ishuddering I feel it all
      O butterfly beguiled O lonely flower
    The vulture and the icepent waterfall
      The moaning stormall symbols of thy power
    Thou goddess grim before whom deeply bowed
      With head on knee my lips with pans bursting
    I lift a dreadful song and cry aloud
      For Life for Life for Lifeforever thirsting

    O vengeful goddess be not wroth I ask
      That I to mesh thee in my rhymes have striven
    He trembles who beholds thine awful mask
      He quails to whom thy dread right hand is given
    Song upon trembling song by starts and fits
      I chant in rhythm all my thought unfolding
    The black ink flows the pointed goosequill spits
      O goddess goddessleave me to my scolding




    AFTER A NIGHT STORM


    Today in misty veils thou hangest dimly
      Gloomy goddess oer my windowpane
    Grimly whirl the pallid snowflakes grimly
      Roars the swollen brook unto the plain

    Ah by light of haggard levins glaring
      Neath the untamed thunders roar and roll
    Midst the valleys murk wast thou preparing
      Sorceress thy dank and poisoned bowl

    Shuddering I heard through midnight breaking
      Raptures of thy voiceand howls of pain
    Saw thy bright orbs gleam thy right hand shaking
      With the mace of thunder hurled amain

    Near my dreary couch I heard the crashes
      Of thine armoured steps heard weapons slam
    Heard thy brazen chain strike gainst the sashes
      And thy voice Come hearken who I am

    The immortal Amazon they call me
      All things weak and womanish I shun
    Manly scorn and hate in war enthral me
      Victress I and tigress all in one

    Where I tread there corpses fall before me
      From mine eyes the furious torches fly
    And my brain thinks poisons Bend adore me
      Worm of Earth and Will o Wispor die




    HYMNS TO FRIENDSHIP


    Two Fragments


    

    Goddess Friendship deign to hear the song
      That we sing in friendships honour
    Where the eye of friendship glances
      Filled with all the joy of friendship
      Come thou nigh to aid me
    Rosy dawn in thy gaze and
    In holy hand the faithful pledge of youth eternal


    

    Mornings past the sun of noonday
      Scorches with hot ray our heads
    Let us sit beneath the arbour
    Singing songs in praise of friendship
    Friendship was our lifes red dawning
      And its sunset red shall be




    THE WANDERER


    All through the night a wanderer walks
      Sturdy of stride
    With winding vale and sloping height
      Eer at his side
      Fair is the night
    On on he strides nor slackens speed
    And knows not where his path will lead

    A birds song in the night is heard
    Ah me what hast thou done O bird
      How dost thou grip my sense and feet
      And pourest heartvexation sweet
    Into mine earI must remain
      To hearken fain
    Why lure me with inviting strain

    The good bird speaks staying his song
    I lure not theeno thou art wrong
      With these my trills
    I lure my mate from off the hills
      Nor heed thy plight
    To me alone the nights not fair
    Whats that to thee Forth must thou fare
    On onward ever resting neer

      Why standst thou now
    What has my piping done to thee
      Thou roaming wight
    The good bird pondered silent quite
    Why doth my piping change his plight
      Why stands he now
    That luckless luckless roaming wight




    TO THE GLACIER


    At noontide hour when first
    Into the mountains Summer treads
    Summer the boy with eyes so hot and weary
    Then too he speaks
    Yet we can only see his speech

    His breath is panting like the sick mans breath
    On fevered couch
    The glacier and the fir tree and the spring
    Answer his call
    Yet we their answer only see
    For faster from the rock leaps down
    The torrent stream as though to greet
    And stands like a white column trembling
    All yearning there
    And darker yet and truer looks the firtree
    Than eer before
    And twixt the icemass and the cold grey stone
    A sudden light breaks forth
    Such light I once beheld and marked the sign

    Even the dead mans eye
    Surely once more grows light
    When sorrowful his child
    Gives him embrace and kiss
    Surely once more the flame of light
    Wells out and glowing into life
    The dead eye speaks My child
    Ah child you know I love you true

    So all things glow and speakthe glacier speaks
    The brook the fir
    Speak with their glance the selfsame words
    We love you true
    Ah child you know we love you love you true

    And he
    Summer the boy with eyes so hot and weary
    Woeworn gives kisses
    More ardent ever
    And will not go
    But like to veils he blows his words
    From out his lips
    His cruel words
    My greetings parting
    My coming going
    In youth I die

    All round they hearken
    And scarcely breathe
    No songster sings
    And shuddering run
    Like gleaming ray
    Over the mountain
    All round they ponder
    Nor speak

    Twas at the noon
    At noontide hour when first
    Into the mountains Summer treads
    Summer the boy with eyes so hot and weary




    AUTUMN


    Tis AutumnAutumn yet shall break thy heart
    Fly away fly away
    The sun creeps gainst the hill
    And climbs and climbs
    And rests at every step

    How faded grew the world
    On weary slackened strings the wind
    Playeth his tune
    Fair Hope fled far
    He waileth after

    Tis AutumnAutumn yet shall break thy heart
    Fly away fly away
    O fruit of the tree
    Thou tremblest fallest
    What secret whispered unto thee
    The Night
    That icy shudders deck thy cheek
    Thy cheek of purple hue

    Silent art thou nor dost reply
    Who speaketh still

    Tis AutumnAutumn yet shall break thy heart
    Fly away fly away
    I am not fair
    So speaks the lone starflower
    Yet men I love
    And comfort men
    Many flowers shall they behold
    And stoop to me
    And break me ah
    So that within their eyes shall gleam
    Remembrance swift
    Remembrance of far fairer things than I
    I see itsee itand I perish so

    Tis AutumnAutumn yet shall break thy heart
    Fly away fly away




    CAMPO SANTO DI STAGLIENO


    Maiden in gentle wise
    You stroke your lambs soft fleece
    Yet flashing from your eyes
    Both light and flame neer cease
    Creature of merry jest
    And favourite near and far
    Pious with kindness blest
          Amorosissima

    What broke so soon the chain
    What does your heart deplore
    And who pray would not fain
    If you loved him adore
    Youre mute but from your eye
    The teardrop is not far
    Youre mute youll yearn and die
          Amorosissima




    THE LITTLE BRIG NAMED LITTLE ANGEL


    Little Angel call they me
    Now a ship but once a girl
    Ah and still too much a girl
    My steeringwheel so bright to see
    But for sake of love doth whirl

    Little Angel call they me
    With hundred flags to ornament
    A captain smart on glory bent
    Steers me puffed with vanity
    He himselfs an ornament

    Little Angel call they me
    And whereer a little flame
    Gleams for me I like a lamb
    Go my journey eagerly
    I was always such a lamb

    Little Angel call they me
    Think you I can bark and whine
    Like a dog this mouth of mine
    Throwing smoke and flame full free
    Ah a devils mouth is mine

    Little Angel call they me
    Once I spoke a bitter word
    That my lover when he heard
    Fast and far away did flee
    Yes I killed him with that word

    Little Angel call they me
    Hardly heard I sprang so glib
    From the cliff and broke a rib
    From my frame my soul went free
    Yes escaped me through that rib

    Little Angel call they me
    Then my soul like cat in flight
    Straight did on this ship alight
    Swiftly boundingone two three
    Yes its claws are swift to smite

    Little Angel call they me
    Now a ship but once a girl
    Ah and still too much a girl
    My steeringwheel so bright to see
    For sake of love alone doth whirl




    MAIDENS SONG


    Yesterday with seventeen years
    Wisdom reached I a maiden fair
    I am greyhaired it appears
    Now in all thingssave my hair

    Yesterday I had a thought
    Wast a thoughtyou laugh and scorn
    Did you ever have a thought
    Rather was a feeling born

    Dare a woman think This screed
    Wisdom long ago begot
    Follow woman must not lead
    If she thinks she follows not

    Wisdom speaksI credit naught
    Rather hops and stings like flea
    Woman seldom harbours thought
    If she thinks no good is she

    To this wisdom old renowned
    Bow I in deep reverence
    Now my wisdom Ill expound
    In its very quintessence

    A voice spoke in me yesterday
    As everlisten if you can
    Woman is more beauteous aye
    But more interestingman




    PIA CARITATEVOLE AMOROSISSIMA


    Cave where the dead ones rest
    O marble falsehood thee
    I love for easy jest
    My soul thou settest free

    Today today alone
    My soul to tears is stirred
    At thee the pictured stone
    At thee the graven word

    This picture none need wis
    I kissed the other day
    When theres so much to kiss
    Why did I kiss theclay

    Who knows the reason why
    A tombstone fool you laugh
    I kissedIll not deny
    Een the long epitaph




    TO FRIENDSHIP


    Hail to thee Friendship
    My hope consummate
    My first red daybreak
    Alas so endless
    Oft path and night seemed
    And lifes long road
    Aimless and hateful
    Now life Id double
    In thine eyes seeing
    Dawnglory triumph
    Most gracious goddess




    PINE TREE AND LIGHTNING


    Oer man and beast I grew so high
    And speakbut none will give reply

    Too lone and tall my crest did soar
    I wait what am I waiting for

    The clouds are grown too nigh of late
    Tis the first lightning I await




    TREE IN AUTUMN


    Why did ye blockheads me awaken
      While I in blissful blindness stood
    Neer I by fear more fell was shaken
      Vanished my golden dreaming mood

    Bearelephants with trunks all greedy
      Knock first Where have your manners fled
    I threwand fear has made me speedy
      Dishes of ripe fruitat your head




    AMONG FOES OR AGAINST CRITICS


    After a Gipsy Proverb


    Here the gallows there the cord
      And the hangmans ruddy beard
    Round the venomglancing horde
      Nothing new to mes appeared
    Many times Ive seen the sight
      Now laughing in your face I cry
    Hanging me is useless quite
      Die Nay nay I cannot die

    Beggars all Ye envy me
      Winning what ye never won
    True I suffer agony
      But for youyour life is done
    Many times Ive faced deaths plight
      Yet steam and light and breath am I
    Hanging me is useless quite
      Die Nay nay I cannot die




    THE NEW COLUMBUS


    Dearest said Columbus never
      Trust a Genoese again
    At the blue he gazes ever
      Distance doth his soul enchain

    Strangeness is to me too dear
      Genoa has sunk and passed
    Heart be cool Hand firmly steer
      Sea before me landat last

    Firmly let us plant our feet
      Neer can we give up this game
    From the distance what doth greet
      One death one happiness one fame




    IN LONESOMENESS


    The cawing crows
    Townwards on whirring pinions roam
    Soon come the snows
    Thrice happy now who hath a home

    Fastrooted there
    Thou gazest backwardsoh how long
    Thou fool why dare
    Ere winter come this world of wrong

    This worlda gate
    To myriad deserts dumb and hoar
    Who lost through fate
    What thou hast lost shall rest no more

    Now standst thou pale
    A frozen pilgrimage thy doom
    Like smoke whose trail
    Cold and still colder skies consume

    Fly bird and screech
    Like desertfowl thy song apart
    Hide out of reach
    Fool in grim ice thy bleeding heart

    Firmly let us plant our feet
      Neer can we give up this game
    From the distance what doth greet
      One death one happiness one fame

    The cawing crows
      Townwards on whirring pinions roam
    Soon come the snows
      Woe unto him who hath no home

    My Answer

    The man presumes
      Good Lordto think that Id return
    To those warm rooms
      Where snug the German ovens burn

    My friend you see
      Tis but thy folly drives me far
    Pity for thee
      And all that German blockheads are




    VENICE


    ON the bridge I stood
    Mellow was the night
    Music came from far
    Drops of gold outpoured
    On the shimmering waves
    Song gondolas light
    Floated atwinkling out into the dusk

    The chords of my soul moved
    By unseen impulse throbbed
    Secretly into a gondola song
    With thrills of brighthued ecstasy
    Had I a listener there

    Yet tender doth the word remain
    Soon it is ill soon well again
    So if its little life youd spare
    O grasp it lightly and with care
    Nor heavy hand upon it lay

    There it would lie unsouled poor thing

    A restless spirit never free

    Disgusted more and more and flayed and scoured
    Till from each cup of balm you poison drink
    Alas and by the Cross all helpless sink
    You too you too among the overpowered

    For long I watched this play so weirdly shaped

    Friend Yorick If this thought gives pain
    As now it does I fear

    Tis but your own dear child
    Your flesh and blood
    That tortures you and gives you pain
    Your little rogue and donogood
    See if the rod will change its mood

    In brief friend Yorick leave that drear

    Not at the beck of other men
    God made as stupid as he could
    The worldwell let me praise him then

    And if I make not straight my track

    Thats how the sage begins his tack
    And that is how the fool willend

                             

    The world stands never still
    Night loves the glowing day
    Sweet sounds to ear I will
    And sweeter still I may

DIONYSUSDITHYRAMBS





These are the songs of Zarathustra which he sang to
himself so as to endure his last solitude



    OF THE POVERTY OF THE RICHEST


    Ten years passed by
    Not a drop reached me
    No rainfraught wind no dew of love
    A rainless land
    Now entreat I my wisdom
    Not to become stingy in this drought
    Overflow thyself trickle thy dew
    Be thyself the rain of the parched wilderness

    I once bade the clouds
    Depart from my mountains
    Once I said to them
    More light ye dark ones
    Today I entice them to come
    Make me dark with your udders
    I would milk you
    Ye cows of the heights
    Milkwarm wisdom sweet dew of love
    I pour over the land

    Away away ye truths
    That look so gloomy
    I will not have on my mountains
    Bitter impatient truths
    May truth approach me today
    Gilded by smiles
    Sweetened by the sun browned by love
    A ripe truth I would fain break off from the tree

    Today I stretch my hands
    Toward the tresses of chance
    Wise enough to lead
    To outwit chance like a child
    Today I will be hospitable
    Gainst the unwelcome
    Gainst destiny itself I will not be prickly
    Zarathustra is no hedgehog

    My soul
    Insatiable with its tongue
    Has already tasted of all things good and evil
    And has dived into all depths
    But ever like the cork
    It swims to the surface again
    And floats like oil upon brown seas
    Because of this soul men call me fortunate

    Who are my father and mother
    Is not my father Prince Plenty
    And my mother Silent Laughter
    Did not the union of these two
    Beget me the enigmatic beast
    Me the monster of light
    Me Zarathustra the squanderer of all wisdom

    Sick today from tenderness
    A dewy wind
    Zarathustra sits waiting waiting on his mountains
    Sweet and stewing
    In his own juice
    Beneath his own summit
    Beneath his ice
    Weary and happy
    A Creator on his seventh day

    Silence
    A truth passes over me
    Like a cloud
    With invisible lightnings it strikes me
    On broad slow stairs
    Its happiness climbs to me
    Come come beloved truth

    Silence
    Tis my truth
    From timid eyes
    From velvet shudders
    Her glance meets mine
    Sweet and wicked a maidens glance
    She has guessed the reason of my happiness
    She has guessed meha what is she thinking
    A purple dragon
    Lurks in the abyss of her maidens glance

    Silence My truth is speaking

    Woe to thee Zarathustra
    Thou lookest like one
    That hath swallowed gold
    They will slit up thy belly yet

    Thou art too rich
    Thou corrupter of many
    Thou makest too many jealous
    Too many poor
    Even on me thy light casts a shadow
    I feel chill go away thou rich one
    Go away Zarathustra from the path of thy sun




    BETWEEN BIRDS OF PREY


    Who would here descend
    How soon
    Is he swallowed up by the depths
    But thou Zarathustra
    Still lovest the abysses
    Lovest them as doth the fir tree

    The fir flings its roots
    Where the rock itself gazes
    Shuddering at the depths
    The fir pauses before the abysses
    Where all around
    Would fain descend
    Amid the impatience
    Of wild rolling leaping torrents
    It waits so patient stern and silent
    Lonely

    Lonely
    Who would venture
    Here to be guest
    To be thy guest

    A bird of prey perchance
    Joyous at others misfortune
    Will cling persistent
    To the hair of the steadfast watcher
    With frenzied laughter
    A vultures laughter

    Wherefore so steadfast
    Mocks he so cruel
    He must have wings who loves the abyss
    He must not stay on the cliff
    As thou who hangest there

    O Zarathustra
    Cruellest Nimrod
    Of late still a hunter of God
    A spiders web to capture virtue
    An arrow of evil
    Now
    Hunted by thyself
    Thine own prey
    Caught in the grip of thine own soul

    Now
    Lonely to me and thee
    Twofold in thine own knowledge
    Mid a hundred mirrors
    False to thyself
    Mid a hundred memories
    Uncertain
    Weary at every wound
    Shivering at every frost
    Throttled in thine own noose
    Selfknower
    Selfhangman

    Why didst bind thyself
    With the noose of thy wisdom
    Why luredst thyself
    Into the old serpents paradise
    Why stolest into
    Thyself thyself

    A sick man now
    Sick of serpents poison
    A captive now
    Who hast drawn the hardest lot
    In thine own shaft
    Bowed as thou workest
    In thine own cavern
    Digging at thyself
    Helpless quite
    Stiff
    A cold corse
    Overwhelmed with a hundred burdens
    Overburdened by thyself
    A knower
    A selfknower
    The wise Zarathustra

    Thou soughtest the heaviest burden
    So foundest thou thyself
    And canst not shake thyself off

    Watching
    Chewing
    One that stands upright no more
    Thou wilt grow deformed even in thy grave
    Deformed spirit

    And of late still so proud
    On all the stilts of thy pride
    Of late still the godless hermit
    The hermit with one comradethe devil
    The scarlet prince of every devilment

    Now
    Between two nothings
    Huddled up
    A questionmark
    A weary riddle
    A riddle for vultures
    They will solve thee
    They hunger already for thy solution
    They flutter already about their riddle
    About thee the doomed one
    O Zarathustra
    Selfknower
    Selfhangman




    THE SUN SINKS


    I

    Not much longer thirstest thou
    O burntup heart
    Promise is in the air
    From unknown mouths I feel a breath
    The great coolness comes
    My sun stood hot above me at noonday
    A greeting to you that are coming
    Ye sudden winds
    Ye cool spirits of afternoon

    The air is strange and pure
    See how the night
    Leers at me with eyes askance
    Like a seducer
    Be strong my brave heart
    And ask not Why


    

    The day of my life
    The sun sinks
    And the calm flood
    Already is gilded
    Warm breathes the rock
    Did happiness at noonday
    Take its siesta well upon it
    In green light
    Happiness still glimmers up from the brown abyss

    Day of my life
    Eventides nigh
    Thy eye already
    Glows halfbroken
    Thy dew already
    Pours out its teardrops
    Already over the white seas
    Walks the purple of thy love
    Thy last hesitating holiness


    

    Golden gaiety come
    Thou the sweetest foretaste
    Foretaste of death
    Went I my way too swiftly
    Now that the foot grows weary
    Thine eye still catches me
    Thy happiness still catches me

    Around but waves and play
    Whatever was hard
    Sank into blue oblivion
    My boat now stands idle
    Storm and motionhow did it forget them
    Desire and Hope are drowned
    Sea and soul are becalmed

    Seventh Solitude
    Never felt
    Sweet certainty nearer
    Or warmer the suns ray
    Glows not the ice of my summit yet
    Silvery light a fish
    Now my vessel swims out




    THE LAST DESIRE


    So would I die
    As then I saw him die
    The friend who like a god
    Into my darkling youth
    Threw lightnings light and fire
    Buoyant yet deep was he
    Yea in the battles strife
    With the gay dancers heart

    Amid the warriors
    His was the lightest heart
    Amid the conquerors
    His brow was dark with thought
    He was a fate poised on his destiny
    Unbending casting thought into the past
    And future such was he

    Fearful beneath the weight of victory
    Yet chanting as both victory and death
    Came hand and hand to him

    Commanding even as he lay in death
    And his command that man annihilate

    So would I die
    As then I saw him die
    Victorious and destroying




    THE BEACON


    Here where the island grew amid the seas
    A sacrificial rock hightowering
    Here under darkling heavens
    Zarathustra lights his mountainfires
    A beacon for ships that have strayed
    A beacon for them that have an answer

    These flames with greywhite belly
    In cold distances sparkle their desire
    Stretches its neck towards ever purer heights
    A snake upreared in impatience
    This signal I set up there before me
    This flame is mine own soul
    Insatiable for new distances
    Speeding upward upward its silent heat

    Why flew Zarathustra from beasts and men
    Why fled he swift from all continents
    Six solitudes he knows already
    But even the sea was not lonely enough for him
    On the island he could climb on the mount he
        became flame
    At the seventh solitude
    He casts a fishingrod far oer his head

    Stormtossed seamen Wreckage of ancient stars
    Ye seas of the future Uncompassed heavens
    At all lonely ones I now throw my fishingrod
    Give answer to the flames impatience
    Let me the fisher on high mountains
    Catch my seventh last solitude




    FAME AND ETERNITY


    I

    Speak tell me how long wilt thou brood
    Upon this adverse fate of thine
    Beware lest from thy doleful mood
    A countenance  dark is brewed
    That men in seeing thee divine
    A hate more bitter than the brine
                       
    Speak why does Zarathustra roam
    Upon the towering mountainheight
    Distrustful cankered dour his home
    Is shut so long from human sight
                       
    See suddenly flames forth a lightningflash
    The pit profound with thunderous challenge fights
    Against the heavens midst clamorous crack and crash
    Of the great mountain Cradled in the heights
    Born as the fruit of hate and lightnings love
    The wrath of Zarathustra dwells above
    And looms with menace of a thundercloud
                       
    Ye who have roofs go quickly creep and hide
    To bed ye tenderlings For thunders loud
    Upon the blasts of storm triumphant ride
    And bastions and ramparts sway and rock

    The lightning sears the dusky face of night
    And eerie truths like gleams of Hades mock
    The sense familiar So in storm breaks forth
    The flaming curse of Zarathustras wrath


    

    This fame which all the wide world loves
    I touch with gloves
    And scorning beat
    Beneath my feet
                       
    Who hanker after the pay of it
    Who cast themselves in the way of it
    These prostitutes to gold
    These merchant folk They fold
    Their unctuous palms over the jingling fame
    Whose ringing chink wins all the worlds acclaim
                       
    Hast thou the lust to buy It needs no skill
    They are all venal Let thy purse be deep
    And let their greedy paws unhindered creep
    Into its depths So let them take their fill
    For if thou dost not offer them enough
    Their virtue theyll parade to hide their huff
                       
    They are all virtuous yea every one
    Virtue and fame are ever in accord
    So long as time doth run

    The tongues that prate of virtue as reward
    Earn fame For virtue is fames clever bawd
                       
    Amongst these virtuous I prefer to be
    One guilty of all vile and horrid sin
    And when I see fames importunity
    So advertise her shameless harlotry
    Ambition turns to gall Amidst such kin
    One place alone the lowest would I win
                       
    This fame which all the wide world loves
    I touch with gloves
    And scorning beat
    Beneath my feet


    

    Hush I see vastnessand of vasty things
    Shall man be dumb unless he can enshrine
    Them with his words Then take the might which brings
    The heart upon thy tongue charmed wisdom mine
                       
    I look above there rolls the starstrown sea
    O night mute silence voiceless cry of stars
    And lo A sign The heaven its verge unbars
    A shining constellation falls towards me


    

    O loftiest starclustered crown of Being
    O carved tablets of Eternity
    And dost thou truly bend thy way to me
    Thy loveliness to allobscurity
    What Fearst not to unveil before my seeing
                       
    O shield of Destiny
    O carven tablets of Eternity
    Yea verily thou knowestwhat mankind doth hate
    What I alone do love thou art inviolate
    To strokes of change and time of fates the fate
    Tis only thou O dire Necessity
    Canst kindle everlasting love in me
                       
    O loftiest crown of Life O shield of Fate
    That no desire can reach to invocate
    That neer defiled or sullied is by Nay
    Eternal Yea of life for eer am I thy Yea
    For I love thee Eternity

FRAGMENTS OF DIONYSUSDITHYRAMBS




SPEECHES PARABLES AND SIMILES


    

    My homes in the highlands
    For the highlands I yearn not
    I raise not mine eyes aloft
    I am one that looks downward
    One that must blessAll
    blessers look downward


    

    Thus I began
    I unlearned all selfpity


    

    Not in shattering idols
    But in shattering the idolworshipper in thee
    Consisted thy valour


    

    See there stand
    Those heavy cats of granite
    Those old old Values
    Woe is me How overthrow them
                
    Scratching cats
    With paws that are fettered
    There they sit
    And their glance is poison


    

    A lightningflash became my wisdom
    With sword of adamant it clove me every
        darkness


    

    A thought that still
    Flows hot like lava
    But all streams of lava
    Build a fortress around them
    And every thought finally
    Oppresses itself with laws


    

    Such is my will
    And since tis my will
    All goes as I wish
    That was my final wisdom
    I willed what I must
    And thus I forced every must
    Since then has been for me no must


    

    Deceit
    Is wars whole art
    The foxs skin
    Is my secret shirt of mail


    

    We of the new underworld
    Grub for new treasures
    Godless it seemed to the ancients
    To disturb the earths bowels for treasures
    And once more this godlessness revives
    Hear ye not earths bowels thunder


    

    Looking for love and finding masks
    Finding accursed masks and having to break them


    

    Do I love you
    Yes as the rider loves his steed
    That carryeth him to his goal


    

    His pity is cruel
    His loving handclasp bruises
    Give not a giant your hand


    

    Ye fear me
    Ye fear the tautstrung bow
    Ye fear a man might set his arrow to the bow


    

    I am naught but a wordmaker
    What matter words
    What matter I


    

    Ah my friends
    Whither has flown all that is called good
    Whither all good people
    Whither the innocence of all these falsehoods
    I call all good
    Leaves and grass happiness blessing and rain


    

    Not through his sins and greatest follies
    Through his perfection I suffered
    As I suffered most from men


    

    Man is evil
    So spake the wisest
    For my consolement


    

    And only when I to myself am a burden
    Do ye fall heavy upon me


    

    Too soon already
    I laugh again
    For a foe tis easy
    To make me amends


    

    Gentle am I towards man and chance
    Gentle with all men and even with grasses
    A spot of sunshine on winter curtains
    Moist with tenderness
    A thawing wind to snowbound souls
                    
    Proudminded towards trifling
    Gains where I see the hucksters long finger
    Tis aye my pleasure
    To be bamboozled
    Such is the bidding of my fastidious taste


    

    A strange breath breathes and spits at me
    Am I a mirror that straightway is clouded


    

    Little people
    Confiding openhearted
    But lowbuilt portals
    Where only the low of stature can enter
                    
    How can I get through the citygate
    Who had forgotten to live among dwarfs


    

    My wisdom was like to the sun
    I longed to give them light
    But I only deceived them
    The sun of my wisdom
    Blinded the eyes
    Of these poor bats


    

    Blacker and eviller things didst thou see than ever
        a seer did
    Through the revels of Hell no sage had ever
        journeyed


    

    Back on my heels too closely ye follow
    Back lest my wisdom should tread on you crush
       you


    

    He goes to hell who goes thy ways
    So be it I to my hell
    Ill pave the way myself with wellmade maxims


    

    Your God you tell me
    Is a God of love
    The sting of conscience
    A sting from God
    A sting of love


    

    They chew gravel
    They lie on their bellies
    Before little round things
    They adore all that falleth not down
    These last servants of God
    Believers in reality


    

    They made their God out of nothing
    What wonder if now he is naught


    

    Ye loftier men There have once been
    More thoughtful times more reflective
    Than is our today and tomorrow


    
    Our time is like a sick woman
    Let her but shriek rave scold
    And break the tables and dishes


    

    Ye mount
    Is it true that ye mount
    Ye loftier men

    Are ye not pray
    Like to a ball
    Sped to the heights
    By the lowest thats in you
    Do ye not flee from yourselves O ye climbers


    

    All that you thought
    You had to despise
    Where you only renounced


    

    All men repeat the refrain
    No no and thrice say No
    Whats all this yapyap talk of heaven
    We would not enter the kingdom of heaven
    The kingdom of earth shall be ours


    

    The will redeemeth
    He that has nothing to do
    In a Nothing finds food for trouble


    

    You cannot endure it more
    Your tyrannous destiny
    Love ityoure given no choice


    

    These alone free us from woes
    Choose now I
    Sudden death
    Or longdrawnout love


    

    Of death we are sure
    So why not be merry


    

    The worst of pleas
    I have hidden from youthat life grew tedious
    Throw it away that ye find it again to your taste


    

    Lonely days
    Ye must walk on valorous feet


    

    Loneliness
    Plants naught it ripens
    And even then you must have the sun for your
    friend


    

    Once more must ye plunge in the throngIn
    the throng ye grow hard and smooth
    Solitude withers
    And lastly destroys


    

    When on the hermit comes the great fear
    When he runs and runs
    And knows not whither
    When the storms roar behind
    And the lightning bears witness against him
    And his cavern breeds spectres
    And fills him with dread


    

    Throw thy pain in the depths
    Man forget Man forget
    Divine is the art of forgetting
    Wouldst fly
    Wouldst feel at home in the heights
    Throw thy heaviest load in the sea
    Here is the sea hurl thyself in the sea
    Divine is the art of forgetting


    

    Look forward never look back
    We sink to the depths
    If we peer ever into the depths


    

    Beware beware
    Of warning the reckless
    Thy warning will drive them
    To leap into every abyss

    

    Why hurled he himself from the heights
    What led him astray
    His pity for all that is lowly led him astray
    And now he lies there broken useless and cold

    

    Whither went he Who knows
    We only know that he sank
    A star went out in the desolate void
    And lone was the void


    

    What we have not
    But need
    We must take
    And so a good conscience I took


    

    Who is there that could bestow right upon thee
    So take thy right


    

    O ye waves
    Wondrous waves are ye wroth with me
    Do ye raise me your crests in wrath
    With my rudder I smite
    Your folly full square
    This bark ye yourselves
    To immortal life will carry along


    

    When no new voice was heard
    Ye made from old words
    A law
    When life grows stark there shoots up the law


    

    What none can refute
    Ye say must be true
    Oh ye innocents


    

    Art thou strong
    Strong as an ass Strong as God
    Art thou proud
    So proud as to flaunt
    Unashamed thy conceit


    

    Beware
    And neer beat the drum
    Of thy destiny I
    Go out of the way
    From all pompom of fame
                    
    Be not known too soon
    Be one that has hoarded renown


    

    Wilt thou grasp at the thorns
    Thy fingers must pay
    Grasp at a poniard


    

    Be a tablet of gold
    They will grave upon thee
    In golden script


    

    Upright he stands
    With more sense of justice
    In his outermost toe
    Than I have in all my head
    A virtuemonster
    Mantled in white


    

    Already he mimics himself
    Already weary he grows
    Already he seeks the paths he has trod
    Who of late still loved all tracks untrodden

    Secretly burnt
    Not for his faith
    Rather because he had lost the heart
    To find new faith


    

    Too long he sat in the cage
    That runaway
    Too long he dreaded
    A gaoler

    Timorous now he goeth his ways
    All things make him to stumble
    The shadow een of a stick makes him to stumble


    

    Ye chambers smoky and musty
    Ye cages and narrow hearts
    How could your spirit be free


    

    Narrow souls
    Huckstersouls
    When money leaps into the box
    The soul leaps into it too


    

    Are ye women
    That ye wish to suffer
    From that which ye love


    

    They are cold these men of learning
    Would that a lightningflash might strike their food
    And their mouths could learn to eat fire


    

    Your false love
    For the past
    A love for the graves of the dead
    Is a theft from life
    That steals all the future
                    
    An antiquary
    Is a craftsman of dead things
    Who lives among coffins and skeletons


    

    Only the poet who can lie
    Wilfully skilfully
    Can tell the truth


    

    Our chase after truth
    Ist a chase after happiness


    

    Truth
    Is a woman no better
    Cunning in her shame
    Of what she likes best
    She will know naught
    And covers her face
    To what doth she yield
    But to violence
    Violence she needs
    Be hard ye sages
    Ye must compel her
    That shamefaced Truth
    For her happiness
    She needs constraintShe
    is a woman no better


    

    We thought evil of each other
    We were too distant
    But now in this tiny hut
    Pinned to one destiny
    How could we still be foes
    We must needs love those
    Whom we cannot escape


    

    Love thy foe
    Let the robber rob thee
    The woman hears anddoes it


    

    A proud eye
    With silken curtains
    Seldom clear
    Honours him that may see it unveiled


    

    Sluggard eyes
    That seldom love
    But when they love the levin flashes
    As from shafts of gold
    Where a dagger keeps guard at the treasure of love


    

    They are crabs for whom I have no fellowfeeling
    Grasp them they pinch you
    Leave them alone and they walk backward


    

    Crooked go great rivers and men
    Crooked but turned to their goal
    That is their highest courage
    They dreaded not crooked paths


    

    Wouldst catch them
    Then speak to them
    As to stray sheep
    Your path your path
    You have lost
    They follow all
    That flatter them so
    What had we a path
    Each whispers the other
    It really seems that we have a path

volunteer support

necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition
