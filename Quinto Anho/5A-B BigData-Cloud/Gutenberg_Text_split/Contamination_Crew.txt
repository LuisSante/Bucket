Profession vs Samuel B Jenkins Physician First Court of Medical
Affairs final action pending

 COM COD SVB VOROCHISLOV SECTOR th GALACTIC PERIOD  
     GENERAL SURVEY SHIP MERCY TO HOSPITAL EARTH

 VIA FASTEST POSSIBLE ROUTING PRIORITY UNASSIGNED

 TO Lucius Darby Physician Grade I Black Service Director of Galactic
     Periphery Services Hospital Earth

 FROM Samuel B Jenkins Physician Grade VI Red Service General
     Practice Patrol Ship Lancet Attached GSS Mercy pro tem

SIR The following communication is directed to your attention in hopes
that it may anticipate various charges which are certain to be placed
against me as a Physician of the Red Service upon the return of the
General Survey Ship Mercy to Hospital Earth expected arrival four
months from above date

These charges will undoubtedly be preferred by one Turvold Neelsen
Physician Grade II of the Black Service and Commander of the Mercy on
its current survey mission into the Vorochislov Sector Exactly what the
charges will be I cannot say since the Black Doctor in question refuses
either audience or communication with me at the present time however
it seems likely that treason incompetence and mutinous insubordination
will be among the milder complaints registered It is possible that even
Malpractice might be added so you can readily understand the reasons
for this statement

The following will also clarify my attached request that the GSS
Mercy upon arrival in orbit around Hospital Earth be met immediately
by a decontamination ship carrying a vat of hydrochloric acid
concentration  measuring no less than twenty by thirty by fifty
feet and that Quarantine officials be prepared to place the entire crew
of the Mercy under physical and psychiatric observation for a period
of no less than six weeks upon disembarkation

The facts in brief are as follows

Three months ago as crew of the General Practice Patrol Ship Lancet
my colleague Green Doctor Wallace Stone and myself began investigating
certain peculiar conditions existing on the fourth planet of Mauki
Vorochislov Sector Class I Medical Service Contract The entire
population of that planet was found to be suffering from a mass
psychotic delusion of rather spectacular proportions namely that they
and their entire planet were in imminent danger of being devoured in
toto by an indestructible nonhumanoid creature which they called a
hlorg The Maukivi were insistent that a hlorg had already totally
consumed a nonexistent outer planet in their system and was now hard
at work on neighboring Mauki V It was their morbid fear that Mauki IV
was next on its list No amount of reassurance could convince them of
the foolishness of these fears although we exhausted our energy our
patience and our food and medical supplies in the effort Ultimately we
referred the matter to the Grey Service feeling confident that it was a
psychiatric problem rather than medical or surgical We applied to the
GSS Mercy to take us aboard to replenish our ships supplies and
provide us a muchneeded recovery period The Black Doctor in command
approved our request and brought us aboard

The trouble began two days later

                                   

There were three classes of dirty words in use by the men who travelled
the spaceways back and forth from Hospital Earth

There were the words you seldom used in public but which were colorful
and descriptive in private use

Then there were the words which you seldom used even in private but
which effectively relieved feelings when directed at mirrors inanimate
objects and people who had just left the room

Finally there were the words that you just didnt use period You knew
they existed youd heard them used at one time or another but to hear
them spoken out in plain EarthEnglish was enough to rock the most
spacehardened of the Galactic Pill Peddlers back on his wellworn
heels

Black Doctor Turvold Neelsens EarthEnglish was spotty at best but the
word came through without any possibility of misinterpretation Red
Doctor Sam Jenkins stared at the little man and felt his face turning as
scarlet as the lining of his uniform cape

But thats ridiculous he finally stammered Quite aside from the
language you use to suggest it

Ah So the word still has some punch left eh At least you puppies
bring something away from your Medical Training even if its only
taboos The Black Doctor scowled across the desk at Jenkins lanky
figure But sometimes my good Doctor it is better to face a fact than
to wait for the fact to face you Sometimes we have to crawl out of our
ivory towers for a minute or twoyou know

Jenkins reddened again He had never had any great love for physicians
of the Black Servicewho didbut he found himself disliking this
short bluntspoken man even more cordially than most Why implicate
the Lancet he burst out Youve landed the Mercy on plenty of
planets before we brought the Lancet aboard her

But we did not have it with us before the Lancet came aboard and we
do have it now The implication is obvious You have brought aboard a
contaminant

Hed said it again

Red Doctor Jenkins face darkened The Green Doctor and I have
maintained the Lancet in perfect conformity with the Sterility Code
Weve taken every precaution on both landing and disembarking
procedures Whats more weve spent the last three months on a planet
with no mutually compatible flora or fauna From Hospital Earth
viewpoint Mauki IV is sterile We made only the briefest checkstop on
Mauki V before joining you It was a barren rock but we decontaminated
again after leaving If you have aa contaminant on board your ship
sir it didnt come from the Lancet And I wont be held responsible

It was strong language to use to a Black Doctor and Sam Jenkins knew
it There were doctors of the Green and Red Services who had spent their
professional lives on some godforsaken planetoid at the edge of the
Galaxy for saying less Red Doctor Sam Jenkins was too near the end of
his Internship too nearly ready for his first Permanent Planetary
Appointment with the rank honor and responsibility it carried to
lightly risk throwing it to the wind at this stage

But a Red Doctor does not bring a contaminant aboard a survey ship he
thought doggedly no matter what the Black Doctor says

Neelsen looked at the young man slowly Then he shrugged Of course
Im merely a pathologist I realize that we know nothing of medicine
nor of disease nor of the manner in which disease is spread All this
is beyond our scope But perhaps youll permit one simple question from
a dull old man just to humor him

Jenkins looked at the floor Im sorry sir

Just so Youve had a very successful cruise this year with the
Lancet I understand

Jenkins nodded

A most successful cruise Four planets elevated from Class IV to Class
II contracts they tell me Morua II elevated from Class VI to Class I
with certain special riders A plaguepanic averted on Setman I and a
very complex virusbacteria symbiosis unravelled on Orb III An
illustrious record You and your colleague from the Green Service are
hoping for a years exemption from training I imagine The Black
Doctor looked up sharply You searched your holds after leaving the
Mauki planets I presume

Jenkins blinked Whyno sir That is we decontaminated according
to

I see You didnt search your holds I suppose you didnt notice your
food supplies dwindling at an alarming rate

No The Red Doctor hesitated Not really

Ah The Black Doctor closed his eyes wearily and flipped an activator
switch The scanner on the far wall buzzed into activity It focussed on
the rear storage hold of the Mercy where the little Lancet was
resting on its landing rack Look closely Doctor

At first Jenkins saw nothing Then his eye caught a long pink
glistening strand lying across the floor of the hold The scanner picked
up the strand followed it to the place where it emerged from a neat
pencilsized hole in the hull of the Lancet The strand snaked
completely across the room and disappeared through another neat hole in
the wall into the next storage hold

Jenkins shook his head as the scanner flipped back to the hole in the
Lancets hull Even as he watched the hole enlarged and a pink blob
began to emerge The blob kept coming and coming until it rested soggily
on the edge of the hole Then it teetered and fell splat on the floor

Friend of yours the Black Doctor asked casually

It was a pink heap of jelly just big enough to fill a scrub bucket It
sat on the floor quivering noxiously Then it sent out pseudopods in
several directions probing the metal floor After a few moments it
began oozing along the strand of itself that lay on the floor and
squeezed through the hole into the next hold

Ugh said Sam Jenkins feeling suddenly sick

The hydroponic tanks are in there the Black Doctor said Youve seen
one of those before

Not in person Jenkins shook his head weakly Only pictures Its a
hlorg We thought it was only a Maukivi persecution fantasy

This thing is growing pretty fast for a persecution fantasy We spotted
it eight hours ago demolishing what was left of your food supply Its
twice as big now as it was then

Well weve got to get rid of it said Jenkins suddenly coming to
life

Amen Doctor

Ill get the survey crew alerted right away We wont waste a minute
And my apologies Jenkins was hurrying for the door Ill get it
cleared out of here fast

I do hope so said the Black Doctor The thing makes me ill just to
think about

Ill give you a cleanship report in twentyfour hours the Red Doctor
said as confidently as he could and beat a hasty retreat down the
corridor He was wishing fervently that he felt as confident as he
sounded

The Maukivi had described the hlorg in excruciating detail He and
Green Doctor Stone had listened and smiled sadly at each other day
after day marvelling at the fanciful delusion Hlorgs indeed And
such creatures to dream upeating growing devouring plant animal and
mineral without discrimination

And the Maukivi had stoutly maintained that this hlorg of theirs was
indestructible

                                   

Green Doctor Wally Stone true to his surgical calling was a man of
action

You mean there is such a thing he exploded when his partner
confronted him with the news For real Not just somebodys pipe
dream

There is said Jenkins and weve got it Here On board the Mercy
Its eating like hellandgone and doubling its size every eight hours

Well what are you waiting for Toss it overboard

Fine And what happens to the next party it happens to land on Were
supposed to be altruists remember Were supposed to worry about the
health of the Galaxy Jenkins shook his head Whatever we do with it
we have to find out just what were tossing before we toss

The creature had made itself at home aboard the Mercy In the spirit
of uninvited guests since time immemorial it had established a toehold
with remarkable asperity and now was digging in for the long winter
Drawn to the hydroponic tanks like a flea to a dog the hlorg had
settled its bulbous pink body down in their murky depths with a
contented gurgle As it grew larger the tanklevels grew lower the
broth clearer

The fact that the twentyfive crewmen of the Mercy depended on those
tanks for their food supply on the fourmonth run back to Hospital Earth
didnt seem to bother the hlorg a bit It just sank down wetly and
began to eat

Under Jenkins whip hand and with Green Doctor Stones assistance the
Survey Crew snapped into action Survey was the soul and lifeblood of
the medical services supplied by Hospital Earth to the inhabited planets
of the Galaxy Centuries before during the era of exploration every
Earth ship had carried a rudimentary Survey Crewa physiologist a
biochemist an immunologist a physicianto determine the safety of
landings on unknown planets Other races were more advanced in
technological and physical sciences in sales or in merchandisingbut
in the biological sciences men of Earth stood unexcelled in the Galaxy
It was not surprising that their casual offerings of medical services
wherever their ships touched had led to a growing demand for those
services until the first Medical Service Contract with Deneb III had
formalized the planetary specialty Earth had become Hospital Earth
physician to a Galaxy surgeon to a thousand worlds midwife to those
susceptible to midwifery and psychiatrist to those whose inner lives
zigged when their outer lives zagged

In the early days it had been a haphazard arrangement but gradually
distinct Services appeared to handle problems of medicine surgery
radiology psychiatry and all the other functions of a wellappointed
medical service Under the direction of the Black Service of Pathology
Hospital ships and Survey ships were dispatched to serve as bases for
the tiny General Practice Patrol ships that answered the calls of the
planets under Contract

But it was the Survey ships that did the basic dirtywork on any new
planet taken under Contractoutlining the physiological and biochemical
aspects of the races involved studying their disease patterns their
immunological types their susceptibility to medical surgical or
psychiatric treatment It was an exacting service to perform and Survey
did an exacting job

Now with their own home base invaded by a hungry pink jellyblob the
Survey Crew of the Mercy dug in with all fours to find a way to
exorcise it

The early returns were not encouraging

Bowman the anatomist spent six hours with the creature Hed go after
the functional anatomy first he thought as he approached the task with
gusto Special organs vital organ systemsafter all every Achilles
had his heel Functional would spot it if anything would

Six hours later he rendered a preliminary report It consisted of a
blank sheet of paper and an expression of wild frustration

Whats this supposed to mean Jenkins asked

Just what it says

But it says nothing

Thats exactly what it means Bowman was a thin wistfullooking man
with a hawk nose and a little brown mustache He subbed as ships cook
when things were slow in his specialty He wasnt a very good cook but
what could anyone do with the sludge from the harvest shelf of a
hydroponic tank Now with the hlorg incumbent there wasnt even any
sludge

I drained off a tank and got a good look at it before it crawled over
into the next one Bowman said Ugly bastard But from a strictly
anatomical standpoint I cant help you a bit

Green Doctor Stone glowered over Jenkins shoulder at the man But
surely you can give us something

Bowman shrugged You want it technical

Any way you like

Your hlorg is an ideal anamorph A nothing Protoplasm just
protoplasm

Jenkins looked up sharply What about his cellular organization

No cells said Bowman Unless theyre submicroscopic and Id need
an electronpeeker to tell you that

No organ systems

Not even an integument You saw how slippery he looked Thats why
Theres nothing holding him in but energy

Now look said Stone He eats doesnt he He must have waste
materials of some sort

Bowman shook his head unhappily Sorry No urates No nitrates No
CO Anyway he doesnt eat because he has nothing to eat with He
absorbs And that includes the lining of the tanks which he seems to
like as much as the contents He doesnt bore those holes he makeshe
dissolves them

They sent Bowman back to quarters for a hot bath and a shot of HappyO
and looked up Hrunta the biochemist

Hrunta was glaring at paper electrophoretic patterns and pulling out
chunks of hair around his bald spot He gave them a snarl and shoved a
sheaf of papers into their hands

Metabolic survey Jenkins asked

Plus said Hrunta Youre not going to like it either

Why not If it grows it metabolizes If it metabolizes we can kill
it Axiom number seventeen paragraph number four

Oh it metabolizes all right but youd better find yourself another
axiom pretty quick

Why

Because it not only metabolizes it consumes Theres no sign of the
usual proteincarbohydratefat metabolism going on here This baby has
an enzyme system thats straight from hell It bypasses the usual
metabolic activities that produce heat and energy and gets right down to
basicbasic

Jenkins swallowed What do you mean

It attacks the nuclear structure of whatever matter the creature comes
in contact with Theres a partial massenergy conversion in its rawest
form The creature goes after carbonbearing substances first since the
C seems to break down more easily than anything elsehence its
preference for plant and animal material over nonC stuff But it can
use anything if it has to

Jenkins stared at the little biochemist an image in his mind of the
pink creature in the hold growing larger by the minute as it ate its
way through the hydroponics through the dry stores through

Is there anything it cant use

If there is I havent found it Hrunta said sadly In fact I cant
see any reason why it couldnt consume this ship and everything in it
right down to the last rivet

                                   

They walked down to the hold for another look at their uninvited guest
and almost wished they hadnt

It had reached the size of a small hippopotamus although the
resemblance ended there Twenty hours had elapsed since the survey had
begun The hlorg had used every minute of it draining the tanks
engulfing dry stores devouring walls and floors as it spread out in
search of food leaving trails of eroded metal wherever it went

It was uglyugly in its pink shapelessness ugly in its slimy
halfsentient movements in its very purposefulness But its ugliness
went even deeper stirring primordial feelings of revulsion and loathing
in their minds as they watched it oozing implacably across the hold to
another drystorage bin

Wally Stone shuddered Its grown

Too fast Bowman charts it as geometric progression

Stone scratched his jaw as a lone pink pseudopod pushed out on the floor
toward him Then he leaped forward and stamped on it severing the
strand from the body

The severed member quivered and lay still for a moment Then it flowed
back to rejoin the body with a wet gurgle

Stone looked at his halfdissolved shoe

Egotropism Jenkins said Bowman played around with that too A
severed piece will rejoin if it can If it cant it just takes up
independent residence and we have two hlorgs

What happens to it outside the ship Stone wanted to know

It falls dormant for several hours and then splits up into a thousand
independent chunks One of the boys spent half of yesterday out there
gathering them up I tell you this thing is equipped to survive

So are we said Green Doctor Stone grimly If we cant outwit this
freeflowing gob of obscenity we deserve anything we get Lets have a
conference

They met in the pilot room The Black Doctor was there so were Bowman
and Hrunta Chambers the physiologist was glumly clasping and
unclasping his hands in a corner The geneticist Piccione drew symbols
on a scratch pad and stared blankly at the wall

Jenkins was saying Of course these are only preliminary reports but
they serve to outline the problem This is not just an annoyance any
longer its a crisis Wed all better understand that

The Black Doctor cut him off with a wave of his hand and glowered at
the papers as he read them through minutely As he sat hunched at the
desk with the black cowl of his office hanging down from his shoulders
he looked like a squat black judge Jenkins thought a shadow from the
Inquisition a Passer of Spells But there was no medievalism in Black
Doctor Neelsen In fact it was for that reason and only that reason
that the Black Service had come to be the leaders and the whips the
executors and directors of all the manifold operations of Hospital
Earth

                                   

The physicians of the General Practice Patrol were fledglings newly
trained in their specialties inexperienced in the rigorous discipline
of medicine that was required of the directors of permanent Planetary
Dispensaries in the heavily populated systems of the Galaxy On outlying
worlds where little was known of the ways of medicine the temptation
was great to substitute faith for knowledge cant for investigation
nonsense rituals for hard work But the physicians of the Black Service
were always waiting to jerk wandering neophytes back to the scientific
disciplines that made the service of Hospital Earth so effective The
Black Doctors would not tolerate sloppiness Show me the tissue
Doctor they would say Prove to me that what you say is so Prove
that what you did was valid medicine Their laboratories were the
morgues and autopsy rooms of a thousand planets the Temples of Truth
from which no physician since the days of Pasteur and Lister could
escape for long and retain his position

The Black Doctors were the pragmatists the gadflies of Hospital Earth

For this reason it was surprising to hear Black Doctor Neelsen saying
Perhaps we are being too scientific just now When the creature has
exhausted our food stores it will look elsewhere for food Perhaps we
must cut at the tree and not at the root

A frontal attack said Jenkins

Just so Its enzyme system is its vulnerability Enzyme systems operate
under specific optimum conditions right And every known enzyme system
can be inactivated by adverse conditions of one sort or another A
physical approach may tell us how in this case Meanwhile we will be on
emergency rations and hope that we dont starve to death finding out
The Black Doctor paused looking at the men around him And in case you
are thinking of enlisting help from outside forget it Ive sent
plaguewarnings out for Galactic relay We have this thing isolated and
were going to keep it that way as long as I command this ship

They went gloomily back to their laboratories to plan their frontal
attack

That was the night that Hrunta disappeared

                                   

He was gone when they came to wake him from his sleep period His bunk
had been slept in but he wasnt in it In fact he wasnt anywhere on
the ship

But he couldnt just vanish the Black Doctor burst out when they told
him the news Maybe hes hiding somewhere Maybe this business was
working on his mind

Green Doctor Stone took a crew of men to search the ship again even
though he considered it a waste of precious time He had his private
convictions about where Hrunta had gone

So did every other man on the ship including Jenkins

The hlorg had stopped eating Huge and round and wet and ugly it
squatted in the afterhold quivering gently without any other sign of
life

Surfeited Like a fat man after a turkey dinner

Jenkins reviewed progress with the others No stone had been left
unturned They had sliced the hlorg and squeezed it They had boiled
it and frozen it They had dropped chunks of it in acid vats and covered
other chunks with desiccants and alkalis Nothing seemed to bother it

A cold environment slowed down its activity true but it also
stimulated the process of fission Warmed up again the portions sucked
back together again and resumed eating

Heat was a little more effective but not much It stunned the creature
for a brief period but it would not burn It hissed frightfully and
gave off an overpowering stench and curled up at the edges but as soon
as the heat was turned off it began to recover

In Hruntas lab chunks of the hlorg sat in a dozen vats on tables and
in sinks Some contained antibiotics some concentrated acids some
desiccants In each vat a blob of pink protoplasm wiggled happily
showing no sign of discomfiture On another table were the remains of
Hruntas unsuccessful attempt to prepare an antihlorg serum

But no Hrunta

He was down there with the thing all day Bowman said sadly He felt
it was his responsibility really Hrunta thought biochemistry was the
answer to all things of course Very conscientious man

But he was in bed

He claimed he did his best thinking in bed Maybe he had a brainstorm
and went down to try it out and

Yes Jenkins nodded sourly And He walked down the row of vats
Youd think that at least concentrated sulphuric would dessicate it a
little But its just formed a crust of coagulated protein around
itself and sits there

Bowman peered over his shoulder his mustache twitching But it does
dessicate

If you use enough long enough

How about concentrated hydrochloric

Same thing Maybe a little more effective but not enough to count

Okay Next we try combinations Theres got to be something the
wretched beast cant tolerate

There was of course

                                   

Green Doctor Stone brought it to Jenkins as he was getting ready to turn
in for a sleep period Jenkins had checked to make sure double guards
were posted in the hlorgs vicinity and jolted them with SleepNot to
keep them on their toes All the same he tied a length of stout cord
around his ankle just to make sure he didnt do any sleepwalking He was
tying it to the bunk when Stone came in with a pan in his hand and a
peculiar look on his face

Take a look at this he said

Jenkins looked at the sickly brown mass in the tray and then up at
Stone Where did you find it

Down in the hold Our hlorg has broken precedent Its rejected
something that it ate

Yeah What is it

I dont know Im taking it to Neelsen for paraffin sections But I
know what it looks like to me

Mm I know Jenkins felt sick Stone headed up to the path lab
leaving the Red Doctor settled in his bunk

Ten minutes later Jenkins sat bolt upright in the darkness Frantically
he untied himself and slid into his clothes Idiot he growled to
himself Seventh son of a seventh son

Five minutes later he was staring at the vats in Hruntas laboratory He
found the one he was looking for A pink blob of hlorg wiggled slowly
around the bottom

Jenkins drew a beaker of distilled water and added it to the fluid in
the vat It hissed and sputtered and sent up quantities of acrid steam
When the steam had cleared away Jenkins peered in eagerly

The pink thing in the bottom was turning a sickly violet It had quit
wiggling As Jenkins watched the violet color changed to mud grey then
to black He prodded it with a stirring rod There was no response

With a whoop Jenkins buzzed Bowman and Stone Weve got it he shouted
to them when they appeared Look Look at it

Bowman poked and probed and broke into a wide grin The piece of hlorg
was truly and sincerely dead It inactivates the enzyme system and
renders the base protoplasm vulnerable to anything that normally attacks
it What are we waiting for

They began tearing the laboratory apart searching for the right
bottles The supply was discouragingly small but there was some in
stock The three of them raced down the corridor for the hold where the
hlorg was

It took them three hours of angry work to exhaust the supply They
whittled chunks off the hlorg tossed them in pans of the deadly
fluid With each slice they stopped momentarily to watch it turn violet
then black as it died The hlorg dwindling in size sensed the
attack and slapped frantically at their ankles sending out angry plumes
of wet jelly but they ducked and dodged and whittled some more The
hlorg quivered and gurgled and wept pinkish goo all over the floor
but it grew smaller and weaker with every whack

Hrunta must have spotted it and come down here alone Jenkins panted
between slices Maybe he slipped lost his footing I dont know

They continued to work until the supply was exhausted They had reduced
the hlorg to a quarter its previous size Check the other labs see
if they have some more said Stone

I already have Bowman said They dont This is it

But we havent got it all killed Theres still He pointed to the
thing quailing in the corner

I know Were licked thats all There isnt any more of the stuff on
the ship

They stopped and looked at each other suddenly Then Jenkins said Oh
yes there is

There was silence Bowman looked at Stone and Stone looked at Bowman
They both looked at Jenkins Oh no Sorry I decline Stone shook his
head slowly

But we have to Theres no other way If the enzyme system is
inactivated its just protoplasmtheres no physiological or
biochemical reason

You know what you can do with your physiology and biochemistry Bowman
said succinctly You can also count me out He left them and the
hatchway clanged after him

Wally

Yeah

Itll be months before we get back to Hospital Earth We know how we
can hold it in check until we get there

Yeah

Well

Green Doctor Wally Stone sighed Greater love hath no man he said
wearily Wed better go tell Neelsen I guess

                                   

Black Doctor Turvold Neelsens answer was a flat unequivocal no Its
monstrous and preposterous I wont stand for it Nobody will stand for
it

But you have the proof in your own hands Jenkins said You saw the
specimen that the Green Doctor brought you

Neelsen hunched back angrily I saw it

And your impression of it As a pathologist

I fail to see how my impression applies one way or the other

Doctor sometimes we have to face facts Remember

All right Neelsen seemed to curl up into himself still further The
specimen was stomach

Human stomach

Human stomach

But the only human on this ship that doesnt have a stomach is Hrunta
said Jenkins

So the hlorg ate him

Most of him Not quite all It threw out the one part of him it
couldnt eat The part containing a substance that inactivated its
enzyme system Dilute hydrochloric acid to be specific We used the
entire ships supply and cut the hlorg down to threequarters size
but we need a continuous supply to keep it whittled down until we get
home And theres only one good permanent reliable source of dilute
hydrochloric acid on board this ship

The Black Doctors face was purple I said no he choked My answer
stands

The Red Doctor sighed and turned to Green Doctor Stone All right
Wally he said

                                   

From the files of the Medical Disciplinary Board Hospital Earth op
cit

I am certain that you can see from the foregoing that a reasonable
effort was made by Green Doctor Stone and myself to put the plan in
effect peaceably and with full approval of our commander It was our
conviction however that the emergency nature of the circumstances
required that it be done with or without his approval Our subsequent
success in containing the hlorg to at least reasonable and manageable
proportions should bear out the wisdom of our decision

Actually it has not been as bad as one might think It has been
necessary to confine the crew to their quarters and to restrain the
Black Doctor forcibly but with liberal use of HappyO we can
occasionally convince ourselves that it is rare beefsteak and the Green
Doctor our protem cook has concocted several very tasty sauces such
as mushroom onion etc We reduce the hlorg to half its size each
day and if thoroughly heated the chunks lie still on the plate for
quite some time

No physical ill effects have been noted and the period of quarantine is
recommended solely to allow the men an adequate period for psychological
recovery

I have only one further recommendation that the work team from the Grey
Service be recalled at once from their assignment on Mauki IV The
problem is decidedly not psychiatric and it would be one of the
tragedies of the ages if our excellent psychiatric service were to
succeed in persuading the Maukivi out of their delusion

After all Hospital Earth cannot afford to jeopardize a Contract
