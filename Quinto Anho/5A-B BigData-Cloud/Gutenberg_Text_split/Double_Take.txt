        DOUBLE TAKE

     By Richard Wilson

 Illustrated by Paul Orban


Paul Asher  mens furnishings buyer leaned back and let the cloth
band be fastened across his chest just under his armpits He adjusted
his heavy spectacles closed his eyes for a moment breathed deeply and
was off

The semidarkness was dispelled as he shot out of a tunnel into dazzling
sunlight The highpowered vehicle he was driving purred smoothly as it
took the long rising curve The road climbed steadily toward the
mountaintop city ahead He looked around to satisfy himself that he was
alone in the car

He wasnt

The girl was a pretty one Hed seen her somewhere before he thought
She was looking insolently at him her wide red mouth in a half smile
Her dark hair stirred in the breeze coming through the window next to
her which was open just a slit

She said Just keep going Sweetheart as fast as you can And she
patted the oversized pocketbook that lay in her lap

He pressed down on the accelerator and the car responded with a flow of
power The countryside fell away from the road on either side Far below
he could see a river winding broadly to the faroff sea The summer day
sent its heatshimmers across the miniature landscape

The road curved again Theirs was the only car he had seen since hed
come out of the tunnel But now far ahead he saw another It was
standing at the side of the road next to a gate that came down in the
manner of one at a railroad crossing But he knew by its black and white
diagonals and by the little sentry hut half hidden behind the other car
that it marked the frontier A man with a rifle on his shoulder stood
there They drew up to it fast but his foot automatically eased up on
the floorboard pedal until the girl spoke sharply

Right through it Sweetheart

In the rearview mirror he saw her leaning forward her face tense

In a moment it would be time to stop if he were going to

Paul Asher hesitated a moment Then he too leaned forward the band
pressing into his chest He was breathing heavily There was an almost
inaudible click

He trod on the accelerator He had a glimpse of the guard unslinging his
rifle from his shoulder and of another man running toward the parked car
as his vehicle smashed into the flimsy gate and sent it cracked and
splintered to the side of the road He fought the slight wrench of the
wheel and sped on He thought he heard a shot

Nice work the girl said She seemed to be appraising him as she
looked at him My name incidentally is Naomi

Hello he heard himself saying as he whipped the car around a curve
that hid the frontier behind a hill You seem to know who I am

That I do she said

Then why dont you call me by my name instead of Sweetheart

Thats because I like you Sweetheart She was looking out the rear
window Now just step on the gas because weve got company

The car that had been parked near the sentry hut was whipping into view
around the curve It was lighter than his but it was fast too He
stepped on it

                                   

Now the road had become narrow and twisting The grade was steep but the
surface was good Abruptly it entered a forest

The girl said Two more curves Then youll see a field and a barn Off
the road and into the barn fast

He took the curves with rubber screaming and almost without braking sent
the car bumping across the field and into the barn It was bigger than
it had seemed from the outside As he brought the car to a lurching halt
the barn door closed

Where he had expected to see stalls and milking machines and hay he saw
an expanse of metal floor and monstrous machinery The barn door which
had been a rickety wooden slab from the outside was a gleaming sheet of
metal from the inside It glided silently shut and left no joint or seam
to show where there had been an opening

Out said Naomi

As they left the car a flexible metal arm snaked from one of the smooth
walls attached itself to the front bumper of the vehicle and whisked
it into a cubicle which opened to receive it and closed behind it

A powerdriven wheelchair sped up to them Sitting in it was a fat man
of middle age with pendulous jowls and a totally bald head His
expression was a sardonic scowl

You have the plans he asked the girl

Sweetheart here has them

I dont know what youre talking about the young man said

He knows all right the girl said He pretends to be innocent but
that is merely his training He has them under a sticking plaster on
the small of his back

Remove your coat and shirt commanded the man in the wheelchair

At that moment the floor shuddered under their feet a gong began to
clang insistently and the giant machinery which had been silent
throbbed into life

The man in the wheelchair whirled and was off shouting commands to men
who materialized high on the walls in cylindrical turrets which the
visitor could only think of as battle stations

What is this place he asked

He got no answer Instead the girl grabbed his arm and pulled him off to
the edge of the gigantic metal room An opening appeared in the wall and
she pushed him through it into a room beyond The entranceway snapped
shut behind them and when he looked he could see no door The room also
was windowless

Naomi went to a metal table and as she looked down into its surface it
became a screen Mirrored in it was the mountainous countryside they had
driven through to get to the barnor what had seemed to be a barn from
the outside He looked over her shoulder

They saw as from a height There was the light car that had chased them
from the frontier Standing near it was a man in an officers uniform
and another in civilian clothes They were talking and gesturing Beside
the car was a tank As they watched its gun fired and the structure
they were in shuddered but they heard no sound

Lumbering up the mountain road were more tanks and a selfpropelled gun
One of the tanks became enveloped in smoke and flames as they watched
After a moment the smoke cleared The tank was gone where it had been
there was a deep crater

Gradually the figures in the drama below grew smaller At the same time
the vista widened so that they saw more and more countryside It
twisted beneath them and the horizon came giddily into view A few
moments later the curvature of the earth could be plainly seen

Everything fitted together at once Some of the things anyway

Were in a ship he said Some kind of rocketship

Its a planet plane the girl said Were safe now

Safe from what he asked Whats this all about

She smiled enigmatically Hafitz could tell you if he chose Hes the
boss

The man in the wheelchair

She nodded and took out a compact As she added lipstick to her mouth
she looked him over between glances in her mirror

You dont look like the spy type If there is a type

Im not a spy I dont know what youre talking about

The innocent Go on take off your coat and shirt Well save Hafitz
some time

Ill be glad to just to prove this is all ridiculous A case of
mistaken identity Youve made a mistake thats what youve done

He stood there hesitating

The girl gave a burst of laughter Then she said All right
Sweetheart Ill turn my back

She did and he pulled his shirt out of his trousers Then he froze
Taped to the skin of his back was a flat package

Paul Asher made the decision He bent forward feeling perspiration in
the palms of his hands There was a faint click

                                   

Quickly he ripped the adhesive from his back There was an instant of
pain as the plaster came free He wadded up the sticky package dropped
it to the floor and kicked it under the desk

Then he took off his coat tie and shirt

You can turn around now he said

A more modest spy Ive never seen Okay she said now you turn
around

As you see he said there are no plansno papers

Nonot now But there is a red mark on your back What is it

Oh he said Ohthats a birthmark

She spun him around to face her Her face was harsh She slapped his
cheek Where is the sticking plaster Dont trifle with me

Her eyes bored into his He returned the gaze then shrugged

Under the desk he said I tore it off and kicked it under the desk

You are sensible to confess she said

She bent down unwisely

Paul Asher felt the familiar tightening in his chest as he leaned
forward The click was barely heard

He raised his hand and brought the edge of it down hard on the back of
her neck

She crumpled and fell to the metal floor He noticed that a smear of her
freshlyapplied lipstick came off on it

He pushed the unconscious body aside and fished the packet out from
under the desk He searched the room for another hiding place

But it was too late A section of wall opened and Hafitz the fat man in
the wheelchair sped in

He wheeled past the young man looked briefly at the unconscious girl
then whisked himself around

You will pay for this my friend he said But first we will have the
plans for the waystation Where are they

I dont know anything about any plans and I dont know anything about a
waystation I tried to tell the girl its all a crazy mistake

We will see said Hafitz He pressed a button on the arm of his
wheelchair and two bruisers appeared through the walls in the abrupt
way people had of materializing here Bruisers was the only way they
could be described They were human brutes all muscle and malevolence

Take them said Hafitz indicating the unconscious girl and the young
man Take them and search them for a small packet If you do not find
it search this room If you do not find it still hurt the male animal
They persuade well with pain here I understand But do not kill him I
will be in the communications room

He sped off through a wall opening

One of the bruisers picked up the girl roughly and disappeared with
her The other grabbed the young man and hauled him off in a third
direction The young man hastily snatched up his coat shirt and tie en
route

They ended up in a cell of a room about seven feet in all directions
in which the bruiser stripped him methodically went through each piece
of clothing and then satisfied himself that he didnt have the packet
anywhere on his body

The muscleman then raised a fist

Wait his prospective victim said He thought back quickly Hafitz
didnt say you could bat me around till you searched the room too

The other spoke for the first time You say the truth He put his arm
down

The young man watched intently as the bruiser went through the wall of
the celllike room

He dressed fast By placing his fingers in exactly the same position as
the other had done was able to make the wall open for him

The silvermetal corridor had two directions He went to the right
After many turnings at each of which he reconnoitered carefully he
came to a passageway that was damp Why it was damp he couldnt tell
but there in the wetness were tracks which could have been made by a
wheelchair

He followed them feeling the throb of giant engines underfoot

                                   

The wheelchair tracks abruptly made a ninetydegree turn and ended at a
blank wall Somewhere beyond it must be the communications room

He retreated and waited

In time the wall snapped open and Hafitz sped out The young man
retreated into the maze of corridors and hoped chance would be on his
side It was Hafitz went another way

The young man ran back to the wall and used his fingers on it in the
combination he had learned It opened for him

He closed it behind him and blinked at the huge instrument panel which
filled almost the entire room

One of the instruments was a color vision screen tuned in to a room in
which there was a mahogany desk at which was seated a man in uniform
Behind him was a map of the United States

The man in uniform was a major general in the Air Force An aide a
lieutenant colonel was leaning over the desk He had a sheaf of papers
in his hand The mens conversation was audible

Messages have been coming in from all over Europe the colonel was
saying Heres the way it reconstructs

Our agent was en route to the rendezvous when he was intercepted by
Naomi Thats the only name we have for her Shes a spy Shes worked
for half a dozen countries and her present employer could be any one of
them They were spotted as they crossed the frontier between Italy and
France Their car went into a barn and we thought we had them But the
barn turned out to be a spaceship in disguise It took off

So Im their agent Paul Asher thought So thats what its all about
Im a secret agent for the United States but they didnt tell me
anything about it This is real George this is  He expected to hear
a faint click and leaned forward experimentally but nothing happened
He leaned backward Still nothing

The colonel was answering a question from the general We dont know
who they are Sir Theyre not from Earth obviously And the best
scientific minds go still furthertheyre not even from our solar
system Whoever they are its clear that they dont want us to build a
waystation in space

Those spaceships started buzzing around right after our first Moon
trip the general said This is the first time theyve become really
troublesomenow that weve got the Moon under control and are ready to
build the waystation so we can get to Mars

Thats right Sir said the colonel

Progress is a wonderful thing said the general Things certainly
have changed since those early days of strategic atomic bombing and
guided missile experiments

Yes Sir said the colonel

The young man in the communications room of the spaceship let his
attention wander away from the scene back on Earth and experimented with
some of the switches and controls Trial and error led him to one which
lit up a signal on the desk of the general

The general flicked it on

Yes he said He looked puzzled when he got no picture just a voice
saying Hello hello

Yes he said Hello Speak up man

This is your agent aboard the enemy spaceship said the young man Do
you read me

Yes said the general We read you Go ahead

I may not have much time Get a fix on me if you can And send help

Whats your position the general was reacting well He was alert and
all business

I dont know Ive been taken prisoner but Im temporarily free There
isnt much time Hafitz is bound to be back soon He seems to be the
brains of this outfitthis part of the outfit anyway Naomi is here
too but I dont know whether shes with them or against them

Where are the plans son asked the general

Theyre safe for the moment I cant guarantee for how long

Im getting the fix the colonel said He was beyond the range of the
young mans vision screen Ive got him Hes still within range but
accelerating fast We can intercept if we get up a rocket soon enough

Get it up ordered the general Get up a squadron Scramble the Moon
patrol and send out reserves from Earth at once

Right said the colonel

The young man was so engrossed in the makings of his rescue party that
he didnt see the wall open up behind him

There was a squeak of rubber tires and he whirled to see Hafitz in his
wheelchair slamming toward him The fat mans hand held a weirdlooking
gun

The young man recoiled His back pushed against a row of control
buttons

Then everything went white

                                   

Paul Asher blinked his eyes like a man awakening from a vivid dream

The house lights went on and the manager of the theater came on the
stage He stood in front of the blank master screen with its
checkerboard pattern of smaller screens on which the several lines of
action had taken place simultaneously Paul took off his selectorscope
spectacles with the earphone attachments

Ladies and gentlemen the manager said I regret very much having to
announce that this vicarion of the production Spies from Space was
defective The multifilm has broken and because of the complexity of
the vikie process it will be impossible to splice it without returning
it to the laboratory

Ushers are at the exits with passes good for any future performance
Those of you who prefer can exchange them at the box office for a full
refund of your admission price

Paul Asher unstrapped the wired canvas band from across his chest He
put the selectorscope spectacles into the pouch on the arm of the seat
and walked out of the RKO Vicarion into High Street and around the
corner to where his car was parked

His roommate at the communapt MacCloy was still up when he got there
going over some projectos Mac snapped off the screen and quickly swept
the slides together and into a case

Youre back early MacCloy said

The multifilm broke Paul told him

Oh Mac seemed abstracted as he often did and again Paul wondered
about this man he knew so casually and who had never confided in him
about anythingespecially about his government job

So I missed the ending Paul said I guess it was near the end
anyhow The space patrol was on the way but the villain that Hafitz
was just about to blast me with his gun and I dont know how I would
have got out of that

I remember that Mac said He laughed You must have been Positive
all the way through Like I was when I saw it If youd had any negative
reactionsif youd leaned back against the strap instead of
forwardyoud have been at some other point in the multiplot and I
wouldnt have recognized that part Want me to tell you how it ends

Go ahead Then if I do see it again Ill change the ending somewhere
along the line with a leanback

Okay There really wasnt much more It takes so much film to provide
all the plot choices that they cant make them very long

Well Hafitz blasts me and misses Mac went on or blasts you and
misses to keep it in your viewpoint When you jump back you set off a
bunch of controls That was the control room too not just the
communications room Well those controls you lean back against take the
ship out of automatic pilot and send it into some wild acrobatics and
thats why Hafitz misses Also it knocks him out of the wheelchair so
hes helpless and you get his gun Also you see that the plans are still
thereright where you put them stuck to the bottom of his wheelchair

So that was it said Paul

Yes said Mac And then you cover Hafitz while he straightens out the
ship and you rendezvous with the space control and they take you all
into custody You get a citation from the government Thats about it
Corny huh

But what about the girl Paul asked Is she really a spy

Girl What girl

Naomi her name was Paul said You couldnt miss her She was in the
vikie right at the beginningthat brunette in the fast car

But there wasnt any girl Paul Mac insisted Not when I saw it

Of course there was There had to bethe vikies all start out the same
way no matter who sees them

It beats me pal I know I didnt see her Maybe you dreamed up the
dame

I dont think so Paul said But of course its possible He yawned
I wouldnt mind dreaming of her tonight at that Think Ill turn in
now Mac Ive got that long trip tomorrow you know Up to Canada to
look over a new line of Marswool sport jackets at the AllPlanets
Showroom

Driving or flying

The weather prognosis is zerozero Ill drive

Good said Mac

                                   

Paul Asher woke up late He had a confused recollection of a dream
Something about a beautiful brunette giving him a backrub

A look at the chrono sent the dream out of his head and he hurried
through shaving and dressing

His car was waiting for him engine idling at the curb He got in
tossing his briefcase and topcoat ahead of him to the far side of the
front seat His back began to itch insistently and he rubbed it
against the leather upholstery

Paul adjusted the safety belt around him and fastened it Might as well
do it now instead of having to fool around with it later Damn that
itch anyway It was as if something were stuck to his skinlike a
sticking plaster

The highpowered vehicle purred smoothly as it took a long rising
curve The road climbed steadily toward the mountaintop city ahead

The scene was familiar

The itching of his back spread and became a prickly feeling in the small
hairs at the nape of his neck

He knew now that he was not alone in the car He looked in the rearview
mirror

Naomi

She was looking at him insolently her wide red mouth in a half smile

She said Just keep going Sweetheart as fast as you can


                                                            THE END
