 DEAD
 MANS
 PLANET

 By WILLIAM MORRISON

 Illustrated by EMSH


    When a driven man arrives at a cemetery world what else can it be
    but journeys endand the start of a new one


Outside the ship it was the sun that blazed angrily Inside it was Sam
Wilsons temper Study your lessons he snarled with a savageness
that surprised himself or Ill never let you set foot on this planet
at all

Okay Pop said Mark a little white around the nostrils He looked
old for so young a kid I didnt mean anything wrong

I dont care what you meant You do as youre told

In the quiet that followed broken only by the hum of the
arithmetictape Sam wondered at himself As kids went Mark had never
been a nuisance Certainly Rhoda had never had any trouble with him But
Rhoda had been altogether different Sam was tough and he had always got
a sense of satisfaction out of knowing that he was hardboiled Or at
least that was once true Rhoda had been sweet gentle

He aroused himself from thoughts of her by calling Mark

Yes Pop

His voice had been harsher than he had intended Over the past few weeks
he seemed gradually to have been losing control of it Now although he
was going to do his son a favor he sounded like a slavemaster
threatening a beating You can shut off your arithmetic lesson Were
going out

But didnt you want me

I changed my mind

Mark seemed more troubled than pleased as if a father who changed his
mind so readily was a man to be wary of

Im on edge all the time thought Sam and Im getting him that way
too Ill have to regain control of myself

                                   

He had long ago made all the necessary tests for such possible dangers
as lack of oxygen and the presence of infectious organisms On all
counts the planet had passed muster The sun whiter than Sol was
almost hot enough to make him forget the chill he carried deep inside
him Almost but not quite especially as the air though breathable
was thin and deficient in nitrogen The countryside was bleak inspiring
in him the thought that there are two kinds of desolation the one that
precedes the coming of Man and the one which he knows only too well how
to create wherever he goes The desolation here was nonhuman

Itits like a cemetery aint it Pop

Sam looked at his son sharply Kids of ten were not supposed to know
much about cemeteries Nor for that matter were kids of six Marks
age when the funeral had taken place Sam hadnt let him attend but
evidently the incident had made a deeper impression on his mind than Sam
had realized He would always remember a cemetery as the place where his
mother lived Perhaps he missed Rhoda almost as much as his father did

Its different from a cemetery said Sam Theres nobody buried here
Looks like were the first human beings ever to set foot on this place

Do you think well find animals to catch Pop

I dont see signs of any animals

That was part of Sams private fiction that he was looking for strange
animals to be sold to zoos or circuses Actually he was seeking less to
find anything new than to lose something he carried with him and
succeeding in neither attempt

Mark shivered in the sun Its kind of lonely he said

More lonely than the ship

Its different Its bigger so its more lonely

Im not so sure argued Sam mentally In the ship we have all of
space around us and nothings bigger than that Still your opinion has
to be respected Youre almost as great an expert on the various kinds
of loneliness as I am The difference is that youre loneliest when
youre away from people Im loneliest in a crowd Thats why I dont
mind this planet so much

He walked ahead Mark following almost reluctantly The ground was rocky
and the shrublike vegetation sparse and stunted ranging in color from
greenish gray to brown It seemed hardly capable of supporting a large
animal population If there were any animals here at all they were
probably too small to be impressive and would be of little interest to
exhibitors

They walked in silence for a few moments and then Sam asked Want to
go on

I want to finish my studying

That was something new Okay said Sam and turned back

                                   

They were approaching the ship when the sound of a pebble falling came
to Sams ears Automatically his hand reached for his gun and he swung
around to face what might be danger As he did so something snarled and
fled He could see no sign of motion but he could hear the scattering
of other pebbles along a gully as the creature retreated

Looks like were not alone here after all he said Wonder what that
was

It couldnt have been very big said Mark Big animals dont run
away

Not usually unless theyre smart or theyve met people before Ill
have to set traps

Do you think maybe if you caught him you could sell him to a circus
Pop

Ill have to see what hes like first said Sam He looked around
If theres one animal there are likely to be others Its strange that
I didnt detect any sign of them

He put his arm absently over Marks shoulder He didnt notice the
expression on the kids face at this unexpected gesture

Illustration

When they were inside the ship again Mark said Guess Id better get
back to my arithmetic

In a minute said Sam I want to talk to you first He dropped
wearily into a seat although he had done nothing that should have tired
him out His son looked at him expectantly Mark do you like traveling
around with me

Sure Pop I like to be with you

Not seeing anybody else No other kids no people of any kind Just
being with me learning your lessons from tapes and having your test
papers corrected automatically You dont get tired of it

Mark hesitated despite himself Then he said loyally Id rather be
with you than anybody else When Momwhen Mom diedI didnt want to
see anybody

I know how you felt But that was four years ago You cant grow up
alone Now what you need to do is meet people learn how they talk and
think and feel You cant learn those things from tapes and you cant
learn them from me

Mark said stubbornly I like to be with you

Im not much of a person to be with Dont think I dont know it Im
mean and surly and my tempers getting worse by the day I cant
associate with people any more But you can I was thinking maybe Id
leave you

No cried Mark

Not in an orphanage or anything like that But I have some friends
whose kids are growing up

No I wont go If you send me Ill run away I want to be with you

Okay said Sam Thats that

But it wasnt and he knew it Even as he went about preparing his
traps he knew it

                                   

As it turned out the only animals he caught in his traps were small
ones which tore themselves in two and then scampered off each half
running in a different direction For the animal which had made those
noises no traps were necessary Later on he heard a noise outside
again and he went out cautiously gun in hand The animal backed away
but he saw it then he heard it bark So did Mark who had followed him

Marks eyes almost popped It was four years since he had heard the
sound but he knew at once what it was Gosh A dog How do you spose
he got here

I dont know said Sam Your guess is as good as mine

But if were the first human beings to land hereit aint possible

I know that But there he is

At the sound of their voices the dog broke into a series of furious
barks backing away as it did so

What kind is he Pop

He looks like a mongrel to me A badtempered mediumsized mongrel
with an ugly look about him Maybe I ought to shoot him and get it over
with

Shoot him Dont do that I want him as a pet

He looks too wild to make much of a pet

The dog gave one last bark of defiance turned and fled in the same
general direction Sam noticed as he had run last time

Maybe dogs do grow on other planets Pop

Only if men have brought them there

Then that means there was a ship here

At some time or other there was a ship I dont think it was smashed
up or Id have seen wreckage when I cruised around before landing That
dog was either left here by mistake or deliberately marooned

Maybemaybe hes with somebody whos still here

Not likely said Sam thoughtfully He wanders around too freely and
he seems unused to the presence of human beings Besides no men would
be likely to live here long without shelter And Ive seen no sign of
any house or hut

Could he belong to a being that wasnt human

No replied Sam with certainty Only human beings have been able to
domesticate dogs If a dog is here a human being was once here Thats
definite

He would make a good pet said Mark longingly

Not that one Maybe I should have got you a dog long ago It might have
been just the kind of companionship you needed But you cant make a pet
of this animal Hes been away from people too long and hes developed
some mean habits And he added mentally Like me

I could train him said Mark He wouldnt be any trouble at all Pop
Id train him and feed him and hed be just like one of us Andand
like you say Pop it wouldnt be so lonely for me

Kids dont give up easily thought Sam All the same he had an idea
that with this dog all the persistence in the world would be useless He
shrugged and said simply Well see And then they went into the ship
to eat

                                   

All through the meal he could tell that Mark was thinking about the dog
The boys thoughts seemed to affect his appetite For the first time
he left some of his proteinex on the plate

Im not very hungry today he said apologetically Maybe He looked
inquiringly at his father

Go ahead and finish it said Sam Weve got plenty of food Ill fix
up something else for the dog

But I want to feed him myself Pop I want him to get used to me
feeding him

Ill give you your chance later

Afterwards Sam thriftily opened an old can of a less expensive variety
of proteinex and put half of it on a platter which Mark carried outside
the ship He moved off about a hundred yards in the direction the dog
had taken and set the platter down on a rock

The wind is blowing the wrong way said Sam Lets wait a while

                                   

In ten minutes the wind shifted and if the dog was near Sam felt
certain that he had picked up both their scent and that of the food
That his feeling was correct was shown by the sudden appearance of the
animal who barked again but this time not so fiercely And he stopped
barking to sniff hungrily at the same time keeping his distance

Here mutt called Mark

Im afraid he wont come any closer while were around said Sam If
you want him to have that food youd better go away from it

Mark reluctantly backed away with his father The dog approached the
food finally rushing down upon it as if he feared it would escape and
gobbled it

In the days that followed they continued to feed him and the animal
became relatively tame He stopped barking at them and at times let
Mark come within a few feet of him But he never allowed Mark to come
close enough to touch him and he was especially wary of Sam The latter
could see however that there was nothing around the smoothfurred
neck The collar if it had ever existed had evidently been worn away

So we cant find out what his name is said Mark in disappointment
Here Prince here Spot here Rover

The animal answered to none of the traditional dog names nor to several
of the newer ones that Mark recalled

After the dog had been with them for a half hour or so he usually
trotted off in the direction of what they had come to consider his
lair

He doesnt seem to be getting tame enough for a pet said Sam Thats
one idea Im afraid youll have to give up

All he needs is a little more time said Mark Hes getting used to
me Then a sudden fear struck him and he added Youre not going to
leave here yet are you Pop I thought you wanted to catch some big
animals

There arent any other big animals replied Sam Just those small
ones who came apart in the traps and theyre not worth catching But
Ill stay This place is as good as any other I wont leave it yet

                                   

In fact the stay on the planet bleak as the place was seemed to be
less unpleasant than cruising aimlessly through space Mark had been
starved for companionship of someone besides his father and in a way
without making too many demands the dog was a companion Wondering
about the beast and trying to tame him gave them something with which to
occupy their minds It had been several days realized Sam since he had
last snapped at Mark

It had become quite certain now that there was no other human being
around The dogs eagerness for the food showed that no one else had
taken care of him for a long time Evidently he had been forced to feed
himself on the small and elusive native animals which he could run down

One of the things that puzzled Sam was the dogs obvious anxiety to
leave the neighborhood of the ship after a short period and return to
his lair And one day driven by curiosity Sam followed him with Mark
coming along too

The dog had become sufficiently accustomed to them by now not to resent
their presence and it was easy to keep him in sight He led the way for
at least two miles over rocky ground and past a small stream Quite
unexpectedly he stopped and began to whine and sniff the ground As Sam
and Mark approached he turned on them barking furiously

The man and boy exchanged glances Hes acting just like he did in the
beginning said Mark

Theres something in the ground said Sam Im going to find out what
it is And he drew his gun

Youre not going to kill him Pop

Ill just put him to sleep An anaesthetic pellet of the kind I use for
trapping ought to do the trick

But one pellet turned out to be not enough It required the bursting of
three pellets before the animal finally trembled came to a halt and
with eyes glazed fell over on the ground

When they approached closer Sam caught sight of half a dozen stones
roughly piled together He said Better get back Mark This may not be
pleasant

You thinkyou think somebodys buried here

Very likely Im going to see

                                   

Using a flat rock with a sharp edge as an improvised spade he began to
dig The ground was hard and the rock was not the best of tools It
took him half an hour to reach the first bone and another halfhour to
uncover the rest

Mark had come up behind him and was watching with no sign of revulsion
He said II was afraid there might be a body Pop

So was I It looks as if the man died so long ago that everything else
has rotted away except for a few metal clasps No other sign of shoes
or clothes And no indication of how this happened

You think he was the dogs master

Evidently

They both stared at the sleeping animal Then Sam shrugged and began to
fill the shallow grave again Mark helped him push in the dirt and stamp
it down into place Finally they moved the stones back

They were about to leave when Mark cried out Look at that rock

Staring where his son pointed Sam saw a gray column about four feet
high with four smooth lateral sides Rectangular prisms of this size
were rare in nature This was obviously the work of human hands and of
a blasting rod as well to judge by the sides which showed evidence of
having been fused before weathering had cut into them At first he had
thought the column was a gravestone But there was no inscription upon
it There was nothing but a thin deep groove that ran horizontally
around the four sides several inches from the top

What does it mean Pop

Lets find out Its obviously been put here as some sort of memorial
As for this groove

He put his hands on the top of the stone and lifted As he had half
expected it separated at the horizontal groove The top of the stone
was the lid of a box Inside lay a plastic container

Some kind of plastic we dont make any more muttered Sam

Arent you going to open it asked Mark eagerly Maybe it tells about
the grave and the dogs name

The plastic came open at a slight tug Inside were several strong
sheets of paper Sam stared at them and said Its writing sure
enough But in some language I dont understand

We can put it in our mechanical translator said Mark That can tell
us what it means

Thats what well do

Arent we going to take the dog with us Pop

No well leave him here Hell come to in a little while

                                   

Walking back to their ship Mark continued to show an excitement that
was unusual for him You know what he said Ill bet were going to
learn what the dogs name is

I doubt if whoever wrote this thing would bother about a trifle like
that

But thats important Youll see Pop youll see

At the ship Sam inserted the sheets into the reader section of his
translator and started the motor The selector swung into action

Before it can translate it has to decide what language this is he
explained

Will that take long

A few minutes if were lucky a couple of hours if were not After
that I think the translation itself shouldnt take more than a few
minutes While were waiting we might as well eat

Im not hungry said Mark

Youd better eat anyway

Just a little bit maybe You know what I think Pop When I call the
dog by his name hell know Im his friend and hell come to me Then
hell really be my pet

Dont count too much on it said Sam And thought once more how lonely
his son must be to center so much hope in a halfwild beast

A light glowed suddenly in the translator The selector had found the
proper language Now it began to translate

Twenty minutes later its work had been completed As Sam silently began
to read Mark bumped against him knocking the translation from his
hand Sams first reaction was anger at the boys clumsiness Then he
became aware of the hope and the fear that lay behind Marks excitement
and bit back the angry words which had almost reached his lips

Easy Mark easy he said He picked up the translation again and sat
down You can read it over my shoulder if you want to

I just want to find out the dogs name

The important thing is his masters name Julian Hagstrom it says And
he was on a spaceship with his brother Raoul

Marks eyes had skipped ahead Look Pop heres the dogs nameArkem
I never heard of a dog having a name like that What does it mean

I wouldnt know muttered Sam absently still reading

But Mark wasnt actually interested in his answer He ran outside
Arkem he called Arkem

There was nothing he could interpret as an answer After a moment or two
he came into the ship again his face betraying his disappointment I
guess he doesnt hear me Hes too far away

Sam nodded He had put the translation down and was staring straight
ahead of him as if looking through the ships side

Is anything the matter Pop

What Oh no nothings the matter I was just thinking about what I
read here

They had an accident didnt they How did it happen

                                   

It happened because their ship wasnt as good as ours Julian Hagstrom
the man who was killed was buried here by his brother Raoul put this
record in the stone to mark his grave I think he also engraved
something on the stone itself But thats been worn away

It must have been a long time ago Maybe years

Yes it was years ago After he buried Julian Raoul tried to make
repairs and headed in a direction where he hoped hed find a civilized
planet He never made it

How can you know that He wrote the paper before he started out

If he had made it wed have heard of him Wed certainly have heard of
him Sams face was bleak And Rhodayour motherwould still be
alive

Mark looked puzzled and stared at the translation once more It says
here he tried to rereverse the aging process What does that mean And
whats immortality Pop

Something he and his brother were looking for Something to keep people
from ever dying They had a ship full of dogs and other animals All
died in their experimentsall but Arkem They had high hopes of Arkem
He lived through a number of different treatments and became quite a pet
of Julians Then came the crash Their method wasnt proof against
accidental death and at any rate they hadnt applied it yet to
themselves

After Raoul buried his brother the dog was miserable and howled so
much that Raoul decided to leave him behind He was helped to reach this
decision by the fact that the ship had lost much of its air in the
accident and he knew that the airpurifying mechanism wasnt working
too well He figured hed have a better chance of surviving if he stayed
in the ship alone But it didnt do him any good He was lost in space
or wed certainly have heard of him

From outside there came the sound of a low growl Its Arkem cried
Mark Now youll see Wait till he hears me call his name

He ran out and Sam followed slowly Dont expect too much Mark he
said almost with pity

Mark didnt hear him Arkem he called Arkem Arkem

The dog was watchful keeping his distance and giving no sign of
recognition Sam put his arm around his sons shoulder

Arkem Arkem Here Arkem

The dog snarled

                                   

There were tears in the boys eyes He doesnt know his own name He
doesnt even know his own name Arkem

Its no use Mark hes forgotten he ever had a name Im afraid youd
better give up the idea of having him as a pet

But you cant forget your own name

You can in eight hundred years Yes Mark thats when all this
happened eight hundred years ago Thats why the language had to be
translated Arkem is immortal And during his long life hes forgotten
not only his name but the master for whose sake he was marooned here
If Julian Hagstrom were by some miracle to come back to life Im sure
the dog wouldnt remember him All he has is a vague but strong tie to
that heap of stones He no longer knows why hes protecting it Hes
been away from live human beings so long that his brain is little more
than a bundle of reflexes and instincts

Ill train him said Mark Sometimes you forget a thing at first but
it comes back to you later Hell remember his namehere Arkem

Its no use said Sam For eight hundred years hes been tied to that
heap of stones Hell never remember anything except that fact Ill get
you another dog for a pet

You mean were going back to Mars or Earth

Some place like that Some place where there are people Being alone in
space is no good for you

Oh no Pop you cant get rid of me like that

Im not trying to get rid of you said Sam Being alone in space is
no good for me either Im going with you

Gee are you sure You wont change your mind

The delighted but uncertain look on his sons face shook Sam He said
carefully I wont change my mind Ive decided that its possible to
have too much of a good thing If grief is a good thing

Suddenly for no reason that they could detect the dog barked at them
and backed away the fur rising in an angry ridge along his back

Couldnt we take him along anyway asked Mark I dont like to think
of him all alone here year after year

Hell be miserable here but hed be more miserable away from his heap
of dirt and stones Perhaps Mark didnt see as Sam pulled his gun
then let it slip back into place No Thats none of my business Maybe
hell be fortunate and have an accident

What did you say Pop

Nothing much Come along Mark Were heading for civilization

An hour later the ship rose into the air Through the blasting of the
rockets Sam thoughtimagined he decided was a better wordthat he
heard the long doleful whine of a creature whose mindless grief was
doomed to last for all eternity
