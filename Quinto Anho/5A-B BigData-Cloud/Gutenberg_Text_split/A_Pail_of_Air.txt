                The dark star passed bringing with it
                eternal night and turning history into
                incredible myth in a single generation


Pa had sent me out to get an extra pail of air Id just about scooped
it full and most of the warmth had leaked from my fingers when I saw
the thing

You know at first I thought it was a young lady Yes a beautiful
young ladys face all glowing in the dark and looking at me from the
fifth floor of the opposite apartment which hereabouts is the floor
just above the white blanket of frozen air Id never seen a live young
lady before except in the old magazinesSis is just a kid and Ma is
pretty sick and miserableand it gave me such a start that I dropped
the pail Who wouldnt knowing everyone on Earth was dead except Pa
and Ma and Sis and you

Even at that I dont suppose I should have been surprised We all
see things now and then Ma has some pretty bad ones to judge from
the way she bugs her eyes at nothing and just screams and screams and
huddles back against the blankets hanging around the Nest Pa says it
is natural we should react like that sometimes

When Id recovered the pail and could look again at the opposite
apartment I got an idea of what Ma might be feeling at those times
for I saw it wasnt a young lady at all but simply a lighta tiny
light that moved stealthily from window to window just as if one
of the cruel little stars had come down out of the airless sky to
investigate why the Earth had gone away from the Sun and maybe to hunt
down something to torment or terrify now that the Earth didnt have
the Suns protection

I tell you the thought of it gave me the creeps I just stood there
shaking and almost froze my feet and did frost my helmet so solid on
the inside that I couldnt have seen the light even if it had come out
of one of the windows to get me Then I had the wit to go back inside

Pretty soon I was feeling my familiar way through the thirty or so
blankets and rugs Pa has got hung around to slow down the escape of
air from the Nest and I wasnt quite so scared I began to hear the
tickticking of the clocks in the Nest and knew I was getting back
into air because theres no sound outside in the vacuum of course
But my mind was still crawly and uneasy as I pushed through the last
blanketsPas got them faced with aluminum foil to hold in the
heatand came into the Nest

                                   

Let me tell you about the Nest Its low and snug just room for the
four of us and our things The floor is covered with thick woolly
rugs Three of the sides are blankets and the blankets roofing it
touch Pas head He tells me its inside a much bigger room but Ive
never seen the real walls or ceiling

Against one of the blanketwalls is a big set of shelves with tools
and books and other stuff and on top of it a whole row of clocks Pas
very fussy about keeping them wound He says we must never forget time
and without a sun or moon that would be easy to do

The fourth wall has blankets all over except around the fireplace in
which there is a fire that must never go out It keeps us from freezing
and does a lot more besides One of us must always watch it Some of
the clocks are alarm and we can use them to remind us In the early
days there was only Ma to take turns with PaI think of that when she
gets difficultbut now theres me to help and Sis too

Its Pa who is the chief guardian of the fire though I always think
of him that way a tall man sitting crosslegged frowning anxiously
at the fire his lined face golden in its light and every so often
carefully placing on it a piece of coal from the big heap beside it Pa
tells me there used to be guardians of the fire sometimes in the very
old daysvestal virgins he calls themalthough there was unfrozen
air all around then and you didnt really need one

He was sitting just that way now though he got up quick to take the
pail from me and bawl me out for loiteringhed spotted my frozen
helmet right off That roused Ma and she joined in picking on me Shes
always trying to get the load off her feelings Pa explains He shut
her up pretty fast Sis let off a couple of silly squeals too

Pa handled the pail of air in a twist of cloth Now that it was inside
the Nest you could really feel its coldness It just seemed to suck
the heat out of everything Even the flames cringed away from it as Pa
put it down close by the fire

Yet its that glimmery white stuff in the pail that keeps us alive
It slowly melts and vanishes and refreshes the Nest and feeds the
fire The blankets keep it from escaping too fast Pad like to seal
the whole place but he cantbuildings too earthquaketwisted and
besides he has to leave the chimney open for smoke

Pa says air is tiny molecules that fly away like a flash if there isnt
something to stop them We have to watch sharp not to let the air run
low Pa always keeps a big reserve supply of it in buckets behind
the first blankets along with extra coal and cans of food and other
things such as pails of snow to melt for water We have to go way down
to the bottom floor for that stuff which is a mean trip and get it
through a door to outside

You see when the Earth got cold all the water in the air froze first
and made a blanket ten feet thick or so everywhere and then down on
top of that dropped the crystals of frozen air making another white
blanket sixty or seventy feet thick maybe

Of course all the parts of the air didnt freeze and snow down at the
same time

First to drop out was the carbon dioxidewhen youre shoveling for
water you have to make sure you dont go too high and get any of that
stuff mixed in for it would put you to sleep maybe for good and make
the fire go out Next theres the nitrogen which doesnt count one way
or the other though its the biggest part of the blanket On top of
that and easy to get at which is lucky for us theres the oxygen that
keeps us alive Pa says we live better than kings ever did breathing
pure oxygen but were used to it and dont notice Finally at the
very top theres a slick of liquid helium which is funny stuff
All of these gases in neat separate layers Like a pussy caffay Pa
laughingly says whatever that is

                                   

I was busting to tell them all about what Id seen and so as soon as
Id ducked out of my helmet and while I was still climbing out of my
suit I cut loose Right away Ma got nervous and began making eyes at
the entryslit in the blankets and wringing her hands togetherthe
hand where shed lost three fingers from frostbite inside the good one
as usual I could tell that Pa was annoyed at me scaring her and wanted
to explain it all away quickly yet could see I wasnt fooling

And you watched this light for some time son he asked when I
finished

I hadnt said anything about first thinking it was a young ladys face
Somehow that part embarrassed me

Long enough for it to pass five windows and go to the next floor

And it didnt look like stray electricity or crawling liquid or
starlight focused by a growing crystal or anything like that

He wasnt just making up those ideas Odd things happen in a world
thats about as cold as can be and just when you think matter
would be frozen dead it takes on a strange new life A slimy stuff
comes crawling toward the Nest just like an animal snuffing for
heatthats the liquid helium And once when I was little a bolt of
lightningnot even Pa could figure where it came fromhit the nearby
steeple and crawled up and down it for weeks until the glow finally
died

Not like anything I ever saw I told him

He stood for a moment frowning Then Ill go out with you and you
show it to me he said

Ma raised a howl at the idea of being left alone and Sis joined
in too but Pa quieted them We started climbing into our outside
clothesmine had been warming by the fire Pa made them They have
plastic headpieces that were once big doubleduty transparent food
cans but they keep heat and air in and can replace the air for a
little while long enough for our trips for water and coal and food and
so on

Ma started moaning again Ive always known there was something
outside there waiting to get us Ive felt it for yearssomething
thats part of the cold and hates all warmth and wants to destroy the
Nest Its been watching us all this time and now its coming after
us Itll get you and then come for me Dont go Harry

Pa had everything on but his helmet He knelt by the fireplace and
reached in and shook the long metal rod that goes up the chimney and
knocks off the ice that keeps trying to clog it Once a week he goes up
on the roof to check if its working all right Thats our worst trip
and Pa wont let me make it alone

Sis Pa said quietly come watch the fire Keep an eye on the air
too If it gets low or doesnt seem to be boiling fast enough fetch
another bucket from behind the blanket But mind your hands Use the
cloth to pick up the bucket

Sis quit helping Ma be frightened and came over and did as she was
told Ma quieted down pretty suddenly though her eyes were still kind
of wild as she watched Pa fix on his helmet tight and pick up a pail
and the two of us go out

                                   

Pa led the way and I took hold of his belt Its a funny thing Im not
afraid to go by myself but when Pas along I always want to hold on to
him Habit I guess and then theres no denying that this time I was a
bit scared

You see its this way We know that everything is dead out there Pa
heard the last radio voices fade away years ago and had seen some of
the last folks die who werent as lucky or wellprotected as us So we
knew that if there was something groping around out there it couldnt
be anything human or friendly

Besides that theres a feeling that comes with it always being night
cold night Pa says there used to be some of that feeling even in the
old days but then every morning the Sun would come and chase it away
I have to take his word for that not ever remembering the Sun as being
anything more than a big star You see I hadnt been born when the
dark star snatched us away from the Sun and by now its dragged us out
beyond the orbit of the planet Pluto Pa says and taking us farther
out all the time

I found myself wondering whether there mightnt be something on the
dark star that wanted us and if that was why it had captured the
Earth Just then we came to the end of the corridor and I followed Pa
out on the balcony

I dont know what the city looked like in the old days but now its
beautiful The starlight lets you see it pretty welltheres quite a
bit of light in those steady points speckling the blackness above Pa
says the stars used to twinkle once but that was because there was
air We are on a hill and the shimmery plain drops away from us and
then flattens out cut up into neat squares by the troughs that used to
be streets I sometimes make my mashed potatoes look like it before I
pour on the gravy

Some taller buildings push up out of the feathery plain topped
by rounded caps of air crystals like the fur hood Ma wears only
whiter On those buildings you can see the darker squares of windows
underlined by white dashes of air crystals Some of them are on a
slant for many of the buildings are pretty badly twisted by the quakes
and all the rest that happened when the dark star captured the Earth

Here and there a few icicles hang water icicles from the first days
of the cold other icicles of frozen air that melted on the roofs and
dripped and froze again Sometimes one of those icicles will catch the
light of a star and send it to you so brightly you think the star has
swooped into the city That was one of the things Pa had been thinking
of when I told him about the light but I had thought of it myself
first and known it wasnt so

He touched his helmet to mine so we could talk easier and he asked me
to point out the windows to him But there wasnt any light moving
around inside them now or anywhere else To my surprise Pa didnt
bawl me out and tell me Id been seeing things He looked all around
quite a while after filling his pail and just as we were going inside
he whipped around without warning as if to take some peeping thing
off guard

I could feel it too The old peace was gone There was something
lurking out there watching waiting getting ready

Inside he said to me touching helmets If you see something like
that again son dont tell the others Your Mas sort of nervous these
days and we owe her all the feeling of safety we can give her Onceit
was when your sister was bornI was ready to give up and die but your
Mother kept me trying Another time she kept the fire going a whole
week all by herself when I was sick Nursed me and took care of the two
of you too

                                   

You know that game we sometimes play sitting in a square in the Nest
tossing a ball around Courage is like a ball son A person can hold
it only so long and then hes got to toss it to someone else When
its tossed your way youve got to catch it and hold it tightand
hope therell be someone else to toss it to when you get tired of being
brave

His talking to me that way made me feel grownup and good But it
didnt wipe away the thing outside from the back of my mindor the
fact that Pa took it seriously

                                   

Its hard to hide your feelings about such a thing When we got back in
the Nest and took off our outside clothes Pa laughed about it all and
told them it was nothing and kidded me for having such an imagination
but his words fell flat He didnt convince Ma and Sis any more than
he did me It looked for a minute like we were all fumbling the
courageball Something had to be done and almost before I knew what
I was going to say I heard myself asking Pa to tell us about the old
days and how it all happened

He sometimes doesnt mind telling that story and Sis and I sure like
to listen to it and he got my idea So we were all settled around the
fire in a wink and Ma pushed up some cans to thaw for supper and Pa
began Before he did though I noticed him casually get a hammer from
the shelf and lay it down beside him

It was the same old story as alwaysI think I could recite the main
thread of it in my sleepthough Pa always puts in a new detail or two
and keeps improving it in spots

He told us how the Earth had been swinging around the Sun ever so
steady and warm and the people on it fixing to make money and wars and
have a good time and get power and treat each other right or wrong
when without warning there comes charging out of space this dead star
this burned out sun and upsets everything

You know I find it hard to believe in the way those people felt
any more than I can believe in the swarming number of them Imagine
people getting ready for the horrible sort of war they were cooking up
Wanting it even or at least wishing it were over so as to end their
nervousness As if all folks didnt have to hang together and pool
every bit of warmth just to keep alive And how can they have hoped to
end danger any more than we can hope to end the cold

Sometimes I think Pa exaggerates and makes things out too black Hes
cross with us once in a while and was probably cross with all those
folks Still some of the things I read in the old magazines sound
pretty wild He may be right

                                   

The dark star as Pa went on telling it rushed in pretty fast and
there wasnt much time to get ready At the beginning they tried
to keep it a secret from most people but then the truth came out
what with the earthquakes and floodsimagine oceans of unfrozen
waterand people seeing stars blotted out by something on a clear
night First off they thought it would hit the Sun and then they
thought it would hit the Earth There was even the start of a rush to
get to a place called China because people thought the star would hit
on the other side But then they found it wasnt going to hit either
side but was going to come very close to the Earth

Most of the other planets were on the other side of the Sun and didnt
get involved The Sun and the newcomer fought over the Earth for a
little whilepulling it this way and that like two dogs growling
over a bone Pa described it this timeand then the newcomer won and
carried us off The Sun got a consolation prize though At the last
minute he managed to hold on to the Moon

That was the time of the monster earthquakes and floods twenty times
worse than anything before It was also the time of the Big Jerk as Pa
calls it when all Earth got yanked suddenly just as Pa has done to
me once or twice grabbing me by the collar to do it when Ive been
sitting too far from the fire

You see the dark star was going through space faster than the Sun and
in the opposite direction and it had to wrench the world considerably
in order to take it away

The Big Jerk didnt last long It was over as soon as the Earth
was settled down in its new orbit around the dark star But it was
pretty terrible while it lasted Pa says that all sorts of cliffs and
buildings toppled oceans slopped over swamps and sandy deserts gave
great sliding surges that buried nearby lands Earth was almost jerked
out of its atmosphere blanket and the air got so thin in spots that
people keeled over and faintedthough of course at the same time
they were getting knocked down by the Big Jerk and maybe their bones
broke or skulls cracked

Weve often asked Pa how people acted during that time whether they
were scared or brave or crazy or stunned or all four but hes sort of
leery of the subject and he was again tonight He says he was mostly
too busy to notice

You see Pa and some scientist friends of his had figured out part of
what was going to happentheyd known wed get captured and our air
would freezeand theyd been working like mad to fix up a place with
airtight walls and doors and insulation against the cold and big
supplies of food and fuel and water and bottled air But the place
got smashed in the last earthquakes and all Pas friends were killed
then and in the Big Jerk So he had to start over and throw the Nest
together quick without any advantages just using any stuff he could
lay his hands on

I guess hes telling pretty much the truth when he says he didnt have
any time to keep an eye on how other folks behaved either then or
in the Big Freeze that followedfollowed very quick you know both
because the dark star was pulling us away very fast and because Earths
rotation had been slowed in the tugofwar so that the nights were ten
old nights long

Still Ive got an idea of some of the things that happened from the
frozen folk Ive seen a few of them in other rooms in our building
others clustered around the furnaces in the basements where we go for
coal

In one of the rooms an old man sits stiff in a chair with an arm and
a leg in splints In another a man and woman are huddled together in
a bed with heaps of covers over them You can just see their heads
peeking out close together And in another a beautiful young lady is
sitting with a pile of wraps huddled around her looking hopefully
toward the door as if waiting for someone who never came back with
warmth and food Theyre all still and stiff as statues of course but
just like life

Pa showed them to me once in quick winks of his flashlight when
he still had a fair supply of batteries and could afford to waste
a little light They scared me pretty bad and made my heart pound
especially the young lady

                                   

Now with Pa telling his story for the umpteenth time to take our minds
off another scare I got to thinking of the frozen folk again All of a
sudden I got an idea that scared me worse than anything yet You see
Id just remembered the face Id thought Id seen in the window Id
forgotten about that on account of trying to hide it from the others

What I asked myself if the frozen folk were coming to life What
if they were like the liquid helium that got a new lease on life
and started crawling toward the heat just when you thought its
molecules ought to freeze solid forever Or like the electricity that
moves endlessly when its just about as cold as that What if the
evergrowing cold with the temperature creeping down the last few
degrees to the last zero had mysteriously wakened the frozen folk to
lifenot warmblooded life but something icy and horrible

That was a worse idea than the one about something coming down from the
dark star to get us

Or maybe I thought both ideas might be true Something coming down
from the dark star and making the frozen folk move using them to do
its work That would fit with both things Id seenthe beautiful young
lady and the moving starlike light

The frozen folk with minds from the dark star behind their unwinking
eyes creeping crawling snuffing their way following the heat to the
Nest

I tell you that thought gave me a very bad turn and I wanted very
badly to tell the others my fears but I remembered what Pa had said
and clenched my teeth and didnt speak

We were all sitting very still Even the fire was burning silently
There was just the sound of Pas voice and the clocks

And then from beyond the blankets I thought I heard a tiny noise My
skin tightened all over me

Pa was telling about the early years in the Nest and had come to the
place where he philosophizes

So I asked myself then he said whats the use of going on Whats
the use of dragging it out for a few years Why prolong a doomed
existence of hard work and cold and loneliness The human race is done
The Earth is done Why not give up I asked myselfand all of a sudden
I got the answer

Again I heard the noise louder this time a kind of uncertain
shuffling tread coming closer I couldnt breathe

Lifes always been a business of working hard and fighting the cold
Pa was saying The earths always been a lonely place millions of
miles from the next planet And no matter how long the human race might
have lived the end would have come some night Those things dont
matter What matters is that life is good It has a lovely texture
like some rich cloth or fur or the petals of flowersyouve seen
pictures of those but I cant describe how they feelor the fires
glow It makes everything else worth while And thats as true for the
last man as the first

And still the steps kept shuffling closer It seemed to me that the
inmost blanket trembled and bulged a little Just as if they were
burned into my imagination I kept seeing those peering frozen eyes

So right then and there Pa went on and now I could tell that he
heard the steps too and was talking loud so we maybe wouldnt hear
them right then and there I told myself that I was going on as if
we had all eternity ahead of us Id have children and teach them all
I could Id get them to read books Id plan for the future try to
enlarge and seal the Nest Id do what I could to keep everything
beautiful and growing Id keep alive my feeling of wonder even at the
cold and the dark and the distant stars

But then the blanket actually did move and lift And there was a bright
light somewhere behind it Pas voice stopped and his eyes turned to
the widening slit and his hand went out until it touched and gripped
the handle of the hammer beside him

                                   

In through the blanket stepped the beautiful young lady She stood
there looking at us the strangest way and she carried something
bright and unwinking in her hand And two other faces peered over her
shouldersmens faces white and staring

Well my heart couldnt have been stopped for more than four or five
beats before I realized she was wearing a suit and helmet like Pas
homemade ones only fancier and that the men were tooand that the
frozen folk certainly wouldnt be wearing those Also I noticed that
the bright thing in her hand was just a kind of flashlight

The silence kept on while I swallowed hard a couple of times and after
that there was all sorts of jabbering and commotion

They were simply people you see We hadnt been the only ones to
survive wed just thought so for natural enough reasons These three
people had survived and quite a few others with them And when we
found out how theyd survived Pa let out the biggest whoop of joy

They were from Los Alamos and they were getting their heat and power
from atomic energy Just using the uranium and plutonium intended
for bombs they had enough to go on for thousands of years They had
a regular little airtight city with airlocks and all They even
generated electric light and grew plants and animals by it At this Pa
let out a second whoop waking Ma from her faint

But if we were flabbergasted at them they were doubleflabbergasted at
us

One of the men kept saying But its impossible I tell you You
cant maintain an air supply without hermetic sealing Its simply
impossible

That was after he had got his helmet off and was using our air
Meanwhile the young lady kept looking around at us as if we were
saints and telling us wed done something amazing and suddenly she
broke down and cried

Theyd been scouting around for survivors but they never expected to
find any in a place like this They had rocket ships at Los Alamos and
plenty of chemical fuel As for liquid oxygen all you had to do was
go out and shovel the air blanket at the top level So after theyd
got things going smoothly at Los Alamos which had taken years theyd
decided to make some trips to likely places where there might be other
survivors No good trying longdistance radio signals of course since
there was no atmosphere to carry them around the curve of the Earth

Well theyd found other colonies at Argonne and Brookhaven and way
around the world at Harwell and Tanna Tuva And now theyd been giving
our city a look not really expecting to find anything But they had an
instrument that noticed the faintest heat waves and it had told them
there was something warm down here so theyd landed to investigate
Of course we hadnt heard them land since there was no air to carry
the sound and theyd had to investigate around quite a while before
finding us Their instruments had given them a wrong steer and theyd
wasted some time in the building across the street

                                   

By now all five adults were talking like sixty Pa was demonstrating
to the men how he worked the fire and got rid of the ice in the chimney
and all that Ma had perked up wonderfully and was showing the young
lady her cooking and sewing stuff and even asking about how the women
dressed at Los Alamos The strangers marveled at everything and praised
it to the skies I could tell from the way they wrinkled their noses
that they found the Nest a bit smelly but they never mentioned that at
all and just asked bushels of questions

In fact there was so much talking and excitement that Pa forgot about
things and it wasnt until they were all getting groggy that he looked
and found the air had all boiled away in the pail He got another
bucket of air quick from behind the blankets Of course that started
them all laughing and jabbering again The newcomers even got a little
drunk They werent used to so much oxygen

Funny thing thoughI didnt do much talking at all and Sis hung on
to Ma all the time and hid her face when anybody looked at her I felt
pretty uncomfortable and disturbed myself even about the young lady
Glimpsing her outside there Id had all sorts of mushy thoughts but
now I was just embarrassed and scared of her even though she tried to
be nice as anything to me

I sort of wished theyd all quit crowding the Nest and let us be alone
and get our feelings straightened out

And when the newcomers began to talk about our all going to Los Alamos
as if that were taken for granted I could see that something of the
same feeling struck Pa and Ma too Pa got very silent all of a sudden
and Ma kept telling the young lady But I wouldnt know how to act
there and I havent any clothes

The strangers were puzzled like anything at first but then they got
the idea As Pa kept saying It just doesnt seem right to let this
fire go out

                                   

Well the strangers are gone but theyre coming back It hasnt been
decided yet just what will happen Maybe the Nest will be kept up as
what one of the strangers called a survival school Or maybe we will
join the pioneers who are going to try to establish a new colony at the
uranium mines at Great Slave Lake or in the Congo

Of course now that the strangers are gone Ive been thinking a
lot about Los Alamos and those other tremendous colonies I have a
hankering to see them for myself

You ask me Pa wants to see them too Hes been getting pretty
thoughtful watching Ma and Sis perk up

Its different now that we know others are alive he explains to me
Your mother doesnt feel so hopeless any more Neither do I for that
matter not having to carry the whole responsibility for keeping the
human race going so to speak It scares a person

I looked around at the blanket walls and the fire and the pails of air
boiling away and Ma and Sis sleeping in the warmth and the flickering
light

Its not going to be easy to leave the Nest I said wanting to cry
kind of Its so small and theres just the four of us I get scared
at the idea of big places and a lot of strangers

He nodded and put another piece of coal on the fire Then he looked at
the little pile and grinned suddenly and put a couple of handfuls on
just as if it was one of our birthdays or Christmas

Youll quickly get over that feeling son he said The trouble with
the world was that it kept getting smaller and smaller till it ended
with just the Nest Now itll be good to have a real huge world again
the way it was in the beginning

I guess hes right You think the beautiful young lady will wait for me
till I grow up Ill be twenty in only ten years
