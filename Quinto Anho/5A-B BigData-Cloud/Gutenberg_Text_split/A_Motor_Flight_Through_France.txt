A MOTORFLIGHT THROUGH FRANCE




PART I




I

BOULOGNE TO AMIENS


The motorcar has restored the romance of travel

Freeing us from all the compulsions and contacts of the railway
the bondage to fixed hours and the beaten track the approach to
each town through the area of ugliness and desolation created by the
railway itself it has given us back the wonder the adventure and the
novelty which enlivened the way of our posting grandparents Above
all these recovered pleasures must be ranked the delight of taking a
town unawares stealing on it by back ways and unchronicled paths and
surprising in it some intimate aspect of past time some silhouette
hidden for half a century or more by the ugly mask of railway
embankments and the iron bulk of a huge station Then the villages that
we missed and yearned for from the windows of the trainthe unseen
villages have been given back to usand nowhere could the importance
of the recovery have been more delightfully exemplified than on a May
afternoon in the PasdeCalais as we climbed the long ascent beyond
Boulogne on the road to Arras

It is a delightful country broken into wide waves of hill and
valley with hedgerows high and leafy enough to bear comparison
with the Kentish hedges among which our motor had left us a day or
two before and the villages the frequent smiling happilyplaced
villages will also meet successfully the more serious challenge of
their English rivalsmeet it on other grounds and in other ways with
paved marketplaces and clipped charmilles instead of gorsefringed
commons with soaring belfries instead of square church towers with
less of verdure but more perhaps of outlinecertainly of line

Illustration ARRAS HTEL DE VILLE

The country itselfso green so full and close in texture so
pleasantly diversified by clumps of woodland in the hollows and
by streams threading the great fields with lightall this too
has the English or perhaps the Flemish qualityfor the border is
close bywith the added beauty of reach and amplitude the deliberate
gradual flow of level spaces into distant slopes till the land breaks
in a long blue crest against the seaward horizon

There was much beauty of detail also in the smaller towns through
which we passed some of them highperched on ridges that raked the
open country with old houses stumbling down at picturesque angles from
the central marketplace others tucked in the hollows among orchards
and barns with the pleasant country industries reaching almost to the
doors of their churches In the little villages a deep delicious thatch
overhangs the plastered walls of cottages espaliered with peartrees
and ducks splash in ponds fringed with hawthorn and laburnum and
in the towns there is almost always some note of character of
distinctionthe gateway of a seventeenth century htel the triple
arch of a churchfront the spring of an old mossy apse the stucco and
black crossbeams of an ancient guildhouseand always the straight
limewalk squareclipped or trained en berceau with its sharp green
angles and sharp black shade acquiring a value positively architectural
against the high lights of the paved or gravelled place Everything
about this rich juicy land bathed in blond light is characteristically
Flemish even to the slowmoving eyes of the peasants the bursting
red cheeks of the children the drowsy grouping of the cattle in
flat pastures and at Hesdin we felt the architectural nearness of
the Low Countries in the presence of a fine townhall of the late
Renaissance with the peculiar movement of volutes and sculptured
ornamentlimestone against warm brickthat one associates with the
civic architecture of Belgium a fuller less sensitive line than the
French architect permits himself with more massiveness and exuberance
of detail

This part of France with its wide expanse of agricultural landscape
disciplined and cultivated to the last point of finish shows how
nature may be utilized to the utmost clod without losing its freshness
and naturalness In some regions of this supremely administered
country where space is more restricted or the fortunate accidents
of water and varying levels are lacking the minute excessive culture
the endless ranges of potager wall and the long lines of fruittrees
bordering straight interminable roads may produce in the American
traveller a reaction toward the unkempt a momentary feeling that
ragged roadsides and weedy fields have their artistic value But here
in northern France where agriculture has mated with poetry instead
of banishing it one understands the higher beauty of land developed
humanised brought into relation to life and history as compared with
the raw material with which the greater part of our own hemisphere is
still clothed In France everything speaks of long familiar intercourse
between the earth and its inhabitants every field has a name a
history a distinct place of its own in the village polity every
blade of grass is there by an old feudal right which has long since
dispossessed the worthless aboriginal weed

As we neared Arras the road lost its pleasant windings and ran straight
across a great plateau with an occasional long dip and ascent that
never deflected it from its purpose and the villages became rarer
as they always do on the high windswept plains of France Arras
however was full of compensations for the dullness of the approach a
charming old grey town with a great air of faded seventeenthcentury
opulence in which one would have liked to linger picking out details
of gateway and courtyard of sculptured masks and wroughtiron
balconiesif only a brief peep into the hotel had not so promptly
quenched the impulse to spend a night there

To Amiens therefore we passed on passing again toward sunset into a
more broken country with lights just beginning to gleam through the
windows of the charming duckpond villages and tall black crucifixes
rising ghostly at the crossroads and night was obliterating the
mighty silhouette of the cathedral as we came upon it at length by a
long descent

Illustration AMIENS WEST FRONT OF THE CATHEDRAL

It is always a loss to arrive in a strange town after dark and miss
those preliminary stages of acquaintance that are so much more likely
to be interesting in towns than in people but the deprivation is
partly atoned for by the sense of adventure with which next morning
one casts ones self upon the unknown There is no conjectural first
impression to be modified perhaps got rid of ones mind presents a
blank page for the town to write its name on

At Amiens the autograph consists of one big word the cathedral Other
fainter writing may come out when one has leisure to seek for it but
the predominance of those mighty characters leaves at first no time
to read between the lines And here it may be noted that out of Italy
it takes a town of exceptional strength of character to hold its own
against a cathedral In England the chapterhouse and the varied
groupings of semiecclesiastical buildings constituting the close
which seem to form a connecting link between town and cathedral do no
more in reality than enlarge the skirts of the monument about which
they are clustered and even at Winchester which has its college and
hospital to oppose to the predominance of the central pile there
is after all very little dispersal of interest so prodigious
so unparalleled as mere feats of human willpower are these vast
achievements of the Middle Ages In northern France where the great
cathedrals were of lay foundation and consequently sprang up alone
without the subordinate colony of monastic buildings of which the
close is a survivaland where as far as monuments of any importance
are concerned the architectural gap sometimes extends from Louis the
Saint to Louis the Fourteenththe ascendancy of the diocesan church
is necessarily even more marked Rouen alone perhaps opposes an
effectual defence to this concentration of interest will not for a
moment let itself be elbowed out of the way by the great buttresses
of its cathedral and at Bourgesbut Bourges and Rouen come later in
this itinerary and meanwhile here we are standing in a sharp shower
under a notaires doorway and looking across the little square at
the west front of Amiens

Well No wonder such a monument has silenced all competitors It would
take a mighty counterblast to make itself heard against the surge
and thunder of that cloud of witnesses choiring forth the glories of
the Church Triumphant Is the stage too crowded Is there a certain
sameness in the overarching tiers of the stone hierarchy each figure
set in precise alignment with its neighbours each drapery drawn within
the same perpendicular bounds Yes perhapsif one remembers Rheims
and Bourges but if setting aside such kindred associations one
surrenders ones self uncritically to the total impression produced if
one lets the fortunate accidents of time and weather count for their
full value in that totalfor Amiens remains mercifully unscrubbed and
its armies of saints have taken on the richest patina that northern
stone can acquireif one views the thing in short partly as a symbol
and partly as a work of nature which all ancient monuments by grace
of time become then the front of Amiens is surely one of the most
splendid spectacles that Gothic art can show

On the symbolic side especially it would be tempting to linger so
strongly does the contemplation of the great cathedrals fortify
the conviction that their chief value to this later age is not
so much sthetic as moral The world will doubtless always divide
itself into two orders of mind that which sees in past expressions
of faith political religious or intellectual only the bonds cast
off by the spirit of man in its long invincible struggle for more
light and that which while moved by the spectacle of the struggle
cherishes also every sign of those past limitations that were after
all each in its turn symbols of the same effort toward a clearer
vision To the former kind of mind the great Gothic cathedral will be
chiefly interesting as a work of art and a page of history and it
is perhaps proof of the advantage of cultivating the otherthe more
complexpoint of view in which enfranchisement of thought exists in
harmony with atavism of feeling that it permits one to appreciate
these archological values to the full yet subordinates them to
the more impressive facts of which they are the immense and moving
expression To such minds the rousing of the sense of reverence is
the supreme gift of these mighty records of medival life reverence
for the persistent slowmoving farreaching forces that brought them
forth A great Gothic cathedral sums up so much of history it has cost
so much in faith and toil in blood and folly and saintly abnegation
it has sheltered such a long succession of lives given collective
voice to so many inarticulate and contradictory cravings seen so much
that was sublime and terrible or foolish pitiful and grotesque
that it is like some mysteriously preserved ancestor of the human race
some Wandering Jew grown sedentary and throned in stony contemplation
before whom the fleeting generations come and go

Illustration AMIENS AMBULATORY OF THE CATHEDRAL

Yesreverence is the most precious emotion that such a building
inspires reverence for the accumulated experiences of the past
readiness to puzzle out their meaning unwillingness to disturb rashly
results so powerfully willed so laboriously arrived atthe desire
in short to keep intact as many links as possible between yesterday
and tomorrow to lose in the ardour of new experiment the least that
may be of the long rich heritage of human experience This at any
rate might seem to be the cathedrals word to the traveller from a
land which has undertaken to get on without the past or to regard it
only as a feature of sthetic interest a sight to which one travels
rather than a light by which one lives

The west front of Amiens says this word with a quite peculiar
emphasis its grand unity of structure and composition witnessing
as much to constancy of purpose as to persistence of effort So
steadily so clearly was this great thing willed and foreseen that
it holds the mind too deeply subject to its general conception to
be immediately free for the delighted investigation of detail But
within the building detail reasserts itself detail within detail
worked out and multiplied with a prodigality of enrichment for which
a counterpart must be sought beyond the Alps The interiors of the
great French cathedrals are as a rule somewhat gaunt and unfurnished
baring their structural nakedness sublimely but rather monotonously to
eyes accustomed to the Italian churches all glorious within Here
at Amiens however the inner decking of the shrine has been piously
continued from generation to generation and a quite extraordinary
wealth of adornment bestowed on the choir and its ambulatory The
great sculptured and painted frieze encircling the outer side of the
choir is especially surprising in a French church so seldom were
the stone histories lavished on the exterior continued within the
building and it is a farther surprise to find the same tales in
basrelief animating and enriching the west walls of the transepts
They are full of crowded expressive incidents these stories of local
saints and Scriptural personages with a Burgundian richness and
elaborateness of costume and a quite charming childish insistence
on irrelevant episode and detailthe reiterated And so And then
of the fairytale calling off ones attention into innumerable little
bypaths down which the fancy of fifteenthcentury worshippers
must have strayed with oh what blessedness of relief from the
unintelligible rites before the altar

Of composition there is none it is necessarily sacrificed to the
desire to stop and tell everything to show for instance in an
interesting parenthesis exactly what Herods white woolly dog was
about while Salome was dancing away the Baptists head And thus one is
brought back to the perpetually recurring fact that all northern art
is anecdotic and has always been so and that for instance all the
elaborate theories of dramatic construction worked out to explain why
Shakespeare crowded his stage with subordinate figures and unnecessary
incidents and would certainly in relating the story of Saint John
have included Herods Tray and Sweetheart among the dramatis
personthat such theories are but an unprofitable evasion of the
ancient ethnological fact that the Goth has always told his story in
that way

Illustration BEAUVAIS WEST FRONT OF THE CATHEDRAL

BEAUVAIS AND ROUEN


The same wonderful white road flinging itself in great coils and
arrowflights across the same spacious landscape swept us on the
next day to Beauvais If there seemed to be fewer memorable incidents
by the wayif the villages had less individual character over and
above their general charm of northern thrift and cosinessit was
perhaps because the first impression had lost its edge but we caught
fine distant reaches of field and orchard and wooded hillside giving
a general sense that it would be a good land to live intill all
these minor sensations were swallowed up and lost in the overwhelming
impression of Beauvais

The town itselfalmost purposely as we felt afterwardfailed to put
itself forward to arrest us by any of the minor arts which Arras
for instance had so seductively exerted It maintained an attitude
of calm aloofness of affected ignorance of the travellers object in
visiting itsuffering its little shuttered noncommittal streets to
lead us up tortuously to the drowsiest little provincial place
with the usual limearcades and the usual low houses across the way
where suddenly there soared before us the great mad broken dream
of Beauvais choirthe cathedral without a navethe Kubla Khan of
architecture

It seems in truth like some climax of mystic vision miraculously
caught in visible form and arrested broken off by the intrusion of
the Person from Porlockin this case no doubt the panicstricken
mason crying out to the entranced creator We simply cant keep
it up And because it literally couldnt be kept upas one or two
alarming collapses soon attestedit had to check there its great wave
of stone hold itself for ever back from breaking into the long ridge
of the nave and flying crests of buttress spire and finial It is
easy for the critic to point out its structural defects and to cite
them in illustration of the fact that your true artist never seeks to
wrest from their proper uses the materials in which he worksdoes
not for instance try to render metaphysical abstractions in stone
and glass and lead yet Beauvais has at least none of the ungainliness
of failure it is like a great hymn interrupted not one in which the
voices have flagged and to the desultory mind such attempts seem to
deserve a place among the fragmentary glories of great art It is at
any rate an example of what the Gothic spirit pushed to its logical
conclusion strove for the utterance of the unutterable and he who
condemns Beauvais has tacitly condemned the whole theory of art from
which it issued But shall we not have gained greatly in our enjoyment
of beauty as well as in serenity of spirit if instead of saying
this is good art or this is bad art we say this is classic and
that is Gothicthis transcendental that rationalusing neither
term as an epithet of opprobrium or restriction but content when
we have performed the act of discrimination to note what forms of
expression each tendency has worked out for itself

Beyond Beauvais the landscape became more deeply Normanmore thatched
and green and orchardsmotheredthough as far as the noting of
detail went we did not really get beyond Beauvais at all but
travelled on imprisoned in that tremendous memory till abruptly from
the crest of a hill we looked down a long green valley to Rouen
shining on its riverbelfries spires and great arched bridges
drenched with a golden sunset that seemed to shoot skyward from the
long illuminated reaches of the Seine I recall only two such magic
descents on famous towns that on Orvieto from the last hill of the
Viterbo road and the otherpitched in a minor key but full of a small
ancient majestythe view of Wells in its calm valley as the Bath road
gains the summit of the Mendip hills

Illustration ROUEN RUE DE LHORLOGE

The poetry of the descent to Rouen is unhappily dispelled by the
long approach through sordid interminable outskirts Orvieto and
Wells being less prosperous do not subject the traveller to this
descent into prose which leaves one reflecting mournfully on the
incompatibility under our present social system between prosperity
and beauty As for Rouen itself as one passes down its crowded
tramlined quays between the noisy unloading of ships and the clatter
of innumerable cafs one feels that the old Gothic town one used
to know cannot really exist any more must have been elbowed out of
place by these spreading commercial activities but it turns out to be
there after all holding almost intact behind the dull mask of modern
streets the surprise of its rich medivalism

Here indeed the traveller finds himself in no mere cathedral town
with one street leading to Saint Ouen another to Saint Maclou a third
to the beautiful Palais de Justice the cathedral itself has put forth
the appeal of all its accumulated treasures to make one take first
of all the turn to its doors There are few completer impressions in
Europe than that to be received as one enters the Lady Chapel of Rouen
where an almost Italian profusion of colour and ornament have been
suffered to accumulate slowly about its central ornamentthe typically
northern monument of the two Cardinals of Amboise There could hardly
be a better example of the sthetic wisdom of living and letting live
than is manifested by the happy way in which supposedly incompatible
artistic ideals have contrived to make bon mnage in this delicious
corner It is a miracle that they have been allowed to pursue their
happy experiment till now for there must have been moments when to
the purist of the Renaissance the Gothic tomb of the Cardinals seemed
unworthy to keep company with the Snchal de Brzs monument in
which the delicate note of classicalism reveals a France so profoundly
modified by Italy just as later the great Berniniesque altarpiece
with its twisted columns and exuberance of golden rays must have
narrowly escaped the axe of the Gothic reactionary But there they
all are blending their supposed discords in a more complex harmony
filling the privileged little edifice with an overlapping richness
of hue and line through which the eye perpetually passes back to the
central splendour of the Cardinals tomb

A magnificent monument it is opposing to the sober beauty of Germain
Pilons composition its insolence of varied detailthe this and
this and this of the loquacious medival craftsmanall bound
together by the pew constructive sense which has already learned
how to bring the topmost bud of the marble finials into definite
relation with the little hooded mourners bowed in such diversity of
grief in their niches below the tomb A magnificent monumentand
to my mind the finest thing about it is the Cardinal Uncles nose
The whole man is fine in his sober dignity humbly conscious of the
altar toward which he faces arrogantly aware of the purple on his
shoulders and the nose is the epitome of the man We live in the day
of little noses that once stately feature intrinsically feudal and
aristocratic in characterthe maschio naso extolled of Dantehas
shrunk to democratic insignificance like many another fine expression
of individualism And so one must look to the old painters and
sculptors to see what a nose was meant to bethe prow of the face
the evidence of its owners standing of his relation to the world
and his inheritance from the past Even in the profile of the Cardinal
Nephew kneeling a little way behind his uncle the gallant feature is
seen to have suffered a slight diminution its spring still bold is
less commanding it seems as it were to have thrust itself against
a less yielding element And so the deterioration has gone on from
generation to generation till the nose has worn itself blunt against
the increasing resistances of a democratic atmosphere and stunted
atrophied and amorphous serves only now to let us know when we have
the influenza

With the revisiting of the Cardinals nose the first object of our
visit to Rouen had been accomplished the second led us past objects
of far greater importance to the wellarranged but dull gallery where
Gerhard Davids Virgin of the Grapes is to be seen Every wanderer
through the world has these pious pilgrimages to perform generally to
shrines of no great notehow often for instance is one irresistibly
drawn back to the Transfiguration or to the Venus of Milobut to
lesser works first seen perhaps at a fortunate moment or having
some special quality of suggestion and evocation that the perfect
equilibrium of the masterpieces causes them to lack So I know of
some who go first to The Death of Procris in the National Gallery
to the little Apollo and Marsyas of the Salon Carr to a fantastic
allegorical picture subject and artist unknown in an obscure corner
of the Uffizi and who would travel more miles to see again in the
little gallery of Rimini an Entombment of the school of Mantegna than
to sit beneath the vault of the Sistine

Illustration ROUEN THE FAADE OF THE CHURCH OF SAINTMACLOU

All of which may seem to imply an unintentional disparagement of
Gerhard Davids picture which is after all a masterpiece of its
school but the school is a subordinate one and save to the student
of Flemish art his is not a loudsounding name one does not say for
instance with any hope of general recognitionAh yes that reminds
me of such and such a bit in The Virgin of the Grapes

All the more therefore may one enjoy his picture in the empty
room of the Rouen gallery with that gentle sense of superiority
and possessorship to which the discerner of obscure merit is surely
entitled How much of its charm this particular painting owes to its
not having become the picnicground of the artexcursionist how
much to its own intrinsic beauty its grave serenities of hue and
gesturehow much above all to the heavenly translucence of that
bunch of grapes plucked from the vines of Paradiseit is part of its
very charm to leave unsettled to keep among the mysteries whereby it
draws one back Only one trembles lest it should cease to shine in its
own twilight heaven when it has become a star in Baedeker

FROM ROUEN TO FONTAINEBLEAU


The Seine two days later by the sweetest curves drew us on from
Rouen to Les Andelys past such bright gardens terraced above its
banks such moist poplarfringed islands such low green promontories
deflecting its silver flow that we continually checked the flight of
the motor pausing here and here and here again to note how France
understands and enjoys and lives with her rivers

With her great past it seems she has partly ceased to live for
ask as we would we could not that morning learn the way to King
Richards Chteau Gaillard on the cliff above Les Andelys Every turn
from the route de Paris seemed to lead straight into the unknown
mais cest tout droit pour Paris was the invariable answer when we
asked our way Yet a few miles off were two of the quaintest towns
of Francethe Little and Great Andelysurmounted by a fortress
marking an epoch in military architecture and associated with the
fortunes of one of the most romantic figures in history and we
knew that if we clung to the windings of the Seine they must lead
us within a few miles to the place we sought And so having with
difficulty disentangled ourselves from the route de Paris we pushed
on by quiet byroads and unknown villages by manoirs of grey stone
peeping through high thickets of lilac and laburnum and along shady
riverreaches where fishermen dozed in their punts and cattle in the
meadowgrass beneath the willowstill the soft slopes broke abruptly
into tall cliffs shaggy with gorse and the easy flow of the river was
forced into a sharp twist at their base There is something fantastic
in this sudden change of landscape near Les Andelys from the familiar
French riverscenery to what might be one of Piero della Francescas
backgrounds of strangely fretted rock and scant black vegetation while
the Seine roused from its progress through yielding meadows takes a
majestic bend toward the Little Andely in the bay of the cliffs and
then sweeps out below the height on which CurdeLion planted his
subtly calculated bastions

Illustration ROUEN MONUMENT OF THE CARDINALS OF AMBOISE IN THE
CATHEDRAL

Ahpoor fluttering rag of a ruin so thin so timeworn so riddled
with storm and shell that it droops on its rock like a torn banner
with forgotten victories in its folds How much more eloquently these
tottering stones tell their story how much deeper into the past they
take us than the dapper weathertight castlesPierrefonds Langeais
and the reston which the archrestorer has worked his will reducing
them to mere museum specimens archological toys from which all
the growths of time have been ruthlessly stripped The eloquence of
the Chteau Gaillard lies indeed just therein its telling us so
discursively so plaintively the whole story of the centurieshow
long it has stood how much it has seen how far the world has
travelled since then and to what a hoarse cracked whisper the voice
of feudalism and chivalry has dwindled

The town that once cowered under the protection of those fallen
ramparts still groups its stout old houses about a church so grey
and venerable yet so sturdily planted on its ancient piers that
one might fancy its compassionately bidding the poor ghost of a
fortress come down and take shelter beneath its vaultings Commune and
castle they have changed places with the shifting fortunes of the
centuries the weak growth of the town outstripping the arrogant brief
bloom of the fortressRichards fair daughter of one yearwhich had
called it arbitrarily into being The fortress itself is now no more
than one of the stageproperties of the Muse of History but the town
poor little accidental offshoot of a military exigency has built up a
life for itself become an abiding centre of human activitiesthough
by an accident in which the traveller cannot but rejoice it still
keeps in spite of its sound masonry and air of ancient health that
almost unmodernised aspect which makes some little French burghs recall
the figure of a lively centenarian all his faculties still active but
wearing the dress of a former day

Regaining the route de Paris we passed once more into the normal Seine
landscape with smiling towns closeset on its shores with lilac
and wistaria pouring over high walls with bright little cafs on
sunny village squares with flotillas of pleasureboats moored under
willowshaded banks

Never more vividly than in this Seine country does one feel the amenity
of French manners the long process of social adaptation which has
produced so profound and general an intelligence of life Every one
we passed on our way from the canalboatman to the whitecapped
bakers lad from the marchande des quatre saisons to the white dog
curled philosophically under her cart from the pastrycook putting
a fresh plate of brioches in his appetising window to the curs
bonne who had just come out to drain the lettuce on the curs
doorstepall these persons under which designation I specifically
include the dog took their ease or pursued their business with that
cheerful activity which proceeds from an intelligent acceptance of
given conditions They each had their established niche in life the
frankly avowed interests and preoccupations of their order their pride
in the smartness of the canalboat the seductions of the showwindow
the glaze of the brioches the crispness of the lettuce And this
admirable fitting into the pattern which seems almost as if it were
a moral outcome of the universal French sense of form has led the race
to the happy the momentous discovery that good manners are a short
cut to ones goal that they lubricate the wheels of life instead of
obstructing them This discoverythe result as it strikes one of the
application of the finest of mental instruments to the muddled process
of livingseems to have illuminated not only the social relation but
its outward concrete expression producing a finish in the material
setting of life a kind of conformity in inanimate thingsforming
in short the background of the spectacle through which we pass the
canvas on which it is painted and expressing itself no less in the
trimness of each individual garden than in that insistence on civic
dignity and comeliness so miraculously maintained through every
torment of political passion every change of social conviction by a
people resolutely addressed to the intelligent enjoyment of living

By Vernon with its trim limewalks en berceau by Mantes with its
bright gardens and the graceful overrestored church which dominates
its square we passed on to Versailles forsaking the course of the
Seine that we might have a glimpse of the country about Fontainebleau

At the top of the route du Buc which climbs by sharp windings from
the Place du Chteau at Versailles one comes upon the arches of the
aqueduct of Bucone of the monuments of that splendid folly which
created the Golden House of Louis XIV and drew its miraculous
groves and gardens from the waterless plain of Versailles The
aqueduct forming part of the extravagant scheme of irrigation of which
the Machine de Marly and the great canal of Maintenon commemorate
successive disastrous phases frames in its useless lofty openings
such charming glimpses of the country to the southwest of Versailles
that it takes its place among those abortive architectural experiments
which seem after all to have been completely justified by time

Illustration LE PETIT ANDELY VIEW OF THE TOWN AND CHTEAU GAILLARD

The landscape upon which the arches look is a highlying region of
wood and vale with chteaux at the end of long green vistas and old
flowery villages tucked into folds of the hills At the first turn of
the road above Versailles the wellkept suburbanism of the Parisian
environ gives way to the real look of the countrywellkept and
smiling still but tranquil and sweetly shaded with big farmyards
quiet country lanes and a quiet country look in the peasants faces

In passing through some parts of France one wonders where the
inhabitants of the chteaux go when they emerge from their gatesso
interminably beyond those gates do the flat fields divided by
straight unshaded roads reach out to every point of the compass but
here the wooded undulations of the country the friendliness of the
villages the recurrence of big rambling farmsteadssome apparently
the remains of fortified monastic grangesall suggest the possibility
of something resembling the English rural life with its traditional
ties between park and fields

The brief journey between Versailles and Fontainebleau offersif
one takes the longer way by Saint RmylesChevreuse and Etampesa
succession of charming impressions more varied than one often finds in
a long days motorrun through France and midway one comes upon the
splendid surprise of Dourdan

Ignorance is not without its sthetic uses and to drop down into the
modest old town without knowingor having forgotten if one prefers
to put it sothe great castle of Philip Augustus which moated
dungeoned ivywalled still possesses its peaceful central squareto
come on this vigorous bit of medival arrogance with the little houses
of Dourdan still ducking their humble roofs to it in an obsequious
circlewell to taste the full flavour of such sensations it is worth
while to be of a country where the last new grainelevator or office
building is the only monument that receives homage from the surrounding
architecture

Dourdan too has the crowning charm of an old inn facing its
chteaufortsuch an inn as Manon and des Grieux dined in on the
way to Pariswhere in a large courtyard shaded by trees one may
feast on strawberries and cheese at a table enclosed in clipped shrubs
with dogs and pigeons amicably prowling for crumbs and the host and
hostess their maidservants ostlers and marmitons breakfasting at
another long table just across the hedge Now that the demands of
the motorist are introducing modern plumbing and Maple furniture into
the uttermost parts of France these romantic old inns where it is
charming to breakfast if precarious to sleep are becoming as rare
as the medival keeps with which they are in a way contemporaneous
and Dourdan is fortunate in still having two such perfect specimens to
attract the attention of the archologist

Etampes our next considerable town seemed by contrast rather
featureless and disappointing yet for that very reason so typical
of the average French country towndry compact unsentimental as
if avariciously hoarding a long rich pastthat its one straight
grey street and squat old church will hereafter always serve for the
ville de province background in my staging of French fiction Beyond
Etampes as one approaches Fontainebleau the scenery grows extremely
picturesque with bold outcroppings of blackened rock fields of
golden broom groves of birch and pinefirst hints of the fantastic
sandstone scenery of the forest And presently the long green aisles
opened before us in all the freshness of spring verduretapering away
right and left to distant rondspoints to mossy stone crosses and
obelisksand leading us toward sunset to the old town in the heart of
the forest




IV

THE LOIRE AND THE INDRE


Fontainebleau is charming in May and at no season do its glades more
invitingly detain the wanderer but it belonged to the familiar
the alreadyexperienced part of our itinerary and we had to press
on to the unexplored So after a days roaming of the forest and a
short flight to Moret medivally seated in its stout walls on the
poplaredged Loing we started on our way to the Loire

Here too our wheels were still on beaten tracks though the mornings
flight across country to Orlans was meant to give us a glimpse of a
new region But on that unhappy morning Boreas was up with all his
pack and hunted us savagely across the naked plain now behind now
on our quarter now dashing ahead to lie in ambush behind a huddled
village and leap on us as we rounded its last house The plain
stretched on interminably and the farther it stretched the harder
the wind raced us so that Pithiviers spite of dulcet associations
appeared to our shrinking eyes only as a windbreak eagerly striven
for and too soon gained and passed and when at luncheontime we beat
our way spent and wheezing into Orlans even the serried memories of
that venerable city endeared it to us less than the fact that it had an
inn where we might at last find shelter

The above wholly inadequate description of an interesting part of
France will have convinced any rational being that motoring is no way
to see the country And that morning it certainly was not but then
what of the afternoon When we rolled out of Orlans after luncheon
both the day and the scene had changed and what other form of travel
could have brought us into such communion with the spirit of the Loire
as our smooth flight along its banks in the bland May air For after
all if the motorist sometimes misses details by going too fast he
sometimes has them stamped into his memory by an opportune puncture
or a recalcitrant magneto and if on windy days he has to rush
through nature blindfold on golden afternoons such as this he can
drain every drop of her precious essence

Certainly we got a great deal of the Loire as we followed its windings
that day a great sense of the steely breadth of its flow the amenity
of its shores the sweet flatness of the richly gardened and vineyarded
landscape as of a highly cultivated but slightly insipid society an
impression of long white villages and of stout conical towns on little
hills of old brown Beaugency in its cup between two heights and
Madame de Pompadours Mnars on its bright terraces of Blois nobly
bestriding the river at a noble bend and farther south of yellow
cliffs honeycombed with strange dwellings of Chaumont and Amboise
crowning their heapedup towns of manoirs walled gardens rich
pastures willowed islands and then toward sunset of another long
bridge a brace of fretted churchtowers and the widespread roofs of
Tours

Had we visited by rail the principal places named in this itinerary
necessity would have detained us longer in each and we should have
had a fuller store of specific impressions but we should have missed
what is in one way the truest initiation of travel the sense of
continuity of relation between different districts of familiarity
with the unnamed unhistoried region stretching between successive
centres of human history and exerting in deep unnoticed ways so
persistent an influence on the turn that history takes And after
allthough some people seem to doubt the factit is possible to
stop a motor and get out of it and if on our way down the Loire we
exercised this privilege infrequently it was because here again we
were in a land of old acquaintance of which the general topography was
just the least familiar part

It was not till two days later we passed out of Toursnot in fact
till we left to the northward the towered pile of Lochesthat we
found ourselves once more in a new country It was a cold day of high
clouds and flying sunlight just the sky to overarch the wide rolling
landscape through which the turns of the Indre were leading us To the
south whither we were bound lay the Berrythe land of George Sand
while to the northwest low acclivities sloped away with villages
shining on their sides One arrow of sunlight I remember transfixed
for a second an unknown town on one of these slopes a town of some
consequence with walls and towers that flashed faroff and mysterious
across the cloudy plain Who has not been tantalised in travelling
by the glimpse of such citiesunnamed undiscoverable afterward by
the minutest orientations of map and guidebook Certainly to the
uninitiated no hilltown is visible on that particularly level section
of the map of France yet there sloped the hill there shone the
townnot a moments mirage but the companion of an hours travel
dominating the turns of our road beckoning to us across the increasing
miles and causing me to vow as we lost the last glimpse of its
towers that next year I would go back and make it give up its name

Illustration ORLANS GENERAL VIEW OF THE TOWN

But now we were approaching a town with a namea name so encrusted
and overgrown with associations that it was undeniably disappointing
as we reached its outskirts to find Chteaurouxaside from its fine
old chteau on the Indreso exactly like other dull French towns
so provokingly unconscious of being one of the capital cities of
literature And it seems in fact literally as well as figuratively
unaware of its distinction Fame throws its circles so wide that it
makes not a ripple near home and even the alert landlady of the Htel
Sainte Catherine wrinkled her brows perplexedly at our question Is
one permitted to visit the house of George Sand

Le chteau de George Sand A pause of reflection Cest
lcrivain nestce pas Another pause Cest  Nohant le
chteau Mais Madame je ne saurais vous le dire

Yet here was the northern gate of the Sand countryit was here that
for years the leaders of the most sedentary profession of a sedentary
racethe hommes de lettres of Francedescended from the Paris
express and took a diligence on their pilgrimage to the oracle When
one considers the fatigue of the long days railway journey and the
French dread of dplacements the continual stream of greatness that
Paris poured out upon Nohant gives the measure of what Nohant had to
offer in return

As we sat at breakfast in the inn diningroom we irreverently pictured
some of these great personagesLiszt SainteBeuve Gautier Dumas
fils Flaubertillustrious figures in the queer dishabille of travel
unwinding strange cachenez solicitous for embroidered carpetbags
seated in that very room over their coffee and omelette or climbing
to the coup of the diligence outside And then we set out on the same
road

Straight as an arrow after the unvarying fashion of the French
government highway it runs southeast through vast wheatfields past
barns and farmhouses grouped as in the vanished drawingbooks of
infancynow touching now deserting the Indre banks as the capricious
river throws its poplaredged loops across the plain But presently we
began to mount insensibly till at length a sharp turn and an abrupt
fall of the land brought us out on a ridge above the plain of the
Berry with the river reappearing below and far far south a blue haze
of mountains

The road after that descends again by gentle curves acquainting
one gradually with the charming details of the foregroundpalegreen
copses fields hedged with hawthorn long lines of poplars in the
plainwhile all the way the distant horizon grows richer bluer
and more mysterious It is a wide lonely country with infrequent
villagesmere hamletsdotting the fields one sees how the convivial
Dudevant coming from the livelier Gascony might have found it for
purposes of pothouse sociability a little thinly settled At one of
these small lonely villagesVicqjust where the view spreads widest
the road loses it again by a gradual descent of a mile or so and at
the foot of the hill among hawthorn and lilac hedges through the
boughs of budding trees a high slate roof shows to the leftthe roof
of a plainfaced fawncoloured house the typical gentilhommire of
the French countryside

No other house is in sight only from behind the trees peep two or
three humble tiled cottages dependencies of the larger pile There
is nothing to tell us the name of the housenothing to signalise
it to take it out of the common It stands there large placid
familiarly related to the highroad and the farm like one side of
the extraordinary woman it sheltered and perhaps that fact helps to
suggest its name to render almost superfluous our breathless question
to the pretty goosegirl knitting under the hedge

Mais oui Madamecest Nohant

The goosegirlpink as a hawthorn bud a kerchief tied about her
curlsmight really in the classic phrase of sentimental travel have
stepped out of one of the novels written yonder under the high roof
to which she pointed she had the honest savour of the terroir
yet with that superadded grace that the author of the novels has
been criticised for bestowing on her peasants She formed at any
rate a charming link between our imagination and the famous house
and we presently found that the miracle which had preserved her in
all her  grace had been extended to the whole privileged spot
which seemed under a clear glass bell of oblivion to have been kept
intact unchanged like some wonderful exhibit illustrative of the
extraordinary history lived within it

Illustration NOHANT CHTEAU OF GEORGE SAND

The house faces diagonally toward the road from which a high wall
once screened it but it is written in the Histoire de ma vie that
M Dudevant in a burst of misdirected activity threw down several
yards of this wall and filled the opening with a hedge The hedge
is still there and thanks to this impulse of destruction the
traveller obtains a glimpse of grass terraces and stone steps set in
overgrown thickets of lilac hawthorn and acacia and surmounted by the
long tranquil front of the chteau On each side beyond the stretch
of hedge the wall begins again terminating at one corner of the
property in a massive old cowstable with a round pepperpot tower
at the opposite end is a charming conicalroofed gardenpavilion with
mossy steps ascending to it from the road

At right angles to the highway a shady lane leads down past the farm
buildings and following this one comes around their flank on a
large pleasant untidy farmyard full of cows and chickens and divided
by the long range of the communs from the entrancecourt of the
chteau Farmyard and court both face on a small grassy placewhat
in England would pass for a diminutive commonin the centre of which
under an ancient walnuttree stands a much more ancient churcha
church so tiny black and shrunken that it somehow suggests a blind
old peasant woman mumbling and dozing in the shade This is the parish
church of Nohant and a few yards from it adjoining the court of
the chteau lies the little walled graveyard which figures so often
in the Histoire de ma vie and where she who described it now rests
with her kin The graveyard is defended from intrusion by a high wall
and a locked gate and after all her spirit is not there but in the
house and the gardenabove all in the little cluster of humble old
cottages enclosing the shady place about the church and constituting
apparently the whole village of Nohant Like the goosegirl these
little houses are surprisingly picturesque and sentimental and their
mossy roofs their clipped yews the old whitecapped women who sit
spinning on their doorsteps supply almost too ideal an answer to ones
hopes

Illustration NOHANT GARDEN PAVILION

And when at last excitedly and enchantedly one has taken in the
quiet perfection of it all and turned to confront the great question
Does a sight of Nohant deepen the mystery or elucidate itone can
only answer in the cautious speech of the New England casuist Both
For if it helps one to understand one side of George Sands life it
seems actually to cast a thicker obscurity over otherseven if among
the different sides contemplated one includes only those directly
connected with the place and not the innumerable facets that reflected
Paris Venice Fontainebleau and Majorca

The first surprise is to find the place on the whole so much
moreshall one saydignified and decent so much more conscious
of social order and restraints than the early years of the life led
in it The pictures of Nohant in the Histoire de ma vie are unlike
any other description of French provincial manners at that period
suggesting rather an affinity with the sombre Bront background than
the humdrum but conventional and orderly existence of the French rural
gentry

When one recalls the throng of motley characters who streamed in and
out of that quiet housethe illegitimate children of both sides
living in harmony with one another and with the child of wedlock
the toointimate servants the peasant playmates the drunken boon
companionswhen one turns to the Hogarthian pictures of midnight
carouses presided over by the uproarious Hippolyte and the sombrely
tippling Dudevant while their wives sat disgusted but apparently
tolerant above stairs one feels ones self in the sinister gloom
of Wildfell Hall rather than in the light temperate air of a French
province And somehow unreasonably of course one expects the
house to bear even outwardly some mark of that dark disordered
periodor if not then of the cheerful but equally incoherent and
inconceivable existence led there when the timid Madame Dudevant was
turning into the great George Sand and the strange procession which
continued to stream through the house was composed no longer of drunken
gentlemenfarmers and lefthanded peasant relations but of an almost
equally fantastic and illassorted company of expriests naturalists
journalists SaintSimonians riders of every conceivable religious
political and literary hobby among whom the successive tutors of
the adored Mauriceforming in themselves a line as long as the
kings in Macbethperhaps take the palm for oddness of origin and
adaptability of manners

One expected the scene of these confused and incessant comings and
goings to wear the injured dclass air of a house which has never
had its rights respecteda house long accustomed to jangle its
dinnerbell in vain and swing its broken hinges unheeded and instead
one beholds this image of aristocratic wellbeing this sober edifice
conscious in every line of its place in the social scale of its
obligations to the church and cottages under its wing its rights over
the acres surrounding it And so one may not too fancifully recognise
in it the image of those grave ideals to which George Sand gradually
conformed the passionate experiment of her life may even indulge ones
self by imagining that an old house so marked in its very plainness
its conformity must have exerted over a mind as sensitive as hers
an unperceived but persistent influence giving her that centralising
weight of association and habit which is too often lacking in modern
character and standing ever before her as the shrine of those
household pieties to which inconsistently enough but none the less
genuinely the devotion of her last years was paid




V

NOHANT TO CLERMONT


There happened to us on leaving Nohant what had happened after
Beauvais the quiet country house by the roadside like the mighty
Gothic choir possessed our thoughts to the exclusion of other
impressions As far as La Chtre indeedthe little town on the Indre
where young Madame Dudevant spent a winter to further her husbands
political ambitionswe were still within the Nohant radius and it was
along the straight road we were travelling that poor old Madame Dupin
de Francueilsi douillette that she could hardly make the round of
the gardenfled in her highheeled slippers on the fatal night when
her son returning from a gay supper at La Chtre was flung from his
horse and killed at the entrance to the town These scenes from the
Histoire de ma vie are so vivid they live so poignantly in memory
that in reliving them on the spot one feels with Goncourt how great
their writer would have been had her intrepid pen more often remained
dans le vrai

La Chtre is a charming town with a remarkably picturesque approach
on the Nohant side across an old bridge out of which an old house
with a steep terraced garden seems to grow with the conscious
pleasure of wellgrouped masonry and the streets beyond have an air
of ripe experience tempered by gaiety like that of those ironic old
eighteenthcentury faces wherein the wrinkles are as gay as dimples

Southward from La Chtre the road runs through a beautiful hilly
country to Montluon on the Cher a fine old border town with a
brave fighting past and interesting relics of Bourbon ascendancy
but now deeply disfigured by hideous factories and long grimy streets
of operatives houses In deploring the ravages of modern industry
on one of these rare old towns it is hard to remember that they
are not museum pieces but settlements of human beings with all the
normal desire to prosper at whatever cost to the physiognomy of their
birthplace and Montluon in especial seems to have been a very
pelican to the greed of her offspring

We had meant to spend the night there but there was a grimness about
the innthe special grimness of which the commercial travellers hotel
in the French manufacturing town holds the depressing secretthat
forbade even a glance at the bedrooms and though it was near sunset
we pressed on for Vichy We had in consequence but a cold twilight
glimpse of the fine gorge of Montaigut through which the road cuts
its way to Gannat the first town to the north of the Limagne and
night had set in when we traversed the plain of the Allier On good
French roads however a motorjourney by night is not without its
compensations and our dark flight through mysterious fields and
woods terminated effectively enough with the long descent down a
lampgarlanded boulevard into the inanimate white wateringplace

Illustration CLERMONTFERRAND NOTREDAME DU PORT

Vichy in fact had barely opened the shutters of its fashionable
hotels the season does not begin till June and in May only a few
premature bathersmostly Englishshiver in corners of the marble
halls or disconsolately peruse last years news in the deserted
readingrooms But even in this semichrysalis stage the town presented
itself the next morning as that rarest of spectaclesgrace
triumphant over the processes of the toilet Only a pretty woman and a
French ville deau can look really charming in morning dishabille
and the way in which Vichy accomplishes the feat would be a lesson to
many pretty women

The place at all seasons is an objectlesson to less enlightened
municipalities and when one finds ones self vainly wishing that art
and history and all the rich tapestry of the past might somehow be
brought before the eyes of our selfsufficient millions one might
pause to ask if the sight of a wellkept selfrespecting French town
carefully and artistically planned as a setting to the amenities of
life would not after all offer the more salutary and surprising
example

Vichy even among French towns stands out as a singularly finished
specimen of what such municipal pride can accomplish From its broad
planeshaded promenade flanked by brightfaced hotels and by
the arcades of the Casino to the park on the Allier and the wide
circumjacent boulevards it wears at every turn the same trim holiday
air the rouge and patches of smooth gravel bright flowerborders
gay shops shady benches inviting cafs Even the cabstands with
their smart visvis and victorias drawn by plump cobs in tinkling
harnesses seem part of a dreamtown where all that is usually sordid
and shabby has been touched by the magic wand of trimness or where
some utopian millionaire has successfully demonstrated that the sordid
and shabby need never exist at all

But to the American observer Vichy is perhaps most instructive just
because it is not the millionaires wand which has worked the spell
because the town owes its gaiety and its elegance not to the private
villa the rich mans showplace but to wise public expenditure of
the money which the bathers annually pour into its exchequer

It was however rather for the sake of its surroundings than for
the study of its unfolding season that we had come there and the
neighbouring country offered the richest return for our enterprise

From the plain of the Limagne the hills slope up behind Vichy in a
succession of terraces divided by streams and deeplywooded glens and
connected by the interlacing of admirable roads that civilises the
remotest rural districts of France Climbing these gradual heights to
the hillvillage of Ferrires we had the day after our arrival our
first initiation into what the near future held for usa glorious
vision across the plain of the Monts Dore and the Monts de Dme
The blue mountain haze that had drawn us steadily southward from our
first glimpse of it on the heights of the Berry now resolved itself
into a range of wild volcanic forms some curved like the bellshaped
apses of the churches of Auvergne some slenderly cuplike and
showing the hollow rim of the spent crater all fantastic individual
indescribably differentiated in line and colour from mountain forms
of less violent origin And between them and us lay the richest
contrasting landscape the deep meadows and luxuriant woodlands of the
Allier vale with here and there a volcanic knoll lifting on its crest
an old town or a Rhenishlooking castle The landscape thus viewed
presents a perplexing mixture of suggestions recalling now the brown
hillvillages of Umbria now the robber castles of the Swiss Rhineland
with a hint again of the Terra di Lavore in its bare mountain lines
and the prodigal fertility of their lower slopes so that one felt
ones self moving in a confusion of scenes romantically combined as in
the foreground of a Claude or a Wilson for the greater pleasure of the
eclectic eye

The only landscape that seems to have been excluded from the
composition is that of France all through Auvergne we never
felt ourselves in France But that is of course merely because
the travellers France is apt to be mainly made up of bits of the
IledeFrance and Normandy and Brittany and not till one has
explored the central and southwestern provinces does one learn of the
countless Frances within France and realise that one may find ones
Switzerland ones Italy without crossing the Alps to reach them

We had the next day a closer impression of the scene we had looked
down on from Ferrires motoring first along the high ridge above
the Limagne to the ancient black hilltown of Thiers and thence
descending again to the plain Our way led across it by the charming
castled town of PontdeChteau to ClermontFerrand which spreads its
swarthy mass at the base of the Puy de Dmethat strangest sternest
of cities all built and paved in the black volcanic stone of Volvic
and crowned by the sinister splendour of its black cathedral It was
ViolletleDuc who added the west front and towers to this high ancient
pile and for once his rash hand was so happily inspired that at the
first glimpse of his twin spires soaring above the roofs of Clermont
one forgives himfor the momentthe wrong he did to Blois to
Pierrefonds and Vzelay




VI

IN AUVERGNE


At last we were really in Auvergne On our balcony at Royat just
under the flank of the Puy de Dme we found ourselves in close
communion with its tossed heights its black towns its threatening
castles And Royat itselfeven the dull new wateringplace quarteris
extremely characteristic of the region hanging in a cleft of the great
volcanic upheaval with hotels villas gardens vineyards clutching
precariously at every ledge and fissure as though just arrested in
their descent on the roofs of Clermont

As a wateringplace Royat is not an ornamental specimen of its class
and it has the farther disadvantage of being connected with Clermont
by a long dusty suburb noisy with tramcars but as a centre for
excursions it offers its good hotels and modern conveniences at the
precise spot most favourable to the motorist who may radiate from it
upon almost every centre of interest in Auvergne and return at night
to digestible food and clean bedstwo requisites for which in central
France one is often doomed to pine

Auvergne one of the most interesting and hitherto almost the least
known of the old French provinces offers two distinct and equally
striking sides to the appreciative traveller on the one hand its
remarkably individual church architecture and on the other the
no less personal character of its landscape Almost all its towns
are distinguished by one of those ancient swarthy churches with
western narthex great central tower and curious incrustations of
polychrome lava which marked in Auvergne as strongly distinctive
an architectural impulse as flowered on a vastly larger scale and
a century or more later in the Gothic of the Ile de France And the
towns surrounding these churches on the crest or flank of one of the
volcanic eminences springing from the plainthe towns themselves with
their narrow perpendicular streets and tall black houses are so darkly
individual so plainly akin to the fierce predatory castles on the
neighbouring hills that one is arrested at every turn by the desire
to follow up the obscure threads of history connecting them with this
littleknown portion of the rich French past

But to the traveller restricted by time the other side of the
pictureits background rather of tormented blue peaks and
widespread forestwhich must assert itself at all seasons quite as
distinctively as the historic and architectural character of the towns
is likely in May to carry off the victory We had come at any rate
with the modest purpose of taking a mere birdseye view of the region
such a flight across the scene as draws one back later to brood and
hover and our sight of the landscape from the Royat balcony confirmed
us in the resolve to throw as sweeping a glance as possible and defer
the study of details to our nextour alreadyprojectedvisit

The following morning therefore we set out early for the heart of the
Monts Dore Our road carried us southward along a series of ridges
above the wide Allier vale and then up and down over wild volcanic
hills now densely wooded now desolately bare We were on the road
to Issoire and La Chaise Dieu two of the most notable old towns of
southern Auvergne but in pursuit of scenery we reluctantly turned
off at the village of Coudes at the mouth of a lateral valley and
struck up toward the western passes which lead to the Pic de Sancy

Some miles up this valley which follows the capricious windings of
the Couzes lie the baths of Saint NectaireleBas romantically
planted in a narrow defile beneath the pyramidal Romanesque church
which the higherlying original village lifts up on a steep splinter
of rock The landscape beyond Saint Nectaire grows more rugged and
Alpine in character the pastures have a Swiss look and the shaggy
mountainsides are clothed with a northern growth of beech and pine
Presently at a turn of the road we came on the little craterlake
of Chambon its vivid blueness set in the greenest of meadows and
overhung by the dark basalt cliff which carries on its summit the
fortified castle of Murols The situation of Murols lifted on its
shaft of rock above that lonely upland valley is in itself impressive
enough to bring out the full value of such romantic suggestions as it
has to offer and the monument is worthy of its site It is in fact a
very noble ruin raising its central keep above two outer circuits of
battered masonry the ampler and later of which shows the classical
pilasters and large fenestration of what must have been one of the
stateliest specimens of the last stage of French feudal architecture
Though the guidebooks record a mention of Murols as early as the
thirteenth century the castle now standing is all of later date
and the great rectangular exterior is an interesting example of the
transitional period when Italian palace architecture began to be
grafted on the rugged stock of French military construction

Just beyond the lake of Chambon the road begins to mount the long
curves of the Col de Diane the pass which leads over into the valley
of Mont Dore As we rose through bleak meadows and patches of scant
woodland the mountains of Auvergne unrolled themselves to the east
in one of those lonely tossing expanses of summit and ridge and chasm
that suggest the mysterious undulations of some uninhabited planet
Though the Col de Diane is not a high pass it gives from its yoke
a strangely memorable impression of distance and mystery partly
perhaps because in that desert region there is neither village nor
house to break the labyrinth of peaks but chiefly because of the
convulsed outlines into which they have been tossed by subterranean
fires

A cold wind swept the top of the pass and snow still lay under the
rocks by the roadside so that it was cheering to the spirits as well
as to the eye when we presently began our descent through dark pine
forests into the vale of the Dordogne The baths of Mont Dore lie
directly beneath the pass at the mouth of a valley hollowed out of
the side of the Pic de Sancy the highest peak in Auvergne In spite
of milder air and bright spring foliage we were still distinctly in
high places and Mont Dore itself not yet decked for the entertainment
of its bathers had the povertystricken look which everywhere marks
the real mountain village Later no doubt when its hotels are
open and its scanty gardens in bloom it takes on a thin veneer of
frivolity but it must always be an austerelooking village with its
illkept cobblestone streets and gaunt stone houses grouped against
a background of Alpine pastures We were not sorry therefore that
its few restaurants presented barred shutters to our midday hunger
and that we were obliged to follow the first footsteps of the infant
Dordogne down the valley to the lowerlying baths of Bourboule

The Dordogne is a child of lusty growth and at its very leap from the
cradle under the Pic de Sancy it rolls a fine brown torrent beneath
steeply wooded banks Its course led us rapidly down the mountain
glen to the amiable but somewhat characterless little wateringplace
of La Bourboule set in a depression of the hills with a background
of slopes which in summer might offer fairly pleasant walks between
ones douches and here at a fresh white hotel with an affable
landlady we lunched on trout that must have leapt straight from the
Dordogne into the fryingpan

Illustration ORCIVAL THE CHURCH

After luncheon we once more took our way along the lively curves of the
river to part with them at last reluctantly a few miles down the
valley and strike out across a dull plateau to the mountain town of
Laqueillea gaunt windbeaten place with nothing of note to offer
except its splendid view from the dizzy verge of a high cornice which
overhangs the valley running south from the chain of the Dme Beyond
Laqueille again we began to descend by long windings and at last
turning off from the direct road to Royat we engaged ourselves in a
series of wooded gorges in search of the remote village of Orcival

The church of Orcival is one of the most noted of that strange group
of Auvergnat churches which some students of French Romanesque are
disposed to attribute not only to one brief period of time but to
the hand of one architect so closely are they allied not alone in
plan and construction but in their peculiar and original decorative
details We had resolved therefore not to return to Royat without a
sight of Orcival and spite of the misleading directions plentifully
bestowed on us by the way and resulting in endless doublings through
narrow lonely glens we finally came in the neck of the last and
narrowest upon a huddled group of stone roofs with a church rising
nobly above them

Here it was at lastand our first glance told us how well worth the
search we had made for it But a second made evident the disturbing
fact that a cattlefair was going on in the village and though this is
not an unusual event in French towns or one calculated in general to
interfere with the movements of the sightseer we soon saw that owing
to the peculiar position of Orcival which is jammed into the head of
its glen as tightly as a cork in a bottle the occupation of the square
about the church formed a complete check to circulation

And the square was fully occupied it presented as we descended on it
an agitated surface of blue human backs and dun and white bovine ones
so closely and inextricably mixed that any impact from without merely
sent a wave across the mass without making the slightest break in its
substance On its edge therefore we halted the church with its
beautiful rounded chevet and central pyramidtower islanded a few
yards away across a horned sea which divided it from us as hopelessly
as Egypt from Israel and the waves of the sea setting toward us with
somewhat threatening intent at the least sign of our attempting to
cross it There was therefore nothing to be done but to own ourselves
intruders and defer a sight of Orcival till our next visit and with
much backing and wriggling and some unfavourable comment on the part
of the opposition we effected a crestfallen exit from that interesting
but inhospitable village

The road thence to Royat climbs over the long Col de Ceyssat close
under the southern side of the Puy de Dme and we looked up longingly
at the bare top of the mountain yearning to try the ascent but
fearing that our horsepower was not pitched to such heights That
adventure too was therefore deferred till our next visit which every
renunciation of the kind was helping to bring nearer and make more
inevitable and we pushed on to Royat across the plain of Laschamp
noted in the records of motoring as the startingpoint of the perilous
circuit dAuvergne




VII

ROYAT TO BOURGES


The term of our holiday was upon us and stern necessity took us back
the next day to Vichy We followed this time the road along the
western side of the Limagne passing through the old towns of Riom
and Aigueperse Riom thanks to its broad boulevards and bright open
squares struck us as the most cheerful and animated place we had seen
in Auvergne and it has besides a great air of Renaissance elegance
many of its old traceried htels having been built in the sixteenth
century which saw the chief development of the town

Aigueperse on the contrary spite of its situation in the same sunny
luxuriant plain presents the morose aspect of the typical town of
Auvergne without many compensating merits save that of two striking
pictures of the Italian school which are to be seen in its modernised
cathedral From Aigueperse our road struck eastward across the Limagne
to Gannat and thence through pleasant fields and woods we returned
to Vichy on the opposite edge of the plain

We started early the next morning on our journey to the north for
our slight experience of the inns of central France made us anxious
to reach Orlans by night Such long runs cannot be made without the
sacrifice of much that charms and arrests one by the way and this part
of the country should be seen at leisure in the long summer days when
the hotels are less sepulchrally damp and when one can remain late out
of doors instead of having to shiver through the evening hours around
a smoky oillamp in a room which will not bear inspection even by that
inadequate light

We suffered I remember many pangs by the way and not least that of
having to take as a mere parenthesis the charmingly complete little
town of La Palisse on the Bbre with the ruined ivied castle of the
Comtes de Chabannes overhanging a curve of the river and grouping
itself in a memorable composition with the picturesque houses below it

Farther north again Moulins on the Allier inflicted a still deeper
pang for this fine old town has considerable claims to distinction
besides the great triptych that made its name known through Europe
after the recent exhibition of French Primitives in Paris The Virgin
of Moulins gloriously enthroned in the cathedral among her softfaced
Lombard angels remains undoubtedly the crowning ornament of the town
if only on account of the problem which she holds out so inscrutably
to explorers of the baffling annals of early French art But aside
from this preminent possession and the interest of several minor
relics Moulins has the attraction of its own amiable and distinguished
physiognomy With its streets of lightcoloured stone its handsome
eighteenthcentury htels and broad wellpaved cours it seemed
after the grim black towns of the south a singularly open and cheerful
place and one was conscious behind the handsome stone gateways and
balconied faades of the existence of old panelled drawingrooms with
pastel portraits and faded tapestry furniture

The approach to Nevers the old capital of the Nivernais carried
us abruptly back to the Middle Ages but to an exuberant northern
medivalism far removed from the GalloRoman tradition of central
France The cathedral of Nevers with its ornate portals and
fantastically decorated clocktower has in the old ducal palace
across the square a rival more than capable of meeting its challenge
on equal grounds a building of really gallant exterior with fine
angle towers and within a great staircase commemorating in luxuriant
sculpture the legendary beginnings of that ancient house of Cleves
which in the fifteenth century allied itself by marriage with the
dukes of Burgundy

At Nevers we found ourselves once more on the Loire but only to
break from it again in a long dash across country to Bourges At this
point we left behind us the charming diversified scenery which had
accompanied us to the borders of the Loire and entered on a region
of low monotonous undulations flattening out gradually into the vast
wheatfields about Bourges But who would wish any other setting
for that memorable silhouette throned from whichever point of the
compass one approaches it in such proud isolation above the plain One
forgets even in a distant view of Bourges that nature has helped by
an opportune rise of the ground to lift the cathedral to its singular
eminence the hill and the town upon it seem so merely the unremarked
pedestal of the monument It is not till one climbs the steep street
leading up from the Place Saint Bonnet that one realises the peculiar
topographical advantages of such a site advantages which perhaps
partly account for the overwhelming and not quite explicable effect of
a first sight of the cathedral

Illustration MOULINS PLACE DE LHTELDEVILLE AND THE JACQUEMART
TOWER

Even now on a second visit with the great monuments of the Ile
de France fresh in memory we felt the same effect and the same
difficulty in running it down in differentiating it from the
richer yet perhaps less deeply Gothic impression produced by the
rival churches of the north For begin as one will by admitting by
insisting upon the defects of Bourgesits irregular inharmonious
faade its thin piers its mean outer aislesone yet ends in a state
where criticism perforce yields to sensation where one surrenders
ones self wholly to the spell of its spiritual suggestion Certainly
it would be hard to put a finger either within or without on the
specific tangible cause of this feeling Is it to be found in the
extraordinary beauty of the five western portals so crowded with noble
and pathetic imagery and delicate ornamental detail But the doors
of Chartres surpass even these Is it then if one looks within the
rich blue and red of its dense ancient glass But Chartres again has
finer glass of that unmatched period Is it the long clear sweep of
the nave and aisles uninterrupted by the crosslines of transept or
chancelscreen But if one recalls the wonderful convolutions of the
ambulatory of Canterbury one has to confess that Gothic arteven in
its conventionalised English formhas created curves of greater poetry
and mystery produced a more thrilling sense of shadowy consecrated
distances Perhaps the spell of Bourges resides in a fortunate
accidental mingling of many of the qualities that predominate in this
or that more perfect structurein the mixing of the ingredients so
that there rises from them as one stands in one of the lofty inner
aisles with ones face toward the choir that breath of mystical
devotion which issues from the very heart of medival Christianity

With this sweetness wrote Saint Theresa of the Prayer of Quiet
the whole inner and outer man seems to be delighted as though
some delicious ointment were poured into the soul like an exquisite
perfume  as if we suddenly came to a place where it is exhaled
not only from one but from many things and we know not what it is
or from which one of them it comes but they all penetrate us If
Amiens in its harmony of conception and vigour of execution seems
to embody the developing willpower of a people passionate in belief
and indomitable in the concrete expression of their creed here at
Bourges one feels that other less expressible side of the great ruling
influence of the Middle Agesthe power that willed mighty monuments
and built them yet also even in its moments of most brutal material
ascendancy created the other houses not built with hands where the
spirits of the saints might dwell




PART II




I

PARIS TO POITIERS


Spring again and the long white road unrolling itself southward from
Paris How could one resist the call

We answered it on the blandest of late March mornings all April in the
air and the Seine fringing itself with a mist of yellowish willows
as we rose over it climbing the hill to Ville dAvray Spring comes
soberly inaudibly as it were in these temperate European lands where
the grass holds its green all winter and the foliage of ivy laurel
holly and countless other evergreen shrubs links the lifeless to the
living months But the mere act of climbing that southern road above
the Seine meadows seemed as definite as the turning of a leafthe
passing from a blackandwhite page to one illuminated And every day
now would turn a brighter page for us

Goethe has a charming verse descriptive it is supposed of his first
meeting with Christiane Vulpius Aimlessly I strayed through the wood
having it in my mind to seek nothing

Such precisely was our state of mind on that first days run We were
simply pushing south toward the Berry through a more or less familiar
country and the real journey was to begin for us on the morrow with
the run from Chteauroux to Poitiers But we reckoned without our
France It is easy enough glancing down the long page of the Guide
Continental to slip by such names as Versailles Rambouillet Chartres
and Valenay in ones dash for the objective point but there is no
slipping by them in the motor they lurk there in ones path throwing
out great loops of persuasion arresting ones flight complicating
ones impressions oppressing bewildering one with the renewed
halfforgotten sense of the hoarded richness of France

Illustration BOURGES APSE OF THE CATHEDRAL

Versailles first unfolding the pillared expanse of its north faade
to vast empty perspectives of radiating avenues then Rambouillet
low in a damp little park with statues along green canals and a
look this moist March weather of being somewhat below sealevel
then Maintenon its rich redpurple walls and delicate stone ornament
reflected in the moat dividing it from the village street Both
Rambouillet and Maintenon are characteristically French in their way of
keeping company with their villages Rambouillet indeed is slightly
screened by a tall gate a wall and trees but Maintenons warm red
turrets look across the moat straight into the windows of the opposite
houses with the simple familiarity of a time when class distinctions
were too fixed to need emphasising

Our third chteau Valenaywhich for comparisons sake one may
couple with the others though it lies far south of BloisValenay
bears itself with greater aloofness bidding the town keep its
distance down the hill on which the great house lifts its heavy
angletowers and flattened domes A huge clifflike wall enclosing the
whole southern flank of the hill supports the terraced gardens before
the chteau which to the north is divided from the road by a vast
cour dhonneur with a monumental grille and gateway The impression
is grander yet less noble

Illustration CHTEAU OF MAINTENON

But France is never long content to repeat her effects and between
Maintenon and Valenay she puts Chartres and Blois Ah these grey old
cathedral towns with their narrow clean streets widening to a central
placeat Chartres a beautiful oval like the marketplace in an
eighteenthcentury printwith their clipped limewalks high garden
walls Balzacian gables looking out on sunless lanes under the flanks
of the granite giant Save in the church itself how frugally all the
effects are producedwith how sober a use of greys and blacks and
pale high lights as in some Van der Meer interior yet how intense a
suggestion of thrifty compact traditional life one gets from the low
housefronts the barred gates the glimpses of clean bare courts
the calm yet quick faces in the doorways From these faces again
one gets the same impression of remarkable effects produced by the
discreetest means The French physiognomy if not vividly beautiful is
vividly intelligent but the long practice of manners has so veiled
its keenness with refinement as to produce a blending of vivacity
and good temper nowhere else to be matched And in looking at it one
feels once more as one so often feels in trying to estimate French
architecture or the French landscape how much of her total effect
France achieves by elimination If marked beauty be absent from the
French face how much more is marked dulness marked brutality the
lumpishness of the clumsily made and the unfinished As a mere piece of
workmanship of finish the French provincial facethe peasants face
evenoften has the same kind of interest as a work of art

One gets after repeated visits to the show towns of France to feel
these minor characteristics the incidental graces of the foreground
almost to the exclusion of the great official spectacle in the
centre of the picture so that while the first image of Bourges or
Chartres is that of a cathedral surrounded by a blur later memories
of the same places present a vividly individual town with doorways
streetcorners faces intensely remembered and in the centre a great
cloudy Gothic splendour

At Chartres the cloudy splendour is shot through with such effulgence
of colour that its vision evoked by memory seems to beat with a
fiery life of its own as though red blood ran in its stone veins
It is this suffusion of heat and radiance that chiefly to the
untechnical distinguishes it from the other great Gothic interiors In
all the rest colour if it exists at all burns in scattered unquiet
patches between wastes of shadowy grey stone and the wan pallor of
later painted glass but at Chartres those quivering waves of unearthly
red and blue flow into and repeat each other in rivers of light from
their source in the great western rose down the length of the vast
aisles and clerestory till they are gathered up at last into the
mystical heart of the apse

A short afternoons run carried us through dullish country from
Chartres to Blois which we reached at the fortunate hour when sunset
burnishes the great curves of the Loire and lays a plumcoloured bloom
on the slate roofs overlapping scalelike the slope below the castle
There are few finer roofviews than this from the wall at Blois the
blue sweep of gables and ridgelines billowing up here and there into a
church tower with its clocheton mailed in slate or breaking to let
through the glimpse of a carved faade or the blossoming depths of a
hanging garden but perhaps only the eye subdued to tin housetops and
iron chimneypots can feel the full poetry of old roofs

Coming back to the Berry six weeks earlier than on our last years
visit we saw how much its wide landscape needs the relief and
modelling given by the varied foliage of May Between bare woods and
scarcely budded hedges the great meadows looked bleak and monotonous
and only the village gardens hung out a visible promise of spring But
in the sheltered enclosure at Nohant spring seemed much nearer at
hand already in clumps of snowdrops and violets loosening the soil
in young red leaves on the rosestandards and the twitter of birds
in the heavy blackfruited ivy of the graveyard wall A gate leads
from the garden into the corner of the graveyard where George Sand and
her children lie under an ancient yew Feudal even in burial they
are walled off from the village dead and the tombstone of Maurice
Sand as well as the monstrous stone chest over his mothers grave
bears the name of Dudevant and asserts a claim to the barony Strange
inconsequence of human desires that the woman who had made her
pseudonym illustrious enough to have it assumed by her whole family
should cling in death to the obscure name of a repudiated husband more
inconsequent still that the descendant of kings and the priestess of
democracy and Fourierism should insist on a right to the petty title
which was never hers since it was never Dudevants to give On the
whole the gravestones at Nohant are disillusioning except indeed
that of the wretched Solange with its four tragic words La mre de
Jeanne

But the real meaning of the place must be sought close by behind the
row of tall windows opening on the tangled mossy garden They lead
these windows straight into the life of George Sand into the big
cool diningroom with its flagged floor and simple whitepanelled
walls and the salon adjoining the salon alas so radically
remodelled in the unhappy midcentury period of wallpapers stuffed
furniture and centre table that one seeks in vain for a trace of
the original chatelaine of Nohantthat highspirited highheeled
old Madame Dupin who still haunts the panelled diningroom and the
boxedged garden Yet the salon has its special story to tell for
in George Sands culminating time just such a long table with fringed
cover and encircling armchairs formed the centre of French indoor
life About this elongated board sat the great womans illustrious
visitors prolonging as at a mental table dhte that interminable
dinnertalk which still strikes the hurried AngloSaxon as the
typical expression of French sociability and here the different
arts of the household were practisedthe painting carving and fine
needlework which a strongereyed generation managed to carry on by
the light of a single lamp Here one likes especially to fancy
Maurice Sand exercised his chisel on the famous marionettes for the
little theatre while his mother fitting their costumes with skilful
fingers listened silent comme une bte to the dissertations
of Gautier Flaubert or Dumas The earlier life of the house still
speaks moreover from the walls of the drawingroom with the voice of
jealously treasured ancestral portraitspictures of the demoiselles
Verrires of the great Marshal and the beautiful Aurorastrange
memorials of a past which explains so much in the history of George
Sand even to the tempestuous face of Solange Clsinger looking darkly
across the room at her simpering unremorseful progenitors

Our guide a closecapped brownandruddy bonne led us next by
circuitous passages to the most interesting corner of the house the
little theatre contrived with artless ingenuity out of what might have
been a storeroom or winecellar One should rather say the little
theatres however for the mistress of revels had managed to crowd two
stages into the limited space at her disposal one to the left an
actual scne with lifesize scenery for real actors the other
facing the entrancedoor the more celebrated marionette theatre
raised a few feet from the floor with miniature proscenium arch and
curtain just such a Puppentheatre as Wilhelm Meister described to
Marianne with a prolixity which caused that amiable but flighty young
woman to fall asleep

Between the two stages about twenty spectators might have found
seats behind the front row of hard wooden benches reserved for the
chtelaine and her most distinguished guests A clean emptiness
now pervades this temple of the arts an emptiness made actually
pathetic by the presence on shelves at the back of the room of the
whole troupe of marionettes brushed spotless well cared for and
waiting only a touch on their wires to spring into life and populate
their little stage There they stand in wistful rows the duenna the
Chimne the grande coquette Pantaloon Columbine and Harlequin
Neapolitan fishers odalisques and peasants brigands and soldiers
of the guard all carved with a certain rude vivacity and dressed
ingeniously and thriftily by the indefatigable fingers which drove the
quill all night upstairs

It brought one close to that strange unfathomable life which only at
Nohant grows clear shows bottom as it were closer still to be told
by the redbrown bonne that Monsieur Maurice had modelled many of
his humorous peasanttypes on les gens du pays closest of all when
she added in answer to a question as to whether Madame Sand had really
made the little frocks herself Oh yes I remember seeing her at
work on them and helping her with it I was twelve years old when she
died

Illustration NEUVY SAINTSPULCRE CHURCH OF THE PRECIOUS BLOOD

Here then was an actual bit of the Nohant tradition before us in
robust and lively middle age one of the berrichonnes whom George
Sand loved and celebrated and who loved and served her in return For
a moment it brought Nohant within touch yet the final effect of the
contact as one reflected on the vanished enthusiasms and ideals that
George Sands name revives was the sense that the world of beliefs
and ideas has seldom travelled so fast and far as in the years between
Indiana and today

                                   

From La Chtre just south of Nohant we turned due west along the
valley of the Creuse through a country possessing some local fame
for picturesqueness but which struck us in its early spring nudity
as somewhat parched and chalkylooking without sufficient woodland
to drape its angles It makes up however in architectural interest
for what its landscape lacks and not many miles beyond La Chtre the
otherwise featureless little town of NeuvySaintSpulcre presents one
feature of unusual prominence This is the ancient round church from
which the place is named one of those copies of the church of the
Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem with which the returning crusader dotted
western Europe Aside from their intrinsic interest these sepulchre
churches have gained importance from the fact that but three or four
are still extant The most typical that of Saint Bnigne at Dijon has
been levelled to a mere crypt and that of Cambrige deviates from the
type by reason of its octagonal dome so that the church of Neuvy is of
quite preminent interest A late Romanesque naveitself sufficiently
venerable looking to stir the imagination in its own behalfwas
appended in the early thirteenth century to the circular shrine
but the latter still presents to the dull old street its unbroken
cylindrical wall built close on a thousand years ago and surmounted
some ninety years later by a second story with a Romanesque exterior
arcade At this stage however one is left to conjecture with the
aid of expert suggestion what manner of covering the building was
meant to have The present small dome perched on the inner drum of
the upper gallery is an expedient of the most obvious sort and the
archologists have inferred that the thinness of this drum may have
made a more adequate form of roofing impossible

To the idle sightseer at any rate the interior of the church is
much more suggestive than its bare outer shell We were happy enough
to enter it toward sunset when dusk had gathered under the heavy
encircling columns and lights twinkled yellow on the central altar
which has so regrettably replaced the Grotto of the Sepulchre It was
our added good fortune that a small train of the faithful headed by a
redcassocked verger and a priest with a benignant Massillonlike head
were just making a circuit of the stations of the cross affixed to the
walls of the aisle and as we stood withdrawn while the procession
wound its way between shining altar and shadowy columns some of the
faces of the peasants seemed to carry us as far into the past as the
strange symbolic masks on the capitals above their heads

But what carries one farthest of all is perhaps the fact well known
to modern archology that the original church built by Constantine
over the grottotomb of Christ was not a round temple at all but a
vast basilica with semicircular apse The Persians destroyed this
building in the seventh century and the Christians who undertook to
restore it could do no more than round the circle of the apse thus
at least covering over the sacred tomb in the centre So swift was
the succession of demolition and reconstruction in that confused and
clashing age so vague and soon obliterated were the records of each
previous rule that when the crusaders came they found no memory of
this earlier transformation and carried back with them that model of
the round temple which was henceforth to stand throughout western
Europe as the venerated image of the primitive church of Jerusalem

Too much lingering in this precious little building brought twilight
on us soon after we joined the Creuse at Argenton and when we left
it again at Le Blanc lights were in the windows and the rest of our
run to Poitiers was a ghostly flight through a moonwashed landscape
with here and there a church tower looming in the dimness or a heap
of ruined walls rising mysteriously above the white bend of a river
We suffered a peculiar pang when a longroofed pile towering overhead
told us that we were passing the great Benedictine abbey of Saint
Savin with its matchless lining of frescoes but a certain mental
satiety urged us on to Poitiers

Travellers accustomed to the marked silhouette of Italian citiesto
their immediate proffer of the picturesque impressionoften find
the old French provincial towns lacking in physiognomy Each Italian
city whether of the mountain or the plain has an outline easily
recognisable after individual details have faded and it is obviously
much easier to keep separate ones memories of Siena and Orvieto than
of Bourges and Chartres Perhaps therefore the few French towns with
definite physiognomies seem the more definite from their infrequency
and Poitiers is foremost in this distinguished group

Illustration NEUVY SAINTSPULCRE INTERIOR OF THE CHURCH

Not that it offers the distinctive galbe of such bold hilltowns as
Angoulme or Laon Though a hilltown in fact it somehow makes next
to nothing of this advantage and the late Mr Freeman was justified
in grumbling at the lack of character in its skyline That character
reveals itself in fact not in any picturesqueness of distant
effectin no such farseen crown as the towers of Laon or the domes
of Prigueuxbut in the homogeneous interest of the old buildings
within the city the way they carry on its packed romantic history
like the consecutive pages of a richly illuminated chronicle The
illustration of that history begins with the strange little temple
of Saint John a baptistery of the fourth century and accounted the
earliest Christian building in Francethough this applies only to the
lower story now virtually the crypt the upper having been added
some three hundred years later when baptism by aspersion had replaced
the primitive plunge Unhappily the ancient temple has suffered the
lot of the toohighly treasured relic and fenced about restored and
converted into a dry little museum has lost all that colour and pathos
of extreme age that make the charm of humbler monuments

This charm in addition to many others still clings to the expressive
west front of Notre Dame la Grande the incomparable little Romanesque
church holding the centre of the marketplace Built of a dark grey
stone which has taken onand been suffered to retaina bloom of
golden lichen like the trace of ancient weatherworn gilding it
breaks at the spring of its portalarches into a profusion of
serried overlapping sculpture which rises tier by tier to the
splendid Christ Triumphant of the crowning gable yet never once crowds
out and smothers the structural composition as Gothic ornament in
its most exuberant phase was wont to do Through all its profusion of
statuary and ornamental carving the front of Notre Dame preserves that
subordination to classical composition that marks the Romanesque of
southern France but between the arches in the great spandrils of the
doorways up to the typically Poitevin scales of the beautiful arcaded
angle turrets what richness of detail what splendid play of fancy

Illustration POITIERS BAPTISTERY OF ST JOHN

After such completeness of beauty as this little church presentsfor
its nave and transept tower are no less admirable than the more
striking fronteven such other monuments as Poitiers has to offer must
suffer slightly by comparison Saint Hilaire le Grand that notable
eleventhcentury church with its triple aisles and its nave roofed
by cupolas and the lowerlying temple of Sainte Radegonde which
dates from the Merovingian queen from whom it takes its name have
both suffered such repeated alterations that neither carries the
imagination back with as direct a flight as the slightly less ancient
Notre Dame and the cathedral itself which one somehow comes to last
in an enumeration of the Poitiers churches is a singularly charmless
building Built in the twelfth century by Queen Eleanor of Guyenne
at the interesting moment of transition from the round to the pointed
arch and completed later by a widesprawling Gothic front it gropes
after and fails of its effect both without and within Yet it has one
memorable possession in its thirteenthcentury choirstalls almost
alone of that date in Francetall severe seats their backs formed by
pointed arches with delicate lowrelief carvings between the spandrils
There is in especial one small bat with outspread weblike wings so
exquisitely fitted into its allotted space and with such delicacy of
observation shown in the modelling of its little halfhuman face that
it remains in memory as having the permanence of something classical
outside of dates and styles

Having lingered over these things and taken in by the way an
impression of the confused and rambling ducal palace with its
magnificent grande salle completed and adorned by Jean de Berry we
began to think remorsefully of the wonders we had missed on our run
from Le Blanc to Poitiers We could not retrace the whole distance but
at least we could return to the curious little town of Chauvigny of
which we had caught a tantalising glimpse above a moonlit curve of the
Vienne

Illustration POITIERS THE CHURCH OF NOTREDAMELAGRANDE

We found it by day no less suggestive and full of unsuspected
riches Of its two large Romanesque churches the one in the lower
town beside the river is notable without for an extremely beautiful
arcaded apse and contains within a striking fresco of the fifteenth
century in which Christ is represented followed by a throng of the
faithfulkings bishops monks and clerkswho help to carry the
cross The other and larger church planted on the summit of the
abrupt escarpment which lifts the haute ville above the Vienne has
a strange bodyguard composed of no fewer than five feudal castles
huddled so close together on the narrow top of the cliff that their
outer walls almost touch The lack in that open country of easily
fortified points doubtless drove the bishops of Poitiers who were
also barons of Chauvigny into this strange defensive alliance with
four of their noble neighbours and one wonders how the fivesided
mnage kept the peace when local disturbances made it needful to take
to the rock

The gashed walls and ivydraped dungeons of the rival ruins make an
extraordinarily romantic setting for the curious church of Saint
Pierre staunchly seated on an extreme ledge of the cliff and
gathering under its flank the handful of town within the fortified
circuit There is nothing in architecture so suggestive of extreme
age yet of a kind of hale durability as these thickset Romanesque
churches with their prudent vaulting their solid central towers the
close firm grouping of their apsidal chapels The Renaissance brought
the classic style into such permanent relationship to modern life that
eleventhcentury architecture seems remoter than Greece and Rome yet
its buildings have none of the perilous frailly of the later Gothic
and one associates the idea of romance and ruin rather with the pointed
arch than with the round

Saint Pierre is a singularly good example of this stout old school
which saw the last waves of barbarian invasion break at its feet and
seems likely to see the ebb and flow of so many other tides before
its stubborn walls go under It is in their sculptures especially
that these churches reach back to a dim and fearful world of which few
clues remain to us the mysterious baleful creatures peopling their
archivolts and capitals seem to have come out of some fierce vision of
Cenobite temptation when the hermits of the desert fought with the
painted devils of the tombs

The apsidal capitals of Saint Pierre are a very menagerie of such
strange demonsevil beasts grinning and mocking among the stocky
saints and angels who set forth unconcerned by such hideous
propinquity the story of the birth of Christ The animals are much
more skilfully modelled than the angels and at Chauvigny one slender
monster with greyhound flanks subhuman face and long curved tail
ending in a grasping human hand haunts the memory as an embodiment of
subtle malevolence

POITIERS TO THE PYRENEES


The road from Poitiers to Angoulme carries one through a country
rolling and various in linea country with a dash of Normandy in it
but facing south instead of west

The villages are fewer than in Normandy and make less mark in the
landscape but the way passes through two drowsy little towns Civray
and Ruffec each distinguished by the possession of an important church
of the typical Romanesque of Poitou That at Civray in particular
is remarkable enough to form the object of a special pilgrimage
and to find it precisely in ones path seemed part of the general
brightness of the day Here again are the sculptured archivolt and the
rich imagery of Poitiersone strange mutilated figure of a headless
horseman dominating the front from the great arcade above the doorway
as at the church of the Sainte Croix in Bordeaux but the faade of
Civray is astonishingly topped by fifteenthcentury machicolations
which somehow in spite of their later date give it an air of greater
age of reaching back to a wild warring past

Angoulme set on a promontory between Charente and Anguienne
commands to the north south and east a vast circuit of meadowy and
woody undulations The interior of the town struck one as dull and
without characteristic detail but on the front of the twelfthcentury
cathedral perched near the ledge of the cliff above the Anguienne
detail abounds as profusely as on the faade of Notre Dame at Poitiers
It is however so much less subordinate to the general conception that
one remembers rather the garlanding of archivolts the clustering of
figures in countless niches and arcades than the fundamental lines
which should serve to bind them together and the interior roofed with
cupolas after the manner of Saint Hilaire of Poitiers is singularly
stark and barren looking

Illustration ANGOULME FAADE OF THE CATHEDRAL

But when one has paid due tribute to the cathedral one is called
on from its doorway to recognize Angoulmes other striking
distinction its splendid natural site and the way in which art has
used and made the most of it Starting from a long leafy cours with
private htels a great avenue curves about the whole length of the
walls breaking midway into a terrace boldly hung above the valley
and ending in another leafy place beneath which the slope of the
hill has been skilfully transformed into a public garden Angoulme
now thrives on the manufacture of paper and may therefore conceivably
permit herself such civic adornments but how of the many small
hilltowns of Francesuch as Laon or Thiers for instancewhich
apparently have only their past glory to subsist on yet manage to lead
up the admiring pilgrim by way of these sweeping approaches encircling
terraces and symmetrically planted esplanades One can only salute once
again the invincible French passion for form and fitness and conclude
that towns as well as nations somehow always manage to give themselves
what they regard as essential and that happy is the race to whom these
things are the essentials

On leaving Angoulme that afternoon we saw the first cypresses and
the first almond blossoms We were in the south at last not the hot
delicately pencilled Mediterranean south which has always a hint of
the East in it but the temperate Aquitanian midi cooled by the
gulf of Gascony As one nears Bordeaux the country grows less broken
the horizonline flatter but there is one really noble impression
when from the bridge of Saint Andr de Cubzac one looks out on the
lordly sweep of the Dordogne just before it merges its waters with the
Garonne to form the great estuary of the Gironde Soon after comes an
endless dusty faubourg then the long stone bridge over the Garonne
and the proud riverfront of Bordeauxa screen of eighteenthcentury
buildings stretched along the crescentshaped quay Bordeaux thus
approached has indeed as the guidebook says fort grand air and
again one returns thanks to the motor which almost always avoiding
the mean purlieus of the railway station gives one these romantic or
stately first impressions

Illustration THIERS VIEW OF THE TOWN FROM THE PONT DE SEYCHALLES

This riverfront of Bordeaux is really little more than the
architectural screen a street or two deep of a bustling bright but
featureless commercial town which from the Middle Ages to the
close of the eighteenth century seems to have crowded all its history
along the curve of the Garonne Even the early church of the Holy
Crosscontemporaneous with Notre Dame la Grande of Poitierslifts
its triple row of Romanesque arcades but a few yards from the river
and close by is Saint Michel a stately example of late Gothic with
the unusual adjunct of a detached belltower not set at an angle in
Italian fashion but facing the church squarely from a little green
enclosure across the street But these vestiges of old Bordeaux
in spite of their intrinsic interest are on the whole less
characteristic less personal than the miseenscne of its long
quay a row of fine old htels with sculptured pediments and stately
doorways broken midway by the symmetrical buildings of the Exchange
and the Custom House and extending from the Arch of Triumph opposite
the Pont de Bordeaux to the great Place des Quinconces with its
rostral columns and balustraded terrace above the river

To the modern traveller there is food for thought in the fact that
Bordeaux owes this great decorative compositionin which should be
included the theatre unfolding its majestic peristyle at the head of
the Place de la Comdieto the magnificent taste and free expenditure
of the Intendant Tourny who ruled the province of Guyenne in the
eighteenth century Except at such high moments of sthetic sensibility
as produced the monuments of Greece and republican Italy all large
schemes of civic adornment have been due to the initiative of one man
and executed without much regard to the rights of the taxpayer and
should the citizen of a modern republic too rashly congratulate himself
on exemption from the pillage productive of such results he might
with equal reason remark that the tribute lawfully extracted from him
sometimes seems to produce no results whatever

Illustration BORDEAUX CHURCH OF THE HOLY CROSS

                                   

On leaving Bordeaux we deserted the route nationale along the flat
west bank of the Garonne and recrossing the Pont de Bordeaux ran
south through the whitewine region between Garonne and Dordognethat
charming strip of country which because of the brackishness of the
river tides goes by the unexpected name of EntredeuxMers For
several miles we skirted a line of white houses half villa half
chteau set in wellkept gardens then came vineyards as exquisitely
kept and packed into every cranny of the rocky coteaux save where
here and there a little town broke the view of the riverchief among
them Langoiron with its fine fortressruin and Cadillac enclosed in
stout quadrangular walls

The latter place has the interest of being one of those symmetrically
designed towns which toward the close of the Middle Ages were founded
throughout southwestern France to draw back to the land a population
depleted and demoralised by long years of warfare and barbarian
invasion These curious madetoorder townsbastides or villes
neuveswere usually laid out on a rectilinear plan with a townhall
forming the centre of an arcaded marketplace to which four streets
led from gateways in the four walls Among the most characteristic
examples are Aigues Mortes which Saint Louis called into existence to
provide himself with a Mediterranean port and Cordes near Gaillac
founded a little later by Count Raymond of Toulouse and somewhat
ambitiously named by him after the city of Cordova

At Cadillac the specific physiognomy of the medival bastide is
overshadowed by the lofty proportions and highpitched roof of the
chteau which a sixteenthcentury Duke of Epernon planted in an
angle of the walls The adjoining parish churchitself of no mean
dimensionswas once but the private chapel of these same dukes who
have left such a large architectural impress on their small shabby
town and one grieves to learn that the chief monument of their rule
has fallen to base uses and been stripped of the fine interior
decorations which its majestic roof once sheltered

                                   

Southwest of Cadillac the road passes through a vast stretch of
pineforest with a dry aromatic undergrowthan outskirt of the great
landes that reach inward from the gulf of Gascony On and on runs
the white shadowbarred highway between ranges of red boles and
sunflecked heathy clearingsand when after long hours one emerges
from the unwonted mystery and solitude of this piny desert into the
usual busy agricultural France the land is breaking southward into
hilly waves and beyond the hills are the Pyrenees

Yet ones first real sight of themso masked are they by lesser
rangesis got next day from the terrace at Pau that astonishing
balcony hung above the great amphitheatre of southwestern France Seen
thus with the prosaic Englishprovinciallooking town at ones back
and the parklike green coteaux intervening beyond the Gave the
austere white peaks seemingly afloat in heaven for their base is
almost always lost in mist have a disconcerting look of irrelevance
of disproportion of being subjected to a kind of indignity of
inspection like caged carnivora in a zoo

And Pau on farther acquaintance utterly refuses to be brought into
any sort of credible relation with its great southern horizon conducts
itself architecturally and socially like a comfortable little spa in
a plain and rises only by a great deal of hoisting on the part of the
imaginative sightseer to the height of its own dapper brick castle
which it has domesticated into an empty desultory museum and tethered
down with a necklet of turf and flowers

But Paus real purpose is to serve as the hub of a great wheel of
which the spokes made of smooth white roads radiate away into every
fold and cleft of the country As a centre for excursions there is
no place like it in France because there is nothing in France that
quite matches the sweetness and diversity of the long Pyrenean border
Nowhere else are the pastoral and sylvan so happily mated nowhere the
villages so compact of thrift and romance the foreground so sweet the
distances so sublime and shining

Whichever way one turnsdown the winding southern valleys toward
Lourdes and Argels or to Oloron and the Eaux Chaudes westward over
low hills to the old town of Orthez and the Salies de Barn or east
again to the plain of Tarbes in its great ring of snowpeaksalways
there is the same fulness of impressions always the same brightness
and the same nobility

For a culminating instance of these impressions one might choose on
a spring afternoon the run to Lourdes by the valley of the Gave and
Btharram

First rich meadows hedgerows village streets then fields again and
hills then the brown rush of the Gave between wooded banks and
where the river threads the arch of an ivied bridge the turreted
monastery walls and pilgrimage church of Btharrama deserted
seventeenthcentury Lourdes giving one a hint of what the modern
sanctuary might have been had the millions spent on it been drawn from
the faithful when piety still walked with art

Btharram since its devotees have forsaken it is a quite negligible
sight relegated to small type even in the copious Joanne yet
in view of what is coming it is worth while to pause before its
halfSpanish halfVenetian church front and to obey the suave yet
noble gesture with which the Virgin above the doorway calls her
pilgrims in

She has only a low brown church to show with heavy stucco angels
spreading their gilded wings down a perspective of incensefogged
baroque but the image of it will come back when presently standing
under the big dome of the Lourdes Basilica one gives thanks that
modern piety chose to build its own shrine instead of laying hands on
an old one

There are two Lourdes the grey and the white The former
undescribed and unvisited is simply one of the most picturesque and
feudallooking hill villages in Europe Planted on a steep rock at the
mouth of the valley the mountains pressing it close to the west and
south it opposes its unbroken walls and stern old keep to the other
the white town sprawling on the river bankthe town of the Basilica
the Rosary the Grotto a congeries of pietistic hotels pensions
pedlars booths and panoramas where the Grand Htel du Casino or
du Palais adjoins the Pension de la Premire Apparition and the
bluesashed Vierge de Lourdes on the threshold calls attention to the
electric light and djeuner par petites tables within

Illustration BTHARRAM THE BRIDGE

Out of this vast sea of vulgarismthe more aggressive and intolerable
because its last waves break against one of the loveliest landscapes
of this lovely countryrises what the uninstructed tourist might
be pardoned for regarding as the casino of an eminently successful
wateringplaceas the Grotto beneath with its drinkingfountains
baths bottlingtaps and boutiques might stand for the Source
or Brunnen where the hypochondriac pays toll to Hygieia before
seeking relaxation in the gilded halls above For the shrine of
Bernadette has long since been overlaid by the machinery of a vast
business enterprise a scheme of life in which every heartbeat
is itemised tariffed and exploited so that even the invocations
encrusting by thousands the Basilica walls seem to record so many cases
of definite give and take so many bargains struck with heavenen
souvenir de mon vu reconnaissance pour une gurison souvenir dune
prire exauce and so onand as one turns away from this monument of
a thriving industry one may be pardoned for remembering the planetree
by the Ilissus and another invocation

Ye gods give me beauty in the inward soul and may the inner and the
outer man be one

But beyond Lourdes is Argels and at the first turn of the road one
is again in the fresh Pyrenean country among budding crops sleek
fawncoloured cattle and the grave handsome peasantry who make
one feel that the devotional ville deaux one has just left is a
mushroom growth quite unrelated to the life of industry to which these
agricultural landscapes testify

There is always an added interestarchitectural and racialabout
the border regions where the idiosyncrasies of one people run as
it were into those adjoining and a key to the character of each is
given by noting precisely what traits have survived in transplantation
The Pyreneans have a certain Spanish seriousness but so tempered by
Gallic goodhumour that their address recalls the perfectly mingled
courtesy and selfrespect of the Tuscan peasant One feels in it at
any rate the result of an old civilisation blent with independence and
simplicity of living and these bold handsome men straight of feature
and limb seem the natural product of their rich hillcountry so
disciplined by industry yet so romantically free

Illustration ARGELSGAZOST THE OLD BRIDGE

Argels is a charming old hilltown which has kept itself quite aloof
from the new wateringplace of Gazost in the plain but the real object
of the excursion lies higher up the valley in a chestnut forest on
the slope of the mountains Here the tiny village of Saint Savin
swarms beelike about its great Romanesque churcha naked massive
structure like the skeleton of some prehistoric animal half emerging
from the rock Old as it is it is rooted in remains of greater
antiquitythe fallen walls of an abbey of Charlemagnes building
itself raised the legend runs on the site of a Roman villa which once
served as the hermitage of Saint Savin son of a Count of Barcelona

It has been the fate of too many venerable architectural relics to
sacrifice their bloom of vetust to the scrupulous care which
makes them look like conscious cossetted old ladies of whom their
admiring relatives say Should you ever suspect her ageand only
in such remote monuments as that of Saint Savin does one get the
sense of undisguised antiquity of a long stolid existence exposed
to every elemental influence The result is an impression of rugged
taciturn strength and of mysterious memories striking back as in
the holywater basin of the transept and the uncouth capitals of the
chapterhouse to those dark days when Christian civilisation hung in
the balance and the horn of Roland sounded down the pass

But a medival church is always more or less in the order of nature
there is something more incongruous about a medival wateringplace
Yet the Pyrenees abound in them and at Cauterets farther up the same
valley the monks of this very monastery of Saint Savin maintained in
the tenth century habitations to facilitate the use of the baths
Of the original Cauterets however little remains and to get an
impression of an old ville deaux one must turn westward from Pau
and strike across the hills by ways of exceeding beauty to the
Salies de Barn The frequentation of these saline springs dates back
as far as the monkish charter of Cauterets and the old town of the
Salies with its incredibly picturesque halftimbered houses its black
balconies and gables above the river looks much as it must have when
in  a charter was drawn up for the regular exploitation of the
baths

Illustration SALIES DE BARN VIEW OF OLD TOWN

Pushing still farther westward one meets the highway to Bayonne and
Biarritz and may thence pass south by Saint Jean de Luz and Hendaye
to the Spanish border But the spokes of the wheel radiate in so many
different directions and lead to scenes so extraordinarily variedfrom
the savage gorge of the EauxChaudes to the smiling vale of Saint
Jean PieddePort from the romantic pass of the Pied de Roland to
Fontarrabia perched like a painted Spanish Virgin on its rock
above the gulf of Gasconythat to do them any sort of justice the
cometflight of the motor would have to be bound down to an orbit
between Bidassoa and Garonne

                                   

Familiarity cannot blunt the wonder of the climb from Pau to the crest
of the hills above Tarbes Southward the Pyrenees unfold themselves in
a long line of snows and ahead every turn of the road gives a fresh
glimpse of wood and valley of thriving villages and farms till the
last jut of the ridge shows Tarbes far off in the plain with the dim
folds of the Cvennes clouding the eastern distance

All along the northeastern skirt of the Pyrenees runs the same bright
and opulent country and at the old markettown of Montrejeau where
the Garonne cuts its way down the vale of Luchon there is just such a
fortunate grouping of hill and river and distant highperched ruin
as our grandparents admired in landscapes of the romantic school
It was our good luck to enter Montrejeau on Easter Monday while the
market was going on and the narrow streets were packed with mild
creamcoloured cattle and their lively bluesmocked drivers Great
merriment and general goodhumour marked our passage through the town
to the big inn with its open galleries and oldfashioned courtyard and
here the diningroom being as packed as the streets our table was
laid in a sunny old walled garden full of spring flowers and clipped
yews

It seemed impossible that any incident of the afternoon should be quite
at the height of this gay repast consumed in fragrance and sunshine
but we began to think differently when an hour or two later we took
the first curve of the long climb to Saint Bertrand de Comminges This
atom of a town hugging a steep wedge of rock at the mouth of the vale
of Luchon was onceand for many centuriesa diocesan seat and who
by all the spirits of incongruousness should one of its last bishops
be but the uncle of that acute and lively Madame de Boigne whose
memoirs have recently shed such light on the last days of the Old
Rgime

By no effort of imagination can one project into the single
perpendicular street of Saint Bertrand topped by its rugged Gothic
cathedral the gallant figure of Monseigneur Dillon one of those
philosophical prelates whom one instinctively places against the
lambris dors of an episcopal palace hung with Boucher tapestries
But in truth the little town has too old and strange a history to be
conscious of so fugitive an incident of its past For its foundations
were laid by the mountain tribes who harassed Pompeys legions and were
driven back by him into the valley of the Garonne and in due time
a great temple rose on what is now the rock of the cathedral Walls
and ramparts presently enclosed it and the passage of the Vandals
having swept the dwellers of the plain back into this impregnable
circuit Comminges became an episcopal city when the Catholic Church
was organised in Gaul Thereafter it underwent all the vicissitudes
of barbarian invasion falling at last into such decay that for five
hundred years it is said to have been without inhabitants Yet the
episcopal line was maintained without more than one long break and
in the eleventh century the diocese woke to life at the call of its
saintly Bishop Bertrand de lIsle Jourdain Saint Bertrand began the
cathedral and built about it the medival town which bears his name
and two hundred years later another Bertrand de Comminges raised
to the papacy as Clement V but still mindful of the welfare of his
former diocese completed the Romanesque pile by the addition of a vast
Gothic nave and choir

It is the church of Clement V that still crowns the rock of Comminges
contrasting by its monumental proportions with the handful of houses
enclosed in the walls at its base The inhabitants of Comminges
number at present but some five hundred and the town subsists the
guidebooks tell one only on its religious festivals the fame of its
monuments and the fidelity of a few old families who are kept there
par le prestige des souvenirs

One wonders climbing the steep street which of its decrepit houses
are inhabited by these interesting devotees of the past No life is
visible save that contributed by a few bleary old women squatted
under mouldering arches and a firefly dance of children about the
stony square before the church and the church itself seems withdrawn
immeasurably far into the past sunk back upon dim ancient memories of
Gaul and Visigoth

One gets an even intenser sense of these distances from the little
cloister wedged against the churchflank and overhanging the radiant
valley of the Garonnea queer cramped enceinte with squat arches
supported by monstergirdled capitals and in one case by a strange
group of battered figures supposedly the four Evangelists one of
whomthe Saint Johnis notable in Romanesque archology for bearing
in his arms the limp lamb which is his attribute

The effect of antiquity is enhanced as at Saint Savin by the
beneficent neglect which has allowed the exterior of the building
to take on all the scars and hues of age so that one comes with a
start of surprise on the rich and carefully tended interior where a
brilliant bloom of Renaissance decoration has overlaid the stout Gothic
framework

This airy curtain masking choir roodscreen and organloft in a
lacework of delicate yet hardy woodcarving has kept in the dry
Pyrenean air all its sharpness of detail acquiring only a lustre
of surface that gives it almost the texture of old bronze It is
wonderfully free and fanciful yet tempered by the southern sense of
form subdued to the main lines of the composition but breaking into
the liveliest ripples of leaf and flower of bird and sprite and angel
till its audacities culminate in the scaly undulations of the mermaids
on the terminal seats of the choircreatures of bale and beauty who
seem to have brought from across the Alps their pagan eyes and sidelong
Lombard smile

Illustration ST BERTRANDDECOMMINGES PIER OF THE FOUR EVANGELISTS
IN THE CLOISTER

The fingertailed monster of Chauvigny the plaintively real bat of the
choirstall at Poitiers and these siren evocations of a classic past
group themselves curiously in the mind as embodiments of successive
phases of human fancy imaginative interpretations of life

THE PYRENEES TO PROVENCE


As one turns northeastward from the Pyrenees the bright abundant
landscape passes gradually into a flattish greyanddrab country that
has ceased to be Aquitaine and is yet not Provence

A dull region at best this department of Haute Garonne grows
positively forbidding when the mistral rakes it whitening the
vineyards and mulberry orchards and bowing the shabby cypresses
against a confused grey sky nor is the landscape redeemed by the
sprawling silhouette of Toulousea dingy windridden city stretched
wide on the flat banks of the Garonne and hiding its two precious
buildings in a network of mean brick streets

One might venture the general axiom that France has never wholly
understood the use of brick and that where stone construction ceases
architectural beauty ceases with it Saint Sernin the great church
of Toulouse is noble enough in line and full of interest as marking
the culmination of French Romanesque but compared with the brick
churches of northern Italy it seems struck with aridity parched and
bleached as a skeleton in a desert The Capitoul with its frivolous
eighteenthcentury front has indeed more warmth and relief than any
other building in Toulouse but meanly surrounded by shabby brick
houses it seems to await in vain the development of ramps and terraces
that should lead up to its long bright faade

As the motor enters the hillcountry to the northeast of Toulouse
the land breaks away pleasantly toward the long blue line of the
Cvennes and presently a deep cleft fringed with green reveals the
nearness of the Tarnthat strange river gnawing its way through cheesy
perpendicular banks

Illustration ALBI GENERAL VIEW OF THE CATHEDRAL

Along these banks fantastic brick towns are precariously piled
LIslesurTarn with an octagonal brick belfry and Rabastens raised
on a series of bold arcaded terraces which may be viewed to advantage
from a suspensionbridge high above the river Aside from its
exceptionally picturesque site Rabastens is notable for a curious
brick church with fortified tower and muchrestored fourteenthcentury
frescoes clothing its interior like a dim richly woven tissue But
beyond Rabastens lies Albi and after a midday halt at Gaillac most
desolate and dusty of towns we pressed on again through the parched
country

Albi stood out at length upon the skya glaring mass of houses stacked
high above the deep cleft of the Tarn The surrounding landscape was
all dust and dazzle the brick streets were funnels for the swooping
wind and high up against the blinding blue rose the flanks of the
brick cathedral like those of some hairless pink monster that had just
crawled up from the river to bask on the cliff This first impression
of animal monstrosityof an unwieldly antediluvian mass of fleshis
not dispelled by a nearer approach From whatever angle one views the
astounding building its uncouth shape and fleshlike tint produce the
effect of a living organismhighbacked swollenthighed wallowinga
giant Tarasque or other anomalous offspring of the Bestiary and if
one rejects the animal analogy as too grotesque to what else may one
conceivably compare it

Among the fortified churches of southwestern France this strange
monument is the strangest as it is the most vast and none of the
accepted architectural categories seems to fit its huge vaulted hall
buttressed with tall organpipe turrets and terminating to the west in
a massive dungeonlike tower flanked by pepperpot pinnacles

The interior of the great secularlooking salle is covered by an
unbroken expanse of mural painting and encrusted overgrown almost
from the choir and ambulatory to the arches of the lateral chapels
with a prodigious efflorescence of late Gothic woodcarving and
sculpture half Spanish in its dusky greybrown magnificence But even
this excess of ecclesiastical ornament does not avail to Christianise
the churchthere is a pagan a Saracenic quality about it that seems
to overflow from its pinnacled flushed exterior

Illustration ALBI INTERIOR OF THE CATHEDRAL

To reach Carcassonne from Albi one must cross the central mass of the
Cvennes The way leads first by hill and dale through a wooded
northernlooking landscape to the town of Castres distinguished by a
charming htel de ville with a boxplanted garden said to have been
laid out by Lentre and soon after Castres the wildridged steeps
break away in widening undulations as the road throws its loops about
the sides of the Montagne Noireblack hollows deepening dizzily
below and long grey vistas unfolding between the crowded peaks
Unhappily a bourrasque enveloped us before we reached the top of the
pass so that we lost all the beauty of the long southern descent to
Carcassonne and were aware of it only as a distant tangle of lights in
the plain toward which we groped painfully through wind and rain

The rain persisted the next day but perhaps it is a not undesirable
accompaniment to a first view of Carcassonne since it eliminates that
toutandtourist element which has so possessed itself of the ancient
cit restoring to it under a grey blurred light something of its
narrow huddled medival life

He who has gone there with wrath in his heart against ViolletleDuc
may even under these mitigating conditions go so far as to think
that the universal restorer has for once been justified by his
resultsthat granting in advance the possibility of innumerable
errors of detail his brilliant hypothesis still produces a total
impression of reality Perhaps too all the floating tags of literary
medivalismthe irresistible connotations of keep and rampart and
portcullishelp out the illusion animate the serried little burgh
and people it with such figures as Dante walked among when Bellincion
Berti went girt with leather At any rate the impression is therefor
those who have the hardihood to take itthere all the more palpably
on a day of such unbroken rain when even the official custodians hug
their stove and a beneficent mist hides the stacks of postcards and
souvenirs waylaying the traveller from every window

Illustration NMES THE BATHS OF DIANA PUBLIC GARDENS

The weather however so beneficent at Carcassonne proved an obstacle
to the seeing of Narbonne and Bziers and drove us relentlessly before
it to Nmes where it gave us the next morning one of those brilliant
southern days that are born of the southern deluges Here was Provence
at lastdry clearedged classicwith a sky like blue marble low
red hills tufted by olives stony hollows with thin threads of stream
and a sun that picked out in gold the pure curves of the Maison Carre

Among the Greek towns of the Mediterranean there is none as Greekor
to speak more precisely as GrcoRomanas Nmes No other city of old
Gaul seems to have put itself so completely in harmony with its rich
nucleus of remainseliminating or omitting the monuments of other
periods and content to group its later growth subserviently about the
temple and the amphitheatre It was very well for Arles to make its
Romanesque venture for Rheims to crown itself with a glory of Gothic
but with the tranquil lines of the Maison Carre and the Nymphum
the rhythmic spring of the arena arches to act as centralising
influencesabove all with the overwhelming grandeur of the Pont du
Gard as a backgroundhow could Nmes so far more deeply pledged to
the past do otherwise than constitute herself the guardian of great
memories The Pont du Gard alone would be enough to relegate any
town to a state of ancillary subjection Its nearness is as subduing
as that of a great mountain and next to the Mont Ventoux it is the
sublimest object in Provence The solitude of its site and the austere
lines of the surrounding landscape make it appear as much on the outer
edge of civilisation as when it was first planted there and its long
defile of arches seems to be forever pushing on into the wilderness
with the tremendous tread of the Roman legions

By one of the charming oppositions of French travel one may return
from this classic pilgrimage through the medival town of Uzs and
as if such contrasts were not fruitful enough may pause on the way
to smile at the fantastic chteau dAngivilliersa halfruined
eighteenthcentury Folly with an anachronistic medley of kiosks
arcades pagodas a chapel like a Roman temple and a ruined boxgarden
haunted by peacocks

Illustration CARCASSONNE THE PORTE DE LAUDE

Uzs itself a steep town clustered about the ducal keep of the
Crussols has a stately terrace above the valley and some fine
eighteenthcentury houses in shabby streets insufficiently swept but
its chief feature is of course the castle which planted protectingly
in the centre of the town thrusts up its central dungeon over a
fine feudal jumble of subsidiary masonry

From Nmes to the Mediterranean the impressions are packed too thick
First the Rhone with the castles of Tarascon and Beaucaire taunting
each other across its yellow flood Beaucaire from a steep cliff
Tarascon from the very brink of the river then after a short flight
through oliveorchards and vineyards the pretty leafy town of Saint
Remy on the skirts of the Alpilles and a mile to the south of Saint
Remy on a chalky ledge of the low mountainchain the two surviving
monuments of the Roman city of Glanum They are set side by side
the tomb and the triumphal arch in a circular grassy space enclosed
with oliveorchards and backed by delicate fretted peaks not another
vestige of Roman construction left to connect them with the past Was
it one wonders their singular beauty that saved them that held
even the Visigoths hands when they wiped out every other trace of
the populous city of stonequarriers with its aqueducts walls and
temples Certainly seeing the two buildings thus isolated under the
radiant lonely sky one is tempted to exclaim that they might well
have checked even barbarian violence and that never again did the
stout Roman trunk throw out two such flowers of grace and lightness It
is as though from that packed Provenal soil some dust of Greece had
passed into the Latin stem clearing a little its thick sap yet it is
just because the monuments remain so sturdily Roman that the grace and
the lightness count so much

This Alpilles country between Rhone and Durance is itself the most
Grecian thing west of Greece Provence of Provence in every line of its
bare sharpcut heights tufted with a spare classic growth of olive
cistus and myrtle it explains why the Greek colonist found himself at
home on these ultimate shores and why the Roman conqueror bowed here
to Attic influences

Pushing southeast from Saint Remy one comes through a broadening
landscape to the old town of Salon where Nostradamus is buried and
thence by a winding road among the hills to the wide valley where
AixenProvence lies encircled in mountains

Illustration SAINTREMY THE MAUSOLEUM

For a town so nobly seated it seems at first approach a little
commonplace and insignificant the eye lighting on it from the
heights seeks a skyline like that of Clermont or Prigueux Aix
in this respect remains inadequate yet presents itself to closer
inspection as a charming faded old place tinged with legal and
academic memories with a fine double row of balconied and sculptured
htels along its leafy cours and a number of scattered treasures in
the folds of its crooked streets

Among these treasures the two foremostthe picture of the Buisson
Ardent in the cathedral and the Gobelin tapestries in the adjoining
Archbishops palacebelong to such widely sundered schools that
they might almost be said to represent the extreme points within
which French art has vibrated It is therefore the more interesting
to note that both are intrinsically and preminently decorative in
qualitydevotional triptych and frivolous tapestry obeying the same
law of rigorously balanced lines and colours The great picture of the
Burning Bush is with the exception of the Virgin of Moulins perhaps
the finest flower of that early French school of painting which was so
little known or considered that until the recent Paris exhibition of
Primitives many of its masterpieces were complacently attributed to
Italian painters Hanging midway down the nave where a golden light
strikes it when the sacristan flings open the splendid carved doors of
the west front the triptych of Nicholas Froment unfolds itself like a
great threepetalled flower each leaf burning with a rich limpidity of
colour that overflows from the Rosa Mystica of the central panel to the
pale prayerful faces of the royal donators in the wings

The cathedral has its tapestries alsoa series from the Brussels
looms attributed to Quentin Matsys and covering the choir with
intricately composed scenes from the life of Christ in which the
melancholy greygreen of autumn leaves is mingled with deep jewellike
pools of colour But these are accidental importations from another
world whereas the famous Don Quixote series in the Archbishops palace
represents the culminating moment of French decorative art

They strike one perhaps first of allthese rosy chatoyantes
compositions where ladies in loosened bodices gracefully prepare to
be surprisedas an instructive commentary on ecclesiastical manners
toward the close of the eighteenth century then one passes on to
abstract enjoyment of their colourscheme and balance of line to a
delighted perception of the way in which they are kept from being

imprisonedyet so freein that fanciful textile world which has its
own flora and fauna its own laws of colour and perspective and its

From Aix to the Mediterranean the southeastern highway passes through
a land of everincreasing loveliness East of Aix the barepeaked
mountain of Sainte Victoire dominates the fertile valley for long
miles Then the hermithaunted range of the Sainte Baume unfolds its
wooded flanks to the south the highway skirting them as it gradually
mounts to the plateau where the town of Saint Maximin in clusters about
its unfinished Dominican churcha remarkable example of northern
Gothic strayed into the classic confines of Provence

Saint Maximin owes its existenceor that part of it contingent on
possessing so important a churchto the ownership of the bones of
Saint Mary Magdalen whose supposed relics were formerly venerated in
the great Burgundian church of Vzelay but in the thirteenth century
were officially identified among the treasures of the Provenal town
As the penitent saint is supposed to have spent her last years in a
grotto on the heights of the Sainte Baume it seems more fitting that
she should now rest at its foot than on the faroff rock of the Morvan
and one is glad that the belief was early enough established to produce
the picturesque anomaly of this fine fragment of northern art planted
against the classic slopes of the Maritime Alps

The great Gothic church was never finished without or within but in
the seventeenth century a renewal of devotion to Saint Mary Magdalen
caused the interior of the choir to be clothed with a magnificent
revtement of woodcarving in the shape of ninetytwo choirstalls
recounting in their sculptured medallions the history of the Dominican
order and leading up to a sumptuous Berniniesque highaltar all
jasper porphyry and shooting rays of gold

Illustration ST MAXIMIN CHOIR STALLS IN THE CHURCH

Saint Maximin though lying so remotely among bare fields and barer
mountains still shows outside its church some interesting traces
of former activity and importance A stout old Dominican monastery
extends its long row of ogival windows near the church and here and
there a vigorous bit of ancient masonry juts from the streetsnotably
in the sprawling arcades of the Jewish quarter and where certain
fragments of wall attest that the mountain village was once a strongly
defended medival town

Beyond Saint Maximin the route nationale bears away between the
mountains to Nice but at Brignolesa city of old renown the
winter residence of the Counts of Provenceone may turn southward
by Roquebrussanne and the Chartreuse of Montrieux where Petrarchs
brother was abbot to the radiant valley of the Gapeau where the
streamside is already white with cherryblossoms and so at length
come out at Hyres on the full glory of the Mediterranean spring

Ones first feeling is that nothing else matches itthat no work of
man no accumulated appeal of history can contend a moment against
this joy of the eye so prodigally poured out The stretch of coast from
Toulon to Saint Tropez so much less familiar to northern eyes than
the more eastern portion of the Riviera has a peculiar nobility a
Virgilian breadth of composition in marked contrast to the redrocked
precipitous landscape beyond Looking out on it from the pinewoods of
Costebelle above Hyres one is beset by classic allusions analogies
of the golden ageso divinely does the green plain open to the sea
between mountain lines of such Attic purity

After packed weeks of historic and archological sensation this
surrender to the spell of the landscape tempts one to indefinite
idling It is the season when through the winter verdure of the
Riviera spring breaks with a hundred tender tintspale green of
crops white snow of fruitblossoms and fire of scarlet tulips under
the grey smoke of olivegroves From heights among the corktrees
the little towns huddled about their feudal keeps blink across the
pineforests at the dazzling blueandpurple indentations of the
coast And between the heights mild valleys widen downvalleys with
fields of roses acres of budding vine meadows sown with narcissus
and cold streams rushing from the chestnut forests below the bald grey
peaks Among the peaks are lonely hermitages ruined remains of old
monastic settlements Carthusian and Benedictine but no great names
are attached to these fallen shrines and the little towns below have
no connection with the main lines of history It is all a tranquil
backwater thick with local tradition little floating fragments of
association and legend but art and history seem to have held back from
it as from some charmed Elysian region too calm too complete to be
rudely touched to great issues

                                   

It was the mistral that drove us from this Eden poisoning it with
dust and glare and causing us to take refuge north of the seaboard
Alps There in a blander air and on a radiant morning we left Aix
behind and followed the Durance to Avignon Approaching the papal
city from the east one may get a memorable impression by following
the outer circuit of its walls to the Porte de lOuille which opens
on the Place Crillon just below the great rock of the palace Seen
thus from without Avignon is like a toy model of a medival city
and this impression of artificial completeness is renewed when from
the rockperched terrace below the palace one looks out on the Rhone
valley and its enclosing amphitheatre of mountains In the light
Provenal air which gives a finely pencilled precision to the remotest
objects the landscape has an extraordinarily topographical character
an effect of presenting with a preRaphalite insistence on detail its
sharpedged ruins its turreted bridge its little walled towns on
definite points of rock The river winding through the foreground holds
its yellow curve between thin fringes of poplar and sharp calcareous
cliffs and even the remoter hills have the clear silhouette of the
blue peaks in medival miniatures the shoulder of the Mont Ventoux
rising above them to the north with the firmness of an antique marble

Illustration TOULON THE HOUSE OF PUGET

This southern keenness of edge gives even to the Gothicism of the
piledup church and palace an exotic transAlpine quality and makes
the long papal ownership of Avignonlasting it is well to remember
till the general upheaval of a visible and intelligible fact
Though the Popes of Avignon were Frenchmen Avignon is unmistakably
almost inexplicably Italian its Gothic vaguely suggests that of
the Ponte Sant Angelo of the fortified arches and tombs of medival
Rome and reconciles itself as easily to the florid faade of the
seventeenthcentury Papal Mint in the square below as to the delicate
classic detail of the west door of the church

Romebut Imperial not Papal Romewas still in the air as we left
Avignon and followed the Rhone valley northward to Orange All this
part of France is thick with history and in the ancient principality
of Orange the layers are piled so deep that one wonders to see so few
traces of successive dominations in the outward aspect of its capital
Only the Rome of the Emperors has left a mark on the town which lived
with so vigorous and personal life from the days when it was a Gaulish
city and a trading station of Massaliote Greeks and which when it
grew too small for its adventurous brood sent rulers to both shores
of the North Sea and the fact that the theatre and the arch survive
while the Orange of Carlovingian bishops and medival princes has been
quite wiped out and even Maurice of Nassaus great seventeenthcentury
fortress razed to the groundthis permanence of the imperial
monuments rising unshaken through the blown dust of nearly a thousand
years gives a tangible image of the way in which the Roman spirit has
persisted through the fluctuations of history

To learn that these very monuments have been turned to base uses by
barbarous princebishopsthe arch converted into a fortified Chteau
de lArc the theatre into an outwork of the main fortressadds
impressiveness to their mutilated splendour awing one with the image
of a whole reconstructed from such fragments

Illustration ORANGE THE ARCH OF MARIUS

Among these the theatre now quite stripped of ornament produces its
effect only by means of its size and of the beautiful sweep of its
converging lines but the great goldenbrown archstanding alone in a
wide grassy squarekeeps on three sides a Corinthian mask of cornice
and column and a rich embossing of fruit and flowergarlands of
sirens trophies and battlescenes All this decoration is typically
Romanvigorously carved and somewhat indiscriminately applied One
looks in vain for the sensitive ornament of the arch of Saint Remy in
which Mrimes keen eye saw a germ of the coming Gothic the sculpture
of Orange follows the conventional lines of its day without showing
a hint of new forms But that very absence of imaginative suggestion
makes it Roman and imperial to the core

Ahead of us all the way from Avignon to Orange the Mont Ventoux
lifted into the pure light its denuded flanks and wrinkled
silverylilac summit But at Orange we turned about its base and bore
away northeastward through a broken country rimmed with hills passing
by Tulette the seat of a Cluniac foundationof which the great
Rovere Julius II was Prince and Priorand by Valras which under
the Popes of Avignon became the capital of the Haut Comtat the French
papal dominion in France

Like too many old towns in this part of France Valras once a
strongly fortified place has suffered its castle to fall in ruins
and swept away its towers and ramparts to make room for boulevards as
though eager to efface all traces of its long crowded past But one
such tracenearer at hand and of more intimate connotationsremains
in the Htel de Simiane now the htel de ville but formerly the
house of that Marquis de Simiane who married Pauline de Grignan the
granddaughter of Madame de Svign

This is the first reminder that we are in the Grignan country and
that a turn of the road will presently bring us in full view of that
highperched castle where the great lieutenantgovernor of Provence
Madame de Svigns soninlaw dispensed an almost royal hospitably
and ruled with more than royal arrogance

Illustration GRIGNAN GATE OF THE CASTLE

The Comte de Grignan was counted a proud man and there was much to
foster pride in the site and aspect of his ancestral castlece
chteau royal de Grignan If Italy and papal Italy has been in
ones mind at every turn of the way from Avignon to Tulette it seems
actually to rise before one as the great ruin springing suddenly from
its cliff in the plain evokes a not too audacious comparison with the
rock of Caprarola In France at least there is perhaps nothing as
suggestive of the fortified pleasurehouses of Italy as this gallant
castle on the summit of its rock with the town clustering below and
the vast terrace before it actually forming the roof of its church And
the view from the terrace has the same illimitable sunwashed spaces
flowing on every side into noble mountainforms from the Mont
Ventoux in the south to the range of the Ardche in the west

The ancient line of Adhmar created Counts of Grignan by Henri II
had long been established on their rocky pedestal when they built
themselves in the sixteenth century the magnificent Renaissance
faade of which only the angle towers now subsist Later still they
added the great gallery lined with fulllength portraits of the
Adhmar and under Louis XIV Mansart built the socalled Faade des
Prlats which judging from its remains did not yield in stateliness
to any of the earlier portions of the castle From this side a fine
flight of double steps still descends to a garden set with statues and
fountains and beyond it lies the vast stone terrace which forms the
roof of the collegial church and is continued by a chemin de ronde
crowning the lofty ramparts on the summit of the rock

This princely edifice remained in unaltered splendour for sixty years
after the house of Adhmar in the person of Madame de Svigns
grandson had died out ruined and diminished in  But when the
Revolution broke old memories of the Comte de Grignans dealings with
his peopleof unpaid debts extorted loans obscure lives devoured by
the greedy splendour on the rockall these recollections of which one
may read the record in various family memoirs no doubt increased the
fury of the onslaught which left the palace of the Adhmar a blackened
ruin If there are few spots in France where one more deeply resents
the senseless havoc of the Revolution there are few where on second
thoughts one so distinctly understands what turned the cannon on the
castle

The soninlaw of Madame de Svign was the most exorbitant as he
was the most distinguished of his race and it was in him that the
splendour and disaster of the family culminated But probably no
visions of future retribution disturbed the charming woman who spenta
victim to her maternal passionher last somewhat melancholy years in
the semiregal isolation of Grignan No one but La Bruyre seems in
that day to have noticed the swarthy livid animal crouched over
the soil which he digs and turns with invincible obstinacy but who
when he rises to his feet shows a human countenancecertainly he
could not be visible toiling so far below from that proud terrace of
the Adhmar which makes the church its footstool Least of all would
he be perceptible to the eyeson other lines so discerningof the
lady whose gaze when not on her daughters face remained passionately
fixed on the barrier of northern mountains and the highway that ran
through them to Paris Paris Grignan seems far enough from it even
nowwhat an Ultima Thule a land of social night it must have been
in the days when Madame de Svigns heavy travelling carriage had to
bump over six hundred miles of rutty road to reach the doors of the
Htel Carnavalet One had to suffer Grignan for ones adored daughters
saketo put up as best one could with the clumsy civilities of
the provincial nobility and to console ones self by deliciously
ridiculing the pretensions of Aix societybut it was an exile after
all and the ruined rooms of the castle and the long circuit of the
chemin de ronde are haunted by the wistful figure of the poor
lady who though in autumn she could extol the sugary white figs
the Muscats golden as amber the partridges flavoured with thyme and
marjoram and all the scents of our sachets yet reached her highest
pitch of eloquence when with stiff fingers and shuddering pen she
pictured the unimaginable February cold the awful beauty of winter
the furious unchained Rhone and the mountains charming in their
excess of horror

IV

THE RHONE TO THE SEINE


From Montlimar to Lyons the great north road to Paris follows almost
continuously the east shore of the Rhone looking across at the feudal
ruins that stud the opposite cliffs The swift turns of the river and
the fantastic outline of these castlecrowned rocks behind which hang
the blue lines of the Cvennes compose a foreground suggestive in its
wan colour and abrupt masses of the pictures of Patinier the strange
Flemish painter whose ghostly calcareous landscapes are said to have
been the first in which scenery was painted for scenerys sake In all
the subtler elements of beauty as well as in the power of historic
suggestion this Rhone landscape far surpasses that of the Rhine but
like many of the most beautiful regions of France it has a quality of
aloofness of almost classic reserve that defends it from the inroads
of the throng

Midway to Lyons Valence the capital of Csar Borgias Valentinois
rises above the river confronted on the opposite shore by a wild
cliff bearing the ruined stronghold of Crussol the cradle of the house
of Uzs The compact little Romanesque cathedral of Saint Etienne
scantily adorned by the light exterior arcade of its nave is seated
on an open terrace overlooking the Rhone As sober but less mellow
within it offersaside from the monument to Pius VI who ended
his troubled days hereonly the comparatively recondite interest of
typical constructive detail and the impressionist sightseer is likely
to wander out soon to the little square beyond the apse

Here stands Le Pendentif a curious little vaulted building of the
Renaissance full of the note of character though its original purpose
seems to be the subject of archological debate Like many buildings
of this part of the Rhone valley it was unhappily constructed of a
stone on which the wear of the weather might suggest the literal action
of the tooth of Timeso scarred and gnawed is the whole charming
fabric As to its original use it appears to have been the mortuary
chapel of the noble family whose arms are discernible among the
incongruous animals of its decaying sculpture for it is part of the
strangeness of the little monument that the spandrils of its elegant
classic order are inhabited by a rude Romanesque fauna which combined
with the dusky hue and ravaged surface of the stone confers on it in
contrast to the rejuvenated church a look of mysterious antiquity

A few yards off down a dark narrow street the same savour of the
past is found in one of those minor relics which let the observer
so much deeper into bygone institutions than the study of their
official monuments This is simply an old private house of the early
Renaissance with a narrow sculptured courtyard a twisting staircase
and vaulted stone passages and rooms of singularly robust construction
It is stillappropriately enoughinhabited by une trs vieille dame
who has receded so deeply into the farthest convolution of her stout
stone shell that her friendly portress had leave to conduct us from
basement to attic giving us glimpses of dusky chambers with meagre
venerable furniture and of kitchens and offices with stone floors
scoured coppers and pots of herbs all so saturated with the old
concentrated life of provincial France that it was like lifting to
ones lips a glass of some ancient wine just at the turningpoint of
its perfection

Illustration VIENNE GENERAL VIEW OF THE TOWN

Not far from Valence Tournon springs romantically from a cliff of the
west bank surmounted by the ducal castle of Soubise and the next
strong impression comes where Vienne proudest of Rhone towns lifts
its flamboyant cathedral on a vast flight of steps above the river
The site of Vienne and its long Roman past prepare one for more
interest of detail than a closer inspection reveals The Roman temple
which may once have rivalled the Maison Carre was in the Middle Ages
like the temple of Syracuse incorporated in a Christian church and
now extricated lifeless from this fatal embrace presents itself as
an impersonal block of masonry from which all significance of detail
is gone The cathedral too has suffered in the same way though
from other causes In its early days it was savagely mutilated by the
Huguenots and since then the weather eating deeply into its friable
stone has wrought such havoc with the finery and frippery of the
elaborate west front that the exterior attracts attention only as a
stately outline

All the afternoon we had followed the Rhone under a cloudy sky and
as we crossed the river at Vienne the clouds broke and we pushed
northward through a deluge Our day had been a long one with its large
parenthesis at Grignan and the rainy twilight soon closed in on us
blotting out the last miles of the approach to Lyons But even this
disappointment had its compensations for in the darkness we took a
wrong turn coming out on a high suburb of the west bank with the
city outspread below in a wide network of lights against its holy hill
of Fourvire Lyons passes I believe for the most prosaic of great
French towns but no one can so think of it who descends on it thus
through the night seeing its majestic bridges link quay to quay and
the double sweep of the river reflecting the million lights of its
banks

                                   

It was still raining when we continued on our journey the next day but
the clouds broke as we climbed the hill above Lyons and we had some
fine backward glimpses of the Rhone before our road began to traverse
the dull plain of the Bresse

    So rest for ever rest O princely pair

If the lines have pursued one from childhood the easiestand alas
the most finalway of laying their lovely spectre is to turn aside
from the road to Dijon and seek out the church of Brou To do so one
must journey for two or three hours across one of the flat stretches of
central France and the first disillusionment comes when Brou itself
is found to be no more than a faubourg of the old capital of the
Bressethe big busy cheesemaking town of Bourg sprawling loosely
among boundless pastures and detaining one only by the graceful
exterior of its somewhat heterogeneous church

A straight road runs thence through dusty outskirts to the shrine of
Margaret of Austria and the heart of the sentimentalist sank as we
began to travel it Here indeed close to the roadside stood the new
pile looking as new as it may have when from her white palfrey the
widowed Duchess watched her Flemish carvers Lombard gilders at work
looking in fact as scrubbed scraped and soaped as if its renovation
were a feat daily performed by the seven maids with seven mops on
whose purifying powers the walrus so ingeniously speculated Matthew
Arnolds poem does not prepare the reader for the unnatural gloss which
makes the unhappy monument look like a celluloid toy Perhaps when he
saw it the cleansing process had not begunbut did he ever really see
it And if so where did he see the

    Savoy mountain meadows
    By the stream below the pines

And how could he have pictured the Duchess Margaret as being in the
mountains while she was supervising the work Or the Alpine peasants
as climbing up to pray at the completed shrine or the priest
ascending to it by the mountainway from the walled town below the
pass

Is Bourg the walled town and its dusty faubourg the pass And shall
we when we pass under the traceries of the central door and stand
beneath the vaulting of the nave hear overhead the wind washing
through the mountain pines It will have to travel a long way to make
itself heard

Poor Lady Mary Wortley Montagu so maligned for her imaginative
pictures of Lovere and Lake Iseo may surely be forgiven for having
gilded the lily for adding an extra touch of romance where the
romantic already so abounded but it is less easy to explain how the
poet of the church of Brou could evoke out of the dusty plain of the
Bresse his pinewoods streams and mountains Perhaps the pilgrim
reflects the explanation will be found within the church and standing
in the magic light of the vast western window we too shall hear the
washing of the wind in the pines and understand why it travelled so
far to reach the poets ear

Illustration BROU TOMB OF MARGARET OF AUSTRIA IN THE CHURCH

In this hope we enter but only to discover that inside also the
archological mops have been at work and that the elaborate lining
of the shrine is as scoured and shiny as its exterior Well let us
affront this last disenchantmentand the little additional one of
buying a ticket for the choir from a goldbraided custodian at a desk
in the naveand closing our eyes to the secularised museumised aspect
of the monument try to open them to a vision of what it may have
been before it was turned into a show

Alas even this last effortthis bon mouvement of the
imaginationfails to restore an atmosphere of poetry to the church of
Brou to put it in any other light than that of a kind of superlative
Albert Memorial in which regardlessness of cost has frankly
predominated over sthetic considerations Yet it is manifestly unfair
to charge the Duchess Margaret with the indiscrimination of the
parvenu One should rather ascribe to special conditions of time and
place that stifling confusion of ornament that air of being as Bacon
puts it so terribly daubed with cost which is both the first effect
and the final outcome of an inspection of Brou If Arnold gave the
rein to fancy in his miseenscne he was quite exact in picturing
the conditions in which the monument was produced and his enumeration
of the Flemish carvers Lombard gilders German masons smiths from
Spain who collaborated in its making reminds one that artistic
unity could hardly result from so random an association of talents
It was characteristic of the time of the last boilingover of the
heterogeneous Gothic pot that this strange fellowship was not felt to
be any obstacle to the production of a work of art One sees the same
result in almost all the monuments of the period especially where the
SpanishNetherlands influence has added a last touch of profusionand
confusion How could an art so evolved issue in anything but a chaos of
overdone ornament How could line survive in such a deluge of detail
The church of Brou is simply the most distressing because the most
expensive product of the period Expiring Gothic changed its outline
as often as the dying dolphin is supposed to change his coloursevery
ornament suggests a convulsion in stone

And on all this extravagance of design which could be real redeemed
only by the lightest touch of the chisel lies the heavy hand of the
Flemish sculptor Is it possible that the same phase of artistic
feeling produced the three tombs of Brou and those of the Dukes of
Burgundy at Dijon Certainly at least the same hand did not carve
them At Brou the innumerable subordinate figuresangels mourners
and the restare turned out with the unerring facility of the
pastrycooks art they represent the highest achievement in sugar
and white of egg At Dijon on the contrary each pleureur in the
arcade beneath the tomb of Duke Philip is a living sentient creature
a mourner whose grief finds individual utterance Is there anything
in plastic art that more vividly expresses the passionate medival
brooding over death Each little cowled figure takes his grief his
sense of the nant in his own way Some are wrung and bowed with
it One prays Another a serene young man walks apart with head bent
above his bookthe page of a Stoic one conjectures And so each in
his few inches of marble and in the confinement of his cramped little
niche typifies a special aspect of the sense of mortalityabove all
of its loneliness the way it must be borne without help

                                   

The thought came to one the next day at Dijon the more vividly by
contrast to the simpering sorrow of Brou The tombs of the dukes of
Burgundy so cruelly torn from the hallowed twilight of the Chartreuse
and exposed to the cold illumination of museum windows give one even
in this impersonal light a strong sense of personality Even the
overladen detail of the period the aimless striving of its frets and
finials cannot obscure the serious purity of the central conception
and one is led to the conclusion that a touch of free artistic emotion
will break through the strongest armour of stock formulas

One sees them of course the ducal tombs in a setting in a certain
sense their own since this privileged city in addition to its other
distinctions has a medival palace for its museum and the mailed
heels of the recumbent dukes may have rung on the stone flagging of the
Salle des Gardes where they now lie But the great vaulted hall has
ceased to be a guardroom as they have ceased to be its lords and the
trail of label and number of velvet cord and iron rail is everywhere
in their democratised palace It is noteworthy therefore that as the
tombs have retained so much of their commemorative value so the palace
itself has yielded as little as might be of its private character to
the encroachments of publicity appearing almost as one wanders from
one bright room to another like the house of a great collector who
still lives among his treasures

Illustration DIJON MOURNERS ON THE TOMB OF JEAN SANS PEUR

This felicitous impression is partly due to the beauty of the old
building and partly also to the fact that it houses a number of small
collections the spoils of local dilettanti each kept together
however diversified its elements so that many of the rooms exhibit a
charming habitable mingling of old furniture old porcelain and the
small unobtrusive pictures that are painted to be lived with not
glanced up at from a catalogue

The impression of happy coincidences of really providential accidents
which gives such life to the bright varied museum persists and deepens
as one passes from it into the townthe astonishing town which seems
to sum up in itself almost every phase of French art and history Even
the deep soil of France has hardly another spot where the past grows so
thick and so vigorously where the ancient growths lift such hale heads
to the sunlight The continuity of life at Dijon is as striking as its
diversity and its individuality Old Dijon is not an archipelago of
relics in a sea of modern houses it is like a vascular system binding
the place together in its network of warm veins and seeming not to be
kept alive but to be keeping life in the city

It is to this vivid synthesis of the past that one reverts from even
the strongest single impressionsfrom the civic sumptuousness of the
Palais de Justice the elegance of the Htel de Vogu the mysterious
symbolism of the jutting row of gargoyles on the west front of Notre
Damesuffering them to merge themselves these and many more into
a crowded splendid tapestry the mere background of the old citys
continuous drama of ducal Imperial parliamentary life

The same impression of richness of deep assimilated experience
accompanies one on the way north through the Burgundian
provincegiving to the trivial motorist the mere snarer of haphazard
impressions so annihilating a sense of his inability to render even
a superficial account of what he sees and feels beneath the thing
seen that there comes a moment when he is tempted to take refuge
in reporting the homely luxury of the innsthough even here the
abundance of matter becomes almost as difficult to deal with

It is for this reason perhaps that after a morning among the hills
and valleys of the Morvan in sight almost continuously of that
astonishing Burgundian canal with its long lines of symmetrical
poplars its massive masonry its charming lockhouses all repeating
themselves like successive states of a precious etchingthat after
such a morning I seek and seem to find its culminating astonishment
in the luncheon which crowned it in the grimy diningroom of the
auberge at PrcysousThil But was it an auberge even and not
rather a gargote this sandy onionscented public with waggoners
and soldiers grouped cheerfully about their petit vin bleu while a
flushed handmaid in repeated dashes from the kitchen laid before us
a succession of the most sophisticated dishesthe tenderest filet the
airiest pommes souffles the plumpest artichokes that ever bloomed
on the buffet of a Parisian restaurant It corresponded at any rate
to the kind of place where in any AngloSaxon country one would have
found the company as prohibitory as the food and each equally a reason
for fleeing as soon as possible from the other

So it is that PrcysousThil may stand as a modest symbol of the
excessive amenity of this mellowest of French civilisationsthe more
memorably to one party of hungry travellers because it formed at the
same time the final stage of their pilgrimage to Vzelay

That thought indeed distracted us from the full enjoyment of the
filet and tore us from the fragrant coffee that our panting waitress
carried after us to the motors edge for more than half the short
April day was over and we had still two hours of steep hill and vale
between ourselves and Vzelay

The remainder of the way carried us through a region so romantically
broken so studded with sturdy old villages perched on high ledges or
lodged in narrow defiles that but for the expectation before us every
mile of the way would have left an individual impression But on the
road to Vzelay what can one see but Vzelay Nothing certainly less
challenging to the attention than the loftily seated town of Avallon
which midway of our journey caught and detained us for a wondrous
hour

Illustration AVALLON GENERAL VIEW OF THE TOWN

The strain of our timelimit and the manifold charms of the old town
so finely planted above the gorge of the Cousin had nearly caused us
to defer Vzelay and end our days journey at the Htel du Chapeau
Rouge But in the mild air and on the extreme verge of the bright
sky there was a threat of rain and the longing to see the great
Benedictine abbey against such a sunset as the afternoon promised was
even stronger than the spell of Avallon We carried away therefore
with the fixed intention of returning only the general impression of
a walled town set against a striking background of cliff and woodland
and one small vivid vignette of a deserted square where aged houses of
incredible picturesqueness grouped themselves at scenic angles about
the sculptured front of the church of Saint Lazare

From Avallon to Vzelay the road winds to the west between the leafy
banks of the Cousin through the town of Pontaubert with its ancient
church of the Templars past the bridge of the Cure and out at last
into the valley dominated by the conical hill of Vzelay All day the
vision of the Benedictine church had hung before us beyond each bend of
the road and when at length we saw its mighty buttresses and towers
clenched in the rock above the roofs and walls of the abbatial town
we felt the impact of a great sensationfor the reality was nobler
than the vision

The mere sight of Vzelay from the valleyquite apart from the rush
of associations it sets freeproduces the immediate effect of one of
those perfect achievements in which art and nature interpret and fulfil
each other The church stands just where such a building should stand
and looks as a building should look to be worthy of such a site The
landscape about it has the mingled serenity and ruggedness which its
own lines express and its outline grows out of the hilltop without a
break between the structural harmony of the two

Illustration VZELAY NARTHEX OF THE CHURCH OF THE MADELEINE

Before mounting up to compare the detailed impression with the first
effect one is detained by the village of Saint Pre Pierre sous
Vzelay which lies just at the foot of the road leading up to the
abbey Here from a heap of sordid houses and among stifling barnyard
exhalations rises the sweet worn old church of Saint Pierre younger
in date than the abbey church above but stained and seamed by time
From the stone embroideries of its triple porch and its graceful
fantastic narthex it might pass at first glance for a more than
usually temperate specimen of flamboyant Gothic but if one backs away
far enough to take in its whole outline the upper faade and the
tower reveal themselves as an exquisite instance of thirteenthcentury
transition The tower in particular with its light ranges or arcades
and the slender trumpeting angels that so surprisingly buttress its
angles seems as an observant traveller has already noted more
Italian than Burgundianthough to find its match in Italy one would
have to seek not among actual churchtowers but in the backgrounds of
early Tuscan pictures where against a sky of goldleaf such heralds
sound their call from the thatch of the manger

After the mystical vision of the belltower of Saint Pre it is almost
a drop back to prose to climb the hill to Vzelay and stand before
the church of the Magdelenor rather it is like turning from the
raptures of Joachim of Flora or Hugo of Saint Victor to the closeknit
dialectic of Saint Thomas Aquinas This vast creation of medival faith
might indeed be likened to the great doctrinal system out of which it
grewsuch a strong tight complex structure so studied balanced
and mathematically exact it seems

It has seen the great church in its wellnigh thousand years of
existence sights so splendid and memorable that it seems at first a
mere background for its memoriesfor the figures of Saint Bernard and
Becket of Philip Augustus and Cur de Lion with their interminable
train of clerical and secular dignitaries monks nobles doctors of
the Church and all the wild impassioned rout of the second and third
Crusades To have seen so much and now to stand so far apart from
life One reflects on the happier fate of those other great churches of
lay growth the French cathedrals whose hearts beat warm for so many
centuries through so many social and political alternations

The situation of the church of Vzelay typifies this deeper solitude
It stands alone on the crest of the hill divided from the town
below by a wide stony square Behind the apse where the monastic
buildings lay a shady grassy slope simulates the privacy of an
English closeand on all sides are the blue distances of the Morvan
This loftiness and detachment of site give a peculiar majesty to
the building and conduce no doubt to the impression that in all
church architecture there is nothing quite like it nothing in which
the passive strength of the elder style so imperceptibly blends with
the springing grace of the new The latter meets one first in the
twostoried narthex a church in itself which precedes the magnificent
roundarched portals of the inner building It is from the threshold of
this narthex that looking down its lofty vista and through the triple
doorways to the vast and stern perspective of the Romanesque nave one
gets the keenest impression of the way in which in this incomparable
building the two styles have been wrought into an accord that shows
their essential continuity In the nave itself with the doors of the
narthex closed another subtler impression awaits one for here one
seems to surprise the actual moment of transition to see as nowhere
else the folded wings of the Gothic stirring under the older forms

More even than its rich mysterious sculptures far more than its mere
pride of size and majesty does this undefinable fremissement of the
old static Romanesque lines remain with one as the specific note of
Vzelay giving it in spite of its agelong desertion in spite of
the dead and staring look produced by indiscriminate restoration an
inner thrill of vitality the promise of strange futures beautiful and
young such as the greatest art alone possesses

The long spring sunset filled the sky when we turned from Vzelay and
began to wind through the valley of the Cure to Auxerre The day had
been too rich in impressions to leave space for more than a deep sense
of changing loveliness as we followed the curves of the river through
poplarplanted meadows by white chalkcliffs and villages hanging on
the heights But among these fugitive impressions is the vivid memory
of a white railway viaduct so lightly yet securely flung across the
valley that in the golden blur of sunset it suggested one of Turners
dreambridges spanning a vale of Tempe a notable instance of the
almost invariable art with which in French engineering the arch is
still employed After that the way grew indistinct and night had
fallen when we entered Auxerrefeeling our way through a dimly lit
suburb seeing the lights of the town multiplied in the quiet waters of
the Yonne and reaching it at last by a bridge that led straight to
the steep central street

                                   

Auxerre the next dayeven through the blinding rain which so
punctually confirmed our forebodingsrevealed itself as one of those
closeknit individual old French towns that are as expressive as full
of vivacity and character as certain French faces Finely massed above
the river in a pile culminating with the towers of the cathedral and
the detached shaft of Saint Jean it confirms and indeed exceeds on
a nearer view the promise of its distant aspect A town which has had
the good fortune to preserve its walls and one or two of its fortified
gates has alwaysand more especially if seated on a riverthe
more obvious opportunities for picturesqueness and at Auxerre the
narrow streets rising from the quay to the central group of buildings
contribute many isolated effectscarved door steep gable or opportune
angleturretto the general distinction of the scene

The cathedral itself is the heart of the charming old placeso rich in
tone so impressive in outline so profusely yet delicately adorned
it rose at the end of the long marketsquare shedding on it even
through the grey sheets of rain the warmth of its high tawny masses
The design of the western front is so full and harmonious that it
effaces from memory the less salient impression of the interior Under
a more favourable light which would have brought out the colours of
the rich clerestory glass and the modelling of shafts and vaulting it
would have seemed no doubt less austere more familiarly beautiful
but veiled and darkened by rainclouds it offered instead of colour
and detail only an unfolding of cavernous arches fading into the deep
shades of the sanctuary

The adjoining Bishops palace with its rugged Romanesque arcades
planted on a bit of GalloRoman city wall and the interesting fragment
of the church of Saint Germain beside the hospital are among the
other notable monuments of Auxerre but these too masked by the
incessant downpour remained in memory as mere vague masses of dripping
masonry pressed upon by a low black sky

The rain pursued us northward from Auxerre along the valley of the
Yonne lifting a little toward noon to leave the landscape under
that greygreen blur through which the French paysagistes have most
persistently seen it Joigny with this light at its softest seemed
even after Auxerre one of the most individual of ancient French
towns its long and stately quay closed by a fine gate at each end of
the town giving it in especial a quite personal character and one
which presented itself as a singularly happy solution of the problem
of linking a town to its river Above the quay the steep streets gave
many glimpses of medival picturesqueness tucked away at almost
inaccessible angles but the rain closed in on them and drove us on
reluctantly to Sens

Here the deluge hung a still denser curtain between us and the
amenities of this singularly charming town Sens instead of being
like Joigny packed tight between river and cliff spreads out with
relative amplitude between Roman ramparts transformed into shady
promenades and about midway of the town at the end of a long
marketplace like that of Auxerre the cathedral rears itself in
such nobility and strength of line that one instantly revises ones
classification of the great French churches to make room for this one
near the top

Its beauties develop and multiply on a nearer view and its kinship
with Canterbury makes it to those under the spell of that noblest of
English choirs of peculiar architectural interest But when one has
done full justice to the long unfolding of the nave to the delicate
pallour of Cousins glass and to the associations attached to the
altar of Becket behind the choir one returns finally to the external
composition of the apsidal chapels as the most memorable and perfect
thing at Sens The development of the chevet which Romanesque
architecture bequeathed to Gothic is perhaps the happiest product of
the latter growth on French soil and after studying so complex an
example of its possibilities as the apse of Sens presents one feels
anew what English Gothic lost in committing itself to the square east
end

Illustration SENS APSE OF THE CATHEDRAL

Of great historic interest is the socalled Officialit which
adjoins the cathedrala kind of diocesan tribunal built under Louis
IX but its pointed windows and floriated niches have been so
liberally restored that it has the too Gothic look of a medival
stagesetting Sens has many other treasures not only in its unusually
rich collection of church relics and tapestries but among the
fragments of architecture distributed through its streets and in the
eighteenth century gates of the archiepiscopal palace it can show a
specimen of wroughtiron work probably not to be matched short of Jean
Lamours gates at Nancy

One of its most coveted possessionsJean Cousins famous picture of
the Eva prima Pandorahas long been jealously secluded by its
present owner and one wonders for what motive the inveterate French
hospitality to lovers of art has been here so churlishly reversed The
curious mystical interest of the work and its value as a link in the
history of French painting make it one may say almost a monument
historique a part of the national heritage and perhaps the very
sense of its potential service to art gives a perverse savour to its
possessors peculiar mode of enjoying it

From Sens to Fontainebleau the road follows the valley of the Yonne
through a tranquil landscape with level meadows and knots of slender
trees along the river till the border of the forest is reached and a
long green alley takes one straight to the granite cross on the edge of
the town Toward afternoon the rain turned to a quiet drizzle of the
kind that becomes the soft French landscape as a glass becomes certain
pictures and through it we glided on past the mossy walls of great
estates past lowlying chteaux green pices deau mid the long
grassy vistas that are cut in every direction through the forests about
Melun This district of big shootings and carefully tended preserves
extends almost to the outer ring of environs Beyond them Paris itself
soon rose smokily through the rain and a succession of long straight
avenues as carefully planted as if they had been the main arteries of
a fashionable suburb led us thence to the Porte de Choisy

To be back in the roar of traffic to feel the terrific pressure of
those miles of converging masonry gave us after weeks of free air
and unbounded landscape a sense of congestion that made the crowded
streets seem lowering and dangerous but as we neared the river and
saw before us the curves of the lifted domes the grey strength of the
bridges and all the amazing symmetry and elegance of what in other
cities is mean and huddled and confused the touch of another beauty
fell on usthe spell of les seuils sacrs la Seine qui coule




PART III

A FLIGHT TO THE NORTHEAST


There are several ways of leaving Paris by motor without touching even
the fringe of what were it like other cities would be called its
slums Going for instance southward or southwestward one may emerge
from the alleys of the Bois near the Pont de Suresnes and crossing the
river pass through the park of Saint Cloud to Versailles or through
the suburbs of Rueil and Le Vsinet to the forest of Saint Germain

These miraculous escapes from the toils of a great city give one a
dearer impression of the breadth with which it is planned and of the
civic order and elegance pervading its whole system yet for that very
reason there is perhaps more interest in a slow progress through one
of the great industrial quarters such as must be crossed to reach the
country lying to the northeast of Paris

To start on a bright spring morning from the Place du Palais
Bourbon and follow the tide of traffic along the quays of the left
bank passing the splendid masses of the Louvre and Notre Dame
the Conciergerie and the Sainte Chapelle to skirt the blossoming
borders of the Jardin des Plantes and cross the Seine at the Pont
dAusterlitz getting a long glimpse down its silver reaches till they
divide to envelope the Cit and then to enter by the Boulevard Diderot
on the long stretch of the Avenue Daumesnil which leads straight to
the Porte Dore of Vincennesto follow this route at the leisurely
pace necessitated by the dense flow of traffic is to get a memorable
idea of the large way in which Paris deals with some of her municipal
problems

The Avenue Daumesnil in particular with its interminable warehouses
and cheap shops and guinguettes would anywhere else be the prey of
grime and sordidness Instead it is spacious clean and prosaic only
by contrast to the elegance of the thoroughfares preceding it and at
the Porte Dore it gives one over to the charming alleys of a park
as welltended and far more beautiful than the Bois de Boulognea
park offering the luxury of its romantic lawns and lakes for the sole
delectation of the packed industrial quarters that surround it

The woods of this wonderful Bois de Vincennes are real woods full of
bluebells and lilies of the valley and as one flies through them
in the freshness of the May morning Paris seems already far behind
a mere fading streak of factorysmoke on the horizon One loses all
thought of it when beyond Vincennes the road crosses the Marne at
JoinvillesurPont Thence it passes through a succession of bright
semisuburban villages with glimpses here and there of low white
chteaux or of little grey churches behind rows of clipped hornbeam
climbing at length into an open hilly country through which it follows
the windings of the Marne to Meaux

Bossuets diocesan seat is a town of somewhat dull exterior with
a Gothic cathedral which has suffered cruelly at the hands of the
reformers for by an odd turn of fate before becoming the eyrie
of the Eagle it was one of the principal centres of Huguenot
activityan activity deplorably commemorated in the ravaged exterior
of the church

From Meaux to Rheims the country grows in charm with a slightly
English quality in its rolling spaces and rounded clumps of trees
but nothing could be more unEnglish than the greywhite villages
than the stony squares bordered by clipped hornbeams the granite
marketcrosses the roundapsed churches with their pointed belltowers

One of these villages Braisne stands out in memory by virtue of its
very unusual church This tall narrow structure with its curious
western front so oddly buttressed and tapering and rising alone and
fragmentary among the orchards and kitchengardens of a silent shrunken
hamlet is the pathetic survival of a powerful abbey once dominating
its surroundings but now existing only as the parish church of the
knot of sleepy houses about it

A stranger and less explicable vestige of the past is found not far
off in the curious walled village of Bazoches which though lying in
the plain must have been a small feudal domain since it still shows
its stout medival defences and halffallen gatetowers tufted with
wallflowers and wild shrubs The distinguishing fact about Bazoches is
that it is not a dwindled town with desert spaces between the walls
and a surviving nucleus of houses its girdle of stone fits as closely
as a fingerring and whatever were its past glories they must have
been contained in the same small compass that suffices it today

Beyond Braisne the country is less hilly the pastures are replaced by
vineyards and the road runs across a wide plain to Rheims The extent
of the town and its modern manufacturing outskirts make its distant
silhouette less characteristic than that of Bourges or Chartres which
are still so subordinated to the central mass of their cathedrals At
Rheims the cathedral comes on one unexpectedly in the centre of the
town but once seen it enters into the imagination less startlingly
but perhaps more completely more pervasively than any other of the
great Gothic monuments of France This sense of being possessed by
it subdued to it is perhaps partly dueat least in the case of the
simple touristto the happy the unparalleled fact that the inn at
Rheims stands immediately opposite the cathedralso that admitted at
once to full communion with its incomparable west front one returns
after each excursion to renew and deepen the relation to become
reabsorbed in it without any conscious effort of attention

There are two ways of feeling those artssuch as sculpture painting
and architecturewhich appeal first to the eye the technical and
what must perhaps be called the sentimental way The specialist does
not recognise the validity of the latter criterion and derision is
always busy with the uncritical judgments of those who have ventured
to interpret in terms of another art the great plastic achievements
The man in short who measures the beauty of a cathedral not by its
structural detail consciously analysed but by its total effect in
indirectly stimulating his sensations in setting up a movement of
associated ideas is classedand who shall say unjustlyas no better
than the reader who should pretend to rejoice in the music of Lycidas
without understanding the meaning of its words There is hardly a
way of controverting the axiom that thought and its formulation are
indivisible or the deduction that therefore the only critic capable
of appreciating the beauty of a great work of architecture is he who
can resolve it into its component parts understand the relation
they bear to each other and not only reconstruct them mentally but
conceive of them in a different relation and visualise the total
result of such modifications

Assuredlyyet in those arts that lie between the bounds of thought and
sense and leaning distinctly toward the latter is there not room for
another a lesser yet legitimate order of appreciationfor the kind of
confused atavistic enjoyment that is made up of historical association
of a sense of mass and harmony of the relation of the building to the
sky above it to the lights and shadows it creates about itdeeper
than all of a blind sense in the blood of its old racial power the
things it meant to faroff minds of which ours are the oftdissolved
and reconstituted fragments Such enjoyment to be of any value even
to the mind that feels it must be based indeed on an approximate
acquaintance with the conditions producing the building the structural
theories that led up to it their meaning their evolution their
relation to the moral and mental growth of the buildersindeed it
may be affirmed that this amount of familiarity with the past is
necessary to any genuine sthetic enjoyment But even this leaves the
enjoyment under the slur of being merely amateurish and therefore
in need of a somewhat courageous defence by those who unequipped for
technical verdicts have yet found a more than transient satisfaction
in impressions of this mixed and nebulous order

Such a defence is furnished to a degree elsewhere unmatched by the
exceptional closeness of intercourse to which propinquity admits the
traveller at Rheims Here is the great Presence on ones thresholdin
ones window surprised at dawn in the mystery of its rebirth
from darkness contemplated at midday in the distinctness of its
accumulated detail its complex ritual of stone absorbed into the
mind into the heart again at darknessfelt lastly and most deeply
under the midnight sky as a mystery of harmony and order no less
secret and majestic than the curves of the stars in their orbits

Such pleasures at any rate whatever their value as contributions
to special lines of knowledge enrich the sthetic consciousness
prepare it for fresh and perhaps more definite impressions enlarge
its sense of the underlying relation between art and life between all
the manifold and contradictory expressions of human energy and leave
it thus more prepared to defend its own attitude to see how in one
sensea sense not excluding but in a way enveloping and fertilising
all the specialised forms of technical competenceGefhl ist alles

                                   

It is one of the wonders of this rich northeastern district that
the traveller may pass in a few hours and through a region full
of minor interest to another great manifestation of medival
strength the fortress of Coucy Two such contrasting specimens of the
vigourindividual and collectiveof that tremendous age are hardly
elsewhere in France to be found in such close neighbourhood and it
adds to the interest of both to know that Coucy was a fief of Rheims
bestowed by its Archbishop on a knight who had distinguished himself
in the First Crusade It was a greatgrandson of this Enguerrand de
Boves who built the central keep and the walls but the castle was
farther enlarged and adorned when at the beginning of the fifteenth
century it passed into the possession of Louis dOrlans the brother
of Charles VI

It is doubly interesting to see Coucy after Carcassonne because
the two fortresses present the opposite extremes of feudal secular
architecture Carcassonne being the chief surviving example of a
large walled town with a comparatively small central castle while
at Coucy the castle is the predominating feature both in size and
site and the town no more than a handful of houses within the outer
circuit of its defences Both strongholds are of course situated on
steep heights and that of Coucy though it rises from slopes clad in
foliage and therefore less stern of outline than the dry southern rock
of Carcassonne stands no less superbly than its rival In fact there
is perhaps no single point from which Carcassonne produces quite such
an effect of concentrated power as the keep and castletowers of Coucy
squaring themselves on their western ridge Yet such comparisons are
unprofitable because the two fortresses were designed for purposes
so different and under such different conditions that the one is
necessarily most vigorous where the other had the least need for a
display of strength

Coucy in its present fallen state gains incalculably from the charm
of its surroundingsthe lovely country enfolding it in woods and
streams the shaded walks beneath its ivyhung ramparts and above all
the distinct and exquisite physiognomy of the tiny old town which these
ramparts enclose The contrast between the humble yet stout old stone
houses ranged as it were below the salt and the castle throned on
its dais of rock at one end of the enclosure seems to sum up the whole
social system of the Middle Ages as luminously and concisely as Taines
famous category Coucy has the extraordinary archological value of a
place that has never outgrown the special institutions producing it
the hands of the clock have stopped at the most characteristic moment
of its existence and so impressive even to the unhistorical mind is
its compact and vivid exteriorisation of a great phase of history
that one wonders and shudders at and finally almost comes to admire
the superhuman stolidity of the successful merchant who has planted
on the same ledge as the castle and almost parallel with its Titanic
towers a neatly turreted suburban villa the sole attempt of modern
Coucy to give the retort to its overwhelming past

                                   

Taking Coucy as a centre the traveller may within a few hours
extraordinarily vary his impressions since the remarkable group of
monuments distributed over the triangular bit of France between Paris
Rheims and Saint Quentin comprises a characteristic example of almost
every architectural period from the early Middle Ages till the close of
the eighteenth centurythe extremes being sometimes in as close touch
as TracyleVal and Prmontr

Turning first to the west through a country of rolling fields and
wooded heights vaguely English in its freedom from the devouring
agriculture of the centre one comes on the most English impression
in Francethe towers of Noyon rising above a girdle of orchards and
meadows Noyon indeed to the end maintains in one this illusionso
softly misted with verdure so lacking in the sharp edges of the
dry stony French town it seems by its old streetarchitecture
of crossbeams and stucco by the smoothly turfed setting of the
cathedral and the crowning surprise of a genuine close at its back
to corroborate at every step the explorers first impression

In the cathedral indeed one is no longer in Englandthough still
without being very definitely in France For the interior of Noyon
built at a time when northern art was still groping for its specific
expression is a thing apart in cathedral architecture one of those
fortunate variations from which in the world of art as of nature new
forms are sometimes developed That in this case the variation remained
sterile while it makes no doubt for a more exclusive enjoyment of
Noyon leaves one conjecturing on the failure to transmit itself of
so original and successful an experiment The deviation consists
principally in the fact that the transept ends of Noyon are rounded
so that they form in conjunction with the choir a kind of apsidal
trefoil of the most studied and consummate grace The instinctive use
of the word grace perhaps explains as well as anything the failure
of Noyon to repeat itself save once halfheartedly in the south
transept of Soissons Grace at the expense of strength is especially
from without the total result of this unique blending of curves
this prodigal repetition of an effect that to produce its deepest
impression should be used singly and only as the culmination the
ecstatic flowering of a vigorous assemblage of straight lines

But within the church and especially from the point where the
sweep of both transepts may be seen flowing into the curves of the
choir one is too deeply penetrated by the grace to feel in it any
latent weakness For pure loveliness of line nothing in northern
church architecturenot even the long bold sweep of Canterbury
choirsurpasses the complex pattern of the east end of Noyon And in
the detail of the interior construction the free almost careless
mingling of the round and the pointed arch heightens the effect of
Noyon as of something experimental fugitive not to come againthe
blue flower as it were of the Gothic gardenan experiment which
seems to express the fantasy of a single mind rather than such
collective endeavour as brought forth the great secular churches of the
Middle Ages

While Noyon offers in its general setting and in certain
architectural peculiarities suggestions so specifically English the
type of its chief civic monument seems drawn from that Burgundian
region where the passing of Gothic into Renaissance forms found so
rich and picturesque an expression The Htel de Ville of Noyon built
in the middle of the fifteenth century is a charming product of that
transitional moment which was at its best in the treatment of municipal
buildings since domestic architecture was still cramped and driven
to an overcrowding of detail by the lingering habit of semidefensive
construction In the creation of the townhall the new art could throw
off feudal restraints and the architect of the graceful ornate yet
sober building at Noyonwith its two faades so equally composed as
wholes so lingered over and caressed in every parthas united all the
freedom of the new spirit with the patient care for detail that marked
the old

At Saint Quentin not far to the northwest of Noyon a townhall of
more imposing dimensions suggests other architectural affinities This
part of France is close to the Low Countries and Flemish influences
have overflowed the borders The late Gothic Htel de Ville at Saint
Quentin with its elaborately composed faade surmounted by three
pointed gables was completed at a period when in other parts of
France Renaissance forms were rapidly superseding the earlier style
But here the Gothic lingers as it did in the Low Countries in a rich
yet sober and sturdy form of civic architecture which suits the moist
grey skies the flat fields the absence of any abrupt or delicate
lines in the landscape Saint Quentin a large dull manufacturing town
with a nucleus of picturesque buildings grouped about its townhall and
its deplorably renovated collegiate church has a tone so distinctively
northern and provincial that its other distinguishing possessionthe
collection of portraits by the great pastelliste Latourseems almost
as much expatriated as though it were actually beyond the frontier It
is difficult to conceive of the most expert interpreter of the Parisian
face as forming his style on physiognomies observed in the sleepy
streets and along the sluggish canals of Saint Quentin and the return
of his pictures to his birthplace if it has a certain historical
fitness somehow suggests a violent psychological dislocation and
makes one regard the vivid countenances lining the walls of the Muse
Lcuyer as those of migrs yearning to be back across the border
For Latour worked in the Attic age when the least remoteness from Paris
was exile and one may reasonably fancy the unmistakable likeness
between all his sitters to be the result of the strong centralising
pressure which left the French face no choice between Parisianism and
barbarism

Ones first impression on entering this singular portrait gallery
is of coming into a salon where all the habitus have taken the
same tone where the angles of difference have been so rubbed down
that personalities are as hard to differentiate as in a group of
Orientals The connecting link which unites a company ranging from
Vernezobre the colourdealer to Madame la Dauphine from the buffoon
Manelli to the Academician Duclosthis unifying trait is found in
the fixed smile on the lips of all the sitters It is curious
and a little disconcerting on first entering to see faces of such
marked individualityfrom the rough unshorn Vernezobre to the mincing
Camargooverrun by the same simper of good companyso disconcerting
that only by eliminating the universal Cupidsbow mouth and trying to
see the other features without it can one do justice to the vigorous
and penetrating portraiture of Latour Then indeed the pictures affirm
themselves as documents and the artists technical skill in varying
his methods with the type of his sitters becomes only less interesting
than the psychological insight of which after all it is a partial
expression Ones attention is at first absorbed by the high personal
interest of the portraits but when this has been allowed for the
general conclusion resulting from their collective study is that
even in that day of feminine ascendancy the mans face not only
plastically but psychologically was a far finer subject than the
womans Latour had before his easel some of the most distinguished
examples of both and how the men triumph and stand out how Rousseau
and dAlembert Maurice de Saxe and the matchless Vernezobre
overshadow and efface all the Camargos and Dauphinesses the Favarts
and Pompadours of the varied feminine assortment Only one little
ghostly nameless creaturea model a dancer the catalogue uncertainly

with quivering wings on the sharp pencil of the portraitist One

The short run from Saint Quentin to Laon carries one through charming
scenery from the Low Countries into a region distinctively French
but with such a touch of romance as Turner saw in the sober French
landscape when he did his Rivers and Harbours Laon the great
cathedral town of the northeast is not seated on a river but
the ridge that carries it rises so abruptly from the plain and so
simulates the enclosing curves of a bay that as we approached it the
silvery light on the spring fields at its base seemed like the shimmer
of water

Seen from the road to Saint Quentin Laon is one of the stateliest
hilltowns of Franceindeed it suggests rivalry with the highperched
Umbrian cities rather than with any nearer neighbours At one extremity
of the strangely hooked cliff the two ends of which bend toward each
other like a thumb and forefinger stands the ruined abbey church
of Saint Vincent now a part of the arsenal at the other rises the
citadel behind which are grouped the cathedral and episcopal palace
and the apex of the triangle between these pronged extremities is
occupied by the church of Saint Martin which lifts its Romanesque
towers above the remains of a Premonstratensian abbey In the sheltered
hollow enclosed between the thumb and forefinger lies the Cuve de
Saint Vincent a garden district of extraordinary fertility and
beyond it the interminable plain flows away toward the Belgian frontier

To the advantage of this site Laon adds the possession of
wellpreserved ramparts of two or three fortified gates to which
clusters of old houses have ingeniously attached themselves and above
all of its seventowered cathedrala cathedral now no longer though
its apse still adjoins an ancient group of diocesan buildings from the
cloistered court of which one obtains the finest impression of the
lateral mass of the monument

Notre Dame of Laon ranks in size among the secondary French
cathedrals but both in composition and in detail it occupies a place
in architecture as distinctive as its natural setting and perhaps no
higher praise can be awarded it than to say that like the church of
Vzelay it is worthy of the site it occupies

Illustration LAON GENERAL VIEW OF THE TOWN AND CATHEDRAL

The seven towers of Laon are its most notable ornament no other
cathedral roof of France bears such a glorious crown Four only of
the towers have received their upper tiers of arcades but the others
rise high enough above the roofridge to break its outline with
their massive buttresses and pyramidal capping The taller four are
distinguished by the originality of their upper stories of which
the intermediate one is octagonal and broken up into four groups
of arches of extreme lightness and vigour separated by stilted
roundarched openings which are carried through to the upper tier of
the tower At the west end of the church the open niches formed by the
octagonal sally of the towerarcades are filled by colossal stone oxen
modelled with a bold realism and advancing from their highperched
stalls almost as triumphantly as the brazen horses above the door of
Saint Marks

These effigies are supposed to commemorate the services of the patient
beasts who dragged the stone for the cathedral up the cruel hill of
Laon and looking up at their silhouettes projected ponderously
against the blue one is inclined to see in them a symbol of medival
churchbuildingof the moral and material cost at which Christianity
reared its monuments

The oxen of Laon and the angels of Saint Pre sous Vzelay might
indeed be said to stand for the two chief factors in this unparalleled
outburst of religious activitythe visionary passion that aroused
it and the painful expenditure of human and animal labour that made
the vision a reality When one reads of the rapidity with which many
of these prodigious works were executed of the fever of devotion
that flamed in whole communities one has under the gladness and
exaltation glimpses of a drudgery as unceasing and inconceivable as
that of the pyramidbuilders and out of which perhaps have grown the
more vigorous the stabler fibres of European characterand one feels
that the triumphing oxen of Laon though they stand for so vast a sum
of dull unrewarded unintelligible toil have on the whole done more
for civilisation than the angels of Saint Pre

                                   

At Soissons an old city saturated with Roman and Merovingian memories
Gothic art again triumphs but in a different and a milder strain

The short run from Laon to Soissons through a gently undulating
landscape prepares one for these softer impressions The GalloRoman
city has neither the proud site nor the defensive outline of Laon It
lies in the valley of the Aisne in a circle of wooded hills with
the river winding peaceably between the old town and its faubourg of
Saint Vaast Passing through this faubourg and crossing the Aisne
one is caught in a maze of narrow streets which lead up tortuously
to the cathedral square The pressure of surrounding houses makes it
difficult to get a comprehensive view of the church but one receives
in narrow glimpses through the clipped limes of the marketplace a
general impression of grace and sobriety that somehow precludes any
strong individual effect The cathedral of Soissons is indeed chiefly
remarkable for its repetition of the rounded transepts of Noyon though
in this case for reasons which it would be interesting to learn the
round end while receiving the farther development of an aisle and
triforium has been applied only to one transept

The thought of Soissons however at least in the mind of the passing
impressionist must remain chiefly associated with that rarest creation
of the late Gothic of the northeast the faade of Saint Jean des
Vignes This church which formed part of a monastic settlement in the
outskirts of the town is now almost in ruins and of the abbatial
buildings around it there remain only two admirable fragments of the
cloister arcade and the abbots house built at a much later date
So complete is the outline of the beautiful west front that one would
hardly guess the ruin of the nave but for the blue sky showing through
the vast circle of the central rose from which every fragment of
tracery has been stripped Yet one can pardon even that inhumanity
to the destroyers who respected the towersthose incomparable
towers so harmonious in their divergences so typical of that lost
secret of medival artthe preservation of symmetry in unlikeness
These western towers of Saint Jean rising strongly on each side of
the central door and reinforcing the airy elegance of the faade
by their vigorous vertical buttressing break at the level of the
upper gable into pyramidal masses of differing height and breadth
one more boldly tapering the other more massive and complex yet
preserving in a few essential featuresthe placing of the openings
the correspondence of strong horizontal linesa unity that dominates
their differences and binds them into harmony with the whole faade It
is sad on passing through the gaping western doorway to find ones
self on a bit of waste ground strewn with fragments of sculpture and
masonrysadder still to have the desolation emphasized by coming here
on a bit of Gothic cloister there on a still more distinctive specimen
of Renaissance arcading The quality of these surviving fragments
indicates how great must have been the interest both sthetic and
historical of this beautiful ruin and revives the vain wish that
in some remote corner of Europe invasion and civil war might have
spared at least one complete example of a great monastic colony
enabling one to visualise the humaner side of that medival life which
Carcassonne evokes in its militant aspect

Illustration SOISSONS RUINED CHURCH OF SAINTJEANDESVIGNES

                                   

The return from Soissons to Paris holds out so many delightful
alternatives in respect both of scenery and architecture that in
April especially the traveller may be excused for wavering between
Compigne and Senlis between Beauvais and Saint Leu dEsserent
Perhaps the road which traverses Senlis and Saint Leu just because it
offers less exceptional impressions brings one closer to the heart of
old France to its inexhaustible store of sober and familiar beauty
Senlis for instance is only a small sleepy town with two or three
churches of minor interestwith that the guidebook might dismiss it
but had there been anything in all our wanderings quite comparable to
the impression produced by that little cathedral in its quiet squarea
monument so compact yet noble so embroidered with delicate detail
above all so sunnedover with a wonderful golden lichen that it seems
like a dim old jewelcasket from which the gilding is almost worn

The other churches of Senlis enclosed like the cathedral in the
circuit of halfruined walls that make a miniature cit of the inner
town have something of the exquisite quality of its central monument
Both as it happens have been secularised and Saint Pierre the
later and more ornate of the two buildings has suffered the irony
of being converted into a market while Saint Frambourg an ancient
collegiate church has sunk to the uses of a storage warehouse In each
case access to the interior is sometimes hard to obtain but the two
faades one so delicate in its early Gothic reticence the other so
prodigal of the last graces of the style carry on almost unbrokenly
the architectural chronicle which begins with the Romanesque cathedral
and the neglect so painful to witness in the interior has given them
a surfacetone almost rich enough to atone for the cost at which it has
been acquired

                                   

If on leaving Senlis one turns westward skirting the wooded glades
of Chantilly and crossing the park at the foot of the Canal de la
Manche one comes presently into the valley of the Oise and a few
kilomtres farther on the village of Saint Leu dEsserent lifts its
terraced church above the river

The site of Saint Leu is that of the little peaked Mediterranean
towns there is something defensive defiant in the way it grasps its
hillside and lifts its church up like a shield The town owes this
crowning ornamentand doubtless also its own slender existenceto
the founding here in the eleventh century of a great Cluniac abbey
of which certain Romanesque arcades and a fortified gate may be
traced among the dbris behind the apse Of the original church there
survives only a roundarched tower to which in the latter half of the
twelfth century was added what is perhaps the most homogeneous and
assuredly the most beautiful early Gothic structure in France The
peculiar interest of this church of Saint Leuapart from its intrinsic
nobility of designlies in the fact of its being so curiously the
counterpart the other side of the shield of the church of Vzelay
For as at Vzelay one felt beneath the weight of the round openings
the impatient stirrings of the pointed arch so here at Saint Leu
where the latter form at last triumphs its soaring movement is still
held down by the closeknit Romanesque frame of the church It is hard
to define the cause of this impression since at Saint Leu the pointed
style has quite freed itself structurally from Romanesque entraves
all the chief elements of later Gothic construction being blent there
in so harmonious a composition that as Mr Charles Moore has pointed
out the church might stand for a perfect example of unadorned
Gothic All that later art could do toward the elaboration of such a
style was to add ornament enlarge openings and lighten the masses
But by the doing of just that the immense static value of the earlier
proportions was lostand the distinction of Saint Leu is that it
blends in perfect measure Gothic lightness with Romanesque tenacity

Of this the inside of the church is no less illustrative than its
exterior Though the western bays of the nave were built later than its
eastern portion they end in a narthex on the lines of the outer porch
of Vzelay surmounted by a gallery from which the great sweep of the
aisles and triforium may be felt in all its grandeur For despite
the moderate proportions of the church grandeur and reserve are its
dominating qualitieswithin and without it has attained the classic
balance that great art at all times has its own ways of reaching

                                   

Westward from Saint Leu the valley of the Oise fruitful but
somewhat shadeless winds on toward Paris through pleasant riverside
townsBeaumont lIsleAdam and the ancient city of Pontoise and
beyond the latter at a point where the river flings a large loop to
the west one may turn east again and crossing the forest of Saint
Germain descend on Paris through the long shadows of the park of Saint
Cloud
