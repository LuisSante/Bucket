THE OLD LADY SHOWS HER MEDALS


Three nice old ladies and a criminal who is even nicer are discussing
the war over a cup of tea The criminal who is the hostess calls it a
dish of tea which shows that she comes from Caledonia but that is not
her crime

They are all London charwomen but three of them including the hostess
are what are called professionally charwomen and or simply
ands An and is also a caretaker when required her name is entered
as such in ink in a registry book financial transactions take place
across a counter between her and the registrar and altogether she is of
a very different social status from one who like Mrs Haggerty is a
charwoman but nothing else Mrs Haggerty though present is not at the
party by invitation having seen Mrs Dowey buying the winkles she
followed her downstairs so has shuffled into the play and sat down in
it against our wish We would remove her by force or at least print her
name in small letters were it not that she takes offence very readily
and says that nobody respects her So as you have slipped in you sit
there Mrs Haggerty but keep quiet

There is nothing doing at present in the caretaking way for Mrs Dowey
our hostess but this does not damp her caretaking being only to such
as she an extra financially and a halo socially If she had the honour
of being served with an incometax paper she would probably fill in one
of the nasty little compartments with the words Tradecharring
Profession if anycaretaking This home of hers from which to look
after your house she makes occasionally temporary departures in great
style escorting a barrow is in one of those whatcareI streets that
you discover only when you have lost your way on discovering them your
duty is to report them to the authorities who immediately add them to
the map of London That is why we are now reporting Friday Street We
shall call it in the rough sketch drawn for tomorrows press Street
in which the criminal resided and you will find Mrs Doweys home
therein marked with a X

Her abode really consists of one room but she maintains that there are
two so rather than argue let us say that there are two The other one
has no window and she could not swish her old skirts in it without
knocking something over its grandest display is of tin pans and
crockery on top of a dresser which has a lid to it you have but to whip
off the utensils and raise the lid and behold a bath with hot and
cold Mrs Dowey is very proud of this possession and when she shows it
off as she does perhaps too frequently she first signs to you with
closed fist funny old thing that she is to approach softly She then
tiptoes to the dresser and pops off the lid as if to take the bath
unawares Then she sucks her lips and is modest if you have the grace
to do the exclamations

In the real room is a bed though that is putting the matter too
briefly The fair way to begin if you love Mrs Dowey is to say to her
that it is a pity she has no bed If she is in her best form she will
chuckle and agree that the want of a bed tries her sore she will keep
you on the hooks so to speak as long as she can and then with that
mouselike movement again she will suddenly spring the bed on you You
thought it was a wardrobe but she brings it down from the wall and lo
a bed There is nothing else in her abode which we now see to contain
four roomskitchen pantry bedroom and bathroom that is absolutely
a surprise but it is full of bits every one of which has been paid
ready money for and gloated over and tended until it has become part of
its owner Genuine Doweys the dealers might call them though there is
probably nothing in the place except the bed that would fetch
halfacrown

Her home is in the basement so that the view is restricted to the lower
half of persons passing overhead beyond the area stairs Here at the
window Mrs Dowey sometimes sits of a summer evening gazing not
sentimentally at a flowerpot which contains one poor bulb nor
yearningly at some tiny speck of sky but with unholy relish at holes in
stockings and the like which are revealed to her from her point of
vantage You gentle reader may flaunt by thinking that your finery
awes the street but Mrs Dowey can tell and does that your soles are
in need of neat repair

Also lower parts being as expressive as the face to those whose view is
thus limited she could swear to scores of the passersby in a court of
law

These four lively old codgers are having a good time at the teatable
and wit is flowing free As you can see by their everyday garments and
by their pails and mops which are having a little teaparty by
themselves in the corner it is not a gathering by invitations
stretching away into yesterday it is a purely informal affair so much
more attractive dont you think than banquets elaborately prearranged
You know how they come about especially in wartime Very likely Mrs
Dowey met Mrs Twymley and Mrs Mickleham quite casually in the street
and meant to do no more than the time of day then naturally enough
the word camouflage was mentioned and they got heated but in the end
Mrs Twymley apologised then in the odd way in which one thing leads
to another the winkle man appeared and Mrs Dowey remembered that she
had that pot of jam and that Mrs Mickleham had stood treat last time
and soon they were all three descending the area stairs followed
cringingly by the Haggerty Woman

They have been extremely merry and never were four hardworked old
ladies who deserved it better All a woman can do in wartime they do
daily and cheerfully Just as their menfolk are doing it at the Front
and now with the mops and pails laid aside they sprawl gracefully at
ease There is no intention on their part to consider peace terms until
a decisive victory has been gained in the field Sarah Ann Dowey until
the Kaiser is put to the rightabout Emma Mickleham and singing very
small Amelia Twymley

At this teaparty the lady who is to play the part of Mrs Dowey is sure
to want to suggest that our heroine has a secret sorrow namely the
crime but you should see us knocking that idea out of her head Mrs
Dowey knows she is a criminal but unlike the actress she does not
know that she is about to be found out and she is to put it bluntly in
her own Scotch way the merriest of the whole clanjamfry She presses
more tea on her guests but they wave her away from them in the pretty
manner of ladies who know that they have already had more than enough

MRS DOWEY Just one more winkle Mrs Mickleham Indeed there is only
one more

But Mrs Mickleham indicates politely that if she took this one it would
have to swim for it The Haggerty Woman takes it long afterwards when
she thinks erroneously that no one is looking

Mrs Twymley is sulking Evidently some one has contradicted her
Probably the Haggerty Woman

MRS TWYMLEY I say it is so

THE HAGGERTY WOMAN I say it may be so

MRS TWYMLEY I suppose I ought to know me that has a son a prisoner
in Germany She has so obviously scored that all good feeling seems to
call upon her to end here But she continues rather shabbily Being the
only lady present that has that proud misfortune The others are stung

MRS DOWEY My son is fighting in France

MRS MICKLEHAM Mine is wounded in two places

THE HAGGERTY WOMAN Mine is at Salonaiky

The absurd pronunciation of this uneducated person moves the others to
mirth

MRS DOWEY Youll excuse us Mrs Haggerty but the correct
pronunciation is Salonikky

THE HAGGERTY WOMAN to cover her confusion I dont think She feels
that even this does not prove her case And I speak as one that has War
Savings Certificates

MRS TWYMLEY We all have them

The Haggerty Woman whimpers and the other guests regard her with
unfeeling disdain

MRS DOWEY to restore cheerfulness Oh its a terrible war

ALL brightening It is You may say so

MRS DOWEY encouraged What I say is the men is splendid but Im
none so easy about the staff Thats your weak point Mrs Mickleham

MRS MICKLEHAM on the defence but determined to reveal nothing that
might be of use to the enemy You may take it from me the staffs all
right

MRS DOWEY And very relieved I am to hear you say it

It is here that the Haggerty Woman has the remaining winkle

MRS MICKLEHAM You dont understand properly about trench warfare If
I had a map

MRS DOWEY wetting her finger to draw lines on the table Thats the
river Sommy Now if we had barrages here

MRS TWYMLEY Very soon you would be enfilided Wheres your supports
my lady Mrs Dowey is damped

MRS MICKLEHAM What none of you grasps is that this is a artillery
war

THE HAGGERTY WOMAN strengthened by the winkle I say that the word is
Salonaiky

The others purse their lips

MRS TWYMLEY with terrible meaning Well change the subject Have you
seen this weeks Fashion Chat She has evidently seen and
devoured it herself and even licked up the crumbs The gabardine with
accordion pleats has quite gone out

MRS DOWEY her old face sparkling My sakes You tell me

MRS TWYMLEY with the touch of haughtiness that comes of great topics
The plain smock has come in again with silk lacing giving that
charming chic effect

MRS DOWEY Oho

MRS MICKLEHAM I must say I was always partial to the straight
linethoughtfully regarding the want of line in Mrs Twymleys
personthough trying to them as is of too friendly a figure

It is here that the Haggerty Womans fingers close unostentatiously upon
a piece of sugar

MRS TWYMLEY sailing into the Empyrean Lady Dolly Kanister was seen
conversing across the railings in a dainty de jou

MRS DOWEY Fine would I have liked to see her

MRS TWYMLEY She is equally popular as maid wife and
munitionworker Her two children is inset Lady Pops Babington was
married in a tight tulle

MRS MICKLEHAM What was her goingaway dress

MRS TWYMLEY A champagny cream velvet with dreamy corsage Shes
married to Colonel the Hon ChingfordSnubs they called him at
Eton

THE HAGGERTY WOMAN having disposed of the sugar Very likely hell be
sent to Salonaiky

MRS MICKLEHAM Wherever he is sent shell have the same tremors as
the rest of us Shell be as keen to get the letters wrote with pencils
as you or me

MRS TWYMLEY Them pencil letters

MRS DOWEY in her sweet Scotch voice timidly afraid she may be going
too far And women in enemy lands gets those pencil letters and then
stop getting them the same as ourselves Lets occasionally think of
that

She has gone too far Chairs are pushed back

THE HAGGERTY WOMAN I ask you

MRS MICKLEHAM Thats hardly language Mrs Dowey

MRS DOWEY scared Kindly excuse I swear to death Im none of your
pacifists

MRS MICKLEHAM Freely granted

MRS TWYMLEY Ive heard of females that have no male relations and so
they have no manparty at the wars Ive heard of them but I dont mix
with them

MRS MICKLEHAM What can the likes of us have to say to them Its not
their war

MRS DOWEY wistfully They are to be pitied

MRS MICKLEHAM But the place for them Mrs Dowey is within doors
with the blinds down

MRS DOWEY hurriedly Thats the place for them

MRS MICKLEHAM I saw one of them today buying a flag I thought it
was very impudent of her

MRS DOWEY meekly So it was

MRS MICKLEHAM trying to look modest with indifferent success I had
a letter from my son Percy yesterday

MRS TWYMLEY Alfred sent me his photo

THE HAGGERTY WOMAN Letters from Salonaiky is less common

Three bosoms heave but not alas Mrs Doweys Nevertheless she
doggedly knits her lips

MRS DOWEY the criminal Kenneth writes to me every week There are
exclamations The dauntless old thing holds aloft a packet of letters
Look at this All his

The Haggerty Woman whimpers

MRS TWYMLEY Alfred has little time for writing being a bombardier

MRS DOWEY relentlessly Do your letters begin Dear mother

MRS TWYMLEY Generally

MRS MICKLEHAM Invariable

THE HAGGERTY WOMAN Every time

MRS DOWEY delivering the knockout blow Kenneths begin Dearest
mother

No one can think of the right reply

MRS TWYMLEY doing her best A short man I should say judging by
yourself

She ought to have left it alone

MRS DOWEY Six feet twoand a half

The gloom deepens

MRS MICKLEHAM against her better judgment A kilty did you tell me

MRS DOWEY Most certainly Hes in the famous Black Watch

THE HAGGERTY WOMAN producing her handkerchief The Surrey Rifles is
the famousest

MRS MICKLEHAM There you and the King disagrees Mrs Haggerty His
choice is the Buffs same as my Percys

MRS TWYMLEY magnanimously Give me the RHA and you can keep all
the rest

MRS DOWEY Im sure I have nothing to say against the Surreys and the
RHA and the Buffs but they are just breeches regiments I
understand

THE HAGGERTY WOMAN We cant all be kilties

MRS DOWEY crushingly Thats very true

MRS TWYMLEY It is foolish of her but she cant help saying it Has
your Kenneth great hairy legs

MRS DOWEY Tremendous

The wicked woman but let us also say Poor Sarah Ann Dowey For at
this moment enter Nemesis In other words the less important part of
a clergyman appears upon the stair

MRS MICKLEHAM Its the reverent gent

MRS DOWEY little knowing what he is bringing her I see he has had
his boots heeled

It may be said of Mr Willings that his happy smile always walks in
front of him This smile makes music of his life it means that once
again he has been chosen in his opinion as the central figure in
romance No one can well have led a more drab existence but he will
never know it he will always think of himself humbly though elatedly
as the chosen of the gods Of him must it have been originally written
that adventures are for the adventurous He meets them at every street
corner For instance he assists an old lady off a bus and asks her if
he can be of any further help She tells him that she wants to know the
way to Maddox the butchers Then comes the kind triumphant smile it
always comes first followed by its explanation I was there
yesterday This is the merest sample of the adventures that keep Mr
Willings up to the mark

Since the war broke out his zest for life has become almost terrible
He can scarcely lift a newspaper and read of a hero without remembering
that he knows some one of the name The Soldiers Rest he is connected
with was once a china emporium and mark my words he had bought his
tea service at it Such is life when you are in the thick of it
Sometimes he feels that he is part of a gigantic spy drama In the
course of his extraordinary comings and goings he meets with Great
Personages of course and is the confidential recipient of secret news
Before imparting the news he does not as you might expect first smile
expansively on the contrary there comes over his face an awful
solemnity which however means the same thing When divulging the
names of the personages he first looks around to make sure that no
suspicious character is about and then lowering his voice tells you
I had that from Mr Farthing himselfhe is the secretary of the
Bethnal Green Branchhsh

There is a commotion about finding a worthy chair for the reverent and
there is also some furtive pulling down of sleeves but he stands
surveying the ladies through his triumphant smile This amazing man
knows that he is about to score again

MR WILLINGS waving aside the chairs I thank you But not at all
Friends I have news

MRS MICKLEHAM News

THE HAGGERTY WOMAN From the Front

MRS TWYMLEY My Alfred sir

They are all grown suddenly anxiousall except the hostess who knows
that there can never be any news from the Front for her

MR WILLINGS I tell you at once that all is well The news is for Mrs
Dowey

She stares

MRS DOWEY News for me

MR WILLINGS Your son Mrs Doweyhe has got five days leave She
shakes her head slightly or perhaps it only trembles a little on its
stem Now now good news doesnt kill

MRS TWYMLEY Were glad Mrs Dowey

MRS DOWEY Youre sure

MR WILLINGS Quite sure He has arrived

MRS DOWEY He is in London

MR WILLINGS He is I have spoken to him

MRS MICKLEHAM You lucky woman

They might see that she is not looking lucky but experience has told
them how differently these things take people

MR WILLINGS marvelling more and more as he unfolds his tale Ladies
it is quite a romance I was in the he looks around cautiously but
he knows that they are all to be trustedin the Church Army quarters
in Central Street trying to get on the track of one or two of our
missing men Suddenly my eyesI cant account for itbut suddenly my
eyes alighted on a Highlander seated rather drearily on a bench with
his kit at his feet

THE HAGGERTY WOMAN A big man

MR WILLINGS A great brawny fellow The Haggerty Woman groans My
friend I said at once welcome back to Blighty I make a point of
calling it Blighty I wonder I said if there is anything I can do
for you He shook his head What regiment I asked Here Mr
Willings very properly lowers his voice to a whisper Black Watch th
Battalion he said Name I asked Dowey he said

MRS MICKLEHAM I declare I do declare

MR WILLINGS showing how the thing was done with the help of a chair
I put my hand on his shoulder as it might be thus Kenneth Dowey I
said I know your mother

MRS DOWEY wetting her lips What did he say to that

MR WILLINGS He was incredulous Indeed he seemed to think I was
balmy But I offered to bring him straight to you I told him how much
you had talked to me about him

MRS DOWEY Bring him here

MRS MICKLEHAM I wonder he needed to be brought

MR WILLINGS He had just arrived and was bewildered by the great
city He listened to me in the taciturn Scotch way and then he gave
a curious laugh

MRS TWYMLEY Laugh

MR WILLINGS whose wild life has brought him into contact with the
strangest people The Scotch Mrs Twymley express their emotions
differently from us With them tears signify a rollicking mood while
merriment denotes that they are plunged in gloom When I had finished he
said at once Let us go and see the old lady

MRS DOWEY backing which is the first movement she has made since he
began his tale Is hecoming

MR WILLINGS gloriously He has come He is up there I told him I
thought I had better break the joyful news to you

Three women rush to the window Mrs Dowey looks at her pantry door but
perhaps she remembers that it does not lock on the inside She stands
rigid though her face has gone very grey

MRS DOWEY Kindly get them to go away

MR WILLINGS Ladies I think this happy occasion scarcely requires
you He is not the man to ask of woman a sacrifice that he is not
prepared to make himself I also am going instantly They all survey
Mrs Dowey and understandor think they understand

MRS TWYMLEY pail and mop in hand I would thank none for their
company if my Alfred was at the door

MRS MICKLEHAM similarly burdened The same from me Shall I send him
down Mrs Dowey The old lady does not hear her She is listening
terrified for a step on the stairs Look at the poor joyous thing
sir She has his letters in her hand

The three women go Mr Willings puts a kind hand on Mrs Doweys
shoulder He thinks he so thoroughly understands the situation

MR WILLINGS A good son Mrs Dowey to have written to you so often

Our old criminal quakes but she grips the letters more tightly Private
Dowey descends

Dowey my friend there she is waiting for you with your letters in
her hand

DOWEY grimly Thats great

Mr Willings ascends the stair without one backward glance like the
good gentleman he is and the Doweys are left together with nearly the
whole room between them He is a great rough chunk of Scotland howked
out of her not so much neatly as liberally and in his Black Watch
uniform all caked with mud his kit and nearly all his worldly
possessions on his back he is an apparition scarcely less fearsome but
so much less ragged than those ancestors of his who trotted with Prince
Charlie to Derby He stands silent scowling at the old lady daring her
to raise her head and she would like very much to do it for she longs
to have a first glimpse of her son When he does speak it is to jeer at
her

Do you recognise your loving son missis Oh the fine Scotch tang
of him she thinks Im pleased I wrote so often Oh but hes
raized she thinks He strides towards her and seizes the
letters roughly Lets see them

There is a string round the package and he unties it and examines the
letters at his leisure with much curiosity The envelopes are in order
all addressed in pencil to Mrs Dowey with the proud words Opened by
Censor on them But the letter paper inside contains not a word of
writing

Nothing but blank paper Is this your writing in pencil on the
envelope She nods and he gives the matter further consideration

The covey told me you were a charwoman so I suppose you picked the
envelopes out of wastepaper baskets or such like and then changed the
addresses She nods again still she dare not look up but she is
admiring his legs When however he would cast the letters into the
fire she flames up with sudden spirit She clutches them

Dont you burn them letters mister

Theyre not real letters

Theyre all I have

He returns to irony I thought you had a son

I never had a man nor a son nor anything I just call myself Missis to
give me a standing

Well its past my seeing through

He turns to look for some explanation from the walls She gets a peep at
him at last Oh what a grandly setup man Oh the stride of him Oh
the noble rage of him Oh Samson had been like this before that woman
took him in hand

He whirls round on her What made you do it

It was everybodys war mister except mine She beats her arms
I wanted it to be my war too

Youll need to be plainer And yet Im dd if I care to hear you
you lying old trickster

The words are merely what were to be expected and so are endurable but
he has moved towards the door

Youre not going already mister

Yes I just came to give you an ugly piece of my mind

She holds out her arms longingly You havent gave it to me yet

You have a cheek

She gives further proof of it You wouldnt drink some tea

Me I tell you I came here for the one purpose of blazing away at you

It is such a roaring negative that it blows her into a chair But she is
up again in a moment is this spirited old lady You could drink the
tea while you was blazing away Theres winkles

Is there He turns interestedly towards the table but his proud Scots
character checks him which is just as well for what she should have
said was that there had been winkles Not me Youre just a common
rogue He seats himself far from the table Now then out with it
Sit down She sits meekly there is nothing she would not do for him
As you char I suppose you are on your feet all day

Im more on my knees

Thats where you should be to me

Oh mister Im willing

Stop it Go on you accomplished liar

Its true that my name is Dowey

Its enough to make me change mine

Ive been charring and charring and charring as far back as I mind
Ive been in London this twenty years

Well skip your early days I have an appointment

And then when I was old the war broke out

How could it affect you

Oh mister thats the thing It didnt affect me It affected
everybody but me The neighbours looked down on me Even the posters on
the walls of the woman saying Go my boy leered at me I sometimes
cried by myself in the dark You wont have a cup of tea

No

Sudden like the idea came to me to pretend I had a son

You depraved old limmer But what in the name of Old Nick made you
choose me out of the whole British Army

Mrs Dowey giggles There is little doubt that in her youth she was an
accomplished flirt Maybe mister it was because I liked you best

Now now woman

I read one day in the papers In which he was assisted by Private K
Dowey th Battalion Black Watch

Private K Dowey is flattered Did you now Well I expect thats the
only time I was ever in the papers

Mrs Dowey tries it on again I didnt choose you for that alone I
read a history of the Black Watch first to make sure it was the best
regiment in the world

Anybody could have told you that He is moving about now in better
humour and meeting the loaf in his stride he cuts a slice from it He
is hardly aware of this but Mrs Dowey knows I like the Scotch voice
of you woman It drummles on like a hill burn

Prosen Water runs by where I was born Flirting again May be it
teached me to speak mister

Canny woman canny

I read about the Black Watchs ghostly piper that plays proudly when
the men of the Black Watch do well and prouder when they fall

Theres some foolish story of that kind He has another careless slice
off the loaf But you couldnt have been living here at that time or
they would have guessed I suppose you flitted

Yes it cost me eleven and sixpence

How did you guess the K in my name stood for Kenneth

Does it

Umpha

An angel whispered it to me in my sleep

Well thats the only angel in the whole black business He chuckles

You little thought I would turn up Wheeling suddenly on her Or did
you

I was beginning to weary for a sight of you Kenneth

What word was that

Mister

He helps himself to butter and she holds out the jam pot to him but he
haughtily rejects it Do you think she gives in now Not a bit of it

He returns to sarcasm I hope youre pleased with me now you see me

Im very pleased Does your folk live in Scotland

Glasgow

Both living

Ay

Is your mother terrible proud of you

Naturally

Youll be going to them

After Ive had a skite in London first

The old lady sniffs So she is in London

Who

Your young lady

Are you jealyous

Not me

You needna be Shes a young thing

You surprises me A beauty no doubt

You may be sure He tries the jam Shes a titled person She is
equally popular as maid wife and munitionworker

Mrs Dowey remembers Lady Dolly Kanister so familiar to readers of
fashionable gossip and a very leery expression indeed comes into her
face

Tell me more about her man

She has sent me a lot of things especially cakes and a worsted
waistcoat with a loving message on the enclosed card

The old lady is now in a quiver of excitement She loses control of
her arms which jump excitedly this way and that

Youll try one of my cakes mister

Not me

Theyre of my own making

No I thank you

But with a funny little run she is in the pantry and back again She
planks down a cake before him at sight of which he gapes

Whats the matter Tell me oh tell me mister

Thats exactly the kind of cake that her ladyship sends me

Mrs Dowey is now a very glorious old character indeed

Is the waistcoat right mister I hope the Black Watch colours pleased
you

What Was it you

I daredna give my own name you see and I was always reading hers in
the papers

The badgered man looms over her terrible for the last time

Woman is there no getting rid of you

Are you angry

He sits down with a groan

Oh hell Give me some tea

She rushes about preparing a meal for him every bit of her wanting
to cry out to every other bit Oh glory glory glory For a moment
she hovers behind his chair Kenneth she murmurs What he asks
no longer aware that she is taking a liberty Nothing she says
just Kenneth and is off gleefully for the teacaddy But when his
tea is poured out and he has drunk a saucerful the instinct of
selfpreservation returns to him between two bites

Dont you be thinking missis for one minute that you have got me

No no

On that understanding he unbends

I have a theatre tonight followed by a randydandy

Oho Kenneth this is a queer first meeting

It is woman oh it is guardedly and its also a last meeting

Yes yes

So heres to youyou old mop and pail Ave atque vale

Whats that

That means Hail and Farewell

Are you a scholar

Being Scotch theres almost nothing I dont know

What was you to trade

Carter glazier orraman any rough jobs

Youre a proper man to look at

Im generally admired

Shes an enviable woman

Who

Your mother

Eh Oh that was just protecting myself from you I have neither father
nor mother nor wife nor grandmama Bitterly This party never even
knew who his proud parents were

Is thatgleamingis that true

Its gospel

Heaven be praised

Eh None of that I was a fool to tell you But dont think you can
take advantage of it Pass the cake

I daresay its true well never meet again Kenneth butbut if we do
I wonder where it will be

Not in this world

Theres no tellingleering ingratiatinglyIt might be at Berlin

Tod if I ever get to Berlin I believe Ill find you there waiting
for me

With a cup of tea for you in my hand

Yes andheartilyvery good tea too

He has partaken heavily he is now in high good humour

Kenneth we could come back by Paris

All the ladies slapping his knees likes to go to Paris

Oh Kenneth Kenneth if just once before I die I could be fitted for
a Paris gown with dreamy corsage

Youre all alike old covey We have a song about it He sings

  Mrs Gill is very ill
     Nothing can improve her
   But to see the Tuileries
     And waddle through the Louvre

No song ever had a greater success Mrs Dowey is doubled up with mirth
When she comes to when they both come to for there are a pair of them
she cries

You must learn me that and off she goes in song also

  Mrs Doweys very ill
     Nothing can improve her


Stop cries clever Kenneth and finishes the verse

  But dressed up in a Paris gown
    To waddle through the Louvre


They fling back their heads she points at him he points at her She
says ecstatically

Hairy legs

A mad remark which brings him to his senses he remembers who and what
she is

Mind your manners Rising Well thank you for my tea I must be
stepping

Poor Mrs Dowey he is putting on his kit

Where are you living

He sighs

Thats the question But theres a place called The Hut where some of
the nd Battalion are Theyll take me in Beggars bitterly cant be
choosers

Beggars

Ive never been here before If you knewa shadow coming over
himwhat it is to be in such a place without a friend I was crazy
with glee when I got my leave at the thought of seeing London at last
but after wandering its streets for four hours I would almost have been
glad to be back in the trenches

If you knew he has said but indeed the old lady knows

Thats my quandorum too Kenneth

He nods sympathetically

Im sorry for you you poor old body shouldering his kit But I see
no way out for either of us

A cooing voice says Do you not

Are you at it again

She knows that it must be now or never She has left her biggest guns
for the end In her excitement she is rising up and down on her toes

Kenneth Ive heard that the thing a man on leave longs for more than
anything else is a bed with sheets and a bath

You never heard anything truer

Go into that pantry Kenneth Dowey and lift the dressertop and tell
me what you see

He goes There is an awful stillness He returns impressed

Its a kind of a bath

You could do yourself there pretty half at a time

Me

Theres a woman through the wall that would be very willing to give me
a shakedown till your leave is up

He snorts

Oh is there

She has not got him yet but there is still one more gun

Kenneth look

With these simple words she lets down the bed She says no more an
effect like this would be spoilt by language Fortunately he is not
made of stone He thrills

My word Thats the dodge we need in the trenches

Thats your bed Kenneth

Mine He grins at her You queer old divert What can make you so
keen to be burdened by a lump like me

He he he he

I tell you Im the commonest kind of man

Im just the commonest kind of old wifie myself

Ive been a kickabout all my life and Im no great shakes at the
war

Yes you are How many Germans have you killed

Just two for certain and there was no glory in it It was just because
they wanted my shirt

Your shirt

Well they said it was their shirt

Have you took prisoners

I once took half a dozen but that was a poor affair too

How could one man take half a dozen

Just in the usual way I surrounded them

Kenneth youre just my ideal

Youre easily pleased

He turns again to the bed Lets see how the thing works He kneads
the mattress with his fist and the result is so satisfactory that he
puts down his kit

Old lady if you really want me Ill bide

Oh oh oh oh

Her joy is so demonstrative that he has to drop a word of warning

But mind you I dont accept you as a relation For your personal
glory you can go on pretending to the neighbours but the best I can
say for you is that youre on your probation Im a cautious character
and we must see how youll turn out

Yes Kenneth

And now I think for that bath My theatre begins at sixthirty A
cove I met on a bus is going with me

She is a little alarmed

Youre sure youll come back

Yes yes handsomely I leave my kit in pledge

You wont liquor up too freely Kenneth

Youre the first chuckling to care whether I do or not Nothing
she has said has pleased the lonely man so much as this I promise
Tod Im beginning to look forward to being wakened in the morning by
hearing you cry Get up you lazy swine Ive kind of envied men that
had womenfolk with the right to say that

He is passing to the bathroom when a diverting notion strikes him

What is it Kenneth

The theatre It would be showier if I took a lady

Mrs Dowey feels a thumping at her breast

Kenneth tell me this instant what you mean Dont keep me on the
jumps

He turns her round

No It couldnt be done

Was it me you were thinking of

Just for the moment regretfully but you have no style

She catches hold of him by the sleeve

Not in this of course But oh Kenneth if you saw me in my merino
Its laced up the back in the very latest

Hum doubtfully but lets see it

It is produced from a drawer to which the old lady runs with almost
indecent haste The connoisseur examines it critically

Looks none so bad Have you a bit of chiffon for the neck Its not
bombs nor Kaisers nor Tipperary that men in the trenches think of its
chiffon

I swear I have Kenneth And I have a bangle and a muff and gloves

Ay ay He considers Do you think you could give your face less of
a homely look

Im sure I could

Then you can have a try But mind you I promise nothing All will
depend on the effect

He goes into the pantry and the old lady is left alone Not alone for
she is ringed round by entrancing hopes and dreadful fears They beam on
her and jeer at her they pull her this way and that with difficulty
she breaks through them and rushes to her pail hot water soap and
a lookingglass Our last glimpse of her for this evening shows her
staring not discontentedly at her soft old face licking her palm
and pressing it to her hair Her eyes are sparkling

                                   

One evening a few days later Mrs Twymley and Mrs Mickleham are in Mrs
Doweys house awaiting that ladys return from some fashionable
dissipation They have undoubtedly been discussing the war for the
first words we catch are

MRS MICKLEHAM I tell you flat Amelia I bows no knee to junkerdom

MRS TWYMLEY Sitting here by the fire you and me as one to another
what do you think will happen after the war Are we to go back to being
as we were

MRS MICKLEHAM Speaking for myself Amelia not me The war has
wakened me up to a understanding of my own importance that is really
astonishing

MRS TWYMLEY Same here Instead of being the poor worms the like of
you and me thought we was we turns out to be visible departments of
a great and haughty empire

They are well under weigh and with a little luck we might now hear
their views on various passing problems of the day such as the neglect
of science in our public schools But in comes the Haggerty Woman and
spoils everything She is attired like them in her best but the
effect of her is that her clothes have gone out for a walk leaving her
at home

MRS MICKLEHAM with deep distaste Heres that submarine again

The Haggerty Woman cringes to them but gets no encouragement

THE HAGGERTY WOMAN Its a terrible war

MRS TWYMLEY Is that so

THE HAGGERTY WOMAN I wonder what will happen when it ends

MRS MICKLEHAM I have no idea

The intruder produces her handkerchief but does not use it After all
she is in her best

THE HAGGERTY WOMAN Are they not back yet

Perfect ladies must reply to a direct question

MRS MICKLEHAM No icily We have been waiting this half hour They
are at the theatre again

THE HAGGERTY WOMAN You tell me I just popped in with an insignificant
present for him as his leave is up

MRS TWYMLEY The same errand brought us

THE HAGGERTY WOMAN My present is cigarettes

They have no intention of telling her what their presents are but the
secret leaps from them

MRS MICKLEHAM So is mine

MRS TWYMLEY Mine too

Triumph of the Haggerty Woman But it is shortlived

MRS MICKLEHAM Mine has gold tips

MRS TWYMLEY So has mine

The Haggerty Woman need not say a word You have only to look at her to
know that her cigarettes are not goldtipped She tries to brazen it
out which is so often a mistake

THE HAGGERTY WOMAN What care I Mine is Exquisytos

No wonder they titter

MRS MICKLEHAM Excuse us Mrs Haggerty if thats your name but the
word is Exquiseetos

THE HAGGERTY WOMAN Much obliged weeps

MRS MICKLEHAM I think I heard a taxi

MRS TWYMLEY It will be her third this week

They peer through the blind They are so excited that rank is forgotten

THE HAGGERTY WOMAN What is she in

MRS MICKLEHAM A new astrakhan jacket he gave her with Venus
sleeves

THE HAGGERTY WOMAN Has she sold her gabardine coat

MRS MICKLEHAM Not her She has them both at the theatre warm night
though it is Shes wearing the astrakhan and carrying the gabardine
flung carelesslike over her arm

THE HAGGERTY WOMAN I saw her strutting about with him yesterday
looking as if she thought the two of them made a procession

MRS TWYMLEY Hsh peeping Strike me dead if shes not coming
mincing down the stair hooked on his arm

Indeed it is thus that Mrs Dowey enters Perhaps she had seen shadows
lurking on the blind and at once hooked on to Kenneth to impress the
visitors She is quite capable of it

Now we see what Kenneth saw that afternoon five days ago when he emerged
from the bathroom and found the old trembler awaiting his inspection
Here are the muff and the gloves and the chiffon and such a kind old
bonnet that it makes you laugh at once I dont know how to describe it
but it is trimmed with a kiss as bonnets should be when the wearer is
old and frail We must take the merino for granted until she steps out
of the astrakhan She is dressed up to the nines there is no doubt
about it Yes but is her face less homely Above all has she style
The answer is in a stout affirmative Ask Kenneth He knows Many a time
he has had to go behind a door to roar hilariously at the old lady He
has thought of her as a lark to tell his mates about by and by but for
some reason that he cannot fathom he knows now that he will never do
that

MRS DOWEY Kenneth affecting surprise we have visitors

DOWEY Your servant ladies

He is no longer mudcaked and dour A very smart figure is this Private
Dowey and he winks engagingly at the visitors like one who knows that
for jolly company you cannot easily beat charwomen The pleasantries
that he and they have exchanged this week The sauce he has given them
The wit of Mrs Micklehams retorts The badinage of Mrs Twymley The
neat giggles of the Haggerty Woman There has been nothing like it since
you took the countess in to dinner

MRS TWYMLEY We should apologise Were not meaning to stay

MRS DOWEY You are very welcome Just waitthe ostentation of
thistill I get out of my astrakhanand my muffand my glovesand
it is the bonnets turn now my Excelsior

At last we see her in the merino a triumph

MRS MICKLEHAM Youve given her a glory time Mr Dowey

DOWEY Its her that has given it to me missis

MRS DOWEY Hey hey hey hey He just pampers me waggling her
fists The Lord forgive us but this being the last night we had a
sitdown supper at a restaurant Vehemently I swear by God that we
had champagny wine There is a dead stillness and she knows very well
what it means she has even prepared for it And to them as doubts my
wordheres the cork

She places the cork in its lovely gold drapery upon the table

MRS MICKLEHAM Im sure

MRS TWYMLEY I would thank you Mrs Dowey not to say a word against
my Alfred

MRS DOWEY Me

DOWEY Come come ladies in the masterful way that is so hard for
women to resist if you say another word Ill kiss the lot of you

There is a moment of pleased confusion

MRS MICKLEHAM Really them sodgers

THE HAGGERTY WOMAN The kilties is the worst

MRS TWYMLEY Im sure heartily we dont grudge you your treats
Mrs Dowey and sorry we are that this is the end

DOWEY Yes its the end with a troubled look at his old lady I
must be off in ten minutes

The little soul is too gallant to break down in company She hurries
into the pantry and shuts the door

MRS MICKLEHAM Poor thing But we must run for youll be having some
last words to say to her

DOWEY I kept her out long on purpose so as to have less time to say
them in

He more than half wishes that he could make a bolt to a publichouse

MRS TWYMLEY Its the best way In the important affairs of life
there is not much that any one can teach a charwoman Just a mere
nothing to wish you well Mr Dowey

All three present him with the cigarettes

MRS MICKLEHAM A scraping as one might say

THE HAGGERTY WOMAN The heart enigmatically is warm though it may
not be goldtipped

DOWEY You bricks

THE LADIES Good luck cocky

DOWEY The same to you And if you see a sodger man up there in a kilt
he is one that is going back with me Tell him not to come down
butbut to give me till the last minute and then to whistle

It is quite a grave man who is left alone thinking what to do next He
tries a horse laugh but that proves of no help He says Hell to
himself but it is equally ineffective Then he opens the pantry door
and calls

Old lady

She comes timidly to the door her hand up as if to ward off a blow

Is it time

An encouraging voice answers her

No no not yet Ive left word for Dixon to whistle when go I must

All is ended

Now then you promised to be gay We were to help one another

Yes Kenneth

Its bad for me but its worse for you

The men have medals to win you see

The women have their medals too He knows she likes him to order her
about so he tries it again

Come here No Ill come to you He stands gaping at her wonderingly
He has no power of words nor does he quite know what he would like to
say God

What is it Kenneth

Youre a woman

I had near forgot it

He wishes he was at the station with Dixon Dixon is sure to have a
bottle in his pocket They will be roaring a song presently But in
the meantimethere is that son business Blethers the whole thing
of courseor mostly blethers But its the way to please her

Have you noticed you have never called me son

Have I noticed it I was feared Kenneth You said I was on probation

And so you were Well the probations ended He laughs uncomfortably
The like of me But if you want me you can have me

Kenneth will I do

Woman artfully gay dont be so forward Wait till I have proposed

Propose for a mother

What for no In the grand style Mrs Dowey you queer carl you
spunky tiddy have I your permission to ask you the most important
question a neglected orphan can ask of an old lady

She bubbles with mirth Who could help it the man has such a way with
him

None of your sauce Kenneth

For a long time Mrs Dowey you cannot have been unaware of my sonnish
feelings for you

Wait till I get my mop to you

And if youre not willing to be my mother I swear Ill never ask
another

The old divert pulls him down to her and strokes his hair

Was I a wellbehaved infant mother

Not you sonny you were a rampaging rogue

Was I slow in learning to walk

The quickest in our street He he he She starts up Was that the
whistle

No no See here In taking me over you have in a manner of speaking
joined the Black Watch

I like to think that Kenneth

Then you must behave so that the ghost piper can be proud of you
Tion She stands bravely at attention Thats the style Now listen
Ive sent in your name as being my nearest of kin and your allowance
will be coming to you weekly in the usual way

Hey hey hey Is it wicked Kenneth

Ill take the responsibility for it in both worlds You see I want you
to be safeguarded in case anything hap

Kenneth

Tion Have no fear Ill come back covered with mud and medals Mind
you have that cup of tea waiting for me He is listening for the
whistle He pulls her on to his knee

Hey hey hey hey

What fun well have writing to one another Real letters this time

Yes

It would be a good plan if you began the first letter as soon as Ive
gone

I will

I hope Lady Dolly will go on sending me cakes

You may be sure

He ties his scarf round her neck

You must have been a bonny thing when you were young

Away with you

That scarf sets you fine

Blue was always my colour

The whistle sounds

Old lady you are what Blighty means to me now

She hides in the pantry again She is out of sight to us but she
does something that makes Private Dowey take off his bonnet Then
he shoulders his equipment and departs That is he laughing coarsely
with Dixon

We have one last glimpse of the old ladya month or two after Kenneths
death in action It would be rosemary to us to see her in her black
dress of which she is very proud but let us rather peep at her in the
familiar garments that make a third to her mop and pail It is early
morning and she is having a look at her medals before setting off on
the daily round They are in a drawer with the scarf covering them and
on the scarf a piece of lavender First the black frock which she
carries in her arms like a baby Then her War Savings Certificates
Kenneths bonnet a thin packet of real letters and the famous
champagne cork She kisses the letters but she does not blub over them
She strokes the dress and waggles her head over the certificates and
presses the bonnet to her cheeks and rubs the tinsel of the cork
carefully with her apron She is a tremulous old un yet she exults
for she owns all these things and also the penny flag on her breast
She puts them away in the drawer the scarf over them the lavender on
the scarf Her air of triumph well becomes her She lifts the pail and
the mop and slouches off gamely to the days toil






THE NEW WORD


Any room nowadays must be the scene for any father and any son are the
dramatis personae We could pick them up in Mayfair in Tooting
on the Veldt in rectories or in grocers back parlours dump them down
on our toy stage and tell them to begin It is a great gathering to
choose from but our needs are small Let the company shake hands and
all go away but two

The two who have remained it is discovered on inquiry are Mr Torrance
and his boy so let us make use of them Torrance did not linger in
order to be chosen he was anxious like all of them to be off but we
recognised him and sternly signed to him to stay Not that we knew him
personally but the fact is we remembered him we never forget a face
as the legal person who reads out the names of the jury before the court
opens and who brushes aside your reasons for wanting to be let off It
pleases our humour to tell Mr Torrance that we cannot let him off

He does not look so formidable as when last we saw him and this is
perhaps owing to our no longer being hunched with others on those
unfeeling benches It is not because he is without a wig for we saw
him on the occasion to which we are so guardedly referring both in a
wig and out of it he passed behind a screen without it and immediately
as quickly as we write popped out in it giving it a finishing touch
rather like the butlers wriggle to his coat as he goes to the door
There are the two kinds of learned brothers those who use the screen
and those who so far as the jury knows sleep in their wigs The latter
are the swells and include the judges whom however we have seen in
the public thoroughfares without their wigs a horrible sight that has
doubtless led many an onlooker to crime

Mr Torrance then is no great luminary indeed when we accompany him
to his house as we must in order to set our scene properly we find
that it is quite a suburban affair only one servant kept and her niece
engaged twice a week to crawl about the floors There is no fire in the
drawingroom so the family remain on after dinner in the diningroom
which rather gives them away There is really no one in the room but
Roger That is the truth of it though to the unseeing eye all the
family are there except Roger They consist of Mr Mrs and Miss
Torrance Mr Torrance is enjoying his evening paper and a cigar and
every line of him is insisting stubbornly that nothing unusual is
happening in the house In the home circle and now that we think of it
even in court he has the reputation of being a somewhat sarcastic
gentleman he must be dogged too otherwise he would have ceased long
ago to be sarcastic to his wife on whom wit falls like pellets on
sandbags all the dents they make are dimples

Mrs Torrance is at present exquisitely employed she is listening to
Rogers step overhead You know what a delightful step the boy has And
what is more remarkable is that Emma is listening to it too Emma who is
seventeen and who has been trying to keep Roger in his place ever since
he first compelled her to bowl to him Things have come to a pass when
a sister so openly admits that she is only number two in the house

Remarks well worthy of being recorded fall from these two ladies as they
gaze upward I thinkdidnt I Emma is the mothers contribution
while it is Emma who replies in a whisper No not yet

Mr Torrance calmly reads or seems to read for it is not possible that
there can be anything in the paper as good as this Indeed he
occasionally casts a humorous glance at his womenfolk Perhaps he is
trying to steady them Let us hope he has some such good reason for
breaking in from time to time on their entrancing occupation

Listen to this dear It is very important The paper says upon
apparently good authority that love laughs at locksmiths

His wife answers without lowering her eyes Did you speak John I am
listening

Yes I was telling you that the Hidden Hand has at last been discovered
in a tub in Russell Square

I hear John How thoughtful

And so they must have been made of margarine my love

I shouldnt wonder John

Hence the name Petrograd

Oh was that the reason

You will be pleased to hear Ellen that the honourable gentleman then
resumed his seat

That was nice of him

As I goodnaturedly now resume mine having made my usual
impression

Yes John

Emma slips upstairs to peep through a keyhole and it strikes her mother
that John has been saying something They are on too good terms to make
an apology necessary She observes blandly John I havent heard a
word you said

Im sure you havent woman

I cant help being like this John

Go on being like yourself dear

Am I foolish

Um

Oh but John how can you be so calmwith him up there

He has been up there a good deal you know since we presented him to
an astounded world nineteen years ago

But hehe is not going to be up there much longer John She sits on
the arm of his chair so openly to wheedle him that it is not worth his
while to smile Her voice is tremulous she is a woman who can conceal
nothing You will be nice to himtonightwont you John

Mr Torrance is a little pained Do I just begin tonight Ellen

Oh no no but I think he is rathershy of you at times

That he says a little wryly is because he is my son Ellen

Yesits strange butyes

With a twinkle that is not all humorous Did it ever strike you Ellen
that I am a bitshy of him

She is indeed surprised Of Rogie

I suppose it is because I am his father

She presumes that this is his sarcasm again and lets it pass at that
It reminds her of what she wants to say

You are so sarcastic she has never quite got the meaning of this
word to Rogie at times Boys dont like that John

Is that so Ellen

Of course I dont mind your being sarcastic to me

Much good groaning my being sarcastic to you You are so seldom
aware of it

I am not asking you to be a mother to him John

Thank you my dear

She does not know that he is sarcastic again I quite understand that
a man cant think all the time about his son as a mother does

Cant he Ellen What makes you so sure of that

I mean that a boy naturally goes to his mother with his troubles rather
than to his father Rogie tells me everything

Mr Torrance is stung I daresay he might tell me things he wouldnt
tell you

She smiles at this It is very probably sarcasm

I want you to be serious just now Why not show more warmth to him
John

With an unspoken sigh It would terrify him Ellen Two men show warmth
to each other Shame woman

Two men indignantly John he is only nineteen

Thats all patting her hand Ellen it is the great age to be
today nineteen

Emma darts in

Mother he has unlocked the door He is taking a last look at himself
in the mirror before coming down

Having made the great announcement she is off again

You wont be sarcastic John

I give you my wordif you promise not to break down

Rashly I promise She hurries to the door and back again John Ill
contrive to leave you and him alone together for a little

Mr Torrance is as alarmed as if the judge had looked over the bench and
asked where he was For Gods sake woman dont do that Father and
son Hell bolt or if he doesnt I will

Emma Torrance flings open the door grandly and we learn what all the
todo is about

EMMA Allow me to introduce nd Lieutenant Torrance of the Royal
Sussex Fatheryour son nd Lieutenant Torranceyour father
Motheryour little Rogie

Roger in uniform walks in strung up for the occasion Or the uniform
comes forward with Roger inside it He has been a very ordinary nice boy
up to now dull at his books by an effort Mr Torrance had sent him
to an obscure boardingschool but at sixteen it was evident that an
office was the proper place for Roger Before the war broke out he was
treasurer of the local lawn tennis club and his golf handicap was
seven he carried his little bag daily to and from the city and his
highest relaxation was giggling with girls or about them Socially he
had fallen from the standards of the home even now that he is in his
uniform the hasty might say something clever about temporary
gentlemen

But there are great ideas buzzing in Rogers head which would never
have been there save for the war At present he is chiefly conscious of
his clothes His mother embraces him with cries of rapture while Mr
Torrance surveys him quizzically over the paper and Emma rushing to
the piano which is of such an oldfashioned kind that it can also be
used as a sideboard plays See the Conquering Hero Comes

ROGER in an agony Mater do stop that chit making an ass of me

He must be excused for his mater That was the sort of school and his
mother is rather proud of the phrase though it sometimes makes his
father wince

MRS TORRANCE Emma please dont But Im sure you deserve it my
darling Doesnt he John

MR TORRANCE missing his chance Hardly yet you know Cant be
exactly a conquering hero the first night you put them on can you
Roger

ROGER hotly Did I say I was

MRS TORRANCE Oh John Do turn round Rogie I never didI never
did

EMMA Isnt he a pet

ROGER Shut up Emma

MRS TORRANCE challenging the world Though I say it who shouldntand
yet why shouldnt I

MR TORRANCE In any case you willso go ahead mater

MRS TORRANCE I knew he would look splendid but Iof course I
couldnt know that he would look quite so splendid as this

ROGER I know I look a bally ass That is why I was such a time in
coming down

MR TORRANCE We thought we heard you upstairs strutting about

MRS TORRANCE John Dont mind him Rogie

ROGER haughtily I dont

MR TORRANCE Oh

ROGER But I wasnt strutting

MRS TORRANCE That dreadful sword No I would prefer you not to draw
it dearnot till necessity makes you

MR TORRANCE Come come Ellen thats rather hard lines on the boy
If he isnt to draw it here where is he to draw it

EMMA with pride At the Front father

MR TORRANCE I thought they left them at home nowadays Roger

ROGER Yes mater you see they are a bit in the way

MRS TORRANCE foolishly Not when you have got used to them

MR TORRANCE That isnt what Roger means His son glares

EMMA who though she has not formerly thought much of Roger is now
proud to trot by his side and will henceforth count the salutes I know
what he means If you carry a sword the snipers know you are an officer
and they try to pick you off

MRS TORRANCE Its no wonder they are called Huns Fancy a British
sniper doing that Roger you will be very careful wont you in the
trenches

ROGER Honour bright mater

MRS TORRANCE Above all dont look up

MR TORRANCE The trenches ought to be so deep that they cant look up

MRS TORRANCE What a good idea John

ROGER Hes making game of you mater

MRS TORRANCE unruffled Is he my ownvery likely Now about the
question of provisions

ROGER Oh lummy you talk as if I was going off tonight I maynt go
for months and months

MRS TORRANCE I knowand of course there is a chance that you may
not be needed at all

ROGER poor boy None of that mater

MRS TORRANCE There is something I want to ask you JohnHow long do
you think the war is likely to last Her John resumes his paper
Rogie I know you will laugh at me but there are some things that I
could not help getting for you

ROGER You know you have knitted enough things already to fit up my
whole platoon

MRS TORRANCE proud almost to tears His platoon

EMMA Have you noticed how fine all the words in oon are Platoon
Dragoon

MR TORRANCE Spitoon

EMMA Colonel is good but rather papaish Major is nosey Admiral of
the Fleet is scrumptious but Marechal de Francethat is the best of
all

MRS TORRANCE I think there is nothing so nice as nd Lieutenant
Gulping Lot of little boys

ROGER Mater

MRS TORRANCE I mean just think of their cold feet She produces
many parcels and displays their strange contents Those are for putting
inside your socks Those are for outside your socks I am told that it
is also advisable to have straw in your boots

MR TORRANCE Have you got him some straw

MRS TORRANCE I thought John he could get it there But if you
think

ROGER Hes making fun of you again mater

MRS TORRANCE I shouldnt wonder Here are some overalls One is
leather and one fur and this one is waterproof The worst of it is that
they are from different shops and each says that the others keep the
damp in or draw the feet They have such odd names too There are new
names for everything nowadays Vests are called cuirasses Are you
laughing at me Rogie

MR TORRANCE sharply If he is laughing he ought to be ashamed of
himself

ROGER barking Who was laughing

MRS TORRANCE John

Emma cuffs her father playfully

MR TORRANCE All very well Emma but its past your bedtime

EMMA indignantly You cant expect me to sleep on a night like this

MR TORRANCE You can try

MRS TORRANCE nd Lieutenant nd Lieutenant

MR TORRANCE alarmed Ellen dont break down You promised

MRS TORRANCE I am not going to break down butbut there is a
photograph of Rogie when he was very small

MR TORRANCE Go to bed

MRS TORRANCE I happento have it in my pocket

ROGER Dont bring it out mater

MRS TORRANCE If I break down John it wont be owing to the picture
itself so much as because of what is written on the back

She produces it dolefully

MR TORRANCE Then dont look at the back

He takes it from her

MRS TORRANCE not very hopeful of herself But I know what is written
on the back Roger John Torrance aged two years four months and
thirtythree pounds

MR TORRANCE Correct She weeps softly There there woman He
signs imploringly to Emma

EMMA kissing him Im going to byby Night mammy Night Rog She
is about to offer him her cheek then salutes instead and rushes off
with Roger in pursuit

MRS TORRANCE I shall leave you together John

MR TORRANCE half liking it but nervous Do you think its wise
With a groan You know what I am

MRS TORRANCE Do be nice to him dear Rogers return finds her very
artful indeed I wonder where I put my glasses

ROGER Ill look for them

MRS TORRANCE No I remember now They are upstairs in such a funny
place that I must go myself Do you remember Rogie that I hoped they
would reject you on account of your eyes

ROGER I suppose you couldnt help it

MRS TORRANCE beaming on her husband Did you believe I really meant
it John

MR TORRANCE curious Did you Roger

ROGER Of course Didnt you father

MR TORRANCE No I knew the old lady better

He takes her hand

MRS TORRANCE sweetly I shouldnt have liked it Rogie dear Ill
tell you something You know your brother Harry died when he was seven
To you I suppose it is as if he had never been You were barely five

ROGER I dont remember him mater

MRS TORRANCE Nono But I do Rogie He would be twentyone now but
though you and Emma grew up I have always gone on seeing him as just
seven Always till the war broke out And now I see him a man of
twentyone dressed in khaki fighting for his country same as you
I wouldnt have had one of you stay at home though I had had a dozen
That is if it is the noble war they all say it is Im not clever
Rogie I have to take it on trust Surely they wouldnt deceive mothers
Ill get my glasses

She goes away leaving the father and son somewhat moved It is Mr
Torrance who speaks first gruffly

Like to change your mother Roger

The answer is also gruff What do you think

Then silence falls These two are very conscious of being together
without so much as the tick of a clock to help them The father clings
to his cigar sticks his knife into it studies the leaf tries crossing
his legs another way The son examines the pictures on the walls as if
he had never seen them before and is all the time edging toward the
door

Mr Torrance wets his lips it must be now or never Not going Roger

Roger counts the chairs Yes I thought

Wont yousit down andhave a chat

Roger is bowled over A what You and me

Why not rather truculently

Ohoh all right sitting uncomfortably

The cigar gets several more stabs

I suppose you catch an early train tomorrow

The  I have flagsignalling at halfpast six

Phew Hours before I shall be up

I suppose so

Well you neednt dwell on it Roger

Indignantly I didnt He starts up Goodnight father

Goodnight Damn Come back My fault Didnt I say I wanted to have
a chat with you

I thought we had had it

Gloomingly No such luck

There is another pause A frightened ember in the fire makes an appeal
to some one to say something Mr Torrance rises It is now he who is
casting eyes at the door He sits again ashamed of himself

I like your uniform Roger he says pleasantly

Roger wriggles Havent you made fun of me enough

Sharply Im not making fun of you Dont you see Im trying to tell
you that Im proud of you

Roger is at last aware of it with a sinking He appeals Good lord
father you are not going to begin now

The father restrains himself

Do you remember Roger my saying that I didnt want you to smoke till
you were twenty

Oh its that is it Shutting his mouth tight I never promised

Almost with a shout Its not that Then kindly Have a cigar my boy

Me

A rather shaky hand passes him a cigar case Roger selects from it and
lights up nervously He is now prepared for the worst

Have you ever wondered Roger what sort of a fellow I am

Guardedly Often

Mr Torrance casts all sense of decency to the winds such is one of the
effects of war

I have often wondered what sort of fellow you are Roger We have both
been at it on the sly I suppose that is what makes a father and son so
uncomfortable in each others presence

Roger is not yet prepared to meet him halfway but he casts a line

Do you feel the creeps when you are left alone with me

Mortally Roger My first instinct is to slip away

So is mine with deep feeling

You dont say so with such surprise that the father undoubtedly goes
up a step in the sons estimation I always seem to know what you are
thinking Roger

Do you Same here

As a consequence it is better it is right it is only decent that you
and I should be very chary of confidences with each other

Roger is relieved Im dashed glad you see it in that way

Oh quite And yet Roger if you had to answer this question on oath
Whom do you think you are most like in this world I dont mean
superficially but deep down in your vitals what would you say Your
mother your uncle one of your friends on the golf links

No

Who

Darkly You

Just how I feel

There is such true sympathy in the manly avowal that Roger cannot but be
brought closer to his father

Its pretty ghastly father

It is I dont know which it is worse for

They consider each other without bitterness

You are a bit of a wag at times Roger

You soon shut me up

I have heard that you sparkle more freely in my absence

They say the same about you

And now that you mention it I believe it is true and yet isnt it
a bigger satisfaction to you to catch me relishing your jokes than any
other person

Rogers eyes open wide How did you know that

Because I am so bucked if I see you relishing mine

Are you Rogers hold on the certain things in life are
slipping You dont show it

That is because of our awkward relationship

Roger lapses into gloom We have got to go through with it

His father kicks the coals Theres no way out

No

We have as it were signed a compact Roger never to let on that we
care for each other As gentlemen we must stick to it

Yes What are you getting at father

There is a war on Roger

That neednt make any difference

Yes it does Roger be ready I hate to hit you without warning Im
going to cast a grenade into the middle of you Its this Im fond of
you my boy

Roger squirms Father if any one were to hear you

They wont The door is shut Amy is gone to bed and all is quiet in
our street Wont youwont you say something civil to me in return
Roger

Roger looks at him and away from him I sometimesbragged about you
at school

Mr Torrance is absurdly pleased Did you What sort of things Roger

II forget

Come on Roger

Is this fair father

No I suppose it isnt Mr Torrance attacks the coals again You and
your mother have lots of confidences havent you

I tell her a good deal Somehow

Yes somehow one can With the artfulness that comes of years Im
glad you tell her everything

Roger looks down his cigar Not everything father There are
thingsabout oneself

Arent there Roger

Best not to tell her

Yesyes If there are any of them you would care to tell me
insteadjust if you want to mindjust if you are in a hole or
anything

No thanks very stiffly

Any little debts for instance

Thats all right now Mother

She did

Roger is ready to jump at him I was willing to speak to you about
them but

She said Not worth while bothering father

How did you know

Oh I have met your mother before you see Nothing else

No

Havent been an ass about a girl or anything of that sort

Good lord father

I shouldnt have said it In my young days we sometimesIts all
different now

I dont know I could tell you things that would surprise you

No Not about yourself

No At least

Just as you like Roger

It blew over long ago

Then theres no need

Nooh no It was justyou knowthe old old story

He eyes his father suspiciously but not a muscle in Mr Torrances
countenance is out of place

I see It hasntleft you bitter about the sex Roger I hope

Not now Sheyou know what women are

Yes yes

You neednt mention it to mother

I wont Mr Torrance is elated to share a secret with Roger about
which mother is not to know Think your mother and I are an aged pair
Roger

I neverof course you are not young

How long have you known that I mean its truebut I didnt know it
till quite lately

That youre old

Hang it Roger not so bad as thatelderly This will stagger you but
I assure you that until the other day I jogged along thinking of myself
as on the whole still one of the juveniles He makes a wry face I
crossed the bridge Roger without knowing it

What made you know

What makes us know all the new things Rogerthe war Ill tell you
a secret When we realised in August of  that myriads of us were to
be needed my first thought wasnt that I had a son but that I must get
fit myself

You

Funny isnt it says Mr Torrance quite nastily But as I tell you
I didnt know I had ceased to be young I went into Regents Park and
tried to run a mile

Lummy you might have killed yourself

I nearly didespecially as I had put a weight on my shoulders to
represent my kit I kept at it for a week but I knew the game was up
The discovery was pretty grim Roger

Dont you bother about that part of it You are doing your share
taking care of mother and Emma

Mr Torrance emits a laugh of selfcontempt I am not taking care of
them It is you who are taking care of them My friend you are the head
of the house now

Father

Yes we have come back to hard facts and the defender of the house is
the head of it

Me Fudge

Its true The thing that makes me wince most is that some of my
contemporaries have managed to squeeze back back into youth Roger
though I guess they were a pretty tight fit in the turnstile There is
Coxon he is in khaki now with his hair dyed and when he and I meet at
the club we know that we belong to different generations Im a decent
old fellow but I dont really count any more while Coxon lucky dog
is being damned daily on parade

I hate your feeling it in that way father

I dont say it is a palatable draught but when the war is over we
shall all shake down to the new conditions No fear of my being
sarcastic to you then Roger Ill have to be jolly respectful

Shut up father

Youve begun you see Dont worry Roger Any rawness I might feel
in having missed the chance of seeing whether I was a manlike Coxon
confound himis swallowed up in the pride of giving the chance to
you Im in a shiver about you butIts all true Roger what your
mother said about nd Lieutenants Till the other day we were so little
of a military nation that most of us didnt know there were nd
Lieutenants And now in thousands of homes we feel that there is
nothing else nd Lieutenant It is like a new word to usone I
daresay of many that the war will add to our language We have taken
to it Roger If a son of mine were to tarnish it

Ill try not to Roger growls

If you did I should just know that there had been something wrong
about me

Gruffly Youre all right

If I am you are It is a winning face that Mr Torrance turns on his
son I suppose you have been asking yourself of late what if you were
to turn out to be a funk

Father how did you know

I know because you are me Because ever since there was talk of this
commission I have been thinking and thinking what were you thinkingso
as to help you

This itself is a help Rogers handbut he withdraws it hurriedly

They all seem to be so frightfully brave father he says wistfully

I expect Roger that the best of them had the same qualms as you
before their first engagement

II kind of think father that I wont be a funk

I kind of think so too Roger Mr Torrance forgets himself Mind you
dont be rash my boy and for Gods sake keep your head down in the
trenches

Roger has caught him out He points a gay finger at his anxious father

You know you laughed at mother for saying that

Did I Roger your mother thinks that I have an unfortunate manner with
you

The magnanimous Roger says Oh I dont know Its just the
fatherandson complication

That is really all it is But she thinks I should show my affection for
you more openly

Roger wriggles again Earnestly I wouldnt do that Nicely Of
course for this oncebut in a general way I wouldnt do that We
know you and I

As long as we know its no one elses affair is it

Thats the ticket father

Still It is to be feared that Mr Torrance is now taking advantage
of his superior slyness Still before your motherto please hereh

Faltering I suppose it would

Well what do you say

I know she would like it

Of course you and I know that display of that sort is all
bunkumrepellent even to our natures

Lord yes

But to gratify her

I should be so conscious

Mr Torrance is here quite as sincere as his son So should I

Roger considers it How far would you go

Oh not far Suppose I called you Old Rogie Theres not much in
that

It all depends on the way one says these things

I should be quite casual

Hum What would you like me to call you

Severely It isnt what would I like But I daresay your mother
would beam if you called me dear father

I dont think so

You know quite well that you think so Roger

Its so effeminate

Not if you say it casually

With something very like a snort Roger asks How does one say a thing
like that casually

Well for instance you could whistle while you said itor anything of
that sort

Hum Of course youif we were tobe like that you wouldnt do
anything

How do you mean

You wouldnt paw me

Roger with some natural indignation you forget yourself But
apparently it is for him to continue That reminds me of a story I
heard the other day of a French general He had asked for volunteers
from his airmen for some specially dangerous joband they all stepped
forward Pretty good that Then three were chosen and got their orders
and saluted and were starting off when he stopped them Since when
he said have brave boys departing to the post of danger omitted to
embrace their father They did it then Good story

Roger lowers They were French

Yes I said so Dont you think its good

Why do you tell it to me

Because its a good story

You are sure father sternly that there is no other reason Mr
Torrance tries to brazen it out but he looks guilty You know father
that is barred

Just because he knows that he has been playing it low Mr Torrance
snaps angrily What is barred

You know says his monitor

Mr Torrance shouts

I know that you are a young ass

Really father

Hold your tongue

Roger can shout also

I must say father

Be quiet I tell you

It is in the middle of this competition that the lady who dotes on them
both chooses to come back still without her spectacles

Oh dear And I had hopedOh John

Mr Torrance would like to kick himself

My fault he says with a groan

But whatever is the matter

Nothing mater The war is already making Roger quite smart Only
father wouldnt do as I told him

Mr Torrance cannot keep pace with his sons growth He raps out Why
the dickens should I

Roger is imperturbable this will be useful in France You see mater
he said I was the head of the house

You Rogie She goes to her husbands side What nonsense

Roger grins Do you like my joke father

The father smiles upon him and is at once uproariously happy He digs
his boy boldly in the ribs

Roger you scoundrel

Thats better says Mrs Torrance at a venture

Roger feels that things have perhaps gone far enough I think Ill go
to my room now You will come up mater

Yes dear I shant be five minutes John

More like half an hour

She hesitates There is nothing wrong is there I thought I noticed
aa

A certain liveliness my dear No we were only having a good talk

What about John wistfully

About the war Roger breaks in hurriedly

About tactics and strategy wasnt it Roger

Yes

The fact is Ellen I have been helping Roger to take his first
trench With a big breath And we took it too together didnt we
Roger

You bet says Roger valiantly

Though I suppose sighing it is one of those trenches that the enemy
retake during the night

Oh II dont know father

The lady asks Whatever are you two talking about

Aha says Mr Torrance in high feather patting her but unable to
resist a slight boast it is very private We dont tell you
everything you know Ellen

She beams though she does not understand

Come on mater its only his beastly sarcasm again Night father I
wont see you in the morning

Night says Mr Torrance

But Roger has not gone yet He seems to be looking for somethinga
book perhaps Then he begins to whistlecasually

Goodnight dear father

Mr John Torrance is left alone rubbing his hands






BARBARAS WEDDING


The Colonel is in the sittingroom of his country cottage staring
through the open windows at his pretty garden He is a very old man and
is sometimes bewildered nowadays He calls to Dering the gardener who
is on a ladder pruning Dering who comes to him is a rough capable
young fellow with fingers that are already becoming stumpy because he so
often uses his hands instead of a spade This is a sign that Dering will
never get on in the world His mind is in the same condition as his
fingers working back to clods He will get a rise of one and sixpence
in a year or two and marry on it and become duller and heavier and in
short the clever ones could already write his epitaph

                                   

A beautiful morning Dering

Too much sun sir The roses be complaining and to make matters
worse Miss Barbara has been watering of themin the heat of the day

The Colonel is a very gentle knight nowadays Has she She means well
But that is not what is troubling him He approaches the subject
diffidently Dering you heard it didnt you He is longing to be
told that Dering heard it

What was that sir

The thunderstormearly this morning

There was no thunderstorm sir

Dispirited That is what they all say The Colonel is too courteous to
contradict any one but he tries again there is about him the
insistence of one who knows that he is right It was at four oclock I
got up and looked out at the window The evening primroses were very
beautiful

Dering is equally dogged I dont hold much with evening primroses
sir but I was out and about at four there was no thunderstorm

The Colonel still thinks that there was a thunderstorm but he wants to
placate Dering I suppose I just thought there was one Perhaps it was
some thunderstorm of long ago that I heard They do come back you
know

Heavily Do they sir

I am glad to see you moving about in the garden Dering with
everything just as usual

There is a cautious slyness about this as if the Colonel was fishing
for information but it is too clever for Dering who is going with a
Thank you sir

No dont go The old man lowers his voice and makes a confession
reluctantly I ama little troubled Dering

Dering knows that his master has a wandering mind and he answers
nicely Everything be all right sir

Im glad of that the Colonel says with relief It is pleasant to see
that you have come back Dering Why did you go away for such a long
time

Me sir Dering is a little aggrieved I havent had a day off since
Christmas

Havent you I thought

The Colonel tries to speak casually but there is a trembling eagerness
in his voice Is everything just as usual Dering

Yes sir There never were a place less changed than this

Thats true The Colonel is appeased Thank you Dering for saying
that But next moment he has lowered his voice again Dering there is
nothing wrong is there Is anything happening that I am not being told
about

Not that I know of sir

That is what they all say butI dont know He stares at his old
sword which is hanging on the wall Dering I feel as if I was needed
somewhere I dont know where it is No one will tell me Where is every
one

Theyre all about sir Theres a cricket match on at the village
green

Is there

If the wind had a bit of south in it you could hear their voices You
were a bit of a nailer at cricket yourself sir

The Colonel sees himself standing up to fast ones He is gleeful over
his reminiscences

Ninetynine against Mallowfield and then bowled off my pads Biggest
score I ever made Mallowfield wanted to add one to make it the hundred
but I wouldnt let them I was pretty good at steering them through the
slips Dering Do you remember my late cut It didnt matter where point
stood I got past him You used to stand at point Dering

That was my grandfather sir If he was to be believed he used to snap
you regular at point

The Colonel is crestfallen but he has a disarming smile Did he I
daresay he did I cant play now but I like to watch it still He
becomes troubled again Dering there is no cricket on the green
today I have been down to look I dont understand it Dering When I
got there the green was all dotted with themits the prettiest sight
and sound in England But as I watched them they began to go away one
and two at a time they werent given out you know they went as if
they had been called away Some of the little shavers stayed onand
then they went off as if they had been called away too The stumps were
left lying about Why is it

Its just fancy sir Dering says soothingly I saw Master Will
oiling his bat yesterday

Did you avidly I should have liked to see that I have often oiled
their bats for them Careless lads they always forget Was that nice
German boy with him

Mr Karl Not far off sir He was sitting by the bank of the stream
playing on his flute and Miss Barbara she had climbed one of my
appletreesshe says they are your trees He lowers

They are you know Dering the Colonel says meekly

Yes sir in a sense brushing the spurious argument aside but I
dont like any of you to meddle with them And there she sat pelting
the two of them with green apples

How like her The Colonel shakes his head indulgently I dont know
how we are to make a demure young lady of her

Dering smirks They say in the village sir that Master Will would
like to try

To the Colonel this is wit of a high order

Ha ha he is just a colt himself But the laughter breaks off He
seems to think that he will get the truth if Dering comes closer Who
are all here now Dering in the house I mean I sometimes forget They
grow old so quickly They go out at one door in the bloom of youth and
come back by another tired and grey Havent you noticed it

No sir The only visitors staying here are Miss Barbara and Mr Karl
Theres just them and yourselves sir you and the mistress and Master
Will Thats all

Yes thats all his master says still unconvinced Who is the
soldier Dering

Soldier sir There is no soldier here except yourself

Isnt there There was a nurse with him Who is ill

No one sir Theres no nurse Dering backs away from the old man
Would you like me to call the mistress sir

No she has gone down to the village She told me why but I forget
Miss Barbara is with her

Miss Barbara is down by the stream sir

Is she I think they said they were going to a wedding With an old
mans curiosity Who is being married today Dering

I have heard of no wedding sir But here is Miss Barbara

It is perhaps the first time that Dering has been glad to see Miss
Barbara who romps in a merry hoyden running over with animal spirits

Heres the tomboy the Colonel cries gaily

Barbara looks suspiciously from one to the other

Dering I believe you are complaining to the Colonel about my watering
the flowers at the wrong time of day

Aha Aha The Colonel thinks she is even wittier than Dering who is
properly abashed

I did just mention it miss

You horrid Barbara shakes her mop of hair at the gardener Dear
dont mind him And every time he says they are his flowers and
his apples you tell me and I shall say to his face that they
are yours

The courage of those young things says the happy Colonel

Derings underlip becomes very pronounced but he goes off into the
garden Barbara attempts to attend to the Colonels needs

Let me make you comfythe way granny does it

She arranges his cushions clumsily

That is not quite the way she does it the Colonel says softly Do
you call her granny Barbara

She asked me tofor practice Barbara is curious Dont you remember
why

Of course the Colonel remembers

I know Billy boy

You are quick today Now wait till I get your cane

I dont need my cane while Im sitting

You look so beauful sitting holding your cane She knocks over his
cushions Oh dear I am a clumsy

Politely Not at all but perhaps if I were to do it for myself He
makes himself comfortable Thats better Thank you Barbara very
much

I didnt do it Im all thumbs What a ghastly nurse I should
make

Nurse The Colonels troubles return to him Who is she Barbara

Who is who dear

That nurse

Theres no nurse here

Isnt there

Barbara feels that she is of less use than ever today Where is
granny

She has gone down to the village to a wedding

Theres no wedding Who could be being married

I think its people I know but I cant remember who they are I
thought you went too Barbara

Not I Catch me missing it if there had been a wedding

You and the nurse

Dear you have just been imagining things again Shall I play to you
or sing She knocks over a chair Oh dear everything catches in me
Would you like me to Robin Adair dear

The Colonel is polite but firm No thank you Barbara For a few
moments he forgets her his mind has gone wandering again Barbara the
house seems so empty Where are Billy and Karl

Billy is where Karl is you may be sure

And where is Karl

He is where Billy boy is you may be sure

And where are they both

Not far from where Barbara is you bet She flutters to the window and
waves her hand Do you hear Karls flute They have been down all the
morning at the pool where the alder is trying to catch that
bulltrout

They didnt get him Ill swear

You can ask them

I spent a lot of my youth trying to get that bulltrout I tumbled in
there sixty years ago

I tumbled in sixty minutes ago It cant be the same trout dear

Same old rascal

Billy and Karl come in by the window leaving a fishingrod outside
They are gay careless attractive youths

BARBARA with her nose in the air You muddy things

COLONEL gaily firing his dart Did you get the bulltrout Billy boy

BILLY Hes a brute that

COLONEL He is you know

BILLY He came up several times and had a look at my fly Didnt flick
it or do anything as complimentary as that Just yawned and went down

COLONEL Yawned did he Used to wink in my time Did you and Billy
fish at Heidelberg Karl

KARL We were more worthily employed sir but we did unbend at times
Billy do you remember He begins a gay dance

BILLY Not I Then he joins in

BARBARA Young gentlemen how disgraceful She joins in

COLONEL Harumscarums

KARL Does he know about you two

BILLY He often forgets Ill tell him again Grandfather Barbara and
I have something to say to you Its this He puts his arm round
Barbara

COLONEL smiling I knowI know Theres nothing like it Im very
glad Barbara

BARBARA You see dear Ive loved Billy boy since the days when he
tried to catch the bulltrout with a string and a bent pin and I held
on to his pinafore to prevent his tumbling in We used to play at school
at marrying and giving in marriage and the girl who was my bridegroom
had always to take the name of Billy Do you woman take this man
Billy the clergyman in skirts began and before I could answer
diffidently some other girl was sure to shout I should rather think
she does

COLONEL in high good humour Dont forget the ring Billy You know
when I was married I think I couldnt find the ring

KARL Were you married here sir

COLONEL Yes at the village church

BILLY So were my father and mother

COLONEL as his eyes wander to the garden I remember walking back with
my wife and bringing her in here through the window She kissed some of
the furniture

BILLY I suppose you would like a grander affair Barbara

BARBARA No just the same

BILLY I hoped you would say that

BARBARA But Billy Im to have such a dream of a wedding gown
Granny is going with me to London to choose itlaying her head on the
Colonels shoulderif you can do without her for a day dear

COLONEL gallantly I shall go with you I couldnt trust you and
granny to choose the gown

KARL You must often be pretty lonely sir when we are all out and
about enjoying ourselves

COLONEL They all say that But that is the time when Im not lonely
Karl Its then I see things most clearlythe past I suppose It all
comes crowding back to meIndia the Crimea India againand its so
real especially the people They come and talk to me I seem to see
them I dont know they havent been here Billy till your granny tells
me afterwards

BILLY Yes I know I wonder where granny is

BARBARA It isnt often she leaves you for so long dear

COLONEL She told me she had to go out but I forget where Oh yes
she has gone down to the village to a wedding

BILLY A wedding

BARBARA Its curious how he harps on that

COLONEL She said to me to listen and I would hear the wedding bells

BARBARA Not today dear

BILLY Best not to worry him

BARBARA But granny says we should try to make things clear to him

BILLY Was any one with granny when she said she was going to a wedding

COLONEL like one begging her to admit it You were there Barbara

BARBARA No dear He said that to me before And something about a
nurse

COLONEL obstinately She was there too

BILLY Any one else

COLONEL There was that soldier

BARBARA A soldier also

COLONEL Just those three

BILLY But that makes four Granny and Barbara and a nurse and a
soldier

COLONEL They were all there but there were only three

BILLY Odd

BARBARA soothingly Never mind dear Granny will make it all right
She is the one for you

COLONEL She is the one for me

KARL If there had been a wedding wouldnt she have taken the Colonel
with her

BARBARA Of course she would

KARL You are not too old to have a kind eye for a wedding sir

COLONEL wagging his head Aha aha You know if I had gone very
likely I should have kissed the bride Brides look so pretty on their
wedding day They are often not pretty at other times but they are all
pretty on their wedding day

KARL You have an eye for a pretty girl still sir

COLONEL Yes I have yes I have

BARBARA I do believe I see it all Granny has been talking to you
about Billy boy and me and you havent been able to wait you have
hurried on the wedding

BILLY Bravo Barbara youve got it

COLONEL doubtfully That may be it Because I am sure you were to be
there Barbara

BARBARA Our wedding Billy

KARL It doesnt explain those other people though

The Colonel moves about in agitation

BARBARA What is it dear

COLONEL I cant quite remember but I think that is why she didnt
take me It is your wedding Barbara but I dont think Billy boy is to
be there my love

BARBARA Not at my wedding

BILLY Grandfather

COLONEL Theres something sad about it

BARBARA There cant be anything sad about a wedding dear Granny
didnt say it was a sad wedding did she

COLONEL She was smiling

BARBARA Of course she was

COLONEL But I think that was only to please the nurse

BARBARA That nurse again Dear dont think any more about it Theres
no wedding

COLONEL gently though he wonders why they can go on deceiving him Is
there not

The village wedding bells begin to ring

The Colonel is triumphant I told you There is a wedding

The bells ring on gaily Billy and Barbara take a step nearer to each
other but can go no closer The bells ring on and the three young
people fade from the scene

When they are gone and he is alone the Colonel still addresses them
Its Barbaras wedding Billy boy why are you not at Barbaras
wedding

Soon the bells stop He knows that he is alone now but he does not
understand it The sun is shining brightly but he sits very cold in his
chair He shivers He is very glad to see his wife coming to him
through the open window She is a dear old lady and is dressed
brightly as becomes one who has been to a wedding Her face beams to
match her gown She is really quite a happy woman again for it is
several years since any deep sorrow struck her and that is a long time
No one you know understands the Colonel as she does no one can soothe
him and bring him out of his imaginings as she can He hastens to her
He is no longer cold That is her great reward for all she does for him

I have come back John she says smiling tranquilly on him It
hasnt seemed very long has it

No not long Ellen Had you a nice walk

She continues to smile but she is watching him closely I havent been
for a walk Dont you remember where I told you I was going John

Yes it was to a wedding

Rather tremulously You havent forgotten whose wedding have you

Tell me Ellen He is no longer troubled He knows that Ellen will
tell him

I have been seeing Barbara married John

Yes it was Barbaras wedding They wouldntEllen why wasnt I
there

Like one telling him amusing gossip I thought you might be a little
troubled if you went John Sometimes your mindnot often but
sometimes if you are agitatedand then you think you seepeople who
arent here any longer Oh dear oh dear help me with these bonnet
strings

Yes I know Im all right when you are with me Ellen Funny isnt
it

She raises her shoulders in a laugh It is funny John I ran
back to you John I was thinking of you all the timeeven more than
of Billy boy

The Colonel is very gay Tell me all about it Ellen Did Billy boy
lose the ring We always said he would lose the ring

She looks straight into his eyes You have forgotten again John
Barbara isnt married to Billy boy

He draws himself up Not marry Billy Ill see about that

She presses him into his chair Sit down dear and Ill tell you
something again It is nothing to trouble you because your soldiering
is done John and greatly done My dear there is war again and our
old land is in it Such a war as my soldier never knew

He rises He is a stern old man A war Thats it is it So now I
know Why wasnt I told Why havent I my marching orders Im not too
old yet

Yes John you are too old and all you can do now is to sit here
andand take care of me You knew all about it quite clearly this
morning We stood together upstairs by the window listening to the
aircraft guns

I remember I thought it was a thunderstorm Dering told me he heard
nothing

Dering

Our gardener you know His voice becomes husky Havent I been
talking with him Ellen

It is a long time since we had a gardener John

Is it So it is A war That is why there is no more cricket on the
green

They have all gone to the war John

Thats it even the little shavers He whispers Why isnt Billy boy
fighting Ellen

Oh John

Is Billy boy dead She nods Was he killed in action Tell me tell
me She nods again Good for Billy boy I knew Billy boy was all
right Dont cry Ellen Ill take care of you Alls well with Billy
boy

Yes I know John

He hesitates before speaking again Ellen who is the soldier He comes
here He is a captain

He is a very gallant man John It is he who was married to Barbara
today

Bitterly She has soon forgotten

His wife shakes her brave head She hasnt forgotten dear And its
nearly three years now since Billy died

So long We have a medal he got havent we

No John he died before he could win any medals

The Colonel moves about Karl will be sorry They were very fond of
each other those two boys Ellen

Karl fought against us John He died in the same engagement They may
even have killed each other

They hadnt known Ellen

She with thin lips I daresay they knew

Billy boy and Karl

She tells him some more gossip John I had Barbara married from here
because she has no people of her own I think Billy would have liked
it

That was the thing to do Ellen Nice of you I remember everything
now Its Dering she has married He was once my gardener

The world is all being remade dear He is worthy of her

He lets this pass He has remembered something almost as surprising
Ellen is Barbara a nurse

Yes John and one of the staidest and most serene Who would have
thought it of the merry madcap of other days They are coming here
John to say goodbye to you They have only a few days leave She is
in France too you know She was married in her nurses uniform

Was she She told me today thatno it couldnt have been today

You have been fancying you saw them I suppose She grows tremulous
again You will be nice to them John wont you and wish them luck
They have their trials before them

He says eagerly Tell me what to do Ellen

Dont say anything about Billy boy John

No no lets pretend

And I wouldnt talk about the garden John just in case he is a little
touchy about that

The Colonel is beginning to fancy himself as a tactician Not a word

She knows what is the way to put him on his mettle You see Im sure
I would make a mess of it so Im trusting to you John

He is very pleased Leave it all to me Ellen Ill be frightfully sly
You just watch me

She goes to the window and calls to the married couple Captain Dering
in khaki is a fine soldierly figure Barbara in her Red Gross uniform
is quiet and resourceful An artful old boy greets them
Congratulations Barbara No no none of your handshaking you dont
get past an old soldier in that way Excuse me young man He kisses
Barbara and looks at his wife to make sure that she is admiring him
And to you Captain Deringyou have won a prize

A gallant gentleman answers I know it Ill try to show I know it

The Colonel is perturbed I havent given Barbara a wedding present
Ellen I should like

Barbara breaks in Indeed you have dear and a lovely one You havent
forgotten

Granny signs to the Colonel and he immediately says with remarkable
cunning Ohthat I was just quizzing you Barbara I hope you will be
as happy dear staid Barbara as if you had married He sees that
he has nearly given away the situation He looks triumphantly at granny
as much as to say Observe me Im not going to say a word about him

Granny comes to his aid Perhaps Captain Dering has some little things
to do and you too Barbara They are leaving in an hour John

For a moment the Colonel is again in danger If you would like to take
Barbara into the garden Captain Dering He recovers himself
instantly No not the garden you wouldnt know your way about in the
garden

Wouldnt I Colonel the Captain says smiling

The answer is quite decisive No certainly not Ill show it you some
day

He makes gleeful signs to granny But there is a nice meadow just
beyond the shrubbery Barbara knows the way she often went there
with He checks himself Granny signs to them to go and Barbara
kisses both the Colonels hands The Captain will be jealous you
know he says twinkling

Let me dear says Barbara arranging his cushions professionally

Granny nods She is much better at it than I am now John

The Colonel has one last piece of advice to give I wouldnt go
down by the stream Barbaranot to the pool where the alder is
Therestheres not a good view there sir and a boya boy I knew
he oftennobody in particularjust a boy who used to come about the
househe is not here nowhe is on duty I dont think you should go
to the alder pool Barbara

We wont go there dear She and her husband go out and the Colonel
scarcely misses them he is so eager to hear what his wife thinks of
him

Did I do all right Ellen

Splendidly I was proud of you

He exults I put them completely off the scent They havent a notion
I can be very sly you know at times Ellen I think I should like to
have that alder tree cut down There is no boy now you see

I would leave it alone John There will be boys again Shall I read to
you you like that dont you

Yes read to mesomething funny if you please About Sam Weller No
I expect Sam has gone to the wars Read about Mr Pickwick He is very
amusing I feel sure that if he had tried to catch the bulltrout he
would have fallen in Just as Barbara did this morning

Barbara

She is down at the alder pool Billy is there with that nice German
boy The noise they make shouting and laughing

She gets from its shelf the best book for wartime Which bit shall I
read

About Mr Pickwick going into the ladys bedroom by mistake

Yes dear though you almost know it by heart You see you have begun
to laugh already

You are laughing too Ellen I cant help it

She begins to read they are both chuckling






A WELLREMEMBERED VOICE


Out of the darkness comes the voice of a woman speaking to her dead son

But that was against your wish was it not Was that against your wish
Would you prefer me not to ask that question

The room is so dark that we cannot see her All we know is that she is
one of four shapes gathered round a small table Beyond the darkness is
a great inglenook in which is seated on a settle a man of fifty Him
we can discern fitfully by the light of the fire It is not sufficiently
bright to enable him to read but an evening paper lies on his knee He
seems wistful and meek He is paying no attention to the party round the
table When he hears their voices it is only as empty sounds

The mother continues Perhaps I am putting the question in the wrong
way Are you not able to tell us any more

A mans voice breaks in There was a distinct movement that time but
it is so irregular

I thought so but please dont talk Do you want to tell us more Is it
that you cant hear me distinctly He seems to want to tell us more but
something prevents him

In any case Mrs Don it is extraordinary This is the first seance I
have ever taken part in but I must believe now

Of course Major these are the simplest manifestations They are only
the first step But if we are to go on the less we talk the better
Shall we go on It is not agitating you too much Laura

A girl answers There was a moment when Ibut I wish I was braver I
think it is partly the darkness I suppose we cant have a little
light

Certainly we can dear Darkness is quite unnecessary but I think it
helps one to concentrate

The Major lights a lamp and though it casts shadows we see now that the
room is an artists studio The silent figure in the inglenook is the
artist Mrs Don is his wife the two men are Major Armitage and an
older friend Mr Rogers The girl is Laura Bell These four are sitting
round the table their hands touching they are endeavouring to commune
with one who has crossed the gulf

The Major and Mr Rogers are but passing shadows in the play and even
nice Laura is only to flit across its few pages for a moment on her way
to happier things We scarcely notice them in the presence of Mrs Don
the gracious the beautiful the sympathetic whose magnetic force and
charm are such that we wish to sit at her feet at once She is
intellectual but with a disarming smile religious but so charitable
masterful and yet loved of all None is perfect and there must be a
flaw in her somewhere but to find it would necessitate such a rummage
among her many adornments as there is now no time for Perhaps we may
come upon it accidentally in the course of the play

She is younger than Mr Don who despite her efforts for many years to
cover his deficiencies is a man of no great account in a household
where the bigger personality of his wife swallows him like an Aarons
rod Mr Dons deficiencies She used to try very hard or fairly hard
to conceal them from Dick but Dick knew His mother was his chum All
the lovely things which happened in that house in the days when Dick was
alive were between him and her those two shut the door softly on old
Don always anxious not to hurt his feelings and then ran into each
others arms

In the better light Mr Don is now able to read his paper if he chooses
If he has forgotten the party at the table they have equally forgotten
him

MRS DON You have not gone away have you We must be patient Are you
still there

ROGERS I think I felt a movement

MRS DON Dont talk please Are you still there

The table moves

Yes It is your mother who is speaking do you understand that

The table moves

Yes What shall I ask him now

ROGERS We leave it to you Mrs Don

MRS DON Have you any message you want to send us Yes Is it
important Yes Are we to spell it out in the usual way Yes Is the
first letter of the first word A Is it B

She continues through the alphabet to L when the table responds
Similarly she finds that the second letter is O

Is the word Love Yes But I dont understand that movement You
are not displeased with us are you No Does the second word begin with
Awith B Yes

The second word is spelt out Bade and the third Me

Love Bade MeIf it is a quotation I believe I know it Is the
fourth word Welcome Yes

LAURA Love Bade Me Welcome

MRS DON That movement again Dont you want me to go on

LAURA Let us stop

MRS DON Not unless he wishes it Why are those words so important
Does the message end there Is any one working against you Some one
antagonistic Yes Not one of ourselves surely No Is it any one we
know Yes Can I get the name in the usual way Yes Is the first letter
of this persons name AB

It proves to be F One begins to notice a quaint peculiarity of Mrs
Dons She is so accustomed to homage that she expects a prompt response
even from the shades

Is the second letter A

The table moves

FA Fa

She is suddenly enlightened

Is the word Father Yes

They all turn and look for the first time at Mr Don He has heard and
rises apologetically

MR DON distressed I had no intentionShould I go away Grace

She answers sweetly without a trace of the annoyance she must surely
feel

MRS DON Perhaps you had better Robert

ROGERS I suppose it is because he is an unbeliever He is not openly
antagonistic is he

MRS DON sadly enough I am afraid he is They tend to discuss the
criminal as if he was not present

MAJOR But he must admit that we do get messages

MRS DON reluctantly He says we think we do He says they would not
want to communicate with us if they had such trivial things to say

ROGERS But we are only on the threshold Don This is just a
beginning

LAURA Didnt you hear Mr DonLove Bade Me Welcome

MR DON Does that strike you as important Laura

LAURA He said it was

MRS DON It might be very important to him though we dont understand
why

She speaks gently but there is an obstinacy in him despite his
meekness

MR DON I didnt mean to be antagonistic Grace I thought I wasnt
thinking of it at all

MRS DON Not thinking of Dick Robert And it was only five months
ago

MR DON who is somehow without meaning it always in the wrong
Ill go

ROGERS A boy wouldnt turn his father out Ask him

MR DON forlornly As to thatas to that

MRS DON I will ask him if you wish me to Robert

MR DON No dont

ROGERS It cant worry you as you are a disbeliever

MR DON No butI shouldnt like you to think that he sent me away

ROGERS He wont Will he Mrs Don

MR DON knowing what her silence implies You see Dick and I were not
veryno quarrel or anything of that sortbut I I didnt much matter
to Dick Im too old perhaps

MRS DON gently I wont ask him Robert if you would prefer me
not to

MR DON Ill go

MRS DON Im afraid it is too late now She turns away from earthly
things Do you want me to break off

The table moves

Yes Do you send me your love Dick Yes And to Laura Yes She
raises her eyes to Don and hesitates Shall I ask him

MR DON No no dont

ROGERS It would be all right Don

MR DON I dont know

They leave the table

LAURA a little agitated May I go to my room Mrs Don I feel
Ishould like to be alone

MRS DON Yes yes Laura dear I shall come in and see you

Laura bids them goodnight and goes She likes Mr Don she strokes his
hand when he holds it out to her but she cant help saying Oh Mr
Don how could you

ROGERS I think we must all want to be alone after such an evening
I shall say goodnight Mrs Don

MAJOR Same here I go your way Rogers but you will find me a silent
companion One doesnt want to talk ordinary things tonight Rather
not Thanks awfully

ROGERS Goodnight Don Its a pity you know a bit hard on your
wife

MR DON Goodnight Rogers Goodnight Major

The husband and wife left together have not much to say to each other
He is depressed because he has spoilt things for her She is not angry
She knows that he cant help being as he is and that there are fine
spaces in her mind where his thoughts can never walk with her But she
would forgive him seventy times seven because he is her husband She is
standing looking at a case of fishingrods against the wall There is
a Jock Scott still sticking in one of them Mr Don says as if somehow
they were evidence against him

Dicks fishingrods

She says forgivingly I hope you dont mind my keeping them in the
studio Robert They are sacred things to me

Thats all right Grace

I think I shall go to Laura now

Yes in his inexpressive way

Poor child

Im afraid I hurt her

Dick wouldnt have liked itbut Dicks gone She looks a little
wonderingly at him After all these years she can sometimes wonder
a little still I suppose you will resume your evening paper

He answers quietly but with the noble doggedness which is the reason
why we write this chapter in his life Why not Grace

She considers for she is so sure that she must know the answer better
than he I suppose it is just that a son is so much more to a mother
than to a father

I daresay

A little gust of passion shakes her How you can read about the war
nowadays

He says firmly to herhe has had to say it a good many times to
himself Im not going to give in But he adds I am so sorry I was
in the way Grace I wasnt scouting you or anything of that sort Its
just that I cant believe in it

Ah Robert you would believe if Dick had been to you what he was
to me

I dont know

In a sense you may be glad that you dont miss him in the way I do

Yes perhaps

Goodnight Robert

Goodnight dear

He is alone now He stands fingering the fishingrods tenderly then
wanders back into the inglenook In the room we could scarcely see him
for it has gone slowly dark there a grey darkness as if the lamp
though still burning was becoming unable to shed light Through the
greyness we see him very well beyond it in the glow of the fire He sits
on the settle and tries to read his paper He breaks down He is a
pitiful lonely man

In the silence something happens A wellremembered voice says
Father Mr Don looks into the greyness from which this voice comes
and he sees his son We see no one but we are to understand that to
Mr Don Dick is standing there in his habit as he lived He goes to his
boy

Dick

I have come to sit with you for a bit father

It is the gay young careless voice

Its you Dick its you

Its me all right father I say dont be startled or anything of that
kind We dont like that

My boy

Evidently Dick is the taller for Mr Don has to look up to him He puts
his hands on the boys shoulders

How am I looking father

You havent altered Dick

Rather not Its jolly to see the old studio again In a cajoling
voice I say father dont fuss Let us be our ordinary selves wont
you

Ill try Ill try You didnt say you had come to sit with me
Dick Not with me

Rather

But your mother

Its you I want

Me

We can only come to one you see

Then why me

Thats the reason He is evidently moving about looking curiously at
old acquaintances Hello heres your old jacket greasier than ever

Me But Dick it is as if you had forgotten It was your mother who
was everything to you It cant be you if you have forgotten that
I used to feel so out of it but of course you didnt know

I didnt know it till lately father but heaps of things that I didnt
know once are clear to me now I didnt know that you were the one who
would miss me most but I know now

Though the voice is as boyish as ever there is a new note in it of
which his father is aware Dick may not have grown much wiser but
whatever he does know now he seems to know for certain

Me miss you most Dick I try to paint just as before I go to the
club Dick I have been to a dinnerparty I said I wouldnt give in

We like that

But my boy

Mr Dons arms have gone out to him again Dick evidently wriggles away
from them He speaks coaxingly

I say father lets get away from that sort of thing

That is so like you Dick Ill do anything you ask

Then keep a bright face

Ive tried to

Good man I say put on your old greasy you are looking so beastly
clean

The old greasy is the jacket and Mr Don obediently gets into it

Anything you like No thats the wrong sleeve Thanks Dick

They are in the inglenook now and the mischievous boy catches his
father by the shoulders

Here let me shove you into your old seat

Mr Don is propelled on to the settle

Hows that umpire

Dick smiling thats just how you used to butt me into it long ago

Dick is probably standing with his back to the fire chuckling

When I was a kid

With the palette in my hand

Or sticking to your trousers

The mess we made of ourselves Dick

I sneaked behind the settle and climbed up it

Till you fell off

On top of you and the palette

It is good fun for a father and son and the crafty boy has succeeded
in making the father laugh But soon

Ah Dick

The son frowns He is not going to stand any nonsense

Now then behave What did I say about that face

Mr Don smiles at once obediently

Thats better Ill sit here

We see from his fathers face which is smiling with difficulty that Dick
has plopped into the big chair on the other side of the inglenook His
legs are probably dangling over one of its arms

Rather sharply Got your pipe

I dontI dont seem to care to smoke nowadays Dick

Rot Just because I am dead You that pretend to be plucky I wont
have it you know You get your pipe and look slippy about it

Yes Dick the old man says obediently He fills his pipe from a jar
on the mantelshelf We may be sure that Dick is watching closely to see
that he lights it properly

Now then burn your thumb with the matchyou always did you know
Thats the style Youve forgotten to cock your head to the side Not so
bad Thats you Like it

Its rather nice Dick Dick you and me by the fire

Yes but sit still How often we might have been like this father
and werent

Ah

Face How is Fido

Never a dog missed her master more

Oh frowning She doesnt want to go and sit on my grave or any of
that tosh does she As if I were there

No no hastily she goes ratting Dick

Good old Fido

Dick heres a good one We oughtnt to keep a dog at all because we
are on rations now but what do you think Fido ate yesterday

Let me guess The joint

Almost worse than that She ate all the cooks meat tickets

They laugh together but when Dick says lightheartedly That dog will
be the death of me his father shivers Dick does not notice this his
eyes have drawn him to the fishingrods

Hullo

Yes those are your old fishingrods

Heres the little hickory Do you remember father how I got the
sevenpounder on a burntrout cast No you werent there That was
a day It was really only six and threequarters I put a stone in
its mouth the second time we weighed it

You loved fishing Dick

Didnt I Why werent you oftener with me Ill tell you a funny thing
When I went a soldiering I used to prayjust standing up you
knowthat I shouldnt lose my right arm because it would be so awkward
for casting He cogitates as he returns to the inglenook Somehow I
never thought I should be killed Lots of fellows thought that about
themselves but I never did It was quite a surprise to me

Oh Dick

Whats the matter Oh I forgot Face He is apparently looking down
at his father wonderingly Havent you got over it yet father I got
over it so long ago I wish you people would understand what a little
thing it is

Tell me very humbly tell me Dick

All right He is in the chair again

Mind I cant tell you where I was killed its against the
regulations

I know where

Curiously You got a wire I suppose

Yes

Theres always a wire for officers even for nd Lieutenants Its
jolly decent of them

Tell me Dick about thethe veil I mean the veil that is drawn
between the living and the

The dead Funny how you jib at that word

I suppose the veil is like a mist

The veils a rummy thing father Yes like a mist But when one has
been at the Front for a bit you cant think how thin the veil seems to
get just one layer of it I suppose it seems thin to you out there
because one step takes you through it We sometimes mix up those who
have gone through with those who havent I daresay if I were to go back
to my old battalion the living chaps would just nod to me

Dick

Wheres that pipe Death Well to me before my day came it was like
some part of the line I had heard a lot about but never been in I mean
never been in to stay because of course one often popped in and out

Dick the day that you

My day I dont remember being hit you know I dont remember anything
till the quietness came When you have been killed it suddenly becomes
very quiet quieter even than you have ever known it at home Sunday
used to be a pretty quiet day at my tutors when Trotter and I
flattened out on the first shady spot up the river but it is quieter
than that I am not boring you am I

My boy

When I came to the veil was so thin that I couldnt see it at all and
my first thought was Which side of it have I come out on The living
ones lying on the ground were asking that about themselves too There
we were all sitting up and asking whether we were alive or dead and
some were one and some were the other Sort of fluke you know

IIoh Dick

As soon as each had found out about himself he wondered how it had gone
with his chums I hallood to Johnny Randall and he hallood back that
he was dead but that Trotter was living Thats the way of it A good
deal of chaff of course By that time the veil was there and getting
thicker and we lined up on our right sides Then I could only see the
living ones in shadow and hear their voices from a distance They sang
out to us for a while but just at first father it was rather lonely
when we couldnt hear their tread any longer What are you fidgeting
about You neednt worry that didnt last long we were heaps more
interested in ourselves than in them You should have heard the
gabbling It was all so frightfully novel you see and no one quite
knew what to do next whether all to start off together or wait for
some one to come for us I say what a lot Im talking

What happened Dick

Oh a proud ring coming into the voice Ockley came for us He used
to be alive you knowthe Ockley who was keeper of the fives in my
first half I once pointed him out to mother I was jolly glad he was
the one who came for us As soon as I saw it was Ockley I knew we should
be all right

Dick I like that Ockley

Rather I wish I could remember something funny to tell you though
There are lots of jokes but I am such a one for forgetting them

He laughs boisterously We may be sure that he flings back his head You
remember how Dick used to fling back his head when he laughedNo you
didnt know him

Father do you remember little Wantage who was at my private and came
on to Ridleys house in my third half His mother was the one you called
Emily

Emily Wantages boy

Thats the card We used to call him Jemima because he and his mother
were both caught crying when lockup struck and she had to clear out

She was very fond of him Dick

Oh I expect no end Tell her hes killed

She knows

She had got a wire That isnt the joke though You see he got into a
hopeless muddle about which side of the veil he had come out on and he
went off with the other ones and they wouldnt have him and he got
lost in the veil running up and down it calling to us and just for
the lark we didnt answer He chuckles I expect he has become a
ghost With sudden consideration Best not tell his mother that

Mr Don rises wincing and Dick also is at once on his feet full of
compunction

Was that shabby of me Sorry father We are all pretty young you
know and we cant help having our fun still

Im glad you still have your fun the father says once more putting
his hands on Dicks shoulders Let me look at you again Dick There is
such a serenity about you now

Serenity thats the word None of us could remember what the word was
Its a ripping good thing to have I should be awfully bucked if you
would have it too

Ill try

I say how my tongue runs on But after all it was my show Now you
tell me some things

What about Dick The war

No almost in a shout We have a fine for speaking about the war And
you know those fellows we were fightingI forget who they were

The Germans

Oh yes Some of them were on the same side of the veil with us and
they were rather decent so we chummed up in the end and Ockley took us
all away together They were jolly lucky in getting Ockley There I go
again Come on its your turn Has the bathroom tap been mended yet

Im afraid it isjust tied up with that string still Dick It works
all right

It only needs two screwnails you know

Ill see to it

Do you know whether any one at my tutors got his fives choice this
half

Im sorry Dick but

Or who is the captain of the boats

No I

Whatever have you been doing He is moving about the room Hullo
heres mothers workbox Is mother all right

Very sad about you Dick

Oh I say that isnt fair Why doesnt she cheer up

It isnt so easy my boy

Its pretty hard lines on me you know

How is that

If you are sad I have to be sad Thats how we have got to work it
off You cant think how we want to be bright

Ill always remember that and Ill tell your mother Ah but she wont
believe me Dick you will have to tell her yourself

I cant do that father I can only come to one

She should have been the one she loved you best Dick

Oh I dont know Do you ever with a slight hesitation see Laura
now

She is staying with us at present

Is she I think I should like to see her

If Laura were to see you

Oh she wouldnt see me She is not dressed in black is she

No in white

Good girl I suppose mother is in black

Surely Dick

Its too bad you know

You werent exactlyengaged to Laura were you Dick A bold question
from a father but the circumstances were unusual Apologetically I
never rightly knew

No Dick has flung back his head again Confidentially Father I
sometimes thought of it but it rather scared me I expect that is about
how it was with her too

She is very broken about you now

Irritated Oh hang

Would you like her to forget you Dick

Rather not But she might help a fellow a bit Hullo

What calls forth this exclamation is the little table at which the
seance had taken place The four chairs are still standing round it as
if they were guarding something

Heres something new father this table

Yes It is usually in the drawingroom

Of course I remember

Mr Don sets his teeth Does that table suggest anything to you Dick

To me Let me think Yes I used to play backgammon on it What is it
doing here

Your mother brought it in

To play games on Mother

I dontknow that it was a game Dick

But to play anything Im precious glad she can do that Was Laura
playing with her

She was helping her

Good for Laura He is looking at some slips of paper on the table
Are those pieces of paper used in the game There is writing on them
The first letter is Hthe second letter is Athe third letter is R
What does it mean

Does it convey no meaning to you Dick

To me No why should it

Mr Don is enjoying no triumph Let us go back to the fire my boy

Dick follows him into the inglenook But why should it convey a
meaning to me I was never much of a hand at indoor games Brightly
I bet you Ockley would be good at it After a joyous ramble Ockleys
nickname still sticks to him

I dont think I know it

He was a frightful swell you know Keeper of the field and played
against Harrow the same year I suppose it did go just a little to his
head

They are back in their old seats and Mr Don leans forward in gleeful
anticipation Probably Dick is leaning forward in the same way and this
old father is merely copying him

What did you nickname him Dick

It was his fags that did it

I should like to know it I say do tell me Dick

He is pretty touchy about it now you know

I wont tell any one Come on Dick

His fags called him KCMG

Meaning meaning Dick

Meaning Kindly Call Me God

Mr Don flings back his head so we know what Dick is doing They are
a hilarious pair perhaps too noisy for suddenly Mr Don looks at the
door

I think I heard some one Dick

Perhaps its mother

She may nervously have heard the row

Dicks eyes must be twinkling I say father youll catch it

I cant believe Dick gazing wistfully into the chair that she
wont see you

It is a sadder voice than his own for the moment that answers Only one
may see me

You will speak to her Dick Let her hear your voice

Only one may hear me I could make her the one but it would mean your
losing me

I cant give you up Dick

Mrs Don comes in as beautiful as ever but a little aggrieved

I called to you Robert

Yes I thoughtI was just going to

He has come from the inglenook to meet her He looks from her to Dick
whom he sees so clearly standing now by the fire An awe falls upon Mr
Don He says her name meaning See Grace who is with us

Her eyes follow his but she sees nothing not even two arms
outstretched to her What is it Robert What is the matter

She does not hear a voice say Mother

I heard you laughing Robert what on earth at

The father cannot speak

Now youre in a hole father says a mischievous voice

Can I not be told Robert

Something in the paper the voice whispers

Mr Don lifts the paper feebly and his wife understands Oh a
newspaper joke Please I dont want to hear it

Was it my laughing that brought you back Grace

No that would only have made me shut my door If Dick thought you
could laugh She goes to the little table I came back for these
slips of paper She lifts them and presses them to her breast These
precious slips of paper

Dick was always a curious boy and forgetting that she cannot hear him
he blurts out How do you mean mother Why are they precious

Mr Don forgets also and looks to her for an answer

What is it Robert

Didnt youhear anything Grace

No Perhaps Laura was calling I left her on the stair

I wish Mr Don is fighting for Dick now I wish Laura would come
back and say goodnight to me

I daresay she will

And valiantly if she could berather brighter Grace

Robert

I think Dick would like it

Her fine eyes reproach him mutely but she says ever forgiving Is
that how you look at it Robert Very well laugh your fillif you can
But if Dick were to appear before me tonight

In his distress Mr Don cries aloud to the figure by the fire Dick if
you can appear to your mother do it

There is a pause in which anything may happen but nothing happens
Yes something happened Dick has stuck to his father

Really Robert Mrs Don says and without a word of reproach she
goes away Evidently Dick comes to his father who has sank into a chair
and puts a loving hand on him Mr Don clasps it without looking up

Father that was tophole of you Poor mother I should have liked to
hug her but I cant

You should have gone to her Dick you shouldnt have minded me

The wiser boy says Mothers a darling but she doesnt need me as much
as you do

I dont know

Thats all right Im glad shes so keen about that game though

He has returned to the inglenook when Laura comes in eager to make
amends to Dicks father if she hurt him when she went out

Softly I have come to say goodnight Mr Don

Its nice of you Laura taking both her hands

Dick speaks I want her to come nearer to the fire I cant see her
very well there

For a moment Mr Don is caught out again but Laura has heard nothing
He becomes quite cunning in Dicks interests

Your hands are cold Laura go over to the fire I want to look at
you

She sits on the hearthstone by Dicks feet

Shyly Am I all right

It is Dick who answers Youre awfully pretty Laura You are even
prettier than I thought I remember I used to think she cant be quite
as pretty as I think her and then when you came you were just a little
prettier

She has been warming her hands Why dont you say anything she asks
Mr Don

I was thinking of you and Dick Laura

What a pretty soul she has father says the boy I can see right
down into it now

If Dick had lived Laura do you think that you and he

With shining eyes I thinkif he had wanted it very much

I expect he would my dear

There is an odd candour about Dicks contribution I think so too but
I never was quite sure They are a very young pair

Laura is trembling a little Mr Don

Yes Laura

I think there is something wicked about me I sometimes feel quite
lightheartedthough Dick has gone

Perhaps nowadays the fruit trees have that sort of shame when they
blossom Laura but they cant help doing it I hope you are yet to be
a happy woman a happy wife

It seems so heartless to Dick

Not a bit its what I should like Dick says

Its what he would like Laura

Do you remember Laura Dick goes on I kissed you once It was under
a lilac in the Loudon Woods I knew at the time that you were angry and
I should have apologised Im sorry Laura

His sweetheart has risen tasting something bittersweet What is it
Laura Mr Don asks

SomehowI dont know howbut for a moment I seemed to feel the smell
of lilac Dick was oncenice to me under a lilac Oh Mr Don She
goes to him like a child and he soothes and pets her

There there That will be all right quite all right He takes her to
the door Goodnight my dear

Goodnight Mr Don

Goodbye Laura says the third voice

Mr Don is looking so glum that the moment they are alone Dick has to
cry warningly Face He is probably looking glum himself for he says
candidly Pretty awful things these partings Father dont feel hurt
though I dodge the goodbye business when I leave you

Thats so like you Dick

Ill have to go soon

Oh Dick Cant you

Theres something I want not to miss you see

Im glad of that

Im not going yet but I mean that when I do Ill just slip away

What I am afraid of is that you wont come back

I willhonest Injunif you keep bright

But if I do that Dick you might think I wasnt missing you so much

We know better than that You see if youre bright Ill get a good
mark for it

how interested I am in your future

Mr Don hesitates

Some fear seems to come into the boys voice Dont ask it father

I shall go on worrying about it if I dontbut just as you like
Dick

Go ahead father ask me

After a pause the boy says Not always

What is the great difference Dick

Well down here one knows he has risks to run

And you miss that

password His voice grows troubled Its awfully difficult to get the
password

Is there anything in it

Mr Don is not speaking to his son He goes to the little table and
looks long at it Has it taken on a sinister aspect Those chairs are
they guarding a secret

He turns to find that Dick has gone
