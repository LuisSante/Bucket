PREFACE


In this volume I have given exclusively the views of Russian critics
upon their literature and hereby acknowledge my entire indebtedness to
them

The limits of the work and the lack of general knowledge on the
subject rendered it impossible for me to attempt any comparisons with
foreign literatures

RUSSIAN LITERATURE


CHAPTER I

THE ANCIENT PERIOD FROM THE EARLIEST TIMES TO THE INTRODUCTION OF
CHRISTIANITY IN 


Whether Russia had any literature or even a distinctive alphabet
previous to the end of the tenth century is not known

In the year  Vladmir Grand Prince of Keff accepted
Christianity for himself and his nation from Byzantium and baptized
Russia wholesale Hence his characteristic title in history
PrinceSaintequaltotheApostles His grandmother Olga had already
been converted to the Greek Church late in life and had established
churches and priests in Keff it is said Prince Vladmir could have
been baptized at home but he preferred to make the Greek form of
Christianity his state religion in a more decided manner to adopt the
gospel of peace to an accompaniment of martial deeds Accordingly he
compelled the Emperors of Byzantium by force to send the Patriarch of
Constantinople to baptize him and their sister to become his wife He
then ordered his subjects to present themselves forthwith for baptism
Finding that their idols did not punish Vladmir for destroying them
and that even great Pern the Thunderer did not resent being flung into
the Dnipr the people quietly and promptly obeyed As their old
religion had no temples for them to cling to and nothing approaching a
priestly class except the volkhve or wizards to encourage them in
opposition the nation became Christian in a day to all appearances We
shall see however that in many cases as in other lands converted from
heathendom the old gods were merely baptized with new names in company
with their worshipers

Together with the religion which he imported from Byzantium
PrinceSaint Vladmir naturally imported also priests architects
artists for the holy pictures ikni as well as the traditional
style of painting them ecclesiastical vestments and vessels andmost
precious of allthe Slavonic translation of the holy Scriptures and of
the Church Service books These books however were not written in
Greek but in the tongue of a cognate Slavonic race which was
comprehensible to the Russians Thus were the first firm foundations of
Christianity education and literature simultaneously laid in the
cradle of the present vast Russian empire appropriately called Little
Russia of which Keff was the capital although even then they were
not confined to that section of the country but were promptly extended
by identical methods to old NvgorodLord Nvgorod the Great the
cradle of the dynasty of Rrik founder of the line of sovereign Russian
princes

Whence came these Slavonic translations of the Scriptures the Church
Services and other books and the preachers in the vernacular for the
infant Russian nation The books had been translated about one hundred
and twentyfive years previously for the benefit of a small Slavonic
tribe the Moravians This tribe had been baptized by German
ecclesiastics whose books and speech in the Latin tongue were wholly
incomprehensible to their converts For fifty years Latin had been used
and naturally Christianity had made but little progress Then the
Moravian Prince Rstislaff appealed to Michael emperor of Byzantium to
send him preachers capable of making themselves understood The emperor
had in his dominions many Slavonians hence the application on the
assumption that there must be among the Greek priests many who were
acquainted with the languages of the Slavonic tribes In answer to this
appeal the Emperor Michael dispatched to Moravia two learned monks
Kyrll and Methdy together with several other ecclesiastics in the
year 

Kyrll and Methdy were the sons of a grandee who resided in the chief
town of Macedonia which was surrounded by Slavonic colonies The elder
brother Methdy had been a military man and the governor of a
province containing Slavonians The younger Kyrll had received a
brilliant education at the imperial court in company with the Emperor
Michael and had been a pupil of the celebrated Photius afterwards
Patriarch and librarian of St Sophia after becoming a monk Later
on the brothers had led the life of itinerant missionaries and had
devoted themselves to preaching the Gospel to Jews and Mohammedans Thus
they were in every way eminently qualified for their new task

The Slavonians in the Byzantine empire and the cognate tribes who dwelt
nearer the Danube like the Moravians had long been in sore need of a
Slavonic translation of the Scriptures and the Church books since they
understood neither Greek nor Latin and for the lack of such a
translation many relapsed into heathendom Kyrll first busied himself
with inventing an alphabet which should accurately reproduce all the
varied sounds of the Slavonic tongues Tradition asserts that he
accomplished this task in the year  founding it upon the Greek
alphabet appropriating from the Hebrew Armenian and Coptic characters
for the sounds which the Greek characters did not represent and
devising new ones for the nasal sounds The characters in this alphabet
were thirtyeight in number Kyrll with the aid of his brother
Methdy then proceeded to make his translations of the Church Service
books The Bulgarians became Christians in the year  and these books
were adopted by them But the greatest activity of the brothers was
during the four and a half years beginning with the year  when they
translated the holy Scriptures taught the Slavonians their new system
of reading and writing and struggled with heathendom and with the
German priests of the Roman Church These German ecclesiastics are said
to have sent petition after petition to Rome to Pope Nicholas I
demonstrating that the Word of God ought to be preached in three tongues
onlyHebrew Greek and Latinbecause the inscription on the Cross
had been written by Pilate in those tongues only Pope Nicholas
summoned the brothers to Rome but Pope Adrian II who was reigning in
his stead when they arrived there received them cordially granted them
permission to continue their preaching and divine services in the
Slavonic language and even consecrated Methdy bishop of Pannonia
after which Methdy returned to Moravia but Kyrll exhausted by his
labors withdrew to a monastery near Rome and died there in 

The language into which Kyrll and Methdy translated was probably the
vernacular of the Slavonian tribes dwelling between the Balkans and the
Danube But as the system invented by Kyrll took deepest root in
Bulgaria whither in  a year after Methdys death his disciples
were banished from Moravia the language preserved in the ancient
transcripts of the holy Scriptures came in time to be called Ancient
Bulgarian In this connection it must be noted that this does not
indicate the language of the Bulgarians but merely the language of the
Slavonians who lived in Bulgaria The Bulgarians themselves did not
belong to the Slavonic nor even to the IndoEuropean race but were of
UralAltaic extraction that is to say they belonged to the family now
represented in Europe by the Finns Turks Hungarians Tatars and
Samoyds In the seventh century this people which had inhabited the
country lying between the Volga and the Don in southeastern Russia
became divided one section moved northward and settled on the Kma
River a tributary of the Volga the other section moved westward and
made their appearance on the Danube at the close of the seventh
century There they subdued a considerable portion of the Slavonic
inhabitants being a warlike race but the Slavonians who were more
advanced in agriculture and more industrious than the Bulgarians
effected a peaceful conquest over the latter in the course of the two
succeeding centuries so that the Bulgarians abandoned their own
language and customs and became completely merged with the Slavonians
to whom they had given their name

When the Slavonic translations of the Scriptures and the Church Service
books were brought to Russia from Bulgaria and Byzantium the language
in which they were written received the name of Church Slavonic
because it differed materially from the Russian vernacular and was used
exclusively for the church services Moreover as in the early days of
Russian literature the majority of writers belonged to the
ecclesiastical class the literary or book language was gradually
evolved from a mixture of Church Slavonic and ancient Russian and in
this language all literature was written until the civil or secular
alphabet and language were introduced by Peter the Great at the
beginning of the eighteenth century Books were written in Kyrllian
characters until the sixteenth century and the first printed books
which date from that century were in the same characters The most
ancient manuscripts written previous to the fourteenth century are
very beautiful each letter being set separately and the capital
letters often assuming the form of fantastic beasts and birds or of
flowers or gilded The oldest manuscript of Russian work preserved
dates from the middle of the eleventh centurya magnificent parchment
copy of the Gospels made by Deacon Grigry for Ostromr the
burgomaster of Nvgorod  and hence known as the Ostromr
Gospels

But before we deal with the written and strictly speaking literary works
of Russia we must make acquaintance with the oral products of the
peoples genius which antedate it or at all events contain traces of
such hoary antiquity that history knows nothing definite concerning
them although they deserve precedence for their originality Such are
the skzki or tales the poetical folklore the epic songs the
religious ballads The fairy tales while possessing analogies with
those of other lands have their characteristic national features
While less striking and original than for example the exquisite
Esthonian legends they are of great interest in the study of
comparative folklore More important is the poetical folklore of
Russia concerning which neither tradition nor history can give us any
clue in the matter of derivation or date One thing seems reasonably
certain it largely consists of the relics of an extensive system of
sorcery in the form of fragmentary spells exorcisms incantations and
epic lays or bylny

Song accompanies every action of the Russian peasant from the cradle to
the grave the choral dances of spring summer and autumn the games of
the young people in their winter assemblies marriages funerals and
every phase of life the sowing and the harvest and so forth The kazk
songs robber songs soldiers songs and historical songs are all
descendants or imitators of the ancient poetry of Russia They are the
remains of the thirdthe Moscow or imperialcycle of the epic songs
which deals with really historical characters and events The Moscow
cycle is preceded by the cycles of Vladmir or Keff and of Nvgorod
Still more ancient must be the foundations of the marriage songs rooted
in the customs of the ancient Slavonians

The Slavonians do not remember the date of their arrival in Europe
Tradition says that they first dwelt after this arrival along the
Danube whence a hostile force compelled them to emigrate to the
northeast At last Nvgorod and Keff were built and the Russians the
descendants of these eastern Slavonians naturally inherited the
religion which must at one time like the language have been common to
all the Slavonic races This religion like that of all Aryan races
was founded on reverence paid to the forces of nature and to the spirits
of the dead Their gods and goddesses represented the forces of nature
Thus Ldo and Lda who are frequently mentioned in these ancient songs
are probably the sungod and the goddess of spring and of love
respectively Ldo also is mentioned as the god of marriage mirth
pleasure and general happiness to whom those about to marry offered
sacrifices and much the same is said of the goddess Lda Moreover in
the Russian folksongs ldo and lda are used respectively for
lover bridegroom husband and for mistress bride wife and lad in
Russian signifies peace union harmony Nestor the famous old Russian
chronicler he died in  states that in ancient heathen times
marriage customs varied somewhat among the various Slavonian tribes in
the vicinity of the Dnister but brides were always seized or
purchased This purchase of the bride is supposed to be represented in
the game and choral song khorovd called The Sowing of the
Millet The singers form two choirs which face each other and exchange
remarks The song belongs to the vernal rites hence the reference to
Ldo which is repeated after every lineDidLdo meaning in
Lithuanian Great Ldo

     First Chorus We have sown we have sown millet O DidLdo we
           have sown
     Second Chorus But we will trample it O DidLdo we will
           trample it
     First Chorus But wherewith will ye trample it
     Second Chorus Horses will we turn into it
     First Chorus But we will catch the horses
     Second Chorus Wherewith will ye catch them
     First Chorus With a silken rein
     Second Chorus But we will ransom the horses
     First Chorus Wherewith will ye ransom them
     Second Chorus We will give a hundred rubles
     First Chorus A thousand is not what we want
     Second Chorus What is it then that ye want
     First Chorus What we want is a maiden

Thereupon one of the girls of the second choir goes over to the first
both sides singing together Our band has lost and Our band has
gained The game ends when all the girls have gone over to one side

The funeral wails are also very ancient While at the present day a very
talented wailer improvises a new plaint which her associates take up
and perpetuate the ancient forms are generally used

    From the side of the East
    The wild winds have arisen
    With the roaring thunders
    And the lightnings fiery
    On my fathers grave
    A star hath fallen
    Hath fallen from heaven
    Split open O dart of the thunder
    Damp Mother Earth
    Fall thou apart O Mother Earth
    On all four sides
    Split open O coffin planks
    Unfold O white shroud
    Fall away O white hands
    From over the bold heart
    And become parted O ye sweet lips
    Turn thyself O mine own father
    Into a bright swiftwinged falcon
    Fly away to the blue sea to the Caspian Sea
    Wash off O mine own father
    From thy white face the mold
    Come flying O my father
    To thine own home to the lofty trem
    Listen O my father
    To our songs of sadness

The Christmas and NewYear carols offer additional illustrations of the
ancient heathen customs and mythic or ritual poetry The festival which
was almost universally celebrated at Christmastide in ancient heathen
times seems to have referred to the renewed life attributed to the sun
after the winter solstice The Christian church turned this festival so
far as possible into a celebration of the birth of Christ Among the
Slavonians this festival was called Kolyda and the suna female
deitywas supposed to array herself in holiday robes and headdress
when the gloom of the long nights began to yield to the cheerful lights
of the lengthening days to seat herself in her chariot and drive her
steeds briskly towards summer She like the festival was called
Kolyda and in some places the people used to dress up a maiden in
white and carry her about in a sledge from house to house while the
kolydki or carols were sung by the train of young people who
attended her and received presents in return One of the kolydki
runs as follows

    Kolyda Kolyda
    Kolyda has arrived
    On the Eve of the Nativity
    We went about we sought Holy Kolyda
    Through all the courts in all the alleys
    We found Kolyda in Peters Court
    Round Peters Court there is an iron fence
    In the midst of the Court there are three rooms
    In the first room is the bright Moon
    In the second room is the red Sun
    And in the third room are the many Stars

A Christian turn is given to many of them just as the Mermen bear a
special Biblical name in some places and are called Pharaohs for
like the seals on the coast of Iceland they are supposed to be the
remnants of Pharaohs host which was drowned in the Red Sea One of the
most prominent and interesting of these Christianized carols is the
Slva or Glory Song Extracts from it have been decoratively and most
appropriately used on the artistic programmes connected with the
coronation of the Emperor Nicholas II This Glory Song is used in the
following manner The young people assemble together to deduce omens
from the words that are sung while trinkets belonging to each person
present are drawn at random from a clothcovered bowl in which they
have been deposited This is the first song of the series

    Glory to God in Heaven Glory
    To our Lord on this earth Glory
    May our Lord never grow old Glory
    May his bright robes never be spoiled Glory
    May his good steeds never be worn out Glory
    May his trusty servants never falter Glory
    May the right throughout Russia Glory
    Be fairer than the bright sun Glory
    May the Tzars golden treasury Glory
    Be forever full to the brim Glory
    May the great rivers Glory
    Bear their renown to the sea Glory
    The little streams to the mill Glory
    But this song we sing to the Grain Glory
    To the Grain we sing the Grain we honor Glory
    For the old folks to enjoy Glory
    For the young folks to hear Glory

Another curious old song connected with the grain is sung at the
NewYear Boys go about from house to house scattering grain of
different sorts chiefly oats and singing

    In the forest in the pine forest
    There stood a pinetree
    Green and shaggy
    O Ovsn O Ovsn
    The Boyrs came
    Cut down the pine
    Sawed it into planks
    Built a bridge
    Covered it with cloth
    Fastened it with nails
    O Ovsn O Ovsn
    Who who will go
    Along that bridge
    Ovsn will go there
    And the NewYear
    O Ovsn O Ovsn

Ovsn whose name is derived from Ovs oats pronounced avys like
the Teutonic Sungod is supposed to ride a pig or a boar Hence
sacrifices of pigs trotters and other pork products were offered to
the gods at the NewYear and such dishes are still preferred in Russia
at that season It must be remembered that the NewYear fell on March
st in Russia until  then the civil NewYear was transferred to
September st and January st was instituted as the NewYear by Peter
the Great only in the year 

The highest stage of development reached by popular song is the heroic
eposthe rhythmic story of the deeds of national heroes either
historical or mythical In many countries these epics were committed to
writing at a very early date In western Europe this took place in the
Middle Ages and they are known to the modern world in that form only
their memory having completely died out among the people But Russia
presents the striking phenomenon of a country where epic song handed
down wholly by oral tradition for nearly a thousand years is not only
flourishing at the present day in certain districts but even extending
into fresh fields

It is only within the last sixty years that the Russians have become
generally aware that their country possesses this wonderfully rich
treasure of epic religious and ceremonial songs In some cases the
epic lay and the religious ballad are curiously combined as in The One
and Forty Pilgrims which is generally classed with the epic songs
however But while the singing of the epic songs is not a profession
the singing of the religious ballads is of a professional character and
is used as a means of livelihood by the kalyki perekhzhie
literally wandering cripples otherwise known as wandering
psalmsingers These stikh or religious ballads are even more
remarkable than the epic songs in some respects and practically nothing
concerning them is accessible in English

In all countries where the Roman Church reigned supreme in early times
it did its best to consign all popular religious poetry to oblivion But
about the seventeenth century it determined to turn such fragments as
had survived this procedure to its own profit Accordingly they were
written over in conformity with its particular tenets for the purpose
of inculcating its doctrines Both courses were equally fatal to the
preservation of anything truly national Incongruousness was the
inevitable result

The Greek or rather the RussoGreek Church adopted precisely the
opposite course it never interfered in the slightest degree with
popular poetry either secular or religious Christianity therefore
merely enlarged the field of subjects The result is that the Slavonic
peoples including even to some extent the Roman Catholic Poles
possess a mass of religious poetry the like of which either in kind or
in quantity is not to be found in all western Europe

It is well to note at this point that the word stikh derived from
an ancient Greek word is incorporated into the modern Russian word for
poetry stikhotvornieversemaking literally renderedand it has
now become plain that Lomonsoff the father of Russian Literature who
was the first secular Russian poet and polished the ancient tongue into
the beginning of the modern literary language about the middle of the
eighteenth century did not originate his versemeasures but derived
them from the common people the peasants whence he himself sprang
Modern Russian verse therefore is thus traced back directly in its
most national traits to these religious ballads It is impossible to
give any adequate account of them here and it is especially difficult
to convey an adequate idea of the genuine poetry and happy phrasing
which are often interwoven with absurdities approaching the grotesque

The ballads to which we shall briefly refer are full of illustrations of
the manner in which old pagan gods became Christian deities so to
speak of the newly baptized nation For example Pern the Thundergod
became in popular superstition St Ily or Elijah and the day
dedicated to him July th old style is called Ily the
Thunderbringer Elijahs fiery chariot the lightning rumbling across
the sky brings a thunderstorm on or very near that date and although
Perns name is forgotten in Russia proper he still remains under his
new title the patron of the husbandman as he was in heathen times In
the epic songs of the Vladmir cycle as well as in the semireligious
and religious ballads he figures as the strongest and most popular
hero under the name of Ily Mrometz Ily of Mrom the Old Kazk
and his characteristic feats as well as those attributed to his heroic
steed Cloudfall are supposed by the school of Russian writers who
regard all these poems as cosmic myths rather than as historical poems
to preserve the heros mythological significance as the Thundergod
Pern

He plays a similar part in the very numerous religious ballads on the
Last Judgment St Michael acts as the judge Some sinful souls commit
the gross error of attempting to bribe him whereupon Michael shouts
Ily the Prophet Anakh Take ye guns with great thunder Move ye the
Pharaoh mountains of stone Let me not hear from these sinners neither
a whine nor a whimper

In Lithuania the Thundergods ancient name is still extant in its
original form of Perkun the Virgin Mary is called Lady Mary
Perkunatele or The Mother of Thunder according to a Polish
tradition and in the Russian government of Vilna the d of February is
dedicated to AllHoly Mary the Thunderer It is evidently in this
character that she plays a part similar to that of St Michael and Ily
the Prophet combined as above mentioned in another ballad of the Last
Judgment She appears in this ballad to be the sole inhabitant of
heaven judge and executioner With her thundering voice she condemns
to outer darkness all who have not paid her proper respect promising to
bury them under damp mother earth and burning stones To the just
that is to those who have paid her due homage she says Come take
the thrones the golden crowns the imperishable robes which I have
prepared for you and if this seem little to you ye shall work your
will in heaven

St Yegry the Braveour St Georgepossesses many of the attributes
of Pern He is however a purely mythical character and the extremely
ancient religious poems relating to him present the most amusing mixture
of Christianity and Greek mythology as in the following example

In the year  the old Russian reckoning like the Jewish began with
the creation of the world the kingdoms of Sodom Komor Gomorrah and
Arabia met their doom Sodom dropped through the earth Komor was
destroyed by fire and Arabia was afflicted by a seamonster which
demanded a human victim every day This victim was selected by lot and
one day the lot fell upon the king but at the suggestion of the queen
who hated her daughter Elizabeth the Fair the girl was sent in his
place under the pretext that she was going to meet her bridegroom
Yegry the Brave comes to her assistance as Perseus did to the
assistance of Andromeda but lies down for a nap while awaiting the
arrival of the dragon The beast approaches Elizabeth dares not awaken
Yegry but a burning tear from her right eye arouses him He attacks
the dragon with his spear and his heroic steed which is sometimes a
white mule tramples on it after the fashion with which we are familiar
in art Then he binds Elizabeths sash which is five and forty ells in
length about the dragons jaws and bids the maiden have three
churches built in honor of her deliverance one to St Nicholas and the
Holy Trinity one to the AllHoly Birthgiver of God and one to Yegry
the Brave Elizabeth the Fair then returns to town leading the tamed
dragon by her sash to the terror of the inhabitants and to the disgust
of her mother The three churches are duly built and Christianity is
promptly adopted as the state religion of Arabia In another ballad
Yegry is imprisoned for thirty years in a pit under the ground because
he will not accept the LatinMussulman faith

Among the most ancient religious ballads properly speaking are The
Dove Book The Merciful Woman of Compassion or The Alleluia
Woman The Wanderings of the AllHoly Birthgiver of God in
addition to the songs about Yegry the Brave already mentioned The
groundwork of The Dove Book is of very ancient heathen origin and
almost identical with the oldest religious songs of the Greeks The book
itself is somewhat suggestive of the little book in Revelation The
Dove Book falls from Alatr the burning white stone on the Island of
Buyn the heathen Paradise which corresponds to our Fortunate Isles
of the Blest in the Western Sea but lies far towards sunrise in the
Ocean Sea The heathen significance of this stone is not known but it
is cleverly explained in The Dove Book as the stone whereon Christ
stood when he preached to his disciples This little book forty
fathoms long and twenty wide was written by St John the Evangelist
and no man can read it The prophet Isaiah deciphered only three pages
of it in as many years But the Most Wise Tzar David undertakes to
give from memory the books answers to various questions put to him by
Tzar Vladmir as spokesman of a throng of emperors and princes A great
deal of curious information is conveyedall very poetically
expressedincluding some odd facts in natural history such as that
the ostrich is the mother of birds and that she lives feeds and rears
her young on the blue sea drowning mariners and sinking ships Whenever
she or the whale on which the earth rests moves an earthquake ensues
There are several versions of this ballad The following abridged
extracts from one version will show its style Among the questions put
to the Most Wise Tzar David by Prince Vladmir are some touching the
works of God and our life our life of holy Russia our life in the
free world how the free light came to us why our sun is red why our
stars are thickly sown why our nights are dark what causes our red
dawns why we have fine drizzling rains whence cometh our intellect
why our bones are strong and so forth

Tzar David replies Our free white light began at Gods decree the sun
is red from the reflection of Gods face of the face of Christ the
King of Heaven the younger light the moon from his bosom cometh the
myriad stars are from his vesture the dark nights are the Lords
thoughts the red dawns come from the Lords eyes the stormy winds from
the Holy Spirit our intellects from Christ himself the King of Heaven
our thoughts from the clouds of heaven our world of people from Adam
our strong bones from the stones our bodies from the damp earth our
blood from the Black Sea In answer to other questions Tzar David
explains that the Jordan is the mother of all rivers because Jesus
Christ was baptized in it the cypress is the mother of all trees
because Christ was crucified on it the ocean is the mother of all seas
because in the middle of the oceansea rose up a cathedral church the
goal of all pilgrimages the cathedral of St Clement the pope of Rome
from this cathedral the Queen of Heaven came forth bathed herself in
the oceansea prayed to God in the cathedral which is a very unusual
touch of Romanism

The ancient religious ballads have no rhyme and unlike the epic songs
no fixed rhythm The presence of either rhyme or rhythm is an indication
of comparatively recent origin or of reconstruction in the sixteenth
century

The Merciful Woman of Compassion or The Alleluia Woman dates from
the most ancient Christian tradition and is a model of simplicity and
beauty It is allied to the English ballad of The Flight into Egypt
which also occurs among the Christmas carols of the Slavonians of the
Carpathian Mountains in which the Virgin Mary works a miracle with the
peasants grain in order to save Christ from the Jews in pursuit The
Virgin comes to the Alleluia Woman with the infant Christ in her
arms saying Cast thy child into the oven and take Christ the Lord in
thy lap His enemies the Jews are hastening hither they seek to kill
Christ the Lord with sharp spears The Alleluia Woman obeys without an
instants hesitation When the Jews arrive immediately afterwards and
inquire if Christ has passed that way she says she has thrown him into
the oven The Jews are convinced of the truth of her statement by the
sight of a childs hand amid the flames whereupon they dance for joy
and depart after fastening an iron plate over the oven door Christ
vanishes from the arms of the merciful woman she remembers her own
child and begins to weep Then Christs voice assures her that he is
well and happy On opening the oven door she beholds her baby playing
with the flowers in a rich green meadow reading the Gospels or rolling
an apple on a platter and comforted by angels

The Wanderings of the AllHoly Birthgiver of God another very
ancient ballad represents the Virgin Mother wandering among the
mountains in search of Christ She encounters three Jews and in answer
to her query Accursed Jews what have ye done with Christ they
inform her that they have just crucified him on Mount Zion She hastens
thither and swoons on arriving When she recovers she makes her
lament and her plakh or wail beginning O my dear son why didst
thou not obey thy mother Christ comforts her telling her that he
shall rise again and bidding her Do not weep and spoil thy beauty A
form of the ballad which is common in Little Russia reverses the
situation It is the Jews who inquire of Mary what she has done with her
son Into the river I flung him she promptly replies They drain the
river and find him not Again they ask Under the mountains I buried
him They dig up the mountains and find him not At last they discover
a church and in it three coffins Over the Holy Virgins the birds are
warbling or flowers are blossoming over John the Baptists lights are
burning over Christs angels are singing

As might be expected the Holy Virgin is a very popular subject of song
In numerous ballads she delivers a temperance lecture to St Vasly the
Great on his drunkenness putting to him various questions such as
Who sleeps through matins Who walks and riots during the liturgy
St Vasly being the author of a liturgy which is used on certain
important occasions during the church year Who has unwashed hands
Who is a murderer and so on through a long list of peccadilloes and
crimes The answer to each question is The drunkard Poor St Vasly
dashes his head against a stone and threatens to put an end to himself
on the spot if his one lapse in five and twenty years be not forgiven
Accordingly the Holy Virgin steps down from her throne gives him her
hand and informs him that the Lord has three mansions one is the House
of David where the Last Judgment will take place through the second
flows a river of fire the destination of wizards drunkards and the
like and the third is Paradise the home of the elect The imagery in
the very numerous and ancient poems on the Last Judgment by the way is
purely heathen in character The ferryman over the river of fire
sometimes acts as the judge and the punishments to which sinners are
condemned by him recall those mentioned in the neid and in Dantes
Divina Commedia the frescoes on the walls of churches bearing out the
same idea

Adam and Eve naturally receive a share of the minstrels attention and
Adams Wail before the gates of Paradise is often very touching In a
ballad from White Russia Adam begs the Lord to permit him to revisit
Paradise The Lord accordingly gives orders to St PeterPaul to admit
Adam to Paradise to have the song of the Cherubim sung for him and so
forth but not to allow him to remain In the midst of Paradise Adam
beholds his coffin and wails before it O my coffin coffin my true
home Take me O my coffin as a mother her own child to thy white
arms to thy ruddy face to thy warm heart But St PeterPaul soon
catches sight of him and tells him that he has no business to be
strolling about and spying out Paradise his place is on Zions hill
where he will be shown books of magic and of life and things in
general

There is a great mass of poetry devoted to Joseph and a lament to
Mother Desert uttered as he is being led away into captivity by the
merchants to whom his brethren have sold him soon becomes the
groundwork for variations in which the Scripture story is entirely
forgotten In these Joseph is always a Tzarvitch or kings son his
father being sometimes David sometimes the Tzar of India or of the
Idolaters Land or some such country He is confined in a tower
because the soothsayers have foretold that he will become a Christian
or because he is already a Christian he shuts himself up One day he
is permitted to ride about the town and although all old people have
been ordered to keep out of sight he espies one aged cripple and thus
learns that his father has grossly deceived him in asserting that no
one ever becomes old or ill in his kingdom He forthwith becomes a
Christian and flees to the desert Then comes his wail to Mother
Desert Most Fair as she stands afar off in the valley O Desert
fair receive me to thy depths as a mother her own child and a pastor
his faithful sheep into thy voiceless quiet beloved mother mine
Mother Desert proceeds to remonstrate with her beloved child Who
is to rule she says over thy kingdom thy palaces of white stone
thy young bride When spring cometh all the lakes will be aflood all
the trees will be clothed with verdure heavenly birds will warble
therein with voices angelic in the desert thou wilt have none of this
thy food will be firbark thy drink marshwater Nevertheless Joseph
Tzarvitch persists in his intention and Mother Desert receives him at
last Most versions of this ballad are full of genuine poetry but a few
are rather ludicrous for example Mother Desert asks Joseph How
canst thou leave thy sweet viands and soft featherbeds to come to me

Of David strange to say we find very little mention save in the Dove
Book or as the father of Joseph or of some other equally preposterous
person

Among the ballads on themes drawn from the New Testament those relating
to the birth of Christ and the visit of the Wise Men to John the
Baptist and to Lazarus are the most numerous The Three Wise Men
sometimes bring queer gifts One ballad represents them as being
Lithuanians and only two in number who bring Christ offerings of
botvnyaa savory and popular dish in the form of a soup served
cold with ice and composed of small beer brewed from sour black rye
bread slightly thickened with strained spinach in which float cubes of
fresh cucumber the green tops of young onions cold boiled fish
horseradish bacon sugar shrimps any cold vegetables on hand and
whatever else occurs to the cook Joseph stands by the window holding a
bowl and a spoon and stares at the gift Queer people you
Lithuanians he remarks Christ doesnt eat botvnya He eats only
rolls with milk and honey or rolls and butter In one case the Three
Wise Men appear as three buffaloes bringing gifts in another as the
fine rain the red sun and the bright moon showing that nature
worship can assume a very fair semblance of Christianity

Christs baptism is sometimes represented by his mother bathing him in
the river and this is thought to stand for the weary sun which is
bathed every night in the ocean A Legend of the Sun whose
counterpart can be found in other lands represents the sun as being
attended by flaming birds who dip their wings in the ocean at night and
sprinkle him and by angels who carry his imperial robe and crown to the
Lords throne every night and clothe him again in them every morning
while the cock proclaims the resurrection of all things In the
Christmas carols angels perform the same offices and the flaming
phoenixbirds are omitted

The Apostle Peters timid and disputatious character seems to be well
understood by the people One day according to a ballad he gets into a
dispute with the Lord as to which is the larger heaven or earth The
earth declares St Peter Heaven maintains the Lord But let us
not quarrel Call down two or three angels to measure heaven and earth
with a silken cord So was it done and lo St Peter was right and the
Lord was wrong Heaven is the smaller because it is all level while
the earth has hills and valleys

On another occasion all the saints were sitting at table except the
Holy Spirit Peter Peter my servant says the Lord go bring the
Holy Spirit Peter has not traversed half the road when he encounters
a wondrous marvel a fearful fire He trembles with fear and turns
back Why hast thou not brought the Holy Spirit inquires the Lord
Peter explains Ho Peter that is no marvel that is the Holy Spirit
Thou shouldst have brought it hither and placed it on the table All the
saints would have rejoiced that the Holy Spirit sat before them

The Lazarus ballads illustrate how the people turn Scriptural characters
into living realities by incorporating their own observations on human
nature with the sacred text According to them Lazarus and Dives were
two brothers both named Lazarus the younger rich the elder poor Poor
Lazarus begs alms of his brother How dare you call me brother
retorts rich Lazarus I have brothers like myselfprinces nobles
wealthy merchants who fare sumptuously and dress richly Even the
church dignitaries visit me Your brethren are the fierce dogs which lie
under my table and gather up the fragments I fear not God I will buy
off intrusive death I will attain to the kingdom of heaven and if I
attain not thereunto I will buy it Thereupon he sets the dogs on his
brother spits in his eye locks the gates and goes back to his
feasting The dogs which are set upon poor Lazarus bring him their food
instead of rending him After three efforts to move his brother to
compassion poor Lazarus entreats the Lord to let him die Send sudden
death Lord winged but not merciful he prays Send two threatening
angels let them take out my unclean soul through my side with a hook
my little soul through my ribs with a spear and with iron hooks let
them place my soul under their left wing and carry it to the nethermost
hell to burning pitch and the river of fire All my life have I
suffered hunger and cold and my whole body hath been full of pains It
is not for me a poor cripple to enter Paradise This is in
accordance with the uncomfortable Russian belief that a mans rank and
station in this life determine his fate in the other world But the
Lord gives orders to have everything done in precisely the opposite way
Holy angels remove Lazaruss soul gently through his sugar mouth
referring possibly to the Siberian belief that the soul is located in
the windpipe wrap it in a white cloth and carry it to Abrahams bosom
After a while rich Lazarus is overtaken by misfortune and illness and
he also prays for speedy death minutely specifying how his large
clean soul is to be handled and deposited in Abrahams bosom He
acknowledges that he has committed a few trivial sins but mentions
with pride in extenuation that he has never worn anything but velvet
and satin and that he formerly possessed great store of flowered
garments Again the Lord gives contrary orders and rich Lazarus
undergoes the treatment which his poor brother had indicated for his own
soul When rich Lazarus looks up from his torment and beholds poor
Lazarus in Abrahams bosom he addresses him as Brother my own
brother Here one version comes to a sudden end and the collector who
transcribed it asked What He repented answered the peasant woman
who sang it and called him brother when he saw that he was well
off In other versions a long conversation ensues in the course of
which poor Lazarus reminds rich Lazarus of numerous sins of omission and
commission and inquires with great apparent solicitude what has
become of all his gold silver flowered garments and so forth and
assures him that he would gladly give him not a drop but a whole
bucketful of water were he permitted to do so

But to the share of no saint does a greater number of songs and
festivals fall than to that of John the Baptist In addition to June
th which still bears the heathen name of Kuplo in connection with
St Johns Eve and which is celebrated by the peasants in as thoroughly
heathen a fashion as is the Christmas festival in honor of the
Sungoddess Kolyda he has three special days dedicated to him Two of
these deserve mention because of a curious superstition attached to
them On St Johns Day May th the peasants set out their cabbages
but on the autumn St Johns Day August th they must carefully avoid
all contact with cabbages because it is the anniversary of the
beheading of John no knife must be taken in the hand on that day and
it is considered a great crime to cut anything particularly anything
round resembling a head If a cabbage be cut blood will flow if
anything round be eatenonions for examplecarbuncles will follow

In concluding this brief sketch of the religious ballads of the
Slavonians I venture to quote at length a masterpiece of the Wandering
Cripples art It is a Montenegrin version of a legend which is common
to all the Slavonic peoples and contains besides an interesting
problem in ethics an explanation of the present shape of the human
foot In some versions the emperors crown is replaced throughout by
the bright sun thus suggesting a mythological origin It is called
The Emperor Diocletian and John the Baptist

    Two foster brothers were drinking wine
    On a sunny slope by the salt seaside
    One was the Emperor Diocletian
    The other John the Baptist
    Then up spake John the Baptist
    As they did drink the wine
    Foster brother come now let us play
    Use thou thy crown but I will take an apple
    Then up they jumped began to play
    And St John flung his apple
    Down in the depths of the sea it fell
    And his warm tears trickled down
    But the emperor held this speech to him
    Now weep not dear my brother
    Only carry thou not my crown away
    And I will fetch thy apple
    Then did John swear to him by God
    That he would not steal the crown
    The emperor swam out into the sea
    But John flew up to heaven
    Presented himself before the Lord
    And held this speech to him
    Eternal God and AllHoly Father
    May I swear falsely by thee
    May I steal the emperors crown
    The Lord replied
    O John my faithful servant
    Thrice shalt thou swear falsely by me
    Only by my name must thou not swear
    St John flew back to the sunny slope
    And the emperor emerged from the sea
    Again they played again John flung his apple
    Again it fell into the depths of the sea
    But Diocletian the emperor said to him
    Now fear thou not dear brother
    Only carry thou my crown not away
    And I will fetch thy apple
    Then did John swear to him by God
    Thrice did he swear to him by God
    That he would not steal his crown
    The emperor threw his crown under his cap
    Beside them left the bird of ill omen
    And plunged into the blue sea
    St John froze over the sea
    With a twelvefold icecrust he froze it oer
    Seized the golden crown flew on high to heaven
    And the bird of ill omen began to caw
    The emperor at the bottom of the sea divined the cause
    Raced up as for a wager
    Brake three of the icecrusts with his head
    Then back turned he again took a stone upon his head
    A little stone of three thousand pounds
    And brake the twelvefold ice
    Then unfolded he his wings
    Set out in pursuit of John
    Caught up with him at the gate of heaven
    Seized him by his right foot
    And what he grasped he tore away
    In tears came John before the Lord
    The bright sun brought he to heaven
    And John complained unto the Lord
    That the emperor had crippled him
    And the Lord said
    Fear not my faithful servant
    I will do the same to every man
    Such is the fact and to God be the glory

Therefore say the Servians in conclusion of their version of this
ballad God has made a hollow in the sole of every human beings foot

The Epic Songs properly speaking are broadly divisible into three
groups the Cycle of Vladmir or of Keff that of Nvgorod and that
of Moscow or the Imperial Cycle the whole being preceded by the songs
of the elder heroes With regard to the first two and the Keff Cycle
in particular undoubtedly composed during the tenth eleventh and
twelfth centuries authorities on the origin of Russian literature
differ considerably One authority maintains that although the Russian
epics possess a family likeness to the heroic legends of other Aryan
races the Russians forgot them and later on appropriated them again
from UralAltaic sources adding a few historical and geographical
names and psychical characteristics But this view as to the wholesale
appropriation of Oriental myths has not been established and the
authorities who combat it demonstrate that the heroes are thoroughly
Russian and that the pictures of manners and customs which they present
are extremely valuable for their accuracy They would seem on the
whole to be a characteristic mixture of natural phenomena nature
myths personified as gods who became in course of time legendary
heroes Thus Prince Vladmir the Fair Red Sun may be the Sungod
but he is also a historical personage whatever may be said as to many
of the other characters in the epic lays of the Vladmir cycle Sadk
the rich Guest of Nvgorod also in the song of that title belonging
to the Nvgorod cycle was a prominent citizen of Nvgorod who built a
church in Nvgorod during the twelfth century and is referred to in
the Chronicles for a space of two hundred years In fact the Nvgorod
cycle contains less of the personified phenomena of nature than the
cycle of the Elder Heroes and the Keff cycle and more of the genuine
historical element

A regular tonic versification forms one of the indispensable properties
of these epic poems irregularity of versification is a sign of decay
and a complete absence of measure that is to say the prose form is
the last stage of decay The airs to which they are sung or chanted are
very simple consisting of but few tones yet are extremely difficult
to note down The peasant bard modifies the one or two airs to which he
chants his lays with astonishing skill according to the testimony of
Rbnikoff who made the first large collection of the songs in the
Olnetz government  and Hilferding who made a still more
surprising collection  to the north and east of Olnetz

The lay of Sadk above mentioned is perhaps the most famousthe one
most frequently alluded to in Russian literature and art Sadk was a
harper of Lord Nvgorod the Great No golden treasures did he
possess He went about to the magnificent feasts of the merchants and
nobles and made all merry with his playing Once for three days in
succession he was bidden to no worshipful feast and in his sorrow he
went and played all day long upon the shore of Lake lmen On the third
day the Water King appears to him and thanks him for entertaining his
guests in the depths He directs Sadk to return to Nvgorod and on the
morrow when he shall be bidden to a feast and the banqueters begin the
characteristic brags of their possessions Sadk must wager his
turbulent head against the merchants shop in the bazaar with all the
precious wares therein that Lake lmen contains fishes with fins of
gold Sadk wins the bet for the Tzar Vodyany sends up the fish to be
caught in the silken net Thus did Sadk become a rich guest merchant
of the first class of Nvgorod built himself a palace of white stone
wondrously adorned and became exceeding rich He also held worshipful
feasts and outbragged the braggers declaring that he would buy all
the wares in Nvgorod or forfeit thirty thousand in money As he
continues to buy wares continue to flow into this Venice of the North
and Sadk decides that it is the part of wisdom to pay his thirty
thousand He then builds thirty dark red ships and three of the
dragon type lades them with the wares of Nvgorod and sails out into
the open sea via the river Vlkhoff Lake Ldoga and the Nev After a
while the ships stand still and will not stir though the waves dash and
the breeze whistles through the sails Sadk arrives at the conclusion
that the Sea King demands tribute as they have now been sailing the
seas for twelve years and have paid none They cast into the waves
casks of red gold pure silver and fair round pearls but still the
ships move not Sadk then proposes that each man on board shall prepare
for himself a lot and cast it into the sea and the man whose lot sinks
shall consider himself the sacrifice which the Sea King requires
Sadks lot persists in sinking whether he makes it of hopflowers or
of blue damaskeened steel four hundred pounds in weight and all the
other lots swim whether heavy or light Accordingly Sadk perceives
that he is the destined victim and taking his harp a holy image of St
Nicholas the patron of travelers and bowls of precious things with
him he has himself abandoned on an oaken plank while his ships sailed
off and flew as they had been black ravens He sinks to the bottom
and finds himself in the palace of the Sea King who makes him play
while he the fair seamaidens and the other seafolk dance violently
But the Tzartza warns Sadk to break his harp for it is the waves
dancing on the shore and creating terrible havoc The Tzar Morsky then
requests Sadk to select a wife and guided again by the Tzartzas
advice Sadk selects the last of the nine hundred maidens who file
before hima small blackvisaged maiden named Tchernva Had he
chosen otherwise he is told he would never again behold the white
world but must forever abide in the blue sea After a great feast
which the Sea King makes for him Sadk falls into a heavy sleep and
when he awakens from it he finds himself on the bank of the Tchernva
River and sees his dark red ships come speeding up the Vlkhoff River
Sadk returns to his palace and his young wife builds two churches and
roams no more but thereafter takes his ease in his own town

Between these cycles of epic songs and the Moscow or Imperial Cycle
there is a great gap The preTatr period is not represented and the
cycle proper begins with Ivn the Terrible and ends with the reign of
Peter the Great Epic marvels are not wholly lacking in the Moscow
cycle evidently copied from the earlier cycles But these songs are
inferior in force Fantastic as are some of the adventures in these
songs there is always a solid historical foundation Ivn the Terrible
for instance is credited with many deeds of his grandfather his father
being ignored and is always represented in rather a favorable light
The conquest of Siberia the capture of Kazn and strakhan the wars
against Poland and the Tatrs of Crimea and so forth are the
principal points around which these songs are grouped But the Peter the
Great of the epics bears only a faint resemblance to the real Peter

Perhaps the most famous hero of epic song in the seventeenth century is
the banditchief of the Volga Stnka Rzin whose memory still lingers
among the peasants of those regions He was regarded as the champion of
the people against the oppression of the nobles and Ily of Mrom the
Old Kazk is represented as the captain of the brigands under him To
Stnka also are attributed magic powers From the same period date
also the two most popular dancesongs of the present daythe
Kamarnskaya and Brynya Sudrynya its sequel The Kamarnskaya was
the district which then constituted the Ukrana or bordermarches
situated about where the government of Orl now is The two songs
present a valuable historical picture of the coarse manners of the
period on that lawless frontier hence only a few of the lines which
still subsist of these poetical chronicles can be used to the
irresistibly dashing music

The power of composing epic songs has been supposed to have gradually
died out almost ceasing with the reign of Peter the Great wholly
ceasing with the war of  But very recently an interesting
experiment has been begun based on the discovery of several new songs
about the Emperor Alexander II which are sung by the peasants over a
wide range of country All these songs are being written down with the
greatest accuracy as to the peculiarities of pronunciation and
accentuation If in the future variants make their appearance
containing an increasing infusion of the artistic and poetical elements
considerable light will be thrown upon the problem of the rise and
growth of the ancient epic songs and on the question of poetical
inspiration among the peasants of the present epoch One of these
ballads written down in the Province of the Don from the lips of a
blind beggar says that Alexander II burned with love wished to give
freedom to all kept all under his wing and freed them from punishment
He reformed all the laws heard the groans of the needy and himself
hastened to their aid So the wicked killed him says the ballad and
proceeds to describe the occurrence including the way in which the
black flag was lowered on the palace and they sent a telegram about
the eclipse of our sun In the far northern government of Kostrom on
the Volga two more ballads on the same subject have been taken down on
the typewriter so that the bard could readily correct them The first
entitled A Lay of Mourning for the Death of the Tzar Liberator
narrates how a dreadful cloud of black bloodthirsty ravens assembled
and invited to them the underground subterranean rats not to a
feastball not to a christening but to undermine the roots of the
olivebranch Naturally this style demands that the emperor be
designated as the bright falcon light winged swift eyed It
describes the plot and how the bombs were to be wrapped up in white
cloths and the conspirators were to go for a stroll as with
watermelons When the bombs burst the panes in the neighboring houses
are shattered and the dark blue feathers of the bright falcon are
set on fire As there were no Kostrom peasants on hand to aid the
emperorno Komisroffs or Susnins adds the ballad with local pride
alluding to the legend of Ivn Susnin saving the first Romnoff Tzar
from the Poles in  which forms the subject of the famous opera by
Glnka Life for the Tzar he laid himself down in the bosom of his
mother earth The second ballad is The MonumentNot MadewithHands
to the Tzar Liberatorthe compound adjective here referring to that in
the title of a favorite ikna or Holy Picture which corresponds to
the one known in western Europe as the imprint of the Saviours face on
St Veronicas kerchief There are four stanzas of six lines each of
which the third runs as follows

    He is our Liberator and our father
    And we will erect a monument of hearts
    Whose cross by its gleaming mid the clouds
    Shall transmit the memory to young children and the babes in arms
    And this shall be unto ages of ages
    So long as the world and man shall exist

In southwestern Russia where the ancient epic songs of the Elder Heroes
and the Keff Cycle originated the memory of them has died out owing
to the devastation of southern Russia by the Tatrs in the thirteenth
and fourteenth centuries and the decay of its civilization under
Lithuanian sway in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries In the
sixteenth century the population of southern Russia reorganized itself
in the forms of kazk communes and fabricated for itself a fresh cycle
of epic legends which replaced those of Keff and there the kobzrs
professional minstrels who accompany their songs on the kbza a
mandolinlike twelvestringed instrument celebrate the deeds of a new
race of kazk heroes But in the lonely wildernesses of the northeast
whither the Tatr invasion drove the descendants of those who composed
and sang the great epic songs no more recent upheavals have brought
forward heroes to replace the historic paladins who there hold
undisputed sway to the present time

Of the songs still sung by the people the following favorite in the
version from the Olnetz government may serve as a sample It is not
rhymed in the original

    Akh Little guelderrose with pinkish azure bloom
    And merry little company where my dear one doth drink
    My darling will not drink until for me he sends
    When I a maiden very young did dally
    Tending the ducks the geese the swans
    When I a young maid very young along the streambank strolled
    I trampled down all sickly leaves and grass
    I plucked the tiny azure flowerets
    At the swift little rivulet I gazed
    Small was the hamlet there four cots in all
    In every cot four windows small
    In every little window a dear young crony sits
    Eh cronies dear you darlings friends of mine
    Be ye my cronies one another love love me
    When into the garden green ye go then take me too
    When each a wreath ye twine twine one for me
    When in the Danubes stream ye fling them drop mine too
    The garlands all upon the surface float mine only hath sunk down
    All your dear loverfriends have homeward come mine only cometh not

where the women were secluded in Oriental fashion

 Lord in the original is Gosudr the word which with a capital
is applied especially to the emperor

 The dramatist Ostrvsky has made effective use of this game and the

CHAPTER II

THE ANCIENT PERIOD FROM THE INTRODUCTION OF CHRISTIANITY TO THE TATR
DOMINION 


As soon as Prince Saint Vladmir introduced Christianity into Russia he
and his sons began to busy themselves with the problem of general
education Priests came from Greece and Bulgaria to spread the Gospel in
Russia but they thought only of disseminating Christianity and were
moreover not sufficiently numerous to grapple with educational
problems Accordingly Vladmir founded schools in Keff and ordered
that the children of the best citizens should be taken from their
unwilling parents and handed over to these schools for instruction His
son Yroslaff I the wise pursued the same policy in Keff and
elsewherethe schools being attached to the churches and having for
their chief object the preparation of ecclesiastics The natural result
was that in ancient Russia most people who could read and write were
ecclesiastics or monks and religious literature was that most highly
prized Even socalled worldly literature was strongly tinctured with
religion The first Russian literary compositions took the form of
exhortations sermons and messages addressed by the clergy to their
flocks and the first Russian authors were Ilarin metropolitan of
Keff beginning in  and Luk Zhidyta appointed bishop of
Nvgorod in  The latters Exhortation to the Brethren has come
down to us and is noteworthy for the simplicity of its language and
its conciseness of form From Ilarin we have a Word Concerning the
Law meaning the Law of God which deals with the opposing character
of Judaism and Christianity It proves not only that he was a cultivated
man capable of expressing himself clearly on complicated matters but
also that his hearers were capable of comprehending him Other good
writers of that period were Feodsiy elected in  abbott of the
Monastery of the Catacombs in Keff which was fated to become one of
the most important nurseries of enlightenment and literature in Russia
Nestor who left a remarkable Life of Feodsiy Nikifr a Greek by
birth educated in Byzantium who was metropolitan of Keff 
and Kyrll bishop of Nvgorod 

Thus it will be seen events took their ordinary course in Russia as in
other countries learning was for a long time confined almost
exclusively to the monasteries which were the pioneers in education and
culture elements such as they were Naturally the bulk of the
literature for a long time consisted of commentaries on the Holy
Scriptures translations from the works of the fathers of the church
Eastern Catholic homilies pastoral letters and the like But in the
monasteries also originated the invaluable Chronicles for not only
did men speedily begin to describe in writing those phenomena of life
which impressed them as worthy of note but ecclesiastics were in a
position to learn all details of importance from authoritative sources
and were even not infrequently employed as diplomatic agents or acted
as secretaries to the ruling princes The earliest and most celebrated
among these ancient Russian historical works is the Chronicle of
Nestor a monk of the Catacombs Monastery in Keff born about 
the reputed author of the document which bears his name Modern
scientists have proved that he did not write this Chronicle the
earliest copy of which dates from the fourteenth century but its
standing as a priceless monument of the twelfth century has never been
impunged since it is evident that the author gathered his information
from contemporary eyewitnesses The Chronicle begins by describing how
Shem Ham and Japhet shared the earth between them after the flood and
gives a detailed list of the countries and peoples of the ancient world
It then states that after the building of the Tower of Babel God
dispersed all the peoples into seventytwo tribes or languages the
northern and western lands falling to the tribe of Japhet Nestor
derives the Slavonians from Japhetdescribes their life first on the
banks of the Danube then their colonization to the northeast as far as
the River lmen the ancient Nvgorod the Ok in central Russia and
the tributaries of the Dnipr delineating the manners and customs of
the different Slavonic tribes and bringing the narrative down to the
year  in the form of brief complete stories The style of the
Chronicle is simple and direct For example he relates how in the year
 the Drevlyns or forestfolk slew gor prince of Keff and his
band of warriors who were not numerous

     Then said the Drevlyns Here we have slain the Russian
     Prince let us now take his wife Olga for our Prince Malo
     and we will take also Svytoslaff his son and will deal with
     him as we see fit and the Drevlyns dispatched their best
     men twenty in number in a boat to Olga and they landed
     their boat near Bortcheff and Olga was told that the
     Drevlyns had arrived and Olga summoned them to her Good
     guests are come I hear and the Drevlyns said We are come
     Princess And Olga said to them Tell me why are ye come
     hither Said the Drevlyns The land of the Drevlyns hath
     sent us saying thus We have slain thy husband for thy
     husband was like unto a wolf he was ever preying and robbing
     but our own princes are good Our Drevlyn land doth flourish
     under their sway wherefore marry thou our Prince Malo for
     the Drevlyn Prince was named Malo Olga said to them Your
     speech pleaseth me for my husband cannot be raised from the
     dead but I desire to show you honor tomorrow before my
     people wherefore today go ye to your boat and lie down in
     the boat exalting yourselves and tomorrow I will send for
     you and ye must say we will not ride on horses we will not
     walk afoot but do ye carry us in our boat Thus did she
     dismiss them to the boat Then Olga commanded a great and deep
     pit to be digged in the courtyard of the palace outside the
     town And the next morning as Olga sat in her palace she sent
     for the guests and Olgas people came to them saying Olga
     biddeth you to a great honor But they said We will not ride
     on horses nor on oxen neither will we walk afoot but do thou
     carry us in our boat And the Kievlyns said We must
     perforce carry you our prince is slain and our princess
     desireth to wed your prince and they bore them in the boat
     and those men sat there and were filled with pride and they
     carried them to the courtyard to Olga and flung them into the
     pit together with their boat And Olga bending over the pit
     said unto them Is the honor to your taste and they made
     answer It is worse than gors death and she commanded that
     they be buried alive and they were so buried

The narrative goes on to state that Olga sent word to the Drevlyns
that if they were in earnest their distinguished men must be sent to
woo her for their prince otherwise the Kievlyns would not let her go
Accordingly they assembled their best men the rulers and sent them
for her Olga had the bath heated and ordered them to bathe before
presenting themselves to her and when they began to wash Olga had the
bathhouse set on fire and burned them up Then Olga sent again to the
Drevlyns demanding that they collect a vast amount of hydromel in the
town where her husband had been slain that she might celebrate the
ancient funeral feast and weep over his grave So they got the honey
together and brewed the hydromel or mead and Olga taking with her a
small bodyguard in light marching order set out on the road and came
to her husbands grave and wept over it and commanded her people to
erect a high mound over it and when that was done she ordered the
funeral feast to be celebrated on its summit Then the Drevlyns sat
down to drink and Olga ordered her servingboys to wait on them And
the Drevlyns asked Olga where was the guard of honor which they had
sent for her And she told them that it was following with her husbands
bodyguard But when the Drevlyns were completely intoxicated she
ordered her servinglads to drink in their honor went aside and
commanded her men to slay the Drevlyns which was done five hundred
dying thus Then Olga returned to Keff and made ready an army against
the remaining Drevlyns Such is one of the vivid pictures of ancient
manners and customs which the chronicle of Nestor furnishes

The descendants of PrinceSaint Vladmir were not only patrons of
education but collectors of books One of them in particular Vladmir
Monomchus is also noted as the author of the Exhortation of Vladmir
Monomchus end of the eleventh century which he wrote for his
children in the style of a pastoral address from an ecclesiastic to
his flocka style which in Russia as elsewhere was the inevitable
result of the first efforts at nonreligious literature in the eleventh
and twelfth centuries Chiefest of all he writes among other things
forget not the poor and feed them according to your powers give most
of all to the orphans and be ye yourselves the defenders of the widows
permitting not the mighty to destroy a human being Slay ye not either
the righteous or the guilty yourselves neither command others to slay
them In discourse whatsoever ye shall say whether good or evil swear
ye not by God neither cross ye yourselves there is no need of it
Reverence the aged as your father the young as brethren In thy house
be not slothful but see to all thyself put not thy trust in a steward
neither in a servant that thy guests jeer not at thy house nor at thy
dinner Love your wives but give them no power over you Forget not
the good ye know and what ye know not as yet that learn ye and so
forth

The beginning of the twelfth century witnessed other notable attempts at
secular literature To the twelfth century also belongs Russias
single written epic song The Word or lay Concerning gors Raid
which contains an extremely curious mixture of Christianity and heathen
views By a fortunate chance this epic was preserved and was
discovered in  by Count MsinPshkin among a collection which he
had purchased from a monastery Unhappily Count MsinPshkins
valuable library was burned during the conflagration of Moscow in 
But the Slvo had been twice published previous to that date and had
been examined by many learned paleographists who decided that the
chirography belonged to the end of the fourteenth century or the
beginning of the fifteenth century

gor Svytoslavitch was the prince of NvgorodSyversk who in 
made a raid against the Plovtzy or Plaindwellers and the Word begins
thus

    Shall we not begin our song oh brothers
    With the story of the feuds of old
    Song of the valiant troop of gor
    And of him the son of Svytoslaff
    And sing them as men now do sing
    Striving not in thought after Boyn
    Making this ballad he was wont the Wizard
    As a squirrel swift to flit about the forest
    As a gray wolf oer the clear plain to trot
    And as an eagle neath the clouds to hover
    When he recalleth ancient feuds of yore
    Then from out the flock of swans he sendeth
    In pursuit ten falcons swift of wing

The whole expedition is described in this poetical style in three
hundred and eightyfour unrhymed lines with a curious mingling of
heathen beliefs and Christian views God shows gor the road to the
land of Plovetzk to the Russian land and on his return from
captivity gor rides to Keff to salute the Holy Birthgiver of God of
Pirogshtch while the Plovtzy are called accursed in contrast with
the orthodox Russians But the winds are called the grandchildren of
Stribog and the Russian people are alluded to as the grandsons of
Dzhbog both heathen divinities and other mythical and obscure
personages are introduced

With this epic lay the first period of Russian literature closes

CHAPTER III

SECOND PERIOD FROM THE TATR DOMINION TO THE TIME OF IVN THE TERRIBLE



During the Tatr Dominion or yoke  Keff lost its
supremacy and also ceased to be as it had been up to this time the
center of education and literature The dispersive influence of the
Tatr raids had the effect of creating centers in the northeast which
were eventually concentrated in Moscow and in so far it proved a
blessing in disguise for Russia The conditions of life under the Tatr
sway were such that any one man or woman who valued a peaceful
existence or existence at all was driven to seek refuge in
monasteries The inevitable consequence was that a religious even an
sthetic cast was imparted to what little literature was created One
celebrated production dating from about the middle of the fourteenth
century will serve to give an idea of the sort of thing on which men
then exercised their minds and pens It is the Epistle of Archbishop
Vasly of Nvgorod to Fedor bishop of Tver entitled Concerning the
Earthly Paradise wherein the author discusses a subject of contention
which had arisen among the clergy of the latters diocese as to
whether the earthly paradise planted by God for Adam doth still exist
upon the earth or whether not the earthly but only an imaginary
paradise doth still exist The worthy archbishop with divers
arguments defends his position that the earthly paradise does still
exist in the East and hell in the West which latter proposition is not
surprising when we recall the historical circumstances under which it
was enounced

The monks continued to be the leaders in the educational and literary
army and under the stress of circumstances not only won immense
political influence over the life of the people but also developed a
new and special type of literaturepolitical sermonswhich attained to
particular development in the fourteenth century Another curious
phenomenon was presented by the narratives concerning various prominent
personages which contain precious facts and expressions of contemporary
views The authors always endeavored after the timehonored fashion of
biographers to exalt and adorn their subjects so that decorated
narratives a most apt title for that sort of literature in general
was the characteristic name under which they came to be known One
peculiarity of all of these it is worth noting including that which
dealt with the decisive battle with the Tatrs on the field of Kulikvo
on the Don in  under Dmtry Donsky Dmtry of the Don Prince of
Moscow is that they are imitated in style and language from the
famous Word Concerning gors Raid

Among the many purely secular tales of the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries preserved in manuscript not one has anything in common with
Russian national literature All are translations or reconstructions of
material derived from widely divergent sources such as the stories of
Alexander of Macedon of the Trojan War and various Oriental tales
About the middle of the sixteenth century Makry metropolitan of
Moscow collected in twelve huge volumes the Legends or Spiritual
Tales of the Saints under the title of Tchety Minyaliterally
Monthly Reading It was finished in  and contains thirteen hundred
Lives of Saints

CHAPTER IV

THIRD PERIOD FROM THE TIME OF IVN THE TERRIBLE  TO THE MIDDLE OF
THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY


Political events had tended to concentrate absolute power in the hands
of the Grand Princes of Moscow beginning with Ivn III But no
counterbalancing power had arisen in Russian society there was no
independent life no respect for the individual no public opinion to
counteract the abuse of power In the beginning of the sixteenth
century Russian society had reached the extreme limits of development
possible to it under its unfavorable conditions The time for the
Russian Renaissance had arrived It is well to remember that at this
time in other parts of Europe also the spirit of despotism and
intolerance was holding individual liberty in check This was the age of
Henry VIII of Catherine de Medici of the Inquisition and of the
Massacre of St Bartholomew

In this century of transition the sixteenth the man who exerted over
the spirit of the age more influence than any other was Maxm the Greek
 a learned scholar a monk of Mt Athos educated chiefly in
Italy He was invited to Russia by Grand Prince Vasly Ivnovitch for
the purpose of cataloguing a rich store of Greek manuscripts in the
library of the Grand Prince To his influence is due one of the most
noteworthy books of the sixteenth century the Stoglva or Hundred
Chapters a set of regulations adopted by the young Tzar Ivn
Vaslievitch afterwards known as Ivn the Terrible the son of Vasly
and by the most enlightened nobles of his time at a council held in
 Their object was to reform the decadent morals of the clergy and
various ecclesiastical and social disorders and in particular the
absolute illiteracy arising from the lack of schools Another famous
work of the same century is the Domostry or HouseRegulator
attributed to Pope priest Sylvester the celebrated confessor and
counselor of Ivn the Terrible in his youth In an introduction and
sixtythree chapters Sylvester sets forth the principles which should
regulate the life of every layman the management of his household and
family his relations to his neighbors his manners in church his
conduct towards his sovereign and the authorities his duties towards
his servants and subordinates and so forth The most curious part of
the work deals with the minute details of domestic economyone
injunction being that all men shall live in accordance with their means
or their salaryand family relations in the course of which the
position of woman in Russia of the sixteenth century is clearly defined
This portion is also of interest as the forerunner of a whole series of
articles in Russian literature on women wherein the latter are depicted
in the most absurd manner the most gloomy colorsarticles known as
About Evil Womenand founded on an admiration for Byzantine
asceticism In his Household Regulations Sylvester thus defines the
duties of woman

She goeth to church according to opportunity and the counsel of her
husband Husbands must instruct their wives with care and judicious
chastisement If a wife live not according to the precepts of her
husband her husband must reprove her in private and after that he hath
so reproved her he must pardon her and lay upon her his further
injunctions but they must not be wroth one with the other And only
when wife son or daughter accept not reproof shall he flog them with a
whip but he must not beat them in the presence of people but in
private and he shall not strike them on the ear or in the face or
under the heart with his fist nor shall he kick them or thrash them
with a cudgel or with any object of iron or wood But if the fault be
great then removing the offenders shirt he shall beat him or her
courteously with a whip and so forth

We have seen that Ivn IV the Terrible took the initiative in
reforms After the conquest of Kazn he established many churches in
that territory and elsewhere in Russia and purchased an immense
quantity of manuscript servicebooks for their use many of which turned
out to be utterly useless on account of the ignorance and carelessness
of the copyists This circumstance is said to have enforced upon Ivns
attention the advisability of establishing printingpresses in Russia
though there is reason to believe that Maxm the Greek had long before
suggested the idea to the Tzar Accordingly the erection of a
printinghouse was begun in  but it was only in April  that
printing could be begun and in March  the first book was
completedThe Acts of the Apostles The first book printed in Slavonic
however is the Oktikh or Book of the Eight Canonical Tones
containing the Hymns for Vespers Matins and kindred church services
which was printed in Cracow seventy years earlier and thirty years
earlier Venice was producing printed books in the Slavonic languages
while even in Lithuania and White Russia printed books were known
earlier than in Moscow After printing a second book the Book of
Hours the Tchasoslffalso connected with Vespers Matins kindred
services and the Liturgy in additionin  the printers both
Russians were accused of heresy of spoiling the book and were
compelled to flee from Moscow In  other printers produced in Moscow
the Psalter and other books In  in Ostrg Government of
Volhnia in a printinghouse founded by Prince Konstantn
Konstantnovitch Ostrzhsky was printed the famous Ostrzhsky Bible
which was as handsome as any product of the contemporary press anywhere
in Europe

Nevertheless manuscripts continued to circulate side by side with
printed books even during the reign of Peter the Great

During the reign of Ivn the Terrible secular literature and authors
from the highest classes of society again made their appearance in
fact they had never wholly disappeared during the interval Ivn the
Terrible himself headed the list and Prince Andri Mikhilovitch
Krbsky was almost his equal in rank and more than his equal in
importance from a literary point of view Ivn the Terribles writings
show the influence of his epoch his oppressed and agitated childhood
his defective education and like his character they are the perfectly
legitimate expression of all that had taken place in the kingdom of
Moscow

The most striking characteristic of Ivns writings is his malicious
biting irony concealed beneath an external aspect of calmness and it
is most noticeable in his principal works his Correspondence with
Prince Krbsky and his Epistle to Kozm Abbot of the
KirlloByelzersk Monastery They display him as a very wellread man
intimately acquainted with the Scriptures and the translations from the
Fathers of the Church and the Russian Chronicles as well as with
general history Abbot Kozm had complained to the Tzar concerning the
conduct of certain great nobles who had become inmates of his monastery
some voluntarily others by compulsion as exiles from court and who
were exerting a pernicious influence over the monks Ivn seized the
opportunity thus presented to him to pour out all the gall of his irony
on the monks who had forsaken the lofty spiritual traditions of the
great holy men of Russia

Of much greater importance as illustrating Ivns literary talent is
his Correspondence with Prince Krbsky  a warrior of birth
as good as Ivns own a former favorite of his who in  probably
in consequence of the profound change in Ivns conduct which had taken
place and weighed so heavily upon the remainder of his reign fled to
Ivns enemy the King of Poland The abuses of confidence and power
with the final treachery of Priest Sylvester Ivns adviser in
ecclesiastical affairs and of Adsheff his adviser in temporal
matters had changed the Tzar from a mild almost benevolent
sovereign into a raging despot On arriving in Poland Prince Krbsky
promptly wrote to Ivn announcing his defection and plainly stating the
reasons therefor When Ivn received this epistlethe first in the
celebrated and valuable historical correspondence which ensuedhe
thrust his ironshod staff through the foot of the bearer at the bottom
of the Red or Beautiful Staircase in the Kremlin and leaning heavily
upon it had the letter read to him the messenger making no sign of his
suffering the while Krbsky asserted the rights of the individual as
against the sovereign power and accused Ivn of misusing his power
Ivn on his side asserted his omnipotent rights ascribed to his own
credit all the noteworthy events of his reign accused Krbsky of
treason and demonstrated to the Prince with abundant Scriptural
quotations that he had not only ruined his own soul but also the
souls of his ancestorsa truly Oriental point of view If thou art
upright and pious he writes why wert not thou willing to suffer at
the hands of me thy refractory sovereign lord and receive from me the
crown of life Thou hast destroyed thy soul for the sake of thy body
 and hast waxed wroth not against a man but against God

Krbskys letters reveal in him a far more cultivated man with more
sense of decency and self control and even elegance of diction than
the Tzar He even reproaches the latter in one letter for his
ignorance of the proper way to write and for his lack of culture and
tells him he ought to be ashamed of himself comparing the Tzars
literary style with the ravings of women and accusing him of writing
barbarously

In addition to these letters Krbsky wrote a remarkable history of Ivn
the Terribles reign entitled A History of the Grand Principality of
Moscow Concerning the Deeds Which We Have Heard from Trustworthy Men
and Have also Beheld with Our Own Eyes It is brought down to the year
 This history is important as the first work in Russian literature
in which a completely successful attempt was made to write a fluent
historical narrative instead of setting forth facts in the style of
the Chronicles and link facts to preceding facts in logical sequence
deducing effects from causes

To the reign of Ivn the Terrible belong also A History of the
Kingdom of Kazn by Priest Ionn Glaztly and the Memoirs of Alexi
Adsheffthe most ancient memoirs in the Russian language

In the mean time during this same sixteenth century a new culture was
springing up in southwestern Russia and in western Russia then under
the rule of Poland and under the influence of the Jesuits Many
Russians had joined the Roman Church or the Union  by which
numerous eastern orthodox along the western frontier acknowledged the
supremacy of the Pope of Rome on condition of being allowed to retain
their own rites and vernacular in the church services In the end they
were gradually deprived of these almost entirely and curiously enough
the solution of this problem has been found within the last decade in
the United States where the immigrant Uniates are returning by the
thousand to the Russian Church In order to counteract the education and
the wiles of the Jesuits philanthropic Brotherhoods were formed among
the orthodox Christians of southwest Russia and these brotherhoods
founded schools in which instruction was given in the Greek Slavonic
Latin and Polish languages and rhetoric dialectics poetics
theology and many other branches were taught One of these schools in
Keff was presided over by Peter Moghla  the famous son of
the Voevda of Wallachia who was brilliantly educated on the Continent
and at one time had been in the military service of Poland Thus he
thoroughly understood the situation when later on  he became a
monk in the Keff Catacombs Monastery and eventually the archimandrite
or abbot and devoted his wealth and his life to the dissemination of
education among his fellowbelievers of the Orthodox Eastern Catholic
Church The influence of this man and of his Academy on Russia was
immense The earliest schoolbooks were here composed Peter Moghlas
own Shorter Catechism is still referred to The Slavonic grammar and
lexicon of Lavrnty ZiznieTustanvsky and Melnty Smotrtzky continued
in use until supplanted by those of Lomonsoff one hundred and fifty
years later The most important factor next to the foundation of the
famous Academy was that towards the middle of the seventeenth century
learned Kievlyanins like Simen Poltzky attained to the highest
ecclesiastical rank in the country and imported the new ideas in
education which had been evolved in Keff to Moscow where they
prepared the first stable foundations for the future sweeping reforms of
Peter the Great

Literature continued to bear an ecclesiastical imprint but there were
some works of a different sort One of the compositions which presents a
picture of life in the seventeenth centuryamong the higher and
governing classes only it is trueis Grigry Kotoshkins Concerning
Russia in the Reign of Alexi Mikhilovitch Kotoshkin was well
qualified to deal with the subject having been secretary in the foreign
office and attached to the service of Voevda field marshal Prince
Dolgorky in  Among other things he points out that the
women of the kingdom of Moscow are illiterate and deduces the
conclusion that the chief cause of all contemporary troubles in the
kingdom is excessive ignorance He declares We must learn from
foreigners and send our children abroad for instructionprecisely
Peter the Greats policy it will be observed

Another writer Yry Krizhnitz must have exerted a very considerable
influence upon Peter the Great as it is known that the latter owned his
work on The Kingdom of Russia in the Middle of the Seventeenth
Century This book contains a discussion as to the proper means for
changing the condition of affairs then prevailing as to the degree in
which foreign influence should be permitted and precisely what measures
should be adopted to combat this or that social abuse or defect The
programme of reforms which he therein laid down was to proceed from
the highest source by administrative process and without regard to the
opposition of the masses This programme Peter the Great carried out
most effectually later on

Battle was also waged with the old order of things in the spiritual
realm by the famous Patriarch Nkon  who as a peasant lad
of twelve ran away from his fathers house to a monastery Although
compelled by his parents to return home and to marry he soon went back
and became a monk in a monastery in the White Sea Eventually he rose
not only to the highest ecclesiastical post in the kingdom but became
almost more powerful than the Tzar himself He may be classed with the
great literary forces of the land in that he caused the correction of
the Slavonic Church Servicebooks directly from the Greek originals and
eliminated from them innumerable and gross errors which the
carelessness and ignorance of scribes and proofreaders had allowed to
creep into them The farreaching effects of this necessary and
important step the resulting schism in the church which still endures
Nkons quarrels with the Tzar Alexi Mikhilovitch Peter the Greats
father are familiar matters of history as is also the fact that the
power he won and the course he held were the decisive factors in Peter
the Greats resolve to have no more Patriarchs and to intrust the
government of the church to a College now the Most Holy Governing
Synod

When Nkon passed from power lesser men took up the battle Chief among
these was Archimandrite Simen Poltzky already mentioned who lived
from  and was the first learned man to become tutor to a
Tzarvitch The spirit of the times no longer permitted the heir to the
throne to be taught merely to read and write from the primer the
Psalter and the Book of Hours and Alexi Mikhilovitch appointed
Simen Poltzky instructor to the Tzarvitch Fedor

CHAPTER V

FOURTH PERIOD FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY TO THE EPOCH
OF REFORM UNDER PETER THE GREAT


Even in faraway northeastern Russia a break is apparent in the middle
of the sixteenth century and during the reign of Ivn the Terrible a
new sort of historical composition came into voguethe socalled
Stpennaya Knga or Book of Degrees or steps wherein the
national history was set forth in order according to the Degrees of the
Princely Houses in the lines of descent from Rrik to Ivn the Terrible
in twenty degrees This method found favor and another degree was added
in the seventeenth century bringing the history down to the death of
the Tzar Alexi Mikhilovitch During the seventeenth century many
attempts were made at collections and chronicles the only one
approaching fullness being the Chronicle of Nkon socalled
probably because it was compiled by order of the Patriarch Nkon

During the seventeenth century a fad also sprang up of writing
everything even schoolbooks petitions and calendars in versified
form which was known as vrshi and imported from Poland to Moscow by
Simen Poltzky At that time also it was the fashion for schoolboys
to act plays as a part of their regular course of study in the schools
in southwest Russia and in particular in Peter Moghlas Academy in
Keff Plays of a religious character had naturally been imported
from western Europe through Poland in the seventeenth century but as
early as the beginning of the sixteenth century certain church
ceremonies in Russia were celebrated in a purely dramatic form
suggestive of the mystery plays in western Europe The most curious and
famous of these was that which represented the casting of the Three Holy
Children into the Fiery Furnace and their miraculous rescue from the
flames by an angel This was enacted on the Wednesday before Christmas
during Matins in Moscow and other towns the first performance so far
as is known having been in the beginning of the sixteenth century it
being mentioned in the year  in the financebooks of the
archiepiscopal residence of St Sophia at Nvgorod The furnace was a
circular structure of wood on architectural lines gayly painted with
the figures of appropriate holy men specimens have been preserved one
being in the Archeological Museum in St Petersburg

The second famous Act for such was their title was known under the
name of The Riding on the Foal of an Ass and took place beginning
with the end of the sixteenth century in Moscow and other towns
generally on Palm Sunday It represented the triumphal entry of Christ
into Jerusalem and in Moscow it was performed in accordance with a
special ritual by the Patriarch in the presence of the Tzar himself
the Patriarch represented Christ the Tzar led the ass upon which he was
mounted In other towns it was acted by the archbishops and the
Voevdas The third and simplest of these religious dramas the Act
of the Last Judgment generally took place on the Sunday preceding the
Carnival

In  Tzar Alexi Mikhilovitch ordered Johann Gregory the Lutheran
pastor in Moscow to arrange comedy acts and the first pieces acted
before the Tzar on a private court stage were translations from the
Germanthe Act of Artaxerxes the comedy Judith and so forth But
under the influence of southwestern Russia as already mentioned it was
not long before a Russian mystery play St Alexi the Man of God
founded on a Polish original thoroughly imbued with Polish influence
was written in honor of Tzar Alexi and acted in public by students of
Peter Moghlas College in Keff A whole series of mystery plays
followed from the fruitful pen of Simen Poltzky Especially curious
was his Comedy of King Nebuchadnezzar the Golden Calf and the Three
Youths Who Were Not Consumed in the Fiery Furnace He wrote many other
comedies two huge volumes of them

Theatrical representations won instant favor with the Tzar and his
court and a theatrical school was promptly established in Moscow even
before the famous and very necessary SlavonicGrecoLatin Academy for
higher education as it was then understood

None of the school dramasseveral of which Peter Moghla himself is
said to have writtenhave come down to us neither are there any
specimens now in existence of the spiritual dramas and dramatic
dialogues from the early years of the seventeenth century In addition
to the dramas of Simen Poltzky of the last part of that century we
have the dramatic works of another ecclesiastical writer St Dmtry of
Rostff  six in all including The Birth of Christ The
Penitent Sinner Esther and Ahashuerus and so forth They stand
halfway between mysteries and religioallegorical pieces and begin
with a prologue in which one of the actors sketches the general outline
of the piece and explains its connection with contemporary affairs and
end with an epilogue recited by another actor which is a reinforcement
and inculcation of the moral set forth in the play St Dmtrys plays
were first acted in the crosschamber or banquethall of the
episcopal residence in Rostff where he was the Metropolitan by the
pupils of the school he had founded He cleverly introduced scenes from
real life into the middle of his spiritual dramas

Collections of short stories and anecdotes current in western Europe
also made their way to Russia via Poland and freed from puritanical
religious and conventional bonds light satirical treatment of topics
began to be met with in the seventeenth century wherein among other
things ridiculed are the lawcourts the interminable length of
lawsuits the covetousness and injustice of the judges and so forth
Among such productions are The Tale of Judge Shemyk Herring The

CHAPTER VI

FIFTH PERIOD THE REIGN OF PETER THE GREAT 


The Fifth Period of Russian literature is that which comprises the reign
of Peter the Great with its reforms scientific aims and utter change
of views upon nearly all conceivable practical and spiritual subjects
With the general historical aspects of that reign we cannot deal here
The culture which Peter I introduced into Russia was purely
utilitarian and moreover in precisely that degree which would further
the attainment of his ends But however imperatively his attention was
engaged with other matters he never neglected to maintain and add to
the institutions of general education and special schools and to order
the translation of such works as were adapted to the requirements of his
people as he understood those requirements

His views on the subject of literature were as peculiar as those on
culture and were guided by the same sternly practical considerations
But it must be said that under him the printingpress first acquired in
Russia its proper position of importance and became the instrument for
the quick easy and universal dissemination and exchange of thought
instead of serving merely as an indifferent substitute for manuscript
copies Not only were books printed but also speeches and official
poetry for special occasions and at last the Russian News January
 the first Russian newspaper keenly and carefully supervised by
Peter the Great himself made its appearance

At the end of the seventeenth century only two typographical
establishments existed in all Russia one in the Keff Catacombs
Monastery which does an immense business in religious books and cheap
prints and paper ikni or holy pictures the other in Moscow in the
PrintingHouse In  the first typographical establishment appeared
in St Petersburg and in  there were already four in the new
capital in addition to new ones in Tcherngoff NvgorodSyversk and
Nvgorod while another had been added in Moscow Yet Peter the Great
distrusted the literary activity of the monksand with reason since
most of them opposed his reforms while many deliberately plotted
against himand in  ordered that monks in the monasteries
should be deprived of pens ink and paper

His official machinemade literature offers nothing of special
interest But one of the curious phenomena of the epoch was the peasant
writer Ivn Tikhonvitch Posshkoff born about  a welltodo
even a rich man for those days very well read and imbued with the
spirit of reform Out of pure love for his fatherland he began to write
projects and books in which he endeavored to direct the attention of the
government to many social defects and to point out means for correcting
them One of the most interesting works of Peter the Greats period was
Posshkoffs written Plan of Conduct for his son who was one of the
first young Russians sent abroad in  for education entitled A
Fathers Testamentary Exhortation His Book on Poverty and Wealth is
also noteworthy inasmuch as it affords a complete survey of Russia
under Peter the Great

During this reign the highly educated and eminently practical Little
Russians acquired more power than ever The most notable of them all was
Feofn Prokpovitch Archbishop of Nvgorod born in Keff  who
had been brilliantly educated in Keff and Rome and was the most
celebrated of Peter the Greats colaborers the most zealous and clever
executor of his sovereigns will who attained to the highest secular
and ecclesiastical honors and prolonged his influence and his labors
into succeeding reigns His sermons were considered so important that
they were always printed immediately after their delivery and forwarded
to the Emperor abroad or wherever he might chance to be Like others at
that period he indulged in dramatic writing for acting on the school
stage and at Peter the Greats request he drew up a set of
Ecclesiastical Regulations for the Ecclesiastical College and was
appointed to be the head of the church government though Stepn
Yavrsky was made head of the Holy Governing Synod when it was
established in 

Peter the Greats ideas were not only opposed but persecuted after his
death  until the accession to the throne of his daughter
Elizabeth in  It was a long time before literature was regarded
seriously on its own merits before literary and scientific activity
were looked upon as separate departments or any importance was
attributed to literature Science usurped the first place and
literature was regarded as merely a useful accessory thereto This view
was held by all the first writers after Peter the Greats time
Kantemr Tatshtcheff Trediakvsky and even the gifted Lomonsoff
Russias first secular writers in the present sense of that word

The first of these in order Prince Antikh Dmtrievitch Kantemr was
born in  and brought to Moscow at the age of three by his father
the Hospodr of Moldavia after the disastrous campaign on the Pruth
who assumed Russian citizenship Prince Kantemr published his first
work A Symphony concordance of the Psalter at the age of eighteen
being at that time in the military service and a member of Feofn
Prokpovitchs circle and his close friend His father had left a will
by which he bequeathed his entire estate and about one hundred thousand
serfs to that one of his children who should prove the most successful
in the sciences and one of Prince Antikhs brothers having married a
daughter of Prince D M Galtzyn one of the most influential men of
the day Peter the Great naturally adjudged him the heir to the estate
This embittered Prince Antikh Kantemr and he revealed his wrath
against the Emperor and his party in his first two notable satires
which appeared about the time the Empress Anna Ionnovna ascended the
throne  Galtzyn was one of the nobles who were ruined by this
event and Prince Kantemr recovered a portion of his rightful
possessions In  his powerful protection secured him the appointment
of diplomatic resident in London Thence he was later on transferred
to Paris and never returned to Russia Before his departure to London
he wrote five satires several fables and epistles none of which were
printed however though they won him great reputation in cultivated
society where they circulated in manuscript copies Satire was quite in
the spirit of the age and Kantemr devoted himself to it He displayed
much wit and keen observation In all he produced nine satires four
being written during his sojourn abroad In Satire Second entitled
Filart and Evgny or On the Envy and Pride of Cantankerous Nobles
he describes the arrogance of the nobility and their pretensions to the
highest posts without any personal exertion or merit solely on the
merits of their ancestors and here he appears as a zealous advocate of
Peter the Greats Table of Ranks intended to put a stop to precisely
this state of affairs by making rank depend on personal services to the
state The Third and Sixth Satires are curious in that they clearly
express the authors views on his own literary activity and also on
society and literature in general The Sixth Satire written in  is
the most important as showing Kantemrs own nature both as a man and
as a writer

One of the men most in sympathy with Peter the Great was Vasly
Niktitch Tatshtcheff  who was educated partly in Russia
partly abroad He applied his brilliant talents and profound mind to the
public service first in the Artillery then in the Department of Mines
later on as Governor of strakhan In pursuance of a general plan for
useful literary labors Tatshtcheff collected materials for a
geography which he did not finish and for a history of Russia which
he worked out with considerable fullness in five volumes It was
published thirty years after his death by command of Katherine II It
is not history in the sense of that word at the present day but merely
a very respectable preliminary study of materials and the authors
expressions of opinion are valuable features as setting forth the
spirit of the Epoch of Reformation He is generally mentioned as a
historian but far more important are his Spiritual Testament Last
Will and Exhortation to his son Evgrff  and A Discussion
between Two Friends as to the Advantages of Sciences and Schools
probably written  The Testament consists of a general
collection of rules concerning worldly wisdom applied to contemporary
needs and views though his son was already grown up and in the
government service so that much of its contents are of general
application only and were introduced to round out the work and for the
edification of the rising generation It is the last specimen of a class
of works in which as has been seen Russian literature is rich

The first Russian who devoted himself exclusively to literature was
Vasly Kirllovitch Trediakvsky born at strakhan in  the son
and grandson of priests who was educated in Russia and abroad When he
decided on his return from abroad in  to adopt literature as a
profession the times were extremely unpropitious He had long before
during his student days in Moscow written syllabic verses an elegy on
the death of Peter the Great and a couple of dramas which were acted
by his fellowstudents In  he became the court poet or laureate
and panegyrist and wrote to the order of the Empress Anna Ionnovna
speeches and laudatory addresses which he presented to the grandees
receiving in return various gifts in accordance with the custom of the
epoch But neither his official post nor his personal dignity prevented
his receiving also violent and ignominious treatment at the hands of
the powerful nobles His New and Brief Method of Composing Russian
Verses constituted an epoch in the history of Russian poetry since
therein was first set forth the theory of Russian tonic versification
But although he endeavored to create a distinct Russian style and to
put his own system into practice he wrote worse than many of his
contemporaries and his poems were all below mediocrity while not a
single line of them supported the theory he announced They enjoy as
little consideration from his literary posterity as he enjoyed
personally in the society of Anna Ionnovnas day Yet his work was very
prominent in the transition period between the literature of the
seventeenth century and the labors of Lomonsoff and he undoubtedly
rendered a great service to Russian culture by his translations as an
authority on literary theories and as a philologist

The first writer of capital importance in modern Russian literature in
general was the gifted peasantacademician Mikhil Vaslievitch
Lomonsoff a combination of the scientific and literary
man such as was the fashion of the period in general and almost
necessarily so in Russia Born in a village of the Archngel Government
near Kholmogry on the White Sea he was a fisherman like his father
until the age of sixteen having learned to read and write from a
peasant neighbor A tyrannical stepmother forced him to endure hunger
and cold and to do his modest studying and reading in desert spots
Accordingly when he obtained from the village authorities the
permission requisite for absenting himself for the space of ten months
he failed to return and was inscribed among the fugitives In the
SlavoGrecoLatin Academy at Moscow which he managed to enter and
where he remained for five years he distanced all competitors though
he lived as he said in incredible poverty on three kopeks a day
devoting himself chiefly to the natural sciences At the age of
twentytwo he was sent abroad by the government to study metallurgy at
Freiburg There and elsewhere abroad in England France and Holland
he remained for five years studying various practical branches

In  he became assistant professor at the Academy of Science in St
Petersburg at a wretched salary and in  professor lecturing on
physical geography chemistry natural history poetry and the Russian
language He also was indefatigable in translating scientific works from
the French and German in writing a work on mining a rhetoricbook and
so forth By  he had written many odes poetical epistles idyls
and the like verses on festival occasions and tragedies to order a
Russian grammar and had collected materials for a history and planned
extensive philological researches Eager to benefit his country and
conscious that he was capable of doing so he made practical application
of many important improvements in architecture navigation mining and
manufacturing industries For example in  he zealously engaged in
the manufacture of glass with the aid of the government set up a
glassfactory and applied his chemical knowledge to colored glass for
mosaics The great mosaic pictures which glorify Peter the Great and
the vast magnificent ikni holy pictures which adorn the Cathedral
of St Isaac of Dalmatia in St Petersburg are the products of those
factories which still exist and thrive

It is impossible to narrate in detail all Lomonsoffs enterprises for
the improvement of the economic condition of the masses his government
surveys of Russia ethnographical and geographical aims and the like
His administrative labors absorbed most of his time leaving little for
literary work Like others of his day he regarded literature as an
occupation for a mans leisure hours and even openly ridiculed those
who busied themselves exclusively with it though he ascribed to it
great subsidiary importance as a convenient instrument for introducing
to society new ideas and for expounding divers truths both abstract
and scientific Thus he strove to furnish Russia with models of literary
productions in all classes and to improve the language of literature
and science Nevertheless although he rendered great services in these
directions and is known as the Father of Russian Literature he was
far more important as a scientific than as a literary man It is true
that precisely the opposite view of him was held during the period
immediately succeeding him and he became an authority and a pattern for
many Russian writers who imitated his pseudoclassical poetry and even
copied his language as the acme of literary perfection In reality
although he acquired a certain technical skill he was a very mediocre
poet yet he was as an eagle among barnyard fowls and cleverly made use
of the remarkable possibilities of the Russian language as no other man
did although he borrowed his models from the pseudoclassical
productions then in vogue in foreign countries A few of his versified
efforts which have come down to us deserve the name of poetry by virtue
of their lofty thoughts and strong sincere feeling expressed in
graceful melodious style Among the best of these are A Letter
Concerning the Utility of Glass Meditations Concerning the Grandeur
of God and his triumphal ode On the Day of the Accession to the
Throne of the Empress Elizavta Petrvnathis last being the
expression of the general rapture at the accession of Peter the Greats
daughter

The most important feature of all Lomonsoffs poetical productions is
the fine melodious language which was a complete novelty at that time
together with smooth regular versification Not one of his
contemporaries possessed so profound and varied a knowledge of the
Russian popular and book languages and this knowledge it was which
enabled him to make such a wide choice between the ancient Church
Slavonic ancient Russian the popular and the bookish tongues

In Peter the Greats Epoch of Reform the modern secular or civil
alphabet was substituted for the ancient Church Slavonic and the modern
Russian language which Lomonsoff did so much to improve began to
assume shape literature and science at last freeing themselves
completely from ecclesiasticism and monasticism

The first writer to divorce literature and science like Lomonsoff a
talent of the transition period between the Epoch of Reform and the
brilliant era of Katherine IIa product in education and culture of
the Reform Epoch though he strove to escape from its traditionswas
Alexander Petrvitch Sumarkoff  Insignificant in comparison
with Lomonsoff the most complete contrast with the peasantgenius by
his birth and social rank which were of the highest he was plainly the
forerunner of a new era and in the sense in which Feofn Prokpovitch
is called the first secular Russian writer Sumarkoff must be
described as the first Russian literary man

The Empress Anna Ionnovna had had a troop of Italian actors early in
her reign and in  a troop of actors and singers The Empress
Elizavta Petrvna revived the theater and during her reign there were
even two troops of actors one French the other Italian for ballet and
operabouffe  both subsidized by the court Sometimes an audience
was lacking at their performances and on one occasion at least
Elizavta Petrvna improved upon the Scripture parable when an
insufficient number of spectators presented themselves at the French
comedy she forthwith dispatched mounted messengers to numerous persons
of rank and distinction with a categorical demand to know why they had
absented themselves and a warning that henceforth a fine of fifty
rubles would be exacted for such dereliction of duty

A distinctive feature of Elizavtas reign was the growth of closer
relations with France which at this period represented the highest
culture of Europe Dutch and German influences which had hitherto
impressed themselves upon Russian society now gave place to French
ideas Translations of the French classics of the brilliant age of Louis
XIV were made in Russian and the new Academy of Fine Arts established
by Elizavta in St Petersburg was put under the care of French masters
It was in her reign also that the University of Moscow was founded

In  Fedor Grigrievitch Vlkhoff the son of a merchant built in
Yaroslvl on the upper Volga the first Russian theater to hold about
one thousand spectators Five years later the news of the fine
performances of the actors and actresses of Vlkhoffs theater reached
St Petersburg and the troop was ordered to appear before the court
Four years later still the existence of the Russian theater was
assured by imperial decree Sumarkoff was appointed the director
having evidently for a long time previously had full charge of all
dramatic performances at court and also evidently been expected to
furnish plays His first tragedy Khreff dates from  In the
following year Hamlet appeared Until the arrival of the Vlkhoff
troop all his plays were acted in St Petersburg only by the cadets
and officers of the Nobles Cadet Corps where he himself had been
educated Towards the end of Elizavta Petrvnas reign Sumarkoff
acquired great renown almost equaling that of Lomonsoff in his
literary services and the admirers of Russian literature of that day
were divided into hostile camps which consisted of the friends and
advocates of these two writers the Empress Elizabeth being at the head
of the first the Empress Katherine II then Grand Duchess at the head
of the second

For about ten years  Sumarkoff published a satirical
journal The Industrious Bee after which he returned to his real
field and wrote a tragedy Vsheslaff and the comedies A Dowry by
Deceit The Usurer The Three Rival Brothers The Malignant Man
and Narcissus In all he wrote twentysix plays including the
tragedies Snav and Trvor Aristona and Semira before the
establishment of the theater in St Petersburg in addition to Khreff
and Hamlet Dmtry the Pretender and Mstslaff Semira was
regarded as his masterpiece and among his comedies Tressotinius
attracted the most attention All these however were merely weak
imitations of the narrow form in which all French and pseudoclassical
dramas were molded the unities of time place and action exerting an
embarrassing restriction on the action and the heroes although they
professed to be Russians with obscure historical names like Snav and
Trvor or semimythical like Khreff or genuinely historical like
Dmtry the Pretender were the stereotyped declaimers of the bombastic
pseudoclassical drama

Sumarkoffs dramatic work formed but a small part of his writings
which included a great mass of odes eclogues elegies ballads and so
forth and although he ranks as a dramatist he is most important in his
series of fables epigrams and epitaphs which are permeated with
biting satire on his own period though the subjects are rather
monotonousthe bad arrangement of the courts of justice which
permitted bribery and other abuses among lawyers the injurious and
oppressive state monopolies attempts at senseless imitations of
foreigners in language and customs and ignorance concealed by external
polish and culture Coarse and imperfect as are these satires they
vividly reproduce the impressions of a contemporary gifted with keen
observation and the ability to deal dispassionately with current events
As we shall see later on this protest against the existing order of
things continued and blossomed forth in the succeedingthe
sixthperiod of literature in productions which not only form the
flower of the century but also really belong to modern literature and
hold the public attention at the present day This Sumarkoffs dramatic
and other works do not do and their place is rather in the archives of
the preparatory school

CHAPTER VII

SIXTH PERIOD THE REIGN OF KATHERINE II 


Under the brilliant sway of Katherine II  literature and
literary men in Russia first began to acquire legitimate respect and
consideration in the highest circlesthe educated minority which ruled
tastes and fashions Wealthy patrons of literature had existed even in
the Empress Elizabeths day it is true and a taste for the theater had
been implanted or engendered partly by force as we have seen Western
ideas had made much progress in a normal way through the close contact
with western European nations brought about by Elizabeths great
political genius which had made St Petersburg the diplomatic center
and lawgiver and Katherines own interest in literature before her
accession to the throne had also had much to do with raising the
standard and the respect in which literature and writers were held and
in preparing the ground for the new era During her reign life and
literature may be said to have come into close contact for the first
time Katherine II herself may be placed at the head of the writers of
her day in virtue not only of her rank and her encouragement of
literature at home and abroad but because of her own writings One of
her comedies O Ye Times O Ye Manners is still occasionally given
on the stage Her own Memoirs and her Correspondence with Voltaire
Diderot and others furnish invaluable pictures of contemporary views
and manners Her satires comedies and journalistic work and polemical
articles are most important however because most original In  she
began to publish a newspaper called All Sorts of Things or
Varieties to which she personally contributed satirical articles
attacking abuseschiefly the lack of culture and superficiality of
education It was extremely popular with the public and imitators
started up which the Empress eventually suppressed because of their
virulent attacks on her own journal She ceased journalistic work in
 and then introduced on the stage in her comedies the same types
and aspects of Russian life which she had previously presented in her
satirical articles

Of the fourteen comedies nine operas and seven proverbs which she
wrote in whole or in part she had the skeletons of some filled out
with choruses and verses according to her own plans up to  eleven
comedies seven operas and five proverbs have come down to us The
comedies are not particularly artistic but they are important in a
history of the national literature as noteworthy efforts to present
scenes and persons drawn from contemporary lifethe first of that sort
on the Russian stagethe most remarkable being the one already referred
to and The Gamblers Nameday  The personages whom she copied
straight from life are vivid those whom she invented as ideals as
foils for contrast are lifeless shadows Her operas are not important
Towards the close of her literary activity she once more engaged in
journalism writing a series of satirical sketches Facts and Fiction
published in  for a new journal issued on behalf of the Academy
of Sciences by the Princess Dshkoff the director of that academy and
chairman of the Russian Academy founded in that year on the Princesss
own plan

This Princess Ekaterna Romnovna Dshkoff born Vorontzff 
was a brilliantly educated woman with a pronounced taste for political
intrigue who had a great share in the conspiracy which disposed of
Peter III and placed Katherine II on the throne Katherine richly
rewarded the Princess but preserved her own independence and supremacy
which offended Princess Dshkoff the result being a coldness between
the former intimate friends This in turn obliged the Princess to
leave the court and travel at home and abroad During one trip abroad
she received a diploma as doctor of laws medicine and theology from
Edinburg University Her Memoirs are famous though not particularly
frank or in agreement with Katherine IIs statements naturally The
Empress never ceased to be suspicious of her but twenty years later a
truce was patched up between them and Katherine appointed her to the
offices above mentionednever held before or since by a woman

Princess Dshkoff wrote much on educational subjects and in the journal
referred to above she published not only her own articles and Katherine
IIs but also the writings of many new and talented men among them
Von Vzin and Derzhvin This journal The Companion of the Friends of
the Russian Language speedily came to an end when the Princesseditor
took umbrage at the ridicule heaped on some of her projects and speeches
by the Empress and her courtiers

If Katherine II was the first to introduce real life on the Russian
stage Von Vzin was the first to do so in a manner sufficiently
artistic to hold the stage which is the case with his Ndorosl or
The Hobbledehoy He is the representative of the Russian type in its
best aspects during the reign of Katherine II and offers a striking
contrast to the majority of his educated fellowcountrymen of the day
They were slavish worshipers of French influences He bore himself
scornfully even harshly towards everything foreign and always strove
to counteract each foreign thing by something of native Russian origin

Dens Ivnovitch Von Vzin  as his name suggests was the
descendant of an ancient German family of knightly rank An ancestor
had been taken prisoner in the reign of Ivn the Terrible and had ended
by settling in Russia and assuming Russian citizenship The family
became thoroughly Russified when they joined the Russian Church Von
Vzin was of a noble and independent character to which he added a
keen fine mind and a caustic tongue His father he tells us in his
A Frank Confession of Deeds and Thoughts imitated from Rousseaus
Confession was also of an independent character in general and in
particularcontrary to the custom of the epochdetested extortion and
bribery and never accepted gifts Sir he was accustomed to say to
persons who asked favors of him in his official position a loaf of
sugar affords no reason for condemning your opponent please take it
away and bring legal proof of your rights

Dens Von Vzin received a thorough Russian education at homewhich was
unusual at that era of overwhelming foreign influence and his
inclination for literature having manifested itself in his early youth
while still at the University School for Nobles he made various
translations from foreign languages before entering the Moscow
University at the age of fifteen During a visit which he made to St
Petersburg while still a student at the University he saw the theater
for the first time and soon made acquaintance with F G Vlkhoff
already mentioned and one of the actors These things exerted a great
influence upon him During a visit of the Court to Moscow in  he
was appointed translator to the Foreign College Office with the
inevitable military rank and went to live in the new capital After
divers vicissitudes of service he wrote The Brigadier which he was
promptly asked to read before royalty and in society It won for him
great reputation with people who were capable of appreciating the first
play which was genuinely Russian in something more than externals It
jeers at ignorance coated over with an extremely thin veneer of
pretentious foreign culture The types in The Brigadier written about
 had long been floating about in literature and as it were
awaiting a skillful pen which should present them in full relief to the
contemporary public Von Vzin set forth these types on the stage in a
clearer more vivid manner than all previous writers who had dealt with
them as we have seen in satires and dramas from Kantemr to Katherine
II The characters as Von Vzin depicted them were no longer abstract
monsters agglomerations of evil qualities but near relations to
everybody Moreover the drama was gay playfulnot even the moral was
gloomywith not a single depressing line

Totally different is The Hobbledehoy Ndorosl  which is even
more celebrated and was written towards the close of a long career in
the service filled with varied and trying experiencespart of which
arose from the difficulties of the authors own noble character in
contact with a different type of men and from his attacks on abuses of
all sortsafter a profound study of life in the middle and higher
classes of Russian court and diplomatic circles The difference between
The Brigadier and The Hobbledehoy is so great that they must be read
in the order of their production if the full value of the impression
created by the earlier play is to be appreciated The Hobbledehoy was
wholly unlike anything which had been seen hitherto in Russian
literature Had the authorities permitted Von Vzin to print his
collection of satires he would have stood at the head of that branch of
literature in that epoch as it was this fine comedy contains the
fullest expression of his dissatisfaction at the established order of
things in general The merits of the play rest upon its queer characters
from life who are startlingly real and represent the genuine aims and
ideas of the time The contrasting set of characters whom he introduced
as the exponents of his ideals do not express any aims and ideas which
then existed but merely what he personally would have liked to see
Katherine II with whose comedies Von Vzins have much in common
always tried to offset her disagreeable real characters by honorable
sensible types also drawn from real life as ideals But Von Vzins
ideal characters are almost hostile in their bearing towards his
characters drawn from real life Altogether Von Vzin must be regarded
as the first independent artistic writer in Russia and therefore
epochmaking just as Feofn Prokpovitch must be rated as the first
Russian secular writer and Sumarkoff as the first Russian literary
man and publicist in the modern meaning of the words It is worth noting
because of a tendency to that sort of thing in later Russian writers
down to the present day that towards the end of his life a stroke of
paralysis in  and other unfortunate circumstances threw Von Vzin
into a gloomy religious state of mind under the influence of which he
judged himself and his works with extreme severity and condemned them
with excessive harshness

The general outline of The Hobbledehoy is as follows Mrs Prostakff
Simpleton a managing woman of ungovernable temper has an only
child Mitrofn the Hobbledehoy aged sixteen She regards him as a
mere child and spoils him accordingly He is in fact childish in
every way deserving his sobriquet and is followed about everywhere by
his old nurse Eremyevna Mr Simpleton has very little to say and
that little chiefly in support of his overbearing wifes assertions
and at her explicit demand She habitually addresses every one except
her son as beast and by other similar epithets She has taken into
her house about six months before the play opens Sophia a fairly
wealthy orphan and a connection of hers by marriage whom she
illtreats to a degree She is on the point of betrothing her to
Skotnin Beastly her brother who frankly admits that he cares
nothing for the girl and not very much for her estate which adjoins
his own but a very great deal for the extremely fine pigs which are
raised on ita passion for pigs which he prefers to men constituting
his chief interest in life Mr Beastly who says that he never goes to
law no matter what losses he may suffer no matter how much his
neighbors injure him because he simply wrings the deficit out of his
peasants and that ends it declares that Sophias pigs for which he
expresses a deadly longing are so huge that there is not one of them
which stood up on its hind legs would not be a whole head taller than
any one of us is eager for the match While this is under discussion
Sophia being entirely ignorant of their intentions the young girl
enters and announces that she has received good news her uncle who
has been in Siberia for several years in quest of fortune and is
supposed to be dead has written to inform her of his speedy arrival
Mrs Simpleton takes the view that he is dead ought to be dead and
roughly tells Sophia that the latter need not try to frighten her into
giving her her liberty and asserts that the letter must be from the
officer who has been in love with her and whom she wishes to marry
Sophia offers her the letter in proof of innocence saying Read it
yourself Read it myself cries Mrs Simpleton no madam thank
God I was not brought up in that way I may receive letters but I
always order some one else to read them whereupon she orders her
husband to read it Her husband gives it up as too difficult and Mr
Beastly on being asked replies I I have never read anything since I
was born my dear sister God has delivered me from that boredom
Prvdin Mr Upright an official charged with inspecting the condition
of the peasants also empowered to put under arrest cruel proprietors
and under guardianship of the state those who have been illtreated
enters and reads the letter to them When Mrs Simpleton learns from it
that Uncle Starodm Oldidea has a large income and that Sophia is to
inherit it she immediately overwhelms Sophia with flattery and
affection and decides to marry her to her precious child Mitrofn
This leads to violent quarrels during the rest of the play between her
and her brother who wants the pigs and to violence from the latter to
Mitrofn who declares that he has long wished to marry and intends to
have Sophia In the mean time a company of soldiers on the march to
Moscow arrives and is quartered in the village while their commanding
officer Mlon a friend of Mr Upright makes his appearance at the
house where to his surprise he finds his ladylove Sophia who
promptly explains to him the situation of affairs

Mitrofn is still under teachers consisting of Vrlman Liar a former
gunner who is supposed to be teaching him French and all the sciences
Tzfirkin Cipherer a retired armysergeant who instructs him in
arithmetic and Kutikin who as his name implies is the son of a
petty ecclesiastic and teaches him reading and writing talking always
in ecclesiastical style interlarded with old ChurchSlavonic words and
phrases He is always doing reviews never advancing to new lessons
and threatens to drown himself if he be not allowed to wed Sophia at
once There is a most amusing lessonscene The teacher of arithmetic
sets him a problem three people walking along the road find three
hundred rubles which they divide equally between them how much does
each one get Mitrofn does the sum on his slate Once three is three
once nothing is nothing once nothing is nothing But his mother
exclaims that if he finds such a sum he must not divide it but keep
it all and that arithmetic which teaches such division is a fool of a
science Another sum is worked out in equally absurd style with equally
intelligent comments from the mother Kutikin then takes his turn and
using a pointer makes Mitrofn repeat after him a ridiculously
appropriate sentence from the Psalms in the Tchasoslff the Book of
Hours or first reader Vrlman enters meddles with everybody in a
strong foreign accent and puts an end to the lessons as quite
unnecessary for the precious boy for which and his arrogance when
Mrs Simpleton and the Hobbledehoy have retired the other teachers
attack him with slate and book

Meanwhile Uncle Starodm has arrived and talks in long paragraphs and
stilted language to Prvdin and Sophia expressing the ideal view of
life conduct service to the state and so forth He as well as
Sophia Prvdin Mlon are quite colorless The Simpletons overwhelm
Starodm with stupid courtesies and Mrs S gets Prvdin to examine
Mitrofn in order to prove to Starodm that her darling child is fit to
be Sophias husband The examination is even more brilliant than the
lesson Mitrofn says that door that is to say the door to that room
is an adjective because it is added or affixed to its place but the
door of the storehouse is a noun because it has been standing off its
hinges for six weeks Further examination reveals the fact that
Vrlmans instruction in history has impressed his pupil with the idea
that the histories stories told by Khavrnya the herdgirl
constitute that science When asked about geography the Hobbledehoy
declares that he does not know what is meant and his mother prompts him
with Eography after asking Prvdin what he said On inquiring
further as to its meaning and its use and on being informed that it is
a description of the earth and its first use is to aid people in
finding their way about she makes the famous speech frequently quoted
Akh good gracious What are the cabmen for then Thats their
business Thats not a science for the nobility All a noble has to do
is to say Drive me to such a place and youre driven whithersoever
you wish Believe me my good sir everything that Mitrofn does not
know is nonsense

Uncle Starodm makes acquaintance with Mlon whose good qualities he
has learned through an old friend and betroths him to Sophia Mrs
Simpleton on learning of this and that Starodm and Sophia are to set
out for Moscow early the next morning arranges to have Mitrofn abduct
Sophia at a still earlier hour and marry her Sophia escapes Mrs
Simpleton raves and threatens to beat to death her servants who have
failed to carry out her plan Prvdin then announces that the government
has ordered him to take charge of the Simpletons house and villages
because of Mrs Ss notorious inhumanity Vrlman whom Starodm
recognizes as a former coachman of his mounts the box and Starodm
Sophia and Mlon set out for Moscow virtue reigning triumphant and
wickedness being properly punishedwhich again is an ideal point of
view

But the man who taken as a whole above all others in the eighteenth
century has depicted for us governmental social and private life is
Gavrl Romnovitch Derzhvin  His memoirs and poetical
chronicle furnish the most brilliant vivid and valuable picture of the
reign of Katherine II Moreover in his own person Derzhvin offers a
type of one of the most distinguished Russians of the last half of the
eighteenth century in his literary and official career He presented a
great contrast to his contemporary and friend Von Vzin in that while
the latter was a noteworthy example of all the best sides in
contemporary social life with very few defects Derzhvin was an
example of all the defects of contemporary life and of several
distinctly personal merits which sharply differentiated him from others
in the same elevated spheres of court and official life He was the son
of a poor noble His opportunities for education were extremely limited
and in  he entered the military service as a common soldier in the
famous Preobrazhnsky Transfiguration infantry regiment of the Guards
As he had neither friends nor relatives in St Petersburg he lived in
barracks where with difficulty he followed his inclinations and read
all the Russian and German books he could obtain scribbling verses at
intervals In  he managed to obtain a small estate and the rank of
bombardierlieutenant and left the service to become an usher in one
department of the Senate where he made many friends and acquaintances
in high circles Eventually he became governor of Olnetz then of
Tambff In  he began in a new style among other compositions
therein being an ode To Felitza meaning the Empress Katherine II He
continued to write verses but published nothing under his own name
until his famous ode God and The Murzas Vision in  We cannot
here enter into his official career further than to say that all his
troubles arose from his own honesty and from the combined hostile
efforts of the persons whose dishonest practices he had opposed Towards
the end of Katherines reign he became a privy councilor a titular
rank and senator that is to say a member of the Supreme Judicial
Court Under Paul I he was President of the Commerce College Ministry
of Commerce and Imperial Treasurer Under Alexander I he was made
Minister of Justice

Katharines Bard as he was called like several of his predecessors
cherished an idea of fixing a style in Russian literature his special
aim being to confine it to the classical style and to oppose the new
school of Karamzn In this he was upheld by I I Dmtrieff who was
looked upon as his successor But after Derzhvin heard Pshkin read his
verses at the examination in the Tzrskoe Sel Lyceum  he
frankly admitted that the lad had already excelled all living writers of
Russia and he predicted that this schoolboy would become the new and
brilliant star

Despite the burdens of his official life Derzhvin wrote a great deal
towards the end of his life much dramatic matter yet he really belongs
to the ranks of the lyric poets He deserved all the fame he enjoyed
because he was the first poet who was so by inspiration not merely by
profession or ambition Even in his most insignificant works of the
stereotyped sort with much sound and very little thought and feeling
the hand of a master is visible and talent is perceptible while many
passages are remarkable for their poetic figures melody of
versification and beauty and force of expression No poet previous to
Pshkin can be compared to him for talent and for direct independent
inspiration His poetry is chiefly the poetry of figures and events of
solemn loudly trumpeted victories and feats descriptions of banquets
festivals noisy social life and endless hymns of praise to the age of
Katherine II It is not very rich in inward contents or in ideas But he
possessed one surpassing merit he first of all among Russian poets
brought poetry down from its lofty classical flights to the everyday
life of his fatherland at that age and to nature and freed Russian
poetry from that monotonous stilted tiresome official form which had
been introduced by Lomonsoff and copied by all the latters followers
Derzhvins language is powerful picturesque and expressive but still
harsh and uneven the ordinary vernacular being mingled with
ChurchSlavonic and frequently obscuring the meaning also and owing
to his deficient education he often had recourse to inelegant
tasteless forms If we compare him with Lomonsoff and Sumarkoff it is
evident that Russian poetry had made a great stride in advance under
him both as to external and internal development in that he not only
brought it nearer to life but also perfected its forms to a
considerable degree and applied it to subjects to which his
predecessors would never have dreamed of applying it His famous ode
God will best serve to illustrate his style

    GOD

    O Thou eternal One whose presence bright
    All space doth occupy all motion guide
    Unchanged through times alldevastating flight
    Thou only God There is no God beside
    Being above all beings Three in One

    There is no weight nor measurenone can mount
    Up to Thy mysteries Reasons brightest spark
    Though kindled by Thy light in vain would try
    To trace Thy counsels infinite and dark
    And thought is lost ere thought can soar so high
    Even like past moments in eternity

    Thou from primeval nothingness didst call
    First chaos then existence Lord on Thee
    Eternity had its foundation all

    Thy chains the unmeasured universe surround
    Upheld by Thee by Thee inspired with breath
    Thou the beginning with the end has bound
    And beautifully mingled life and death
    As sparks mount upwards from the fiery blaze
    So suns are born so worlds spring forth from Thee
    And as the spangles in the sunny rays
    Shine round the silver snow the pageantry
    Of heavens bright army glitters in Thy praise

    A million torches lighted by Thy hand
    Wander unwearied through the blue abyss
    They own Thy power accomplish Thy command
    All gay with life all eloquent with bliss
    What shall we call them Piles of crystal light
    A glorious company of golden streams

    Suns lighting systems with their joyous beams
    But Thou to these art as the noon to night

    Yes as a drop of water in the sea
    All this magnificence in Thee is lost
    What are ten thousand worlds compared to Thee
    And what am I then Heavens unnumberd host

    Just on the boundaries of the spiritland

    God Thus alone my lowly thoughts can soar
    Thus seek Thy presenceBeing wise and good
    Midst Thy vast works admire obey adore
    And when the tongue is eloquent no more
    The soul shall speak in tears of gratitude

But the literary activity of Katherine IIs reign was not confined to
its two most brilliant representativesVon Vzin and Derzhvin many
less prominent writers belonging to different parties and branches of
literature were diligently at work Naturally there was as yet too
little independent Russian literature to permit of the existence of
criticism or the establishment of a fixed standard of taste

Among the worthy writers of the second class in that brilliant era were
Kheraskff Bogdanvitch Khmnitzer and Kpnist

Mikhil Matvyevitch Kheraskff  the author of the epic The
Rossiad and of other less noteworthy works was known during his
lifetime only to the very restricted circle of his friends In his
convictions and views on literature he belonged to the epoch of
Lomonsoff and Sumarkoff by birth and education to the highest
nobility More faithfully than any other writer of his century does
Kheraskff represent the pseudoclassical style in Russian epic lyric
and dramatic poetry for he wrote all sorts of things including
sentimental novels To the classical enthusiasts of his day he seemed
the Russian Homer and his long poems The Rossiad  and
Vladmir  were confidently believed to be immortal being the
first tolerable specimens of the epic style in Russian literature In
twelve long cantos he celebrates the capture of Kazn by Ivn the
Terrible in The Rossiad Vladmir eighteen cantos celebrates the
Christianizing of Russia by PrinceSaint Vladmir

Ippolt Fedorovitch Bogdanvitch  who was developed under
the immediate supervision and patronage of Kheraskff belonged by
education and his comprehension of elegance and of poetry to a later
epochon the borderland between pseudoclassicism and the succeeding
period which was ruled by sentimentalism His wellknown poem
Dshenka Dear Little Soul was the first light epic Russian poem
with simple intelligible language and with a jesting treatment of a
gay playful subject This subject Bogdanvitch borrowed from La
Fontaines novel The Loves of Psyche and Cupid which in turn was
borrowed from Apuleius

The third writer of this group Ivn Ivnovitch Khmnitzer 
the son of a German physician was unknown during his lifetime enjoyed
no literary fame and cared for none regarding his capacities and
productions as unworthy of notice In  at the instigation of his
friends he published a collection of his Fables and Tales At this
time there existed not a single tolerable specimen of the fable in
Russian but by the time literary criticism did justice to Khmnitzers
work Karamzn and Dmtrieff had become the favorites of the public
and Khmnitzers productions circulated chiefly among the lower classes
for whom his Fables are still published His works certainly aided
Dmtrieff and Krylff in handling this new branch of poetical literature
in Russia His The Metaphysician still remains one of the greatest
favorites among Russian fables for cultivated readers of all classes

Briefly told the contents of The Metaphysician are as follows A
father who had heard that children were sent beyond sea to be educated
and that those so reared were more respected than those brought up at
home determined being wealthy to send his son thither The son
despite his studies from being stupid when he went returned more
stupid than before having fallen into the clutches of educational
quacks of whom there is no lack Aforetime he had babbled stupidities
simply but now he began to expound such things in learned wise
aforetime only the stupid had failed to understand him now he was
beyond the comprehension of the wise The whole house and town and
world were bored to death with his chatter He was possessed with a
mania for searching out the cause of everything With his wits thus
woolgathering as he walked he one day suddenly tumbled into a pit His
father who chanced to be with him rushed off to get a rope wherewith
to drag out his household wisdom Meanwhile his thoughtful child as
he sat in the pit reasoned with himself as to what might be the cause
of his fall and came to the conclusion that it was an earthquake also
that his sudden flight into the pit might create an atmospheric
pressure from the earth and the pit which would wipe out the seven
planets The father rushed up with a rope Heres a rope for you says
he catch hold of it Ill drag you out look out that you dont fall
off No wait dont pull me out yet tell me first what sort of a
thing is a rope Although the father was not learned he was gifted by
nature with common sense winds up the fable

Another called The Skinflint runs thus

    There was once a Skinflint who had a vast amount of money
    And as he was wont to say he had grown rich
    Not by crooked deeds Not by stealing or ruining men
    No he took his oath to that That God had sent all this wealth to
            his house
    And that he feared not in the least to be convicted of injustice
            towards his neighbor
    And to please the Lord for this His mercy
    And to incline Him unto favors in time to come
    Or possibly just to soothe his conscience
    The Skinflint took it into his head to build a house for the poor
    The house was built and almost finished My Skinflint gazing at it
    Beside himself with joy cheers up and reasons with himself
    How great a service he to the poor hath rendered in ordering a refuge
            to be built for them
    Thus was my Skinflint inwardly exulting over his house
    Then one of his acquaintances chanced along
    The Skinflint said with rapture to his friend
    I think a great lot of the poor can be housed here
    Of course a great many can live here
    But you cannot get in all whom youve sent wandering homeless oer
            the earth

One of Khmnitzers most intimate friends and also one of the most
notable members of Derzhvins circle being related to the latter
through his wife was Vasly Vaslievitch Kpnist  whose
ancestors had been members of an Italian family the Counts Capnissi He
owed his fame chiefly to his ode on Slavery  to another On
the Extirpation in Russia of the Vocation of Slave by the Empress
Katherine II  and to a whole series celebrating the conquests
of the Russian arms in Turkey and Italy But far more important are his
elegies and short lyrics many of which are really very light and
graceful and his translations of The Monument from Horace which was
quite equal to Derzhvins or even Pshkins His masterpiece was the
comedy Ybeda Calumny which was written probably at the end of
Katherines reign and was printed under Paul I in  It contains a
sharp condemnation of the morals in the provincial courts of justice
and of the incredible processes of chicanery and bribery through which
every business matter was forced to pass The types which Kpnist put on
the stage especially the pettifogger Prvoloff and the types of the
presiding judge and members of the bench were very accurately drawn
and can hardly fail to have been taken from life Alarmed by the
numerous persecutions of literary men which took place during the last
years of Katherine IIs reign Kpnist dared not publish his comedy
until the accession of the Emperor Paul I when he dedicated it to the
Emperor and set forth in a poetical preface the entire harmlessness of
his satire But even this precaution was of no avail The comedy created
a tremendous uproar and outcry from officialdom in general the Emperor
was petitioned to prohibit the piece and to administer severe
punishment to the unpatriotic author The Emperor is said to have
taken the petition in good faith and to have ordered that Kpnist be
dispatched forthwith to Siberia But after dinner his wrath cooled the
petitioners had even declared that the comedy flagrantly jeered at the
monarchical power and he began to doubt the justice of his command He
ordered the piece to be played that very evening in the Hermitage
Theater in the Winter Palace Only he and the Grand Duke Alexander
afterwards Alexander I were present at the performance After the
first act the Emperor who had applauded incessantly sent the first
state courier he could put his hand on to bring Kpnist back on the
instant He richly rewarded the author on the latters return and
showed him favor until he died Another amusing testimony to the
lifelikeness of Kpnists types is narrated by an eyewitness I
happened says this witness in my early youth to be present at a
representation of Calumny in a provincial capital and when Khvatko
Grabber sang

    Take theres no great art in that
    Take whatever you can get
    What are hands appended to us for
    If not that we may take take take

all the spectators began to applaud and many of them addressing the
official who occupied the post corresponding to that of Grabber
shouted his name in unison and cried Thats you Thats you

Towards the end of Katherine IIs reign a new school which numbered
many young writers arose At the head of it by reason of his ability
as a journalist literary man poet and savant stood Nikoli
Mikhilovitch Karamzn  Karamzn was descended from a Tatr
princeling Karamurza who accepted Christianity in the days of the
Tzars of Moscow He did much to disseminate in society a discriminating
taste in literature and more accurate views in regard to it During the
first half of his sixty years activitythat under Katherine IIhe
was a poet and literary man during the latter and most considerable
part of his careerunder Alexander Ihe was a historian His first
work to win him great renown was his Letters of a Russian Traveler
written after a trip lasting a year and a half to Germany Switzerland
France and England begun in  and published in the Moscow
Journal which he established in  For the next twelve years
Karamzn devoted himself exclusively to journalism and literature It
was his most brilliant literary period and during it his labors were
astonishing in quantity and varied in subject as the taste of the
majority of readers in that period demanded During this period he was
not only a journalist but also a poet literary man and critic His
poetical compositions are rather shallow and monotonous in form but
were highly esteemed by his contemporaries They are interesting at the
present day chiefly because of their historical and biographical
details as a chronicle of history and of the heart of a profoundly
sincere man Their themes are generally the love of nature of country
life friendship together with gentleness sensibility melancholy
scorn for rank and wealth dreams of immortality with posterity His
greatest successes with the public were secured by Poor Liza and
Natlya the Boyrs Daughter which served as muchadmired models for
sentimentalism to succeeding generations Sentimentality was no novelty
in Russia it had come in with translations from English novels such as
Richardsons Clarissa Harlowe and the like and imitations of them in
Russia Sensibility was held to be the highest quality in human
nature and a mansmuch more a womansworth was measured by the
amount of sensibility he or she possessed This new school paid scant
heed to the observation and study of real life An essential tenet in
the cult consisted of a glorification of the distant past the good old
times adorned by fancy as the ideal model for the present the
worship of the poor but honest country folk the ideal of equality
freedom happiness and nearness to nature

Of this style Karamzns Poor Liza is the most perfect and admired
specimen Liza a poor country lass is beautiful in body and soul
supremely gifted with tenderness and sensibility Erst a wealthy
noble possessed of exceptional brains and a kind heart but weak and
trifling by nature falls in love with her He begins to dream of the
idyllic past in which people strolled carefree through the meadows
bathed in crystal clear pools kissed like turtledoves reposed amid
roses and myrtle and passed their days in happy idleness So he feels
himself summoned to the embrace of nature and determines to abandon the
high society for a while at least He even goes so far as to assure
Liza that it is possible for him to marry her despite the immense
difference in their social stations that an innocent soul gifted with
sensibility is the most important thing of all and Liza will ever be
the nearest of all persons to his heart But he betrays her
involuntarily When she becomes convinced of his treachery she throws
herself into a pond hard by beneath the ancient oaks which but a short
time before had witnessed their joys

Natlya the Boyrs Daughter is a glorification of a fanciful past
far removed from reality in which Russians were Russians and against
this background Karamzn sets a tale even simpler and more innocent
of the love of Natlya and Alexi with whom Natlya falls in love in
one minute on beholding him for the first time and without ever having
heard a single word about him These stories and Karamzns Letters
of a Russian Traveler already referred to had an astonishing success
people even learned them by heart and the heroes of them became the
favorite ideals of the young while the pool where Liza was represented
as having drowned herself near the Simnoff Monastery in the suburbs
of Moscow became the goal for the rambles of those who were also
gifted with sensibility The appearance of these tales is said to have
greatly increased the taste for reading in society especially among
women

Although Karamzn did not possess the gift of artistic creation and
although the imaginative quality is very deficient in his works his
writings pleased people as the first successful attempts at light
literature In his assumption that people should write as they talked
Karamzn entirely departed from Lomonsoffs canons as to the three
styles permissible and thereby imparted the final impulse to the
separation of the Russian literary language from the bookish
ChurchSlavonic diction His services in the reformation and improvement
of the Russian literary language were very important despite the
violent opposition he encountered from the old conservative literary
party

When Alexander I ascended the throne in  Karamzn turned his
attention to history In  he founded the European Messenger which
is still the leading monthly magazine of Russia and began to publish
in it historical articles which were in effect preparatory to his
extended and famous History of the Russian Empire published in 
fine in style but not accurate in the modern sense of historical work

Karamzns nearest followers the representatives of the sentimental
tendency in literature and of the writers who laid the foundations for
the new literary language and style were Dmtrieff and zeroff

Ivn Ivnovitch Dmtrieff  and Vladislff Alexndrovitch
zeroff  both enjoyed great fame in their day Dmtrieff
while under the guidance of Karamzn making sentimentalism the ruling
feature in Russian epic and lyric poetry perfected both the general
style of Russian verse and the material of the light poetical
language zeroff under the same influence and tendency aided in the
final banishment from the Russian stage of pseudoclassical ideals and
dramatic compositions constructed according to theoretical rules
Dmtrieffs most prominent literary work was a translation of La
Fontaines Fables and some satirical writings zeroff in  put on
the stage his first and not entirely successful tragedy Yropolk and
Olg His most important work both from the literary and the
historical points of viewalthough not so regarded by his
contemporarieswas his drama Fingal founded on Ossians Songs and
is a triumph of northern poetry and of the Russian tongue rich in
picturesqueness daring and melody His contemporaries regarded Dmtry
Donsky as his masterpiece although in reality it is one of the least
noteworthy of his compositions and it enjoyed a brilliant success

But the most extreme and talented disciples of the Karamzn school were
Vasly Andrevitch Zhukvsky  and Konstantn Nikolevitch
Btiushkoff  who offer perfectly clear examples of the
transition from the sentimental to the new romantic school which began
with Pshkin Everything of Zhukvskys that was original that is to
say not translated was an imitation either of the solemn bombastic
productions of the preceding poets of the rhetorical school or of the
tender dreamy melancholy works of the sentimental school until he
devoted himself to translations from the romantic German and English
schools He was not successful in his attempts to create original
Russian work in the romantic vein and his chief services to Russian
literature despite the great figure he played in it during his day
must be regarded as having consisted in giving romanticism a chance to
establish itself firmly on Russian soil and in having by his splendid
translations among them Schillers Maid of Orleans Byrons The
Prisoner of Chillon and de la Mott Fouqus Undine brought Russian
literature into close relations with a whole mass of literary models
enlarged the sphere of literary criticism and definitively deprived
pseudoclassical theories and models of all force and influence

Zhukvskys own history and career were romantic He was the son of a
wealthy landed proprietor named Bnin who already had eleven children
when his peasants on setting out for Rumyntzoffs army as sutlers
asked their owner What shall we bring thee from the Turkish land
little father Bnin replied in jest Bring me a couple of pretty
Turkish lasses you see my wife is growing old The peasants took him
at his word and brought two young Turkish girls who had been captured
at the siege of Bender The elder Salkha aged sixteen first served as
nurse to Bnins daughters In  shortly after seven of his children
had died within a short time of each other she bore him a son who was
adopted by one of his friends a member of the petty nobility Bnins
daughter standing as godmother to the child and his wife receiving it
into the family and rearing it like a son in memory of her dead only
son This baby was the future poet Zhukvsky When Bnin died he
bequeathed money to the child and his widow and daughters gave him the
best of educations Zhukvsky began to print bits of melancholy poetry
while he was still at the university preparatory school When he became
closely acquainted with Karamzn  he came under the latters
influence so strongly that the stamp remained upon all the productions
of the first half of his career the favorite Svyetlna Amaryllis
written in  being a specimen In  Zhukvsky served in the army
and wrote his poem The Bard in the Camp of the Russian Warriors
which brought him more fame than all his previous work being adapted to
the spirit of the time and followed it up with other effusions which
made much more impression on his contemporaries than they have on later
readers But even in his most brilliant period the great defect of
Zhukvskys poetry was a total lack of coloring or close connection with
the Russian soil which he did not understand and did not particularly
love His poetical Epistle to Alexander I after the Capture of Paris
in  he sent in manuscript to the Emperors mother the Empress
Mrya Fedorovna The result was that the Empress ordered it printed in
luxurious style at government expense had him presented to her and
made him her reader He was regarded as a great poet became a close
friend of the imperial family tutor to the Grand Duchess Alexndra
Fedorovna wife of Nikoli Pvlovitch afterwards the Emperor Nicholas
I and his fortune was assured His career during the last twentyfive
years of his life beginning with  belongs to history rather than
to literature In  wealthy loaded with imperial favors richly
pensioned he went abroad and settled in BadenBaden where he married
being at the time sixty years of age while his bride was nineteen
and never returned to Russia During the last eleven years of his
semiinvalid life with disordered nerves he approached very close to
mysticism

Btiushkoff as a poet was the exact opposite of Zhukvsky being the
first to grasp the real significance of the mood of the ancient
classical poets and to appropriate not only their views on life and
enjoyment but even their plastic and thoroughly artistic mode of
expression While Zhukvsky removed poetry from earth and rendered it
ethereal Btiushkoff fixed it to earth and gave it a body
demonstrating all the entrancing charm of tangible reality Yet in
language point of view and literary affiliations he belongs like
Zhukvsky to the school of Karamzn But his versification his
subjectmatter are entirely independent of all preceding influences In
beauty of versification and plastic worth Btiushkoff had no
predecessors in Russian literature and no competitors in the school of
Karamzn He was of ancient noble family well educated and began to
publish at the age of eighteen

We now come chronologically to a writer who cannot be assigned either
to the old sentimental school of Karamzn or to the new romantic school
of which Pshkin was the first and greatest exponent in Russian
literature to a man who stood apart in a lofty place all his own
both during his lifetime and in all Russian literary history whose name
is known to every Russian who can read and write and whose work enjoys
in Russia that popularity which the Odyssey did among the ancient
Greeks Ivn Andrevitch Krylff  began his literary work
almost simultaneously with Karamzn but was not in the slightest
degree influenced by the style which the latter introduced into Russian
literature and bore himself in no less distant and hostile a manner to
the rising romantic school of Pshkin He was the son of an army
officer who was afterwards in the civil service a very competent
intelligent man who left his family in dire poverty at his death At
the age of fifteen Krylff produced his first and very creditable
specimen of his future talent though obliged by extreme need to enter
government service at the age of fourteen at his fathers death He
filled several positions in different places at a very meager salary
until the death of his mother  when he resigned and determined to
devote himself exclusively to literature He engaged in journalistic
work became an editor and soon published a paper of his own But his
real sphere was that of fabulist In  he offered his first three
fables partly translated partly worked over from La Fontaine and from
the moment of their publication his fame as a writer of fables began to
grow But he wrote two comedies and a fairyopera before in  he
finally devoted himself to fables to which branch of literature he
remained faithful as long as he lived By  his fables were so
popular that he was granted a government pension and became a member of
the Empress Mrya Fedorovnas circle of court poets and literary men
From  or later Krylff had an easy post in the Imperial
Public Library and in the course of forty years wrote about two
hundred fables He is known to have been extremely indolent and untidy
but all his admirers and even his enemies recognized in him a power
which not one of his predecessors in the literary sphere had
possesseda power which was thoroughly national bound in the closest
manner to the Russian soil His fables bear an almost family likeness to
the proverbs aphorisms adages and tales produced by the wisdom of the
masses and are quite in their spirit All the Russian poets had tried
their hand at that favorite form of poetic compositionthe fableever
since its introduction from western Europe in the eighteenth century
and Krylffs success called forth innumerable imitators But up to that
time out of all the sorts of poetry existing in Russian literature
only the fable thanks to Krylff had become in full measure the
organ of nationality both in spirit and in language and these two
qualities his fables possess in the most profound national meaning of
the term His language is peculiar to himself He was the first who
dared to speak to Russian society enervated by the harmonious regular
prose of Karamzn in the rather rough vernacular of the masses which
was nevertheless energetic powerful and contained no foreign
admixture or any exclusively bookish elements One of the most popular
of his fables to which allusion is often made in Russian literature and
conversation is Demyns FishSoup The manner in which the lines are
rhymed in the original is indicated by corresponding figures

DEMYNS FISHSOUP

    Neighbor dear my light 
    Eat I pray thee 
    Neighbor dear Im full to the throatNo matter 
    Another little plateful hearken 
    This fish soup I assure you is gloriously cooked 
    Three platefuls have I eatenO stop that why keep count 
    If only you feel like it 
    Why eat and health be yours eat to the bottom 
    What fishsoup and how rich in fat 
    As though with amber covered 
    Enjoy yourself dear friend 
    Heres tender bream pluck a bit of sterlet here
    Just another little spoonful
    Come urge him wife
    In this wise did neighbor Demyn neighbor Fka entertain
    And let him neither breathe nor rest
    But sweat from Fka long had poured in streams
    Yet still another plateful doth he take
    Collects his final strengthand cleans up everything
    Now thats the sort of friend I like
    Demyn did shout But I cant bear the stuckup come eat another
            plateful my dear fellow
    Thereupon my poor Fka
    Much as he loved fishsoup yet from such a fate
    In his arms seizing his girdle and his cap
    Rushed madly quickly home
    And since that day hath never more set foot in Demyns house
    Writer thou art lucky if the real gift thou hast
    But if thou dost not know enough to hold thy peace in time
    And dost not spare thy neighbors ears
    Then must thou know that both thy prose and verse
    To all will prove more loathsome than Demyns fishsoup

Another good specimen is called

THE SWAN THE PIKE AND THE CRAB

    When partners cannot agree their affair will not work smoothly
    And torment not business will be the outcome
    Once on a time the Swan the Crab and the Pike
    Did undertake to haul a loaded cart
    And all three hitched themselves thereto
    They strained their every nerve but still the cart budged not
    And yet the load seemed very light for them
    But towards the clouds the Swan did soar
    Backwards the Crab did march
    While the Pike made for the stream
    Which of them was wrong which right tis not our place to judge
    Only the cart doth stand there still

We have seen that Lomonsoff began the task of rendering the modern
Russian language adaptable to all the needs of prose and verse and that
the writers who followed him notably Karamzn contributed their share
to this great undertaking Pshkin practically completed it and molded
the hitherto somewhat harsh and awkward forms into an exquisite medium
for every requirement of literature Alexnder Sergyevitch Pshkin
 still holds the undisputed leadership for simplicity
realism absolute fidelity to life and he was the first worthy
forerunner of the great men whose names are worldsynonyms at the
present day for those qualities Almost every writer who preceded him
had been more or less devoted to translations and servile copies of
foreign literature Against these and the mockclassicism of the French
pattern which then ruled Europe he waged relentless battle He
vitalized Russian literature by establishing its foundations firmly on
Russian soil by employing her native traditions life and sentiment as
subjects and inspiration in place of the wornout conventionalities of
foreign invention The result is a product of the loftiest truth as
well as of the loftiest art

His ancestors were nobles who occupied important posts under Peter the
Great His mother was a granddaughter of Hannibal the negro of whom
Pshkin wrote under the title of Peter the Greats Arab This Hannibal
was a slave who had been brought from Africa to Constantinople where
the Russian ambassador purchased him and sent him to Peter the Great
The latter took a great fancy to him had him baptized and would not
allow his brothers to ransom him but sent him at the age of eighteen
abroad to be educated On his return Peter kept his favorite always
beside him Under the reign of the Empress Anna Ionnovna he was exiled
to Siberia in company with other court favorites of former reigns and
like them returned to Russia and was loaded with favors by Peters
daughter the Empress Elizabeth His son was a distinguished general of
Katherine IIs day Pshkin the poet had blue eyes and very fair
skin and hair but the whole cast of his countenance in his portraits is
negro His father was a typical society man and in accordance with the
fashion of the day Pshkin was educated exclusively by French tutors at
home and his first writings at the age of ten were in French and
imitated from writers of that nation When his father retired from the
military service he settled in Moscow and the boy knew all the
literary men of that day and town before he was twelve years of age and
there can be no doubt that this literary atmosphere had a great
influence upon him When at the age of twelve he was placed in the
newly founded Lyceum at Tzrskoe Sel sixteen miles from St
Petersburg whence so many famous men were afterwards graduated he and
the other pupils amused themselves in their play hours by writing a
little newspaper and by other literary pursuits Here the lad was
compelled to learn Russian and the first use he made of it was to write
caustic epigrams At the school examination in  the aged poet
Derzhvin was among the visitors and when he heard the boy read his
Memories of Tzrskoe Sel he at once predicted his coming greatness
As is natural at his age there was not much originality of idea in the
poem but it was amazing for its facility and mastery of poetic forms
Karamzn and Zhukvsky were not long in adding their testimony to the
lads genius and the latter even acquired the habit of submitting his
own poems to the young poets judgment

Pshkin was an omnivorous reader but his parents had never been pleased
with his progress in his studies or regarded him as clever The praise
of competent judges now opened their eyes but he had a good deal to
endure from his father later on in spite of this At this period
Pshkin imitated the most varied poetical forms with wonderful delicacy
and yielded to the most diverse poetical moods But even then he was
entering on a new path whose influence on later Russian literature was
destined to be incalculably great While still a schoolboy he began to
write his famous fantasticromantic poem Rusln and Liudmla which
Glnka afterwards made the subject of a charming opera and here for
the first time in Russian literary history a thoroughly national theme
was handled with a freedom and naturalness which dealt the deathblow to
the prevailing inflated rhetorical style The subject of the poem was
one of the folklegends of which he had been fond as a child and when
it was published in  the critics were dumb with amazement The
gay even dissipated society life which he took up on leaving the
Lyceum came to a temporary end in consequence of some biting epigrams
which he wrote The Prefect of St Petersburg called him to account for
his attacks on prominent people and transferred him from the ministry
of foreign affairs to southern Russiain fact to polite exilegiving
him a corresponding position in another department of the government

For four years  he lived chiefly in southern Russia
including the Crimea and the Caucasus and wrote The Prisoner of the
Caucasus The Fountain of Baktchesari The Gypsies and a part of
his famous Evgny Onygin being at this period strongly influenced
by Byron as the abovementioned poems and the short lyrics of the same
period show Again his life and his poetry were changed radically by a
caustic but witty and amusing epigram on his uncongenial official
superior in Odessa and on the latters complaint to headquartersthe
complaint being as neat as the epigram in its wayPshkin was ordered
to reside on one of the paternal estates in the government of Pskoff
Here under the influence of his old nurse Arna Rodinovna and her
folktales he became thoroughly and definitively Russian and entered
at last on his real careerpoetry which was truly national in spirit
His talents were now completely matured His wonderfully developed
harmony of versification has never been approached by any later poet
except in places by Lrmontoff Quite peculiar to himself at that
dayand even much laterare his vivid delineations of character and
his simple but startlingly lifelike and truthful pictures of everyday
life If his claim to immortality rested on no other foundation than
these it would still be incontestable for all previous Russian writers
had scorned such commonplaces

In  he returned to the capital having been restored to favor and
resumed his gay life which on the whole had a deleterious influence on
his talents In  he married a very beautiful and extravagant woman
after which he was constantly in financial distress his own social
ambitions and lavish expenditure being equally well developed with the
same tastes in his wife His inclination to write poetry was destroyed
He took to historical research wrote a History of Pugatchffs
Rebellion and a celebrated tale The Captains Daughter the scene
of the latter being laid in the same epoch and other stories In
these almost simultaneously with Ggol he laid the foundations for the
vivid modern school of the Russian novel He was killed in a duel with
Baron George HekkerenDantes who had been persecuting his wife with
unwelcome attentions in January  Baron HekkerenDantes died only
a year or two ago

As a schoolboy he had instinctively turned into a new path that of
national Russian literature For this national service and because he
was the first to realize the poetic ideal his countrymen adored him To
the highest external elegance and the most exquisite beauty he fitly
wedded inward force and wealth of thought in the most incomparable
manner His finest effort Evgny Onygin  exhibits the
poet in the process of development from the Byronic stage to the
vigorous independence of a purely national writer The hero Evgny
Onygin begins as a society young man of the period that is to say he
was inevitably a Byronic character His fathers death calls him from
the dissipations of the capital to the quiet life of a country estate
He regards his neighbors as his inferiors both in culture and social
standing and for a long time will have nothing to do with them At
last rather accidentally he strikes up a friendship with Lnsky a
congenial spirit a young poet who has had the advantage of foreign
education the son of one of the neighbors Olga Lrin the young
daughter of another neighbor has long been betrothed to Lnsky and the
latter naturally introduces Onygin to her family Olgas elder sister
Tatyna promptly falls in love with Onygin and in a letter which is
always quoted as one of the finest passages in Russian literature and
the most perfect portrait of the noble Russian womans soul she
declares her love for him Onygin politely snubs her lecturing her in
a fatherly way and no one is informed of the occurrence except
Tatynas old nurse who though stupid is absolutely devoted to her
and does not betray the knowledge which she has involuntarily
acquired Not long afterwards Tatynas nameday festival is celebrated
by a dinner at which Onygin is present being urged thereto by Lnsky
He goes chiefly that no comment may arise from any abrupt change of
his ordinary friendly manners The family ignorant of what has happened
between him and Tatyna and innocently scheming to bring them together
place him opposite her at dinner Angered by this he revenges himself
on the wholly innocent Lnsky by flirting outrageously with Olga the
weddingday is only a fortnight distant and Olga being as vain and
weak as she is pretty does her share The result is that Lnsky
challenges Onygin to a duel and the seconds insist that it must be
fought though Onygin would gladly apologize He kills Lnsky
unintentionally and immediately departs on his travels Olga speedily
consoles herself and marries a handsome officer Tatyna a girl of
profound feelings remains inconsolable refuses all offers of marriage
and at last yielding to the entreaties of her anxious relatives
consents to spend a season in Moscow As a wallflower at her first
ball she captivates a wealthy prince of very high standing in St
Petersburg and is persuaded by her parents to marry him When Onygin
returns to the capital he finds the little country girl whose love he
had scorned one of the greatest ladies at the court and in society and
he falls madly in love with her Her cold indifference galls him and
increases his love He writes three letters to which she does not
reply Then he forces himself into her boudoir and finds her reading one
of his letters and weeping over it She then confesses that she loves
him still but dismisses him with the assurance that she will remain
true to her noble and loving husband Tatyna is regarded as one of the
finest most vividly faithful portraits of the genuine Russian woman in
all Russian literature while Olga is considered fully her equal as a
type and in popular sympathy and the other characters are almost
equally good in their various lines

Besides a host of beautiful lyric poems Pshkin left several dramatic
fragments The Ruslka or Water Nymph on which Dargomzhsky founded
a beautiful opera The Stone Guest The Miserly Knight and
chief of all and like Evgny Onygin epochmaking in its line the
historical dramatic fragment Bors Godunff This founded a school in
Russian dramatic writing It is impossible to do justice in translation
to the exquisite lyrics but the following soliloquy from Bors
Godunff will serve to show Pshkins power in blank verse Bors
Godunff brotherinlaw to the Tzar Fedor Mikhilovitch has at last
reached the goal of his ambition and mounted the throne at what cost
his own speech shows Scene The Imperial Palace The Tzar enters

                     Ive reached the height of power
    Tis six years now that I have reigned in peace
    But theres no happiness within my soul
    Is it not thusin youth we thirst and crave
    The joy of love but once that we have quenched
    Our hungry heart with brief possession
    Were tired and cold and weary on the instant
    The sorcerers in vain predict long life
    And promise days of undisturbed power
    Nor power nor life nor aught can cheer my heart
    My soul forebodeth heavens wrath and woe
    I am not happy I did think to still
    With plenty and with fame my people here
    To win for aye their love by bounties free
    But vain are all my cares and empty toils
    A living power is hated by the herd
    They love the dead alone only the dead
    What fools we are when popular applause
    Or the loud shout of masses thrills our heart
    God sent down famine on this land of ours
    The people howled gave up the ghost in torment
    I threw the granaries open and my gold
    I showered upon them sought out work for them
    Made mad by suffering they turned and cursed me
    By conflagrations were their homes destroyed
    I built for them their dwellings fair and new
    And they accused mesaid I had set the fires
    Thats the Lords judgmentseek its love who will
    Then dreamed I bliss in mine own home to find
    I thought to make my daughter blest in wedlock
    Death like a whirlwind snatched her betrothed away
    And rumor craftily insinuates
    That I am author of my own childs widowhood
    I I unhappy father that I am
    Let a man dieI am his secret slayer
    I hastened on the death of Fodor
    I gave my sister the Tzartza poison
    I poisoned her the lovely nunstill I
    Ah yes I know it naught can give us calm
    Amid the sorrows of this present world
    Conscience alone mayhap
    Thus when tis pure it triumphs
    Oer bitter malice oer dark calumny
    But if there be in it a single stain
    One only one by accident contracted
    Why then alls done as with foul plague
    The soul consumes the heart is filled with gall
    Reproaches beat like hammers in the ears
    The man turns sick his head whirls dizzily
    And bloody children float before my eyes
    Id gladly fleeyet whither Horrible
    Yea sad his state whose conscience is not clean

FOOTNOTES

 I take this translation from Sir John Bowrings Specimens of the
Russian Poets rather than attempt a metrical translation myself It is
reasonably close to the originalas close as most metrical translations
areand gives the spirit extremely well Sir John Bowring adds the
following footnote This is the poem of which Golovnin says in his
narrative that it has been rendered into Japanese by order of the
emperor and hung up embroidered in gold in the Temple of Jeddo I
learn from the periodicals that an honor somewhat similar has been done
in China to the same poem It has been translated into the Chinese and
Tartar languages written on a piece of rich silk and suspended in the
imperial palace at Pekin There are several editions of Sir Johns
book the one here used being the second  but the author admits
that in the first edition he stretched the poetic license further than
he had a right to do in this first verse The book is now rare but
this statement will serve as a warning to those who may happen upon the
first edition

 Karamzns youngest daughter by his second marriage was alive when
I was in Russiaa charming old lady She gave me her own copy of her
favorite book a volume in French by Khomyakff very rare and
difficult to obtain and in discussing literary matters wound up thus
They may say what they will about the new men but no one ever wrote
such a beautiful style as my dear papa I also knew some of zeroffs
relatives

 Pronounced Alyg

 A translation of thiswhich is too long to quote heremay be found

 These imperial favors and pensions were continued to his children
His son an artist regularly visited Russia as the guest of Alexander
III I met him on two occasions and was enabled to judge of his fathers
charms of mind and manner

 This building still exists with its garden alluded to in the
Memories But though it still bears its name it is connected by a
glazed gallery with the old palace famous chiefly as Katherine IIs
residence across the street and it is used for suites of apartments
allotted for summer residence to certain courtiers The exact
arrangement of the rooms in Pshkins day is not now known

 The Stone Guest is founded on the Don Juan legend like the
familiar opera Don Giovanni Msorgsky set it to music in sonorous
Wagnerian recitative style though the style was original with him not
copied from Wagner who came later It is rarely given in public but I
had the pleasure of hearing it rendered by famous artists accompanied
by the composer Balakreff at the house of a noted art and musical
critic in St Petersburg

 The reference is to Godunffs presumptive share in the murder at
glitch of Ivn the Terribles infant heir the Tzarvitch Dmtry




CHAPTER VIII

SEVENTH PERIOD FROM PSHKIN TO THE WRITERS OF THE FORTIES


Even Karamzns vast influence on his contemporaries cannot be compared
with that exercised by Pshkin on the literature of the s and s
of the nineteenth century and no Russian writer ever effected so mighty
a change in literature as Pshkin Among other things his influence
brought to life many powerful and original talents which would not have
ventured to enter the literary career without Pshkins friendly support
and encouragement He was remarkably amiable in his relations with all
contemporary writers except certain journalists in St Petersburg and
Moscow and treated with especial respect three poets of his day
Dlvig Baratnsky and Yzykoff He even exaggerated their merits
exalting the work of the last two above his own and attributing great
significance to Dlvigs most insignificant poems and articles Hence
their names have become so closely connected with his that it is almost
impossible to mention him without mentioning them

Baron Antn Antnovitch Dlvig  the descendant of a Baltic
Provinces noble was one of Pshkins comrades in the Lyceum and
published his first collection of poems in 

Evgny Abrmovitch Baratnsky  came of a noble family of good
standing His poetry was founded on Byronism like all European poetry
of that day and was also partly under the influence of the fantastic
romanticism introduced by Zhukvsky He never developed beyond a point
which was reached by Pshkin in his early days in The Prisoner of the
Caucasus The Gypsies The Fountain of Baktchesari and the first
chapters of Evgny Onygin He wrote one very fine poem devoted to
Finland

Nikoli Mikhilovitch Yzykoff  was of noble birth and
published a number of early poems in  One of his best and longest
published about  was a dramatic tale of The Fire Bird Between
 his The Lighthouse Gastn Sea Bathing The Ship
The Sea and a whole series of elegies are also very good Yzykoffs
poetry is weaker and paler in coloring than Dlvigs or Baratnskys
yet richer than all of theirs in really incomparable outward form of the
verse and in poetical expression of thought in fact he was the poet
of expression and rendered great service by his boldness and
originality of language in that it taught men to write not as all
others wrote but as it lay in their individual power to write in other
words he inculcated individuality in literature

The only one of the many poets of Pshkins epoch in Russia who did not
repeat and develop in different keys the themes of their masters
poetry was Alexnder Sergyevitch Griboydoff  He alone was
independent original and was related to the Pshkin period as Krylff
was to the Karamzn periodmerely by the accident of time not by the
contents of his work Griboydoff was the first of a series of Russian
poets who depicted life in absolutely faithful but gloomy colors and
it was quite in keeping with this view that he did not live to see in
print the comedy in which his wellearned fame rested at the time and
which still keeps it fresh by performances on the stage at the present
day

There was nothing very cheerful or bright about the social life of the
s in the nineteenth century to make Russian poets take anything but
a gloomy view of matters in general Griboydoff as an unprejudiced
man endowed with great poetical gifts and remarkable powers of
observation was able to give a faithful and wonderfully complete
picture of high life in Moscow of that day in his famous comedy Woe
from Wit Gre ot Um and introduce to the stage types which had
never hitherto appeared in Russian comedy because no one had looked
deep enough into Russian hearts or been capable of limning impartially
and with fidelity to nature the emptiness and vanity of the characters
and aims which preponderated in Russian society

He was well born and very well educated After serving in the army in
 like most patriotic young Russians of the day he entered the
foreign office in  There he probably made the acquaintance of
Pshkin but he never became intimate with him as he belonged to a
different literary circle which included actors and dramatic writers
His first dramatic efforts were not very promising though his first
comedy The Young Married Pair was acted in St Petersburg in 
In  he was offered the post of secretary of legation in Persia
which he accepted and this took him away from the gay and rather wild
society existence which he was leading with bad results in many ways
In Persia despite his multifarious occupations and his necessary study
of Oriental languages Griboydoff found time to plan his famous comedy
in  and in  he wrote it in Georgia whither he had been
transferred But he remodeled and rewrote portions of it and it was
finished only in  when he spent a year in Moscow his native city
When it was entirely ready for acting he went to St Petersburg but
neither his most strenuous efforts nor his influence in high quarters
sufficed to secure the censors permission for its performance on stage
or to get the requisite license for printing it But it circulated in
innumerable manuscript copies and every one was in raptures over it
Even the glory of Pshkins Evgny Onygin which appeared at about
the same time did not overshadow Griboydoffs glory Strange to say
Pshkin who had magnified Dlvig Baratnsky and Yzykoff far above
their merits and in general was accustomed to overrate all talent
whether it belonged to his own friends or to strangers was extremely
severe on Griboydoffs comedy and detected many grave defects in it

Griboydoff was greatly irritated by his failure to obtain proper public
recognition of his comedy He expressed his feelings freely became more
embittered than ever against mankind in general and went back to
Georgia in  where he added to his previous poems and took part in
the campaign against Persia in which he rendered great services to the
commanderinchief As a reward he was sent to St Petersburg 
to present the treaty of peace to the Emperor He was promptly appointed
minister plenipotentiary to Persia and on his way thither in Tifls
married a Georgian princess His stern course of action and his
disregard of certain rooted Oriental customs aroused the priesthood and
the ignorant masses of Teheran against him and a riot broke out After
a heroic defense of the legation all the Russians including
Griboydoff were torn to pieces His wife had been left behind in
Tabreez and escaped She buried his remains at a monastery near Tifls
in accordance with a wish which he had previously expressed

There is not much plot to Woe from Wit Moltchlin Famsoffs
secretary a cold calculating fickle young man has been making love
to Famsoffs only child an heiress Sophia an extremely sentimental
young person Famsoff rails against foreign books and fashions
destroyers of our pockets and our hearth and lauds Colonel Skalozb
an elderly pretender to Sophias hand explaining the general servile
policy of obtaining rank and position by the Russian equivalent of
pull which is called connections He compares his with Tchtsky to
the disadvantage of the latter who had been brought up with Sophia and
had been in love with her before his departure on his travels three
years previously though he had never mentioned the fact Tchtsky gives
rise to this diatribe by returning from his travels at this juncture
asking for Sophias hand and trying to woo the girl herself with equal
unsuccess Tchtskys arraignment of the imitation of foreign customs
then everywhere prevalent does not win favor from any one Worse yet
he expresses his opinion of Moltchlin and Sophia in revenge drops a
hint that Tchtsky is crazy The hint grows apace and the cause is
surmised to be a bulletwound in the head received during a recent
campaign Another authority contradicts this it comes from drinking
champagne by the gobletfulno by the bottleno by the case But
Famsoff settles the matter by declaring that it comes from knowing too
much This takes place at an evening party at the Famsoffs and
Tchtsky returns to the room to meet with an amazing reception
Eventually he discovers that he is supposed to be mad and that he is
indebted to Sophia for the origin of the lie also that she is making
rendezvous with the lowminded flippant Moltchlin At last Sophia
discovers that Moltchlin is making love to her maid through
inclination and to her only through calculation She casts him off and
orders him out of the house Tchtsky cured of all illusions about her
renounces his suit for her hand and declares that he will leave Moscow
forever Tchtsky whose woe is due to his persistence in talking sense
and truth to people who do not care to hear it and to his manly
independence all the way through comes to grief through having too much
wit hence the title

Not one of Pshkins successors talented as many of them were was able
to attain to the position of importance which the great poet had
rendered obligatory for future aspirants It is worth noting that
Pshkins best work in his second nonByronic purely national style
enjoyed less success among his contemporaries than his early
halfimitative efforts where the characters were weak lacking in
independent creation and where the whole tone was gloomy This gloomy
tone expressed the sentiments of all Russia of the period and it was
natural that Byronic heroes should be in consonance with the general
taste At this juncture a highly talented poet arose Mikhil
Yrievitch Lrmontoff  who after first imitating Pshkin
speedily began to imitate Byronand that with far more success than
Pshkin had ever donewith great delicacy and artistic application to
the local conditions Thus as a vivid natural echo of this epoch in
Russian life the poet became dear to the heart of Russians and in the
s they regarded him as the equal of the writers they most loved

Lrmontoff the son of a poor but noble family was reared by his
grandmother as his mother died when he was a baby and his father an
army officer could not care for him The grandmother did her utmost to
give him the best education possible at that time and to make him a
brilliant society man The early foreign influence over Pshkin was as
we have seen French That over Lrmontoff was rather English which was
then becoming fashionable But like many another young Russian of that
day Lrmontoff wrote his first poems in French imitating Pshkins
The Fountain of Baktchesari and Byrons The Prisoner of Chillon He
finished the preparatory school with the first prize for composition and
history and entered the University which he was soon compelled to
leave in company with a number of others because of a foolish prank
they had played on a professor In those days when every one was
engrossed in thoughts of military service and a career and when the few
remaining paths which were open to a poor young man had thus been closed
to him but one thing was left for him to doenter the army
Accordingly in  Lrmontoff entered the Ensigns School in St
Petersburg but during his two years there he did not abandon
versemaking and here he first began to imitate Byron A couple of
poems Ismail Bey  and Hadji Abrek  were published by a
comrade without Lrmontoffs knowledge at this time In general it
may be said of Lrmontoff at that period that he cared not in the least
for literary fame and made no haste to publish his writings as to
which he was very severe Many were not published until five or six
years after they were written

Soon after leaving the military school Lrmontoff wrote a drama The
Masquerade  and the fine poem Boyrin rsha but his fame
began only in  with his splendid poem on the death of Pshkin The
Death of the Poet beginning The poet perished the slave of honor
in which he expressed his entire sympathy with the poet in his untimely
death and poured out all his bitterness upon the circle which was
incapable of appreciating and prizing the genius This in a multitude
of manuscript copies created a great sensation in St Petersburg Soon
afterwards on hearing contradictory rumors as to the duel and Pshkins
death he added sixteen verses beginning And you ye arrogant
descendants One of the prominent persons therein attacked having had
his attention called to the matter in public by an officious gossip he
had probably known all about it before and deliberately ignored the
matter felt obliged to report Lrmontoff The result was that
Lrmontoff was transferred as ensign to a dragoon regiment which was
serving in Georgia and early in  he set out for the Caucasus
Through his grandmothers efforts he was permitted to return from the
Caucasus about eight months later to a hussar regiment By this time
people were beginning to appreciate him he had written his magnificent
Ballad of Tzar Ivn Vaslievitch the Young Lifeguardsman and the Bold
Merchant Kalshnikoff which every one hailed as an entirely new
phenomenon in Russian literature amazing in its highly artistic
pictures full of power and dignity combined with an exterior like that
of the inartistic productions of folkpoetry This poem was productive
of all the more astonishment because his The Demon written much
earlier  was little known The Demon is poor in contents
but surprisingly rich in wealth and luxury of coloring and in the
endless variety of its pictures of Caucasian life and nature

In  while residing in St Petersburg Lrmontoff wrote little at
first but in  he wrote Mtzyri and a whole series of fine tales
in prose which eventually appeared under the general title of A Hero
of Our Times This work which has lost much of its vivid interest for
people of the present day must remain nevertheless one of the most
important monuments of that period to which Lrmontoff so completely
belonged In the person of the hero Petchrin he endeavored to present
a portrait composed of the vices of the generation of which he was a
contemporary and he drew the man of the period as he understood him
and as unfortunately he was too often met with Lrmontoff admitted
that in Petchrin he had tried to point out the malady which had
attacked all Russian society of that day All this he said in a preface
to the second edition after people had begun to declare that in the
novel he had represented himself and his own experiences Naturally
Petchrin was drawn on Byronic lines in keeping with the spirit of the
s when individuality loudly protested against the oppressive
conditions of life Naturally also all this now appears to be a
caricature true to the life of the highest Russian society as it was
when it was written Before he had quite completed this work in
February  Lrmontoff fought a duel with the son of Baron de
Barante a wellknown French historian and was transferred in
consequence to an infantry regiment in the Caucasus whither he betook
himself for the third time A year later after being permitted to make
a brief stay in St Petersburg he returned to the Caucasus and three
months afterwards he was killed in a duel on July  O S  with
a fellow officer Martnoff and was buried on the estate in the
government of Pnza where he had been reared by his grandmother The
latest work of the poet thus cut off almost before his prime consisted
of lyrics which were full of power and perfection and gave plain
promise of the approaching maturity of the still young and not fully
developed but immense talent

His famous Ballad of Tzar Ivn Vaslievitch the Young Lifeguardsman
and the Bold Merchant Kalshnikoff must be given in a summary and
occasional quotations as it is too long to reproduce in full It lends
itself better to dignified and adequate reproduction than do his lyrics
because it is not rhymed After a brief preface the poet says We
have composed a ballad in the ancient style and have sung it to the
sound of the dulcimer

          The red sun shineth not in the heaven
    The blue clouds delight not in it
    But at his banqueting board in golden crown
    Sitteth the Terrible Tzar Ivn Vaslievitch
    Behind him stand the tabledeckers
    Opposite him all the boyrs and the princes
    At his side all about the lifeguardsmen
    And the Tzar feasteth to the glory of God
    To his own content and merriment


The ballad goes on to relate how the Tzar then ordered the beakers to be
filled with wine from beyond the seas and how all drank and lauded the
Tzar One brave warrior a gallant youth did not dip his mustache in
the golden cup but dropped his eyes drooped his head and meditated
The Tzar frowned rapped on the floor with his irontipped staff and
finding that the young man still paid no heed called him to account
Hey there our faithful servant Kiribyevitch art thou concealing
some dishonorable thought Or art thou envious of our glory Or hath our
honorable service wearied thee and he reproaches the youth Then
Kiribyevitch answered him bowing to his girdle begging the Tzar not
to reproach his unworthy servant but if he has offended the Tzar he
begs that the latter will order his head to be cut off It oppresseth
my heroic shoulders and itself unto the damp earth doth incline The
Tzar inquires why the lifeguardsman is sad Has his kaftan of gold
brocade grown threadbare Has his cap of sables got shabby Has he
exhausted his treasure Has his welltempered saber got nicked Or has
some merchants son from across the Moscow River overcome him in a
boxing match The young lifeguardsman shakes his curly head and says
that all these things are as they should be but that while he was
riding his mettlesome steed in the TransMoscow River quarter of the
town the merchants quarter with his silken girdle drawn taut his
velvet cap rimmed jauntily with black sables fair young maidens had
stood at the board gates gazing at him admiring and whispering
together but one there was who gazed not admired not but covered her
face with her striped veil and in all Holy Russia our Mother no such
beauty is to be found or searched out She walketh swimmingly as
though she were a young swan She gazeth sweetly as though she were a
dove When she uttereth a word tis like a nightingale warbling Her
cheeks are aflame with roses like unto the dawn in Gods heaven Her
tresses of ruddy gold intertwined with bright ribbons flow rippling
down her shoulders and kiss her white bosom She was born in a
merchants family Her name is Alyna Dmtrievna

He describes how he has fallen in love with her at first sight and
cares no more for anything in all the world save her and begs that he
may be sent away to the steppes along the Volga to live a free kazk
life where he may lay his turbulent head on a Mussulmans spear in
the fights with the Tatars of Kazn is what is meant where the
vultures may claw out his tearful eyes and his gray bones be washed by
the rain and his wretched dust without burial may be scattered to the
four quarters of the compass Tzar Ivn Vaslievitch laughs advises him
to send gifts to his Alyna and celebrate the wedding The
lifeguardsman then confesses that he has not told the whole truth that
the beauty is already the wife of a young merchant

In Part II the young merchant is represented as seated at his
shopboard a stately dashing young fellow Stepn Paramnovitch
Kalshnikoff spreading out his silken wares beguiling his patrons or
guests with flattering speech counting out gold and silver But it
is one of his bad days the wealthy lords pass and do not so much as
glance at his shop The bells of the holy churches have finished
chiming for Vespers The cloudy glow of evening burneth behind the
Kremlin Little clouds are flitting athwart the sky The great Gostny
Dvor is empty And Stepn Paramnovitch locks the oaken door of his
shop with a German that is a foreign springlock fastens the fierce
snarling dog to the iron chain and goes thoughtfully home to his young
housewife beyond the Moscow River On arriving there he is surprised
that his wife does not come to meet him as is her wont The oaken table
is not set the taper before the ikna the holy picture is almost
burned out He summons the old maidservant and asks where his wife is
at that late hour and what has become of his children The servant
replies that his wife went to Vespers as usual but the priest and his
wife have already sat down to sup yet the young housewife has not
returned and his little children are neither playing nor in bed but
weeping bitterly As young Merchant Kalshnikoff then looks out into the
gloomy street he sees that the night is very dark snow is falling
covering up mens tracks and he hears the outer door slam then hasty
footsteps approaching turns round and beholds his young wife pale
with hair uncovered which is highly improper for a married woman her
chestnut locks unbraided sprinkled with snow and hoarfrost her eyes
dull and wild her lips muttering unintelligibly The husband inquires
where she has been the reason for her condition and threatens to lock
her up behind an ironbound oaken door away from the light of day She
weeping bitterly begs her lord her fair little red sun to slay her
or to listen to her and she explains that as she was coming home from
Vespers she heard the snow crunching behind her glanced round and
beheld a man running She covered herself with her veil but the man
seized her hands bade her have no fear and said that he was no robber
but the servant of the Terrible Tzar Kiribyevitch from the famous
family of Malita promised her her hearts desiregold pearls bright
gems flowered brocadesif she would but love him and grant him one
embrace Then he caressed and kissed her so that her cheeks are still
burning while the neighbors looked on laughed and pointed their
fingers at her in scorn Tearing herself from his hands she fled
homewards leaving in his hands her flowered kerchief her husbands
gift and her Bokhar veil She entreats her husband not to give her
over to the scorn of their neighbors she is an orphan her elder
brother is in a foreign land her younger brother still a mere child

Stepn Paramnovitch thereupon sends for his two younger brothers but
they send back a demand to know what has happened that he should require
their presence on a dark cold night He informs them that
Kiribyevitch the lifeguardsman has dishonored their family that such
an insult the soul cannot brook neither a brave mans heart endure On
the morrow there is to be a fight with fists in the presence of the Tzar
himself and it is his intention to go to it and stand up against that
lifeguardsman and fight him to the death until his strength is gone He
asks them in case he is killed to step forth for Holy Mother right
and as they are younger than he fresher in strength and with fewer
sins on their heads perchance the Lord will show mercy upon them And
this reply his brethren spake Whither the breeze bloweth beneath the
sky thither hasten the dutiful little clouds When the dark blue eagle
summoneth with his voice to the bloody vale of slaughter summoneth to
celebrate the feast to clear away the dead to him do the little
eaglets wing their flight Thou art our elder brother our second
father do what thou seest fit and deemest best and we will not fail
thee our own blood and bone

Part III picturesquely and vividly describes the scene of the
encounter the challenge to the combatants to stand forth by command of
the Tzar with a promise in the latters name that the victors shall
receive from him rewards Then the redoubtable Lifeguardsman
Kiribyevitch steps forth Thrice the challenge is repeated before any
one responds Then young Merchant Kalshnikoff comes forward makes his
reverence to the Tzar and when Kiribyevitch demands his name he
announces it and adds that he was born of an honorable father and has
always lived according to Gods law he has not cast his eyes on another
mans wife nor played the bandit on a dark night nor hid from the
light of heaven and that he means to fight to the death On hearing
this Kiribyevitch turned pale as snow in autumn his bold eyes
clouded over a shiver ran through his mighty shoulders on his parted
lips the words fell dead With one blow the young merchant crushes in
the lifeguardsmans breast and the latter falls dead the death being
beautifully described in stately picturesque language At sight
thereof the Tzar Ivn Vaslievitch waxed wroth stamped on the earth
scowled with his black brows ordered that the young merchant be seized
and hauled before him He then demands whether Kalshnikoff has slain
his faithful servant Kiribyevitch voluntarily involuntarily or
against his will Kalshnikoff boldly makes answer that he has done it
with deliberate intent and that the reason therefor he will not tell to
the Tzar but only to God alone He tells the Tzar to order him to be
executed but not to deprive his little children or his young widow and
his brothers of his favor The Tzar replies that it is well Kalshnikoff
has answered truthfully he will give the young widow and the children a
grant from his treasury and give command that from that day forth his
brothers may traffic throughout the wide Russian realm free of taxes
But Kalshnikoff must mount the scaffold lay down his turbulent head
and the executioner shall be ordered to make his axe very sharp and the
great bell shall be tolled in order that all the men of Moscow may know
that the Tzar has not deprived him of his favor The execution and
Kalshnikoffs farewell speeches to his brothers with his last messages
to his wife not to grieve so greatly and his commands that she is not
to tell his children how their father died together with requests for
prayers for his soul are described in very touching and lofty terms as
are also the burial and the scenes at the grave

                                   

The influence of Schellings philosophy on the society of Moscow the
literary center until halfway through the s of the nineteenth
century was very great This philosophy held that every historical
nation should express some idea or other that a nation could be called
historical only on condition of its being independent in this respect
and that its importance in the progress of general civilization is
determined by its degree of independence This set all thoughtful people
to considering the place of Russia among the European nations and all
the problems suggested by this philosophy came up with special force in
the Russian literature of the end of the s and split society into
two great campsthe Slavyanophils slavophils and the Westerners
These camps had existed earlier but had concerned themselves only with
the purification of the Russian language or with sentimental admiration
for everything Russian or for everything foreign as the case might be
But now both parties undertook to solve the problems connected with the
fate of the nation

Schellings philosophy also suggested new views as to the theory of art
and the significance of literature in the life of a nation and evolved
the conclusion that a nations literature even more than its
civilization should be entirely independent This naturally led the
Slavyanophils to reflect upon the indispensability of establishing
Russian literature on a thoroughly national independent basis
Naturally also this led to the Slavyanophils contesting the existence
of a Russian literature in the proper sense of the term since the whole
of it from Lomonsoff to Pshkin had been merely a servile imitation
of Western literature and did not in the least express the spirit of
the Russian people and of the Schellingists A number of the professors
in the Moscow University belonged to this party Naturally the students
in their departmentthe philological facultycame under their
influence and under this influence was reared the famous Russian
critic Vissarin Grigrievitch Byelnsky  His name is
chiefly identified with the journal The Annals of the Fatherland of
St Petersburg where he published his brilliant critical articles on
Griboydoff Ggols The Inspector on Lrmontoffs works and on
those of other writers on French contemporary literature and on
current topics at home and abroad among them articles condemning many
characteristics of Russian society both intellectual and moral such as
the absence of intellectual interests routine narrowness and egotism
in the middleclass merchants selfsatisfied philistinism the
patriarchal laxity of provincial morals the lack of humanity and the
Asiatic ferocity towards inferiors the slavery of women and children
under the weight of family despotism His volume of articles on Pshkin
constitutes a complete critical history of Russian literature beginning
with Lomonsoff and ending with Pshkin By these Byelnskys standing
as an important factor in literature was thoroughly established and all
the young writers of the succeeding epoch that of the s gathered
around him Grigorvitch Turgneff Gontcharff Nekrsoff Apolln
Mikoff Dostovsky Tolsty and the rest may be said to have been
reared on Byelnskys criticism inspired by it to creative activity
and indebted to it for much of their fame Byelnsky moreover educated
the minds of that whole generation and prepared men for the social
movement of the s which was characterized by many reforms

After  Byelnsky was connected with the journal The Contemporary
published by the poet Nekrsoff and I I Paneff to which the best
writers of the day contributed Here during the brief period when his
health permitted him to work he expressed even bolder and more
practical ideas and became the advocate of the natural school of
which he regarded Ggol as the founder wherein poetry was treated as
an integral part of everyday life Turgneff has declared that
Byelnsky indisputably possessed all the chief qualities of a great
critic and that no one before him or better than he ever expressed a
correct judgment and an authoritative verdict and that he was
emphatically the right man in the right place

One author who deserves to be better known outside of Russia produced
the really original and indescribably fascinating works on which his
fame rests during the last ten or twelve years of his long life late in
the s and s although he was much older than the authors we have
recently studied and began to write much earlier than many of them His
early writing however was in the classical style and does not count
in comparison with his original descriptions of nature and of the life
of the comparatively distant past Sergyi Timofevitch Akskoff
 the descendant of a very ancient noble family was born in
faraway eastern Russia in Uf and was very well educated by his
mother at schools and at Kazn University His talents first revealed
themselves in  in his Notes on Angling and his Diary of a
Sportsman with a Gun in the Orenburg Government  Most famous of
all and most delightful are the companion volumes A Family Chronicle
and Souvenirs  and The Childhoods Years of Bagrffs Grandson
 In these Russian descriptive language made a great stride in
advance even after Pshkin and Ggol and as a limner of landscape he
has no equal in Russian literature The most noteworthy point about his
work is that there is not a trace of creative fancy or invention he
describes reality takes everything straight from life and describes
it with amazing faithfulness and artistic harmony He was the first
Russian writer to look on Russian life from a positive instead of from a
negative point of view

Pshkins period had been important not only in rendering Russian
literature national but still more so in bringing literature into close
connection with life and its interests This had in turn led to a love
of reading and of literature all over the country and had developed
latent talents This love spread to classes hitherto unaffected by it
and among the talents it thus developed none was more thoroughly
independent than that of Alexi Vaslievitch Koltzff  who
was so original so wholly unique in his genius that he cannot rightly
be assigned to any class and still stands as an isolated phenomenon He
was the son of a merchant of Vornezh who was possessed of considerable
means and he spent the greater part of his youth on the steppes
helping his father a drover who supplied tallowfactories After being
taught to read and write by a theological student young Koltzff was
sent to the district school for four months after which his education
was regarded as finished because he knew as much as the people about
him and because no more was required for business purposes But the lad
acquired a strong love of reading and devoted himself to such
literature as he could procure popular fairytales the Thousand and
One Nights and so forth He was sixteen years of age when Dmtrieffs
works fell into his hands and inspired him with a desire to imitate
them and to make songs himself As yet he did not understand the
difference between poetry and popular songs and did not read verses
but sang them The local bookseller was the first to recognize his
poetical tendency and in a degree guided him on the right road with a
Russian Prosody and other suitable books such as the works of
Zhukvsky Pshkin and other contemporary poets A passion for writing
poetry was in the air in the s But although he yielded to this and
to the promptings of his genius it was a long time before he was able
to clothe his thoughts in tolerable form An unhappy love had a powerful
influence on the development of his poetical talent and his versified
efforts suddenly became fervent songs of love and hate of melancholy
soulful cries of grief and woe full of melodious expressions of the
world about him One of Byelnskys friends whose family lived near
Vornezh made his acquaintance read his poems and applauded much in
them Three years later in  at the request and expense of this new
friend Koltzff published a small collection containing eighteen poems
selected by him which showed that he possessed an original and really
noteworthy poetical gift In  Koltzff visited St Petersburg and
made acquaintance with Pshkin Zhukvsky and many other literary men
and between  and  his fame penetrated even to the knowledge of
the citizens in his native town He continued to aid his father in
business but his heart was elsewherehe longed for the intellectual
companionship of his friends in Moscow and all this rendered him
extremely unhappy In  he spent three months with Byelnsky in St
Petersburg and after that he remained in Vornezh had another unhappy
love affair and dreamed continually of the possibility of quitting the
place for good But his father would not give him a kopk for such a
purpose His health gave way and he died in  aged thirtythree

His poems are few in number and the best of them belong to an entirely
peculiar style which he alone in Russian literature possesses to which
he alone imparted significancethe ballad the national ballad compact
powerful rich in expression and highly artistic The charm of
nationality is so great as expressed in Koltzffs songs that it is
almost impossible to read them one wants to sing them as the author
sang the verses of others in his boyhood Even his peculiar measures
which are not at all adapted to popular songs do not destroy the
harmonious impression made by them and such pieces as The Forest
The Ballads of Cabman Kudryvitch The Perfidy of the Affianced
Bride and others not only belong to the most notable productions of
Russian lyric poetry but are also representatives of an important
historical phenomenon as the first attempt to combine in one organic
whole Russian artistic literature and the inexhaustible vast inartistic
poetry of the people The Perfidy of the Affianced Bride which is not
rhymed in the original runs as follows

    Hot in heaven the summer sun doth shine
    But me young though I be it warmeth not
    My heart is dead with cold
    Through the perfidy of my affianced bride

    Woesadness upon me hath fallen
    Upon my sorrowful head
    My soul by deadly anguish is tormented
    And from my body my soul doth long to flee

    Unto men have I resorted for help
    With a laugh have they turned away
    To the grave of my father my mother
    But they rise not at my call

    The world grew dark before mine eyes
    Upon the grass I swooned
    At dead of night in a dreadful storm
    They lifted me from the grave

    At night in the storm I saddled my steed
    I set out caring not whither I went
    To lead a wretched life to console myself
    With rancor to demand satisfaction from men

Romanticism established as its first principles freedom of creation
and nationality of poetry and these principles survived romanticism
itself Now while romanticism preached freedom of creation it
circumscribed this freedom by selecting as subjects for poetical
compositions chiefly the extraordinary sides of life its majestic
moments Its heroes were always choice powerful natures who suffered
profoundly because of the lot of all mankind and were capable of
gigantic conflicts against the whole world Classicism had bequeathed
this habit of regarding as worthy of poetical treatment only heroes who
stood out from the mass and of depicting these heroes only at critical
crises All this depended in a great degree upon the political and
social conditions which prevailed at that epochthe beginning of the
nineteenth century But quieter more peaceful times dawned and with
them mens tastes and habits of mind underwent a change They grew tired
of scorning and hating reality because it did not conform to their
cherished dreams and they began coolly to study it The titanic heroes
who had become tiresome and antipathetic to the last degree made way
for ordinary mortals in their everyday surroundings Lyrical exaltation
was superseded by calm observation or disintegrating analysis of the
different elements of life pathetic misery made way for cold irony or
jeeringly melancholy humor and at last poetry was succeeded by prose
and the ruling poetical forms of the new epoch became the romance and
the novel This change took place almost simultaneously in all the
literatures of Europe

We have seen that Pshkin towards the end of his career entered upon
this new path with his prose tales The Captains Daughter
Dubrvsky and so forth and throughout the s of the nineteenth
century the romance and novel came more and more to occupy the most
prominent place in Russian literature We may pass over the rather long
list of secondclass writers who adventured in this field of whom
Zagskin and Mrlinsky are most frequently referred to and devote our
attention to the man who has been repeatedly called the father of
modern Russian realism Nikoli Vaslievitch Ggol  He is
credited with having created all the types which we encounter in the
works of the great novelists who followed him and this is almost
literally true at least so far as the male characters are concerned In
particular this applies to his famous Dead Souls which contains if
not the condensed characterization in full of these types at least the
readily recognized germs of them But in this respect his early Little
Russian Stories Tales from a Farmhouse Near Diknka and the
companion volume Mrgorod as well as his famous comedy The
Inspector must not be forgotten for they contributed their full
quota Pshkin was one of Ggols earliest and most ardent admirers and
it was because he recognized the latters phenomenal talent in seizing
the national types that he gave to him the idea for Dead Souls which
he had intended to use himself Thanks to his own genius as well as to
the atmosphere of the epoch in which he lived he solved for himself
quite independently of any foreign influence the problem of bringing
Russian literature down from the clouds to everyday real life He
realized that the world was no longer living in a sort of modern epic
as it had been during the French Revolution and the Napoleonic
campaigns and that literature must conform to the altered conditions
Naturally in his new quest after truth GgolYanvsky to give him his
full name mingled romanticism and realism at first But he soon
discovered the true path He was born and reared in Little Russia at
Sortchinsky Government of Poltva and was separated only by two
generations from the famous epoch of the Zaporzhian kazks who lived
as their name implies below the rapids of the Dnipr He has depicted
their life in his magnificent novel Tars Blba His grandfather had
been the regimental scribea post of honorof that kazk army and the
spirit of the Zaporzhian kazks still lingered over the land which was
full of legends fervent superstitious piety and poetry

Ggols grandfather who figures as Rdy Pnko the beefarmer in the
two volumes of Little Russian stories which established his fame
narrated to him at least onehalf of those stories His father also
who represented the modern spirit was an inimitable narrator of comic
stories and the talents of father and grandfather rendered their house
the popular center of a very extensive neighborhood

At school Ggol did not distinguish himself but he wrote a good deal
all of an imitative character After leaving school it was with
difficulty that he secured a place as copyingclerk at a wretched
salary in St Petersburg He promptly resigned this when fame came and
secured the appointment as professor of history But he was a hopelessly
incompetent professor of history despite his soaring ambitions both on
account of his lack of scholarship and the natural bent of his mind The
literary men who had obtained the position for him had discerned his
immense talent in a perfectly new style of writing and after failure
had convinced him that heavy scientific work was not in his line he
recognized the fact himself and decided to devote himself to the sort
of work for which nature had intended him The first volume of his
Tales from a Farmhouse Near Diknka appeared at the end of  and
had an immense success The second volume Mrgorod was equally
successful all the more so as it introduced together with the pure
merriment which had characterized the earlier tales and the realism
which was his specialty so to speak a new elementpathos laughter
piercing through a mist of tears In this style Oldfashioned
Gentry and How Ivn Ivnovitch Quarrelled with Ivn Nikifrovitch
are famous examples Success always turned Ggols head and he
immediately aspired to some undertaking far beyond his powers In this
case for instance despising as usual what he could do best he
planned a huge work in nine volumes on the history of the Middle
Ages Fortunately his preparatory studies in the history of Little
Russia led him to write his splendid epic which is a composition of the
highest art Tars Blba and diverted him from his illdigested
project

He began to recognize that literary work was not merely a pastime but
his moral duty and the first result of this conviction was his great
play The Inspector finished in April  The authorities refused
to produce it but the Emperor Nicholas I heard about it read it and
gave imperative orders that it should be put on the stage upholding
Ggol with rapturous delight Everybodyofficials the police literary
people merchantsattacked the author They raged at this comedy
refused to recognize their too lifelike portraits and still endeavored
to have the play prohibited Ggols health and spirits failed under
this persecution and he fled abroad whence thereafter he returned to
Russia only at long intervals and for brief visits chiefly to Moscow
where most of his faithful friends resided He traveled a great deal
but spent most of his time in Rome where his lavish charities kept him
perennially poor despite the eventual and complete success both
artistically and financially of The Inspector and of Part I of
Dead Souls which would have enabled him to live in comfort He was
wont to say that he could see Russia plainly only when he was at a
distance from her and in a measure he proved the truth of his
contention in the first volume of Dead Souls Thereby he justified
Pshkins expectations in giving him the subject of that work which he
hoped would enable Ggol to depict the classes and localities of the
fatherland in the concentrated form of types But he lived too long in
Rome The Russian mind in general is much inclined to mysticism and
Little Russia in Ggols boyhood was exceptionally permeated with
exaggerated religious sentiment Mysticism seems to be peculiarly fatal
to Russian writers of eminence we have seen how Von Vzin and Zhukvsky
were affected toward the end of their lives we have a typical and even
more pronounced example of it in a somewhat different form at the
present time in Count L N Tolsty Lrmontoff had inclined in that
direction Hence it is not surprising that the moral and physical
atmosphere of Rome during a too prolonged residence there eventually
ruined Ggols mind and health and extinguished the last sparks of his
genius especially as even in his schooldays he had shown a marked
tendency in his letters to his mother to religious exaltation Now
under the pressure of his personal tendencies and friendships and the
clerical atmosphere of Rome he developed into a mystic and an ascetic
of the most extreme type He regarded all his earlier writings as sins
which must be atoned for precisely as Count L N Tolsty regards his
masterpieces at the present time and nevertheless his overweening
selfesteem was so flattered by the tremendous success of The
Inspector and the first part of Dead Souls that he began to regard
himself as a sort of divinely commissioned prophet on whom it was
incumbent to preach to his fellowmen It will be seen that the parallel
holds good in this respect also Extracts from his hortatory letters
which he published proved to Russians that his day was over His failure
in his selfimposed mission plunged him into the extremes of
selftorment and his lucid moments grew more and more rare He
destroyed what he had written of the second part of Dead Souls in
the attacks of ecstatic remorse at such profane work which followed By
some authorities it is believed that he did this unintentionally
meaning to destroy an entirely different set of papers In  he made
a pilgrimage to Jerusalem and went thence to Moscow where he resided
until his death becoming more and more extreme in his mysticism and
asceticism He spent sleepless nights in prayer he tried to carry
fasting to the extent of living for a week on one of the tiny double
loaves which are used for the Holy Communion in the Eastern Catholic
Church a feat which it is affirmed can be performed with success and
even to more exaggerated extent by practiced ascetics Ggol died His
observation was acute his humor was genuine natural infectious his
realism was of the most vivid description his power of limning types
was unsurpassed and it is these types which have entered as to their
essential ingredients into the works of his successors that have
rendered the Russian realistic literary school famous He wrote only one
complete play besides The Inspector and it is still acted
occasionally but it is not of a sort to appeal to the universal public
as is his famous comedy The fantastic but amusing plot of this lesser
comedy Marriage is founded upon a young girls meditations on that
theme and the actions which lead up to and follow them The wealthy
heroine of the merchant class being desirous of marrying enlists the
services of the professional matchmaker the oldtime Russian
matrimonial agent in the merchant and peasant classes This matchmaker
offers for her choice several eligible suitors all strangers and the
girl makes her choice She is well pleased with it but suddenly begins
to speculate on the future is moved to tears by the prospect that her
daughter may be unhappy in a hypothetical marriage in the dim future
and at last driven to despair by this painful picture of her fancy she
evades her betrothed and breaks off the match

The interest of The Inspector is perennial and universal official
negligence corruption bribery masculine vanity and boastfulness and
feminine failings to match are the exclusive prerogatives of no one
nation or epoch The comedy is not a caricature but it is a faithful
society portrait and satire with intense condensation of character and
traits which are not only truly and typically Russian but come within
the ken of all fairminded persons of other lands The scene opens in a
room at the house of the Chief of Police in a provincial town Those
present are The Chief himself the Curator of the Board of Benevolent
Institutions the Superintendent of Schools the Judge the Commissioner
of Police the Doctor and two policemen

     CHIEFI have summoned you hither gentlemen in order to
     communicate to you an unpleasant piece of news An Inspector is
     coming

     JUDGEWhat An Inspector

     CHIEFAn Inspector from St Petersburg incognito and with
     secret orders to boot

     JUDGEI thought so

     CURATORIf theres not trouble Im mistaken

     CHIEFI have warned you gentlemen See to it I have made
     some arrangements in my own department and I advise you to do
     the same Especially you Artmy Philppitch Without a doubt
     this traveling official will wish first of all to inspect
     your institutions and therefore you must arrange things so
     that they will be decent The nightcaps should be clean and
     the sick people should not look like blacksmiths as they
     usually do in private

     CURATORWell that is a mere trifle We can put clean
     nightcaps on them

     CHIEFMoreover you ought to have written up over the head
     of each bed in Latin or some other languagethats your
     affairthe name of each disease when each patient was taken
     sick the day and the hour It is not well that your sick
     people should smoke such strong tobacco that one has to sneeze
     every time he goes in there Yes and it would be better if
     there were fewer of them it will be set down at once to bad
     supervision or to lack of skill on the doctors part

     CURATOROh so far as the doctoring is concerned Christin
     Ivnitch and I have already taken measures the nearer to
     nature the betterwe dont use any expensive medicines Man
     is a simple creature if he dies why then he dies if he gets
     well why then he gets well and moreover it would have been
     difficult for Christin Ivnitch to make them understand him
     he doesnt know one word of Russian

     CHIEFI should also advise you Amms Fedoritch to turn
     your attention to court affairs In the anteroom where the
     clients usually assemble your janitor has got a lot of geese
     and goslings which waddle about under foot Of course it is
     praiseworthy to be thrifty in domestic affairs and why should
     not the janitor be so too Only you know it is not proper in
     that place I intended to mention it to you before but always
     forgot it

     JUDGEIll order them to be taken to the kitchen this very
     day Will you dine with me

     CHIEFAnd moreover it is not well that all sorts of stuff
     should be put to dry in the courtroom and that over the very
     desk with the documents there should be a huntingwhip
     Yes and strange to say there is no man who has not his
     faults God himself has arranged it so and it is useless for
     freethinkers to maintain the contrary

     JUDGEWhat do you mean by faults Antn Antnitch There
     are various sorts of faults I tell every one frankly that I
     take bribes but what sort of bribes Greyhound pups Thats
     quite another thing

     CHIEFWell greyhound pups or anything else its all the
     same

     JUDGEWell no Antn Antnitch But for example if some
     one has a fur coat worth five hundred rubles and his wife has
     a shawl

     CHIEFWell and how about your taking greyhound pups as
     bribes Why dont you trust in God You never go to church I
     am firm in the faith at all events and go to church every
     Sunday But youoh I know you If you begin to talk about the
     creation ones hair rises straight up on his head

     JUDGEIt came of itself of its own accord

     CHIEFWell in some cases it is worse to have brains than to
     be entirely without them As for you Luk Lkitch as
     superintendent of schools you must bestir yourself with regard
     to the teachers One of them for instance the fatfaced
     oneI dont recall his namecannot get along without making
     grimaces when he takes his seatlike this makes a grimace
     and then he begins to smooth his beard out from under his
     neckerchief with his hand In short if he makes such faces at
     the scholars there is nothing to be said it must be
     necessary I am no judge as to that But just considerif he
     were to do that to a visitor it might be very unpleasant the
     Inspector or anyone else might take it as personal The Devil
     knows what might come of it And I must also mention the
     teacher of history Hes a learned man thats plain but he
     expresses himself with so much warmth that he loses control of
     himself I heard him once well so long as he was talking
     about the Assyrians and the Babylonians it was all right but
     when he got to Alexander of Macedon I cant describe to you
     what came over him I thought there was a fire by heavens He
     jumped up from his seat and dashed his chair down against the
     floor with all his might Alexander of Macedon was a hero no
     doubt but why smash the chairs There will be a deficit
     in the accounts just as the result of that

     SUPERINTENDENTYes he is hasty I have spoken to him about
     it several times He says What would you have I would
     sacrifice my life for science

     CHIEFYes such is the incomprehensible decree of Fate a
     learned man is always a drunkard or else he makes faces that
     would scare the very saints

As the play proceeds in this lively vein two men about townin a
humble waythe public busybodies happen to discover at the Inn a
traveler who has been living on credit for two weeks and going nowhere
The landlord is on the point of putting the man in prison for debt when
the busybodies jump to the conclusion that he is the Inspector The
Prefect and the other officials accept their suggestion in spite of the
travelers plain statement as to his own identity as an uninfluential
citizen They set about making the town presentable entertain him
bribe him against his will and bow down before him He enters into the
spirit of the thing after a brief delay accepts the hospitality asks
for loans makes love to the Prefects silly wife and daughter betroths
himself to the latter receives the petitions and the bribes of the
downtrodden townspeople and goes off with the best posthorses the town
can furnish ostensibly to ask the blessing of a rich old uncle on his
marriage The Postmaster intercepts a cynically frank letter which the
man has written to a friend and in which he heaps ridicule on his
credulous hosts This opens their eyes at last and at that moment a
gendarme appears and announces that the Inspector has arrived Tableau

Ggols two volumes of Little Russian Tales abovementioned must
remain classics and the volume of St Petersburg Tales contains
essentially the same ingredients so that they may be considered as a
whole All the tales in the first two volumes are from his beloved
native Little Russia Some are merely poetical renderings of popular
legends counterparts of which are to be found in the folklore of many
lands such are Vy and St Johns Eves and the exquisite May
Night where the famous poetical spirit of the Ukrana borderland is
displayed in its fullest force and beauty Know ye the night of the
Ukrana he writes O ye do not know the Ukrana night Look upon it
from the midst of the sky gazes the moon the illimitable vault of
heaven has withdrawn into the far distance has spread out still more
immeasurably it burns and breathes the earth is all bathed in silvery
light and the air is wondrous and cool and perfumed and full of
tenderness and an ocean of sweet odors is abroad A night divine An
enchanting night The forests stand motionless inspired full of
darkness and cast forth a vast shadow Calm and quiet are the pools
the coldness and gloom of their waters is morosely hemmed in by the dark
green walls of gardens The virgin copses of wild birdcherry and black
cherry trees stretch forth their roots towards the coolness of the
springs and from time to time their leaves whisper as though in anger
and indignation when a lovely little breeze and the wind of the night
creeping up for a moment kisses them All the landscape lies in
slumber But on high everything is breathing with life everything is
marvelous everything is solemnly triumphant And in the soul there is
something illimitable and wondrous and throngs of silvery visions make
their way into its depths Night divine Enchanting night And all of a
sudden everything has become instinct with life forests pools and
steppes The magnificent thunder of the Ukrana nightingale becomes
audible and one fancies that the moon in the midst of the sky has
paused to listen to it As though enchanted the hamlet dreams upon
the heights The mass of the cottages gleams still whiter still more
agreeably under the light of the moon still more dazzlingly do their
lowly walls stand out against the darkness The songs have ceased
Everything is still Pious people are all asleep Only here and there
are the small windows still aglow In front of the threshold of a few
cottages only is a belated family eating its late supper

Others of the tales are more exclusively national such as The Lost
Document Sortchinsky Fair The Enchanted Spot and the like But
they display the same fertility of invention combined with skill in
management and close study of everyday customs superstitions and
life all of which render them invaluable both to Russians and to
foreigners More important are such stories as Oldfashioned Gentry
The Cloak from the volume of St Petersburg Tales wherein kindly
wit is tempered with the purest deepest pathos while characters and
customs are depicted with the greatest art and fidelity The Portrait
again is semifantastic although not legendary and the Diary of a
Madman is unexcelled as an amusing but affecting study of a diseased
mind in the ranks of petty officialdom where the tedious insignificant
routine disperses what few wits the poor man was originally endowed with
by nature

In Ggols greatest work Dead Souls all his qualities are developed
to the highest degree though there is less pathos than in some of the
short stories This must forever rank as a Russian classic The types
are as vivid as faithful for those who know the Russia of today as
when they were first introduced to an enthusiastic Russian public in


In the preemancipation days a soul signified a male serf Women were
not taken account of in the periodical revisions although the working
unit or tyagl consisted of a man his wife and his horsethe
indispensable trinity in agricultural labors In the interval between
revisions a landed proprietor continued to pay taxes on all the male
serfs accredited to him on the official list births being considered as
an exact offset to deaths for the sake of convenience Another
provision of the law was that no one should purchase serfs without the
land to which they belonged except for the purpose of colonization An
ingenious fraud suggested by a combination of these two laws forms the
basis of plot for Dead Souls The hero Tchtchikoff is an official
who has struggled up cleverly but not too honestly through the devious
ways of bribetaking extortion and not infrequent detection and
disgrace to a snug berth in the customs service from which he has been
ejected under conditions which render further upward flight quite out of
the question In this dilemma he hits upon the idea of purchasing from
landed proprietors of mediocre probity all their souls which are dead
though still nominally alive and are taxed as such Land is being given
away gratuitously in the southern governments of Khersn and Taris to
any one who will settle on it This is a matter of public knowledge and
Tchtchikoffs plan consists in buying a thousand nonexistent
serfsdead soulsat a maximum of one hundred rubles apiece for
colonization on an equally nonexistent estate in the south He will
then mortgage them to the loan bank of the nobility known as the
Council of Guardians and obtain a capital In pursuance of this clever
scheme the adventurer sets out on his travels visits provincial towns
and the estates of landed gentry of every shade of character honesty
and financial standing and from them he buys for a song or cajoles
from them for nothing as a gift when they are a trifle scrupulous over
the tempting prospect of illegal gain huge numbers of dead souls
Pshkin himself could not have used with such tremendous effect the
phenomenal opportunities which this plot of Tchtchikoffs wanderings
offered for setting forth Russian manners characters customs all
Russian life in town and country as Ggol did The author even
contrives in keen asides and allusions to throw almost equal light on
the life of the capital as well His portraits of women are not exactly
failures they are more like composite photographs His portraiture of
men is supreme In fact there is no such thing in the whole of Ggols
work as a heroine properly speaking who plays a firstclass part or
who is analyzed in modern fashion The day was not come for that as yet

Tars Blba his great historical novel offers a vivid picture of the
famous kazk republic on the Dnipr and equally with his other volumes
it stands in the first rank for its poetry its dramatic force its
truth to life It alone may be said to have a passionate love story

CHAPTER IX

SEVENTH PERIOD GONTCHARFF GRIGORVITCH TURGNEFF


Under the direct influence of Byelnskys criticism and of the highly
artistic types created by Ggol a new generation of Russian writers
sprang up as has already been statedthe writers of the s
Grigorvitch Gontcharff Turgneff Ostrvsky Nekrsoff Dostovsky
Count L N Tolsty and many others With several of these we can deal
but briefly for while they stand high in the esteem of Russians they
are not accessible in English translations

Despite the numerous points which these writers of the s possessed
in common and which bound them together in one school this community
of interests did not prevent each one of them having his own definite
individuality his own conception of the world ideals character and
creative processes his own literary physiognomy so to speak which did
not in the least resemble the physiognomy of his fellowwriters but
presented a complete opposition to them in some respects Perhaps the
one who stands most conspicuously apart from the rest in this way is
Ivn Alexndrovitch Gontcharff  He was the son of a wealthy
landed proprietor in the southeastern government of Simbrsk pictures
of which district are reproduced in his most famous novel Oblmoff
This made its appearance in  No one who did not live in Russia at
that time can fully comprehend what an overwhelming sensation it
created It was like a bomb projected into the midst of cultivated
society at the moment when every one was profoundly affected by the
agitation which preceded the emancipation of the serfs  when the
literature of the day was engaged in preaching a crusade against
slumberous inactivity inertia and stagnation The special point about
Gontcharffs contribution to this crusade against the order of things
and in favor of progress was that no one could regard Oblmoff from
the objective point of view Every one was compelled to treat it
subjectively apply the type of the hero to his own case and admit that
in greater or less degree he possessed some of Oblmoffs
characteristics In this romance the gift of generalization reached its
highest point Oblmoff not only represented the type of the landed
proprietor as developed by the institution of serfdom but the racial
type which comprised the traits common to Russians in general without
regard to their social rank class or vocation In fact so typical was
this character that it furnished a new word to the language
oblmovshtchinathe state of being like Oblmoff Oblmoff carried
the national indolencekhaltnost or dressinggown laziness the
Russians call it in generalto such a degree that he not only was
unable to do anything but he was not able even to enjoy himself Added
to this he was afflicted with aristocratic enervation of his faculties
unhealthy timidity incapacity to take the smallest energetic effort
dovelike gentleness and tenderness of soul rendering him utterly
incapable of defending his own interests or happiness in the slightest
degree And these characteristics were recognized as appertaining to
Russians in general even to those who had never owned serfs and thus
the type presented by Oblmoff may be said to be not only racial but to
a certain extent universalone of the immortal types like Don Quixote
Don Juan Hamlet and the like The chief female character in the book
Olga can hardly be called the heroine she appears too briefly for
that But she is admitted to be a fine portrait of the Russian woman as
she was about to become not as she then existed Gontcharffs An
Everyday Story is also celebrated equally so is his The Ravine a
very distressing picture of the unprincipled character of an anarchist
As the author changed his mind about the hero in part while writing the
book it is not convincing

Another of the men who made his mark at this time was Dmtry
Vaslievitch Grigorvitch born in  who wrote a number of
brilliant books between  His chief merit is that he was the
first to begin the difficult study of the common people the first who
talked in literature about the peasants their needs their virtues
their helplessness their misfortunes and their sufferings Of his
early short stories Antn Goremka wretched fellow is the best In
it he is free from the reproach which was leveled at his later and more
ambitious long stories The Emigrants and The Fishermen In the
latter for the sake of lengthening the tale and of enlisting interest
by making it conform to the general taste of readers he made the
interest center on a lovestory in which the emotions and procedure
were described as being like those in the higher walks of life and this
did not agree with the facts of the case But the remainder of the
stories are founded on a genuine study of peasant ways and feelings
Grigorvitch had originally devoted himself to painting and after 
he returned to that profession but between  he again began to
publish stories

Among the writers who followed Grigorvitch in his studies of peasant
life was Ivn Sergyevitch Turgneff  who may be said not
only to have produced the most artistic pictures of that sphere ever
written by a Russian but to have summed up in his longer novels devoted
to the higher classes in a manner not to be surpassed and in a
language and style as polished and brilliant as a collection of precious
stonesa whole obscure period of changes and unrest He was descended
from an ancient noble family and his father served in a cuirassier
regiment On the family estate in the government of Orl where
later in life he laid the scene of his famous Notes of a Sportsman
he was well provided with teachers of various nationalitiesRussian
excepted One of his mothers serfs a man passionately fond of reading
and a great admirer of Kheraskff was the first to initiate the boy
into Russian literature with The Rossiad In  Turgneff entered
the Moscow University but soon went to St Petersburg and there
completed his course in the philological department Before he
graduated however he had begun to write and even to publish his
literary efforts After spending two years in Berlin to finish his
studies he returned to Moscow in  and there made acquaintance
with the Slavyanophilsthe Akskoffs Khomyakff a military man
chiefly known by his theological writings and others the leaders of
the new cult But Turgneff thoroughly imbued with western ideas did
not embrace it He entered the government service although there was no
necessity for his so doing but soon left it to devote himself entirely
to literature Byelnsky having written an enthusiastic article about a
poem which Turgneff had published under another name But poetry was
not Turgneffs strong point any more than was the drama though he
wrote a number of plays later on some of which have much merit and are
still acted occasionally He found his true path in  when the
success of his first sketch from peasant life Khor and Kalnitch
encouraged him to follow it up with more of the same sort the result
being the famous collection The Notes or Diary of a Sportsman
These together with numerous other short stories written between
 won for him great and permanent literary fame

The special strength of the school of the s consisted in its
combining in one organic and harmonious whole several currents of
literature which had hitherto flowed separately and suffered from
onesidedness The two chief currents were on the one hand the
objectivity of the Pshkin school artistic contemplation of everything
poetical in Russian life and on the other hand the negatively
satirical current of naturalism of the Ggol school whose principal
attention was directed to the imperfections of Russian life To these
were added by the writers of the s a socialmoral movement the
fermentation of ideas which is visible in the educated classes of
Russian society in the s and s As this movement was effected
under the influence of the French literature of the s and s of
which Victor Hugo and Georges Sand were the leading exponents whose
ideas were expressed under the form of romanticism these writers
exercised the most influence on the Russian writers of the immediately
succeeding period But it must be stated that their influence was purely
intellectual and moral and not in the least artistic in character The
influence of the French romanticists on the Russian writers of the s
consisted in the fact that the latter imbued with the ideas of the
former engaged in the analysis of Russian life which constitutes the
strength and the merit of the Russian literature of that epoch

Of all the Russian writers of that period Turgneff was indisputably
the greatest No one could have been more advantageously situated for
the study of the mutual relations between landed proprietors and serfs
The Turgneff family offered a very sharp type of oldfashioned
landedproprietor manners Not one gentle or heartfelt trait softened
the harshness of those manners which were based wholly upon merciless
despotism and weighed oppressively not only upon the peasants but upon
the younger members of the family Every one in the household was kept
in a perennial tremor of alarm and lived in hourly momentary
expectation of some savage punishment Moreover the authors father
who is depicted in the novel First Love was much younger than his
wife whom he did not love having married her for her money His
mothers portrait is to be found in Pnin and Babrin Extremely
unhappy in her childhood and youth when she got the chance at last she
became a pitiless despot greedy of power and indulged the caprices and
fantastic freaks suggested by her shattered nerves upon her family the
houseservants and the serfs It is but natural that from such an
experience as this Turgneff should have cherished from the time of
his miserable childhood his disagreements with his mother later in
life are matters of record also impressions which made of him the
irreconcilable foe of serfdom In depicting in his Notes of a
Sportsman the tyranny of the landed gentry over their serfs he could
have drawn upon his personal experience and the touching tale Mum
actually is the reproduction of an episode which occurred in his home
His Notes of a Sportsman constitutes a noteworthy historical monument
of the period not only as a work of the highest art but also as a
protest against serfdom In a way these stories form a worthy
continuation of Ggols Dead Souls In them as in all his other
stories at every step the reader encounters not only clearcut
portraits of persons but those enchanting pictures of nature for which
he is famous

The publication of his short sketches from peasant life in book
formNotes of a Sportsmanaroused great displeasure in official
circles officialdom looked askance upon Turgneff because also of his
long residence abroad Consequently when in  he published in a
Moscow newspaper a eulogistic article on Ggol when the latter died
which had been prohibited by the censor in St Petersburg the
authorities seized the opportunity to punish him He was arrested and
condemned to a month in jail which the daughter of the policeofficer
who had charge of him contrived to convert into residence in their
quarters where Turgneff wrote Mum and to residence on his estate
which he was not allowed to leave for about two years In  he went
abroad and thereafter he spent most of his time in Paris BadenBaden
later in Bougival returning from time to time to his Russian estate
During this period his talent attained its zenith and he wrote all the
most noteworthy works which assured him fame Rdin Faust A Nest
of Nobles On the Eve and First Love which alone would have
sufficed to immortalize him In  he published an article entitled
Hamlet and Don Quixote which throws a brilliant light upon the
characters of all his types and upon their inward springs of action
And at last in  came his famous Fathers and Children The key to
the comprehension of his works is contained in his Hamlet and Don
Quixote His idea is that in these two types are incarnated all the
fundamental contrasting peculiarities of the human raceboth poles of
the axis upon which it revolvesand that all people belong more or
less to one of these two types that every one of us inclines to be
either a Hamlet or a Don Quixote It is true he adds that in our
day the Hamlets have become far more numerous than the Don Quixotes but
the Don Quixotes have not died out nevertheless Such is his hero
Rdin that central type of the men of the sa man whose whole
vocation consists in the dissemination of enlightening ideas but who
at the same time exhibits the most complete incapacity in all his
attempts to realize those ideas in practice and scandalous
pusillanimity when there is a question of any step which is in the
slightest degree decisivea man of the head alone incapable of doing
anything himself because he has no nature no blood Such again is
Lavrtzky A Nest of Nobles that concentrated type not only of the
man from the best class of the landed gentry but in general of the
educated Slavonic mana man who is sympathetic in the highest degree
full of tenderness of gentle humanity and kindliness but who at the
same time does not contribute to life the smallest active principle
who passively yields to circumstances like a chip borne on the stormy
torrent Such are the majority of Turgneffs heroes beginning with the
hero of sya and ending with Snin in Spring Floods and
Litvnoff in Smoke Several Don Quixotes are to be found in his
works but not many and they are of two sorts One typically Russian
category includes Andri Klosoff and Ykoff Psinkoff Pnin and a
few others the second are Volntzeff and Uvr Ivnovitch in On the
Eve A third type invented by Turgneff as an offset to the Hamlets
is represented by Insroff in On the Eve

With the publication in  of Fathers and Children a fateful
crisis occurred in Turgneffs career In his memoirs and in his letters
he insists that in the character of Bazroff he had no intention of
writing a caricature on the young generation and of bearing himself in
a negative manner towards it My entire novel he writes is directed
against the nobility as the leading class Nevertheless the book
raised a tremendous storm His mistake lay in not recognizing in the new
type of men depicted under the character of Bazroff enthusiasts endowed
with all the merits and defects of people of that sort but on the
contrary they impressed him as skeptics rejecters of all conventions
and he christened them with the name of nihilists which was the cause
of the whole uproar as he himself admitted But he declares that he
employed the word not as a reproach or with the aim of insulting but
merely as an accurate and rational expression of an historical fact
which had made its appearance

Turgneff always regarded himself as a pupil of Pshkin and a worthy
pupil he was but he worked out his own independent style and in turn
called forth a horde of imitators It may be said of Turgneff that he
created the artistic Russian novel carrying it to the pitch of
perfection in the matter of elegance and finely proportioned exposition
and arrangement of its partsits architecture so to speakcombined
with artless simplicity and realism The peculiarity of Turgneffs
style consists in the remarkable softness and tenderness of its tones
combined with a certain mistiness of coloring which recalls the air and
sky of central Russia Not a single harsh or coarse line is to be found
in Turgneffs work not a single glaring hue The objects depicted do
not immediately start forth before you in full proportions but are
gradually depicted in a mass of small details with all the most delicate
shades Turgneff is most renowned artistically for the landscapes which
are scattered through his works and principally portray the nature of
his native locality central Russia Equally famous and executed with
no less mastery and art are his portrayal and analysis of the various
vicissitudes of the tender passion and in this respect he was regarded
as a connoisseur of the feminine heart A special epithet the bard of
love was often applied to him Along with a series of masculine types
Turgneffs works present a whole gallery of Russian women of the s
and s portrayed in a matchless manner with the touch of absolute
genius And it is a fact worth noting that in his works as in those of
all the authors of the s the women stand immeasurably higher than
the men The heroines are frequently set forth in all their moral
grandeur as though with the express intention of overshadowing the
insignificance of the heroes who are placed beside them

Towards the beginning of the s the germs of pessimism began to make
their appearance in Turgneffs work and its final expression came in
Poems in Prose The source of this pessimism must be sought in his
whole past beginning with the impressions of his childhood and the
disintegrating influence of the reaction of the s when the nations
hopes of various reforms seemed to have been blighted and ending with a
whole mass of experiences of life and the literary failures and
annoyances which he underwent during the second half of his life And in
this connection it must not be forgotten that the very spirit of
analysis and skepticism wherewith the school of writers of the s is
imbued leads straight to pessimism like any other sort of skepticism

The following specimen from The Notes of a Sportsman is selected
chiefly for its comparative brevity

THE WOLF

     I was driving from the chase one evening alone in a racing
     gig I was about eight versts from my house my good mare
     was stepping briskly along the dusty road snorting and
     twitching her ears from time to time my weary dog never
     quitted the hind wheels as though he were tied there A
     thunderstorm was coming on In front of me a huge purplish
     cloud was slowly rising from behind the forest overhead and
     advancing to meet me floated long gray clouds the willows
     were rustling and whispering with apprehension The stifling
     heat suddenly gave way to a damp chill the shadows swiftly
     thickened I slapped the reins on the horses back descended
     into a ravine crossed a dry brook all overgrown with
     scrubwillows ascended the hill and drove into the forest
     The road in front of me wound along among thick clumps of
     hazelbushes and was already inundated with gloom I advanced
     with difficulty My gig jolted over the firm roots of the
     centenarian oaks and lindens which incessantly intersected the
     long deep rutsthe traces of cartwheels my horse began to
     stumble A strong wind suddenly began to drone up above the
     trees grew turbulent big drops of rain clattered sharply and
     splashed on the leaves the lightning and thunder burst forth
     the rain poured in torrents I drove at a footpace and was
     speedily compelled to halt my horse stuck fast I could not
     see a single object I sheltered myself after a fashion under a
     widespreading bush Bent double with my face wrapped up I
     was patiently awaiting the end of the storm when suddenly by
     the gleam of a lightningflash it seemed to me that I descried
     a tall figure on the road I began to gaze attentively in that
     directionthe same figure sprang out of the earth as it were
     beside my gig

     Who is this asked a sonorous voice

     Who are you yourself

     Im the forester here

     I mentioned my name

     Ah I know you are on your way home

     Yes But you see what a storm

     Yes it is a thunderstorm replied the voice A white flash
     of lightning illuminated the forester from head to foot a
     short crashing peal of thunder resounded immediately
     afterwards The rain poured down with redoubled force

     It will not pass over very soon continued the forester

     What is to be done

     Ill conduct you to my cottage if you like he said
     abruptly

     Pray do

     Please take your seat

     He stepped to the mares head took her by the bit and turned
     her from the spot We set out I clung to the cushion of the
     drzhky which rocked like a skiff at sea and called the dog
     My poor mare splashed her feet heavily through the mire
     slipped stumbled the forester swayed from right to left in
     front of the shafts like a specter Thus we proceeded for
     rather a long time At last my guide came to a halt Here we
     are at home master he said in a calm voice A wicket gate
     squeaked several puppies began to bark all together I raised
     my head and by the glare of the lightning I descried a tiny
     hut in the center of a spacious yard surrounded with wattled
     hedge From one tiny window a small light cast a dull gleam
     The forester led the horse up to the porch and knocked at the
     door Right away right away resounded a shrill little
     voice and the patter of bare feet became audible the bolt
     screeched and a little girl about twelve years of age clad
     in a miserable little chemise girt about with a bit of list
     and holding a lantern in her hand made her appearance on the
     threshold

     Light the gentleman he said to herand I will put your
     carriage under the shed

     The little lass glanced at me and entered the cottage I
     followed her The foresters cottage consisted of one room
     smokebegrimed lowceiled and bare without any sleepingshelf
     over the oven and without any partitions a tattered sheepskin
     coat hung against the wall On the wallbench hung a
     singlebarreled gun in the corner lay scattered a heap of
     rags two large pots stood beside the oven A pineknot was
     burning on the table sputtering mournfully and on the point
     of dying out Exactly in the middle of the room hung a cradle
     suspended from the end of a long pole The little maid
     extinguished the lantern seated herself on a tiny bench and
     began to rock the cradle with her left hand while with her
     right she put the pineknot to rights I looked about me and
     my heart grew sad within me it is not cheerful to enter a
     peasants hut by night The baby in the cradle was breathing
     heavily and rapidly

     Is it possible that thou art alone here I asked the little
     girl

     Yes she uttered almost inaudibly

     Art thou the foresters daughter

     Yes she whispered

     The door creaked and the forester stepped across the
     threshold bending his head as he did so He picked up the
     lantern from the floor went to the table and ignited the
     wick

     Probably you are not accustomed to a pineknot he said as
     he shook his curls

     I looked at him Rarely has it been my fortune to behold such a
     fine dashing fellow He was tall of stature broadshouldered
     and splendidly built From beneath his dripping shirt which
     was open on the breast his mighty muscles stood prominently
     forth A curly black beard covered half of his surly and manly
     face from beneath his broad eyebrows which met over his nose
     small brown eyes gazed bravely forth He set his hands lightly
     on his hips and stood before me

     I thanked him and asked his name

     My name is Fom he repliedbut my nickname is The
     Wolf

     Ah are you The Wolf

     I gazed at him with redoubled curiosity From my Ermol and
     from others I had often heard about the forester The Wolf
     whom all the peasants round about feared like fire According
     to their statements never before had there existed in the
     world such a master of his business He gives no one a chance
     to carry off trusses of brushwood no matter what the hour may
     be even at midnight he drops down like snow on ones head
     and you need not think of offering resistancehes as strong
     and as crafty as the Devil And its impossible to catch him
     by any means neither with liquor nor with money he wont
     yield to any allurement More than once good men have made
     preparations to put him out of the world but no he doesnt
     give them a chance

     That was the way the neighboring peasants expressed themselves
     about The Wolf

     So thou art The Wolf I repeated Ive heard of you
     brother They say that thou givest no quarter to any one

     I perform my duty he replied surlily it is not right to
     eat the masters bread for nothing

     He pulled his axe from his girdle sat down on the floor and
     began to chop a pineknot

     Hast thou no housewife I asked him

     No he replied and brandished his axe fiercely

     She is dead apparently

     Noyesshe is dead he added and turned away

     I said nothing he raised his eyes and looked at me

     She ran away with a petty burgher who came along he
     remarked with a harsh smile The little girl dropped her eyes
     the baby waked up and began to cry the girl went to the
     cradle There give it to him said The Wolf thrusting into
     her hand a soiled horn And she abandoned him he went
     on in a low tone pointing at the baby He went to the door
     paused and turned round

     Probably master he began you cannot eat our bread and I
     have nothing but bread

     I am not hungry

     Well suit yourself I would boil the samovr for you only I
     have no tea Ill go and see how your horse is

     He went out and slammed the door I surveyed my surroundings
     The hut seemed to me more doleful than before The bitter odor
     of chilled smoke oppressed my breathing The little girl did
     not stir from her place and did not raise her eyes from time
     to time she gave the cradle a gentle shove or timidly hitched
     up on her shoulder her chemise which had slipped down her bare
     legs hung motionless

     What is thy name I asked

     Ulta she said drooping her sad little face still lower

     The forester entered and seated himself on the wallbench

     The thunderstorm is passing over he remarked after a brief
     pause if you command I will guide you out of the forest

     I rose The Wolf picked up the gun and inspected the priming

     What is that for I inquired

     They are stealing in the forest Theyre felling a tree at the
     Hares Ravine he added in reply to my inquiring glance

     Can it be heard from here

     It can from the yard

     We went out together The rain had ceased Heavy masses of
     cloud were piled up in the distance long streaks of lightning
     flashed forth from time to time but over our heads the dark
     blue sky was visible here and there little stars twinkled
     through the thin swiftly flying clouds The outlines of the
     trees besprinkled with rain and fluttered by the wind were
     beginning to stand out from the gloom We began to listen The
     forester took off his cap and dropped his eyes Thethere
     he said suddenly and stretched out his arm you see what a
     night they have chosen

     I heard nothing except the rustling of the leaves The Wolf led
     my horse out from under the shed But I shall probably let
     them slip this way he added aloudIll go with you shall
     IAll right he replied and backed the horse Well
     catch him in a trice and then Ill guide you out Come on

     We set out The Wolf in advance I behind him God knows how he
     found the road but he rarely halted and then only to listen
     to the sound of the axe You see he muttered between his
     teeth You hear do you hear But where The Wolf shrugged
     his shoulders We decended into a ravine the wind died down
     for an instant measured blows clearly reached my ear The Wolf
     glanced at me and shook his head We went on over the wet
     ferns and nettles A dull prolonged roar rang out

     He has felled it muttered The Wolf

     In the meantime the sky had continued to clear it was almost
     light in the forest We made our way out of the ravine at last
     Wait here the forester whispered to me bent over and
     raising his gun aloft vanished among the bushes I began to
     listen with strained intentness Athwart the constant noise of
     the wind I thought I discerned faint sounds not far away an
     axe was cautiously chopping on branches a horse was snorting

     Where art thou going Halt the iron voice of The Wolf
     suddenly thundered out Another voice cried out plaintively
     like a hare A struggle began Thou liiest Thou
     liiest repeated The Wolf panting thou shalt not escape
      I dashed forward in the direction of the noise and ran to
     the scene of battle stumbling at every step Beside the felled
     tree on the earth the forester was moving about he held the
     thief beneath him and was engaged in tying the mans hands
     behind his back with his girdle I stepped up The Wolf rose
     and set him on his feet I beheld a peasant soaked in rags
     with a long disheveled beard A miserable little nag
     halfcovered with a small stiff mat stood hard by with the
     runninggear of a cart The forester uttered not a word the
     peasant also maintained silence and merely shook his head

     Let him go I whispered in The Wolfs ear I will pay for
     the tree

     The Wolf without replying grasped the horses foretop with
     his left hand with his right he held the thief by the belt
     Come move on simpleton he ejaculated surlily

     Take my axe yonder muttered the peasant Why should it be
     wasted said the forester and picked up the axe We started
     I walked in the rear The rain began to drizzle again and
     soon was pouring in torrents With difficulty we made our way
     to the cottage The Wolf turned the captured nag loose in the
     yard led the peasant into the house loosened the knot of the
     girdle and seated him in the corner The little girl who had
     almost fallen asleep by the oven sprang up and with dumb
     alarm began to stare at us I seated myself on the wallbench

     Ekh what a downpour remarked the forester We must wait
     until it stops Wouldnt you like to lie down

     Thanks

     I would lock him up in the lumberroom on account of your
     grace he went on pointing to the peasant but you see the
     bolt

     Leave him there dont touch him I interrupted The Wolf

     The peasant cast a sidelong glance at me I inwardly registered
     a vow that I would save the poor fellow at any cost He sat
     motionless on the wallbench By the light of the lantern I was
     able to scrutinize his dissipated wrinkled face his pendant
     yellow eyebrows his thin limbs The little girl lay down on
     the floor at his very feet and fell asleep again The Wolf
     sat by the table with his head propped on his hands A
     grasshopper chirped in one corner The rain beat down upon
     the roof and dripped down the windows we all maintained
     silence

     Fom Kzmitch began the peasant suddenly in a dull cracked
     voice hey there Fom Kzmitch

     What do you want

     Let me go

     The Wolf made no reply

     Let me go  hunger drove me to it  let me go

     I know you retorted the forester grimly Youre all alike
     in your village a pack of thieves

     Let me go repeated the peasant The head clerk  were
     ruined thats what it is  let me go

     Ruined No one ought to steal

     Let me go Fom Kzmitch  dont destroy me Thy master as
     thou knowest will devour me so he will

     The Wolf turned aside The peasant was twitching all over as
     though racked with fever He kept shaking his head and he
     breathed irregularly

     Let me go he repeated with melancholy despair Let me go
     for Gods sake let me go I will pay that I will by God By
     God hunger drove me to it  the children are squalling thou
     knowest thyself how it is Its hard on a man that it is

     All the same dont go athieving

     My horse continued the peasant theres my horse take it
     if you choose  its my only beast  let me go

     Impossible I tell thee I also am a subordinate I shall be
     held responsible And it isnt right either to connive at thy
     deed

     Let me go Poverty Fom Kzmitch poverty thats what it is
      let me go

     I know thee

     But let me go

     Eh whats the use of arguing with you sit still or Ill give
     it to you dont you know Dont you see the gentleman

     The poor fellow dropped his eyes The Wolf yawned and laid
     his head on the table The rain had not stopped I waited to
     see what would happen

     The peasant suddenly straightened himself up His eyes began to
     blaze and the color flew to his face Well go ahead devour
     Go ahead oppress Go ahead he began screwing up his eyes
     and dropping the corners of his lips go ahead accursed
     murderer of the soul drink Christian blood drink

     The forester turned round

     Im talking to thee to thee Asiatic blooddrinker to thee

     Art thou drunk that thou hast taken it into thy head to
     curse said the forester with amazement Hast thou gone
     crazy

     Drunk It wasnt on thy money accursed soulmurderer wild
     beast beast beast

     Akh thou  Ill give it to thee

     What do I care Its all one to meI shall perish anyway

     thing whether with hunger or thus it makes no difference
     Deuce take them all wife childrenlet them all perish
     But just wait thou shalt hear from us

     The Wolf halfrose to his feet

     Kill kill the peasant began again in a savage voice
     Kill go ahead kill The little girl sprang up from the
     floor and riveted her eyes on him Kill kill

     Hold thy tongue thundered the forester and advanced a
     couple of strides

     Enough that will do Fom I shoutedlet him alone
     Dont bother with him

     I wont hold my tongue went on the unfortunate man It
     makes no difference how he murders me Thou soulmurderer thou
     wild beast hanging is too good for thee But just wait
     Thou hast not long to vaunt thyself Theyll strangle thy
     throat for thee Just wait a bit

     The Wolf seized him by the shoulder I rushed to the rescue
     of the peasant

     Dont touch us master the forester shouted at me

     I did not fear his threats and was on the point of stretching
     out my arm but to my extreme amazement with one twist he
     tore the girdle from the peasants elbow seized him by the
     collar banged his cap down over his eyes flung open the door
     and thrust him out

     Take thyself and thy horse off to the devil he shouted after
     him and see here another time Ill

     He came back into the cottage and began to rake over the
     ashes

     Well Wolf I said at last you have astonished me I see
     that you are a splendid young fellow

     Ekh stop that master he interrupted me with vexation
     Only please dont tell about it Now Id better show you your
     way he added because you cant wait for the rain to stop

     The wheels of the peasants cart rumbled through the yard

     You see he has dragged himself off he muttered but Ill
     give it to him

     Half an hour later he bade me farewell on the edge of the
     forest

CHAPTER X

SEVENTH PERIOD OSTRVSKY A K TOLSTY POLNSKY NEKRSOFF
SHEVTCHNKO AND OTHERS


The new impulse imparted to all branches of literature in Russia during
the s and the s could not fail to find a reflection in the
fortunes of the drama also Nowhere is the spirit of the period more
clearly set forth than in the history of the Russian theater by the
creation of an independent Russian stage

Russian comedy had existed from the days of Sumarkoff as we have seen
and had included such great names as Von Vzin Griboydoff and Ggol
But great as were the works of these authors they cannot be called its
creators in the true sense of the word because their plays were like
oases far apart separated by great intervals of time and left behind
them no established school Although Von Vzins comedies contain much
that is independent and original they are fashioned after the models of
the French stage as is apparent at every step Woe from Wit counts
rather as a specimen of talented social satire than as a model comedy
and in its type this comedy of Griboydoff also bears the imprint of
the French stage Ggols comedies despite their great talent left
behind them no followers and had no imitators In the s and the
s the repertory of the Russian theater consisted of plays which had
nothing in common with Woe from Wit The Inspector or Marriage
and the latter was rarely played As a whole the stage was given over
to translations of sensational French melodramas and to patriotic
tragedies

The man who changed all this and created Russian drama Alexnder
Nikolevitch Ostrvsky  was born in Moscow the son of a
poor lawyer whose business lay with the merchant class of the
TransMoscow River quarter of the type which we meet with in Alexnder
Nikolevitchs celebrated comedies The future dramatist who spent most
of his life in Moscow was most favorably placed to observe the varied
characteristics of Russian life and also Russian historical types for
Moscow in the s and s of the nineteenth century was the focus
of all Russia and contained within its walls all the historical and
contemporary peculiarities of the nation On leaving the University
where he did not finish the course in  Ostrvsky entered the
civil service in the commercial court where he enjoyed further
opportunities of enlarging his observations on the life of the
TransMoscow quarter In  he made his first appearance in
literature with Scenes of Family Happiness in Moscow which was
printed in a Moscow newspaper Soon afterwards he printed in the same
paper several scenes from his comedy Svo lidisotchtymsya which
may be freely translated Its All in the Family Well Settle It Among
Ourselves This gained him more reputation and he resigned from the
service to devote himself entirely to literature as proofreader
writer of short articles and so forth earning a miserably small
salary When the comedy just mentioned was printed in  it bore the
title of The Bankrupt and was renamed in deference to the objections
of the censor It made a tremendous commotion in Russian society where
it was read aloud almost daily and one noted man remarked of it It
was not written it was born But the Moscow merchants took umbrage at
the play made complaints in the proper quarter and the author was
placed under police supervision while the newspapers were forbidden to
mention the comedy Naturally it was not acted The following summary
will not only indicate the reason therefor and for the wrath of the
merchants but will also afford an idea of his style in the first comedy
which was acted his famous Dont Seat Yourself in a Sledge Which is
not Yours Shoemaker Stick to Your Last is the English equivalent
produced in  and in others

ITS ALL IN THE FAMILY WELL SETTLE IT AMONG OURSELVES

     Samsn Slitch Bolshff Samson son of Strong Big a Moscow
     merchant has a daughter Olympida otherwise known as
     Lpotchka

     Lpotchka has been highly educated according to the ideas of
     the merchant class considers herself a lady and despises her
     parents and their coarse ways This remarkable education
     consists in a smattering of the customary feminine
     accomplishments especial value being attached to a knowledge
     of French which is one mark of the gentry in Russia

     Like all merchants daughters who have been educated above
     their sphere Lpotchka aspires to marry a noble preferably a
     military man The play opens with a soliloquy by Lpotchka who
     meditates upon the pleasures of the dance

     What an agreeable occupation these dances are Just think how
     fine What can be more entrancing You enter an assembly or
     some ones wedding you sit down naturally you are all decked
     with flowers you are dressed up like a doll or like a picture
     in a paper suddenly a cavalier flies up Will you grant me
     the happiness madam Well you see if he is a man with
     understanding or an army officer you halfclose your eyes
     and reply With pleasure Ah Chaaarming It is simply
     beyond comprehension I no longer like to dance with students
     or shopclerks Tis quite another thing to distinguish
     yourself with military men Ah how delightful How enchanting
     And their mustaches and their epaulets and their uniforms
     and some even have spurs with bells I am amazed that so
     many women should sit with their feet tucked up under them
     Really it is not at all difficult to learn Here am I who was
     ashamed to take a teacher I have learned everything
     positively everything in twenty lessons Why should not one
     learn to dance It is pure superstition Here is mama who used
     to get angry because the teacher was always clutching at my
     knees That was because she is not cultured Of what importance
     is it Hes only the dancingmaster

     Lpotchka proceeds to picture to herself that she receives a
     proposal from an officer and that he thinks she is uneducated
     because she gets confused She has not danced for a year and a
     half and decides to practice a little As she is dancing her
     mother enters and bids her to stopdancing is a sin
     Lpotchka refuses and an acrimonious wrangle ensues between
     mother and daughter about things in general The mother
     reproaches Lpotchka for her ways reminds her that her parents
     have educated her and so forth To this Lpotchka retorts that
     other people have taught her all she knowsand why have her
     parents refused that gentleman of good birth who has asked for
     her hand Is he not a Cupid she pronounces it Capid There
     is no living with them and so forth The female matchmaker
     comes to inform them how she is progressing in her search for a
     proper match for Lpotchka and the latter declares stoutly
     that she will never marry a merchant The matchmaker a famous
     figure in old Russia life and irresistibly comic on the stage
     habitually addresses her clients as my silver ones my
     golden ones my emerald ones my brilliant or diamond
     ones which she pronounces bralliant Matters are nearly
     arranged for Lpotchkas marriage with a man of good birth

     Old Bolshff however is represented as being in a financial
     position where he can take his choice between paying all his
     debts and being thus left penniless but honest and paying his
     creditors nothing or at most a quarter of their dues and
     remaining rich enough to indulge in the luxury of a noble
     soninlaw the only motive on whose part for such a marriage
     being naturally the brides dowry

     Old Bolshff decides to defraud his creditors with the aid of
     a pettifogging lawyer and he makes over all his property to
     his clerk Podkhalizin The latter has long sighed for
     Lpotchka but his personal repulsiveness added to his
     merchant rank has prevented his ever daring to hint at such a
     thing Now however he sees his chance He promises the legal
     shyster a round sum if he will arrange matters securely in his
     favor He bribes the matchmaker to get rid of the noble
     suitor and to bring about his marriage with Lpotchka
     promising her in case of success two thousand rubles and a
     sablelined cloak

     Matters have gone so far that Lpotchka is gorgeously arrayed
     to receive her nobly born suitor and accept him Her mother is
     feasting her eyes on her adored child in one of the intervals
     of her grumbling and bickering with her ungrateful offspring
     and warning the dear idol not to come in contact with the door
     and crush her finery But the matchmaker announces that the
     man has beaten a retreat Lpotchka falls in a swoon Her
     father declares that there is no occasion for that as he has a
     suitable match at hand He calls in Podkhalizin whom
     Lpotchka despises and presents him commanding his daughter
     to wed Lpotchka flatly refuses But after a private interview
     with the ambitious clerk in which the latter informs her that
     she no longer possesses a dowry wherewith to attract a noble
     suitor and in which he promises that she shall have the
     greatest liberty and be indulged in any degree of extravagance
     she consents

     The marriage takes place But old Bolshff has been put in
     prison by his enraged creditors while the young couple have
     been fitting up a new house in gorgeous style on the old
     merchants money The pettifogging lawyer comes for his
     promised reward Podkhalizin cheats him out of it The
     matchmaker comes for her two thousand rubles and sablelined
     cloak and gets one hundred rubles and a cheap gown As these
     people depart cursing old Bolshff is brought in by his guard
     He has come to entreat his wealthy soninlaw to pay the
     creditors twentyfive per cent and so release him from prison
     Podkhalizin declares that this is impossible the old man has
     given him his instructions to pay only ten per cent and
     really he cannot afford to pay more The old mans darling
     Lpotchka joins in and supports her husbands plea that they
     positively cannot afford more The old man is taken back to
     prison preliminary to being sent to Siberia as a fraudulent
     bankrupt The young couple take the matter quite coolly until
     the policeman comes to carry off Podkhalizin to prison for
     collusion Even then the rascally exclerk does not lose his
     coolness and when informed by the policemanin answer to his
     question as to what is to become of himthat he will probably
     be sent to Siberia Well if it is to be Siberia Siberia let
     it be What of that People live in Siberia also Evidently
     there is no escape I am ready

Although Shoemaker Stick to Your Last the central idea of which is
that girls of the merchant class will be much happier if they marry in
their own class than if they wed nobles who take them solely for their
money the usual reason for such alliances even at the present day
had an immense success both in Moscow and in St Petersburg Ostrvsky
received not a penny from it In the latter city also the censor took
a hand because the nobility was put to shame for the benefit of the
merchant class and the theater management was greatly agitated when
the Emperor and all the imperial family came to the first performance
But the Emperor remarked There are very few plays which have given me
so much pleasure it is not a play it is a lesson

The Poor Bride written in  was then put on the stage and the
author received a small payment on the spot In  Poverty is not a
Vice appeared and confirmed the authors standing as a writer of the
first class This play a great favorite still contains many
presentations of old Russian customs It was the first from which the
author received a regular royalty ranging from onetwentieth to
twothirds of the profits

After many more comedies all more or less noted all more or less
objected to by the censor for various reasons and hostility and bad
treatment on the part of the theatrical authorities Ostrvsky attained
the zenith of his literary fame with his masterpiece Groz The
Thunderstorm It was not until  in his comedy A Drunken Headache
from Another Mans Banquet meaning to bear anothers trouble that
Ostrvsky invented the words which have passed into the language
samodr and samodrstvo which mean literally selffool and the
state of being a selffool The original selffool is Tit Tititch
Bruskff provincially pronounced Kit Kititch in the play but no
better example of the pigheaded obstinate selfcomplacent
vociferous intolerable tyrant which constitutes the selffool can be
desired than that offered in The Thunderstorm by Mrfa Igntievna
Kabnoff the rich merchants widow She rules her son Tkhon and his
wife Katerna with a rod of iron Her daughter Varvra gets along
with her by consistent deceitfulness and meets her lover Kudrysh
whenever she pleases Tkhon goes off for a short time on business and
anxious to enjoy a little freedom he persistently refuses to take his
wife with him despite her urgent entreaties She makes the request
because she feels that she is falling in love with Bors

After his departure Varvra takes charge of her fate and persuades her
to indulge her affection and to see Bors Katerna eventually yields to
Varvras representations A halfmad old lady who wanders about
attended by a couple of lackeys has previously frightened the sensitive
Katerna who was reared amid family affection and cannot understand or
endure the tyranny of her motherinlaw by vague predictions and
threats of hell and when a thunderstorm suddenly breaks over the
assembled family after her husbands return and the weird old lady
again makes her appearance Katerna is fairly crazed She thinks the
terrible punishment for her wayward affections has arrived she
confesses to her husband and motherinlaw that she loves Bors Spurned
by the latterthough the husband is not inclined to attach overmuch
importance to what she says in her startled conditionshe rushes off
and drowns herself The savage motherinlaw who is to blame for the
entire tragedy sternly commands her son not to mourn for his dead wife
whom he has loved in the feeble way which such a tyrant has permitted
This outline gives hardly an idea of the force of the play and its
value as a picture of Russian manners of the old school in general and
of the merchant class who retained them long after they were much
ameliorated in other classes of society in particular

But Ostrvsky did not confine his dramas within narrow limits On the
contrary they present a wonderfully broad panorama of Russian life and
attain to a universality which has been reached by no other Russian
writer save Pshkin and Count L N Tolsty There are plays from
prehistoric mythical times and historical plays which deal with
prominent epochs in the life of the nation A great favorite partly
because of its pictures of old Russian customs is The Voevda or
The Dream on the Volga  Vasilsa Melntieff is popular for
the same reasons  Ostrvskys nervous organization was broken
down by the incessant toil necessary to support his family and these
historical plays were written with others to relieve the pressure His
dramas were given all over Russia and he received more money from
private than from the government theaters But towards the end of his
life comfort came and during the last year of his life he was in charge
of the Moscow government Theater At last he was master of the Russian
stage and established a school of dramatic art on the lines laid down
by himself But the toil was too great for his shattered health and he
died in  His plays are wonderfully rich as a portraitgallery of
contemporary types as well as of historical types and the language of
his characters is one of the most surprising features of his work It is
far too little to say of it that it is natural and fits the characters
presented in nationality in figurativeness in keen unfeigned humor
and wit it represents the richest treasure of the Russian speech Only
three writers are worthy of being ranked together in this respect
Pshkin Krylff and Ostrvsky

While like all the writers of the s Ostrvsky is the pupil of
Ggol he created his own school and attained an independent position
from his very first piece His plays have only one thing in common with
Ggolshe draws his scenes from commonplace everyday life in Russia
his characters are unimportant everyday people Ggols comedies were
such in the strict meaning of the word and their object was to cast
ridicule on the acting personages to bring into prominence the absurd
sides of their characters and this aim accomplished the heroes leave
the stage without having undergone any change in their fates With
Ostrvskys comedies it is entirely different The author is not felt in
them The persons of the drama talk and act in defiance of him so to
speak as they would talk and act in real life and decided changes in
their fate take place But Ostrvsky accomplished far more than the
creation of a Russian theater he brought the stage to the highest pitch
of ideal realism and discarded all ancient traditions The subjects of
his plays are distinguished for their classic simplicity life itself
flows slowly across the stage as though the author had demolished a
wall and were exhibiting the actual life within the house His plays
like life break off short after the climax with some insignificant
scene generally between personages of secondary rank and he tries to
convince the audience that in life there are no beginnings no endings
that there is no moment after which one would venture to place a full
period Moreover they are plays of life rather than either comedies
or tragedies as he chanced to label them they are purely
presentations of life In their scope they include almost every phase of
Russian life except peasant and country life which he had no chance to
study

For the sake of convenience we may group the other dramatic writers
here The conditions under which the Russian stage labored were so
difficult that the best literary talent was turned into other channels
and the very few plays which were fitted to vie with Ostrvskys came
from the pens of men whose chief work belonged to other branches of
literature Thus Ivn Sergyevitch Turgneff who wrote more for the
stage than other contemporary writers and whose plays fill one volume
of his collected works distinguished himself far more in other lines
Yet several of these plays hold the first place after Ostrvskys The
Boarder  Breakfast at the Marshal of Nobilitys  The
Bachelor  A Month in the Country  The Woman from the
Rural Districts  are still acted and enjoyed by the public

Alexi Feofilktovitch Psemsky best known for his Thousand Souls and
his Troubled Sea romances of a depressing sort contributed to the
stage a play called A Bitter Fate among others wherein the Russian
peasant appeared for the first time in natural guise without
idealization or any decoration whatever

Count Alexi Konstantnovitch Tolsty  wrote a famous trilogy
of historical plays The Death of Ivn the Terrible  Tzar
Fedor Ivnovitch  and Tzar Bors  The above are the
dates of their publication They appeared on the stage the first in
 the other two in  though they had been privately acted at the
Hermitage Theater in the Winter Palace long before that date They are
fine reading plays offering a profound study of history but the epic
element preponderates over the dramatic element and the characters set
forth their sentiments in extremely long monologues and conversations
There have been many other dramatic writers but none of great
distinction

                                   

Count A K Tolsty stood at the head of the school of purely artistic
poets who claimed that they alone were the faithful preservers of the
Pshkin tradition But in this they were mistaken Pshkin drew his
subjects from life they shut themselves up in sthetic contemplation
of the beautiful forms of classical art of ancient and modern times and
isolated themselves from life in general The result was that they
composed poetry of an abstract artistically dainty elegantly
rhetorical sort whose chief defect lay in its lack of individuality
and the utter absence of all colors sounds and motives by which
Russian nationality and life are conveyed The poetry of this school
contains no sharply cut features of spiritual physiognomy All of them
flow together into a featureless mass of elegantly stereotyped forms and
sounds

Count A K Tolsty who enjoyed all the advantages of education and
travel abroad where he made acquaintance with Goethe began to
scribble verses at the age of six he says in his autobiography Born in
 he became Master of the Hounds at the imperial court in  and
died in  He made his literary debut in  with prose tales and
only in  did he publish his lyric and epic verses in various
newspapers His best poetical efforts beautiful as they are in external
form are characterless and remind one of Zhukvskys in that they
were influenced by foreign or Russian poetsLrmontoff for instance
But they have not a trace of genuine unaffected feeling of vivid
burning passion of inspiration His best work is his prose historical
romance Prince Serbryany which gives a lively and faithful picture
of Ivn the Terrible his court and life in his day The dramas already
mentioned are almost if not equally famous in Russia though less known
abroad Prince Serbryany and War and Peace by the former authors
more illustrious cousin Count L N Tolsty are the best historical
novels in the Russian language

Another poet of this period was Apolln Nikolevitch Mikoff born in
 the son of a wellknown painter During his first period he gave
himself up to classical bloodless poems of which one of the most noted
is Two Worlds which depicts the clash of heathendom and Christianity
at the epoch of the fall of Rome This poem he continued to write all
his life the prologue Three Deaths begun in  was not finished
until  To this period also belong Two Judgments Sketches of
Rome Anacreon Alcibiades and so forth His second and best
period began in  when he abandoned his cold classicism and wrote
his best works Clermont Cathedral Savonarola Foolish Dnya
The Last Heathens Plya The Little Picture and a number of
beautiful translations from Heine

Still another poet was Afansy Afansievitch Shnshin who wrote under
the name of Fet Born in  he began to write at the age of nineteen
About that time on entering the Moscow University he experienced some
difficulty in furnishing the requisite documents whereupon he assumed
the name of his mother during her first marriageFet He reacquired his
own name Shnshin in  by presenting the proper documents
whereupon an imperial order restored it to him From  to  he
served in the army continuing to write poetry the while Before his
death in  he published numerous volumes of poems translations
from the classics and so forth Less talented than Count Alexi K
Tolsty Apolln Mikoff and other poets of that school his name in
Russian criticism has become a general appellation to designate a poet
of pure art for he was the most typical exponent of his school Most of
his poems are short and present a picture of nature or of some
delicate fleeting psychical emotion but they are all filled with
enchanting artistic charm His poetry is the quintessence of sthetic
voluptuousness such as was evolved on the soil of the sybaritism of the
landed gentry in the circles of the s of the nineteenth century

The oldest of all these worshipers of pure art was Fedor Ivnovitch
Titcheff  At the age of seventeen he made a remarkably fine
translation of some of Horaces works He rose to very fine positions in
the diplomatic service and at court Although his first poems were
printed in  he was not widely known until  His scope is
not large and he is rather wearisome in his faultless poems The
majority of them are rather difficult reading

A poet who did not wholly belong to this school but wrote in many
styles was Ykoff Petrvitch Polnsky  Under different
conditions he might have developed fire and originality both in his
poems and his prose romances His best known poem is The
GrasshopperMusician  He derived his inspiration from various
foreign poets and also from many of his fellowcountrymen Among
others those in the spirit of Koltzffs national ballads are not only
full of poetry and inspiration art and artless simplicity but some of
them have been set to music have made their way to the populace and
are sung all over Russia Others like The Sun and the Moon and The
Babys Death are to be found in every Russian literary compendium and
every child knows them by heart

But while the poetry of this period could not boast of any such great
figures as the preceding period it had nevertheless another camp
besides that of the pure art advocates whom we have just noticed At
the head of the second group which clung to the sthetic doctrine that
regarded everyday life as the best source of inspiration and contained
several very talented expositors stood Nikoli Alexyevitch Nekrsoff
 Nekrsoff belonged to an impoverished noble family which
had once been very wealthy and was still sufficiently well off to have
educated him in comfort But when his father sent him to St Petersburg
to enter a military school he was persuaded to abandon that career and
take a course at the University His father was so enraged at this step
that he cast him off and the lad of sixteen found himself thrown upon
his own resources He nearly starved to death and underwent such
hardships that his health was injured for life but he did not manage to
complete the University course These very hardships contributed
greatly no doubt to the power of his poetry later on even though they
exerted a hardening effect upon his character and aroused in him the
firm resolve to acquire wealth at any cost Successful as his
journalistic enterprises were in later life it is known that he could
not have assured himself the comfortable fortune he enjoyed from that
source alone and he is said to have won most of it at the
gamblingtable This fact and various other circumstances may have
exercised some influence upon the judgment of a section of the public as
to his literary work There is hardly any other Russian writer over
whose merits such heated discussions take place as over Nekrsoff one
party maintaining that he was a true poet with genuine inspiration
the other that he was as clever with his poetry in a business sense as
he was with financial operations and that he possessed no feeling
inspiration or poetry The truth would seem to lie between these
two extremes Like all the other writers of his daylike writers in
generalhe was unconsciously impressed by the spirit of the time and
changed his subjects and treatment as it changed and like every other
writer some of his works are superior in feeling and truth to others

The most important period of his life was that from  to  when
his talent was forming and ripening Little is known with definiteness
regarding this period but it is certain that while pursuing his
literary labors he moved in widely differing circles of
societyfashionable official literary theatrical that of the
students and otherswhich contributed to the truth of his pictures
from these different spheres in his poems In  he was able in
company with Paneff to buy The Contemporary of which eventually
he became the sole proprietor and editor and with which his name is
indelibly connected When this journal was dropped in  he became
the head in  of The Annals of the Fatherland where he remained
until his death It was during these last ten years of his life that he
wrote his famous poems Russian Women and Who in Russia Finds Life
Good with others of his best poems He never lost his adoration of
the critic Byelnsky to whom he attributed his own success as the
result of judicious development of his powers

One of the many conflicting opinions concerning him is that he is
merely a satirist The Russian Juvenal which opinion is founded on
his contributions to The Whistle a publication added as a
supplement to The Contemporary about  Yet his satirical verses
form but an insignificant part of his writings And although there does
exist a certain monotony of gloomy depression in the tone of all his
writings yet they are so varied in form and contents that it is
impossible to classify them under any one heading without resorting to
undue violence He is not the poet of any one class of society of any
one party or circle but expresses in his poetry the thoughts of a whole
cycle of his native land the tears of all his contemporaries and
fellowcountrymen This apparently would be set down to the credit of
any other man and regarded as a proof that he kept in intimate touch
with the spirit and deepest sentiments of his time instead of being
reckoned a reproach and a proof of commercialism Moreover he wrote
things which were entirely peculiar to himself unknown hitherto and
which had nothing in common with the purely reflective lyricism of the
s of the nineteenth century These serve to complete his
significance as the universal bard of his people and his age to which
he is already entitled by his celebration of all ranks and elements of
society whose fermentation constitutes the actual essence of that
period

There is one point to be noted about Nekrsoff which was somewhat
neglected by the critics during his lifetime No other Russian poet of
that day was so fond of calling attention to the bright sides of the
national life or depicted so many positive ideal brilliant types with
such fervent purely Schilleresque enthusiasm as Nekrsoff And most
significant of all his positive types are not of an abstract fantastic
character clothed in flesh and blood of the period and environment
filled with conflicting concrete characteristicsnot one of them
resembles any other He sought and found them in all classes of society
in Russian Women he depicts the devoted princesses in the highest
circle of the social hierarchy with absolute truth as faithful
representatives of Russian life and Russian aristocrats capable of
abandoning their life of ease and pleasure and with heroism worthy of
the ancient classic heroines accompanying their exiled husbands to
Siberia and there cheerfully sharing their hardships His pictures of
peasant life are equally fine that in RedNosed Frost the Russian
equivalent of Jack Frost is particularly famous and the peasant
heroine in her lowly sphere yields nothing in grandeur to the ladies
of the court

The theme of RedNosed Frost may be briefly stated in a couple of its
verses in the original meter

    There are women in Russian hamlets
      With a dignified calmness of face
    With a beautiful strength in their movements
      With mien and glance of an empress in grace

    A blind man alone could ignore them
      And he who can see them must say
    She passestis as though the sun shineth
      She lookstis giving rubles away

A nobleminded splendid peasant woman who has worthily fulfilled all
the duties of her hard lot at last becomes a widow The manner of it
the quaint folkremedies employed to heal the sick man the making of
the shroud by the bereaved wife the digging of his grave by his father
the funeral all are described The widow drives the sledge with the
coffin to the grave On her return home she finds that the fire is out
and that there is no wood on hand Intrusting her two children to the
care of a neighbor she drives off with the sledge to the forest to cut
some As she collects the fuel her thoughts wander back over the past
and she sees a vision of her life its joys and sorrows Just as she is
about to set out for home she pauses approaches a tall pinetree with
her axe and there Jack Frost woos and wins her and she remains frozen
stiff The beauty and interest of the poem quite escape in this
necessarily bald summary The same is the case with Russian Women
The first poem of this is entitled Princess Trubetzky It begins by
narrating how the Countfather prepares the covered traveling sledge
for the Princess who is bent upon the long journey to Siberia to join
her husband one of the Decembrists exiled for participation in the
tumults of  on the accession to the throne of Nicholas I He
spreads a thick bearskin rug puts in downpillows hangs up a holy
image ikna in the corner grieving the while After this prologue
the journey of the devoted wife is described the monotonous way being
spent in great part by the noble woman in visionlike memories of her
happy childhood girlhood and married life On arriving at Irktsk she
receives a visit from the governor an old subordinate of her father
who endeavors by every possible means to deter her from pursuing her
journey She persists in demanding that fresh horses be put to her
sledge and that she be allowed to proceed to the Nertchnsk mines
where her husband is Failing to frighten her by the description of the
hardships she will be compelled to endure by telling her that she will
have to live in the common ward of the prison with hundreds of
prisoners never see her husband alone and the like he at last informs
her that she can proceed only on condition that she renounces all her
rights title property She demands the document on the instant and
signs it and again demands her horses The governor who by pleading
illness has already detained the impatient woman a whole week then
tells her that having renounced her rights she must traverse the
remaining eight hundred versts on foot like a common prisoner and
that the majority fall by the way in so doing Her only thought is the
extra time which this will require The governor having done his duty
tells her that she shall have her horses and sledge as before he will
assume the responsibility She proceeds Here the poem ends But the
second poem entitled Princess Volknsky and dated  carries
the story further for both women It takes the form of a tale told to
her grandchildren to whom says the Princess Volknsky she will
bequeath flowers from her sister Muraviffs grave in Siberia a
collection of butterflies the flora of Tchit views of that savage
country and an iron bracelet forged by their grandfather from his
chains She narrates how at the age of seventeen she married the
Prince a friend of her father and the hero of many campaigns much
older than herself who even after the wedding is absent the greater
part of the time on his military duties Once when they meet again
after one of these prolonged separations he is suddenly seized with
panic burns many documents in her presence and takes her home to her
father without however explaining anything After that she hears
nothing about him for many months no letters reach her every one
professes ignorance as to his whereabouts but assures her he is engaged
in his duties Even when her son is born he makes no sign and all
further efforts to pacify her prove useless She goes to St Petersburg
finds out the truth and insists on joining her husband who with Prince
Trubetzky and the other noble Decembrists is in Siberia Every effort
on the part of friends and relatives to prevent her leaving her baby and
taking this step prove of no avail She obtains the Emperors
permission and sets out The description of her journey is even more
graphic and touching than that of Princess Trubetzkys She hears on
the way about the efforts which have been made to turn the latter from
her purpose and that probably the same measures will be used with her
At one point she meets the caravan which is bringing the silver from the
Nertchnsk mines to the capital and she asks the young officer in
charge if the exiles are alive and well He replies insultingly that he
knows nothing about such people But one of the peasantsoldiers of the
caravan quietly gives her the desired information and she adds that
invariably throughout her long and trying experience the peasant men
have been truly sympathetic helpful and kind to the last degree when
their superiors were not Efforts to turn her aside fail She overtakes
Princess Trubetzky and the two friends pursue their sad journey
together On arriving in Nertchnsk the commandant questions their
right to see their husbands refuses to recognize the Emperors own
signature says he will send to Irktsk for information they had
offered to go back themselves for it and until it is received they
will not be permitted to hold communication with those whom they have
come so far to see The women resign themselves and pass the night in a
peasant hut so small that their heads touch the wall their feet the
door Princess Volknsky waking early sets out on a stroll through the
village and comes to the mouth of the mineshaft guarded by a sentry
She prevails upon this sentry to let her descend contrary to orders
and after a long and arduous passage through the rough dripping
corridors and after running the risk of discovery by an official and
even of death when she extinguishes her torch to escape the official
and proceeds in the dark she reaches her husband and the other
Decembrist exiles and delivers to them the letters from their friends
which she has with her The poem is most beautiful and affecting

A third very famous poem is Who in Russia Finds Life Good Seven
peasants meet by chance on the highway and fall into a dispute on that
theme One says the landed proprietor another the official a
third the priest Others say respectively the fatbellied
merchant the minister of the empire the Tzar All of the peasants
had started out at midday upon important errands but they argue hotly
until sundown walking all the while and do not notice even that until
an old woman happens along and asks them Where are they bound by
night On glancing about them the peasants perceive that they are
thirty versts from home and they are too fatigued to undertake the
return journey at once They throw the blame on the ForestFiend seat
themselves in the woods and light a fire One man goes off to procure
liquor another for food and as they consume these they begin the
discussion all over again in such vehement wise that all the beasts and
birds of the forest are affrighted At last Pakhm one of the peasants
catches a young bird in his hand and says that frail and tiny as it is
it is more mighty than a peasant man because its wings permit it to fly
whithersoever it wishes and he beseeches the birdling to give them its
wings so that they may fly all over the empire and observe and inquire
Who dwelleth happily and at ease in Russia Surely Ivn remarks
wings are not needed if only they could be sure of half a pud eighteen
pounds of bread a day meaning the sour black rye bread they could
measure off Mother Russia with their own legs Another of the peasants
stipulates for a vedr two and threequarters gallons of vdka
another for cucumbers every morning another for a wooden can of kvas
small beer brewed from the rye bread or meal every noon another for
a teapot of boiling tea every evening A peewit circles above them in
the air listening then alights beside their bonfire chirps and
addresses them in human speech She promises that if they will release
her offspring she will give them all they desire The compact is made
she tells them where to go in the forest and dig up a coffer containing
a selfsetting tablecloth which will carry them all over the country
at their behest They demand in addition that they shall be fed and
clothed granted They get the carpet their daily supply of food
appears from its folds on demand they may double but not treble the
allowance and they vow not to return to their families until they
shall have succeeded in their quest of a happy man in Russia Their
first encounter is with a priest who in response to their questions
asks if happiness does not consist in peace wealth and honor He
then describes his life and demonstrates that a priest gets none of
these things As they proceed on their way they meet and interrogate
people from all ranks and classes This affords the poet an opportunity
for a series of pictures from Russian life replete with national
characteristics stories arguments songs described in varying meters
The whole forms a splendid and profoundly interesting national
picturegallery

The movements of the s and the s brought to the front several
poets who sprang directly from the people On the borderland of the two
epochs stands the most renowned of Little Russian poets Tars
Grigrievitch Shevtchnko  He was the contemporary of
Koltzff and Byelnsky rather than of Nekrsoff nevertheless he may
be regarded as a representative of the latters epoch in virtue of the
contents and the spirit of his poetry

His history is both interesting and remarkable He was the son of a
serf in the government of Keff When he was eight years old his mother
died and his father married again His stepmother favored her own
children and to constant quarrels between the two broods incessant
altercation between the parents was added At the age of eleven when
his father died he began a roving life He ran away from a couple of
ecclesiastics who had undertaken to teach him to read and write after
having acquired the rudiments of those arts and made numerous
ineffectual attempts to obtain instruction in painting from various
wretched daubers of holy pictures having been addicted from his
earliest childhood to scrawling over the walls of the house and the
fences with charcoal drawings He was obliged to turn shepherd In 
he was taken on as one of his masters household servants and sent to
Vlna where at first he served as scullion Later on it was decided
that he was fitted to become the household painter

But he served at first as personal attendant on his master and handed
him a light for his pipe until his master caught him one night drawing
a likeness of Kazk Pltoff whereupon he pulled Shevtchnkos ears
cuffed him ordered him to be flogged but simultaneously acquired the
conviction that the lad might be converted into a painter to the
establishment So Shevtchnko began to study under a Vlna artist and a
year and a half later by the advice of his teacher who recognized his
talent the master sent the lad to a portraitpainter in Warsaw In 
he was sent to his master in St Petersburg on foot by the regular
police stages tape arriving almost shoeless and acted as lackey
in the establishment At last his master granted his urgent request and
apprenticed him for four years to an instructor in painting Here
Shevtchnko made acquaintance with the artist I M Sshenko and
through him with an author of some little note who took pity on the
young fellows sorry plight and began to invite him to his house give
him books to read furnish him with various useful suggestions and with
money Thus did Shevtchnko come to know the Russian and western
classical authors history and so forth Through Sshenkos agency the
aid of the secretary of the Academy of Arts was invoked to rescue the
young man from his artist masters intolerable oppression and his
literary friend introduced Shevtchnko to Zhukvsky who took an ardent
interest in the fate of the talented young fellow They speedily began
operations to free Shevtchnko from serfdom and the manner in which it
was finally affected is curious A certain general ordered a portrait of
himself from Shevtchnko for which he was to pay fifty rubles The
general was not pleased with the portrait and refused to accept it The
offended artist painted the generals beard over with a froth of
shavingsoap and sold the picture for a song to the barber who was in
the habit of shaving the general and he used it as a sign The general
flew into a rage immediately purchased the portrait and with a view to
revenging himself on the artist he offered the latters master a huge
sum for him Shevtchnko was so panicstricken at the prospect of what
awaited him that he fled for aid to the artist Briulff entreating the
latter to save him Briulff told Zhukvsky and Zhukvsky repeated the
story to the Empress Alexndra Fedorovna wife of Nicholas I
Shevtchnkos master was ordered to stop the sale The Empress then
commanded Briulff to complete a portrait of her which he had begun and
she put it up as the prize in a lottery among the members of the
imperial family for the sum of ten thousand rublesthe price offered
for Shevtchnko by the enraged general Shevtchnko thus received his
freedom in May  and immediately began to attend the classes in the
Academy of Arts and speedily became one of Briulffs favorite pupils
and comrades

In  he published his Kobzr which made an impression in
Little Russia In  he began the publication of his famous poem The
Hadamk A Warrior of Ancient Ukrana In  he was arrested and
sent back to Little Russia where he lived until  and during this
period his talent bore its fairest blossoms and his best works
appeared The Banquet of the Dead The Hired Woman The Dream
The Prisoner Ivn Gus the goose The Cold Hillside and so
forth His literary fame reached its zenith and brought with it the
friendship of the best intellectual forces of southern Russia and with
the aid of Princess Rypnin cousin to the minister of public education
and Count Uvroff he obtained the post of drawingmaster in Keff
University But in  some one overheard and distorted a conversation
in which Shevtchnko and several friends had taken part the result
being that all were arrested while Shevtchnko after being taken to
St Petersburg was sent to the Orenburg government in the far
southeast to serve as a common soldier in the ranks and was forbidden
to paint or to write There he remained for ten years when he returned
to the capital and settled down at the Academy of Arts where he was
granted a studio in accordance with his right as an academician He
never produced anything of note in the literary line thereafter and the
last three years of his life were chiefly devoted to releasing his
relatives from serfdom and furnishing them with land for cottages
which object he accomplished a few months before the general
emancipation of the serfs

In the work of Shevtchnko it is possible to follow the curious
transformation from what may be called the collectivefolk creative
power to the purely individual His figures subjects and the quiet
heartrending sadness of his poems are precisely the same as those to
be met with in any Little Russian folkballad The majority of his poems
are not inventions but are taken directly from popular legends and
traditions and the personality of the poet vanishes in a flood of
purely popular poetry Nevertheless he is not a slavish copyist of this
folkpoetry The language of his compositions is strikingly simple and
comprehensible not only to nativeborn Little Russians but also to
those who are not acquainted with the dialect of that region Most
writers who have employed the Little Russian dialect are difficult of
comprehension not only to educated Great Russians but also to ordinary
Little Russians because their language is artificial intermingled with
a mass of new words and expressions invented in educated circles of
Little Russia But Shevtchnko wrote in the living tongue of the
Ukrana in which its people talk and sing His best work after he came
under the influence of Zhukvsky is The Hired Woman This is the
story of a girl who is betrayed then forced by outsiders to abandon her
child after which she hires herself out as servant to the people at
whose door she has left the child and so is enabled to rear it only
revealing the secret to her child on her deathbed

The sufferings of the people in serfdom form the subject of another
series of his poems and in this category Katerna is the best worked
out and most dramatic of his productions A third category comprises the
historical ballads in which he celebrates the days of kazk freedom
This class comprises two long poems The Hadamk The Kazk Warrior
of Ancient Ukrana and Gamliya besides a number of short
rhapsodies In these poems the writer has expressed his political and
social views and they are particularly prized by his fellowlandsmen of
the Ukrana The fourth or in the order of their appearance the
first class of Shevtchnkos poems consists of ballads in the
folkstyle and sentimental romantic pieces which have no political or
social tendencies Such are the ballads The Cause The Drowned
Woman The Water Nymph The Poplar Tree which he wrote in St
Petersburg on scraps of paper in the summer garden

Of less talent and importance was a fellowcitizen of Koltzff Ivn
Svitch Niktin  Perhaps the most interesting thing about
him is that Count L N Tolsty took a lively interest in this gifted
plebeian and offered to bear the cost of publishing his poems
regarding him as a new Koltzff Count Tolsty has since arrived at the
conclusion that all poetry is futile and an unnecessary waste of time
as the same ideas can be much better expressed in prose and with less
labor to both writer and reader

The poet from the educated classes of society who deserves the most
attention as a member of Nekrsoffs camp is Alexyi Nikolevitch
Pleshtcheff  the descendant of an ancient family of the
nobility In  he was arrested for suspected implication in what is
known as The Petrashvsky Affair from the name of the leader and
imprisoned in the PeterPaul Fortress Together with Dostovsky and
nineteen others he was condemned to be shot but all the prisoners were
pardoned by the Emperor the charge was high treason at the last
moment and after spending nine months in the fortress Pleshtcheff was
sent to serve as a common soldier in the troops of the line in the
Orenburg government with the loss of all his civil rights There he
remained nine years taking part in several border campaigns and rising
to the rank of ensign after which he entered the civil service In 
he was allowed to return to Moscow whence he removed to St Petersburg
in 

The principal writers of satirical verse during this period were
Alexyi Mikhilovitch Zhemtchzhnikoff  V S Krotchkin
 who founded the extremely popular journal The Spark in
 and D D Mineff

FOOTNOTES

 I had the pleasure of knowing Polnsky and his wife a gifted
sculptress He was a great favorite in society for his charming
personality as well as for his poetry He served on the Committee of
Foreign Censure

 I permit myself to quote from my Russian Rambles Count L N
Tolstys opinion in which he succinctly expressed to me the view of
this second party There are three requisites which go to make a
perfect writer First he must have something worth saying Second he
must have a proper way of saying it Third he must have sincerity
Dickens had all three of these qualities Thackeray had not much to say
he had a great deal of art in saying it but he had not enough
sincerity Dostovsky possessed all three requisites Nekrsoff knew
well how to express himself but he did not possess the first quality
he forced himself to say somethingwhatever would catch the public at
the moment of which he was a very keen judge as he wrote to suit the
popular taste believing not at all in what he said He had none of the
third requisite

CHAPTER XI

DOSTOVSKY


All the writers of the s of the nineteenth century had their
individual peculiarities But in this respect Fedor Mikhilovitch
Dostovsky  was even more sharply separated from all the rest
by his characteristics which almost removed him from the ranks of the
writers of the epoch and gave him a special place in literature

The chief cause of this distinction lies in the fact that while most of
the other writers sprang from the country regions being members of the
landed gentry class Dostovsky represents the plebeian toiling class
of society a nervously choleric son of the town and in the second
place while the majority of them were welltodo Dostovsky alone in
the company belonged to the class of educated strugglers with poverty
which had recently made its reappearance

His father was staff physician in the Mrya Hospital in Moscow and he
was the second son in a family of seven children The whole family lived
in two rooms an anteroom and kitchen which comprised the quarters
allotted to the post by the government Here strictly religious and
patriarchal customs reigned mitigated by the high cultivation of the
head of the family

In  Fedor Mikhilovitch and his elder brother were taken to St
Petersburg by their father to be placed in the School for Engineers
but the elder did not succeed in entering on account of feeble health
Dostovsky had already evinced an inclination for literature and
naturally he was not very diligent in his studies of the dry applied
sciences taught in the school But he found time to make acquaintance
with the best works of Russian English French and German classical
authors In  he completed his course and was appointed to actual
service in the draughting department of the St Petersburg engineer
corps

With his salary and the money sent to him by his guardian his father
being dead he had about five thousand rubles a year but as he was
extremely improvident bohemian and luxurious in his tastes he could
never make both ends meet He was still more straitened in his finances
when in  he resigned from the service which was repugnant to him
and utterly at variance with his literary proclivities and was obliged
to resort to making translations In May  he completed his first
romance Poor People and sent it to Nekrsoff by his schoolfriend
Grigorvitch In his Diary Dostovsky has narrated the manner of its
reception by Nekrsoff who was preparing to publish a collection and
by Byelnsky to whom the latter gave it Grigorvitch and Nekrsoff sat
up all night to read it so fascinated were they and then hastened
straight to communicate their rapture to the author Nekrsoff then gave
the manuscript to Byelnsky with the exclamation A new Ggol has made
his appearance to which Byelnsky sternly replied Ggols spring up
like mushrooms with you But when he had read the romance he cried
out with emotion Bring him bring him to me

Even before the romance made its appearance in print early in 
Dostovsky had won a flattering literary reputation The young authors
head was fairly turned with his swift success and he grew arrogant the
result of which was that he soon quarreled with Byelnsky Nekrsoff
and their whole circle and published his later writings with one
exception elsewhere than in The Contemporary His coolness towards
the circle of The Contemporary was not a little aided by the
difference in opinions which began to make themselves felt Dostovsky
was carried away by the political and social ideas which reigned in that
circle but at the same time he obstinately upheld his own religious
views The result of this was that the members of the circle began to
regard him as behind the times He became more and more interested in
socialism and soon went to live with his new friends in quarters where
the principles of association ruled He then entered the Droff circle
of Fourierists the most moderate of all the Petrashvsky circles which
a good authority declares to have entertained no purely revolutionary
ideas whatever They rebelled against the maintenance of the strict
censorship then in force serfdom and administrative abuses but paid
little attention to the question of a change in the form of government
and attributed no importance to political upheavals Dostovsky himself
was in general very far from cherishing any revolutionary designs he
enthusiastically declaimed Pshkins verses about slavery falling at
the wave of the Tzars hand and insisted that no socialistic theories
had the slightest importance for Russians since in the commune and the
working unions artl and mutual guarantee system there had long
existed in their land more solid and normal foundations than all the
dreams of Saint Simon and his school and that life in a community and
phalanstery seemed to him more terrible and repulsive than that of any
galleyslave

Notwithstanding this in May  Dostovsky was arrested along with
the other followers of Petrashvsky confined in the fortress and
condemned by courtmartial on the charge of having taken part in
discussions concerning the severity of the censorship and in one
assembly in March  had read a letter from Byelnsky to Ggol
received from Pleshtcheff in Moscow and had then read it aloud in the
assemblies at Droffs and had given copies of it to Mombelli to copy
In the assemblies at Droffs he had listened to the reading of
articles knew of the intention to set up a printingpress and at
Spyshneffs had listened to the reading of A Soldiers Conversation

All the Petrashvskyians were condemned to be shot and the sentence was
read to them on January   on the scaffold where they stood
stripped in the freezing cold for twenty minutes in momentary
expectation of their execution But the death sentence was mitigated in
different degrees by the Emperor Dostovskys sentence being commuted
to exile with hard labor for four years and then service as a common
soldier in the ranks He was dispatched to Siberia two days later which
was on Christmas Eve according to the Russian reckoning

The wives of the Decembrists the men exiled for revolutionary plots in
 at the accession to the throne of the Emperor Nicholas I
visited the Petrashvskyians in prison at Toblsk and gave Dostovsky a
copy of the Gospels No other book made its way within the prison walls
and after reading nothing else for the next three years Dostovsky
according to his own words forced by necessity to read the Bible only
was enabled more clearly and profoundly to grasp the meaning of
Christianity In his Notes from a Dead House he has described in
detail his life in the prison at Omsk and all his impressions Prison
life produced an extremely crushing and unfavorable impression on him
He was brought into close contact with the common people was enabled to
study them but he also became thoroughly imbued with that spirit of
mysticism which is peculiar to ignorant and illiterate people His own
view of the universe was that of childlike faith and prison life
strengthened this view by leading him to see in it the foundation of the
national spirit and the national life During the last year of his
prison life under a milder commandant he was able to renew his
relations with former schoolmates and friends in the town and through
them obtain more money write home and even come into possession of
books

But his health was much affected his nerves having been weak from
childhood and already so shattered that in  he was on the verge
of insanity Even at that time he had begun to have attacks by night of
that mystical terror which he has described in detail in Humiliated
and Insulted and he also had occasional epileptic fits In Siberia
epilepsy developed to such a point that it was no longer possible to
entertain any doubt as to the character of his malady

On leaving prison in  and becoming a soldier Dostovsky was much
better off He was soon promoted to the rank of ensign wrote a little
planned Notes from a Dead House and in  married At last after
prolonged efforts he received permission to return to European Russia
in July  and settled in Tver In the winter of that year his
rights among them that of living in the capital were restored to him
and in  he and his elder brother began to publish a journal called
The Times The first number contained the first installment of
Humiliated and Insulted and simultaneously during  Notes
from a Dead House appeared there also in addition to critical literary
articles from his pen This and other editorial and journalistic
ventures met with varying success and he suffered many reverses of
fortune In  he wrote his masterpiece Crime and Punishment
His first wife having died he married his stenographer in  and
traveled in western Europe for the next four years in the course of
which he wrote his romances The Idiot  The Eternal Husband
 and Devils  After his return to Russia he wrote
 The Stripling and  began the publication of The Diary
of a Writer which was in the nature of a monthly journal made up of
his own articles chiefly of a political character and bearing on the
SerboTurkish War But it also contained literary and autobiographical
articles and had an enormous success despite the irregularity of its
appearance

In June  he delivered a speech before the Society of Lovers of
Russian Literature which won him such popularity as he had never before
enjoyed and resulted in a tremendous ovation on the part of the
public at the unveiling of the monument to Pshkin He was besieged
with letters and visits people came to him incessantly from all parts
of St Petersburg and of Russia with expressions of admiration
requests for aid questions complaints against others and expressions
of opinions hostile to him personally In the last half of  he
finished The Karamzoff Brothers His funeral on February  
was very remarkable the occasion of an unprecedented manifestation
which those who took part in it are still proud of recalling Fortytwo
deputations bearing wreaths and an innumerable mass of people walked
miles after his coffin to the cemetery of the Alexander Nvsky
Monastery

Under the various influences to which Dostovsky was subjected he
eventually became what is known in Russia as a nativesoiler in
literaturethe leader in fact of that semiSlavynophil semiWestern
schooland towards the end of his life was converted into a genuine
Slavophil and mystic In this conversion as well as in the mystical
theories which he preached in his Diary and afterwards in his
romances beginning with Crime and Punishment Dostovsky has
something in common with Count L N Tolsty Both writers were
disenchanted as to European progress admitted the mental and moral
insolvency of educated Russian society and fell into despair from
which the only escape so it seemed to them was becoming imbued with
the lively faith of the common people and both authors regarded this
faith as the sole means of getting into real communion with the people
Then becoming more and more imbued with the spirit of the Christian
doctrine both arrived at utter rejection of material improvement of the
general welfare Count Tolsty came out with a theory of nonresistance
to evil by force and Dostovsky with a theory of moral elevation and
purification by means of suffering which in essence are identical for
in what manner does nonresistance to evil manifest itself if not in
unmurmuring endurance of the sufferings caused by evil

Nevertheless a profound difference exists between Count Tolsty and
Dostovsky In the former we see an absence of conservatism and devotion
to tradition His attitude towards all doctrines is that of
unconditional freedom of thought and subjecting them to daring
criticism he chooses from among them only that which is in harmony with
the inspirations of his own reason He is a genuine individualist to
his very marrow By the masses of the common people he does not mean
the Russian nation only but all the toilers and producers of the earth
without regard to nationality while by the faith which he seeks among
those toilers he does not mean any fixed religious belief but faith in
the reasonableness and advantageousness of life and of everything which
exists placing this faith in dependence upon brisk healthy toil

Dostovsky on the contrary is a communist or socialist He cares
nothing for freedom and the selfperfection of the individual The
individual according to his teaching should merely submit and
resignedly offer itself up as a sacrifice to society for the sake of
fulfilling that mission which Russia is foreordained as Gods chosen
nation to accomplish This mission consists in the realization upon
earth of true Christianity in orthodoxy to which the Russian people
remain faithful and devoted union with the common people is to be
accomplished in that manner alone like the common people with the same
boundless faith and devotion orthodoxy must be professed for in it
alone lies all salvation not only for the world as a whole but for
every individual

The character of Dostovskys works is determined by the fact that he
was a child of the town In their form they possess none of that elegant
regularity of that classical finish and clearcut outline which
impress us in the works of Turgneff and Gontcharff On the contrary
they surprise us by their awkwardness their prolixity their lack of
severe finish which requires abundant leisure It is evident that they
were written in haste by a man who was eternally in want embarrassed
with debts and incapable of making the two ends meet financially At
the same time one is struck by the entire absence in Dostovskys works
of those artistic elements in which the works of the other authors of
the s are rich They contain no enchanting pictures of nature no
soulstirring love scenes meetings kisses the bewitching feminine
types which turn the readers head for which Turgneff and Tolsty are
famous Dostovsky even ridicules Turgneff for his feminine portraits
in Devils under the character of the writer Karmaznoff with his
passion for depicting kisses not as they take place with all mankind
but with gorse or some such weed growing round about which one must
look up in a botany while the sky must not fail to be of a purplish
hue which of course no mortal ever beheld and the tree under which
the interesting pair is seated must infallibly be orangecolored and so
forth

Dostovskys subjects also present a sharp difference from those of his
contemporaries whose subjects are characterized by extreme simplicity
and absence of complication only a few actors being brought on the
stagenot more than two three or fourand the entire plot being as
a rule confined to the rivalry of two lovers and to the question upon
which of them the heroine will bestow her love It is quite the contrary
with Dostovsky His plots are complicated and entangled he introduces
a throng of acting personages In reading his romances one seems to
hear the roar of the crowd and the life of a town is unrolled before
one with all its bustle its incessantly complicated and unexpected
encounters and relations of people one to another Like a true child of
the town Dostovsky does not confine himself to fashionable
drawingrooms or to the educated classes he is fond of introducing the
reader to the dens of poverty and vice which he invests also with
their own peculiar gloomy poetry In his pictures of low life he more
resembles Dickens than the followers of Georges Sand of his day

But the most essential quality of Dostovskys creative art is the
psychical analysis which occupies the foreground in the majority of his
romances and constitutes their chief power and value A wellknown
alienist doctor who has examined these romances from a scientific point
of view declares himself amazed by the scientific accuracy wherewith
Dostovsky has depicted the mentally afflicted In his opinion about
onefourth of this authors characters are more or less afflicted in
this manner some romances containing as many as three who are not
normal in one way or another This doctor demonstrates that Dostovsky
was a great psychopathologist and that with his artistic insight he
anticipated even exact science And much that he has written will
certainly be incorporated in psychological textbooks It is
superfluous after such competent testimony to insist upon the
lifelikeness and the truth to nature of his portraits The effect of
his books on a reader is overwhelming even stunning and
nerveshattering

One further point is to be noted that notwithstanding the immense
number of characters presented to the reader by Dostovsky they all
belong to a very limited number of types which are repeated with
slight variations in all his romances Thus in conformity with the
doctrine of the nativesoilers he places at the foundation of the
majority of his works one of the two following types  The gentle
type of the man overflowing with tender affection of utter
selfsacrifice ready to forgive everything to justify everything to
bear himself compassionately towards the treachery of the girl he loves
and to go on loving her even to the point of removing the obstacles to
her marriage with another man and so forth Such is the hero of Crime
and Punishment such is Prince Mshkinh in The Idiot and so on 
The rapacious type the type of the egoist brimming over with passion
knowing no bounds to his desires and restrained by no laws either
human or divine Such are Stavrgin in Devils Dmtry Karamzoff
The Karamzoff Brothers and so forth His women also can be divided
into two similar contrasting types on the one hand the gentlethe
type of the woman who possesses a heart which is tender and loving to
selfabnegation like Nelly and Natsha in Humiliated and Insulted
Rasklnikoffs mother and Snya in Crime and Punishment Ntotchka
Nezvnoff in The Stripling On the other hand there are the
rapacious types of capricious charming women who are tyrannical to the
point of cruelty like Polna in The Gambler Nastsya Filppovna in
The Idiot Grshenka and Katerna Ivnovna in The Karamzoff
Brothers and Varvra Petrvna in Devils

The reactionary tendency made its appearance in Dostovsky almost
contemporaneously with its appearance in Turgneff and Gontcharff
unhappily The first romance in which it presented itself was Crime and
Punishment the masterpiece in which his talent attained its zenith
This work in virtue of its psychical and psychological analyses
deserves to rank among the greatest and best monuments of European
literary art in the nineteenth century Unfortunately it produced a
strange impression on all reasonable people because of the fact that
the author suddenly makes the crime of his hero Rasklnikoff dependent
upon the influence of new ideas as though they justified crimes
committed with good objects No less surprising is the manner in which
the romance winds up with the moral regeneration of Rasklnikoff under
the influence of exile with hard labor

Dostovsky to be fully appreciated requiresperhaps more than most
writersto be read at length But the following brief extract will
afford a glimpse of his manner The extract is from the Notes from a
Dead House Sushloff was a prisoner who had been sent to Siberia
merely for colonization for some trifling breach of the laws During a
fit of intoxication he had been persuaded by a prisoner named Mikhiloff
to exchange names and punishments in consideration of a new red shirt
and one ruble in cash Such exchanges were by no means rare but the
prisoner to whose disadvantage the bargain redounded generally demanded
scores of rubles hence every one ridiculed Sushloff for the cheap
rate at which he had sold his light sentence Had he been able to
return the ruble which he had immediately spent for liquor he might
have bought back his name but the prisoners artl or guild always
insisted upon the strict fulfilment of such bargains in default of the
money being refunded and if the authorities suspected such exchanges
they did not pry into them it being immaterial to the officials in
Siberia at least what man served out the sentence so long as they
could make their accounts tally Thus much in explanation abbreviated
from Dostovskys statement

     Sushloff and I lived a long time together several years in
     all He gradually became greatly attached to me I could not
     help perceiving this as I had also become thoroughly used to
     him But one dayI shall never forgive myself for ithe did
     not comply with some request of mine although he had just
     received money from me and I had the cruelty to say to him
     Here you are taking my money Sushloff but you dont do your
     duty Sushloff made no reply but seemed suddenly to grow
     melancholy Two days elapsed I said to myself it cannot be
     the result of my words I knew that a certain prisoner Antn
     Vaslieff was urgently dunning him for a petty debt He
     certainly had no money and was afraid to ask me for any So on
     the third day I said to him Sushloff I think you have
     wanted to ask me for money to pay Antn Vaslieff Here it is
     I was sitting on the sleepingshelf at the time Sushloff was
     standing in front of me He seemed very much surprised that I
     should offer him the money of my own accord that I should
     voluntarily remember his difficult situation the more so as
     in his opinion he had already and that recently taken
     altogether too much from me in advance so that he dared not
     hope that I would give him any more He looked at the money
     then at me abruptly turned away and left the room All this
     greatly amazed me I followed him and found him behind the
     barracks He was standing by the prison stockade with his face
     to the fence his head leaning against it and propping himself
     against it with his arm Sushloff whats the matter with
     you I asked him He did not look at me and to my extreme
     surprise I observed that he was on the verge of weeping You
     thinkAlexnder Petrvitch he began in a broken voice
     as he endeavored to look another way that I serve youfor
     moneybut IIeeekh Here he turned again to the fence
     so that he even banged his brow against itand how he did
     begin to sob It was the first time I had beheld a man weep in
     the prison With difficulty I comforted him and although from
     that day forth he began to serve me more zealously than ever
     if that were possible and to watch over me yet I perceived
     from almost imperceptible signs that his heart could never
     pardon me for my reproach and yet the others laughed at us
     persecuted him at every convenient opportunity sometimes
     cursed him violentlybut he lived in concord and friendship
     with them and never took offense Yes it is sometimes very
     difficult to know a man thoroughly even after long years of
     acquaintance

Dostovsky in all his important novels has much to say about religion
and his personages all illustrate some phase of religious life This is
nowhere more apparent than in his last novel The Karamzoff Brothers
wherein the religious note is more powerfully struck than in any of the
others The ideal of the Orthodox Church of the East is embodied in
Father Zosm and in his gentle disciple Alexyi Alysha Karamzoff
the reconciling power of redemption is again set forth over the guilty
soul of the principal hero Dmtry Karamzoff when he is overtaken by
chastisement for a suspected crime The doubting element is represented
by Ivn Karamzoff who is tortured by a constant conflict with anxious
questions In The Legend of the Grand Inquisitor which the author
puts into Ivns mouth Dostovskys famous and characteristic power of
analysis reached its greatest height

Belonging to no class and famous for but one book which does not even
count as literature yet chronologically a member of this period was
Nikoli Gavrlovitch Tchernyshvsky  After  he exerted
an immense influence on the minds of young people of both sexes and of
all the writers of the storm and stress period he is the most
interesting because in his renowned book What Is to Be Done he
applied his theories to practical life His success was due not to the
practicability of his theories to his literary qualities to his art
but to the fact that he contrived to unite two things each one of
which as a rule is found in a writer he simultaneously touched the
two most responsive chords in the human heartthe thirst for easy
happiness and the imperative necessity for ascetic selfsacrifice
Hence he won a response from the most diametrically conflicting
natures

What Is to Be Done is the story of a young girl who with the greatest
improbability is represented as being of the purest most lofty
character and sentiments yet the daughter of two phenomenally almost
impossibly degraded people Instead of marrying the rich and not
otherwise undesirable man whom her parents urge on her and who is
deeply in love with her she runs away with her teacher and stipulates
in advance for life in three rooms She is only seventeen yet she
promptly establishes a fashionshop which thrives apace and puts forth
numerous branches all over the capital Her workinggirls are treated
ideally and as equals she working with them in which lies the answer
to What Is to Be Done After a while she falls in love with her
husbands dearest friend who is described as so exactly like him that
the reader is puzzled to know wherein she descried favorable
difference and the husband perceiving this makes things easy by
pretending to drown himself but in reality going off to America
Several years later he returnsas an Americanand his exwifes
present husband having become a medical celebrity helps him to a bride
by informing her panicstricken parents who oppose the match although
they are ignorant at first of any legal impediment to the union that
she will certainly die if they do not yield The two newly assorted
couples live in peace happiness and prosperity ever after Work and
community life are the chief themes of the preachment He was exiled to
Siberia in  and on his return to Russia when he settled in
strakhan and was permitted to resume his literary labors he busied
himself with translations critical articles and the like but was
unable to regain his former place in literature

CHAPTER XII

SEVENTH PERIOD DANILVSKY SALTYKFF L N TOLSTY GRKY AND OTHERS


Under the influence of the romantic movement in western Europe in the
s of the nineteenth century and in particular under the deep
impression made by Sir Walter Scotts novels historical novels and
historical studies began to make their appearance in Russia and in the
s underwent two periods of existence which totally differed from
each other

During the first period the romancewriters including even Pshkin
treated things from a governmental point of view and dealt only with
such epochs all more or less remote as the censorship permitted For
example Zagskin the best known of the historical novelists wrote
skolds Grave from the epoch of the baptism of the Russians in the
tenth century and Yry Miloslvsky from the epoch of the Pretender
early in the seventeenth century while Lazhtchnikoff wrote The
Mussulman from the reign of Ivn III sixteenth century and The
Last Court Page from the epoch of Peter the Greats wars with Sweden
The historical facts were alluded to in a slight passing way or
narrated after the fashion of Karamzn in lofty terms with artificial
patriotic inspiration As the authors lacked archological learning the
manners and accessories of the past were merely sketched in a general
indefinite way and often inaccurately while the pages were chiefly
filled with the sentimental lovepassages of two or three virtuous
heroes of stereotyped patterns who were subjected to frightful
adventures perished several times and were resuscitated for the
purpose of marrying in ordinary fashion at the end

In the s people became far too much interested in the present to pay
much heed to the past Yet precisely at that time the two finest
historians came to the front Sergyi M Soloviff and N I
Kostomroff and effected a complete revolution in historiography
Soloviffs great history brings the narrative down to the reign of
Katherine II Kostomroff dealt with periods giving a complete picture
of each one hence each study while complete in itself does not of
necessity always contain the whole career of the personages who figure
in it But both writers are essentially despite Kostomroffs not very
successful attempts at historical novels serious historians

As we have already seen the novels of the two Counts Tolsty War and
Peace and Prince Serbryany stand quite apart and far above all
others

But among the favorites of lesser rank are Grigry Petrvitch Danilvsky
born in  whose best historical novel is Mirvitch though it
takes unwarrantable liberties with the personages of the epoch depicted
that of Katherine II and those in the adjacent periods Less good
though popular is his Princess Taraknoff the history of a supposed
daughter of the Empress Elizabeth

Halfway between the historians and the portrayers of popular life and
in a measure belonging to both ranks are several talented men The most
famous of them was Pvel Ivnovitch Mlnikoff  whose
official duties enabled him to make an exhaustive study of the Old
Ritualists along the middle Volga

His two novels In the Forests and On the Hills of the eastern and
western banks of the Volga respectively are utterly unlike anything
else in the language and are immensely popular with Russians They are
history in that they faithfully reproduce the manners and beliefs of a
whole class of the population they are genre studies of a very
valuable ethnographical character in their fidelity to nature Long as
they are the interest never flags for a moment but it is not likely
that they will ever appear in an English translation Too extensive and
intimate a knowledge of national ways and beliefs both of the State
Church and the schismatics are required to allow of their being popular
with the majority of foreigners who read Russian for the nonRussian
reading foreigner an excessive amount of explanatory notes would be
required and they would resemble treatises But they are two of the
most delightful books of the epoch and classics in their way Mlnikoff
wrote for a long time under the pseudonym of Andri Petchrsky

Nikoli Semnovitch Lyeskff  who long wrote under the
pseudonym of M Stebntzky is another author famous for his portraits
of a whole class of the population his specialty being the priestly
class He was of noble birth and was reared in luxury but was orphaned
and ruined at a very early age so that he was obliged to earn a hard
living first in government service then as traveler for a private
firm This extensive traveling afforded him the opportunity of making
acquaintance with the life of all classes of the population He began
to write in  but a few incautious words in  raised a storm
against him in the liberal press which accused him of instigating the
police to their attacks upon young people As Count Tolsty remarked to
me this incident prevented Lyeskff ever receiving the full meed of
recognition which his talent merited a large and influential section of
the press was permanently in league against him This eventually so
exasperated and embittered Lyeskff that he really did go over to the
conservative camp and the first result of his wrath was the romance No
Thoroughfare published in  Its chief characters are two ideal
socialists a man and a woman recognized by contemporaries as the
portraits of living persons Both are represented as finding socalled
socialists to be merely crafty nihilists This raised another storm and
still further embittered Lyeskff who expressed himself in To the
Knife in the middle of the s a mad production wherein
revolutionists or nihilists as they were then generally called were
represented as condensed incarnations of the seven deadly sins These
works had much to do with preventing Lyeskff from taking that high
place in the public estimation which his other works a mass of novels
and tales devoid of political tendency and his great talent would have
otherwise assured to him Of his large works The Cathedral Staff
with its sympathetic and lifelike portraits of Archpriest Savly
Tubersoff and his athletic Deacon Achilles and his Episcopal Trifles
rank first The latter volume which consists of a series of pictures
setting forth the dark sides of life in the highest ecclesiastical
hierarchy created a great sensation in the early s and raised a
third storm and the author fell into disfavor in official circles
Perhaps the most perfect of his works is one of the shorter novels The
Sealed Angel which deals with the ways and beliefs of the Old
Ritualists though in the vicinity of Keff not in Mlnikoffs
province and is regarded as a classic besides being a pure delight to
the initiated reader Count L N Tolsty greatly admired he told me
Lyeskffs At the End of the World a tale of missionary effort in
Siberia which is equally delightful in its way though less great
Towards the end of his career Lyeskff was inclined to mysticism and
began to work over ancient religious legends or to invent new ones in
the same style

The direct and immediate result of the democratic tendency on Russian
thought and attraction to the common people during this era was the
creation of a school of writers who devoted themselves almost
exclusively to that sphere in addition to the contributions from
Turgneff Tolsty Dostovsky Among these was a wellknown woman
writer Mrya Alexndrovna Markvitch who published her first Little
Russian Tales in  under the name of Mrko Vovtchk She
immediately translated them into Russian and they were printed in
the best journals of the day I S Turgneff translated one volume
into Russian for her Little Russian language was not of the supreme
quality that characterized Shevtchnkos which needed no translating
and Dobroliboff an authoritative critic of that period expressed
himself in the most flattering manner about them But her fame withered
away as quickly as it had sprung up The weak points of her tales had
been pardoned because of their political contents in ten years they
had lost their charm and their defectsa too superficial knowledge
of the peoples life the absence of living authentic coloring in
portraiture its restriction to general stereotyped types such as
might have been borrowed from popular tales and ballads and excess
of sentimentalitybecame too apparent to be overlooked by a more
enlightened public

The only other woman writer of this period who acquired much reputation
may be mentioned here although she cannot be classed strictly with
portrayers of the people Nadzhda Dmtrievna Khvshtchinsky whose
married name was Zaintchkovsky and who wrote under the pseudonym of
V Krestvsky  She published a great many short stories of
provincial town life rather narrow as to their sphere of observation
Her best work was The Great Bear referring to the constellation
which appeared in 

When literature entered upon a fresh phase of development in the s
of the last century the careful study of the people two men headed the
movement Glyeb Ivnovitch Uspnsky and Nikoli Nikolevitch
Zlatovrtsky Uspnsky  took the negative and pessimistic view
Zlatovrtsky  took the positive optimistic view

Like many authors of that period adverse conditions hindered Uspnskys
march to fame Shortly after his first work The Manners of Rasteryeff
Street began to appear in The Contemporary that journal was
stopped He continued it in another journal which also was stopped
before his work was finished and that after he had been forced to cut
out everything which gave a hint at its being a continuation so that
it might appear to be an independent whole He was obliged to publish
the mangled remains in The Womans News because there was hardly any
other journal then left running After the Servian War generally called
abroad the RussoTurkish War of  Uspnsky abandoned the
plebeian classes to descend to the original source of everythingthe
peasant When he published the disenchanting result of his observations
showing to what lengths a peasant will go for money there was a
sensation This was augmented by his sketch Hard Labor and a still
greater sensation ensued on the publication of his Tis Not a Matter of
Habit known in book form as The Eccentric Master In Hard Labor
he set forth contrary to all theoretical beliefs that the peasants of
villages which had belonged to private landed proprietors prior to the
emancipation were incomparably and incontestably more industrious and
moral than the peasants on the crown estates who had always been
practically free men

Readers were still more alarmed by the deductions set forth in his An
Eccentric Master The hero is an educated man Mikhil Mikhilovitch
who betakes himself to the rural wilds with the express object of
toiling there exactly like the rest as an equal in morals and duties
to sleep with the rest on the straw to eat from one pot with them the
Tolstyan theory but in advance of him while the money acquired thus
by general toil was to be the property of a group of people to be
formed from peasants and from actually ruined former members of the
upper classes But the peasants not comprehending the masters lofty
aims treated him as an eccentric fool and began to rob him in all
directions meanwhile humoring him to the top of his bent in all his
instincts of master It ends in Mikhil Mikhilovitch becoming
thoroughly disillusioned dejected and taking to drink after having
expended the whole of his capital on the ungrateful peasants This will
serve to illustrate Uspnskys pessimistic point of view for which he
certainly had solid grounds

While Uspnsky never sought artistic effects in his work and his chief
strength lay in humor in ridicule which pitilessly destroyed all
illusions Zlatovrtsky never indulges in a smile and is always
whether grieving or rejoicing in a somewhat exalted frame of mind
which often attains the pitch of epic pathos so that even his style
assumes a rather poetical turn something in the manner of hexameters
Moreover he is far from despising the artistic element He established
his fame in  by his first large work Peasant Jurors

As Zlatovrtsky whose father belonged to the priestly class regards as
ideal the commune and the peasant guild artl with their
individualistic moral ideals of union in a spirit of brotherly love and
solidarity both in work and in the enjoyment of its products his
pessimism is directed against the Russian educated classes not
excepting even their very best representatives This view he expresses
in all his works which depict the educated classes The Golden Heart
The Wanderer The Kremlff Family The Karaveffs The Hetman
and so forth In these he represents educated peoplethe better
classes called intelligent people by Russiansunder the guise of
sheep who have strayed from the true fold and the only thing about them
which he regards as a sign of life in a few of the best of them is
their vain efforts to identify themselves with the common people and
thus as it were restore the lost paradise

There are many others who have written sketches and more ambitious works
founded on a more or less intimate study and knowledge of the peasants
On one of these we must turn our attention briefly as the author of
one famous and heartrending book The Inhabitants of Podlpovo Fedor
Mikhilovitch Ryeshtnikoff  was one of three middleclass
plebeian is the Russian word writers who made a name the others
being Alexnder Ivnovitch Levtoff and Nikoli Ivnovitch Namoff For
in proportion as culture spread among the masses of society and the
center of the intellectual movement was transferred from the noble class
to the plebeian in the literary circles towards the end of the s
there appeared a great flood of new forces from the lower classes The
three writers above mentioned as well as Uspnsky and Zlatovrtsky
belonged to the priestly plebeian class Ryeshtnikoffs famous
romancerather a short storywas the outcome of his own hardships
sufferings and experiences He was scantily educated had no sthetic
taste wrote roughly not always grammatically and always in
excessively gloomy colors yet he had the reputation of being a
passionate lover of the people despite the fact that his picture of the
peasants in his best known work is generally regarded as almost a
caricature in its exaggerated gloom and he enjoys wide popularity even
at the present time

                                   

The spirits of people rose during the epoch of Reform after the
Emancipation of the serfs in  and the general impulse to take an
interest in political and social questions was speedily reflected in
literature by the formation of a special branch of that art which was
known as tendency literature although its more accurate title would
have been publicist literature The peculiarity of most writers of
this class was their pessimistic skepticism This publicist literature
was divided into three classes democratic moderately liberal and
conservative

At the head of the democratic branch stood the great writer who
constituted the pride and honor of the epoch as the one who most
profoundly and fully reflected it Mikhil Evgrfovitch Saltykff
 He was the son of landed proprietors of an ancient family
with a famous name of Tatr descent He finished his education in the
Tzrskoe Sel Lyceum which from the time of Pshkin on graduated so
many notable statesmen and distinguished men The authorities of the
Lyceum were endeavoring to exterminate the spirit of Pshkin who had
died only the year before and severely repressed all scribbling of
poetry which did not in the least prevent almost every boy in the
school from trying his hand at it and dreaming of future fame Thus
incited Saltykff from the moment of his entrance earned the illwill
of the authorities by his passionate love of verse writing and reading
and when he graduated in  it was in the lower half of his class
and with one rank lower in the civil service than the upper half of the
class

In  he published under the name of M Nepnoff his first story
Contradictions and in  his second A Tangled Affair both in
The Annals of the Fatherland When the strictness of the censorship
was augmented during that same year after the Petrashvsky affair
all literary men fell under suspicion When Saltykff asked for leave of
absence from the service to go home during the holidays he was
commanded to produce his writings Although these early writings
contained hardly a hint of the satirical talents which he afterwards
developed the person to whom was intrusted the task of making a report
of them and who was a sworn enemy to the natural school and The Annals
of the Fatherland gave such an alarming account of them that the Count
Tchrnysheff was frightened at having so dangerous a man in his
ministerial department The result was that in May  a
postingtrka halted in front of Saltykffs lodgings and the
accompanying gendarme was under orders to escort the offender off to
Vytka on the instant

In Saltykffs case as in the case of many another Russian writer
exile not only removed him from the distracting pleasures of life at the
capital but also laid the foundation for his future greatness In
Vytka Saltykff first served as one of the officials in the government
office but by the autumn he was appointed the official for special
commissions immediately attached to the governors service He was a
valued friend in the family of the vicegovernor for whose young
daughters he wrote a Short History of Russia and after winning
further laurels in the service he was allowed to return to St
Petersburg in  when he married one of the young girls and
published his Governmental Sketches with the materials for which his
exile had furnished him Two years later he was appointed vicegovernor
of Ryazn then transferred to Tver where he acted as governor on
several occasions In  he retired from the service and devoted
himself to literature but he returned to it a couple of years later
and only retired definitively in  These items are of interest as
showing the status of political exiles in a different light from that
usually accepted as the unvarying rule

As we have said Saltykffs exile was of incalculable service to him
in that it made him acquainted with the inward life of Russia and of the
people This knowledge he put to unsparing use in his famous satires In
order fully to understand his works one must be thoroughly familiar
with the general spirit and the special ideas of the different periods
to which they refer as well as with Russia and its life and literature
in general Saltykff who wrote under the name of Shtchedrn was
very keen to catch the spirit of the moment and very caustic in
portraying it with the result that very often the names he invented for
his characters clove to whole classes of society and have become
bywords the mere mention of which reproduces the whole type For
example after the Emancipation when the majority of landed proprietors
were compelled to give up their parasitic life on the serfs there arose
a class of educated people who were seeking fresh fields for their easy
parasitic existence One of the commonest expedients in the s for
restoring shattered finances was to go to Tashknt where the cultured
classes imagined that regular gold mines awaited them Saltykff
instantly detected this movement and not only branded the pioneers in
the colonization of Central Asia with the name of Tashkntzians in
Gospod Tashkntzy Messrs Tashkntzians but according to his wont
he rendered this nickname general by applying it to all cultured classes
who had nothing in their souls but an insatiable appetite In other
works he branded other movements and classes with equal
ineffaceableness

His masterpiece in his third and most developed period the work which
foreigners can comprehend almost equally well with Russians is Gospod
Golovlvy The Messrs Golovlff It contains that element of
the universal in humanity which his national satires lack and it alone
would suffice to render him immortal The type of Idiushka little
Judas has no superior in all European literature for its cold
calculating cynical hypocrisy its miserly ferocity The book is a
presentment of old antereform manners among the landed gentry at their
worst

The following favorite little story furnishes an excellent example of
Saltykffs Shtchedrns caustic wit and satire

THE STORY OF HOW ONE PEASANT MAINTAINED TWO GENERALS

     Once upon a time there lived and flourished two Generals and
     as both were giddypated by jesting command at my desire
     they were speedily transported to an uninhabited island

     The Generals had served all their lives in some registry office
     or other they had been born there reared there had grown old
     there and consequently they understood nothing whatever They
     did not even know any words except accept the assurance of my
     complete respect and devotion

     The registry was abolished as superfluous and the Generals
     were set at liberty Being thus on the retired list they
     settled in Petersburg in Podytchesky Pettifoggers Street
     in separate quarters each had his own cook and received a
     pension But all of a sudden they found themselves on an
     uninhabited island and when they awoke they saw that they
     were lying under one coverlet Of course at first they could
     not understand it at all and they began to talk as though
     nothing whatever had happened to them

     Tis strange your Excellency I had a dream today said one
     General I seemed to be living on a desert island

     No sooner had he said this than he sprang to his feet The
     other General did the same

     Heavens Whats the meaning of this Where are we cried
     both with one voice

     Then they began to feel each other to discover whether this
     extraordinary thing had happened to them not in a dream but in
     their waking hours But try as they might to convince
     themselves that all this was nothing but a vision of their
     sleep they were forced to the conviction of its sad reality

     On one side of them stretched the sea on the other side lay a
     small plot of land and beyond it again stretched the same
     boundless sea The Generals began to weep for the first time
     since the registry office had been closed

     They began to gaze at each other and they then perceived that
     they were clad only in their nightshirts and on the neck of
     each hung an order

     How good a little coffee would taste now ejaculated one
     General but then he remembered what unprecedented adventure
     had happened to him and he began to cry again

     But what are we to do he continued through his tears if
     we were to write a report of what use would it be

     This is what we must do replied the other General Do you
     go to the east your Excellency and I will go to the west and
     in the evening we will meet again at this place perhaps we
     shall find something

     So they began their search to find which was the east and which
     the west They recalled to mind that their superior official
     had once said If you wish to find the east stand with your
     eyes towards the north and you will find what you want on your
     right hand They began to seek the north and placed
     themselves first in one position then in another and tried
     all quarters of the compass in turn but as they had spent
     their whole lives in the registry office they could decide on
     nothing

     This is what we must do your Excellency do you go to the
     right and I will go to the left that will be better said
     the General who besides serving in the registry office had
     also served as instructor of calligraphy in the school for
     soldiers sons and consequently had more sense

     So said so done One General went to the right and saw trees
     growing and on the trees all sorts of fruits The General
     tried to get an apple but all the apples grew so high that it
     was necessary to climb for them He tried to climb but with no
     result except that he tore his shirt to rags The General came
     to a stream the fish were swimming there in swarms as though
     in a fishshop on the Fontnka canal If we only had such fish
     in Pettifoggers Street said the General to himself and he
     even changed countenance with hunger

     The General entered the forest and there hazelhens were
     whistling blackcocks were holding their bragging matches and
     hares were running

     Heavens What victuals What victuals said the General and
     he felt that he was becoming fairly sick at his stomach with
     hunger

     There was nothing to be done he was obliged to return to the
     appointed place with empty hands He reached it but the other
     General was already waiting for him

     Well your Excellency have you accomplished anything

     Yes I have found an old copy of the Moscow News that is
     all

     The Generals lay down to sleep again but gnawing hunger kept
     them awake They were disturbed by speculations as to who
     would receive their pension for them then they recalled the
     fruits fish hazelhens blackcock and hares which they had
     seen that day

     Who would have thought your Excellency that human food in
     its original shape flies swims and grows on trees said one
     General

     Yes replied the other General I must confess that until
     this day I thought that wheaten rolls came into existence in
     just the form in which they are served to us in the morning
     with our coffee

     It must be that for instance if one desires to eat a
     partridge he must first catch it kill it pluck it roast
     it But how is all that done

     How is all that done repeated the other General like an
     echo They fell into silence and tried to get to sleep but
     hunger effectually banished sleep Hazelhens turkeys
     suckingpigs flitted before their eyes rosy veiled in a
     slight blush of roasting surrounded with cucumbers pickles
     and other salads

     It seems to me that I could eat my own boots now said one
     General

     Gloves are good also when they have been worn a long time
     sighed the other General

     All at once the Generals glanced at each other an ominous fire
     glowed in their eyes their teeth gnashed a dull roar forced
     its way from their breasts They began slowly to crawl toward
     each other and in the twinkling of an eye they were
     exasperated to fury Tufts of hair flew about whines and
     groans resounded the General who had been a teacher of
     calligraphy bit off his adversarys Order and immediately
     swallowed it But the sight of flowing blood seemed to restore
     them to their senses

     The power of the cross defend us they exclaimed
     simultaneously if we go on like this we shall eat each
     other

     And how did we get here What malefactor has played us this
     trick

     We must divert our minds with some sort of conversation your
     Excellency or there will be murder said the other General

     Begin replied the other General

     Well for instance what do you think about this Why does the
     sun rise first and then set instead of acting the other way
     about

     You are a queer man your Excellency dont you rise first
     then go to the office write there and afterward go to bed

     But why not admit this reversal of the order first I go to
     bed have divers dreams and then rise

     Hm yes But I must confess that when I served in the
     department I always reasoned in this fashion now it is
     morning then it will be day then supper will be served and
     it will be time to go to bed

     But the mention of supper plunged them both into grief and
     broke the conversation off short at the very beginning

     I have heard a doctor say that a man can live for a long time
     on his own juices began one of the Generals

     Is that so

     Yes sir it is it appears that the juices proper produce
     other juices these in their turn engender still other juices
     and so on until at last the juices cease altogether

     What then

     Then it is necessary to take some sort of nourishment

     Tfu

     In short no matter what topic of conversation the Generals
     started it led inevitably to a mention of food and this
     excited their appetites still more They decided to cease their
     conversation and calling to mind the copy of the Moscow News
     which they had found they began to read it with avidity

     Yesterday read one General with a quivering voice the
     respected governor of our ancient capital gave a grand dinner
     The table was set for one hundred persons with wonderful
     luxury The gifts of all lands seemed to have appointed a
     rendezvous at this magical feast There was the golden sterlet
     of the Sheksna the pheasant nursling of the Caucasian
     forests and strawberries that great rarity in our north in
     the month of February

     Tfu heavens Cannot your Excellency find some other subject
     cried the other General in desperation and taking the
     newspaper from his companions hand he read the following A
     correspondent writes to us from Tla There was a festival
     here yesterday at the club on the occasion of a sturgeon being
     caught in the river Up an occurrence which not even old
     residents can recall the more so as private Warden B was
     recognized in the sturgeon The author of the festival was
     brought in on a huge wooden platter surrounded with cucumbers
     and holding a bit of green in his mouth Doctor P who was on
     duty that day as presiding officer saw to it carefully that
     each of the guests received a piece The sauce was extremely
     varied and even capricious 

     Permit me your Excellency you also seem to be not
     sufficiently cautious in your choice of reading matter
     interrupted the first General and taking the paper in his
     turn he read A correspondent writes to us from Vytka One
     of the old residents here has invented the following original
     method of preparing fish soup Take a live turbot and whip
     him as a preliminary when his liver has become swollen with
     rage 

     The Generals dropped their heads Everything on which they
     turned their eyeseverything bore witness to food Their own
     thoughts conspired against them for try as they would to
     banish the vision of beefsteak this vision forced itself upon
     them

     And all at once an idea struck the General who had been a
     teacher of calligraphy

     How would it do your Excellency he said joyfully if we
     were to find a peasant

     That is to say  a muzhk

     Yes exactly a common muzhk  such as muzhks generally
     are He would immediately give us rolls and he would catch
     hazelhens and fish

     Hm  a peasant  but where shall we find him when he is
     not here

     What do you mean by saying that he is not to be found There
     are peasants everywhere and all we have to do is to look him
     up He is certainly hiding somewhere about because he is too
     lazy to work This idea cheered the Generals to such a degree
     that they sprang to their feet like men who had received a
     shock and set out to find a peasant

     They roamed for a long time about the island without any
     success whatever but at last the penetrating smell of
     breadcrust and sour sheepskin put them on the track Under a
     tree flat on his back with his fists under his head lay a
     huge peasant fast asleep and shirking work in the most
     impudent manner There were no bounds to the wrath of the
     Generals

     Asleep lazybones and they flung themselves upon him and
     you dont move so much as an ear when here are two Generals
     who have been dying of hunger these two days March off this
     moment to work

     The man rose he saw that the Generals were stern He would
     have liked to give them the slip but they had become fairly
     rigid when they grasped him

     And he began to work under their supervision

     First of all he climbed a tree and picked half a score of the
     ripest apples for the Generals and took one a sour one for
     himself Then he dug in the earth and got some potatoes then
     he took two pieces of wood rubbed them together and produced
     fire Then he made a snare from his own hair and caught a
     hazelhen Last of all he arranged the fire and cooked such a
     quantity of different provisions that the idea even occurred to
     the Generals would it not be well to give the lazy fellow a
     little morsel

     The Generals watched the peasants efforts and their hearts
     played merrily They had already forgotten that they had nearly
     died of hunger on the preceding day and they thought What a
     good thing it is to be a generalthen you never go to
     destruction anywhere

     Are you satisfied Generals asked the big lazy peasant

     We are satisfied my dear friend we perceive your zeal
     replied the Generals

     Will you not permit me to rest now

     Rest my good friend only first make us a rope

     The peasant immediately collected wild hemp soaked it in
     water beat it worked itand by evening the rope was done
     With this rope the Generals bound the peasant to a tree so that
     he should not run away and then they lay down to sleep

     One day passed then another the big coarse peasant became so
     skilful that he even began to cook soup in the hollow of his
     hand Our Generals became jovial lighthearted fat and
     white They began to say to each other that here they were
     living with everything ready to hand while their pensions were
     accumulating and accumulating in Petersburg

     What do you think your Excellency was there really a tower
     of Babel or is that merely a fable one General would say to
     the other as they ate their breakfast

     I think your Excellency that it really was built because
     otherwise how can we explain the fact that many different
     languages exist in the world

     Then the flood must have occurred also

     The flood did happen otherwise how could the existence of
     antediluvian animals be explained The more so as it is
     announced in the Moscow News

     Shall we not read the Moscow News

     Then they would hunt up that copy seat themselves in the
     shade and read it through from end to end what people had
     been eating in Moscow eating in Tla eating in Pnza eating
     in Ryaznand it had no effect on them it did not turn their
     stomachs

     In the long run the Generals got bored They began to refer
     more and more frequently to the cooks whom they had left behind
     them in Petersburg and they even wept on the sly

     What is going on now in Pettifoggers Street your Excellency
     one General asked the other

     Dont allude to it your Excellency My whole heart is sore
     replied the other General

     It is pleasant here very pleasantthere are no words to
     describe it but still it is awkward for us to be all alone
     isnt it And I regret my uniform also

     Of course you do Especially as it is of the fourth class
     so that it makes you dizzy to gaze at the embroidery alone

     Then they began to urge the peasant Take them take them to
     Pettifoggers Street And behold The peasant it appeared even
     knew all about Pettifoggers Street had been there his mouth
     had watered at it but he had not had a taste of it

     And we are Generals from Pettifoggers Street you know cried
     the Generals joyfully

     And I also if you had only observed a man hangs outside a
     house in a box from a rope and washes the wall with color
     or walks on the roof like a fly I am that man replied the
     peasant

     And the peasant began to cut capers as though to amuse his
     Generals because they had been kind to him an idle sluggard
     and had not scorned his peasant toil And he built a shipnot
     a ship exactly but a boatso that they could sail across the
     oceansea up to Pettifoggers Street

     But look to it you rascal that you dont drown us said the
     Generals when they saw the craft pitching on the waves

     Be easy Generals this is not my first experience replied
     the peasant and began to make preparations for departure

     The peasant collected soft swansdown and lined the bottom of
     the boat with it having done this he placed the Generals on
     the bottom made the sign of the cross over them and set sail
     The pen cannot describe neither can the tongue relate what
     terror the Generals suffered during their journey from storms
     and divers winds But the peasant kept on rowing and rowing
     and fed the Generals on herrings

     At last behold Mother Nev and the splendid Katherine Canal
     and great Pettifoggers Street The cookmaids clasped their
     hands in amazement at the sight of their Generals so fat
     white and merry The Generals drank their coffee ate rolls
     made with milk eggs and butter and put on their uniforms
     Then they went to the treasury and the pen cannot describe
     neither can the tongue relate how much money they received
     there

     But they did not forget the peasant they sent him a wineglass
     of vdka and a silver fivekopk piece Make merry big
     coarse peasant

While Turgneff represented the western and liberal element with a
tinge of the red in the school of the s and Gontcharff stood
for the bourgeois and opportunist ideals of the St Petersburg
bureaucrats Count Lyff Nikolevitch Tolsty penetrated more profoundly
into the depths of the spirit of the times than any other writer of the
period in the matter of analysis and skepticism which characterized that
school and carried them to the extremes of pitiless logic and
radicalness approaching more closely than any other to democratic and
national ideals But notwithstanding all his genius Count Tolsty was
not able to free himself to any great extent from his epoch his
environment his contemporaries His special talents merely caused him
to find it impossible to reconcile himself to the state of affairs
existing around him and so instead of progressing he turned back and
sought peace of mind and a firm doctrine in the distant past of
primitive Christianity Sincere as he undoubtedly is in his propaganda
of selfsimplification and selfperfectionone might almost call it
selfannihilationhis new attitude has wrought great and most
regrettable havoc with his later literary work with some few
exceptions

And yet in pursuing this course he did not strike out an entirely new
path for himself his youth was passed in an epoch when the ideal of
personal perfection and selfsurrender stood in the foreground and
constituted the very essence of Russian progress

Count L N Tolsty was born on August  O S  September th
N S in the village of Ysnaya Polyna in the government of Tla
His mother born Princess Volknsky Mrya Nikolevna died before he
was two years old and his fathers sister Countess A T OstenSaken
and a distant relative Madame T A Erglsky took charge of him When
he was nine years old the family removed to Moscow and his father died
soon afterwards Lyff Nikolevitch his brother Dmtry and his sister
Mrya then returned to the country estate while his elder brother
Nikoli remained in Moscow with Countess OstenSaken and studied at the
University of Moscow Three years later the Countess OstenSaken died
and another aunt on the fathers side Madame P I Yshkoff who
resided in Kazn became their guardian Lyff Nikolevitch went there
to live and in  he entered the University of Kazn in the
philological course but remained in it only one year because the
professor of history who had quarreled with Tolstys relatives gave
him impossibly bad marks in addition to which he received bad marks
from the professor of German although he was better acquainted with
that language than any other member of his course He was compelled to
change to the law course where he remained for two years In  he
took the examination for candidate in the University of St
Petersburg I knew literally nothing he says of himself and I
literally began to prepare myself for the examination only one week in
advance He obtained his degree of candidate or bachelor of arts and
returned to Ysnaya Polyna where he lived until  when he entered
the Fortyfourth Battery of the Twentieth Brigade of Artillery as
ynker or supernumerary officer with no official rank but eligible
to receive a commission as ensign and thence advance in the service
This battery was stationed on the Trek River in the Caucasus and
there Tolsty remained with it until the Crimean War broke out Thus
during the first twentysix years of his life he spent less than five
years in towns the rest in the country and this no doubt laid the
foundation for his deep love for country life which has had so profound
an effect upon his writings and his views of existence in general

The dawning of his talent came during the four years he spent in the
Caucasus and he wrote Childhood The Incursion Boyhood The
Morning of a Landed Proprietor and The Cossacks During the Turkish
campaign he was ordered to the staff of Prince M D Gortchakff on the
Danube and in  received the command of a mountain battery and took
part in the fight at Tchrnaya and the siege of Sevastpol The
literary fruits of this experience were Sevastpol in December May
and August three sketches

It is convenient to finish his statistical history at this point with
the statement that in  he married having firmly resolved two years
previously that he never would do so and clinched the bargain with
himself by selling the big manorhouse at Ysnaya Polyna for
transportation and reerection elsewhere Between that date and  he
had a family of fifteen children of whom seven are still alive

In his very first efforts in literature we detect certain
characteristics which continue to distinguish him throughout his career
and some of which on attaining their legitimate and logical development
seem to the ordinary reader to be of extremely recent origin In
Childhood and Boyhood Youth the third section was written late
in the s we meet the same keen analysis which is a leading feature
in his later works and in them is applied with such effect to women and
to the tender passion neither of which elements enters into his early
works in any appreciable degree He displays the most astounding genius
in detecting and understanding the most secret and trivial movements of
the human soul In this respect his methods are those of a miniature
painter Another point must be borne in mind in studying Tolstys
characters that unlike Turgneff who is almost exclusively objective
Tolsty is in the highest degree subjective and has presented a study
of his own life and soul in almost every one of his works in varying
degrees and combined with widely varying elements In the same way he
has made use of the spiritual and mental state of his relatives For
example who can fail to recognize a selfportrait from the life in
Levn Anna Karnin and in Prince Andri Bolknsky War and
Peace And the feminine characters in these great novels are either
simple or composite portraits of his nearest relations while many of
the incidents in both novels are taken straight from their experience or
his own or the two combined

It is useless to catalogue his many works with their dates in this
place Unquestionably the finest of them despite the authors present
erroneous view that they constitute a sin and a reproach to him are
his magnificent War and Peace and Anna Karnin Curiously enough
neither met with prompt or enthusiastic welcome in Russia when they
first made their appearance The public had grown used to the very
different methods of the other celebrated romancewriters of the s
with whom we have already dealt Gontcharff had accustomed them to the
delineation of character by broad sweeping strokes Dostovsky to
lancetlike thrusts penetrating the very soul Turgneff to tender
touches which produced soft melting outlines It was long before they
could reconcile themselves to Tolstys original mode of painting a vast
series of miniature portraits on an immense canvas But the effect of
this procedure was at last recognized to be the very acme of throbbing
breathing life itself Moreover it became apparent that Tolstys
theory of life was that great generals statesmen and as a whole all
active persons who seem or try to control events do nothing of the
kind Somewhere above in the unknown there is a power which guides
affairs at its own will and here is the special point deliberately
thwarts all the efforts of the active people According to his
philosophy the selfcontained thoroughly egotistical natures who are
wedded solely to the cult of success generally pass through this
earthly life without any notable disasters they attend strictly to
their own selfish ends and do not attempt to sway the destinies of
others from motives of humanity patriotism or anything else in the
lofty selfsacrificing line On the contrary the fate of the people
who are endowed with tender instincts who have not allowed selflove to
smother their humanity who are guilty only of striving to attain some
lofty unselfish object in life are thwarted and repressed balked and
confounded at every turn This is particularly interesting in view of
his latterday exhortations to men on the duty of toiling for others
sacrificing everything for others Nevertheless it must stand as a
monument to the fidelity of his powers of analysis of life in general
and of the individual characters in whose lot he demonstrates his
theory

This contrast between the two conflicting principles a haughty
individualism and peaceable submission to a higher power of which the
concrete representative is the mass of the population is set forth with
especial clearness in War and Peace where the two principal heroes
Prince Andri Bolknsky and Pierre Bezkoff represent individualism

In Anna Karnin in the person of his favorite hero Konstantn Levn
Tolsty first enunciates the doctrine of moral regeneration acquired by
means of physical labor and his later philosophical doctrines are the
direct development of the views there set forth He had represented a
hero of much earlier days Prince Nekhlidoff in The Morning of a
Landed Proprietor as convinced that he should make himself of use to
his peasants and he had set forth the result of those efforts in terms
which tally wonderfully well with his direct personal comments in My
Confession of a date long posterior to Anna Karnin Have my
peasants become any the richer he writes have they been educated or
developed morally Not in the slightest degree They are no better off
and my heart grows more heavy with every passing day If I could but
perceive any success in my undertaking if I could descry any
gratitudebut no I see false routine vice distrust helplessness I
am wasting the best years of my life in vain

But NekhlidoffTolsty was not alone in devoting himself to his
peasants before he withdrew to the country he had led a gay life in St
Petersburg after resigning from the army and in writing his fine
peasant story Polikshka setting up peasantschools on his estate
and the like he was merely paying his tribute to the spirit of the time
which reached him even in his seclusion and imitating the innumerable
village schools and Sunday schools in the capitals for secular
instruction of the laboring classes who were too busy for education
during the week in which the aristocratic and educated classes in
general took a lively interest But the leisure afforded by country
life enabled him to compose his masterpieces War and Peace which was
begun in  was published serially in The Russian Messenger
beginning in  and in book form in  and Anna Karnin which
was published serially in the same journal in  His style is
not to be compared to that of Turgneff with its exquisite harmony
art and sense of proportion Tolsty writes carelessly frequently
repeats himself not infrequently expresses himself ambiguously or
obscurely But the supreme effect is produced nevertheless

At last came the diametrical change of views apparently which led to
this supreme artists discarding his art and devoting himself to
religious and philosophical writings for which neither nature nor his
training had fitted him He himself dates this change from the middle of
the s and it must be noted that precisely at this period that
strong movement called going to the people i e devoting ones self
to the welfare of the peasants became epidemic in Russian society
Again as fifteen or twenty years previously Count Tolsty was merely
swept onward by the popular current But his first pamphlet on his new
propaganda is ten years later than the date he assigns to the change
Thereafter for many years he devoted his chief efforts to this new class
of work Life What Is to Be Done My Confession and so forth
being the more bulky outcome Some of the stories written for the
people during this interval are delightful both in tone and artistic
qualities Others are surcharged with morals which in many cases
either directly conflict with the moral of other stories in the same
volume or even with the secondary moral of the same story Even his
last workin my former style as he described itResurrection has
special doctrines and aims too emphatically insisted upon to permit of
the reader deriving from it the pure literary pleasure afforded by his
masterpieces In short with all due respect to the entire sincerity of
this magnificent writer it must be said that those who would enjoy and
appreciate him rightly should ignore his philosophicoreligious
treatises which are contradictory and confusing to the last degree As
an illustration let me cite the case of the famine in Russia of
 Great sums of money were sent to Count Tolsty chiefly
from America and were expended by him in the most practicable and
irreproachable mannerso any one would have supposedfor the relief of
the starving peasants Count Tolsty and his assistants lived the life
of the peasants and underwent severe hardships the Count even fell
ill and his wife was obliged to go to him and nurse him It would seem
that his conscience had no cause for reproach and that the situation
was an ideal one for him But before that famine was well over or the
funds expended he wrote a letter to a London newspaper in which he
declared that helping people by means of money was all wrongpositively
a sin He felt that collecting and distributing money was not the best
thing of which he was capable and called it making a pipe of ones
self personal service with brains heart and muscles being the only
right service for God or man This service he certainly rendered and
without the money he could not have rendered it

Nothing could more perfectly illustrate this point of view than the
following little story written in  called The Two Brothers and
the Gold

     In ancient times there lived not far from Jerusalem two
     brothers the elder Afansy the younger Ionn They dwelt on a
     hill not far from the town and subsisted on what people gave
     them Every day the brothers spent in work They did not toil
     at their own work but at the work of the poor Wherever there
     were men overwhelmed with work wherever there were sick
     people orphans and widows thither went the brothers and
     there they toiled and nursed the people accepting no
     remuneration In this wise did the brothers pass the whole week
     apart and met only on Saturday evening in their abode Only on
     Sunday did they remain at home praying and chatting together
     And the angel of the Lord descended to them and blessed them
     On Monday they parted and each went his way Thus the two
     brothers lived for many years and every week the angel of the
     Lord came down and blessed them

     One Monday as the brothers were starting out to work and had
     already separated going in different directions Afansy felt
     sorry to part with his beloved brother and halted and glanced
     back Ionn was walking with head bowed in his own direction
     and did not look back But all of a sudden Ionn also halted
     and as though catching sight of something began to gaze
     intently in that direction shading his eyes with his hand
     Then he approached what he had espied there suddenly leaped to
     one side and without looking behind him fled down the hill and
     up the hill away from the spot as though a fierce wild beast
     were pursuing him Afansy was amazed and went back to the
     place in order to find out what had so frightened his brother
     As he came near he beheld something gleaming in the sunlight
     He approached closer On the grass as though poured out of a
     measure lay a heap of gold And Afansy was the more
     amazed both at the gold and at his brothers leap

     What was he frightened at and what did he flee from said
     Afansy to himself There is no sin in gold the sin is in
     man One can do evil with gold but one can also do good with
     it How many orphans and widows can be fed how many naked men
     clothed how many poor and sick healed with this gold We now
     serve people but our service is small according to the
     smallness of our strength but with this gold we can serve
     people more Afansy reasoned thus with himself and wished to
     tell it all to his brother but Ionn had gone off out of
     earshot and was now visible on the opposite mountain no
     bigger than a beetle

     And Afansy took of his garment raked into it as much gold as
     he was able to carry flung it on his shoulders and carried it
     to the city He came to the inn gave the gold over to the
     innkeeper and went back after the remainder And when he had
     brought all the gold he went to the merchants bought land in
     the town bought stone and timber hired workmen and began to
     build three houses And Afansy dwelt three months in the town
     and built three houses in the town one house an asylum for
     widows and orphans another house a hospital for the sick and
     the needy a third house for pilgrims and paupers And Afansy
     sought out three pious old men and he placed one over the
     asylum another over the hospital and the third over the
     hostelry for pilgrims And Afansy had three thousand gold
     pieces left And he gave a thousand to each old man to
     distribute to the poor And people began to fill all three
     houses and men began to laud Afansy for what he had done
     And Afansy rejoiced thereat so that he did not wish to leave
     the city But Afansy loved his brother and bidding the people
     farewell and keeping not a single gold piece for himself he
     went back to his abode in the same old garment in which he had
     quitted it

     Afansy came to his mountain and said to himself My brother
     judged wrongly when he sprang away from the gold and fled from
     it Have not I done better

     And no sooner had Afansy thought this than suddenly he
     beheld standing in his path and gazing sternly at him that
     angel who had been wont to bless them And Afansy was
     stupefied with amazement and could utter only Why is this
     Lord And the angel opened his mouth and said Get thee
     hence Thou art not worthy to dwell with thy brother Thy
     brothers one leap is more precious than all the deeds which
     thou hast done with thy gold

     And Afansy began to tell of how many paupers and wanderers he
     had fed how many orphans he had cared for and the angel said
     to him That devil who placed the gold there to seduce thee
     hath also taught thee these words

     And then did Afansys conscience convict him and he
     understood that he had not done his deeds for the sake of God
     and he fell to weeping and began to repent Then the angel
     stepped aside and left open to him the way on which Ionn was
     already standing awaiting his brother and from that time forth
     Afansy yielded no more to the temptation of the devil who had
     poured out the gold and knew that not by gold but only by
     labor can one serve God and men

     And the brothers began to live as before

Unfortunately the best of Tolstys peasant stories such as
Polikshka Two Old Men the latter belonging to the recent
hortatory period and the like are too long for reproduction here But
the moral of the following Little Girls Wiser than Old Men is
irreproachable and the style is the same as in the more important of
those written expressly for the people

     Easter fell early that year People had only just ceased to use
     sledges The snow still lay in the cottage yards but rivulets
     were flowing through the village a big puddle had formed
     between the cottages from the dungheaps and two little
     girls from different cottages met by this puddleone
     younger the other older Both little girls had been dressed in
     new frocks by their mothers The little ones frock was blue
     the big ones yellow with a flowered pattern Both had red
     kerchiefs bound about their heads The little girls came out to
     the puddle after the morning service in church displayed
     their clothes to each other and began to play And the fancy
     seized them to paddle in the water The younger girl was on the
     point of wading into the pool with her shoes on but the elder
     girl says Dont go Malsha thy mother will scold Come Ill
     take off my shoes and do thou take off thine The little
     lasses took off their shoes tucked up their frocks and waded
     into the puddle to meet each other Malsha went in up to her
     knees and says Its deep AkuliushkaIm afraid Never
     mind says she it wont get any deeper Come straight
     towards me They began to approach each other and Aklka
     says Look out Malsha dont splash but walk quietly No
     sooner had she spoken than Malsha set her foot down with a
     bang in the water and a splash fell straight on Aklkas
     frock The sarafn was splashed and some of it fell on her
     nose and in her eyes as well Aklka saw the spot on her frock
     got angry at Malsha stormed ran after her and wanted to
     beat her Malsha was frightened when she saw the mischief she
     had done leaped out of the puddle and ran home Aklkas
     mother came along espied the splashed frock and spattered
     chemise on her daughter Where didst thou soil thyself thou
     hussy Malsha splashed me on purpose Aklkas mother
     seized Malsha and struck her on the nape of the neck Malsha
     shrieked so that the whole street heard her Malshas mother
     came out What art thou beating my child for The neighbor
     began to rail One word led to another the women scolded each
     other The peasant men ran forth a big crowd assembled in the
     street Everybody shouted nobody listened to anybody else
     They scolded and scolded One gave another a punch and a
     regular fight was imminent when an old woman Aklkas
     grandmother interposed She advanced into the midst of the
     peasants and began to argue with them What are you about my
     good men Is this the season for such things We ought to be
     joyful but you have brought about a great sin They paid no
     heed to the old woman and almost knocked one another down and
     the old woman would not have been able to dissuade them had it
     not been for Aklka and Malsha While the women were
     wrangling Aklka wiped off her frock and went out again to
     the puddle in the space between the cottages She picked up a
     small stone and began to dig the earth out at the edge of the
     puddle so as to let the water out into the street While she
     was digging away Malsha came up also and began to help her
     by drawing the water down the ditch with a chip The peasant
     men had just come to blows when the little girls had got the
     water along the ditch to the street directly at the spot where
     the old woman was parting the men

     The little girls came running up one on one side the other on
     the other side of the rivulet Hold on Malsha hold on
     cried Aklka Malsha also tried to say something but could
     not speak for laughing

     The little girls ran thus laughing at the chip as it floated
     down the stream And they ran straight into the midst of the
     peasant men The old woman perceived them and said to the men
     Fear God Here you have begun to fight over these same little
     girls and they have forgotten all about it long ago and are
     playing together again in lovethe dear little things They
     are wiser than you

     The men looked at the little girls and felt ashamed of
     themselves and then the peasants began to laugh at themselves
     and went off to their houses

     Except ye become as little children ye shall not enter the
     kingdom of heaven

It is a pity that Count Tolsty the greatest literary genius of his
time should put his immense talent to such a use as to provoke on his
contradictions of himself comment like the following which is quoted
from a work by V S Soloviff an essayist and argumentative writer
who quotes some one on this subject to this effect

     Sometimes we hear that the most important truth is in the
     Sermon on the Mount then again we are told that we must till
     the soil in the sweat of our brows though there is nothing
     about that in the Gospels but in Genesisin the same place
     where giving birth in pain is mentioned but that is no
     commandment at all only a sad fate sometimes we are told that
     we ought to give everything away to the poor and then again
     that we never ought to give anything to anybody as money is an
     evil and one ought not to harm other people but only ones
     self and ones family but that we ought to work for others
     sometimes we are told that the vocation of women is to bear as
     many healthy children as possible and then the celibate ideal
     is held up for men and women then again eating no meat is the
     first step towards selfperfection though why no one knows
     then something is said against liquor and tobacco then against
     pancakes then against military service as if it were the worst
     thing on earth and as if the primary duty of a Christian were
     to refuse to be a soldier which would prove that he who is not
     taken into service for any reason is already holy enough

This may be a trifle exaggerated but it indicates clearly enough the
utter confusion which the teachings of Count Tolsty produce on
ordinary rational wellmeaning persons In short he should be
judged in his proper sphere as one of the most gifted authors of any age
or country and judged by his legitimate works in his legitimate
province the novel as exemplified by War and Peace and Anna
Karnin

The reform movement of the s of the nineteenth century ended in a
reaction which took possession of society as a whole during the s
Apathy dejection disenchantment superseded the previous exultation and
enthusiastic impulse to push forward in all directions Dull discontent
and irritation reigned in all classes of society and in all parties
Some were discontented with the reforms regarding them as premature
and even ruinous others on the contrary deemed them insufficient
curtailed only halfsatisfactory to the needs of the country and
merely exasperating to the public demands

These conditions created a special sort of literary school which made
its appearance in the middle of the s and attained its complete
development in the middle of the s We have seen that the same sort
of thing had taken place with every previous change in the public
sentiment The first thing which impresses one in this school is the
resurrection of artistic feeling a passion for beauty of imagery and
forms a careful and extremely elegant polish imparted to literary
productions in technique None of the authoritative and influential
critics preached the cult of pure art Yet Grshin the most promising
of the young authors of the day who was the very last person to be
suspected of that cult finished his works with the utmost care so that
in elegance of form and language they offer an example of faultless
perfection There can be no doubt that this renaissance of the artistic
element of poetry of beauty was closely connected with the subsidence
of the floodtide of public excitement and agitation which up to that
time had carried writers along with it into its whirlpools and granted
them neither the time nor the desire to polish and adorn their works
and revel in beauty of forms

Vsvolod Mikhilovitch Grshin the son of a petty landed proprietor in
the south of Russia was born in  Despite his repeated attacks of
profound melancholia which sometimes passed into actual insanity and
despite the brevity of his career he flung himself down stairs in a fit
of this sort and died in  he made a distinct and brilliant mark
in Russian literature

Grshins view of people in general was thus expressed All the people
whom I have known he says are divided along with other divisions of
which of course there are many the clever men and the fools the
Hamlets and the Don Quixotes the lazy and the active and so forth
into two categories or to speak more accurately they are distributed
between two extremes some are endowed so to speak with a good
selfconsciousness while the others have a bad selfconsciousness One
man lives and enjoys all his sensations if he eats he rejoices if he
looks at the sky he rejoices In short for such a man the mere process
of living is happiness But it is quite the reverse with the other sort
of man you may plate him with gold and he will continue to grumble
nothing satisfies him success in life affords him no pleasure even if
it be perfectly selfevident The man simply is incapable of
experiencing satisfaction he is incapable and that is the end of the
matter And in view of his personal disabilities it is not remarkable
that all his heroes should have belonged to the latter category in a
greater or less degree some of the incidents narrated being drawn
directly from his own experiences Such are The Red Flower his best
story which presents the hallucinations of a madman The Coward
Night Attalea Princeps and That Which Never Happened On the
other hand the following have no personal element The Meeting The
Orderly and the Officer The Diary of Soldier Ivnoff The Bears
Nadzhda Nikolevna and Proud Aggei

Another writer who has won some fame especially by his charming
sketches of Siberian life written during his exile in Siberia is
Grigry Alexndrovitch Matchtet born in  These sketches such as
The Second Truth We Have Conquered A Worldly Affair are both
true to nature and artistic and produce a deep impression

Much more talented and famous is Vladmir Galaktinovitch Korolnko
 also the author of fascinating Siberian sketches and of a more
ambitious work The Blind Musician One point to be noted about
Korolnko is that he never joined the pessimists or the party which
professed pseudopeasant tendencies and followed Count L N Tolstys
ideas but has always preserved his independence His first work a
delightful fantasy entitled Makrs Dream appeared in 
Korolnko has been sent to Siberia several times but now lives in
Russia proper and publishes a highclass monthly journal

Until quite recently opinion was divided as to whether Korolnko or
Tchkoff was the more talented and the coming great author As we
shall see presently that question seems to have been settled and in
part by Korolnkos friendly aid in favor of quite another person

Antn Pvlovitch Tchkoff pseudonym Tchekhonte  is the
descendant of a serf father and grandfather His volumes of short
stories Humorous Tales In the Gloaming Surly People are full
of humor and of brilliant wit His more ambitious efforts as to length
and artistic qualities the productions of his matured talent are The
Steppe Fires A Tiresome History Notes of an Unknown The
Peasant and so forth

Still another extremely talented writer who unfortunately has begun
to produce too rapidly for his own interest is Ignty Nikolevitch
Potpenko  the son of an officer in a Uhlan regiment and of a
Little Russian peasant mother His father afterwards became a priesta
very unusual change of vocation and classand the future writer
acquired intimate knowledge of views and customs in ecclesiastical
circles which he put to brilliant use later on A delicate humor is the
characteristic feature of his work as can be seen in his best writings
such as On Active Service and The Secretary of His Grace the
Bishop

The former is the story of a talented and devoted young priest who
might have obtained an easy position in the town among the bishops
officials with certain prospect of swift promotion He resolutely
declines this position and requests that he may be assigned to a
village parish where he can be on active service Every one regards
the request as a sign of an unsettled mind After much argument he
prevails on his betrothed brides parents to permit the marriage he
cannot be ordained until he is married and hopes to find a helpmeet
in her The rest of the story deals with his experiences in the
unenviable position of a village priest where he has to contend not
only with the displeasure of his young wife but with the avarice of his
church staff the defects of the peasants the excess of attention of
the local gentlewoman and financial problems of the most trying
description It ends in his wife abandoning him and returning with her
child to her fathers house while he insists on remaining at his post
where as events have abundantly proved the ministrations of a truly
disinterested devout priest are most sadly needed It is impossible to
convey by description the charm and gentle humor of this book

But acclaimed on all sides by all classes of society as the most
talented writer of the present day is the young man who writes under
the name of Maxm Grky Bitter The majority of the critics
confidently predict that he is the longexpected successor of Count
L N Tolsty This gifted man who at one stroke conquered for himself
all Russia which reads whose books sell with unprecedented rapidity
whose name passes from mouth to mouth of millions wherever intellectual
life glows and has won an unnumbered host of enthusiastic admirers all
over the world came up from the depths of the populace

Grky Alexi Maxmovitch Pyeshkff was born in Nzhni Nvgorod in 
or  Socially he belongs to the petty burgher class but his
grandfather on the paternal side was reduced from an officer to the
ranks by the Emperor Nicholas I for harsh treatment of the soldiers
under his command He was such a rough character that his son the
authors father ran away from home five times in the course of seven
years and definitively parted from his uncongenial family at the age
of seventeen when he went afoot from Toblsk to Nzhni Nvgorod where
he apprenticed himself to a paperhanger Later on he became the
officemanager of a steamer company in strakhan His mother was the
daughter of a man who began his career as a bargee on the Volga one of
the lowest class of men who before the advent of steam hauled the
merchandiseladen barks from strakhan to Nzhni Nvgorod against the
current Afterwards he became a dyer of yarns and eventually
established a thriving dyeing establishment in Nzhni

Grkys father died of cholera at strakhan when the lad was four years
old His mother soon married again and gave the boy to his grandfather
who had him taught to read and write and then sent him to school where
he remained only five months At the end of that time he caught
smallpox and his studies were never renewed Meanwhile his mother died
and his grandfather was ruined financially so Grky at nine years of
age became the boy in a shoeshop where he spent two months scalded
his hands with cabbage soup and was sent back to his grandfather His
relations treated him with hostility or indifference and on his
recovery apprenticed him to a draftsman from whose harshness he
promptly fled and entered the shop of a painter of holy pictures Next
he became scullion on a river steamer and the cook was the first to
inculcate in him a love of reading and of good literature Next he
became gardeners boy then tried to get an education at Kazn
University under the mistaken impression that education was free To
keep from starving he became assistant in a bakery at three rubles a
month the hardest work I ever tried he says sawed wood carried
heavy burdens peddled apples on the wharf and tried to commit suicide
out of sheer want and misery Konovloff and Men with Pasts
would seem to represent some of the experiences of this period
Konovloff being regarded as one of his best stories Then he went to
Tzartzyn where he obtained employment as watchman on a railway was
called back to Nzhni Nvgorod for the conscription but was not
accepted as a soldier such holy men not being wanted He became a
peddler of beer then secretary to a lawyer who exercised great
influence on his education But he felt out of place and in  went
back to Tzartzyn then to the Don Province of the Kazks to the
Ukrana and Bessarbia back along the southern shore of the Crimea to
the Kubn and thence to the Caucasus The reader of his inimitable
short stories can trace these peregrinations and the adventures incident
to them In Tifls he worked in the railway shops and in  printed
his first literary effort Makr Tchdra in a local newspaper the
Kavkz In the following year in Nzhni Nvgorod he made
acquaintance with Korolnko to whom he is indebted for getting into
great literature and for sympathy and advice When he published
Tchelksh in  his fate was settled It is regarded as one of the
purest gems of Russian literature He immediately rose to honor and all
his writings since that time have appeared in the leading publications
Moreover he is the most fashionable writer in the country But he
enjoys something more than mere popularity he is deeply loved This is
the result of the young artists remarkable talent for painting
absolutely living pictures of both persons and things The
manysidedness of his geniusfor he has more than talentis shown
among other things by the fact that he depicts with equal success
landscapes genre scenes portraits of women His episode of the
singers in Fom Gordyeff pp  is regarded by Russian critics
as fully worthy of being compared with the scenes for which Turgneff is
renowned His landscape pictures are so beautiful that they cause a
throb of pain But as is almost inevitable under the circumstances
most of his stories have an element of coarseness which sometimes
repels

In general his subject is the uneasy man who is striving after
absolute freedom after light and a lofty ideal of which he can
perceive the existence somewhere though with all his efforts he cannot
grasp it We may assume that in this they represent Grky himself But
although all his heroes are seeking the meaning of life no two of them
are alike His characters like his landscapes grip the heart and once
known leave an ineffaceable imprint Although he propounds problems of
life among various classes he differs from the majority of people in
not regarding a full stomach as the panacea for the poor man On the
contrary as in Fom Gordyeff his most ambitious effort he seems
to regard precisely this as the cause of more ruin than the life of the
barefoot brigade the tramps and stepchildren of Dame Fortune with
whom he principally deals His motto seems to be Man shall not live by
bread alone And because Grky bears this thought ever with him in
brain and heart in nerves and his very marrow his work possesses a
strength which is almost terrifying combined with a beauty as
terrifying in its way If he will but develop his immense genius instead
of meddling with social and political questions and getting into prison
on that score with disheartening regularity something incalculably
great may be the outcome It is said that he is now banished in polite
exile to the Crimea If he can be kept there or elsewhere out of
mischief the Russian government will again render the literature of its
own country and of the world as great a service as it has already more
than once rendered in the past by similar means

In the s and s Russian society was seized with a mania for
writing poetry and a countless throng of young poets made their
appearance No book sold so rapidly as a volume of verses But very few
of these aspirants to fame possessed any originality or serious worth
Poetry had advanced not a single step since the days of Nekrsoff and
Shevtchnko so far as national independence was concerned

The most talented of the young poets of this period was Semn
Ykovlevitch Ndson  His grandfather a Jew who had joined
the Russian Church lived in Keff His father a gifted man and a fine
musician died young His mother a Russian gentlewoman died at the age
of thirtyone of consumption At the age of sixteen Ndson fell in
love with a young girl and began to write poetry She died of quick
consumption shortly afterwards This grief affected the young mans
whole career and many of his poems were inspired by it He began to
publish his poems while still in school being already threatened with
pulmonary trouble on account of which he had been sent to the Caucasus
at the expense of the government where he spent a year In  he
graduated from the military school and was appointed an officer in a
regiment stationed at Kronstdt There he lived for two years and some
of his best poems belong to this epoch No Easier Tis for Me to Think
that Thou Art Dead Herostrat Dreams The Brilliant Hall Has
Silent Grown All Hath Come to Pass and so forth He retired from
the military service in  being already in the grasp of consumption
His poems ran through ten editions during the five years which followed
his death and still continue to sell with equal rapidity so remarkable
is their popularity He was an ideally poetical figure moreover he
charms by his flowing musical verse by the enthralling elegance and
grace of his poetical imagery and genuine lyric inspiration All his
poetry is filled with quiet meditative sadness It is by the music of
his verse and the tender tears of his feminine lyrism that Ndson
penetrates the hearts of his readers His masterpiece is My Friend My
Brother and this reflects the sentiment of all his work Here is
the first verse

    My friend my brother weary suffering brother
    Whoever thou mayst be let not thy spirit fail
    Let evil and injustice reign with sway supreme
    Oer all the tearwashed earth
    Let the sacred ideal be shattered and dishonored
    Let innocent blood flow in stream
    Believe me there cometh a time when Baal shall perish
    And love shall return to earth

Another very sincere sympathetic and genuine though not great poet
also of Jewish race is Semn Grigrievitch Frug  the son
of a member of the Jewish agricultural colony in the government of
Khersn He like Ndson believes that good will triumph in the end
and is not in the least a pessimist

Quite the reverse are Nikoli Maxmovitch Vilnkin who is better known
by his pseudonym of Mnsky from his native government and Dmtry
Sergyevitch Merezhkvsky  who as a poet is generally bombastic
His novels are better

There are many other good though not great contemporary writers in
Russia including several women But they hardly come within the scope
of this work which does not aim at being encyclopedic as neither
their work nor their fame is likely to make its way to foreign readers
who are unacquainted with the Russian language For those who do read
Russian there are several good handbooks of contemporary literature
which will furnish all necessary information

FOOTNOTES

 The Old Ritualists or rasklniki are those who do not accept
the corrections to the Church books and so forth made in seventeenth
century by the Patriarch Nkon

 Count L N Tolsty presented me with a copy of one of these
legendsa most distressing and improbable affairwith the remark
Lyeskff has spoiled himself by imitating me He meant that Lyeskff
was imitating his little moral tales and legends to which he had been
devoting himself for some time past I agreed with Tolsty as to the
effect

 Although she was very ill and weak she was good enough to ask me
to visit her a few months before she died in 

 Count L N Tolsty told me that Uspnsky had never been
sufficiently appreciated He also praised Zlatovrtsky highly

 Former crown serfs repeatedly told me how free they had beenhow
much better off than those of private persons

 Naturally it is this feature of his writings which made Count
Tolsty laud him so highly to me

 Or The Golovlffs the above being the more formal translation
Saltykff was too ill to receive strangers when I was in Russia But I
attended a requiem service over his body at his home another at the
Kazn Cathedral where all the literary lights assembled and went to
his funeral in the outlying cemetery thereby having the good fortune to
behold one of the famous demonstrations in which the Russian public
indulges on such occasions

 This refers to the Table of Ranks established by Peter the Great
The fourth class of officials from the top of the ladder have attained
a very respectable amount of embroidery dignity and social position

 About two cents and a half

 I have seen the number variously stated at from eleven to thirteen
but Countess Sopha Andrevna his wife told me there had been fifteen
and I regard her as the final authority on this point a very
interesting one in view of some of his latterday theories and
exhortations Countess Tolsty was the daughter of Dr Behrs of Moscow

 Turgneff who afterwards called Tolsty The Great Writer of the
Russian Land pronounced emphatically against him at this time and so
did many others who became his enthusiastic admirers

 At this period also the peasant costume became the fashion in the
higher circles Count Tolsty is generally out of Russia assumed to be
the first and only wearer of such garments

 This is a particularly interesting example to the people of America
and to me I sent to Count Tolsty over seven thousand dollars which
people throughout the length and breadth of the land had forwarded to me
for that purpose and I turned thousands more in his direction His
conscience is as uneasy and as fitful and illogical in pretty nearly all
other matters which is a pity because it is both lively and sincere
though mistaken

 It was to this sort of story that Count Tolsty referred when he
told me that Lyeskff had spoiled his talent of recent years by
imitating him Tolsty

 I have stated my own theory as to Count Tolstys incessant changes
of view and his puzzling inconsistencies in my Russian Rambles It
is not necessary or fitting that I should repeat it here

 I tried to see him in Nzhni Nvgorod but although he was still
under police surveillance the police could not tell me where to find
him and I obtained the information from a photographer friend of his
Unfortunately he was then in the Crimea gathering material

 Translated into English under the title A Russian Priest Another
volume contains two charming stories from the same circle A Father of
Six and An Occasional Holiday

 He must have been at Kazn about the time I was there and I have
often wondered if I saw him on the wharf where I passed weary hours
waiting for the steamer

 See Orlff and His Wife in my translation 

 I do not attempt a metrical translation Lines    
rhyme in pairs

Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US

keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition
