Note


The poems of this book were written at very various times one Wind
over the Sea I believe even as early as  but the order in which
they are here given is not chronological beyond the fact that the third
part contains only poems written after the outbreak of the war Of these
some were written in England at Oxford in particular some in Wales
and very many during a year in France from November  to December
 which was broken by one leave in the middle of May

The Burial of Sophocles which is here placed at the end was begun
before the war and continued at odd times and in various circumstances
afterwards the final version was sent me from the trenches

Beyond these few facts no prelude and no envoi is needed other than
those here printed as their author left them

If there be one among the Muses nine
Loves not so much Completion as the Will
And less the austere saint than the fond sinner
Loves scanty ruins garlanded with years
Better than lofty palaces entire
To her I dedicate this spoild sheaf
Of rime that scarcely came to harvesting

There is a window here in Magdalen
Composite methinks of fragments that stark Mars
Has scattered Even so my verses be
Composite of memories and halfuttered dreams
Welded together sans due ordinance
Which might have been far other but that Mars
Scattered and harried them with his ruthless flail




I Two Legends



Glastonbury


Thither through moaning woods came Bedivere
At gloomy breaking of a winters day
Weary and travelstained and sick at heart
With a great wound gotten in that last fray
Ere he stood by and watched the King depart
Down the long silent reaches of the mere
And all the earth was sad and skies were drear
And the wind cried and chased the relict leaves
Like ships that the stormtossed ocean batters and heaves
And they fly before the gale and the mariners fear

So he found at the last an hermitage
Hard by a little hill and sheltering trees
That bent gaunt branches in the winters breeze
And he drew rein and leant and struck the door
Then presently came forth an hermit sage
And helped him to dismount with labour sore
Straight went they in but Bedivere being lame
Stumbled against the open door and swooned
And would have fallen but the hermit caught
And laid him gently down then hurrying brought
From a great chest a cordial and came
That he might drink and so beheld his wound

Long time lay Bedivere betwixt life and death
Like a torn traveller on a stormy height
Twixt one wind and another till his breath
Came easier and he prospered Then did sleep
Bathe him in soothing waters soft and deep
And left him whole at breaking of the light
So he beheld the old man and desired
That he would tell of whom he was and whence

Whereat once more the ancient eyes were fired
I I was Arthurs bishop at his court
And in his church I ministered and thence
When at the last the whole was overthrown
With wrath and ill designings straight I sought
A place where I might die too feeble grown
To endure a new beginning to my years
When once the past was lost and whelmed in tears
Hither I came where in the dawns of time
Dim peoples that the very stones forget
Lived loved and fought and wove the riddling rime
On a lake island mystically set
They passed and after ages manifold
Came wandering sainted Joseph even he
That tended Gods frail body and enrolled
In linen clothes of spicd fragrancy
He brought the vessel vanished now from earth
That wrought destruction to the Table Round
Since many deemed themselves above their worth
And sought in vain and perished ere they found

Then Bedivere Alas the King I saw
The unstayed overwhelming tide of war
And when the opposd standards were unfurled
Of Arthur and of Mordred his base son
Ere yet the noise of battle was begun
I heard the heralds crying to the world

Ye that have sought out pallid harmonies
Where never wind blows save the gentle south
Ye that have trafficked on the sounding seas
And fear nor cheerless rains nor scorching drouth

Ye that have piled the rich fullripened crops
Of word and measure till the rime grown proud
Did straight contemn the leaping mountain tops
And lose itself in air and riven cloud

Ye that have lived a dangerous life of war
Whose speech has been bold words and heady boasts
Gather for strife and death unknown before
Come gather all unto the fronting hosts

I saw the last dim battle in the mist
There where a dreary waste of barren sand
Doth mark the ultimate leagues of this fair land
Scarce we beheld the foe we struck or wist
Which party had advantage like thin wraiths
Fit to throng Lethe banks the warriors
Struck and oercame or fell unseen unwept
And alien hopes lives peoples alien faiths
Were all confounded on those desolate shores
And ever the mist seethed and the waves kept
A hollow chanting as they mourned the end
Of all mankind and of created time
How many fell therein of foe or friend
I know not save that when the darkness came
And the mist cleared I found at last the King
His armour and visage fouled with blood and slime
And fading in his eyes the ancient flame

I saw him make on Mordred with his spear
And crying Tide me death betide me life
He shall not live that wrought the accursed thing
Put a dread ending to the outworn strife
I saw them fall together and drawn near
Knew that the King was wounded unto death

Then as he drew with growing pain his breath
I looked and saw a long black barge that stole
Across the waters like a wandering soul
Returnd from the woeful realm to view
The ancient haunts wellloved that once it knew
And when it touched the shallows I did bear
The dying Arthur as he bade and there
I placed him mid dark forms I could not tell
Whose they might be and wept and breathed farewell

Then spake the eremite Beyond yon door
There stands a chapel ancient and weatherworn
And there did worship in the days of yore
The sons of kings The night ere you came hither
I was awakened by the sound of feet
And I looked forth and saw a body borne
By veild figures straight as they knew whither
In at the chapel gateway I went down
And found that they had digged a grave most meet
For one of saintly life or king by birth
They seemed some score and by blown candles light
I saw that each with tears bedewed his gown
Ere sank the corse into the waiting earth
Then prayed and so went out into the night

Thereon the twain arose and went straightway
Toward the old dim chapel and beheld
The stone beneath whose length the body lay
Kneeling they closely scanned it all and spelled
Graven in golden character Arcturus
Rex Quondamque Futurus

                                    Quoth Bedivere
Thank God this voice remaineth unto us
Now I do mind me of a prophecy
Spoken long since in some emblazoned year
How Arthur should escape mortality
And lie beneath the hills in cavern deep
Or on some shore where faery seas do break
Around him all his warriors shall sleep
Who at a great bells sounding shall awake
What time th old enemy spreads death and harm
Thorough his ancient realm and the last woes
Go over her his own victorious arm
Shall rid the stricken land of hate and foes

So leave we them each head inaureoled
With the awakening springs young sunlightgold

Then on an evening hurrying footsteps rung
Without the door and straight twas open flung
They saw who stood therein and each one knew
The face unspared by years and strife and shame
Pale as the moon is pale on winter nights
With deep eyes dreaming like September haze
Or lit with lust of battle eyes that few
Had looked on and forgot in such wise came
Lancelot the hero of immortal fights
Lancelot the golden knight of golden days

Whence camst thou Lancelot Even from the
    Queen
The Queen that was whom now a convents shade
Imprisons and a dark and tristful veil
Enwraps those brows that in old days were seen
Most puissant proud of all that ever made
The traitor honest and the valorous frail

Yet evermore about her form there clings
And evermore shall cling the ancient grace
Like evening sunlight lingering on the mere
And till the end of all created things
There shall be some one found shall strive to trace
The immortal loveliness of Guinevere

Shall I not mind me of old ecstasies
In Camelot beneath the ancient walls
In shady paths and marble terraces
Rosefragrant where eternal sunlight falls
But ah the last long kiss is taen and given
And the last look in those unfathomed eyes
The passionate last embrace is coldly riven
And all is grief beneath the pitiless skies

Gods of the burntout hearth the wandered wind
Gods of pale dawns that vanished long ago
Gods of the barren tree the withered leaf
The faded flower and the ungarnered sheaf
Gods halfforgot in the wild ages flow
Yours yours am I that all for nought have sinned

Spring summer passed away and autumn rain
Swelled the lean brooks until the gelid year
Shot forth its icy hand and grasped again
Again the hanging clouds were struck and furled
By winds of winter until skies were clear
And there was frost o nights and all the world
Lay glistening to the newly risen sun

Till came that season wherein solemn days
Do celebrate the reign on earth begun
Of the most blessd Child whenas all ways
Were bound and all the fields were white with snow
Then in the chapel at high noon they three
Offered their quiet orisons and so
Came forth and looked upon the purity
And when he saw the fields all stainlesswhite
Lancelot groaned in spirit and spake How sore
And no wise joyous to a sinners sight
Is this dear land where the snow lies untrod
Even so once before the eyes of God
My soul lay all unspotted now no more

Courage my son and patience quoth the sage
No sin there is that shall not lose its stain
Through the great love of God and His dear Son
Repent and be forgiven know that none
Shall sue before His throne and sue in vain
Nor shall one name be blotted from the page
If he that bears it turn to prayer and tears

Then Lancelot Though through the tale of years
That still are left before the longedfor earth
Receive my body I should strive amain
To slay myself and gain regenerate birth
Alas it were all profitless and vain
Verily when I came unto this place
I railed on God that I had lost my soul
And nothing gained until a heavenly grace
Enwrapped me like some sick man made half whole
And now my grief is only for old sin
But ah what boots it Lo this barren tree
He touched a shrub that grew beside the door
This tree methinks shall bud and blossom before
I pass the gates divine and enter in
To the fair country I must never see

But even as he spoke the hand of God
Worked on the sombre branches and straightway
They were all green with sap and bud and leaf
As at the very bidding of the spring
Burst forth and soon each tender branch was gay
With flowers that nodded in the winters breeze
So blossomed in old time the prophets rod
And Lancelot stood and saw the wondrous thing

Then softly spake the hermit Now is grief
Reproved and sorrow cast out with the lees
For God beholds the living not the dead
And He that took the semblance of a child
Loves He but penance and the drooping head
Has He not sung for joy has He not smiled

So they grew old together and the years
Pressed no more to their lips the cup of tears
They had drained all maybe And ever less
Seemed all things mortal as in quietness
They pondered the eternal mysteries
The noblest heritage of all men born
Such as are writ upon the face of dawn
Or in the glamour of a moonlit night
Or in the autumn swallows southern flight
Or in the breaking of the restless seas
Or dreamed rich hallowed dreams of aureate days
While yet the King was young and sunlight fell
On bower and roof of ancient Camelot
Of triumph clarion and thanksgiving bell
When all was song and laughter and high praise
Even when as yet the accursed thing was not

Then would loom out from the chill mists of time
The faces and the forms remembered still
The King and Guinevere and Galahad
That rode upon a peerless quest and dire
Kay swift and hasty as a flame of fire
And gentle Percival whom to give made glad
Merlin contriver of the riddling rime
And Gawain silent harbinger of ill

So as the day draws ever toward the dark
Ever toward peace the great winds sounding breath
And ever toward the further shore the bark
They drew to the dark silent realm of death

Far far away from their old palacehalls
Where once they lived a splendid life and vain
That now are scattered stones and crumbled walls
In some soft vale or by the echoing main

Beneath the springing grass and very deep
They three do lie where never mornings rise
To ope the portals of their dazd eyes
Nor ever mortal footstep breaks their sleep

And near beside lies Arthur even he
That was King once and yet again shall be




Legend


Grey ancient abbeys you may see them yet
In that high plain above the western sea
A broken arch or two a few worn stones
Piled one upon another and for paving
Uneven fragments with tall grass between
Grass that is always green winter and summer
The grass that grows on longforgotten graves

It was a springtime morning long ago
A morning of blue skies and whitest clouds
And singing birds and singing streams and woods
That shone like silver yet untouched with green
The brethren of an abbey of the plain
Whereof what now is ruin yet was whole
Were labouring as holy brethren must
Quietly and in peace and elder ones
Paced in the cloister and some older still
Too old to work or dream sat in the sunlight
The sunlight which they soon should see no more

And there came from the wood upon the hill
One clothed in the sere habit of a monk
That passed in at the portal of the abbey
Brighter his face than is the face of spring
And joy was in his tread as in his soul

And some that paced the cloister paused to glance
    at him
And one that went upon an errand stayed
And some that laboured left their work and came
Gathering round him and he spake and said

    Very fair the golden morning
        As in yonder wood I strayed
    And I heard diviner music
        Than the greatest harpers made

    For a sweet bird sang before me
        Songs of laughter and of tears
    All that I have loved and longed for
        As I measured out my years

    Sang of blessed shores and golden
        Where the old dim heroes be
    Distant isles of sunset glory
        Set beyond the western sea

    Sang of Christ and Mary Mother
        Hearkening unto angels seven
    Playing on their golden harpstrings
        In the far courts of high Heaven

So they stood by and listened to his speech
Rhythmic for that great joy was in his soul
But while they wondered whence he was and who
He cast his eyes around and shuddering cried
Who are ye that I thought to be my brothers
Strangers and sons of strangers Where are they
I left behind me but an hour ago
Then was there whispering among the throng
And wonder not a little and some scorn
Till he that spake with anguish in his eye
Cried Take me to a cell that I may pray
Twas done and in the golden afternoon
A brother entered and found none within
Only a sere monks habit and much dust
As of a body crumbled in the grave

And while they wondered what these things might be
At last spake forth the oldest of them all
Burdened with hundred winters in his soul
I can remember when my years were young
Hearing the old monks say one went from here
When spring was on the earth as it is now
Some fivescore years ago and was not seen
Again though search was made in all the land

And some believed this was the same and all
Forgot it in a sennights silent toil
Save one that saw and seeing understood
And for the greater glory of High God
Wrote down the story in a mighty book
And limned the old saint hearkening to the bird
With bright hues and you still may read and see




II First Poems



Rime


O scholar grey with quiet eyes
Reading the charactered pages bright
With one tall candles flickering light
In a turret chamber under the skies
O scholar learned in gramarye
Have you seen the manifold things I see

Have you seen the forms of tracd towers
Whence clamorous voices challenge the hours
Gaunt treebranches pitchy black
Against the long winddriven wrack
Of scurrying shuddering clouds that race
Ever across the pale moons face

Have you heard the tramp of hurrying feet
There beneath in the shadowy street
Have you heard sharp cries and seen the flame
Of silvery steel in a perilous game
A perilous game for men to play
Hid from the searching eyes of day

Have you heard the great awakening breath
Like trump that summons the saints from death
Of the wild majestical wind which blows
Loud and splendid that each man knows
Far O far away is the sea
Breaking murmuring stark and free

All these things I hear and see
I a scholar of gramarye
All are writ in the ancient books
Clear exactly and he that looks
Finds the night and the changing sea
The years gone by and the years to be
He that searches with tireless eyes
In a turretchamber under the skies
Passion and joy and sorrow and laughter
Life and death and the things thereafter




To an Elzevir Cicero


Dustcovered book that very few men know
    Even as very few men understand
    The glory of an ancient storied land
In the wild current of the ages flow
Have not old scholars centuries ago
    Caressed you in the hollow of their hand
    The while with quiet kindly eyes they scanned
Your pages yellowed now then white as snow

A voice there is cries through your every word
Of him that after greatest glory came
    Down the grey road to darkness and to tears
A voice like far seas in still valleys heard
Crying of love and death and hope and fame
    That change not with the changing of the years




To a Drer Drawing of Antwerp Harbour


Figured by Drers magic hand wast thou
    That lightninglike traced on the lucid page
    Rough careless lines with wizardry so sage
That yet the whole was fair I know not how
Ships of gaunt masts and stark seasmitten prow
    Idle yet soon again to sweep the main
    In the swift service of old merchants gain
Where are ye now alas where are ye now
Gone are ye all and vanished very long
    Sunk with great glory in the storied wars
        Or conquered by the leaping breakers wild
And yet we love your image like some song
    That tells of ancient days and high because
        Old Drer looked upon you once and smiled




Pure Virginia


York River Returns


Like smoke that vanishes on the morning breeze
    Are passed the first beginnings of the world
    When time was even as a bud still curled
And scarce the limit set of lands and seas
Like smoke like smoke the composite auguries
    Of Hebrew and of Hellene are all furled
    Fulfilled or else forgot and idly hurled
This way or that way as the great winds please
Aye and like smoke of this delicious herb
    Brought by strange ways the curious mind may guess
        From where the parrot and the leopard be
My thoughts that should be strong the years to curb
    Go up and vanish into nothingness
        On a blue cloud of exquisite fragrancy




A Preface for a Tale I have never told


Herein is nought of windy citadels
Where proud kings dwell that with an iron hand
Deal war or justice here no history
Of valiant ships upon the winedark seas
Passing strange lands and threading channels strait
Between embalmed islands here no song
That men shall sing in battle and remember
When they are old and grey beside the fire
Only a story gathered from the hills
And the wind crying of forgotten days
A story that shall whisper All things change
For friends do grow indifferent and loves
Die like a dream at morning bitterness
Is the sure heritage of all men born
And he alone sees truly who looks out
From some huge aery peak considering not
Fastwalled cities or the works of men
But turns his gaze unto the mountaintops
And the unfathomable blue of heaven
That only change not with the changing years
A tale that shod itself with ancient shoon
And wrapped its cloak and wandered from the west




A Sonnet


There is a wind that takes the heart of a man
    A fresh wind in the latter days of spring
    When hate and war and every evil thing
That the wide arches of high Heaven span
Seems dust and less to be accounted than
    The omened touches of a passing wing
    When Destiny that calls himself a king
    Goes all forgotten for the song of Pan
For why Because the twittering of birds
    Is the best music that was ever sung
Because the voice of trees finds better words
    Than ever poet from his heartstrings wrung
Because all wisdom and all gramarye
Are writ in fields O very plain to see




It was all in the Black Countree


It was all in the Black Countree
What time the sweet o the year should be
I saw a tree all gaunt and grey
As mindful of a winters day
And that a lonely bird did sit
Upon the topmost branch of it
Who to my thought did sweeter sing
Than any minstrel of a king




To a Pianist


When others fingers touch the keys
Then most doleful threnodies
Chase about the air and run
Like Pandmonium begun
Rhythm strained and false accord
In a ceaseless stream are poured
Then sighs are heard and men depart
To seek the sage physicians art
Or silence and a little ease
When others fingers touch the keys

When your fingers touch the keys
Hark soft sounds of summer seas
In a melody most fair
Whisper through the pleasant air
Or a winding mountain stream
Glitters to the pale moonbeam
Or a breeze doth stir the tops
Of springtime larches in a copse
Or the winds are loosed and hurled
About the wonderstricken world
With immortal harmonies
When your fingers touch the keys




A Fragment


                                  

And some came down in a great wind
    Under grey scurrying skies
To where the long wavebeaten shore
    For ever shrieks and cries

O fling aside your toil your care
    When one cries of the sea
And the great waves that foam and toss
    And the white clouds that flee
Let us forget our weariness
    Forget that we have sinned
So we but sail what matters it
    If Death ride on the wind

Storm from the sky storm from the sea
    Beat on them as they stood
And a great longing sprang in them
    To cross the roaring flood   




Sea Poppies


Twixt lonely lands and desert beach
Where no wind blows and no waves reach
A sunken precinct here we keep
With woven wiles of endless sleep
Our twisted stems of serehued green
Our pallid blooms what sun has seen
And he that tastes our magic breath
Shall sleep that sleep whose name is death

Wild clouds are scurrying overhead
The wild winds voice is loud and dread
Sounding the knell of the dying day
Yet here is silence and gloom alway
And a great longing seizes me
To burst my bondage and be free
To look on winds and waters strife
And breathe in my nostrils the breath of life
Give me not dim and slumbrous ease
But sounding storm and labouring seas
Not peaceful and untroubled years
But toil and warfare and passion and tears
And I would fall in valorous fight
And lie on lofty farseen height

Yet how to burst these prisonbands
Forged by unseen spirithands

O seek not to burst our prison bands
Forged by unseen spirithands
Clashing battle and labouring sea
    These be for others not for thee
Thou lover of storm and passion and war
Breakst our charmed circle never more




O sing me a Song of the Wild West Wind


O sing me a song of the wild west wind
    And his great seaharrying flail
Of hardy mariners copper skinned
    That fly with a bursting sail
They see the clouds of crispd white
    That shadow the distant hills
And filled are they with a strange delight
    As shaking away old ills

O give me a boat that is sure and stark
    And swift as a slingers stone
With a sail of canvas bronzd dark
    And I will go out alone
Nor fear nor sorrow my soul shall keep
    When around me lies the sea
And I will return with the night and sleep
    In the winds wild harmony




re Perennius


Written on Commemoration Sunday Corpus Christi College Oxford


We praise we praise the immortal dead
    Who strove beneath unheeding skies
For truth that raised the drooping head
    For light that gladdened weary eyes

The martyrs cross the warriors sword
    How should they be of lesser worth
Than some unprofitable hoard
    In ancient mines below the earth

The song that one alone has sung
    The great uncompromising page
Are these but glittering baubles flung
    About the world from age to age

But ruind columns wondrous tall
    Built in old time with labour sore
The mighty deeds done once for all
    The voice heard once and heard no more

Rather they shine as doth the star
    About the close of winters day
That cheers the traveller afar
    And draws him on and points the way

                                  

We praise we praise the immortal dead
    Do they not verily wait till we
Of the spoilt years unharvested
    Be also of their company




The Old Kings


Far away from sunny rills
Far away from golden broom
Far away from any town
Whither merchants travel down
In a hollow of the hills
In impenetrable gloom
Sit the old forgotten kings
Unto whom no poet sings
Unto whom none makes bequest
Unto whom no kingdoms rest
Only wayward shreds of dreams
And the sound of ancient streams
And the shock of ancient strife
On the further shore of life

                                  

When our days are done shall we
Enter their pale company




O there be Kings whose Treasuries


O there be kings whose treasuries
    Are rich with pearls and gold
And silks and bales of cramasy
    And spices manifold
Gardens they have with marble stairs
    And streams than life more fair
With roses set and lavender
    That do enchant the air

O there be many ships that sail
    The seaways wide and blue
And there be mastermariners
    To sail them straight and true
And there be many women fair
    Who watch out anxiously
And are enamoured of the day
    Their dear ones come from sea

But riches I can find enow
    All in a barren land
Where sombre lakes shine wondrously
    With rocks on either hand
And I can find enow of love
    Up there alone alone
With none beside me save the wind
    Nor speech except his moan

For there far up among the hills
    The great storms come and go
In a most proud processional
    Of cloud and rain and snow
There light and darkness only are
    A changing benison
Of the old gods who wrought the world
    And shaped the moon and sun




A Study


In chamber hung with white
Lit by the dawning light

Upon a slender bed
She lies as she were dead

Most carvenivory fair
And palely gold her hair

Lo the suns yellow ray
That with the rise of day

Through quartered casement came
To wake her lifes pale flame




The Eremite


When the world is still in the hush of dawn
And yet fast sleeping are hate and scorn
From my grey lodging under the hill
I do go out and wander at will

Of nights when the riven clouds are hurled
And strife and rancour possess the world
I sit alone with thoughts that are chill
In my grey lodging under the hill




The House of Eld


Now the old winds are wild about the house
    And the old ghosts cry to me from the air
Of a far isle set in the western sea
    And of the evening sunlight lingering there

Ah I am bound here bound and fettered
    The dark house crumbles and the woods decay
I was too fain of life that bound me here
    Away old longloved ghosts away away




The Southwest Wind


The southwest wind has blown his fill
    And vanished with departing day
The air is warm and very still
    And soft as silks of far Cathay

This is a night when spirits stray
    Their wan limbs bear them where they will
They wring their pallid hands alway
    Seeing the lights upon the hill




Schumann Erstes Verlust


O dreary fall the leaves
The withered leaves
Among the trees
Complains the breeze
That still bereaves

All silent lies the mere
The silver mere
In saddest wise
Reflecting skies
Forlorn and sere

Would autumn had not claimed its own
And would the swallows had not flown

Skies overcast
Leaves falling fast
And she has passed
And left the woodland strown
The woodland strown
The silver mere
The dying year
And me alone

Skies overcast
Leaves falling fast
Does she that passed
Dream of the woodland strown
The woodland strown
The silver mere
The dying year
And me alone




Dark Boughs against a Golden Sky


Dark boughs against a golden sky
    And crying of the winter wind
And sweet it is for hope is high
    And sad it is for we have sinned

Perfect is natures every part
    In sunny rest or windy strife
But never yet the perfect heart
    And never yet the perfect life

Dark boughs against a golden sky
    And crying of the winter wind
And in the cold earth we must lie
    What matter then if we have sinned

For evermore and evermore
    Shall the great river onward roll
And ever winding streams and poor
    Shall lose them in the mighty whole




Wind of the Darkness


Wind of the darkness breathing round us
    Wind from the neverresting sea
Lo you have loosed the cords that bound us
    Lo you have set our spirits free

Free to take wings like the seabird lonely
    Beating hardily up the wind
Fixed are his eyes on the waters only
    Never a glance for the land behind

Wind of the darkness breathing round us
    Wind from the neverresting sea
Was it the old gods voice that found us
    Here where the bars of prison be

From the far isle that neither knoweth
    Change of season nor times increase
Where is plenty and no man soweth
    Calling to strife that shall end in peace




Creator Spiritus


The wind that scatters dying leaves
    And whirls them from the autumn tree
Is grateful to the ship that cleaves
    With stately prow the scurrying sea

Heedless about the world we play
    Like children in a garden close
A postern bars the outward way
    And whats beyond it no man knows

For careless days a life at will
    A little laughter and some tears
These are sufficiency to fill
    The early vain untroubled years

Till at the last the wind upheaves
    His unimagined strength and we
Are scattered far like autumn leaves
    Or proudly sail like ships at sea




Wind over the Sea


    Only a grey sea and a long grey shore
    And the grey heavens brooding over them
    Twilight of hopes and purposes forgot
    Twilight of ceaseless eld and when was youth
    Is it not lonely here beyond the years

Out of the gathering darkness crashes a wind from the
    ocean
Rushing with leaguelong paces over the plain of the
    waters
Driving the clouds and the breakers before it in sudden
    commotion

Who are these on the wind riders and riderless horses
Riders the great ones that have been and are and those
    to come shall be
These are the children of might lifes champions and
    historys forces

Might I but grasp at a bridle and fear not to be trodden
    under
Swing myself into a saddle and ride on greatly exulting
On down the long straight road of the wind a galloping
    thunder

    Only a grey sea and a long grey shore
    And the grey heavens brooding over them
    Twilight of hopes and purposes forgot
    Twilight of ceaseless eld for when was youth
    Is it not lonely here beyond the years




Songs on the Downs





This is the road the Romans made
    This track half lost in the green hills
Or fading in a forestglade
    Mid violets and daffodils

The years have fallen like dead leaves
    Unwept uncounted and unstayed
Such as the autumn tempest thieves
    Since first this road the Romans made





A miser lives within this house
His patron saints the gnawing mouse
And theres no peace upon his brows

A many ancient trees and thin
Do fold the place their shade within
And moan as for remembered sin




III Last Poems and The Burial of Sophocles



We who have bowed ourselves to Time


We who have bowed ourselves to time
Now arm an uneventful rime
    With panoply of flowers
    Through the long summer hours   

But now our fierce and warlike Muse
Doth soft companionship refuse
    And we must mount and ride
    Upon a steed untried   

We who have led by gradual ways
Our placid life to sterner days
    And for old quiet things
    Have set the strife of kings

Who battled have with bloody hands
Through evil times in barren lands
    To whom the voice of guns
    Speaks and no longer stuns

Calm though with death encompassd
That watch the hours go overhead
    Knowing too well we must
    With all men come to dust   

Crave of our masters clemency
Silence a little space that we
    Upon their ear may force
    Tales of our trodden course




Anglia Valida in Senectute


On the Declaration of War


Not like to those who find untrodden ways
    But down the weary paths we know
Through every change of sky and change of days
    Silent processional we go

Not unto us the soft unlaboured breath
    Of childrens hopes and childrens fears
We are not sworn to battle to the death
    With all the wrongs of all the years

We are old we are old and worn and schoold with ills
    Maybe our road is almost done
Maybe we are drawn near unto the hills
    Where rest is and the setting sun

But yet a pride is ours that will not brook
    The taunts of fools too saucy grown
He that is rash to prove it let him look
    He kindle not a fire unknown

Since first we flung our gauntlet to the skies
    And dared the high Gods will to bend
A fire that still may burn deceit and lies
    Burn and consume them to the end




Dark is the World our Fathers left us


Dark is the world our fathers left us
    Wearily greyly the long years flow
Almost the gloom has of hope bereft us
    Far is the high gods song and low

Sombre the crests of the mountains lonely
    Leafless windridden moan the trees
Down in the valleys is twilight only
    Twilight over the mourning seas

Time was when earth was always golden
    Time was when skies were always clear
Spirits and souls of the heroes olden
    Faint are cries from the darkness hear

Tear ye the veil of time asunder
    Tear the veil tis the gods command
Hear we the sunstricken breakers thunder
    Over the shore where the heroes stand

                                  

Dark is the world our fathers left us
    Heavily greyly the long years flow
Almost the gloom has of hope bereft us
    Far is the high gods song and low




Awakening


Goldcrested towers against the veild skies
Sere branches of the winter trees beneath
And a low song and heavylidded eyes

Is there aught else in all the world beside
Is not time stilled and ended in this hour

                                  

Up and away the belted squadrons ride




Ave atque Vale


In Oxford evermore the same
    Unto the uttermost verge of time
Though gravedust choke the sons of men
    And silence wait upon the rime

At evening now the skies set forth
    Last glories of the dying year
The wind gives chase to relict leaves
    And we we may not linger here

A little while and we are gone
    God knows if it be ours to see
Again the earliest hoarfrost white
    On the long lawns of Trinity

In Merton of the many courts
    And doorways good to wander through
Gable and spire shall glitter white
    Or tawny gold against the blue

And still the winter sun shall smile
    At noonday or at sunset hour
On Magdalen girt with ancient trees
    Beneath her bright immortal tower

Though nevermore we tread the ways
    That our returning feet have known
Past Oriel and Christ Church gate
    Unto those dearer walls our own

                                  

Oxford is evermore the same
    Unto the uttermost verge of time
Though gravedust choke the sons of men
    And silence wait upon the rime




O one came down from Seven Hills


O one came down from seven hills
    And crossd seven streams
All in his hands were thyme and grass
    And in his eyes were dreams
He passd by a seven fields
    With early dews all grey
And entered in the stricken town
    About the break of day

O you old men that stand and talk
    About the marketplace
There is much trouble in your eyes
    And anguish in your face
O woman in a silent room
    Within a silent house
There is no pleasure in your voice
    Or peace upon your brows

O how should such as we rejoice
    Who weep that others die
Who quake and curse ourselves and watch
    The vengeful hours go by
O better far to fly the grief
    That wounds and never kills
O better far to fly the town
    And seek the seven hills

I will go pray the seven gods
    Who keep the seven hills
That they do grant your city peace
    And easement of her ills
Nay rather pray the seven gods
    To launch the latest pain
For there be many things to do
    Ere we see peace again

Then Ill go praise the seven gods
    With hymns and chauntings seven
Such as shall split the mountaintops
    And shrivel up blue heaven
That there be men who mock at threats
    And wag their heads at strife
Love home above their own hearts blood
    And honour more than life




Sonnet to the British Navy


Lest force aspire to brand an alien name
    Upon the immortal empire of the free
Lest fire and sword and slaughter strive to tame
    This isle was neer so tamed and neer shall be
Ye guard the ocean barrier undismayed
    Midst hidden perils for a brave mans fears
In iron craft that many smiths have made
    With peaceful labour in the old dead years
In a small vessel of one Smith illwrought
    I must soon venture on another deep
And dare with little hope and little thought
    Of praise and honour and untroubled sleep
So as each sails upon his perilous sea
    I pray High God He strengthen you and me




The Last Meeting


We who are young and have caught the splendour of
        life
    Hunting it down the forested ways of the world
Do we not wear our hearts like a banner unfurled
    Crowned with a chaplet of love shod with the sandals
        of strife

Now not a lustre of pain nor an ocean of tears
    Nor pangs of death nor any other thing
That the old tristful gods on our heads may bring
    Can rob us of this one hour in the midst of the years




The New Age and the Old


Like the small source of a smoothflowing river
    Like the pale dawn of a wonderful day
Comes the New Age from High God the good giver
    Comes with the shouts of the children at play

As an old leaf whirls faster and faster
    From the sere branch that once gave it fair birth
Into the arms of the devil its master
    Be the old age swept away from the earth




To the Cultured


Sons of culture Godgiven
First offspring of Heaven
Athletic and tanned
Wellbuilt and not nervous
With your golf and your tweeds
And your noble editions
Quiet lives and few needs
Say a thousand a year
For your earthly career
Who cant understand
Discontent and seditions
May Heaven preserve us
From being like you

What are we what am I
Poor rough creatures whose life
Is depressing and grey
Is a heartbreaking strife
With death and with shame
And your polite laughter
Tillthe world pass away
In smoke and in flame
And some of us die
And some live on after
To build it anew




Afterwards


Afterwards when
The old Gods hate
On the riven earth
No more is poured

When weapons of war
Are all outworn
What shall become
Of the race of men

One shall go forth
In the likeness of a child
Under sere skies
Of a grey dawning

One shall go forth
In the likeness of a child
And desolate places
Shall spring and blossom

One shall go forth
In the likeness of a child
And men shall sing
And greatly rejoice

All men shall sing
For the love that is in them
And he shall behold it
And sing also




Domum redit Poeta


O much desired from far away
    And long I hold thee once again
Thou undiminished treasury
    Of small delights yet nowise vain

The cat curled on the cosy hearth
    The thrushes in the garden trees
The memories of younger years
    The quiet voices and the peace




Memories


Shapes in the mist it is long since I saw you
    Pale hands and faces and quiet eyes
Crowned with a garland the dead years wrought you
    Out of remembrance that never dies

One among you is tall and supple
    Good to fight or to love beside
Only the stain of a deadly quarrel
    Only that and the years divide

One there is with a face as honest
    Heart as true as the open sea
One who never betrayed a comrade
    Death stands now betwixt him and me

One I loved with a passionate longing
    Born of worship and fierce despair
Dreamed that Heaven were only happy
    If at length I should find him there

Shapes in the mist ye see me lonely
    Lonely and sad in the dim firelight
How far now to the last of all battles
    Listen the guns are loud tonight

Whatever comes I will strike once surely
    Once because of an ancient tryst
Once for love of your dear dead faces
    Ere I come unto you Shapes in the mist




Intercessional


There is a place where voices
    Of great guns do not come
Where rifle mine and mortar
    For evermore are dumb
Where there is only silence
    And peace eternal and rest
Set somewhere in the quiet isles
    Beyond Deaths starry West

O God the God of battles
    To us who intercede
Give only strength to follow
    Until theres no more need
And grant us at that ending
    Of the unkindly quest
To come unto the quiet isles
    Beyond Deaths starry West




April 


Now spring is come upon the hills in France
And all the trees are delicately fair
As heeding not the great guns voice by chance
Brought down the valley on a wandering air
Now day by day upon the uplands bare
Do gentle toiling horses draw the plough
And birds sing often in the orchards where
Spring wantons it with blossoms on her brow
Aye but there is no peace in England now

O little isle amid unquiet seas
Though grisly messengers knock on many doors
Though there be many storms among your trees
And all your banners rent with ancient wars
Yet such a grace and majesty are yours
There be still some whose glad heart suffereth
All hate can bring from her misgotten stores
Telling themselves so Englands self draw breath
Thats all the happiness on this side death




Over the Hills and Hollows Green


Over the hills and hollows green
    The springtide air goes valiantly
Where many sainted singing larks
    And blessed primaveras be

But bitterly the springtide air
    Over the desert towns doth blow
About whose torn and shattered streets
    No more shall childrens footsteps go




Sonnet


Tonight the world is but a prison house
And kindly ways and all the springing grass
Are dungeon stones to him that may not pass
Among them save with anguish on his brows
And any wretched husbandman that ploughs
The upland acres in his habit spare
Is king to those in palaces of glass
Who sit with grief and weariness for spouse

O God who madest first the world that we
Might happy live and praise its pleasantness
In such wise as the angels never could
Wherefore are hearts fashioned so wondrously
All spoiled and changed by human bitterness
Into the likenesses of stone and wood




O Long the Fiends of War shall dance


O long the fiends of war shall dance
Upon the stricken fields of France
And long and long their grisly cry
Shall echo up and smite the sky
O long and long the tears of God
Shall fall upon a barren sod
Save when of His great clemency
He gives mens hearts in custody
Of grim old kindly Death who knows
The mould is better than the rose




For R Q G


July 


O God whose great inscrutable purposes
Seen only of the one allseeing eye
Are as unchangeable as the azure sky
And as fulfilled of infinite mysteries
Are like a fastlocked castle without keys
Whereof the gates are very strong and high
Impenetrable and we poor fools die
Nor even know what thing beyond them is
O God by whom mens lives are multiplied
    Are scattered broadcast in the world like grain
        And after long time reaped again and stored
O Thou who only canst be glorified
    By mans own passion and the supreme pain
        Accept this sacrifice of blood outpoured




Sun and Shadow and Winds of Spring


Sun and shadow and winds of spring
    Love and laughter and hope and fame
Cloud and stormlight over the hills
    Tears and passion and sordid shame

All all are but as quenchd fire
    And vanishd smoke to him that lies
Amid the silence of the trees
    Under the silence of the skies




Let us tell Quiet Stories of Kind Eyes


Let us tell quiet stories of kind eyes
    And placid brows where peace and learning sate
Of misty gardens under evening skies
    Where four would walk of old with steps sedate

Lets have no word of all the sweat and blood
    Of all the noise and strife and dust and smoke
We who have seen Death surging like a flood
      Wave upon wave that leaped and raced and broke

Or lets sit silently we three together
    Around a wide hearthfire thats glowing red
Giving no thought to all the stormy weather
    That flies above the rooftree overhead

And he the fourth that lies all silently
    In some fardistant and untended grave
Under the shadow of a shattered tree
    Shall leave the company of the hapless brave

And draw nigh unto us for memorys sake
    Because a look a word a deed a friend
Are bound with cords that never a man may break
    Unto his heart for ever until the end




Save that Poetic Fire


Save that poetic fire
    Burns in the hidden heart
Save that the fullvoiced choir
    Sings in a place apart

Man thats of woman born
    With all his imaginings
Were less than the dew of morn
    Less than the least of things




The Burial of Sophocles


The First Verses


Gather great store of roses crimsonred
    From ancient gardens under summer skies
New opened buds and some that soon must shed
    Their leaves to earth that all expectant lies
Some from the paths of poets wandering
    Some from the places where young lovers meet
Some from the seats of dreamers pondering
    And all most richly red and honeysweet

For in the splendour of the afternoon
    When sunshine lingers on the glittering town
And glorifies the temples wondroushewn
    All set about it like a deathless crown
We will go mingle with the solemn throng
    With neither eyes that weep nor hearts that bleed
That to his grave with slow majestic song
    Bears down the latest of the godlike seed

Many a singer lies on distant isle
    Beneath the canopy of changing sky
Around them waves innumerable smile
    And oer their head the restless seabirds cry
But we will lay him far from sound of seas
    Far from the jutting crags unhopeful gloom
Where there blows never wind save summer breeze
    And where the growing rose may clasp his tomb

And thither in the splendid nights of spring
    When stars in legions over heaven are flung
Shall come the ancient gods all wondering
    Why he sings not that had so richly sung
There Heracles with peaceful foot shall press
    The springing herbage and Hephstus strong
Hera and Aphrodites loveliness
    And the great giver of the choric song

And thither after weary pilgrimage
    From unknown lands beyond the hoary wave
Shall travellers through every coming age
    Approach to pluck a blossom from his grave
Some in the flush of youth or in the prime
    Whose life is still as heapd gold to spend
And some who have drunk deep of grief and time
    And who yet linger halfafraid the end


The Interlude


It was upon a night of spring
Even the time when first do sing
The newreturnd nightingales
Whenas all hills and woods and dales
Are resonant with melody
Of songs that die not but shall be
Unto the latest hour of time
Beyond the life of word or rime
Whenas all brooks more softly flow
Remembering lovers long ago
That stood upon their banks and vowed
And love was with them like a cloud
There came one out of Athens town
In a spun robe with sandals brown
Just when the white ship of the moon
Had first set sail and many a rune
Was written in the argent stars
His feet were set towards the hills
Because he knew that there the rills
Ran down like jewels and fairy cars
Galloped maybe among the dells
And airy sprites wove fitful spells
Of gossamer and cold moonshine
Which do most mistily entwine
And ever the hills called and a voice
Cried Soon maybe comes thy choice
Twixt mortal immortality
Such as shall never be again
Twixt the most passionatepleasant pain
And all the quiet barren joys
That old men prate about to boys

                                  

He wandered many nights and days
Whose morns were always crystal clear
As lay the world in still amaze
Enchanted of the springing year
And all the nights with wakeful eyes
Watched for another dawn to rise
Till at the last the mountain tops
Received him which like giant props
Stand lest the allencircling sky
Fall down and men be crushed and die
And so he reached a curvd hill
Whereon the hornd moon did seem
Her richest radiance to spill
In an inestimable stream
Like jewels rare of countless price
Or wizard magic turned to ice

                                  

And as he reached the topmost crest of it
Lo the Olympian majesties did sit
In a most high and passionless conclave
They ate ambrosia with their deathless lips
And ever and anon the golden wave
Flowed of the drink divine which only strips
This mortal frame of its mortality
And there and there was Aphrodite she
That is more lovely than the golden dawn
And from a ripple of the sea was born
And there was Hera the imperious queen
And Dians chastity that hunts unseen
What time with spring the woodland boughs are green
And there was Pan with mirth and pleasantness
And Eros self that never knew distress
Save for the love of the fair Cretan maid
There Hermes with the wings of speed arrayed
And awful Zeus the king of gods and men
And ever at his feet Apollo sang
A measure of changing harmonies that rang
From that high mountain over all the world
And all the sails of fighting ships were furled
And men drew breath and there was peace again
But him that saw the sight like flame
Or depths of waters overcame
He swooned nor heard how ceased the choir
Of strings upon Apollos lyre
Nor saw he how the sweet god stood
And smiled on him in kindly mood
And stooped and kissed him as he lay
Then lightly rose and turned away
To join the bright immortal throng
And make for them another song


The Last Verses


O ageless nonpareil of stars
    That shinest through a mist of cloud
O light beyond the prison bars
    Remote unwavering and proud
Fortunate star and happy light
Ye benison the gloom of night

All hail unfailing eye and hand
    All hail all hail unsilenced voice
That makest dead men understand
    The very dead in graves rejoice
Whose utterance writ in ancient books
Shall always live for him that looks

Many as leaves from autumn trees
    The years shall flutter from on high
And with their multiple decease
    The souls of men shall fall and die
Yet while the empires turn to dust
You shall live on because you must

O seven times happy he that dies
    After the splendid harvesttide
When strong barns shield from winter skies
    The grain thats rightly stored inside
There death shall scatter no more tears
Than oer the falling of the years

Aye happy seven times is he
    Who enters not the silent doors
Before his time but tenderly
    Death beckons unto him because
Theres rest within for weary feet
Now all the journey is complete




So we lay down the Pen


So we lay down the pen
So we forbear the building of the rime
And bid our hearts be steel for times and a time
    Till ends the strife and then
When the New Age is verily begun
God grant that we may do the things undone

Section  General Information About Project Gutenberg electronic
works


Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the US unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBooks eBook
number often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII
compressed zipped HTML and others

Corrected editions of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number The replaced older file is renamed
Versions based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility

    httpwwwgutenbergorg

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg including
how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to subscribe to
our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks
