CHAPTER I

All ready Miss Welse though Im sorry we cant spare one of the
steamers boats

Frona Welse arose with alacrity and came to the first officers side

Were so busy he explained and goldrushers are such perishable
freight at least

I understand she interrupted and I too am behaving as though I
were perishable  And I am sorry for the trouble I am giving you
butbut  She turned quickly and pointed to the shore  Do you
see that big loghouse  Between the clump of pines and the river  I
was born there

Guess Id be in a hurry myself he muttered sympathetically as he
piloted her along the crowded deck

Everybody was in everybody elses way nor was there one who failed to
proclaim it at the top of his lungs  A thousand goldseekers were
clamoring for the immediate landing of their outfits  Each hatchway
gaped wide open and from the lower depths the shrieking donkeyengines
were hurrying the misassorted outfits skyward  On either side of the
steamer rows of scows received the flying cargo and on each of these
scows a sweating mob of men charged the descending slings and heaved
bales and boxes about in frantic search  Men waved shipping receipts
and shouted over the steamerrails to them  Sometimes two and three
identified the same article and war arose  The twocircle and the
circleanddot brands caused endless jangling while every whipsaw
discovered a dozen claimants

The purser insists that he is going mad the first officer said as
he helped Frona Welse down the gangway to the landing stage and the
freight clerks have turned the cargo over to the passengers and quit
work  But were not so unlucky as the Star of Bethlehem he reassured
her pointing to a steamship at anchor a quarter of a mile away  Half
of her passengers have packhorses for Skaguay and White Pass and the
other half are bound over the Chilcoot  So theyve mutinied and
everythings at a standstill

Hey you he cried beckoning to a Whitehall which hovered discreetly
on the outer rim of the floating confusion

A tiny launch pulling heroically at a huge towbarge attempted to
pass between but the boatman shot nervily across her bow and just as
he was clear unfortunately caught a crab  This slewed the boat
around and brought it to a stop

Watch out the first officer shouted

A pair of seventyfoot canoes loaded with outfits goldrushers and
Indians and under full sail drove down from the counter direction
One of them veered sharply towards the landing stage but the other
pinched the Whitehall against the barge  The boatman had unshipped his
oars in time but his small craft groaned under the pressure and
threatened to collapse  Whereat he came to his feet and in short
nervous phrases consigned all canoemen and launchcaptains to eternal
perdition  A man on the barge leaned over from above and baptized him
with crisp and crackling oaths while the whites and Indians in the
canoe laughed derisively

Aw gwan one of them shouted  Why dont yeh learn to row

The boatmans fist landed on the point of his critics jaw and dropped
him stunned upon the heaped merchandise  Not content with this summary
act he proceeded to follow his fist into the other craft  The miner
nearest him tugged vigorously at a revolver which had jammed in its
shiny leather holster while his brother argonauts laughing waited
the outcome  But the canoe was under way again and the Indian
helmsman drove the point of his paddle into the boatmans chest and
hurled him backward into the bottom of the Whitehall

When the flood of oaths and blasphemy was at full tide and violent
assault and quick death seemed most imminent the first officer had
stolen a glance at the girl by his side  He had expected to find a
shocked and frightened maiden countenance and was not at all prepared
for the flushed and deeply interested face which met his eyes

I am sorry he began

But she broke in as though annoyed by the interruption No no not
at all  I am enjoying it every bit  Though I am glad that mans
revolver stuck  If it had not

We might have been delayed in getting ashore The first officer
laughed and therein displayed his tact

That man is a robber he went on indicating the boatman who had now
shoved his oars into the water and was pulling alongside  He agreed
to charge only twenty dollars for putting you ashore  Said hed have
made it twentyfive had it been a man  Hes a pirate mark me and he
will surely hang some day  Twenty dollars for a halfhours work
Think of it

Easy sport  Easy cautioned the fellow in question at the same
time making an awkward landing and dropping one of his oars overside
Youve no call to be flingin names about he added defiantly
wringing out his shirtsleeve wet from rescue of the oar

Youve got good ears my man began the first officer

And a quick fist the other snapped in

And a ready tongue

Need it in my business  No gettin long without it among you
seasharks  Pirate am I  And you with a thousand passengers packed
like sardines  Charge em double firstclass passage feed em
steerage grub and bunk em worse n pigs  Pirate eh  Me

A redfaced man thrust his head over the rail above and began to bellow
lustily

I want my stock landed  Come up here Mr Thurston  Now  Right
away  Fifty cayuses of  mine eating their heads off in this dirty
kennel of yours and itll be a sick time youll have if you dont
hustle them ashore as fast as Godll let you  Im losing a thousand
dollars a day and I wont stand it  Do you hear  I wont stand it
Youve robbed me right and left from the time you cleared dock in
Seattle and by the hinges of hell I wont stand it any more  Ill
break this company as sure as my names Thad Ferguson  Dye hear my
spiel  Im Thad Ferguson and you cant come and see me any too quick
for your health  Dye hear

Pirate eh the boatman soliloquized  Who  Me

Mr Thurston waved his hand appeasingly at the redfaced man and
turned to the girl  Id like to go ashore with you and as far as the
store but you see how busy we are  Goodby and a lucky trip to you
Ill tell off a couple of men at once and break out your baggage  Have
it up at the store tomorrow morning sharp

She took his hand lightly and stepped aboard  Her weight gave the
leaky boat a sudden lurch and the water hurtled across the bottom
boards to her shoetops but she took it coolly enough settling
herself in the sternsheets and tucking her feet under her

Hold on the officer cried  This will never do Miss Welse  Come
on back and Ill get one of our boats over as soon as I can

Ill see you inin heaven first retorted the boatman shoving off
Let go he threatened

Mr Thurston gripped tight hold of the gunwale and as reward for his
chivalry had his knuckles rapped sharply by the oarblade  Then he
forgot himself and Miss Welse also and swore and swore fervently

I dare say our farewell might have been more dignified she called
back to him her laughter rippling across the water

Jove he muttered doffing his cap gallantly  There is a woman
And a sudden hunger seized him and a yearning to see himself mirrored
always in the gray eyes of Frona Welse  He was not analytical he did
not know why but he knew that with her he could travel to the end of
the earth  He felt a distaste for his profession and a temptation to
throw it all over and strike out for the Klondike whither she was
going then he glanced up the beetling side of the ship saw the red
face of Thad Ferguson and forgot the dream he had for an instant
dreamed


Splash  A handful of water from his strenuous oar struck her full in
the face  Hope you dont mind it miss he apologized  Im doin
the best I know how which aint much

So it seems she answered goodnaturedly

Not that I love the sea bitterly but Ive got to turn a few honest
dollars somehow and this seemed the likeliest way  I oughter a ben
in Klondike by now if Id had any luck at all  Tell you how it was
I lost my outfit on Windy Arm halfway in after packin it clean
across the Pass

Zip  Splash  She shook the water from her eyes squirming the while
as some of it ran down her warm back

Youll do he encouraged her  Youre the right stuff for this
country  Goin all the way in

She nodded cheerfully

Then youll do  But as I was sayin after I lost my outfit I hit
back for the coast bein broke to hustle up another one  Thats why
Im chargin highpressure rates  And I hope you dont feel sore at
what I made you pay  Im no worse than the rest miss sure  I had to
dig up a hundred for this old tub which aint worth ten down in the
States  Same kind of prices everywhere  Over on the Skaguay Trail
horseshoe nails is just as good as a quarter any day  A man goes up to
the bar and calls for a whiskey  Whiskeys half a dollar  Well he
drinks his whiskey plunks down two horseshoe nails and its OK  No
kick comin on horseshoe nails  They use em to make change

You must be a brave man to venture into the country again after such
an experience  Wont you tell me your name  We may meet on the
Inside

Who  Me  Oh Im Del Bishop pocketminer and if ever we run across
each other remember Id give you the last shirtI mean remember my
last bit of grub is yours

Thank you she answered with a sweet smile for she was a woman who
loved the things which rose straight from the heart

He stopped rowing long enough to fish about in the water around his
feet for an old cornbeef can

Youd better do some bailin he ordered tossing her the can
Shes leakin worse since that squeeze

Frona smiled mentally tucked up her skirts and bent to the work  At
every dip like great billows heaving along the skyline the
glacierfretted mountains rose and fell  Sometimes she rested her back
and watched the teeming beach towards which they were heading and
again the landlocked arm of the sea in which a score or so of great
steamships lay at anchor  From each of these to the shore and back
again flowed a steady stream of scows launches canoes and all sorts
of smaller craft  Man the mighty toiler reacting upon a hostile
environment she thought going back in memory to the masters whose
wisdom she had shared in lectureroom and midnight study  She was a
ripened child of the age and fairly understood the physical world and
the workings thereof  And she had a love for the world and a deep
respect

For some time Del Bishop had only punctuated the silence with splashes
from his oars but a thought struck him

You havent told me your name he suggested with complacent delicacy

My name is Welse she answered  Frona Welse

A great awe manifested itself in his face and grew to a greater and
greater awe  YouareFronaWelse he enunciated slowly  Jacob
Welse aint your old man is he

Yes I am Jacob Welses daughter at your service

He puckered his lips in a long low whistle of understanding and stopped
rowing  Just you climb back into the stern and take your feet out of
that water he commanded  And gimme holt that can

Am I not bailing satisfactorily she demanded indignantly

Yep  Youre doin all right but but you areare

Just what I was before you knew who I was  Now you go on
rowingthats your share of the work and Ill take care of mine

Oh youll do he murmured ecstatically bending afresh to the oars
And Jacob Welse is your old man  I oughter a known it sure

When they reached the sandspit crowded with heterogeneous piles of
merchandise and buzzing with men she stopped long enough to shake
hands with her ferryman  And though such a proceeding on the part of
his feminine patrons was certainly unusual Del Bishop squared it
easily with the fact that she was Jacob Welses daughter

Remember my last bit of grub is yours he reassured her still
holding her hand

And your last shirt too dont forget

Well youre aaa crackerjack he exploded with a final squeeze
Sure

Her short skirt did not block the free movement of her limbs and she
discovered with pleasurable surprise that the quick tripping step of
the city pavement had departed from her and that she was swinging off
in the long easy stride which is born of the trail and which comes only
after much travail and endeavor  More than one goldrusher shooting
keen glances at her ankles and graygaitered calves affirmed Del
Bishops judgment  And more than one glanced up at her face and
glanced again for her gaze was frank with the frankness of
comradeship and in her eyes there was always a smiling light just
trembling on the verge of dawn and did the onlooker smile her eyes
smiled also  And the smiling light was proteanmoodedmerry
sympathetic joyous quizzicalthe complement of whatsoever kindled
it  And sometimes the light spread over all her face till the smile
prefigured by it was realized  But it was always in frank and open
comradeship

And there was much to cause her to smile as she hurried through the
crowd across the sandspit and over the flat towards the logbuilding
she had pointed out to Mr Thurston  Time had rolled back and
locomotion and transportation were once again in the most primitive
stages  Men who had never carried more than parcels in all their lives
had now become bearers of burdens  They no longer walked upright under
the sun but stooped the body forward and bowed the head to the earth
Every back had become a packsaddle and the strapgalls were beginning
to form  They staggered beneath the unwonted effort and legs became
drunken with weariness and titubated in divers directions till the
sunlight darkened and bearer and burden fell by the way  Other men
exulting secretly piled their goods on twowheeled gocarts and pulled
out blithely enough only to stall at the first spot where the great
round boulders invaded the trail  Whereat they generalized anew upon
the principles of Alaskan travel discarded the gocart or trundled it
back to the beach and sold it at fabulous price to the last man landed
Tenderfeet with ten pounds of Colts revolvers cartridges and
huntingknives belted about them wandered valiantly up the trail and
crept back softly shedding revolvers cartridges and knives in
despairing showers  And so in gasping and bitter sweat these sons of
Adam suffered for Adams sin

Frona felt vaguely disturbed by this great throbbing rush of goldmad
men and the old scene with its clustering associations seemed blotted
out by these toiling aliens  Even the old landmarks appeared strangely
unfamiliar  It was the same yet not the same  Here on the grassy
flat where she had played as a child and shrunk back at the sound of
her voice echoing from glacier to glacier ten thousand men tramped
ceaselessly up and down grinding the tender herbage into the soil and
mocking the stony silence  And just up the trail were ten thousand men
who had passed by and over the Chilcoot were ten thousand more  And
behind all down the islandstudded Alaskan coast even to the Horn
were yet ten thousand more harnessers of wind and steam hasteners
from the ends of the earth  The Dyea River as of old roared
turbulently down to the sea but its ancient banks were gored by the
feet of many men and these men labored in surging rows at the dripping
towlines and the deepladen boats followed them as they fought their
upward way  And the will of man strove with the will of the water and
the men laughed at the old Dyea River and gored its banks deeper for
the men who were to follow

The doorway of the store through which she had once run out and in
and where she had looked with awe at the unusual sight of a stray
trapper or furtrader was now packed with a clamorous throng of men
Where of old one letter waiting a claimant was a thing of wonder she
now saw by peering through the window the mail heaped up from floor
to ceiling  And it was for this mail the men were clamoring so
insistently  Before the store by the scales was another crowd  An
Indian threw his pack upon the scales the white owner jotted down the
weight in a notebook and another pack was thrown on  Each pack was
in the straps ready for the packers back and the precarious journey
over the Chilcoot  Frona edged in closer  She was interested in
freights  She remembered in her day when the solitary prospector or
trader had his outfit packed over for six centsone hundred and
twenty dollars a ton

The tenderfoot who was weighing up consulted his guidebook  Eight
cents he said to the Indian  Whereupon the Indians laughed
scornfully and chorused Forty cents  A pained expression came into
his face and he looked about him anxiously  The sympathetic light in
Fronas eyes caught him and he regarded her with intent blankness  In
reality he was busy reducing a threeton outfit to terms of cash at
forty dollars per hundredweight  Twentyfour hundred dollars for
thirty miles he cried  What can I do

Frona shrugged her shoulders  Youd better pay them the forty cents
she advised else they will take off their straps

The man thanked her but instead of taking heed went on with his
haggling  One of the Indians stepped up and proceeded to unfasten his
packstraps  The tenderfoot wavered but just as he was about to give
in the packers jumped the price on him to fortyfive cents  He smiled
after a sickly fashion and nodded his head in token of surrender  But
another Indian joined the group and began whispering excitedly  A
cheer went up and before the man could realize it they had jerked off
their straps and departed spreading the news as they went that freight
to Lake Linderman was fifty cents

Of a sudden the crowd before the store was perceptibly agitated  Its
members whispered excitedly one to another and all their eyes were
focussed upon three men approaching from up the trail  The trio were
ordinarylooking creatures illclad and even ragged  In a more stable
community their apprehension by the village constable and arrest for
vagrancy would have been immediate  French Louis the tenderfeet
whispered and passed the word along  Owns three Eldorado claims in a
block the man next to Frona confided to her  Worth ten millions at
the very least  French Louis striding a little in advance of his
companions did not look it  He had parted company with his hat
somewhere along the route and a frayed silk kerchief was wrapped
carelessly about his head  And for all his ten millions he carried
his own travelling pack on his broad shoulders  And that one the one
with the beard thats Swiftwater Bill another of the Eldorado kings

How do you know Frona asked doubtingly

Know the man exclaimed  Know  Why his picture has been in all the
papers for the last six weeks  See He unfolded a newspaper  And a
pretty good likeness too  Ive looked at it so much Id know his mug
among a thousand

Then who is the third one she queried tacitly accepting him as a
fount of authority

Her informant lifted himself on his toes to see better  I dont
know he confessed sorrowfully then tapped the shoulder of the man
next to him  Who is the lean smoothfaced one  The one with the
blue shirt and the patch on his knee

Just then Frona uttered a glad little cry and darted forward  Matt
she cried  Matt McCarthy

The man with the patch shook her hand heartily though he did not know
her and distrust was plain in his eyes

Oh you dont remember me she chattered  And dont you dare say
you do  If there werent so many looking Id hug you you old bear

And so Big Bear went home to the Little Bears she recited solemnly
And the Little Bears were very hungry  And Big Bear said Guess what
I have got my children  And one Little Bear guessed berries and one
Little Bear guessed salmon and tother Little Bear guessed porcupine
Then Big Bear laughed Whoof  Whoof and said A Nice Big Fat
Man

As he listened recollection avowed itself in his face and when she
had finished his eyes wrinkled up and he laughed a peculiar laughable
silent laugh

Sure an its well I know ye he explained but for the life iv me
I cant put me finger on ye

She pointed into the store and watched him anxiously

Now I have ye  He drew back and looked her up and down and his
expression changed to disappointment  It cuddent be  I mistook ye
Ye cud niver alived in that shanty thrusting a thumb in the
direction of the store

Frona nodded her head vigorously

Thin its yer ownself afther all  The little motherless darlin with
the goold hair I combed the knots out iv manys the time  The little
witch that run barefoot an barelegged over all the place

Yes yes she corroborated gleefully

The little divil that stole the dogteam an wint over the Pass in the
dead o winter for to see where the world come to an ind on the ither
side just because old Matt McCarthy was afther tellin her fairy
stories

O Matt dear old Matt  Remember the time I went swimming with the
Siwash girls from the Indian camp

An I dragged ye out by the hair o yer head

And lost one of your new rubber boots

Ah an sure an I do  And a most shockin an immodest affair it
was  An the boots was worth tin dollars over yer fathers counter

And then you went away over the Pass to the Inside and we never
heard a word of you  Everybody thought you dead

Well I recollect the day  An ye cried in me arms an wuddent kiss
yer old Matt goodby  But ye did in the ind he exclaimed
triumphantly whin ye saw I was goin to lave ye for sure  What a wee
thing ye were

I was only eight

An tis twelve year agone  Twelve year Ive spint on the Inside
with niver a trip out  Ye must be twinty now

And almost as big as you Frona affirmed

A likely woman yeve grown into tall an shapely an all that  He
looked her over critically  But ye cud a stood a bit more flesh
Im thinkin

No no she denied  Not at twenty Matt not at twenty  Feel my
arm youll see  She doubled that member till the biceps knotted

Tis muscle he admitted passing his hand admiringly over the
swelling bunch just as though yed been workin hard for yer livin

Oh I can swing clubs and box and fence she cried successively
striking the typical postures and swim and make high dives chin a
bar twenty times andand walk on my hands  There

Is that what yeve been doin  I thought ye wint away for
booklarnin he commented dryly

But they have new ways of teaching now Matt and they dont turn you
out with your head crammed

An yer legs that spindly they cant carry it all  Well an I
forgive ye yer muscle

But how about yourself Matt Frona asked  How has the world been
to you these twelve years

Behold  He spread his legs apart threw his head back and his chest
out  Ye now behold Mister Matthew McCarthy a king iv the noble
Eldorado Dynasty by the strength iv his own right arm  Me possessions
is limitless  I have more dust in wan minute than iver I saw in all me
life before  Me intintion for makin this trip to the States is to
look up me ancestors  I have a firm belafe that they wance existed
Ye may find nuggets in the Klondike but niver good whiskey  Tis
likewise me intintion to have wan drink iv the rate stuff before I die
Afther that tis me sworn resolve to return to the superveeshion iv me
Klondike properties  Indade and Im an Eldorado king an if yell be
wantin the lind iv a tidy bit its meself thatll loan it ye

The same old old Matt who never grows old Frona laughed

An its yerself is the thrue Welse for all yer prizefighters
muscles an yer philosophers brains  But lets wander inside on the
heels of Louis an Swiftwater  Andys still tindin store Im told
an well see if I still linger in the pages iv his mimory

And I also Frona seized him by the hand  It was a bad habit she
had of seizing the hands of those she loved  Its ten years since I
went away

The Irishman forged his way through the crowd like a piledriver and
Frona followed easily in the lee of his bulk  The tenderfeet watched
them reverently for to them they were as Northland divinities  The
buzz of conversation rose again

Whos the girl somebody asked  And just as Frona passed inside the
door she caught the opening of the answer Jacob Welses daughter
Never heard of Jacob Welse  Where have you been keeping yourself




CHAPTER II

She came out of the wood of glistening birch and with the first fires
of the sun blazoning her unbound hair raced lightly across the
dewdripping meadow  The earth was fat with excessive moisture and
soft to her feet while the dank vegetation slapped against her knees
and cast off flashing sprays of liquid diamonds  The flush of the
morning was in her cheek and its fire in her eyes and she was aglow
with youth and love  For she had nursed at the breast of naturein
forfeit of a motherand she loved the old trees and the creeping
green things with a passionate love and the dim murmur of growing life
was a gladness to her ears and the damp earthsmells were sweet to her
nostrils

Where the upperreach of the meadow vanished in a dark and narrow
forest aisle amid cleanstemmed dandelions and colorbursting
buttercups she came upon a bunch of great Alaskan violets  Throwing
herself at full length she buried her face in the fragrant coolness
and with her hands drew the purple heads in circling splendor about her
own  And she was not ashamed  She had wandered away amid the
complexities and smirch and withering heats of the great world and she
had returned simple and clean and wholesome  And she was glad of
it as she lay there slipping back to the old days when the universe
began and ended at the skyline and when she journeyed over the Pass
to behold the Abyss

It was a primitive life that of her childhood with few conventions
but such as there were stern ones  And they might be epitomized as
she had read somewhere in her later years as the faith of food and
blanket  This faith had her father kept she thought remembering
that his name sounded well on the lips of men  And this was the faith
she had learnedthe faith she had carried with her across the Abyss
and into the world where men had wandered away from the old truths and
made themselves selfish dogmas and casuistries of the subtlest kinds
the faith she had brought back with her still fresh and young and
joyous  And it was all so simple she had contended why should not
their faith be as her faiththe faith of food and blanket  The
faith of trail and hunting camp  The faith with which strong clean men
faced the quick danger and sudden death by field and flood  Why not
The faith of Jacob Welse  Of Matt McCarthy  Of the Indian boys she
had played with  Of the Indian girls she had led to Amazonian war  Of
the very wolfdogs straining in the harnesses and running with her
across the snow  It was healthy it was real it was good she
thought and she was glad

The rich notes of a robin saluted her from the birch wood and opened
her ears to the day  A partridge boomed afar in the forest and a
treesquirrel launched unerringly into space above her head and went
on from limb to limb and tree to tree scolding graciously the while
From the hidden river rose the shouts of the toiling adventurers
already parted from sleep and fighting their way towards the Pole

Frona arose shook back her hair and took instinctively the old path
between the trees to the camp of Chief George and the Dyea tribesmen
She came upon a boy breechclouted and bare like a copper god  He
was gathering wood and looked at her keenly over his bronze shoulder
She bade him goodmorning blithely in the Dyea tongue but he shook
his head and laughed insultingly and paused in his work to hurl
shameful words after her  She did not understand for this was not the
old way and when she passed a great and glowering Sitkan buck she kept
her tongue between her teeth  At the fringe of the forest the camp
confronted her  And she was startled  It was not the old camp of a
score or more of lodges clustering and huddling together in the open as
though for company but a mighty camp  It began at the very forest
and flowed in and out among the scattered treeclumps on the flat and
spilled over and down to the river bank where the long canoes were
lined up ten and twelve deep  It was a gathering of the tribes like
unto none in all the past and a thousand miles of coast made up the
tally  They were all strange Indians with wives and chattels and
dogs  She rubbed shoulders with Juneau and Wrangel men and was
jostled by wildeyed Sticks from over the Passes fierce Chilcats and
Queen Charlotte Islanders  And the looks they cast upon her were black
and frowning saveand far worsewhere the merrier souls leered
patronizingly into her face and chuckled unmentionable things

She was not frightened by this insolence but angered for it hurt her
and embittered the pleasurable homecoming  Yet she quickly grasped
the significance of it the old patriarchal status of her fathers time
had passed away and civilization in a scorching blast had swept down
upon this people in a day  Glancing under the raised flaps of a tent
she saw haggardfaced bucks squatting in a circle on the floor  By the
door a heap of broken bottles advertised the vigils of the night  A
white man low of visage and shrewd was dealing cards about and gold
and silver coins leaped into heaping bets upon the blanket board  A
few steps farther on she heard the cluttering whirl of a wheel of
fortune and saw the Indians men and women chancing eagerly their
sweatearned wages for the gaudy prizes of the game  And from tepee
and lodge rose the cracked and crazy strains of cheap musicboxes

An old squaw peeling a willow pole in the sunshine of an open doorway
raised her head and uttered a shrill cry

HeeHee  Tenas HeeHee she muttered as well and as excitedly as her
toothless gums would permit

Frona thrilled at the cry  Tenas HeeHee  Little Laughter  Her name
of the long gone Indian past  She turned and went over to the old
woman

And hast thou so soon forgotten Tenas HeeHee she mumbled  And
thine eyes so young and sharp  Not so soon does Neepoosa forget

It is thou Neepoosa Frona cried her tongue halting from the disuse
of years

Ay it is Neepoosa the old woman replied drawing her inside the
tent and despatching a boy hotfooted on some errand  They sat down
together on the floor and she patted Fronas hand lovingly peering
meanwhile bleareyed and misty into her face  Ay it is Neepoosa
grown old quickly after the manner of our women  Neepoosa who dandled
thee in her arms when thou wast a child  Neepoosa who gave thee thy
name Tenas HeeHee  Who fought for thee with Death when thou wast
ailing and gathered growing things from the woods and grasses of the
earth and made of them tea and gave thee to drink  But I mark little
change for I knew thee at once  It was thy very shadow on the ground
that made me lift my head  A little change mayhap  Tall thou art
and like a slender willow in thy grace and the sun has kissed thy
cheeks more lightly of the years but there is the old hair flying
wild and of the color of the brown seaweed floating on the tide and
the mouth quick to laugh and loth to cry  And the eyes are as clear
and true as in the days when Neepoosa chid thee for wrongdoing and
thou wouldst not put false words upon thy tongue  Ai  Ai  Not as
thou art the other women who come now into the land

And why is a white woman without honor among you Frona demanded
Your men say evil things to me in the camp and as I came through the
woods even the boys  Not in the old days when I played with them
was this shame so

Ai  Ai Neepoosa made answer  It is so  But do not blame them
Pour not thine anger upon their heads  For it is true it is the fault
of thy women who come into the land these days  They can point to no
man and say That is my man  And it is not good that women should he
thus  And they look upon all men boldeyed and shameless and their
tongues are unclean and their hearts bad  Wherefore are thy women
without honor among us  As for the boys they are but boys  And the
men how should they know

The tentflaps were poked aside and an old man came in  He grunted to
Frona and sat down  Only a certain eager alertness showed the delight
he took in her presence

So Tenas HeeHee has come back in these bad days he vouchsafed in a
shrill quavering voice

And why bad days Muskim Frona asked  Do not the women wear
brighter colors  Are not the bellies fuller with flour and bacon and
white mans grub  Do not the young men contrive great wealth what of
their packstraps and paddles  And art thou not remembered with the
ancient offerings of meat and fish and blanket  Why bad days Muskim

True he replied in his fine priestly way a reminiscent flash of
the old fire lighting his eyes  It is very true  The women wear
brighter colors  But they have found favor in the eyes of thy white
men and they look no more upon the young men of their own blood
Wherefore the tribe does not increase nor do the little children
longer clutter the way of our feet  It is so  The bellies are fuller
with the white mans grub but also are they fuller with the white
mans bad whiskey  Nor could it be otherwise that the young men
contrive great wealth but they sit by night over the cards and it
passes from them and they speak harsh words one to another and in
anger blows are struck and there is bad blood between them  As for
old Muskim there are few offerings of meat and fish and blanket  For
the young women have turned aside from the old paths nor do the young
men longer honor the old totems and the old gods  So these are bad
days Tenas HeeHee and they behold old Muskim go down in sorrow to
the grave

Ai  Ai  It is so wailed Neepoosa

Because of the madness of thy people have my people become mad
Muskim continued  They come over the salt sea like the waves of the
sea thy people and they goah who knoweth where

Ai  Who knoweth where Neepoosa lamented rocking slowly back and
forth

Ever they go towards the frost and cold and ever do they come more
people wave upon wave

Ai  Ai  Into the frost and cold  It is a long way and dark and
cold  She shivered then laid a sudden hand on Fronas arm  And
thou goest

Frona nodded

And Tenas HeeHee goest  Ai  Ai  Ai

The tentflap lifted and Matt McCarthy peered in  Its yerself
Frona is it  With breakfast waitin this halfhour on ye an old
Andy fumin an frettin like the old woman he is  Goodmornin to ye
Neepoosa he addressed Fronas companions an to ye Muskim though
belike yeve little mimory iv me face

The old couple grunted salutation and remained stolidly silent

But hurry with ye girl turning back to Frona  Me steamer starts
by midday an its little Ill see iv ye at the best  An likewise
theres Andy an the breakfast pipin hot both iv them




CHAPTER III

Frona waved her hand to Andy and swung out on the trail  Fastened
tightly to her back were her camera and a small travelling satchel  In
addition she carried for alpenstock the willow pole of Neepoosa  Her
dress was of the mountaineering sort shortskirted and scant allowing
the greatest play with the least material and withal gray of color and
modest

Her outfit on the backs of a dozen Indians and in charge of Del
Bishop had got under way hours before  The previous day on her
return with Matt McCarthy from the Siwash camp she had found Del
Bishop at the store waiting her  His business was quickly transacted
for the proposition he made was terse and to the point  She was going
into the country  He was intending to go in  She would need somebody
If she had not picked any one yet why he was just the man  He had
forgotten to tell her the day he took her ashore that he had been in
the country years before and knew all about it  True he hated the
water and it was mainly a water journey but he was not afraid of it
He was afraid of nothing  Further he would fight for her at the drop
of the hat  As for pay when they got to Dawson a good word from her
to Jacob Welse and a years outfit would be his  No no no
grubstake about it no strings on him  He would pay for the outfit
later on when his sack was dusted  What did she think about it
anyway  And Frona did think about it for ere she had finished
breakfast he was out hustling the packers together

She found herself making better speed than the majority of her fellows
who were heavily laden and had to rest their packs every few hundred
yards  Yet she found herself hard put to keep the pace of a bunch of
Scandinavians ahead of her  They were huge strapping blondhaired
giants each striding along with a hundred pounds on his back and all
harnessed to a gocart which carried fully six hundred more  Their
faces were as laughing suns and the joy of life was in them  The toil
seemed childs play and slipped from them lightly  They joked with one
another and with the passersby in a meaningless tongue and their
great chests rumbled with cavernechoing laughs  Men stood aside for
them and looked after them enviously for they took the rises of the
trail on the run and rattled down the counter slopes and ground the
ironrimmed wheels harshly over the rocks  Plunging through a dark
stretch of woods they came out upon the river at the ford  A drowned
man lay on his back on the sandbar staring upward unblinking at the
sun  A man in irritated tones was questioning over and over
Wheres his pardner  Aint he got a pardner  Two more men had
thrown off their packs and were coolly taking an inventory of the dead
mans possessions  One called aloud the various articles while the
other checked them off on a piece of dirty wrappingpaper  Letters and
receipts wet and pulpy strewed the sand  A few gold coins were
heaped carelessly on a white handkerchief  Other men crossing back
and forth in canoes and skiffs took no notice

The Scandinavians glanced at the sight and their faces sobered for a
moment  Wheres his pardner  Aint he got a pardner the irritated
man demanded of them  They shook their heads  They did not understand
English  They stepped into the water and splashed onward  Some one
called warningly from the opposite bank whereat they stood still and
conferred together  Then they started on again  The two men taking
the inventory turned to watch  The current rose nigh to their hips
but it was swift and they staggered while now and again the cart
slipped sideways with the stream  The worst was over and Frona found
herself holding her breath  The water had sunk to the knees of the two
foremost men when a strap snapped on one nearest the cart  His pack
swung suddenly to the side overbalancing him  At the same instant the
man next to him slipped and each jerked the other under  The next two
were whipped off their feet while the cart turning over swept from
the bottom of the ford into the deep water  The two men who had almost
emerged threw themselves backward on the pullropes  The effort was
heroic but giants though they were the task was too great and they
were dragged inch by inch downward and under

Their packs held them to the bottom save him whose strap had broken
This one struck out not to the shore but down the stream striving to
keep up with his comrades  A couple of hundred feet below the rapid
dashed over a toothedreef of rocks and here a minute later they
appeared  The cart still loaded showed first smashing a wheel and
turning over and over into the next plunge  The men followed in a
miserable tangle  They were beaten against the submerged rocks and
swept on all but one  Frona in a canoe a dozen canoes were already
in pursuit saw him grip the rock with bleeding fingers  She saw his
white face and the agony of the effort but his hold relaxed and he was
jerked away just as his free comrade swimming mightily was reaching
for him  Hidden from sight they took the next plunge showing for a
second still struggling at the shallow foot of the rapid

A canoe picked up the swimming man but the rest disappeared in a long
stretch of swift deep water  For a quarter of an hour the canoes
plied fruitlessly about then found the dead men gently grounded in an
eddy  A towrope was requisitioned from an upcoming boat and a pair
of horses from a packtrain on the bank and the ghastly jetsam hauled
ashore  Frona looked at the five young giants lying in the mud
brokenboned limp uncaring  They were still harnessed to the cart
and the poor worthless packs still clung to their backs The sixth sat
in the midst dryeyed and stunned  A dozen feet away the steady flood
of life flowed by and Frona melted into it and went on


The dark spruceshrouded mountains drew close together in the Dyea
Canyon and the feet of men churned the wet sunless earth into mire and
boghole  And when they had done this they sought new paths till
there were many paths  And on such a path Frona came upon a man spread
carelessly in the mud  He lay on his side legs apart and one arm
buried beneath him pinned down by a bulky pack  His cheek was
pillowed restfully in the ooze and on his face there was an expression
of content  He brightened when he saw her and his eyes twinkled
cheerily

Bout time you hove along he greeted her  Been waitin an hour on
you as it is

Thats it as Frona bent over him  Just unbuckle that strap  The
pesky thing  Twas just out o my reach all the time

Are you hurt she asked

He slipped out of his straps shook himself and felt the twisted arm
Nope  Sound as a dollar thank you  And no kick to register
either  He reached over and wiped his muddy hands on a lowbowed
spruce  Just my luck but I got a good rest so whats the good of
makin a beef about it  You see I tripped on that little root there
and slip slump slam and slushthere I was down and out and the
buckle just out o reach  And there I lay for a blasted hour
everybody hitting the lower path

But why didnt you call out to them

And make em climb up the hill to me  Them all tuckered out with
their own work  Not on your life  Wasnt serious enough  If any
other man d make me climb up just because hed slipped down Id take
him out o the mud all right all right and punch and punch him back
into the mud again  Besides I knew somebody was bound to come along
my way after a while

Oh youll do she cried appropriating Del Bishops phrase  Youll
do for this country

Yep he called back shouldering his pack and starting off at a
lively clip  And anyway I got a good rest

The trail dipped through a precipitous morass to the rivers brink  A
slender pinetree spanned the screaming foam and bent midway to touch
the water  The surge beat upon the taper trunk and gave it a
rhythmical swaying motion while the feet of the packers had worn
smooth its wavewashed surface  Eighty feet it stretched in ticklish
insecurity  Frona stepped upon it felt it move beneath her heard the
bellowing of the water saw the mad rushand shrank back  She slipped
the knot of her shoelaces and pretended great care in the tying
thereof as a bunch of Indians came out of the woods above and down
through the mud  Three or four bucks led the way followed by many
squaws all bending in the headstraps to the heavy packs  Behind came
the children burdened according to their years and in the rear half a
dozen dogs tongues lagging out and dragging forward painfully under
their several loads

The men glanced at her sideways and one of them said something in an
undertone   Frona could not hear but the snicker which went down the
line brought the flush of shame to her brow and told her more forcibly
than could the words  Her face was hot for she sat disgraced in her
own sight but she gave no sign  The leader stood aside and one by
one and never more than one at a time they made the perilous passage
At the bend in the middle their weight forced the tree under and they
felt for their footing up to the ankles in the cold driving torrent
Even the little children made it without hesitancy and then the dogs
whining and reluctant but urged on by the man  When the last had
crossed over he turned to Frona

Um horse trail he said pointing up the mountain side  Much better
you take um horse trail  More far much better

But she shook her head and waited till he reached the farther bank for
she felt the call not only upon her own pride but upon the pride of
her race and it was a greater demand than her demand just as the race
was greater than she  So she put foot upon the log and with the eyes
of the alien people upon her walked down into the foamwhite swirl


She came upon a man weeping by the side of the trail  His pack
clumsily strapped sprawled on the ground  He had taken off a shoe
and one naked foot showed swollen and blistered

What is the matter she asked halting before him

He looked up at her then down into the depths where the Dyea River cut
the gloomy darkness with its living silver  The tears still welled in
his eyes and he sniffled

What is the matter she repeated  Can I be of any help

No he replied  How can you help  My feet are raw and my back is
nearly broken and I am all tired out  Can you help any of these
things

Well judiciously I am sure it might be worse  Think of the men
who have just landed on the beach  It will take them ten days or two
weeks to backtrip their outfits as far as you have already got yours

But my partners have left me and gone on he moaned a sneaking
appeal for pity in his voice  And I am all alone and I dont feel
able to move another step  And then think of my wife and babies  I
left them down in the States  Oh if they could only see me now  I
cant go back to them and I cant go on  Its too much for me  I
cant stand it this working like a horse  I was not made to work like
a horse  Ill die I know I will if I do  Oh what shall I do  What
shall I do

Why did your comrades leave you

Because I was not so strong as they because I could not pack as much
or as long  And they laughed at me and left me

Have you ever roughed it Frona asked

No

You look well put up and strong  Weigh probably one hundred and
sixtyfive

One hundredand seventy he corrected

You dont look as though you had ever been troubled with sickness
Never an invalid

Nno

And your comrades  They are miners

Never mining in their lives  They worked in the same establishment
with me  Thats what makes it so hard dont you see  Wed known one
another for years  And to go off and leave me just because I couldnt
keep up

My friend and Frona knew she was speaking for the race you are
strong as they  You can work just as hard as they pack as much  But
you are weak of heart  This is no place for the weak of heart  You
cannot work like a horse because you will not  Therefore the country
has no use for you  The north wants strong menstrong of soul not
body  The body does not count  So go back to the States  We do not
want you here  If you come you will die and what then of your wife
and babies  So sell out your outfit and go back  You will be home in
three weeks  Goodby


She passed through Sheep Camp  Somewhere above a mighty glacier
under the pent pressure of a subterranean reservoir had burst asunder
and hurled a hundred thousand tons of ice and water down the rocky
gorge  The trail was yet slippery with the slime of the flood and men
were rummaging disconsolately in the rubbish of overthrown tents and
caches  But here and there they worked with nervous haste and the
stark corpses by the trailside attested dumbly to their labor  A few
hundred yards beyond the work of the rush went on uninterrupted  Men
rested their packs on jutting stones swapped escapes whilst they
regained their breath then stumbled on to their toil again


The midday sun beat down upon the stone Scales  The forest had
given up the struggle and the dizzying heat recoiled from the
unclothed rock  On either hand rose the icemarred ribs of earth
naked and strenuous in their nakedness  Above towered stormbeaten
Chilcoot  Up its gaunt and ragged front crawled a slender string of
men  But it was an endless string  It came out of the last fringe of
dwarfed shrub below drew a black line across a dazzling stretch of
ice and filed past Frona where she ate her lunch by the way  And it
went on up the pitch of the steep growing fainter and smaller till
it squirmed and twisted like a column of ants and vanished over the
crest of the pass

Even as she looked Chilcoot was wrapped in rolling mist and whirling
cloud and a storm of sleet and wind roared down upon the toiling
pigmies  The light was swept out of the day and a deep gloom
prevailed but Frona knew that somewhere up there clinging and
climbing and immortally striving the long line of ants still twisted
towards the sky  And she thrilled at the thought strong with mans
ancient love of mastery and stepped into the line which came out of
the storm behind and disappeared into the storm before

She blew through the gap of the pass in a whirlwind of vapor with hand
and foot clambered down the volcanic ruin of Chilcoots mighty father
and stood on the bleak edge of the lake which filled the pit of the
crater  The lake was angry and whitecapped and though a hundred
caches were waiting ferriage no boats were plying back and forth  A
rickety skeleton of sticks in a shell of greased canvas lay upon the
rocks  Frona sought out the owner a brightfaced young fellow with
sharp black eyes and a salient jaw  Yes he was the ferryman but he
had quit work for the day  Water too rough for freighting  He charged
twentyfive dollars for passengers but he was not taking passengers
today  Had he not said it was too rough  That was why

But you will take me surely she asked

He shook his head and gazed out over the lake  At the far end its
rougher than you see it here  Even the big wooden boats wont tackle
it  The last that tried with a gang of packers aboard was blown over
on the west shore  We could see them plainly  And as theres no trail
around from there theyll have to camp it out till the blow is over

But theyre better off than I am  My camp outfit is at Happy Camp
and I cant very well stay here Frona smiled winsomely but there was
no appeal in the smile no feminine helplessness throwing itself on the
strength and chivalry of the male  Do reconsider and take me across

No

Ill give you fifty

No I say

But Im not afraid you know

The young fellows eyes flashed angrily  He turned upon her suddenly
but on second thought did not utter the words forming on his lips  She
realized the unintentional slur she had cast and was about to explain
But on second thought she too remained silent for she read him and
knew that it was perhaps the only way for her to gain her point  They
stood there bodies inclined to the storm in the manner of seamen on
sloped decks unyieldingly looking into each others eyes  His hair
was plastered in wet ringlets on his forehead while hers in longer
wisps beat furiously about her face

Come on then  He flung the boat into the water with an angry jerk
and tossed the oars aboard  Climb in  Ill take you but not for
your fifty dollars  You pay the regulation price and thats all

A gust of the gale caught the light shell and swept it broadside for a
score of feet  The spray drove inboard in a continuous stinging
shower and Frona at once fell to work with the bailingcan

I hope were blown ashore he shouted stooping forward to the oars
It would be embarrassingfor you He looked up savagely into her
face

No she modified but it would be very miserable for both of usa
night without tent blankets or fire  Besides were not going to
blow ashore


She stepped out on the slippery rocks and helped him heave up the
canvas craft and tilt the water out  On either side uprose bare wet
walls of rock  A heavy sleet was falling steadily through which a few
streaming caches showed in the gathering darkness

Youd better hurry up he advised thanking her for the assistance
and relaunching the boat  Two miles of stiff trail from here to Happy
Camp  No wood until you get there so youd best hustle along
Goodby

Frona reached out and took his hand and said You are a brave man

Oh I dont know  He returned the grip with usury and looked his
admiration


A dozen tents held grimly to their pegs on the extreme edge of the
timber line at Happy Camp  Frona weary with the day went from tent
to tent  Her wet skirts clung heavily to her tired limbs while the
wind buffeted her brutally about  Once through a canvas wall she
heard a man apostrophizing gorgeously and felt sure that it was Del
Bishop  But a peep into the interior told a different tale so she
wandered fruitlessly on till she reached the last tent in the camp
She untied the flap and looked in  A spluttering candle showed the one
occupant a man down on his knees and blowing lustily into the
firebox of a smoky Yukon stove




CHAPTER IV

She cast off the lower flapfastenings and entered  The man still blew
into the stove unaware of his company  Frona coughed and he raised a
pair of smokereddened eyes to hers

Certainly he said casually enough  Fasten the flaps and make
yourself comfortable  And thereat returned to his borean task

Hospitable to say the least she commented to herself obeying his
command and coming up to the stove

A heap of dwarfed spruce gnarled and wet and cut to proper
stovelength lay to one side  Frona knew it well creeping and
crawling and twisting itself among the rocks of the shallow alluvial
deposit unlike its arboreal prototype rarely lifting its head more
than a foot from the earth  She looked into the oven found it empty
and filled it with the wet wood  The man arose to his feet coughing
from the smoke which had been driven into his lungs and nodding
approval

When he had recovered his breath Sit down and dry your skirts  Ill
get supper

He put a coffeepot on the front lid of the stove emptied the bucket
into it and went out of the tent after more water  As his back
disappeared Frona dived for her satchel and when he returned a moment
later he found her with a dry skirt on and wringing the wet one out
While he fished about in the grubbox for dishes and eating utensils
she stretched a spare bit of rope between the tentpoles and hung the
skirt on it to dry  The dishes were dirty and as he bent over and
washed them she turned her back and deftly changed her stockings  Her
childhood had taught her the value of wellcared feet for the trail
She put her wet shoes on a pile of wood at the back of the stove
substituting for them a pair of soft and dainty housemoccasins of
Indian make  The fire had now grown strong and she was content to let
her undergarments dry on her body

During all this time neither had spoken a word  Not only had the man
remained silent but he went about his work in so preoccupied a way
that it seemed to Frona that he turned a deaf ear to the words of
explanation she would have liked to utter  His whole bearing conveyed
the impression that it was the most ordinary thing under the sun for a
young woman to come in out of the storm and night and partake of his
hospitality  In one way she liked this but in so far as she did not
comprehend it she was troubled  She had a perception of a something
being taken for granted which she did not understand  Once or twice
she moistened her lips to speak but he appeared so oblivious of her
presence that she withheld

After opening a can of corned beef with the axe he fried half a dozen
thick slices of bacon set the fryingpan back and boiled the coffee
From the grubbox he resurrected the half of a cold heavy flapjack  He
looked at it dubiously and shot a quick glance at her  Then he threw
the sodden thing out of doors and dumped the contents of a seabiscuit
bag upon a camp cloth  The seabiscuit had been crumbled into chips
and fragments and generously soaked by the rain till it had become a
mushy pulpy mass of dirty white

Its all I have in the way of bread he muttered but sit down and
we will make the best of it

One moment  And before he could protest Frona had poured the
seabiscuit into the fryingpan on top of the grease and bacon  To
this she added a couple of cups of water and stirred briskly over the
fire  When it had sobbed and sighed with the heat for some few
minutes she sliced up the corned beef and mixed it in with the rest
And by the time she had seasoned it heavily with salt and black pepper
a savory steam was rising from the concoction

Must say its pretty good stuff he said balancing his plate on his
knee and sampling the mess avidiously  What do you happen to call it

Slumgullion she responded curtly and thereafter the meal went on in
silence

Frona helped him to the coffee studying him intently the while  And
not only was it not an unpleasant face she decided but it was strong
Strong she amended potentially rather than actually  A student she
added for she had seen many students eyes and knew the lasting
impress of the midnight oil long continued and his eyes bore the
impress  Brown eyes she concluded and handsome as the males should
be handsome but she noted with surprise when she refilled his plate
with slumgullion that they were not at all brown in the ordinary
sense but hazelbrown  In the daylight she felt certain and in
times of best health they would seem gray and almost bluegray  She
knew it well her one girl chum and dearest friend had had such an eye

His hair was chestnutbrown glinting in the candlelight to gold and
the hint of waviness in it explained the perceptible droop to his tawny
moustache  For the rest his face was cleanshaven and cut on a good
masculine pattern  At first she found fault with the more than slight
cheekhollows under the cheekbones but when she measured his
wellknit slenderly muscular figure with its deep chest and heavy
shoulders she discovered that she preferred the hollows at least they
did not imply lack of nutrition  The body gave the lie to that while
they themselves denied the vice of overfeeding  Height five feet
nine she summed up from out of her gymnasium experience and age
anywhere between twentyfive and thirty though nearer the former most
likely

Havent many blankets he said abruptly pausing to drain his cup and
set it over on the grubbox  I dont expect my Indians back from Lake
Linderman till morning and the beggars have packed over everything
except a few sacks of flour and the bare camp outfit  However Ive a
couple of heavy ulsters which will serve just as well

He turned his back as though he did not expect a reply and untied a
rubbercovered roll of blankets  Then he drew the two ulsters from a
clothesbag and threw them down on the bedding

Vaudeville artist I suppose

He asked the question seemingly without interest as though to keep the
conversation going and in fact as if he knew the stereotyped answer
beforehand  But to Frona the question was like a blow in the face
She remembered Neepoosas philippic against the white women who were
coming into the land and realized the falseness of her position and
the way in which he looked upon her

But he went on before she could speak  Last night I had two
vaudeville queens and three the night before  Only there was more
bedding then  Its unfortunate isnt it the aptitude they display in
getting lost from their outfits  Yet somehow I have failed to find any
lost outfits so far  And they are all queens it seems  No
understudies or minor turns about themno no  And I presume you
are a queen too

The tooready blood sprayed her cheek and this made her angrier than
did he for whereas she was sure of the steady grip she had on herself
her flushed face betokened a confusion which did not really possess her

No she answered coolly I am not a vaudeville artist

He tossed several sacks of flour to one side of the stove without
replying and made of them the foundation of a bed and with the
remaining sacks he duplicated the operation on the opposite side of the
stove

But you are some kind of an artist then he insisted when he had
finished with an open contempt on the artist

Unfortunately I am not any kind of an artist at all

He dropped the blanket he was folding and straightened his back
Hitherto he had no more than glanced at her but now he scrutinized her
carefully every inch of her from head to heel and back again the cut
of her garments and the very way she did her hair  And he took his
time about it

Oh  I beg pardon was his verdict followed by another stare  Then
you are a very foolish woman dreaming of fortune and shutting your eyes
to the dangers of the pilgrimage  It is only meet that two kinds of
women come into this country  Those who by virtue of wifehood and
daughterhood are respectable and those who are not respectable
Vaudeville stars and artists they call themselves for the sake of
decency and out of courtesy we countenance it  Yes yes I know  But
remember the women who come over the trail must be one or the other
There is no middle course and those who attempt it are bound to fail
So you are a very very foolish girl and you had better turn back
while there is yet a chance  If you will view it in the light of a
loan from a stranger I will advance your passage back to the States
and start an Indian over the trail with you tomorrow for Dyea

Once or twice Frona had attempted to interrupt him but he had waved
her imperatively to silence with his hand

I thank you she began but he broke in

Oh not at all not at all

I thank you she repeated but it happens thatathat you are
mistaken  I have just come over the trail from Dyea and expect to meet
my outfit already in camp here at Happy Camp  They started hours ahead
of me and I cant understand how I passed themyes I do too  A boat
was blown over to the west shore of Crater Lake this afternoon and
they must have been in it  That is where I missed them and came on
As for my turning back I appreciate your motive for suggesting it but
my father is in Dawson and I have not seen him for three years  Also
I have come through from Dyea this day and am tired and I would like
to get some rest  So if you still extend your hospitality Ill go to
bed

Impossible  He kicked the blankets to one side sat down on the
flour sacks and directed a blank look upon her

Areare there any women in the other tents she asked hesitatingly
I did not see any but I may have overlooked

A man and his wife were but they pulled stakes this morning  No
there are no other women exceptexcept two or three in a tent
whicherwhich will not do for you

Do you think I am afraid of their hospitality she demanded hotly
As you said they are women

But I said it would not do he answered absently staring at the
straining canvas and listening to the roar of the storm  A man would
die in the open on a night like this

And the other tents are crowded to the walls he mused  I happen to
know  They have stored all their caches inside because of the water
and they havent room to turn around  Besides a dozen other strangers
are stormbound with them  Two or three asked to spread their beds in
here tonight if they couldnt pinch room elsewhere  Evidently they
have but that does not argue that there is any surplus space left
And anyway

He broke off helplessly  The inevitableness of the situation was
growing

Can I make Deep Lake tonight Frona asked forgetting herself to
sympathize with him then becoming conscious of what she was doing and
bursting into laughter

But you couldnt ford the river in the dark  He frowned at her
levity  And there are no camps between

Are you afraid she asked with just the shadow of a sneer

Not for myself

Well then I think Ill go to bed

I might sit up and keep the fire going he suggested after a pause

Fiddlesticks she cried  As though your foolish little code were
saved in the least  We are not in civilization  This is the trail to
the Pole  Go to bed

He elevated his shoulders in token of surrender  Agreed  What shall
I do then

Help me make my bed of course  Sacks laid crosswise  Thank you
sir but I have bones and muscles that rebel  Here  Pull them
around this way

Under her direction he laid the sacks lengthwise in a double row  This
left an uncomfortable hollow with lumpy sackcorners down the middle
but she smote them flat with the side of the axe and in the same
manner lessened the slope to the walls of the hollow  Then she made a
triple longitudinal fold in a blanket and spread it along the bottom of
the long depression

Hum he soliloquized  Now I see why I sleep so badly  Here goes
And he speedily flung his own sacks into shape

It is plain you are unused to the trail she informed him spreading
the topmost blanket and sitting down

Perhaps so he made answer  But what do you know about this trail
life he growled a little later

Enough to conform she rejoined equivocally pulling out the dried
wood from the oven and replacing it with wet

Listen to it  How it storms he exclaimed  Its growing worse if
worse be possible

The tent reeled under the blows of the wind the canvas booming
hollowly at every shock while the sleet and rain rattled overhead like
skirmishfire grown into a battle  In the lulls they could hear the
water streaming off at the sidewalls with the noise of small
cataracts   He reached up curiously and touched the wet roof  A burst
of water followed instantly at the point of contact and coursed down
upon the grubbox

You mustnt do that Frona cried springing to her feet  She put her
finger on the spot and pressing tightly against the canvas ran it
down to the sidewall  The leak at once stopped  You mustnt do it
you know she reproved

Jove was his reply  And you came through from Dyea today  Arent
you stiff

Quite a bit she confessed candidly and sleepy

Goodnight she called to him several minutes later stretching her
body luxuriously in the warm blankets  And a quarter of an hour after
that Oh I say  Are you awake

Yes his voice came muffled across the stove  What is it

Have you the shavings cut

Shavings he queried sleepily  What shavings

For the fire in the morning of course  So get up and cut them

He obeyed without a word but ere he was done she had ceased to hear
him

The ubiquitous bacon was abroad on the air when she opened her eyes
Day had broken and with it the storm  The wet sun was shining
cheerily over the drenched landscape and in at the widespread flaps
Already work had begun and groups of men were filing past under their
packs  Frona turned over on her side  Breakfast was cooked  Her host
had just put the bacon and fried potatoes in the oven and was engaged
in propping the door ajar with two sticks of firewood

Goodmorning she greeted

And goodmorning to you he responded rising to his feet and picking
up the waterbucket  I dont hope that you slept well for I know you
did

Frona laughed

Im going out after some water he vouchsafed  And when I return I
shall expect you ready for breakfast

After breakfast basking herself in the sun Frona descried a familiar
bunch of men rounding the tail of the glacier in the direction of
Crater Lake  She clapped her hands

There comes my outfit and Del Bishop as shamefaced as can be Im
sure at his failure to connect  Turning to the man and at the same
time slinging camera and satchel over her shoulder So I must say
goodby not forgetting to thank you for your kindness

Oh not at all not at all  Pray dont mention it  Id do the same
for any

Vaudeville artist

He looked his reproach but went on  I dont know your name nor do I
wish to know it

Well I shall not be so harsh for I do know your name MISTER VANCE
CORLISS  I saw it on the shipping tags of course she explained
And I want you to come and see me when you get to Dawson  My name is
Frona Welse  Goodby

Your father is not Jacob Welse he called after her as she ran
lightly down towards the trail

She turned her head and nodded

But Del Bishop was not shamefaced nor even worried  Trust a Welse to
land on their feet on a soft spot he had consoled himself as he
dropped off to sleep the night before  But he was angrymadder n
hops in his own vernacular

Goodmornin he saluted  And its plain by your face you had a
comfortable night of it and no thanks to me

You werent worried were you she asked

Worried  About a Welse  Who  Me  Not on your life  I was too busy
tellin Crater Lake what I thought of it  I dont like the water  I
told you so  And its always playin me scurvynot that Im afraid of
it though

Hey you Pete turning to the Indians  Hit er up  Got to make
Linderman by noon

Frona Welse Vance Corliss was repeating to himself

The whole thing seemed a dream and he reassured himself by turning and
looking after her retreating form  Del Bishop and the Indians were
already out of sight behind a wall of rock  Frona was just rounding
the base  The sun was full upon her and she stood out radiantly
against the black shadow of the wall beyond  She waved her alpenstock
and as he doffed his cap rounded the brink and disappeared




CHAPTER V

The position occupied by Jacob Welse was certainly an anomalous one
He was a giant trader in a country without commerce a ripened product
of the nineteenth century flourishing in a society as primitive as that
of the Mediterranean vandals  A captain of industry and a splendid
monopolist he dominated the most independent aggregate of men ever
drawn together from the ends of the earth  An economic missionary a
commercial St Paul he preached the doctrines of expediency and force
Believing in the natural rights of man a child himself of democracy
he bent all men to his absolutism  Government of Jacob Welse for
Jacob Welse and the people by Jacob Welse was his unwritten gospel
Singlehanded he had carved out his dominion till he gripped the domain
of a dozen Roman provinces  At his ukase the population ebbed and
flowed over a hundred thousand miles of territory and cities sprang up
or disappeared at his bidding

Yet he was a common man  The air of the world first smote his lungs on
the open prairie by the River Platte the blue sky over head and
beneath the green grass of the earth pressing against his tender
nakedness  On the horses his eyes first opened still saddled and
gazing in mild wonder on the miracle for his trapper father had but
turned aside from the trail that the wife might have quiet and the
birth be accomplished  An hour or so and the two which were now
three were in the saddle and overhauling their trapper comrades  The
party had not been delayed no time lost  In the morning his mother
cooked the breakfast over the campfire and capped it with a
fiftymile ride into the next sundown

The trapper father had come of the sturdy Welsh stock which trickled
into early Ohio out of the jostling East and the mother was a nomadic
daughter of the Irish emigrant settlers of Ontario  From both sides
came the Wanderlust of the blood the fever to be moving to be pushing
on to the edge of things  In the first year of his life ere he had
learned the way of his legs Jacob Welse had wandered ahorse through a
thousand miles of wilderness and wintered in a huntinglodge on the
headwaters of the Red River of the North  His first footgear was
moccasins his first taffy the tallow from a moose  His first
generalizations were that the world was composed of great wastes and
white vastnesses and populated with Indians and white hunters like his
father  A town was a cluster of deerskin lodges a tradingpost a
seat of civilization and a factor God Almighty Himself  Rivers and
lakes existed chiefly for mans use in travelling  Viewed in this
light the mountains puzzled him but he placed them away in his
classification of the Inexplicable and did not worry  Men died
sometimes  But their meat was not good to eat and their hides
worthlessperhaps because they did not grow fur  Pelts were
valuable and with a few bales a man might purchase the earth  Animals
were made for men to catch and skin  He did not know what men were
made for unless perhaps for the factor

As he grew older he modified these concepts but the process was a
continual source of naive apprehension and wonderment  It was not
until he became a man and had wandered through half the cities of the
States that this expression of childish wonder passed out of his eyes
and left them wholly keen and alert  At his boys first contact with
the cities while he revised his synthesis of things he also
generalized afresh  People who lived in cities were effeminate  They
did not carry the points of the compass in their heads and they got
lost easily  That was why they elected to stay in the cities  Because
they might catch cold and because they were afraid of the dark they
slept under shelter and locked their doors at night  The women were
soft and pretty but they could not lift a snowshoe far in a days
journey  Everybody talked too much  That was why they lied and were
unable to work greatly with their hands  Finally there was a new
human force called bluff  A man who made a bluff must be dead sure
of it or else be prepared to back it up  Bluff was a very good
thingwhen exercised with discretion

Later though living his life mainly in the woods and mountains he
came to know that the cities were not all bad that a man might live in
a city and still be a man  Accustomed to do battle with natural
forces he was attracted by the commercial battle with social forces
The masters of marts and exchanges dazzled but did not blind him and
he studied them and strove to grasp the secrets of their strength
And further in token that some good did come out of Nazareth in the
full tide of manhood he took to himself a citybred woman  But he
still yearned for the edge of things and the leaven in his blood
worked till they went away and above the Dyea Beach on the rim of the
forest built the big log tradingpost  And here in the mellow of
time he got a proper focus on things and unified the phenomena of
society precisely as he had already unified the phenomena of nature
There was naught in one which could not be expressed in terms of the
other  The same principles underlaid both the same truths were
manifest of both  Competition was the secret of creation  Battle was
the law and the way of progress  The world was made for the strong
and only the strong inherited it and through it all there ran an
eternal equity  To be honest was to be strong  To sin was to weaken
To bluff an honest man was to be dishonest  To bluff a bluffer was to
smite with the steel of justice  The primitive strength was in the
arm the modern strength in the brain  Though it had shifted ground
the struggle was the same old struggle  As of old time men still
fought for the mastery of the earth and the delights thereof  But the
sword had given way to the ledger the mailclad baron to the
softgarbed industrial lord and the centre of imperial political power
to the seat of commercial exchanges  The modern will had destroyed the
ancient brute  The stubborn earth yielded only to force  Brain was
greater than body  The man with the brain could best conquer things
primitive

He did not have much education as education goes  To the three Rs his
mother taught him by campfire and candlelight he had added a
somewhat miscellaneous bookknowledge but he was not burdened with
what he had gathered  Yet he read the facts of life understandingly
and the sobriety which comes of the soil was his and the clear
earthvision

And so it came about that Jacob Welse crossed over the Chilcoot in an
early day and disappeared into the vast unknown  A year later he
emerged at the Russian missions clustered about the mouth of the Yukon
on Bering Sea  He had journeyed down a river three thousand miles
long he had seen things and dreamed a great dream  But he held his
tongue and went to work and one day the defiant whistle of a crazy
sternwheel tub saluted the midnight sun on the dank riverstretch by
Fort o Yukon  It was a magnificent adventure  How he achieved it
only Jacob Welse can tell but with the impossible to begin with plus
the impossible he added steamer to steamer and heaped enterprise upon
enterprise  Along many a thousand miles of river and tributary he
built tradingposts and warehouses  He forced the white mans axe into
the hands of the aborigines and in every village and between the
villages rose the cords of fourfoot firewood for his boilers  On an
island in Bering Sea where the river and the ocean meet he
established a great distributing station and on the North Pacific he
put big ocean steamships while in his offices in Seattle and San
Francisco it took clerks by the score to keep the order and system of
his business

Men drifted into the land  Hitherto famine had driven them out but
Jacob Welse was there now and his grubstores so they wintered in the
frost and groped in the frozen muck for gold  He encouraged them
grubstaked them carried them on the books of the company  His
steamers dragged them up the Koyokuk in the old days of Arctic City
Wherever pay was struck he built a warehouse and a store  The town
followed  He explored he speculated he developed  Tireless
indomitable with the steelglitter in his dark eyes he was everywhere
at once doing all things  In the opening up of a new river he was in
the van and at the tailend also hurrying forward the grub  On the
Outside he fought tradecombinations made alliances with the
corporations of the earth and forced discriminating tariffs from the
great carriers  On the Inside he sold flour and blankets and
tobacco built sawmills staked townsites and sought properties in
copper iron and coal and that the miners should be wellequipped
ransacked the lands of the Arctic even as far as Siberia for
nativemade snowshoes muclucs and parkas

He bore the country on his shoulders saw to its needs did its work
Every ounce of its dust passed through his hands every postcard and
letter of credit  He did its banking and exchange carried and
distributed its mails  He frowned upon competition frightened out
predatory capital bluffed militant syndicates and when they would
not backed his bluff and broke them  And for all yet found time and
place to remember his motherless girl and to love her and to fit her
for the position he had made




CHAPTER VI

So I think captain you will agree that we must exaggerate the
seriousness of the situation  Jacob Welse helped his visitor into his
fur greatcoat and went on  Not that it is not serious but that it
may not become more serious  Both you and I have handled famines
before  We must frighten them and frighten them now before it is too
late  Take five thousand men out of Dawson and there will be grub to
last  Let those five thousand carry their tale of famine to Dyea and
Skaguay and they will prevent five thousand more coming in over the
ice

Quite right  And you may count on the hearty cooperation of the
police Mr Welse  The speaker a strongfaced grizzled man
heavyset and of military bearing pulled up his collar and rested his
hand on the doorknob  I see already thanks to you the newcomers
are beginning to sell their outfits and buy dogs  Lord wont there be
a stampede out over the ice as soon as the river closes down  And each
that sells a thousand pounds of grub and goes lessens the proposition
by one empty stomach and fills another that remains  When does the
Laura start

This morning with three hundred grubless men aboard  Would that they
were three thousand

Amen to that  And by the way when does your daughter arrive

Most any day now  Jacob Welses eyes warmed  And I want you to
dinner when she does and bring along a bunch of your young bucks from
the Barracks  I dont know all their names but just the same extend
the invitation as though from me personally  I havent cultivated the
social side muchno time but see to it that the girl enjoys herself
Fresh from the States and London and shes liable to feel lonesome
You understand

Jacob Welse closed the door tilted his chair back and cocked his feet
on the guardrail of the stove  For one halfminute a girlish vision
wavered in the shimmering air above the stove then merged into a woman
of fair Saxon type

The door opened  Mr Welse Mr Foster sent me to find out if he is
to go on filling signed warehouse orders

Certainly Mr Smith  But tell him to scale them down by half  If a
man holds an order for a thousand pounds give him five hundred

He lighted a cigar and tilted back again in his chair

Captain McGregor wants to see you sir

Send him in

Captain McGregor strode in and remained standing before his employer
The rough hand of the New World had been laid upon the Scotsman from
his boyhood but sterling honesty was written in every line of his
bitterseamed face while a prognathous jaw proclaimed to the onlooker
that honesty was the best policyfor the onlooker at any rate should
he wish to do business with the owner of the jaw  This warning was
backed up by the nose sidetwisted and broken and by a long scar
which ran up the forehead and disappeared in the graygrizzled hair

We throw off the lines in an hour sir so Ive come for the last
word

Good  Jacob Welse whirled his chair about  Captain McGregor

Ay

I had other work cut out for you this winter but I have changed my
mind and chosen you to go down with the Laura  Can you guess why

Captain McGregor swayed his weight from one leg to the other and a
shrewd chuckle of a smile wrinkled the corners of his eyes  Going to
be trouble he grunted

And I couldnt have picked a better man  Mr Bally will give you
detailed instructions as you go aboard  But let me say this If we
cant scare enough men out of the country therell be need for every
pound of grub at Fort Yukon  Understand

Ay

So no extravagance  You are taking three hundred men down with you
The chances are that twice as many more will go down as soon as the
river freezes  Youll have a thousand to feed through the winter  Put
them on rationsworking rationsand see that they work  Cordwood
six dollars per cord and piled on the bank where steamers can make a
landing  No work no rations  Understand

Ay

A thousand men can get ugly if they are idle  They can get ugly
anyway  Watch out they dont rush the caches  If they dodo your
duty

The other nodded grimly  His hands gripped unconsciously while the
scar on his forehead took on a livid hue

There are five steamers in the ice  Make them safe against the spring
breakup  But first transfer all their cargoes to one big cache  You
can defend it better and make the cache impregnable  Send a messenger
down to Fort Burr asking Mr Carter for three of his men  He doesnt
need them  Nothing much is doing at Circle City  Stop in on the way
down and take half of Mr Burdwells men  Youll need them  Therell
be gunfighters in plenty to deal with  Be stiff  Keep things in
check from the start  Remember the man who shoots first comes off
with the whole hide  And keep a constant eye on the grub

And on the fortyfivenineties Captain McGregor rumbled back as he
passed out the door

John MeltonMr Melton sir  Can he see you

See here Welse whats this mean  John Melton followed wrathfully
on the heels of the clerk and he almost walked over him as he
flourished a paper before the head of the company  Read that  Whats
it stand for

Jacob Welse glanced over it and looked up coolly  One thousand pounds
of grub

Thats what I say but that fellow youve got in the warehouse says
nofive hundreds all its good for

He spoke the truth

But

It stands for one thousand pounds but in the warehouse it is only
good for five hundred

That your signature thrusting the receipt again into the others
line of vision

Yes

Then what are you going to do about it

Give you five hundred  What are you going to do about it

Refuse to take it

Very good  There is no further discussion

Yes there is  I propose to have no further dealings with you  Im
rich enough to freight my own stuff in over the Passes and I will next
year  Our business stops right now and for all time

I cannot object to that  You have three hundred thousand dollars in
dust deposited with me  Go to Mr Atsheler and draw it at once

The man fumed impotently up and down  Cant I get that other five
hundred  Great God man  Ive paid for it  You dont intend me to
starve

Look here Melton  Jacob Welse paused to knock the ash from his
cigar  At this very moment what are you working for  What are you
trying to get

A thousand pounds of grub

For your own stomach

The Bonanzo king nodded his head

Just so  The lines showed more sharply on Jacob Welses forehead
You are working for your own stomach  I am working for the stomachs
of twenty thousand

But you filled Tim McReadys thousand pounds yesterday all right

The scaledown did not go into effect until today

But why am I the one to get it in the neck hard

Why didnt you come yesterday and Tim McReady today

Meltons face went blank and Jacob Welse answered his own question
with shrugging shoulders

Thats the way it stands Melton  No favoritism  If you hold me
responsible for Tim McReady I shall hold you responsible for not
coming yesterday  Better we both throw it upon Providence  You went
through the Forty Mile Famine You are a white man  A Bonanzo
property or a block of Bonanzo properties does not entitle you to a
pound more than the oldest penniless sourdough or the newest baby
born  Trust me  As long as I have a pound of grub you shall not
starve  Stiffen up  Shake hands  Get a smile on your face and make
the best of it

Still savage of spirit though rapidly toning down the king shook
hands and flung out of the room  Before the door could close on his
heels a loosejointed Yankee shambled in thrust a moccasined foot to
the side and hooked a chair under him and sat down

Say he opened up confidentially peoples gittin scairt over the
grub proposition I guess some

Hello Dave  That you

Spose so  But ez I was saying therell be a lively stampede fer the
Outside soon as the river freezes

Think so

Unh huh

Then Im glad to hear it  Its what the country needs  Going to join
them

Not in a thousand years  Dave Harney threw his head back with smug
complacency  Freighted my truck up to the mine yesterday  Want a
bit too soon about it either  But say     Suthin happened to the
sugar  Had it all on the last sled an jest where the trail turns off
the Klondike into Bonanzo what does that sled do but break through the
ice  I never seen the beat of itthe last sled of all an all the
sugar  So I jest thought Id drop in today an git a hundred pounds
or so  White or brown I aint pertickler

Jacob Welse shook his head and smiled but Harney hitched his chair
closer

The clerk of yourn said he didnt know an ez there want no call to
pester him I said Id jest drop round an see you  I dont care what
its wuth  Make it a hundred even thatll do me handy

Say he went on easily noting the decidedly negative poise of the
others head  Ive got a tolerable sweet tooth I have  Recollect
the taffy I made over on Preacher Creek that time  I declare how time
does fly  That was all of six years ago if its a day  Moren that
surely  Seven by the Jimcracky  But ez I was sayin Id ruther do
without my plug of Star than sugar  An about that sugar  Got my
dogs outside  Better go round to the warehouse an git it eh  Pretty
good idea

But he saw the No shaping on Jacob Welses lips and hurried on
before it could be uttered

Now I dont want to hog it  Wouldnt do that fer the world  So if
yer short I can put up with seventyfive he studied the others
face an I might do with fifty  I preciate your position an I
aint lowdown critter enough to pester

Whats the good of spilling words Dave  We havent a pound of sugar
to spare

Ez I was sayin I aint no hog an seein s its you Welse Ill
make to scrimp along on twentyfive

Not an ounce

Not the least leetle mite  Well well dont git het up  Well jest
fergit I ast you fer any an Ill drop round some likelier time  So
long  Say  He threw his jaw to one side and seemed to stiffen the
muscles of his ear as he listened intently  Thats the Lauras
whistle  Shes startin soon  Goin to see her off  Come along

Jacob Welse pulled on his bearskin coat and mittens and they passed
through the outer offices into the main store  So large was it that
the tenscore purchasers before the counters made no apparent crowd
Many were seriousfaced and more than one looked darkly at the head of
the company as he passed  The clerks were selling everything except
grub and it was grub that was in demand  Holding it for a rise
Famine prices a redwhiskered miner sneered  Jacob Welse heard it
but took no notice  He expected to hear it many times and more
unpleasantly ere the scare was over

On the sidewalk he stopped to glance over the public bulletins posted
against the side of the building  Dogs lost found and for sale
occupied some space but the rest was devoted to notices of sales of
outfits  The timid were already growing frightened  Outfits of five
hundred pounds were offering at a dollar a pound without flour
others with flour at a dollar and a half  Jacob Welse saw Melton
talking with an anxiousfaced newcomer and the satisfaction displayed
by the Bonanzo king told that he had succeeded in filling his winters
cache

Why dont you smell out the sugar Dave Jacob Welse asked pointing
to the bulletins

Dave Harney looked his reproach  Mebbe you think I aint ben
smellin  Ive clean wore my dogs out chasin round from Klondike City
to the Hospital  Cant git yer fingers on it fer love or money

They walked down the blocklong sidewalk past the warehouse doors and
the long teams of waiting huskies curled up in wolfish comfort in the
snow  It was for this snow the first permanent one of the fall that
the miners upcreek had waited to begin their freighting

Curious aint it Dave hazarded suggestively as they crossed the
main street to the river bank  Mighty curiousme ownin two
fivehundredfoot Eldorado claims an a fraction wuth five millions if
Im wuth a cent an no sweetenin fer my coffee or mush  Why
goshdangit this country kin go to blazes  Ill sell out  Ill quit
it cold  IllIllgo back to the States

Oh no you wont Jacob Welse answered  Ive heard you talk
before  You put in a year up Stuart River on straight meat if I
havent forgotten  And you ate salmonbelly and dogs up the Tanana to
say nothing of going through two famines and you havent turned your
back on the country yet  And you never will  And youll die here as
sure as thats the Lauras spring being hauled aboard  And I look
forward confidently to the day when I shall ship you out in a
leadlined box and burden the San Francisco end with the trouble of
winding up your estate  You are a fixture and you know it

As he talked he constantly acknowledged greetings from the passersby
Those who knew him were mainly oldtimers and he knew them all by name
though there was scarcely a newcomer to whom his face was not familiar

Ill jest bet Ill be in Paris in  the Eldorado king protested
feebly

But Jacob Welse did not hear  There was a jangling of gongs as
McGregor saluted him from the pilothouse and the Laura slipped out
from the bank  The men on the shore filled the air with goodluck
farewells and last advice but the three hundred grubless ones turning
their backs on the golden dream were moody and dispirited and made
small response  The Laura backed out through a channel cut in the
shoreice swung about in the current and with a final blast put on
full steam ahead

The crowd thinned away and went about its business leaving Jacob Welse
the centre of a group of a dozen or so  The talk was of the famine
but it was the talk of men  Even Dave Harney forgot to curse the
country for its sugar shortage and waxed facetious over the
newcomerschechaquos he called them having recourse to the Siwash
tongue  In the midst of his remarks his quick eye lighted on a black
speck floating down with the mushice of the river  Jest look at
that he cried  A Peterborough canoe runnin the ice

Twisting and turning now paddling now shoving clear of the floating
cakes the two men in the canoe worked in to the rimice along the
edge of which they drifted waiting for an opening  Opposite the
channel cut out by the steamer they drove their paddles deep and
darted into the calm dead water  The waiting group received them with
open arms helping them up the bank and carrying their shell after them

In its bottom were two leather mailpouches a couple of blankets
coffeepot and fryingpan and a scant grubsack  As for the men so
frosted were they and so numb with the cold that they could hardly
stand  Dave Harney proposed whiskey and was for haling them away at
once but one delayed long enough to shake stiff hands with Jacob Welse

Shes coming he announced  Passed her boat an hour back  It ought
to be round the bend any minute  Ive got despatches for you but Ill
see you later  Got to get something into me first  Turning to go
with Harney he stopped suddenly and pointed up stream  There she is
now  Just coming out past the bluff

Run along boys an git yer whiskey Harney admonished him and his
mate  Tell m its on me double dose an jest excuse me not
drinkin with you fer Im goin to stay

The Klondike was throwing a thick flow of ice partly mush and partly
solid and swept the boat out towards the middle of the Yukon  They
could see the struggle plainly from the bankfour men standing up and
poling a way through the jarring cakes  A Yukon stove aboard was
sending up a trailing pillar of blue smoke and as the boat drew
closer they could see a woman in the stern working the long
steeringsweep  At sight of this there was a snap and sparkle in Jacob
Welses eyes  It was the first omen and it was good he thought  She
was still a Welse a struggler and a fighter  The years of her culture
had not weakened her  Though tasting of the fruits of the first remove
from the soil she was not afraid of the soil she could return to it
gleefully and naturally

So he mused till the boat drove in icerimed and battered against the
edge of the rimice  The one white man aboard sprang out painter in
hand to slow it down and work into the channel  But the rimice was
formed of the night and the front of it shelved off with him into the
current  The nose of the boat sheered out under the pressure of a
heavy cake so that he came up at the stern  The womans arm flashed
over the side to his collar and at the same instant sharp and
authoritative her voice rang out to the Indian oarsmen to back water
Still holding the mans head above water she threw her body against
the sweep and guided the boat sternforemost into the opening  A few
more strokes and it grounded at the foot of the bank  She passed the
collar of the chattering man to Dave Harney who dragged him out and
started him off on the trail of the mailcarriers

Frona stood up her cheeks glowing from the quick work  Jacob Welse
hesitated  Though he stood within reach of the gunwale a gulf of
three years was between  The womanhood of twenty added unto the girl
of seventeen made a sum more prodigious than he had imagined  He did
not know whether to bearhug the radiant young creature or to take her
hand and help her ashore  But there was no apparent hitch for she
leaped beside him and was into his arms  Those above looked away to a
man till the two came up the bank hand in hand

Gentlemen my daughter  There was a great pride in his face

Frona embraced them all with a comrade smile and each man felt that
for an instant her eyes had looked straight into his




CHAPTER VII

That Vance Corliss wanted to see more of the girl he had divided
blankets with goes with the saying  He had not been wise enough to
lug a camera into the country but none the less by a yet subtler
process a sunpicture had been recorded somewhere on his cerebral
tissues  In the flash of an instant it had been done  A wave message
of light and color a molecular agitation and integration a certain
minute though definite corrugation in a brain recessand there it
was a picture complete  The blazing sunlight on the beetling black a
slender gray form radiant starting forward to the vision from the
marge where light and darkness met a fresh young morning smile
wreathed in a flame of burning gold

It was a picture he looked at often and the more he looked the greater
was his desire to see Frona Welse again  This event he anticipated
with a thrill with the exultancy over change which is common of all
life  She was something new a fresh type a woman unrelated to all
women he had met  Out of the fascinating unknown a pair of hazel eyes
smiled into his and a hand soft of touch and strong of grip beckoned
him  And there was an allurement about it which was as the allurement
of sin

Not that Vance Corliss was anybodys fool nor that his had been an
anchorites existence but that his upbringing rather had given his
life a certain puritanical bent  Awakening intelligence and broader
knowledge had weakened the early influence of an austere mother but
had not wholly eradicated it  It was there deep down very shadowy
but still a part of him  He could not get away from it  It distorted
ever so slightly his concepts of things  It gave a squint to his
perceptions and very often when the sex feminine was concerned
determined his classifications  He prided himself on his largeness
when he granted that there were three kinds of women  His mother had
only admitted two  But he had outgrown her  It was incontestable that
there were three kindsthe good the bad and the partly good and
partly bad  That the last usually went bad he believed firmly  In
its very nature such a condition could not be permanent  It was the
intermediary stage marking the passage from high to low from best to
worst

All of which might have been true even as he saw it but with
definitions for premises conclusions cannot fail to be dogmatic  What
was good and bad  There it was  That was where his mother whispered
with dead lips to him  Nor alone his mother but divers conventional
generations even back to the sturdy ancestor who first uplifted from
the soil and looked down  For Vance Corliss was many times removed
from the red earth and though he did not know it there was a clamor
within him for a return lest he perish

Not that he pigeonholed Frona according to his inherited definitions
He refused to classify her at all  He did not dare  He preferred to
pass judgment later when he had gathered more data  And there was the
allurement the gathering of the data the great critical point where
purity reaches dreamy hands towards pitch and refuses to call it
pitchtill defiled  No Vance Corliss was not a cad  And since
purity is merely a relative term he was not pure  That there was no
pitch under his nails was not because he had manicured diligently but
because it had not been his luck to run across any pitch  He was not
good because he chose to be because evil was repellant but because he
had not had opportunity to become evil  But from this on the other
hand it is not to be argued that he would have gone bad had he had a
chance

He was a product of the sheltered life  All his days had been lived in
a sanitary dwelling the plumbing was excellent  The air he had
breathed had been mostly ozone artificially manufactured  He had been
sunbathed in balmy weather and brought in out of the wet when it
rained  And when he reached the age of choice he had been too fully
occupied to deviate from the straight path along which his mother had
taught him to creep and toddle and along which he now proceeded to
walk upright without thought of what lay on either side

Vitality cannot be used over again  If it be expended on one thing
there is none left for the other thing  And so with Vance Corliss
Scholarly lucubrations and healthy exercises during his college days
had consumed all the energy his normal digestion extracted from a
wholesome omnivorous diet  When he did discover a bit of surplus
energy he worked it off in the society of his mother and of the
conventional minds and prim teas she surrounded herself with  Result
A very nice young man of whom no maids mother need ever be in
trepidation a very strong young man whose substance had not been
wasted in riotous living a very learned young man with a Freiberg
mining engineers diploma and a BA sheepskin from Yale and lastly
a very selfcentred selfpossessed young man

Now his greatest virtue lay in this he had not become hardened in the
mould baked by his several forbears and into which he had been pressed
by his mothers hands  Some atavism had been at work in the making of
him and he had reverted to that ancestor who sturdily uplifted  But
so far this portion of his heritage had lain dormant  He had simply
remained adjusted to a stable environment  There had been no call upon
the adaptability which was his  But whensoever the call came being so
constituted it was manifest that he should adapt should adjust
himself to the unwonted pressure of new conditions  The maxim of the
rolling stone may be all true but notwithstanding in the scheme of
life the inability to become fixed is an excellence par excellence
Though he did not know it this inability was Vance Corlisss most
splendid possession

But to return  He looked forward with great sober glee to meeting
Frona Welse and in the meanwhile consulted often the sunpicture he
carried of her  Though he went over the Pass and down the lakes and
river with a push of money behind him London syndicates are never
niggardly in such matters  Frona beat him into Dawson by a fortnight
While on his part money in the end overcame obstacles on hers the name
of Welse was a talisman greater than treasure  After his arrival a
couple of weeks were consumed in buying a cabin presenting his letters
of introduction and settling down  But all things come in the fulness
of time and so one night after the river closed he pointed his
moccasins in the direction of Jacob Welses house  Mrs Schoville the
Gold Commissioners wife gave him the honor of her company


Corliss wanted to rub his eyes  Steamheating apparatus in the
Klondike  But the next instant he had passed out of the hall through
the heavy portieres and stood inside the drawingroom  And it was a
drawingroom  His moosehide moccasins sank luxuriantly into the deep
carpet and his eyes were caught by a Turner sunrise on the opposite
wall  And there were other paintings and things in bronze  Two Dutch
fireplaces were roaring full with huge backlogs of spruce  There was
a piano and somebody was singing  Frona sprang from the stool and
came forward greeting him with both hands  He had thought his
sunpicture perfect but this firepicture this young creature with
the flush and warmth of ringing life quite eclipsed it  It was a
whirling moment as he held her two hands in his one of those moments
when an incomprehensible orgasm quickens the blood and dizzies the
brain  Though the first syllables came to him faintly Mrs
Schovilles voice brought him back to himself

Oh she cried  You know him

And Frona answered Yes we met on the Dyea Trail and those who meet
on the Dyea Trail can never forget

How romantic

The Gold Commissioners wife clapped her hands  Though fat and forty
and phlegmatic of temperament between exclamations and handclappings
her waking existence was mostly explosive  Her husband secretly
averred that did God Himself deign to meet her face to face she would
smite together her chubby hands and cry out How romantic

How did it happen she continued  He didnt rescue you over a
cliff or that sort of thing did he  Do say that he did  And you
never said a word about it Mr Corliss  Do tell me  Im just dying
to know

Oh nothing like that he hastened to answer  Nothing much  I
that is we

He felt a sinking as Frona interrupted  There was no telling what this
remarkable girl might say

He gave me of his hospitality that was all she said  And I can
vouch for his fried potatoes while for his coffee it is
excellentwhen one is very hungry

Ingrate he managed to articulate and thereby to gain a smile ere
he was introduced to a cleanly built lieutenant of the Mounted Police
who stood by the fireplace discussing the grub proposition with a
dapper little man very much out of place in a white shirt and stiff
collar

Thanks to the particular niche in society into which he happened to be
born Corliss drifted about easily from group to group and was much
envied therefore by Del Bishop who sat stiffly in the first chair he
had dropped into and who was waiting patiently for the first person to
take leave that he might know how to compass the manoeuvre  In his
minds eye he had figured most of it out knew just how many steps
required to carry him to the door was certain he would have to say
goodby to Frona but did not know whether or not he was supposed to
shake hands all around  He had just dropped in to see Frona and say
Howdee as he expressed it and had unwittingly found himself in
company

Corliss having terminated a buzz with a Miss Mortimer on the decadence
of the French symbolists encountered Del Bishop  But the pocketminer
remembered him at once from the one glimpse he had caught of Corliss
standing by his tentdoor in Happy Camp  Was almighty obliged to him
for his nights hospitality to Miss Frona seein as hed ben
sidetracked down the line that any kindness to her was a kindness to
him and that hed remember it by God as long as he had a corner of a
blanket to pull over him  Hoped it hadnt put him out  Miss Fronad
said that bedding was scarce but it wasnt a cold night more blowy
than crisp so he reckoned there couldnt a ben much shiverin  All
of which struck Corliss as perilous and he broke away at the first
opportunity leaving the pocketminer yearning for the door

But Dave Harney who had not come by mistake avoided gluing himself to
the first chair  Being an Eldorado king he had felt it incumbent to
assume the position in society to which his numerous millions entitled
him and though unused all his days to social amenities other than the
outhanging latchstring and the general pot he had succeeded to his
own satisfaction as a knight of the carpet  Quick to take a cue he
circulated with an aplomb which his striking garments and long
shambling gait only heightened and talked choppy and disconnected
fragments with whomsoever he ran up against  The Miss Mortimer who
spoke Parisian French took him aback with her symbolists but he
evened matters up with a goodly measure of the bastard lingo of the
Canadian voyageurs and left her gasping and meditating over a
proposition to sell him twentyfive pounds of sugar white or brown
But she was not unduly favored for with everybody he adroitly turned
the conversation to grub and then led up to the eternal proposition
Sugar or bust he would conclude gayly each time and wander on to the
next

But he put the capstone on his social success by asking Frona to sing
the touching ditty I Left My Happy Home for You  This was something
beyond her though she had him hum over the opening bars so that she
could furnish the accompaniment  His voice was more strenuous than
sweet and Del Bishop discovering himself at last joined in raucously
on the choruses  This made him feel so much better that he
disconnected himself from the chair and when he finally got home he
kicked up his sleepy tentmate to tell him about the high time hed had
over at the Welses  Mrs Schoville tittered and thought it all so
unique and she thought it so unique several times more when the
lieutenant of Mounted Police and a couple of compatriots roared Rule
Britannia and God Save the Queen and the Americans responded with
My Country Tis of Thee and John Brown  Then big Alec Beaubien
the Circle City king demanded the Marseillaise and the company
broke up chanting Die Wacht am Rhein to the frosty night

Dont come on these nights Frona whispered to Corliss at parting
We havent spoken three words and I know we shall be good friends
Did Dave Harney succeed in getting any sugar out of you

They mingled their laughter and Corliss went home under the aurora
borealis striving to reduce his impressions to some kind of order




CHAPTER VIII

And why should I not be proud of my race

Fronas cheeks were flushed and her eyes sparkling  They had both been
harking back to childhood and she had been telling Corliss of her
mother whom she faintly remembered  Fair and flaxenhaired typically
Saxon was the likeness she had drawn filled out largely with
knowledge gained from her father and from old Andy of the Dyea Post
The discussion had then turned upon the race in general and Frona had
said things in the heat of enthusiasm which affected the more
conservative mind of Corliss as dangerous and not solidly based on
fact  He deemed himself too large for race egotism and insular
prejudice and had seen fit to laugh at her immature convictions

Its a common characteristic of all peoples he proceeded to
consider themselves superior racesa naive natural egoism very
healthy and very good but none the less manifestly untrue  The Jews
conceived themselves to be Gods chosen people and they still so
conceive themselves

And because of it they have left a deep mark down the page of
history she interrupted

But time has not proved the stability of their conceptions  And you
must also view the other side  A superior people must look upon all
others as inferior peoples  This comes home to you  To be a Roman
were greater than to be a king and when the Romans rubbed against your
savage ancestors in the German forests they elevated their brows and
said An inferior people barbarians

But we are here now  We are and the Romans are not  The test is
time  So far we have stood the test the signs are favorable that we
shall continue to stand it  We are the best fitted

Egotism

But wait  Put it to the test

As she spoke her hand flew out impulsively to his  At the touch his
heart pulsed upward there was a rush Of blood and a tightening across
the temples  Ridiculous but delightful he thought  At this rate he
could argue with her the night through

The test she repeated withdrawing her hand without embarrassment
We are a race of doers and fighters of globeencirclers and
zoneconquerors  We toil and struggle and stand by the toil and
struggle no matter how hopeless it may be  While we are persistent and
resistant we are so made that we fit ourselves to the most diverse
conditions  Will the Indian the Negro or the Mongol ever conquer the
Teuton  Surely not  The Indian has persistence without variability
if he does not modify he dies if he does try to modify he dies anyway
The Negro has adaptability but he is servile and must be led  As for
the Chinese they are permanent  All that the other races are not the
AngloSaxon or Teuton if you please is  All that the other races
have not the Teuton has  What race is to rise up and overwhelm us

Ah you forget the Slav Corliss suggested slyly

The Slav  Her face fell  True the Slav  The only stripling in
this world of young men and graybeards  But he is still in the
future and in the future the decision rests  In the mean time we
prepare  If may be we shall have such a start that we shall prevent
him growing  You know because he was better skilled in chemistry
knew how to manufacture gunpowder that the Spaniard destroyed the
Aztec  May not we who are possessing ourselves of the world and its
resources and gathering to ourselves all its knowledge may not we nip
the Slav ere he grows a thatch to his lip

Vance Corliss shook his head noncommittally and laughed

Oh  I know I become absurd and grow overwarm she exclaimed  But
after all one reason that we are the salt of the earth is because we
have the courage to say so

And I am sure your warmth spreads he responded  See Im beginning
to glow myself  We are not Gods but Natures chosen people we
Angles and Saxons and Normans and Vikings and the earth is our
heritage  Let us arise and go forth

Now you are laughing at me and besides we have already gone forth
Why have you fared into the north if not to lay hands on the race
legacy


She turned her head at the sound of approaching footsteps and cried
for greeting I appeal to you Captain Alexander  I summon you to
bear witness

The captain of police smiled in his sternly mirthful fashion as he
shook hands with Frona and Corliss  Bear witness he questioned
Ah yes

  Bear witness O my comrades what a hardbit gang were we
  The servants of the sweephead but the masters of the sea

He quoted the verse with a savage solemnity exulting through his deep
voice  This and the appositeness of it quite carried Frona away and
she had both his hands in hers on the instant  Corliss was aware of an
inward wince at the action  It was uncomfortable  He did not like to
see her so promiscuous with those warm strong hands of hers  Did she
so favor all men who delighted her by word or deed  He did not mind
her fingers closing round his but somehow it seemed wanton when shared
with the next comer  By the time he had thought thus far Frona had
explained the topic under discussion and Captain Alexander was
testifying

I dont know much about your Slav and other kin except that they are
good workers and strong but I do know that the white man is the
greatest and best breed in the world  Take the Indian for instance
The white man comes along and beats him at all his games outworks him
outroughs him outfishes him outhunts him  As far back as their
myths go the Alaskan Indians have packed on their backs  But the
goldrushers as soon as they had learned the tricks of the trade
packed greater loads and packed them farther than did the Indians
Why last May the Queens birthday we had sports on the river  In
the one two three four and five men canoe races we beat the Indians
right and left  Yet they had been born to the paddle and most of us
had never seen a canoe until mangrown

But why is it Corliss queried

I do not know why  I only know that it is  I simply bear witness  I
do know that we do what they cannot do and what they can do we do
better

Frona nodded her head triumphantly at Corliss  Come acknowledge your
defeat so that we may go in to dinner  Defeat for the time being at
least  The concrete facts of paddles and packstraps quite overcome
your dogmatics  Ah I thought so  More time  All the time in the
world  But let us go in  Well see what my father thinks of itand
Mr Kellar  A symposium on AngloSaxon supremacy


Frost and enervation are mutually repellant  The Northland gives a
keenness and zest to the blood which cannot be obtained in warmer
climes  Naturally so then the friendship which sprang up between
Corliss and Frona was anything but languid  They met often under her
fathers rooftree and went many places together  Each found a
pleasurable attraction in the other and a satisfaction which the
things they were not in accord with could not mar  Frona liked the man
because he was a man  In her wildest flights she could never imagine
linking herself with any man no matter how exalted spiritually who
was not a man physically  It was a delight to her and a joy to look
upon the strong males of her kind with bodies comely in the sight of
God and muscles swelling with the promise of deeds and work  Man to
her was preeminently a fighter  She believed in natural selection and
in sexual selection and was certain that if man had thereby become
possessed of faculties and functions they were for him to use and
could but tend to his good  And likewise with instincts  If she felt
drawn to any person or thing it was good for her to be so drawn good
for herself  If she felt impelled to joy in a wellbuilt frame and
wellshaped muscle why should she restrain  Why should she not love
the body and without shame  The history of the race and of all
races sealed her choice with approval  Down all time the weak and
effeminate males had vanished from the worldstage   Only the strong
could inherit the earth  She had been born of the strong and she
chose to cast her lot with the strong

Yet of all creatures she was the last to be deaf and blind to the
things of the spirit  But the things of the spirit she demanded should
be likewise strong  No halting no stuttered utterance tremulous
waiting minor wailing  The mind and the soul must be as quick and
definite and certain as the body  Nor was the spirit made alone for
immortal dreaming  Like the flesh it must strive and toil  It must
be workaday as well as idle day  She could understand a weakling
singing sweetly and even greatly and in so far she could love him for
his sweetness and greatness but her love would have fuller measure
were he strong of body as well  She believed she was just  She gave
the flesh its due and the spirit its due but she had over and above
her own choice her own individual ideal  She liked to see the two go
hand in hand  Prophecy and dyspepsia did not affect her as a
felicitous admixture  A splendid savage and a weakkneed poet  She
could admire the one for his brawn and the other for his song but she
would prefer that they had been made one in the beginning

As to Vance Corliss  First and most necessary of all there was that
physiological affinity between them that made the touch of his hand a
pleasure to her  Though souls may rush together if body cannot endure
body happiness is reared on sand and the structure will be ever
unstable and tottery  Next Corliss had the physical potency of the
hero without the grossness of the brute  His muscular development was
more qualitative than quantitative and it is the qualitative
development which gives rise to beauty of form  A giant need not be
proportioned in the mould nor a thew be symmetrical to be massive

And finallynone the less necessary but still finallyVance Corliss
was neither spiritually dead nor decadent  He affected her as fresh
and wholesome and strong as reared above the soil but not scorning the
soil  Of course none of this she reasoned out otherwise than by
subconscious processes  Her conclusions were feelings not thoughts

Though they quarrelled and disagreed on innumerable things deep down
underlying all there was a permanent unity  She liked him for a
certain stern soberness that was his and for his saving grace of
humor  Seriousness and banter were not incompatible  She liked him
for his gallantry made to work with and not for display  She liked
the spirit of his offer at Happy Camp when he proposed giving her an
Indian guide and passagemoney back to the United States  He could
do as well as talk  She liked him for his outlook for his innate
liberality which she felt to be there somehow no matter that often
he was narrow of expression  She liked him for his mind  Though
somewhat academic somewhat tainted with latterday scholasticism it
was still a mind which permitted him to be classed with the
Intellectuals  He was capable of divorcing sentiment and emotion
from reason  Granted that he included all the factors he could not go
wrong  And here was where she found chief fault with himhis
narrowness which precluded all the factors his narrowness which gave
the lie to the breadth she knew was really his  But she was aware that
it was not an irremediable defect and that the new life he was leading
was very apt to rectify it  He was filled with culture what he needed
was a few more of lifes facts

And she liked him for himself which is quite different from liking the
parts which went to compose him  For it is no miracle for two things
added together to produce not only the sum of themselves but a third
thing which is not to be found in either of them  So with him  She
liked him for himself for that something which refused to stand out as
a part or a sum of parts for that something which is the cornerstone
of Faith and which has ever baffled Philosophy and Science  And
further to like with Frona Welse did not mean to love

First and above all Vance Corliss was drawn to Frona Welse because of
the clamor within him for a return to the soil  In him the elements
were so mixed that it was impossible for women many times removed to
find favor in his eyes  Such he had met constantly but not one had
ever drawn from him a superfluous heartbeat  Though there had been in
him a growing instinctive knowledge of lack of unitythe lack of
unity which must precede always the love of man and womannot one
of the daughters of Eve he had met had flashed irresistibly in to fill
the void  Elective affinity sexual affinity or whatsoever the
intangible essence known as love is had never been manifest  When he
met Frona it had at once sprung fullfledged into existence  But he
quite misunderstood it took it for a mere attraction towards the new
and unaccustomed

Many men possessed of birth and breeding have yielded to this clamor
for return  And giving the apparent lie to their own sanity and moral
stability many such men have married peasant girls or barmaids  And
those to whom evil apportioned itself have been prone to distrust the
impulse they obeyed forgetting that nature makes or mars the
individual for the sake always of the type  For in every such case
of return the impulse was soundonly that time and space interfered
and propinquity determined whether the object of choice should be
barmaid or peasant girl


Happily for Vance Corliss time and space were propitious and in Frona
he found the culture he could not do without and the clean sharp tang
of the earth he needed  In so far as her education and culture went
she was an astonishment  He had met the scientifically smattered young
woman before but Frona had something more than smattering  Further
she gave new life to old facts and her interpretations of common
things were coherent and vigorous and new  Though his acquired
conservatism was alarmed and cried danger he could not remain cold to
the charm of her philosophizing while her scholarly attainments were
fully redeemed by her enthusiasm  Though he could not agree with much
that she passionately held he yet recognized that the passion of
sincerity and enthusiasm was good

But her chief fault in his eyes was her unconventionality  Woman was
something so inexpressibly sacred to him that he could not bear to see
any good woman venturing where the footing was precarious  Whatever
good woman thus ventured overstepping the metes and bounds of sex and
status he deemed did so of wantonness  And wantonness of such order
was akin towell he could not say it when thinking of Frona though
she hurt him often by her unwise acts  However he only felt such
hurts when away from her  When with her looking into her eyes which
always looked back or at greeting and parting pressing her hand which
always pressed honestly it seemed certain that there was in her
nothing but goodness and truth

And then he liked her in many different ways for many different things
For her impulses and for her passions which were always elevated  And
already from breathing the Northland air he had come to like her for
that comradeship which at first had shocked him  There were other
acquired likings her lack of prudishness for instance which he awoke
one day to find that he had previously confounded with lack of modesty
And it was only the day before that day that he drifted before he
thought into a discussion with her of Camille  She had seen
Bernhardt and dwelt lovingly on the recollection  He went home
afterwards a dull pain gnawing at his heart striving to reconcile
Frona with the ideal impressed upon him by his mother that innocence
was another term for ignorance  Notwithstanding by the following day
he had worked it out and loosened another finger of the maternal grip

He liked the flame of her hair in the sunshine the glint of its gold
by the firelight and the waywardness of it and the glory  He liked
her neatshod feet and the graygaitered calvesalas now hidden in
longskirted Dawson  He liked her for the strength of her slenderness
and to walk with her swinging her step and stride to his or to merely
watch her come across a room or down the street was a delight  Life
and the joy of life romped through her blood abstemiously filling out
and rounding off each shapely muscle and soft curve  And he liked it
all  Especially he liked the swell of her forearm which rose firm and
strong and tantalizing and sought shelter all too quickly under the
looseflowing sleeve

The coordination of physical with spiritual beauty is very strong in
normal men and so it was with Vance Corliss  That he liked the one
was no reason that he failed to appreciate the other  He liked Frona
for both and for herself as well  And to like with him though he
did not know it was to love




CHAPTER IX

Vance Corliss proceeded at a fair rate to adapt himself to the
Northland life and he found that many adjustments came easy  While
his own tongue was alien to the brimstone of the Lord he became quite
used to strong language on the part of other men even in the most
genial conversation  Carthey a little Texan who went to work for him
for a while opened or closed every second sentence on an average
with the mild expletive By damn  It was also his invariable way of
expressing surprise disappointment consternation or all the rest of
the tribe of sudden emotions  By pitch and stress and intonation the
protean oath was made to perform every function of ordinary speech  At
first it was a constant source of irritation and disgust to Corliss
but erelong he grew not only to tolerate it but to like it and to
wait for it eagerly  Once Cartheys wheeldog lost an ear in a hasty
contention with a dog of the Hudson Bay and when the young fellow bent
over the animal and discovered the loss the blended endearment and
pathos of the by damn which fell from his lips was a relation to
Corliss  All was not evil out of Nazareth he concluded sagely and
like Jacob Welse of old revised his philosophy of life accordingly

Again there were two sides to the social life of Dawson  Up at the
Barracks at the Welses and a few other places all men of standing
were welcomed and made comfortable by the womenkind of like standing
There were teas and dinners and dances and socials for charity and
the usual run of things all of which however failed to wholly
satisfy the men  Down in the town there was a totally different though
equally popular other side  As the country was too young for
clublife the masculine portion of the community expressed its
masculinity by herding together in the saloonsthe ministers and
missionaries being the only exceptions to this mode of expression
Business appointments and deals were made and consummated in the
saloons enterprises projected shop talked the latest news discussed
and a general good fellowship maintained  There all life rubbed
shoulders and kings and dogdrivers oldtimers and chechaquos met on
a common level  And it so happened probably because sawmills and
housespace were scarce that the saloons accommodated the gambling
tables and the polished dancehouse floors  And here because he needs
must bend to custom Corlisss adaptation went on rapidly  And as
Carthey who appreciated him soliloquized The best of it is he likes
it damn well by damn

But any adjustment must have its painful periods and while Corlisss
general change went on smoothly in the particular case of Frona it was
different  She had a code of her own quite unlike that of the
community and perhaps believed woman might do things at which even the
salooninhabiting males would be shocked  And because of this she and
Corliss had their first disagreeable disagreement

Frona loved to run with the dogs through the biting frost cheeks
tingling blood bounding body thrust forward and limbs rising and
falling ceaselessly to the pace  And one November day with the first
cold snap on and the spirit thermometer frigidly marking sixtyfive
below she got out the sled harnessed her team of huskies and flew
down the river trail  As soon as she cleared the town she was off and
running  And in such manner running and riding by turns she swept
through the Indian village below the bluffs made an eightmile circle
up Moosehide Creek and back crossed the river on the ice and several
hours later came flying up the west bank of the Yukon opposite the
town  She was aiming to tap and return by the trail for the woodsleds
which crossed thereabout but a mile away from it she ran into the soft
snow and brought the winded dogs to a walk

Along the rim of the river and under the frown of the overhanging
cliffs she directed the path she was breaking  Here and there she
made detours to avoid the outjutting talus and at other times
followed the ice in against the precipitous walls and hugged them
closely around the abrupt bends  And so at the head of her huskies
she came suddenly upon a woman sitting in the snow and gazing across
the river at smokecanopied Dawson  She had been crying and this was
sufficient to prevent Fronas scrutiny from wandering farther  A tear
turned to a globule of ice rested on her cheek and her eyes were dim
and moist there was anexpression of hopeless fathomless woe

Oh Frona cried stopping the dogs and coming up to her  You are
hurt  Can I help you she queried though the stranger shook her
head  But you mustnt sit there  It is nearly seventy below and
youll freeze in a few minutes  Your cheeks are bitten already  She
rubbed the afflicted parts vigorously with a mitten of snow and then
looked down on the warm returning glow

I beg pardon  The woman rose somewhat stiffly to her feet  And I
thank you but I am perfectly warm you see settling the fur cape
more closely about her with a snuggling movement and I had just sat
down for the moment

Frona noted that she was very beautiful and her womans eye roved over
and took in the splendid furs the make of the gown and the beadwork
of the moccasins which peeped from beneath  And in view of all this
and of the fact that the face was unfamiliar she felt an instinctive
desire to shrink back

And I havent hurt myself the woman went on  Just a mood that was
all looking out over the dreary endless white

Yes Frona replied mastering herself I can understand  There must
be much of sadness in such a landscape only it never comes that way to
me  The sombreness and the sternness of it appeal to me but not the
sadness

And that is because the lines of our lives have been laid in different
places the other ventured reflectively  It is not what the
landscape is but what we are  If we were not the landscape would
remain but without human significance  That is what we invest it with

  Truth is within ourselves it takes no rise
  From outward things whateer you may believe

Fronas eyes brightened and she went on to complete the passage

  There is an inmost centre in us all
  Where truth abides in fulness and around

Andandhow does it go  I have forgotten

  Wall upon wall the gross flesh hems it in

The woman ceased abruptly her voice trilling off into silvery laughter
with a certain bitter reckless ring to it which made Frona inwardly
shiver  She moved as though to go back to her dogs but the womans
hand went out in a familiar gesturetwin to Fronas ownwhich went
at once to Fronas heart

Stay a moment she said with an undertone of pleading in the words
and talk with me  It is long since I have met a womanshe paused
while her tongue wandered for the wordwho could quote Paracelsus
You areI know you you seeyou are Jacob Welses daughter Frona
Welse I believe

Frona nodded her identity hesitated and looked at the woman with
secret intentness  She was conscious of a great and pardonable
curiosity of a frank outreaching for fuller knowledge  This
creature so like so different old as the oldest race and young as
the last rosetinted babe flung far as the farthermost fires of men
and eternal as humanity itselfwhere were they unlike this woman and
she  Her five senses told her not by every law of life they were no
only only by the fastdrawn lines of social caste and social wisdom
were they not the same  So she thought even as for one searching
moment she studied the others face  And in the situation she found an
uplifting awfulness such as comes when the veil is thrust aside and
one gazes on the mysteriousness of Deity  She remembered Her feet
take hold of hell her house is the way to the grave going down to the
chamber of death and in the same instant strong upon her was the
vision of the familiar gesture with which the womans hand had gone out
in mute appeal and she looked aside out over the dreary endless
white and for her too the day became filled with sadness

She gave an involuntary halfnervous shiver though she said
naturally enough Come let us walk on and get the blood moving again
I had no idea it was so cold till I stood still  She turned to the
dogs Mushon  King  You Sandy  Mush  And back again to the
woman I am quite chilled and as for you you must be

Quite warm of course  You have been running and your clothes are wet
against you while I have kept up the needful circulation and no more
I saw you when you leaped off the sled below the hospital and vanished
down the river like a Diana of the snows  How I envied you  You must
enjoy it

Oh I do Frona answered simply  I was raised with the dogs

It savors of the Greek

Frona did not reply and they walked on in silence  Yet Frona wished
though she dared not dare that she could give her tongue free rein
and from out of the others bitter knowledge for her own souls sake
and sanity draw the pregnant human generalizations which she must
possess  And over her welled a wave of pity and distress and she felt
a discomfort for she knew not what to say or how to voice her heart
And when the others speech broke forth she hailed it with a great
relief

Tell me the woman demanded halfeagerly halfmasterly tell me
about yourself  You are new to the Inside  Where were you before you
came in  Tell me

So the difficulty was solved in a way and Frona talked on about
herself with a successfully feigned girlhood innocence as though she
did not appreciate the other or understand her illconcealed yearning
for that which she might not have but which was Fronas

There is the trail you are trying to connect with  They had rounded
the last of the cliffs and Fronas companion pointed ahead to where
the walls receded and wrinkled to a gorge out of which the sleds drew
the firewood across the river to town  I shall leave you there she
concluded

But are you not going back to Dawson Frona queried  It is growing
late and you had better not linger

No     I   

Her painful hesitancy brought Frona to a realization of her own
thoughtlessness  But she had made the step and she knew she could not
retrace it

We will go back together she said bravely  And in candid
allknowledge of the other I do not mind

Then it was that the blood surged into the womans cold face and her
hand went out to the girl in the old old way

No no I beg of you she stammered  I beg of you     I     I
prefer to continue my walk a little farther  See  Some one is coming
now

By this time they had reached the woodtrail and Fronas face was
flaming as the others had flamed  A light sled dogs alope and
swinging down out of the gorge was just upon them  A man was running
with the team and he waved his hand to the two women

Vance Frona exclaimed as he threw his leaddogs in the snow and
brought the sled to a halt  What are you doing over here  Is the
syndicate bent upon cornering the firewood also

No  Were not so bad as that  His face was full of smiling
happiness at the meeting as he shook hands with her  But Carthey is
leaving megoing prospecting somewhere around the North Pole I
believeand I came across to look up Del Bishop if hell serve

He turned his head to glance expectantly at her companion and she saw
the smile go out of his face and anger come in  Frona was helplessly
aware that she had no grip over the situation and though a rebellion
at the cruelty and injustice of it was smouldering somewhere deep down
she could only watch the swift culmination of the little tragedy  The
woman met his gaze with a halfshrinking as from an impending blow
and with a softness of expression which entreated pity  But he
regarded her long and coldly then deliberately turned his back  As he
did this Frona noted her face go tired and gray and the hardness and
recklessness of her laughter were there painted in harsh tones and a
bitter devil rose up and lurked in her eyes  It was evident that the
same bitter devil rushed hotly to her tongue  But it chanced just then
that she glanced at Frona and all expression was brushed from her face
save the infinite tiredness  She smiled wistfully at the girl and
without a word turned and went down the trail

And without a word Frona sprang upon her sled and was off  The way was
wide and Corliss swung in his dogs abreast of hers  The smouldering
rebellion flared up and she seemed to gather to herself some of the
womans recklessness

You brute

The words left her mouth sharp clearcut breaking the silence like
the lash of a whip  The unexpectedness of it and the savagery took
Corliss aback  He did not know what to do or say

Oh you coward  You coward

Frona  Listen to me

But she cut him off  No  Do not speak  You can have nothing to say
You have behaved abominably  I am disappointed in you  It is
horrible horrible

Yes it was horriblehorrible that she should walk with you have
speech with you be seen with you

Not until the sun excludes you do I exclude you she flung back at
him

But there is a fitness of things

Fitness She turned upon him and loosed her wrath  If she is unfit
are you fit  May you cast the first stone with that smugly
sanctimonious air of yours

You shall not talk to me in this fashion  Ill not have it

He clutched at her sled and even in the midst of her anger she noticed
it with a little thrill of pleasure

Shall not  You coward

He reached out as though to lay hands upon her and she raised her
coiled whip to strike  But to his credit he never flinched his white
face calmly waited to receive the blow  Then she deflected the stroke
and the long lash hissed out and fell among the dogs  Swinging the
whip briskly she rose to her knees on the sled and called frantically
to the animals  Hers was the better team and she shot rapidly away
from Corliss  She wished to get away not so much from him as from
herself and she encouraged the huskies into wilder and wilder speed
She took the steep riverbank in full career and dashed like a
whirlwind through the town and home  Never in her life had she been in
such a condition never had she experienced such terrible anger  And
not only was she already ashamed but she was frightened and afraid of
herself




CHAPTER X

The next morning Corliss was knocked out of a late bed by Bash one of
Jacob Welses Indians  He was the bearer of a brief little note from
Frona which contained a request for the mining engineer to come and
see her at his first opportunity  That was all that was said and he
pondered over it deeply  What did she wish to say to him  She was
still such an unknown quantityand never so much as now in the light
of the day beforethat he could not guess  Did she desire to give
him his dismissal on a definite wellunderstood basis  To take
advantage of her sex and further humiliate him  To tell him what she
thought of him in coolly considered coldmeasured terms  Or was she
penitently striving to make amends for the unmerited harshness she had
dealt him  There was neither contrition nor anger in the note no
clew nothing save a formally worded desire to see him

So it was in a rather unsettled and curious frame of mind that he
walked in upon her as the last hour of the morning drew to a close  He
was neither on his dignity nor off his attitude being strictly
noncommittal against the moment she should disclose hers  But without
beating about the bush in that way of hers which he had come already
to admire she at once showed her colors and came frankly forward to
him  The first glimpse of her face told him the first feel of her
hand before she had said a word told him that all was well

I am glad you have come she began  I could not be at peace with
myself until I had seen you and told you how sorry I am for yesterday
and how deeply ashamed I

There there  Its not so bad as all that  They were still
standing and he took a step nearer to her  I assure you I can
appreciate your side of it and though looking at it theoretically it
was the highest conduct demanding the fullest meed of praise still
in all frankness there is much toto

Yes

Much to deplore in it from the social standpoint  And unhappily we
cannot leave the social standpoint out of our reckoning  But so far
as I may speak for myself you have done nothing to feel sorry for or
be ashamed of

It is kind of you she cried graciously  Only it is not true and
you know it is not true  You know that you acted for the best you
know that I hurt you insulted you you know that I behaved like a
fishwife and you do know that I disgusted you

No no  He raised his hand as though to ward from her the blows she
dealt herself

But yes yes  And I have all reason in the world to be ashamed  I
can only say this in defence the woman had affected me deeplyso
deeply that I was close to weeping  Then you came on the sceneyou
know what you didand the sorrow for her bred an indignation against
you andwell I worked myself into a nervous condition such as I had
never experienced in my life  It was hysteria I suppose  Anyway I
was not myself

We were neither of us ourselves

Now you are untrue  I did wrong but you were yourself as much so
then as now  But do be seated  Here we stand as though you were ready
to run away at first sign of another outbreak

Surely you are not so terrible he laughed adroitly pulling his
chair into position so that the light fell upon her face

Rather you are not such a coward  I must have been terrible
yesterday  II almost struck you  And you were certainly brave when
the whip hung over you  Why you did not even attempt to raise a hand
and shield yourself

I notice the dogs your whip falls among come nevertheless to lick your
hand and to be petted

Ergo she queried audaciously

Ergo it all depends he equivocated

And notwithstanding I am forgiven

As I hope to be forgiven

Then I am gladonly you have done nothing to be forgiven for  You
acted according to your light and I to mine though it must be
acknowledged that mine casts the broader flare  Ah  I have it
clapping her hands in delight I was not angry with you yesterday nor
did I behave rudely to you or even threaten you  It was utterly
impersonal the whole of it  You simply stood for society for the
type which aroused my indignation and anger and as its
representative you bore the brunt of it  Dont you see

I see and cleverly put only while you escape the charge of
maltreating me yesterday you throw yourself open to it today  You
make me out all that is narrowminded and mean and despicable which is
very unjust  Only a few minutes past I said that your way of looking
at it theoretically considered was irreproachable  But not so when
we include society

But you misunderstand me Vance  Listen  Her hand went out to his
and he was content to listen  I have always upheld that what is is
well  I grant the wisdom of the prevailing social judgment in this
matter  Though I deplore it I grant it for the human is so made
But I grant it socially only  I as an individual choose to regard
such things differently  And as between individuals so minded why
should it not be so regarded  Dont you see  Now I find you guilty
As between you and me yesterday on the river you did not so regard
it  You behaved as narrowmindedly as would have the society you
represent

Then you would preach two doctrines he retaliated  One for the
elect and one for the herd  You would be a democrat in theory and an
aristocrat in practice  In fact the whole stand you are making is
nothing more or less than Jesuitical

I suppose with the next breath you will be contending that all men are
born free and equal with a bundle of natural rights thrown in  You
are going to have Del Bishop work for you by what equal freeborn
right will he work for you or you suffer him to work

No he denied  I should have to modify somewhat the questions of
equality and rights

And if you modify you are lost she exulted  For you can only
modify in the direction of my position which is neither so Jesuitical
nor so harsh as you have defined it  But dont let us get lost in
dialectics  I want to see what I can see so tell me about this woman

Not a very tasteful topic Corliss objected

But I seek knowledge

Nor can it be wholesome knowledge

Frona tapped her foot impatiently and studied him

She is beautiful very beautiful she suggested  Do you not think
so

As beautiful as hell

But still beautiful she insisted

Yes if you will have it so  And she is as cruel and hard and
hopeless as she is beautiful

Yet I came upon her alone by the trail her face softened and tears
in her eyes  And I believe with a womans ken that I saw a side of
her to which you are blind  And so strongly did I see it that when
you appeared my mind was blank to all save the solitary wail Oh the
pity of it  The pity of it  And she is a woman even as I and I
doubt not that we are very much alike  Why she even quoted
Browning

And last week he cut her short in a single sitting she gambled
away thirty thousand of Jack Dorseys dustDorsey with two mortgages
already on his dump  They found him in the snow next morning with one
chamber empty in his revolver

Frona made no reply but walking over to the candle deliberately
thrust her finger into the flame  Then she held it up to Corliss that
he might see the outraged skin red and angry

And so I point the parable  The fire is very good but I misuse it
and I am punished

You forget he objected  The fire works in blind obedience to
natural law  Lucile is a free agent  That which she has chosen to do
that she has done

Nay it is you who forget for just as surely Dorsey was a free agent
But you said Lucile  Is that her name  I wish I knew her better

Corliss winced  Dont  You hurt me when you say such things

And why pray

Becausebecause

Yes

Because I honor woman highly  Frona you have always made a stand for
frankness and I can now advantage by it  It hurts me because of the
honor in which I hold you because I cannot bear to see taint approach
you  Why when I saw you and that woman together on the trail Iyou
cannot understand what I suffered

Taint  There was a tightening about her lips which he did not
notice and a just perceptible lustre of victory lighted her eyes

Yes taintcontamination he reiterated  There are some things
which it were not well for a good woman to understand  One cannot
dabble with mud and remain spotless

That opens the field wide  She clasped and unclasped her hands
gleefully  You have said that her name was Lucile you display a
knowledge of her you have given me facts about her you doubtless
retain many which you dare not give in short if one cannot dabble and
remain spotless how about you

But I am

A man of course  Very good  Because you are a man you may court
contamination  Because I am a woman I may not  Contamination
contaminates does it not  Then you what do you here with me  Out
upon you

Corliss threw up his hands laughingly  I give in  You are too much
for me with your formal logic  I can only fall back on the higher
logic which you will not recognize

Which is

Strength  What man wills for woman that will he have

I take you then on your own ground she rushed on  What of
Lucile  What man has willed that he has had  So you and all men
have willed since the beginning of time  So poor Dorsey willed  You
cannot answer so let me speak something that occurs to me concerning
that higher logic you call strength  I have met it before  I
recognized it in you yesterday on the sleds

In me

In you when you reached out and clutched at me  You could not down
the primitive passion and for that matter you did not know it was
uppermost  But the expression on your face I imagine was very like
that of a womanstealing caveman  Another instant and I am sure you
would have laid violent hands upon me

Then I ask your pardon  I did not dream

There you go spoiling it all  II quite liked you for it  Dont
you remember I too was a cavewoman brandishing the whip over your
head

But I am not done with you yet Sir Doubleface even if you have
dropped out of the battle  Her eyes were sparkling mischievously and
the wee laughtercreases were forming on her cheek  I purpose to
unmask you

As clay in the hands of the potter he responded meekly

Then you must remember several things  At first when I was very
humble and apologetic you made it easier for me by saying that you
could only condemn my conduct on the ground of being socially unwise
Remember

Corliss nodded

Then just after you branded me as Jesuitical I turned the
conversation to Lucile saying that I wished to see what I could see

Again he nodded

And just as I expected I saw  For in only a few minutes you began to
talk about taint and contamination and dabbling in mudand all in
relation to me  There are your two propositions sir  You may only
stand on one and I feel sure that you stand on the last one  Yes I
am right  You do  And you were insincere confess when you found my
conduct unwise only from the social point of view  I like sincerity

Yes he began I was unwittingly insincere  But I did not know it
until further analysis with your help put me straight  Say what you
will Frona my conception of woman is such that she should not court
defilement

But cannot we be as gods knowing good and evil

But we are not gods he shook his head sadly

Only the men are

That is newwomanish talk he frowned  Equal rights the ballot
and all that

Oh  Dont she protested  You wont understand me you cant  I
am no womans rights creature and I stand not for the new woman but
for the new womanhood  Because I am sincere because I desire to be
natural and honest and true and because I am consistent with myself
you choose to misunderstand it all and to lay wrong strictures upon me
I do try to be consistent and I think I fairly succeed but you can
see neither rhyme nor reason in my consistency  Perhaps it is because
you are unused to consistent natural women because more likely you
are only familiar with the hothouse breedspretty helpless
wellrounded stallfatted little things blissfully innocent and
criminally ignorant  They are not natural or strong nor can they
mother the natural and strong

She stopped abruptly  They heard somebody enter the hall and a heavy
softmoccasined tread approaching

We are friends she added hurriedly and Corliss answered with his
eyes

Aint intrudin am I  Dave Harney grinned broad insinuation and
looked about ponderously before coming up to shake hands

Not at all Corliss answered    Weve bored each other till we were
pining for some one to come along  If you hadnt we would soon have
been quarrelling wouldnt we Miss Welse

I dont think he states the situation fairly she smiled back  In
fact we had already begun to quarrel

You do look a mite flustered Harney criticised dropping his
loosejointed frame all over the pillows of the lounging couch

Hows the famine Corliss asked  Any public relief started yet

Wont need any public relief  Miss Fronas old man was too forehanded
fer em  Scairt the daylights out of the critters I do blieve
Three thousand went out over the ice hittin the high places an half
ez many again went down to the caches and the markets loosened some
considerable  Jest what Welse figgered on everybody speculated on a
rise and held all the grub they could lay hand to  That helped scare
the shorts and away they stampeded fer Salt Water the whole caboodle
atakin all the dogs with em  Say he sat up solemnly corner
dogs  Theyll rise suthin unheard on in the spring when freightin
gits brisk  Ive corralled a hundred aready an I figger to clear a
hundred dollars clean on every hide of em

Think so

Think so  I guess yes  Between we three confidential Im startin
a couple of lads down into the Lower Country next week to buy up five
hundred of the best huskies they kin spot  Think so  Ive limbered my
jints too long in the land to git caught nappin

Frona burst out laughing  But you got pinched on the sugar Dave

Oh I dunno he responded complacently  Which reminds me   Ive
got a noospaper an only four weeks old the Seattle
PostIntelligencer

Has the United States and Spain

Not so fast not so fast  The long Yankee waved his arms for
silence cutting off Fronas question which was following fast on that
of Corliss

But have you read it they both demanded

Unh huh every line advertisements an all

Then do tell me Frona began  Has

Now you keep quiet Miss Frona till I tell you about it reglar
That noospaper cost me fifty dollarscaught the man comin in round
the bend above Klondike City an bought it on the spot  The dummy
could agot a hundred fer it easy if hed held on till he made
town

But what does it say  Has

Ez I was sayin that noospaper cost me fifty dollars  Its the only
one that come in  Everybodys jest dyin to hear the noos  So I
invited a select number of em to come here to yer parlors tonight
Miss Frona ez the only likely place an they kin read it out loud by
shifts ez long ez they want or till theyre tiredthat is if youll
let em have the use of the place

Why of course they are welcome  And you are very kind to

He waved her praise away  Jest ez I kalkilated  Now it so happens
ez you said that I was pinched on sugar  So every mothers son and
daughter that gits a squint at that paper tonight got to pony up five
cups of sugar  Savve  Five cupsbig cups white or brown or
cubean Ill take their IOUs an send a boy round to their shacks
the day followin to collect

Fronas face went blank at the telling then the laughter came back
into it  Wont it be jolly  Ill do it if it raises a scandal
Tonight Dave  Sure tonight

Sure  An you git a complimentary you know fer the loan of yer
parlor

But papa must pay his five cups  You must insist upon it Dave

Daves eyes twinkled appreciatively  Ill git it back on him you

chariot

Sugar cart Dave suggested  An tomorrow night Ill take the paper

cracked his huge knuckles boastfully  I aint ben aburnin daylight
sence navigation closed an if they set up all night they wont be up
early enough in the mornin to git ahead of Dave Harneyeven on a
sugar proposition




CHAPTER XI

Over in the corner Vance Corliss leaned against the piano deep in
conversation with Colonel Trethaway  The latter keen and sharp and
wiry for all his white hair and sixtyodd years was as young in
appearance as a man of thirty   A veteran mining engineer with a
record which put him at the head of his profession he represented as
large American interests as Corliss did British  Not only had a
cordial friendship sprung up between them but in a business way they
had already been of large assistance to each other  And it was well
that they should stand togethera pair who held in grip and could
direct at will the potent capital which two nations had contributed to
the development of the land under the Pole

The crowded room was thick with tobacco smoke  A hundred men or so
garbed in furs and warmcolored wools lined the walls and looked on
But the mumble of their general conversation destroyed the spectacular
feature of the scene and gave to it the geniality of common
comradeship  For all its bizarre appearance it was very like the
livingroom of the home when the members of the household come together
after the work of the day  Kerosene lamps and tallow candles glimmered
feebly in the murky atmosphere while large stoves roared their redhot
and whitehot cheer

On the floor a score of couples pulsed rhythmically to the swinging
waltztime music  Starched shirts and frock coats were not  The men
wore their wolf and beaverskin caps with the gaytasselled earflaps
flying free while on their feet were the mooseskin moccasins and
walrushide muclucs of the north  Here and there a woman was in
moccasins though the majority danced in frail ballroom slippers of
silk and satin  At one end of the hall a great open doorway gave
glimpse of another large room where the crowd was even denser  From
this room in the lulls in the music came the pop of corks and the
clink of glasses and as an undertone the steady click and clatter of
chips and roulette balls

The small door at the rear opened and a woman befurred and muffled
came in on a wave of frost  The cold rushed in with her to the warmth
taking form in a misty cloud which hung close to the floor hiding the
feet of the dancers and writhing and twisting until vanquished by the
heat

A veritable frost queen my Lucile Colonel Trethaway addressed her

She tossed her head and laughed and as she removed her capes and
streetmoccasins chatted with him gayly  But of Corliss though he
stood within a yard of her she took no notice  Half a dozen dancing
men were waiting patiently at a little distance till she should have
done with the colonel  The piano and violin played the opening bars of
a schottische and she turned to go but a sudden impulse made Corliss
step up to her  It was wholly unpremeditated he had not dreamed of
doing it

I am very sorry he said

Her eyes flashed angrily as she turned upon him

I mean it he repeated holding out his hand  I am very sorry  I
was a brute and a coward  Will you forgive me

She hesitated and with the wisdom bought of experience searched him
for the ulterior motive  Then her face softened and she took his
hand  A warm mist dimmed her eyes

Thank you she said

But the waiting men had grown impatient and she was whirled away in
the arms of a handsome young fellow conspicuous in a cap of yellow
Siberian wolfskin  Corliss came back to his companion feeling
unaccountably good and marvelling at what he had done

Its a damned shame  The colonels eye still followed Lucile and
Vance understood   Corliss Ive lived my threescore and lived them
well and do you know woman is a greater mystery than ever  Look at
them look at them all  He embraced the whole scene with his eyes
Butterflies bits of light and song and laughter dancing dancing
down the last tailreach of hell  Not only Lucile but the rest of
them  Look at May there with the brow of a Madonna and the tongue of
a gutterdevil  And Myrtlefor all the world one of Gainsboroughs
old English beauties stepped down from the canvas to riot out the
century in Dawsons dancehalls  And Laura there wouldnt she make a
mother  Cant you see the child in the curve of her arm against her
breast  Theyre the best of the boiling I knowa new country always
gathers the bestbut theres something wrong Corliss something
wrong  The heats of life have passed with me and my vision is truer
surer  It seems a new Christ must arise and preach a new
salvationeconomic or sociologicin these latter days it matters
not so long as it is preached  The world has need of it

The room was wont to be swept by sudden tides and notably between the
dances when the revellers ebbed through the great doorway to where
corks popped and glasses tinkled  Colonel Trethaway and Corliss
followed out on the next ebb to the bar where fifty men and women were
lined up  They found themselves next to Lucile and the fellow in the
yellow wolfskin cap  He was undeniably handsome and his looks were
enhanced by a warm overplus of blood in the cheeks and a certain mellow
fire in the eyes  He was not technically drunk for he had himself in
perfect physical control but his was the soulexhilaration which comes
of the juice of the grape  His voice was raised the least bit and
joyous and his tongue made quick and wittyjust in the unstable
condition when vices and virtues are prone to extravagant expression

As he raised his glass the man next to him accidentally jostled his
arm  He shook the wine from his sleeve and spoke his mind  It was not
a nice word but one customarily calculated to rouse the fighting
blood  And the other mans blood roused for his fist landed under the
wolfskin cap with force sufficient to drive its owner back against
Corliss  The insulted man followed up his attack swiftly   The women
slipped away leaving a free field for the men some of whom were for
crowding in and some for giving room and fair play

The wolfskin cap did not put up a fight or try to meet the wrath he
had invoked but with his hands shielding his face strove to retreat
The crowd called upon him to stand up and fight  He nerved himself to
the attempt but weakened as the man closed in on him and dodged away

Let him alone  He deserves it the colonel called to Vance as he
showed signs of interfering  He wont fight  If he did I think I
could almost forgive him

But I cant see him pummelled Vance objected  If he would only
stand up it wouldnt seem so brutal

The blood was streaming from his nose and from a slight cut over one
eye when Corliss sprang between  He attempted to hold the two men
apart but pressing too hard against the truculent individual
overbalanced him and threw him to the floor  Every man has friends in
a barroom fight and before Vance knew what was taking place he was
staggered by a blow from a chum of the man he had downed  Del Bishop
who had edged in let drive promptly at the man who had attacked his
employer and the fight became general  The crowd took sides on the
moment and went at it

Colonel Trethaway forgot that the heats of life had passed and
swinging a threelegged stool danced nimbly into the fray  A couple
of mounted police on liberty joined him and with half a dozen others
safeguarded the man with the wolfskin cap

Fierce though it was and noisy it was purely a local disturbance  At
the far end of the bar the barkeepers still dispensed drinks and in
the next room the music was on and the dancers afoot  The gamblers
continued their play and at only the near tables did they evince any
interest in the affair

Knockm down an dragm out Del Bishop grinned as he fought for a
brief space shoulder to shoulder with Corliss

Corliss grinned back met the rush of a stalwart dogdriver with a
clinch and came down on top of him among the stamping feet  He was
drawn close and felt the fellows teeth sinking into his ear  Like a
flash he surveyed his whole future and saw himself going oneeared
through life and in the same dash as though inspired his thumbs flew
to the mans eyes and pressed heavily on the balls  Men fell over him
and trampled upon him but it all seemed very dim and far away  He
only knew as he pressed with his thumbs that the mans teeth wavered
reluctantly  He added a little pressure a little more and the man
would have been eyeless and the teeth slackened and slipped their
grip

After that as he crawled out of the fringe of the melee and came to
his feet by the side of the bar all distaste for fighting left him
He had found that he was very much like other men after all and the
imminent loss of part of his anatomy had scraped off twenty years of
culture  Gambling without stakes is an insipid amusement and Corliss
discovered likewise that the warm blood which rises from hygienic
gymnasium work is something quite different from that which pounds
hotly along when thew matches thew and flesh impacts on flesh and the
stake is life and limb  As he dragged himself to his feet by means of
the barrail he saw a man in a squirrelskin parka lift a beermug to
hurl at Trethaway a couple of paces off  And the fingers which were
more used to testtubes and water colors doubled into a hard fist
which smote the mugthrower cleanly on the point of the jaw  The man
merely dropped the glass and himself on the floor  Vance was dazed for
the moment then he realized that he had knocked the man
unconsciousthe first in his lifeand a pang of delight thrilled
through him

Colonel Trethaway thanked him with a look and shouted Get on the
outside  Work to the door Corliss  Work to the door

Quite a struggle took place before the stormdoors could be thrown
open but the colonel still attached to the threelegged stool
effectually dissipated the opposition and the Opera House disgorged
its turbulent contents into the street  This accomplished hostilities
ceased after the manner of such fights and the crowd scattered  The
two policemen went back to keep order accompanied by the rest of the
allies while Corliss and the colonel followed by the WolfSkin Cap
and Del Bishop proceeded up the street

Blood and sweat  Blood and sweat Colonel Trethaway exulted  Talk
about putting the vim into one  Why Im twenty years younger if Im a
day  Corliss your hand  I congratulate you I do I heartily do
Candidly I didnt think it was in you  Youre a surprise sir a
surprise

And a surprise to myself Corliss answered  The reaction had set in
and he was feeling sick and faint  And you also are a surprise
The way you handled that stool

Yes now  I flatter myself I did fairly well with it  Did you
seewell look at that  He held up the weapon in question still
tightly clutched and joined in the laugh against himself

Whom have I to thank gentlemen

They had come to a pause at the corner and the man they had rescued
was holding out his hand

My name is St Vincent he went on and

What name Del Bishop queried with sudden interest

St Vincent Gregory St Vincent

Bishops fist shot out and Gregory St Vincent pitched heavily into
the snow  The colonel instinctively raised the stool then helped
Corliss to hold the pocketminer back

Are you crazy man Vance demanded

The skunk  I wish Id hit m harder was the response  Then Oh
thats all right  Let go o me  I wont hit m again  Let go o me
Im goin home  Goodnight

As they helped St Vincent to his feet Vance could have sworn he heard
the colonel giggling  And he confessed to it later as he explained
It was so curious and unexpected  But he made amends by taking it
upon himself to see St Vincent home

But why did you hit him Corliss asked unavailingly for the fourth
time after he had got into his cabin

The mean crawlin skunk the pocketminer gritted in his blankets
Whatd you stop me for anyway  I wish Id hit m twice as hard




CHAPTER XII

Mr Harney pleased to meet you  Dave I believe Dave Harney  Dave
Harney nodded and Gregory St Vincent turned to Frona  You see Miss
Welse the world is none so large  Mr Harney and I are not strangers
after all

The Eldorado king studied the others face until a glimmering
intelligence came to him  Hold on he cried as St Vincent started
to speak I got my finger on you  You were smoothfaced then  Lets
see fall of  summer of yep thats when  Summer of

He shoved out his hand and they shook again

Come an see me he invited as he moved away  Ive a right tidy
little shack up on the hill and another on Eldorado  Latchstrings
always out  Come an see me an stay ez long ez youve a mind to
Sorry to quit you cold but I got to traipse down to the Opery House
and collect my taxessugar  Miss Fronall tell you

You are a surprise Mr St Vincent  Frona switched back to the
point of interest after briefly relating Harneys saccharine
difficulties  The country must indeed have been a wilderness nine
years ago and to think that you went through it at that early day  Do
tell me about it

Gregory St Vincent shrugged his shoulders There is very little to
tell  It was an ugly failure filled with many things that are not
nice and containing nothing of which to be proud

But do tell me I enjoy such things  They seem closer and truer to
life than the ordinary everyday happenings  A failure as you call
it implies something attempted  What did you attempt

He noted her frank interest with satisfaction  Well if you will I
can tell you in few words all there is to tell  I took the mad idea
into my head of breaking a new path around the world and in the
interest of science and journalism particularly journalism I proposed
going through Alaska crossing the Bering Straits on the ice and
journeying to Europe by way of Northern Siberia  It was a splendid
undertaking most of it being virgin ground only I failed  I crossed
the Straits in good order but came to grief in Eastern Siberiaall
because of Tamerlane is the excuse I have grown accustomed to making

A Ulysses  Mrs Schoville clapped her hands and joined them  A
modern Ulysses  How romantic

But not an Othello Frona replied  His tongue is a sluggard  He
leaves one at the most interesting point with an enigmatical reference
to a man of a bygone age  You take an unfair advantage of us Mr St
Vincent and we shall be unhappy until you show how Tamerlane brought
your journey to an untimely end

He laughed and with an effort put aside his reluctance to speak of his
travels  When Tamerlane swept with fire and sword over Eastern Asia
states were disrupted cities overthrown and tribes scattered like
stardust  In fact a vast people was hurled broadcast over the land
Fleeing before the mad lust of the conquerors these refugees swung far
into Siberia circling to the north and east and fringing the rim of
the polar basin with a spray of Mongol tribesam I not tiring you

No no Mrs Schoville exclaimed  It is fascinating  Your method
of narration is so vivid  It reminds me ofof

Of Macaulay St Vincent laughed goodnaturedly  You know I am a
journalist and he has strongly influenced my style  But I promise you
I shall tone down  However to return had it not been for these
Mongol tribes I should not have been halted in my travels  Instead of
being forced to marry a greasy princess and to become proficient in
interclannish warfare and reindeerstealing I should have travelled
easily and peaceably to St Petersburg

Oh these heroes  Are they not exasperating Frona  But what about
the reindeerstealing and the greasy princesses

The Gold Commissioners wife beamed upon him and glancing for
permission to Frona he went on

The coast people were Esquimo stock merrynatured and happy and
inoffensive  They called themselves the Oukilion or the Sea Men  I
bought dogs and food from them and they treated me splendidly  But
they were subject to the Chow Chuen or interior people who were known
as the Deer Men  The Chow Chuen were a savage indomitable breed with
all the fierceness of the untamed Mongol plus double his viciousness
As soon as I left the coast they fell upon me confiscated my goods
and made me a slave

But were there no Russians Mrs Schoville asked

Russians  Among the Chow Chuen  He laughed his amusement
Geographically they are within the White Tsars domain but
politically no  I doubt if they ever heard of him  Remember the
interior of NorthEastern Siberia is hidden in the polar gloom a terra
incognita where few men have gone and none has returned

But you

I chance to be the exception  Why I was spared I do not know  It
just so happened  At first I was vilely treated beaten by the women
and children clothed in vermininfested mangy furs and fed on refuse
They were utterly heartless  How I managed to survive is beyond me
but I know that often and often at first I meditated suicide  The
only thing that saved me during that period from taking my own life was
the fact that I quickly became too stupefied and bestial what of my
suffering and degradation  Halffrozen halfstarved undergoing
untold misery and hardship beaten many and many a time into
insensibility I became the sheerest animal

On looking back much of it seems a dream  There are gaps which my
memory cannot fill  I have vague recollections of being lashed to a
sled and dragged from camp to camp and tribe to tribe  Carted about
for exhibition purposes I suppose much as we do lions and elephants
and wild men  How far I so journeyed up and down that bleak region I
cannot guess though it must have been several thousand miles  I do
know that when consciousness returned to me and I really became myself
again I was fully a thousand miles to the west of the point where I
was captured

It was springtime and from out of a forgotten past it seemed I
suddenly opened my eyes  A reindeer thong was about my waist and made
fast to the tailend of a sled  This thong I clutched with both hands
like an organgrinders monkey for the flesh of my body was raw and in
great sores from where the thong had cut in

A low cunning came to me and I made myself agreeable and servile
That night I danced and sang and did my best to amuse them for I was
resolved to incur no more of the maltreatment which had plunged me into
darkness  Now the Deer Men traded with the Sea Men and the Sea Men
with the whites especially the whalers  So later I discovered a deck
of cards in the possession of one of the women and I proceeded to
mystify the Chow Chuen with a few commonplace tricks  Likewise with
fitting solemnity I perpetrated upon them the little I knew of parlor
legerdemain  Result I was appreciated at once and was better fed and
better clothed

To make a long story short I gradually became a man of importance
First the old people and the women came to me for advice and later the
chiefs  My slight but rough and ready knowledge of medicine and
surgery stood me in good stead and I became indispensable  From a
slave I worked myself to a seat among the head men and in war and
peace so soon as I had learned their ways was an unchallenged
authority  Reindeer was their medium of exchange their unit of value
as it were and we were almost constantly engaged in cattle forays
among the adjacent clans or in protecting our own herds from their
inroads  I improved upon their methods taught them better strategy
and tactics and put a snap and go into their operations which no
neighbor tribe could withstand

But still though I became a power I was no nearer my freedom  It
was laughable for I had overreached myself and made myself too
valuable  They cherished me with exceeding kindness but they were
jealously careful  I could go and come and command without restraint
but when the trading parties went down to the coast I was not permitted
to accompany them  That was the one restriction placed upon my
movements

Also it is very tottery in the high places and when I began altering
their political structures I came to grief again  In the process of
binding together twenty or more of the neighboring tribes in order to
settle rival claims I was given the overlordship of the federation
But Old PiUne was the greatest of the underchiefsa king in a
wayand in relinquishing his claim to the supreme leadership he
refused to forego all the honors  The least that could be done to
appease him was for me to marry his daughter Ilswunga  Nay he
demanded it  I offered to abandon the federation but he would not
hear of it  And

And Mrs Schoville murmured ecstatically

And I married Ilswunga which is the Chow Chuen name for Wild Deer
Poor Ilswunga  Like Swinburnes Iseult of Brittany and I Tristram
The last I saw of her she was playing solitaire in the Mission of
Irkutsky and stubbornly refusing to take a bath

Oh mercy  Its ten oclock Mrs Schoville suddenly cried her
husband having at last caught her eye from across the room  Im so
sorry I cant hear the rest Mr St Vincent how you escaped and all
that  But you must come and see me  I am just dying to hear

And I took you for a tenderfoot a chechaquo Frona said meekly as
St Vincent tied his earflaps and turned up his collar preparatory to
leaving

I dislike posing he answered matching her meekness  It smacks of
insincerity it really is untrue  And it is so easy to slip into it
Look at the oldtimerssourdoughs as they proudly call themselves
Just because they have been in the country a few years they let
themselves grow wild and woolly and glorify in it  They may not know
it but it is a pose  In so far as they cultivate salient
peculiarities they cultivate falseness to themselves and live lies

I hardly think you are wholly just Frona said in defence of her
chosen heroes  I do like what you say about the matter in general
and I detest posing but the majority of the oldtimers would be
peculiar in any country under any circumstances  That peculiarity is
their own it is their mode of expression  And it is I am sure just
what makes them go into new countries  The normal man of course
stays at home

Oh I quite agree with you Miss Welse he temporized easily  I did
not intend it so sweepingly  I meant to brand that sprinkling among
them who are poseurs  In the main as you say they are honest and
sincere and natural

Then we have no quarrel  But Mr St Vincent before you go would
you care to come tomorrow evening  We are getting up theatricals for
Christmas  I know you can help us greatly and I think it will not be
altogether unenjoyable to you  All the younger people are
interestedthe officials officers of police mining engineers
gentlemen rovers and so forth to say nothing of the nice women  You
are bound to like them

I am sure I shall as he took her hand  Tomorrow did you say

Tomorrow evening  Goodnight

A brave man she told herself as she went bade from the door and a
splendid type of the race




CHAPTER XIII

Gregory St Vincent swiftly became an important factor in the social
life of Dawson  As a representative of the Amalgamated Press
Association he had brought with him the best credentials a powerful
influence could obtain and over and beyond he was well qualified
socially by his letters of introduction  It developed in a quiet way
that he was a wanderer and explorer of no small parts and that he had
seen life and strife pretty well all over the earths crust  And
withal he was so mild and modest about it that nobody not even among
the men was irritated by his achievements  Incidentally he ran
across numerous old acquaintances  Jacob Welse he had met at St
Michaels in the fall of  just prior to his crossing Bering Straits
on the ice  A month or so later Father Barnum who had come up from
the Lower River to take charge of the hospital had met him a couple of
hundred miles on his way north of St Michaels  Captain Alexander of
the Police had rubbed shoulders with him in the British Legation at
Peking  And Bettles another oldtimer of standing had met him at
Fort o Yukon nine years before

So Dawson ever prone to look askance at the casual comer received him
with open arms  Especially was he a favorite with the women  As a
promoter of pleasures and an organizer of amusements he took the lead
and it quickly came to pass that no function was complete without him
Not only did he come to help in the theatricals but insensibly and as
a matter of course he took charge  Frona as her friends charged was
suffering from a stroke of Ibsen so they hit upon the Dolls House
and she was cast for Nora  Corliss who was responsible by the way
for the theatricals having first suggested them was to take Torvalds
part but his interest seemed to have died out or at any rate he
begged off on the plea of business rush  So St Vincent without
friction took Torvalds lines  Corliss did manage to attend one
rehearsal  It might have been that he had come tired from forty miles
with the dogs and it might have been that Torvald was obliged to put
his arm about Nora at divers times and to toy playfully with her ear
but one way or the other Corliss never attended again

Busy he certainly was and when not away on trail he was closeted
almost continually with Jacob Welse and Colonel Trethaway  That it was
a deal of magnitude was evidenced by the fact that Welses mining
interests involved alone mounted to several millions  Corliss was
primarily a worker and doer and on discovering that his thorough
theoretical knowledge lacked practical experience he felt put upon his
mettle and worked the harder  He even marvelled at the silliness of
the men who had burdened him with such responsibilities simply because
of his pull and he told Trethaway as much  But the colonel while
recognizing his shortcomings liked him for his candor and admired him
for his effort and for the quickness with which he came to grasp things
actual

Del Bishop who had refused to play any hand but his own had gone to
work for Corliss because by so doing he was enabled to play his own
hand better  He was practically unfettered while the opportunities to
further himself were greatly increased  Equipped with the best of
outfits and a magnificent dogteam his task was mainly to run the
various creeks and keep his eyes and ears open  A pocketminer first
last and always he was privately on the constant lookout for pockets
which occupation did not interfere in the least with the duty he owed
his employer  And as the days went by he stored his mind with
miscellaneous data concerning the nature of the various placer deposits
and the lay of the land against the summer when the thawed surface and
the running water would permit him to follow a trace from creekbed to
sideslope and source

Corliss was a good employer paid well and considered it his right to
work men as he worked himself  Those who took service with him either
strengthened their own manhood and remained or quit and said harsh
things about him  Jacob Welse noted this trait with appreciation and
he sounded the mining engineers praises continually  Frona heard and
was gratified for she liked the things her father liked and she was
more gratified because the man was Corliss  But in his rush of
business she saw less of him than formerly while St Vincent came to
occupy a greater and growing portion of her time  His healthful
optimistic spirit pleased her while he corresponded well to her
idealized natural man and favorite racial type  Her first doubtthat
if what he said was truehad passed away  All the evidence had gone
counter  Men who at first questioned the truth of his wonderful
adventures gave in after hearing him talk  Those to any extent
conversant with the parts of the world he made mention of could not
but acknowledge that he knew what he talked about  Young Soley
representing Bannocks News Syndicate and Holmes of the Fairweather
recollected his return to the world in  and the sensation created
thereby  And Sid Winslow Pacific Coast journalist had made his
acquaintance at the Wanderers Club shortly after he landed from the
United States revenue cutter which had brought him down from the north
Further as Frona well saw he bore the earmarks of his experiences
they showed their handiwork in his whole outlook on life  Then the
primitive was strong in him and his was a passionate race pride which
fully matched hers  In the absence of Corliss they were much together
went out frequently with the dogs and grew to know each other
thoroughly

All of which was not pleasant to Corliss especially when the brief
intervals he could devote to her were usually intruded upon by the
correspondent  Naturally Corliss was not drawn to him and other men
who knew or had heard of the Opera House occurrence only accepted him
after a tentative fashion  Trethaway had the indiscretion once or
twice to speak slightingly of him but so fiercely was he defended by
his admirers that the colonel developed the good taste to thenceforward
keep his tongue between his teeth  Once Corliss listening to an
extravagant panegyric bursting from the lips of Mrs Schoville
permitted himself the luxury of an incredulous smile but the quick
wave of color in Fronas face and the gathering of the brows warned
him

At another time he was unwise enough and angry enough to refer to the
Opera House broil  He was carried away and what he might have said of
that nights happening would have redounded neither to St Vincents
credit nor to his own had not Frona innocently put a seal upon his
lips ere he had properly begun

Yes she said  Mr St Vincent told me about it  He met you for
the first time that night I believe  You all fought royally on his
sideyou and Colonel Trethaway  He spoke his admiration unreservedly
and to tell the truth with enthusiasm

Corliss made a gesture of depreciation

No no  From what he said you must have behaved splendidly  And I
was most pleased to hear  It must be great to give the brute the rein
now and again and healthy too  Great for us who have wandered from
the natural and softened to sickly ripeness  Just to shake off
artificiality and rage up and down and yet the inmost mentor serene
and passionless viewing all and saying This is my other self
Behold  I who am now powerless am the power behind and ruleth still
This other self mine ancient violent elder self rages blindly as
the beast but tis I sitting apart who discern the merit of the
cause and bid him rage or bid him cease  Oh to be a man

Corliss could not help a humoring smile which put Frona upon defence
at once

Tell me Vance how did it feel  Have I not described it rightly
Were the symptoms yours  Did you not hold aloof and watch yourself
play the brute

He remembered the momentary daze which came when he stunned the man
with his fist and nodded

And pride she demanded inexorably  Or shame

Aa little of both and more of the first than the second he
confessed  At the time I suppose I was madly exultant then
afterwards came the shame and I tossed awake half the night

And finally

Pride I guess  I couldnt help it couldnt down it  I awoke in the
morning feeling as though I had won my spurs  In a subconscious way I
was inordinately proud of myself and time and again mentally I
caught myself throwing chests  Then came the shame again and I tried
to reason back my selfrespect  And last of all pride  The fight was
fair and open  It was none of my seeking  I was forced into it by the
best of motives  I am not sorry and I would repeat it if necessary

And rightly so Fronas eyes were sparkling  And how did Mr St
Vincent acquit himself

He      Oh I suppose all right creditably  I was too busy
watching my other self to take notice

But he saw you

Most likely so  I acknowledge my negligence  I should have done
better the chances are had I thought it would have been of interest
to youpardon me  Just my bungling wit  The truth is I was too much
of a greenhorn to hold my own and spare glances on my neighbors

So Corliss went away glad that he had not spoken and keenly
appreciating St Vincents craft whereby he had so adroitly forestalled
adverse comment by telling the story in his own modest selfeffacing
way


Two men and a woman  The most potent trinity of factors in the
creating of human pathos and tragedy  As ever in the history of man
since the first father dropped down from his arboreal home and walked
upright so at Dawson  Necessarily there were minor factors not
least among which was Del Bishop who in his aggressive way stepped
in and accelerated things  This came about in a trailcamp on the way
to Miller Creek where Corliss was bent on gathering in a large number
of lowgrade claims which could only be worked profitably on a large
scale

Ill not be wastin candles when I make a strike savve the
pocketminer remarked savagely to the coffee which he was settling
with a chunk of ice  Not on your life I guess rather not

Kerosene Corliss queried running a piece of baconrind round the
fryingpan and pouring in the batter

Kerosene hell  You wont see my trail for smoke when I get a gait on
for Gods country my wad in my poke and the sunshine in my eyes  Say
Howd a good juicy tenderloin strike you just now green onions fried
potatoes and fixins on the side  Shelp me thats the first
proposition Ill hump myself up against  Then a general whoopla for
a weekSeattle or Frisco I dont care a rap which and then

Out of money and after a job

Not on your family tree Bishop roared  Cache my sack before I go
on the tear sure pop and then afterwards Southern California
Manys the day Ive had my eye on a peach of a fruit farm down
thereforty thousandll buy it  No more workin for grubstakes and
the like  Figured it out long agohired men to work the ranch a
manager to run it and me ownin the game and livin off the
percentage  A stable with always a couple of bronchos handy handy to
slap the packs and saddles on and be off and away whenever the fever
for chasin pockets came over me  Great pocket country down there to
the east and along the desert

And no house on the ranch

Cert  With sweet peas growin up the sides and in back a patch for
vegetablesstringbeans and spinach and radishes cucumbers and
sparagrass turnips carrots cabbage and such  And a woman inside
to draw me back when I get to runnin loco after the pockets  Say you
know all about minin  Did you ever go snoozin round after pockets
No  Then just steer clear  Theyre worse than whiskey horses or
cards  Women when they come afterwards aint in it  Whenever you
get a hankerin after pockets go right off and get married  Its the
only thingll save you and even then mebbe it wont  I ought a
done it years ago  I might a made something of myself if I had
Jerusalem the jobs Ive jumped and the good things chucked in my time
just because of pockets  Say Corliss you want to get married you
do and right off  Im tellin you straight  Take warnin from me and
dont stay single any longer than Godll let you sure

Corliss laughed

Sure I mean it  Im oldern you and know what Im talkin  Now
theres a bit of a thing down in Dawson Id like to see you get your
hands on  You was made for each other both of you

Corliss was past the stage when he would have treated Bishops meddling
as an impertinence  The trail which turns men into the same blankets
and makes them brothers was the great leveller of distinctions as he
had come to learn  So he flopped a flapjack and held his tongue

Why dont you waltz in and win Del demanded insistently  Dont
you cotton to her  I know you do or you wouldnt come back to cabin
after bein with her awalkinlike on air  Better waltz in while you
got a chance  Why there was Emmy a tidy bit of flesh as women go
and we took to each other on the jump  But I kept achasin pockets
and chasin pockets and delayin  And then a big black lumberman a
Kanuck began sidlin up to her and I made up my mind to speakonly I
went off after one more pocket just one more and when I got back she
was Mrs Somebody Else

So take warnin  Theres that writerguy that skunk I poked outside
the Opera House  Hes walkin right in and gettin thick and heres
you just like me aracin round all creation and lettin matrimony
slide  Mark my words Corliss  Some fine frost youll come slippin
into camp and find em housekeepin  Sure  With nothin left for you
in life but pocketing

The picture was so unpleasant that Corliss turned surly and ordered him
to shut up

Who  Me Del asked so aggrievedly that Corliss laughed

What would you do then he asked

Me  In all kindness Ill tell you  As soon as you get back you go
and see her  Make dates with her ahead till you got to put em on
paper to remember em all  Get a cinch on her spare time ahead so as
to shut the other fellow out  Dont get down in the dirt to
hershes not that kindbut dont be too high and mighty neither
Just sososavve  And then some time when you see shes feelin
good and smilin at you in that way of hers why up and call her hand
Of course I cant say what the showdownll be  Thats for you to find
out  But dont hold off too long about it  Better married early than
never  And if that writerguy shoves in poke him in the
breadbaskethard  Thatll settle him plenty  Better still take him
off to one side and talk to him  Tellm youre a bad man and that you
staked that claim before he was dry behind the ears and that if he
comes nosin around tryin to file on it youll beat his head off

Bishop got up stretched and went outside to feed the dogs  Dont
forget to beat his head off he called back  And if youre squeamish
about it just call on me  I wont keep m waitin long




CHAPTER XIV

Ah the salt water Miss Welse the strong salt water and the big waves
and the heavy boats for smooth or roughthat I know  But the fresh
water and the little canoes eggshells fairy bubbles a big breath a
sigh a heartpulse too much and pouf over you go not so that I do
not know  Baron Courbertin smiled selfcommiseratingly and went on
But it is delightful magnificent  I have watched and envied  Some day
I shall learn

It is not so difficult St Vincent interposed  Is it Miss Welse
Just a sure and delicate poise of mind and body

Like the tightrope dancer

Oh you are incorrigible Frona laughed  I feel certain that you know
as much about canoes as we

And you knowa woman  Cosmopolitan as the Frenchman was the
independence and ability for doing of the Yankee women were a perpetual
wonder to him  How

When I was a very little girl at Dyea among the Indians  But next
spring after the river breaks well give you your first lessons Mr
St Vincent and I  So you see you will return to civilization with
accomplishments  And you will surely love it

Under such charming tutorship he murmured gallantly  But you Mr
St Vincent do you think I shall be so successful that I may come to
love it  Do you love ityou who stand always in the background
sparing of speech inscrutable as though able but unwilling to speak
from out the eternal wisdom of a vast experience  The baron turned
quickly to Frona  We are old friends did I not tell you  So I may
what you Americans call josh with him  Is it not so Mr St
Vincent

Gregory nodded and Frona said I am sure you met at the ends of the
earth somewhere

Yokohama St Vincent cut in shortly eleven years ago in
cherryblossom time  But Baron Courbertin does me an injustice which
stings unhappily because it is not true  I am afraid when I get
started that I talk too much about myself

A martyr to your friends Frona conciliated  And such a teller of
good tales that your friends cannot forbear imposing upon you

Then tell us a canoe story the baron begged  A good one  Awhat
you Yankees calla hairraiser

They drew up to Mrs Schovilles fat woodburning stove and St  Vincent
told of the great whirlpool in the Box Canyon of the terrible corkscrew
in the mane of the White Horse Rapids and of his cowardly comrade who
walking around had left him to go through alonenine years before when
the Yukon was virgin

Half an hour later Mrs Schoville bustled in with Corliss in her wake

That hill  The last of my breath she gasped pulling off her mittens
Never saw such luck she declared none the less vehemently the next
moment

This play will never come off  I never shall be Mrs Linden  How can
I  Krogstads gone on a stampede to Indian River and no one knows when
hell be back  Krogstad to Corliss is Mr Maybrick you know  And
Mrs Alexander has the neuralgia and cant stir out  So theres no
rehearsal today thats flat  She attitudinized dramatically Yes
in my first terror  But a day has passed and in that day I have seen
incredible things in this house  Helmer must know everything  There
must be an end to this unhappy secret  O Krogstad you need me and II
need you and you are over on the Indian River making sourdough bread
and I shall never see you more

They clapped their applause

My only reward for venturing out and keeping you all waiting was my
meeting with this ridiculous fellow  She shoved Corliss forward  Oh
you have not met  Baron Courbertin Mr Corliss  If you strike it rich
baron I advise you to sell to Mr Corliss  He has the moneybags of
Croesus and will buy anything so long as the title is good  And if you
dont strike sell anyway  Hes a professional philanthropist you know

But would you believe it addressing the general group this
ridiculous fellow kindly offered to see me up the hill and gossip along
the waygossip though he refused pointblank to come in and watch the
rehearsal  But when he found there wasnt to be any he changed about
like a weathervane  So here he is claiming to have been away to Miller
Creek but between ourselves there is no telling what dark deeds

Dark deeds  Look Frona broke in pointing to the tip of an amber
mouthpiece which projected from Vances outside breastpocket  A pipe
My congratulations

She held out her hand and he shook goodhumoredly

All Dels fault he laughed  When I go before the great white throne
it is he who shall stand forth and be responsible for that particular
sin

An improvement nevertheless she argued  All that is wanting is a
good round swearword now and again

Oh I assure you I am not unlearned he retorted  No man can drive
dogs else  I can swear from hell to breakfast by damn and back again
if you will permit me to the last link of perdition  By the bones of
Pharaoh and the blood of Judas for instance are fairly efficacious with
a string of huskies but the best of my dogdriving nomenclature mores
the pity women cannot stand  I promise you however in spite of hell
and high water

Oh  Oh Mrs Schoville screamed thrusting her fingers into her ears

Madame Baron Courbertin spoke up gravely it is a fact a lamentable
fact that the dogs of the north are responsible for more mens souls
than all other causes put together  Is it not so  I leave it to the
gentlemen

Both Corliss and St Vincent solemnly agreed and proceeded to detonate
the lady by swapping heartrending and apposite dog tales

St Vincent and the baron remained behind to take lunch with the Gold
Commissioners wife leaving Frona and Corliss to go down the hill
together  Silently consenting as though to prolong the descent they
swerved to the right cutting transversely the myriad footpaths and sled
roads which led down into the town  It was a midDecember day clear and
cold and the hesitant highnoon sun having laboriously dragged its pale
orb up from behind the southern landrim balked at the great climb to
the zenith and began its shamefaced slide back beneath the earth  Its
oblique rays refracted from the floating frost particles till the air was
filled with glittering jeweldustresplendent blazing flashing light
and fire but cold as outer space

They passed down through the scintillant magical sheen their moccasins
rhythmically crunching the snow and their breaths wreathing mysteriously
from their lips in sprayed opalescence  Neither spoke nor cared to
speak so wonderful was it all  At their feet under the great vault of
heaven a speck in the midst of the white vastness huddled the golden
citypuny and sordid feebly protesting against immensity mans
challenge to the infinite

Calls of men and cries of encouragement came sharply to them from close
at hand and they halted  There was an eager yelping a scratching of
feet and a string of icerimed wolfdogs with hotlolling tongues and
dripping jaws pulled up the slope and turned into the path ahead of
them  On the sled a long and narrow box of roughsawed spruce told the
nature of the freight  Two dogdrivers a woman walking blindly and a
blackrobed priest made up the funeral cortege  A few paces farther on
the dogs were again put against the steep and with whine and shout and
clatter the unheeding clay was hauled on and upward to its icehewn
hillside chamber

A zoneconqueror Frona broke voice

Corliss found his thought following hers and answered These battlers
of frost and fighters of hunger  I can understand how the dominant races
have come down out of the north to empire  Strong to venture strong to
endure with infinite faith and infinite patience is it to be wondered
at

Frona glanced at him in eloquent silence

We smote with our swords he chanted to me it was a joy like
having my bright bride by me on the couch  I have marched with my
bloody sword and the raven has followed me  Furiously we fought the
fire passed over the dwellings of men we slept in the blood of those who
kept the gates

But do you feel it Vance she cried her hand flashing out and resting
on his arm

I begin to feel I think  The north has taught me is teaching me  The
old things come back with new significance  Yet I do not know  It
seems a tremendous egotism a magnificent dream

But you are not a negro or a Mongol nor are you descended from the
negro or Mongol

Yes he considered I am my fathers son and the line goes back to
the seakings who never slept under the smoky rafters of a roof or
drained the alehorn by inhabited hearth  There must be a reason for the
deadstatus of the black a reason for the Teuton spreading over the
earth as no other race has ever spread  There must be something in race
heredity else I would not leap at the summons

A great race Vance  Half of the earth its heritage and all of the
sea  And in threescore generations it has achieved it allthink of it
threescore generationsand today it reaches out widerarmed than ever
The smiter and the destroyer among nations the builder and the
lawgiver  Oh Vance my love is passionate but God will forgive for
it is good  A great race greatly conceived and if to perish greatly
to perish  Dont you remember

Trembles Yggdrasils ash yet standing groans that ancient tree and
the Jotun Loki is loosed  The shadows groan on the ways of Hel until
the fire of Surt has consumed the tree  Hrym steers from the east the
waters rise the mundane snake is coiled in jotunrage  The worm heats
the water and the eagle screams the pale of beak tears carcases the
ship Naglfar is loosed  Surt from the south comes with flickering flame
shines from his sword the Valgods sun

Swaying there like a furred Valkyrie above the final carnage of men and
gods she touched his imagination and the blood surged exultingly along
unknown channels thrilling and uplifting

The stony hills are dashed together the giantesses totter men tread
the path of Hel and heaven is cloven  The sun darkens earth in ocean
sinks fall from heaven the bright stars fires breath assails the
allnourishing tree towering fire plays against heaven itself

Outlined against the blazing air her brows and lashes white with frost
the jeweldust striking and washing against hair and face and the
southsun lighting her with a great redness the man saw her as the
genius of the race  The traditions of the blood laid hold of him and he
felt strangely at one with the whiteskinned yellowhaired giants of the
younger world  And as he looked upon her the mighty past rose before
him and the caverns of his being resounded with the shock and tumult of
forgotten battles  With bellowing of stormwinds and crash of smoking
North Sea waves he saw the sharpbeaked fighting galleys and the
seaflung Northmen greatmuscled deepchested sprung from the
elements men of sword and sweep marauders and scourgers of the warm
southlands  The din of twenty centuries of battle was roaring in his
ear and the clamor for return to type strong upon him  He seized her
hands passionately

Be the bright bride by me Frona  Be the bright bride by me on the
couch

She started and looked down at him questioningly  Then the import of it
reached her and she involuntarily drew back  The sun shot a last failing
flicker across the earth and vanished  The fire went out of the air and
the day darkened  Far above the hearsedogs howled mournfully

No he interrupted as words formed on her lips  Do not speak  I
know my answer your answer     now     I was a fool     Come
let us go down

It was not until they had left the mountain behind them crossed the
flat and come out on the river by the sawmill that the bustle and
skurry of human life made it seem possible for them to speak  Corliss
had walked with his eyes moodily bent to the ground and Frona with head
erect and looking everywhere stealing an occasional glance to his face
Where the road rose over the log runway of the mill the footing was
slippery and catching at her to save her from falling their eyes met

II am grieved she hesitated  And then in unconscious selfdefence
It was so     I had not expected itjust then

Else you would have prevented he asked bitterly

Yes  I think I should have  I did not wish to give you pain

Then you expected it some time

And feared it  But I had hoped     I     Vance I did not come
into the Klondike to get married  I liked you at the beginning and I
have liked you more and morenever so much as todaybut

But you had never looked upon me in the light of a possible
husbandthat is what you are trying to say

As he spoke he looked at her sidewise and sharply and when her eyes
met his with the same old frankness the thought of losing her maddened
him

But I have she answered at once  I have looked upon you in that
light but somehow it was not convincing  Why I do not know  There was
so much I found to like in you so much

He tried to stop her with a dissenting gesture but she went on

So much to admire  There was all the warmth of friendship and closer
friendshipa growing camaraderie in fact but nothing more  Though
I did not wish more I should have welcomed it had it come

As one welcomes the unwelcome guest

Why wont you help me Vance instead of making it harder  It is hard
on you surely but do you imagine that I am enjoying it  I feel because
of your pain and further I know when I refuse a dear friend for a
lover the dear friend goes from me  I do not part with friends lightly

I see doubly bankrupt friend and lover both  But they are easily
replaced  I fancy I was half lost before I spoke  Had I remained
silent it would have been the same anyway  Time softens new
associations new thoughts and faces men with marvellous adventures

She stopped him abruptly

It is useless Vance no matter what you may say  I shall not quarrel
with you  I can understand how you feel

If I am quarrelsome then I had better leave you  He halted suddenly
and she stood beside him  Here comes Dave Harney  He will see you
home  Its only a step

You are doing neither yourself nor me kindness  She spoke with final
firmness  I decline to consider this the end  We are too close to it
to understand it fairly  You must come and see me when we are both
calmer  I refuse to be treated in this fashion  It is childish of you
She shot a hasty glance at the approaching Eldorado king  I do not
think I deserve it at your hands  I refuse to lose you as a friend  And
I insist that you come and see me that things remain on the old footing

He shook his head

Hello Dave Harney touched his cap and slowed down loosejointedly
Sorry you didnt take my tip  Dogs gone up a dollar a pound since
yesterday and still awhoopin  Goodafternoon Miss Frona and Mr
Corliss  Goin my way

Miss Welse is  Corliss touched the visor of his cap and halfturned on
his heel

Wherere you off to Dave demanded

Got an appointment he lied

Remember Frona called to him you must come and see me

Too busy Im afraid just now  Goodby  So long Dave

Jemimy Dave remarked staring after him but hes a hustler  Always
busywith big things too  Wonder why he didnt go in for dogs




CHAPTER XV

But Corliss did go back to see her and before the day was out  A
little bitter selfcommunion had not taken long to show him his
childishness  The sting of loss was hard enough but the thought now
they could be nothing to each other that her last impressions of him
should be bad hurt almost as much and in a way even more  And
further putting all to the side he was really ashamed  He had
thought that he could have taken such a disappointment more manfully
especially since in advance he had not been at all sure of his footing

So he called upon her walked with her up to the Barracks and on the
way with her help managed to soften the awkwardness which the morning
had left between them  He talked reasonably and meekly which she
countenanced and would have apologized roundly had she not prevented
him

Not the slightest bit of blame attaches to you she said  Had I
been in your place I should probably have done the same and behaved
much more outrageously  For you were outrageous you know

But had you been in my place and I in yours he answered with a
weak attempt at humor there would have been no need

She smiled glad that he was feeling less strongly about it

But unhappily our social wisdom does not permit such a reversal he
added more with a desire to be saying something

Ah she laughed  Theres where my Jesuitism comes in  I can rise
above our social wisdom

You dont mean to saythat

There shocked as usual  No I could not be so crude as to speak
outright but I might finesse as you whistplayers say  Accomplish
the same end only with greater delicacy  After all a distinction
without a difference

Could you he asked

I know I couldif the occasion demanded  I am not one to let what I
might deem lifehappiness slip from me without a struggle  That
judicially occurs only in books and among sentimentalists  As my
father always says I belong to the strugglers and fighters  That
which appeared to me great and sacred that would I battle for though
I brought heaven tumbling about my ears

You have made me very happy Vance she said at parting by the
Barracks gates  And things shall go along in the same old way  And
mind not a bit less of you than formerly but rather much more


But Corliss after several perfunctory visits forgot the way which led
to Jacob Welses home and applied himself savagely to his work  He
even had the hypocrisy at times to felicitate himself upon his
escape and to draw bleak fireside pictures of the dismal future which
would have been had he and Frona incompatibly mated  But this was only
at times  As a rule the thought of her made him hungry in a way akin
to physical hunger and the one thing he found to overcome it was hard
work and plenty of it  But even then what of trail and creek and
camp and survey he could only get away from her in his waking hours
In his sleep he was ignobly conquered and Del Bishop who was with him
much studied his restlessness and gave a ready ear to his mumbled
words

The pocketminer put two and two together and made a correct induction
from the different little things which came under his notice  But this
did not require any great astuteness  The simple fact that he no
longer called on Frona was sufficient evidence of an unprospering suit
But Del went a step farther and drew the corollary that St Vincent
was the cause of it all  Several times he had seen the correspondent
with Frona going one place and another and was duly incensed thereat

Ill fix m yet he muttered in camp one evening over on Gold Bottom

Whom Corliss queried

Who  That newspaper man thats who

What for

Awgeneral principles  Whynt you let me paste m that night at the
Opera House

Corliss laughed at the recollection  Why did you strike him Del

General principles Del snapped back and shut up

But Del Bishop for all his punitive spirit did not neglect the main
chance and on the return trip when they came to the forks of Eldorado
and Bonanza he called a halt

Say Corliss he began at once dyou know what a hunch is  His
employer nodded his comprehension  Well Ive got one  I aint never
asked favors of you before but this once I want you to lay over here
till tomorrow  Seems to me my fruit ranch is most in sight  I can
damn near smell the oranges aripenin

Certainly Corliss agreed  But better still Ill run on down to
Dawson and you can come in when youve finished hunching

Say Del objected  I said it was a hunch and I want to ring you in
on it savve  Youre all right and youve learned a hell of a lot out
of books  Youre a regular highroller when it comes to the
laboratory and all that but it takes yours truly to get down and read
the face of nature without spectacles  Now Ive got a theory

Corliss threw up his hands in affected dismay and the pocketminer
began to grow angry

Thats right  Laugh  But its built right up on your own pet theory
of erosion and changed riverbeds  And I didnt pocket among the
Mexicans two years for nothin  Where dyou spose this Eldorado gold
came fromrough and no signs of washin  Eh  Theres where you
need your spectacles  Books have made you shortsighted  But never
mind how  Tisnt exactly pockets neither but I know what Im
spelling about  I aint been keepin tab on traces for my health  I
can tell you mining sharps more about the lay of Eldorado Creek in one
minute than you could figure out in a month of Sundays  But never
mind no offence  You lay over with me till tomorrow and you can buy
a ranch longside of mine sure Well all right  I can rest up and
look over my notes while youre hunting your ancient riverbed

Didnt I tell you it was a hunch Del reproachfully demanded

And havent I agreed to stop over  What more do you want

To give you a fruit ranch thats what  Just to go with me and nose
round a bit thats all

I do not want any of your impossible fruit ranches  Im tired and
worried cant you leave me alone  I think I am more than fair when I
humor you to the extent of stopping over  You may waste your time
nosing around but I shall stay in camp  Understand

Burn my body but youre grateful  By the Jumpin Methuselah Ill
quit my job in two minutes if you dont fire me  Me alayin wake
nights and workin up my theory and calculatin on lettin you in and
you asnorin and Fronathis and Fronathat

Thatll do  Stop it

The hell it will  If I didnt know more about goldmining than you do
about courtin

Corliss sprang at him but Del dodged to one side and put up his fists
Then he ducked a wild right and left swing and sidestepped his way
into firmer footing on the hard trail

Hold on a moment he cried as Corliss made to come at him again
Just a second  If I lick you will you come up the hillside with me

Yes

And if I dont you can fire me  Thats fair  Come on

Vance had no show whatever as Del well knew who played with him
feinting attacking retreating dazzling and disappearing every now
and again out of his field of vision in a most exasperating way  As
Vance speedily discovered he possessed very little correlation between
mind and body and the next thing he discovered was that he was lying
in the snow and slowly coming back to his senses

Howhow did you do it he stammered to the pocketminer who had his
head on his knee and was rubbing his forehead with snow

Oh youll do Del laughed helping him limply to his feet  Youre
the right stuff  Ill show you some time  Youve got lots to learn
yet what you wont find in books  But not now  Weve got to wade in
and make camp then youre comin up the hill with me

Hee hee he chuckled later as they fitted the pipe of the Yukon
stove  Slow sighted and short  Couldnt follow me eh  But Ill
show you some time oh Ill show you all right all right

Grab an axe an come on he commanded when the camp was completed

He led the way up Eldorado borrowed a pick shovel and pan at a
cabin and headed up among the benches near the mouth of French Creek
Vance though feeling somewhat sore was laughing at himself by this
time and enjoying the situation  He exaggerated the humility with
which he walked at the heel of his conqueror while the extravagant
servility which marked his obedience to his hired man made that
individual grin

Youll do  Youve got the makins in you  Del threw down the tools
and scanned the run of the snowsurface carefully  Here take the
axe shinny up the hill and lug me down some skookum dry wood

By the time Corliss returned with the last load of wood the
pocketminer had cleared away the snow and moss in divers spots and
formed in general design a rude cross

Cuttin her both ways he explained  Mebbe Ill hit her here or
over there or up above but if theres anything in the hunch this is
the place  Bedrock dips in above and its deep there and most likely
richer but too much work  This is the rim of the bench  Cant be
moren a couple of feet down  All we want is indications afterwards
we can tap in from the side

As he talked he started fires here and there on the uncovered spaces
But look here Corliss I want you to mind this aint pocketin  This
is just plain ordinary prentice work but pocketinhe straightened
up his back and spoke reverentlybut pocketin is the deepest science
and the finest art  Delicate to a hairsbreadth hand and eye true
and steady as steel  When youve got to burn your pan blueblack twice
a day and out of a shovelful of gravel wash down to the one wee speck
of flour goldwhy thats washin thats what it is  Tell you what
Id sooner follow a pocket than eat

And you would sooner fight than do either  Bishop stopped to
consider   He weighed himself with care equal to that of retaining the
one wee speck of flour gold  No I wouldnt neither  Id take
pocketin in mine every time  Its as bad as dope Corliss sure  If
it once gets ahold of you youre a goner  Youll never shake it
Look at me  And talk about pipedreams they cant burn a candle
longside of it

He walked over and kicked one of the fires apart  Then he lifted the
pick and the steel point drove in and stopped with a metallic clang
as though brought up by solid cement

Aint thawed two inches he muttered stooping down and groping with
his fingers in the wet muck  The blades of last years grass had been
burned away but he managed to gather up and tear away a handful of the
roots

Hell

Whats the matter Corliss asked

Hell he repeated in a passionless way knocking the dirtcovered
roots against the pan

Corliss went over and stooped to closer inspection  Hold on he
cried picking up two or three grimy bits of dirt and rubbing them with
his fingers  A bright yellow flashed forth

Hell the pocketminer reiterated tonelessly  First rattle out the
box  Begins at the grass roots and goes all the way down

Head turned to the side and up eyes closed nostrils distended and
quivering he rose suddenly to his feet and sniffed the air  Corliss
looked up wonderingly

Huh the pocketminer grunted  Then he drew a deep breath  Cant
you smell them oranges




CHAPTER XVI

The stampede to French Hill was on by the beginning of Christmas week
Corliss and Bishop had been in no hurry to record for they looked the
ground over carefully before blazing their stakes and let a few close
friends into the secretHarney Welse Trethaway a Dutch chechaquo
who had forfeited both feet to the frost a couple of the mounted
police an old pal with whom Del had prospected through the Black Hills
Country the washerwoman at the Forks and last and notably Lucile
Corliss was responsible for her getting in on the lay and he drove and
marked her stakes himself though it fell to the colonel to deliver the
invitation to her to come and be rich

In accordance with the custom of the country those thus benefited
offered to sign over halfinterests to the two discoverers  Corliss
would not tolerate the proposition  Del was similarly minded though
swayed by no ethical reasons  He had enough as it stood  Got my
fruit ranch paid for double the size I was calculatin on he
explained and if I had any more I wouldnt know what to do with it
sure

After the strike Corliss took it upon himself as a matter of course to
look about for another man but when he brought a keeneyed Californian
into camp Del was duly wroth

Not on your life he stormed

But you are rich now Vance answered and have no need to work

Rich hell the pocketminer rejoined  Accordin to covenant you
cant fire me and Im goin to hold the job down as long as my sweet
willll let me  Savve

On Friday morning early all interested parties appeared before the
Gold Commissioner to record their claims  The news went abroad
immediately  In five minutes the first stampeders were hitting the
trail  At the end of half an hour the town was afoot  To prevent
mistakes on their propertyjumping moving of stakes and mutilation
of noticesVance and Del after promptly recording started to
return  But with the government seal attached to their holdings they
took it leisurely the stampeders sliding past them in a steady stream
Midway Del chanced to look behind  St Vincent was in sight footing
it at a lively pace the regulation stampeding pack on his shoulders
The trail made a sharp bend at that place and with the exception of
the three of them no one was in sight

Dont speak to me  Dont recognize me Del cautioned sharply as he
spoke buttoning his nosestrap across his face which served to quite
hide his identity  Theres a waterhole over there  Get down on your
belly and make a blind at gettin a drink  Then go on by your lonely
to the claims Ive business of my own to handle  And for the love of
your bother dont say a word to me or to the skunk  Dont let m see
your face

Corliss obeyed wonderingly stepping aside from the beaten path lying
down in the snow and dipping into the waterhole with an empty
condensed milkcan  Bishop bent on one knee and stooped as though
fastening his moccasin  Just as St Vincent came up with him he
finished tying the knot and started forward with the feverish haste of
a man trying to make up for lost time

I say hold on my man the correspondent called out to him

Bishop shot a hurried glance at him and pressed on  St Vincent broke
into a run till they were side by side again

Is this the way

To the benches of French Hill Del snapped him short  Betcher your
life  Thats the way Im headin  So long

He ploughed forward at a tremendous rate and the correspondent
halfrunning swung in behind with the evident intention of taking the
pace  Corliss still in the dark lifted his head and watched them go
but when he saw the pocketminer swerve abruptly to the right and take
the trail up Adams Creek the light dawned upon him and he laughed
softly to himself

Late that night Del arrived in camp on Eldorado exhausted but jubilant

Didnt do a thing to him he cried before he was half inside the
tentflaps  Gimme a bite to eat grabbing at the teapot and running
a hot flood down his throatcookinfat slush old moccasins
candleends anything

Then he collapsed upon the blankets and fell to rubbing his stiff
legmuscles while Corliss fried bacon and dished up the beans

What about m he exulted between mouthfuls  Well you can stack
your chips that he didnt get in on the French Hill benches  How far
is it my man in the wellmimicked patronizing tones of St
Vincent  How far is it with the patronage left out  How far
to French Hill weakly  How far do you think it is very weakly
with a tremolo which hinted of repressed tears  How far

The pocketminer burst into roars of laughter which were choked by a
misdirected flood of tea and which left him coughing and speechless

Whered I leave m when he had recovered  Over on the divide to
Indian River winded plumbeaten done for  Just about able to crawl
into the nearest camp and thats about all  Ive covered fifty stiff
miles myself so heres for bed  Goodnight  Dont call me in the
mornin

He turned into the blankets allstanding and as he dozed off Vance
could hear him muttering How far is it my man  I say how far is
it


Regarding Lucile Corliss was disappointed  I confess I cannot
understand her he said to Colonel Trethaway  I thought her bench
claim would make her independent of the Opera House

You cant get a dump out in a day the colonel interposed

But you can mortgage the dirt in the ground when it prospects as hers
does  Yet I took that into consideration and offered to advance her a
few thousand noninterest bearing and she declined  Said she didnt
need itin fact was really grateful thanked me and said that any
time I was short to come and see her

Trethaway smiled and played with his watchchain  What would you
Life even here certainly means more to you and me than a bit of grub
a piece of blanket and a Yukon stove  She is as gregarious as the
rest of us and probably a little more so  Suppose you cut her off
from the Opera Housewhat then  May she go up to the Barracks and
consort with the captains lady make social calls on Mrs Schoville
or chum with Frona  Dont you see  Will you escort her in daylight
down the public street

Will you Vance demanded

Ay the colonel replied unhesitatingly and with pleasure

And so will I but  He paused and gazed gloomily into the fire
But see how she is going on with St Vincent  As thick as thieves
they are and always together

Puzzles me Trethaway admitted  I can grasp St Vincents side of
it  Many irons in the fire and Lucile owns a bench claim on the
second tier of French Hill  Mark me Corliss we can tell infallibly
the day that Frona consents to go to his bed and boardif she ever
does consent

And that will be

The day St Vincent breaks with Lucile

Corliss pondered and the colonel went on

But I cant grasp Luciles side of it  What she can see in St
Vincent

Her taste is no worse thanthan that of the rest of the women Vance
broke in hotly  I am sure that

Frona could not display poor taste eh  Corliss turned on his heel
and walked out and left Colonel Trethaway smiling grimly

Vance Corliss never knew how many people directly and indirectly had
his cause at heart that Christmas week  Two men strove in particular
one for him and one for the sake of Frona  Pete Whipple an oldtimer
in the land possessed an Eldorado claim directly beneath French Hill
also a woman of the country for a wifea swarthy breed not over
pretty whose Indian mother had mated with a Russian furtrader some
thirty years before at Kutlik on the Great Delta  Bishop went down one
Sunday morning to yarn away an hour or so with Whipple but found the
wife alone in the cabin  She talked a bastard English gibberish which
was an anguish to hear so the pocketminer resolved to smoke a pipe
and depart without rudeness  But he got her tongue wagging and to
such an extent that he stopped and smoked many pipes and whenever she
lagged urged her on again  He grunted and chuckled and swore in
undertones while he listened punctuating her narrative regularly with
hells which adequately expressed the many shades of interest he felt

In the midst of it the woman fished an ancient leatherbound volume
all scarred and marred from the bottom of a dilapidated chest and
thereafter it lay on the table between them  Though it remained
unopened she constantly referred to it by look and gesture and each
time she did so a greedy light blazed in Bishops eyes  At the end
when she could say no more and had repeated herself from two to half a
dozen times he pulled out his sack  Mrs Whipple set up the gold
scales and placed the weights which he counterbalanced with a hundred
dollars worth of dust  Then he departed up the hill to the tent
hugging the purchase closely and broke in on Corliss who sat in the
blankets mending moccasins

Ill fix m yet Del remarked casually at the same time patting the
book and throwing it down on the bed

Corliss looked up inquiringly and opened it  The paper was yellow with
age and rotten from the weatherwear of trail while the text was
printed in Russian  I didnt know you were a Russian scholar Del
he quizzed  But I cant read a line of it

Neither can I mores the pity nor does Whipples woman savve the
lingo  I got it from her  But her old manhe was full Russian you
knowhe used to read it aloud to her  But she knows what she knows
and what her old man knew and so do I

And what do the three of you know

Oh thats tellin Bishop answered coyly  But you wait and watch
my smoke and when you see it risin youll know too


Matt McCarthy came in over the ice Christmas week summed up the
situation so far as Frona and St Vincent were concerned and did not
like it  Dave Harney furnished him with full information to which he
added that obtained from Lucile with whom he was on good terms
Perhaps it was because he received the full benefit of the sum of their
prejudice but no matter how he at any rate answered rollcall with
those who looked upon the correspondent with disfavor  It was
impossible for them to tell why they did not approve of the man but
somehow St Vincent was never much of a success with men  This in
turn might have been due to the fact that he shone so resplendently
with women as to cast his fellows in eclipse for otherwise in his
intercourse with men he was all that a man could wish  There was
nothing domineering or overriding about him while he manifested a
good fellowship at least equal to their own

Yet having withheld his judgment after listening to Lucile and Harney
Matt McCarthy speedily reached a verdict upon spending an hour with St
Vincent at Jacob Welsesand this in face of the fact that what
Lucile had said had been invalidated by Matts learning of her intimacy
with the man in question  Strong of friendship quick of heart and
hand Matt did not let the grass grow under his feet  Tis Ill be
takin a social fling meself as befits a mimber iv the noble Eldorado
Dynasty he explained and went up the hill to a whist party in Dave
Harneys cabin  To himself he added An belike if Satan takes his
eye off his own Ill put it to that young cub iv his

But more than once during the evening he discovered himself challenging
his own judgment  Probe as he would with his innocent wit Matt found
himself baffled  St Vincent certainly rang true  Simple
lighthearted unaffected joking and being joked in all goodnature
thoroughly democratic  Matt failed to catch the faintest echo of
insincerity

May the dogs walk on me grave he communed with himself while
studying a hand which suffered from a plethora of trumps  Is it the
years are tellin puttin the frost in me veins and chillin the
blood  A likely lad an is it for me to misjudge because his is
atakin way with the ladies  Just because the swate creatures smile
on the lad an flutter warm at the sight iv him  Bright eyes and brave
men  Tis the way they have iv lovin valor  Theyre shuddered an
shocked at the cruel an bloody dades iv war yet who so quick do they
lose their hearts to as the brave butcherbye iv a sodger  Why not
The lads done brave things and the girls give him the warm soft
smile  Small reason that for me to be callin him the devils own
cub  Out upon ye Matt McCarthy for a crusty old sourdough with
vitals frozen an summer gone from yer heart  Tis an ossification
yeve become  But bide a wee Matt bide a wee he supplemented
Wait till yeve felt the fale iv his flesh


The opportunity came shortly when St Vincent with Frona opposite
swept in the full thirteen tricks

A rampse Matt cried  Vincent me lad a rampse  Yer hand on it
me brave

It was a stout grip neither warm nor clammy but Matt shook his head
dubiously  Whats the good iv botherin he muttered to himself as
he shuffled the cards for the next deal  Ye old fool  Find out first
how Frona darlin stands an if its pat she is thin tis time for
doin

Oh McCarthys all hunky Dave Harney assured them later on coming
to the rescue of St Vincent who was getting the rough side of the
Irishmans wit  The evening was over and the company was putting on
its wraps and mittens  Didnt tell you bout his visit to the
cathedral did he when he was on the Outside  Well it was suthin
like this ez he was explainin it to me  He went to the cathedral
durin service an took in the priests and choirboys in their
surplicesparkas he called eman watched the burnin of the
holy incense  An do ye know Dave he sez to me they got in an
made a smudge and there want a darned mosquito in sight

True ivery word iv it  Matt unblushingly fathered Harneys yarn
An did ye niver hear tell iv the time Dave an me got drunk on
condensed milk

Oh  Horrors cried Mrs Schoville  But how  Do tell us

Twas durin the time iv the candle famine at Forty Mile  Cold snap
on an Dave slides into me shack to pass the time o day and glues
his eyes on me case iv condensed milk  Howd ye like a sip iv Morans
good whiskey he sez eyin the case iv milk the while  I confiss me
mouth went wet at the naked thought iv it  But whats the use iv
likin sez I with me sack bulgin with emptiness  Candles worth
tin dollars the dozen sez he a dollar apiece  Will ye give six
cans iv milk for a bottle iv the old stuff  Howll ye do it sez I
Trust me sez he  Give me the cans  Tis cold out iv doors an
Ive a pair iv candlemoulds

An its the sacred truth Im tellin ye all an if ye run across
Bill Moran hell back me word for what does Dave Harney do but lug off
me six cans freeze the milk into his candlemoulds an trade them in
to bill Moran for a bottle iv tanglefoot

As soon as he could be heard through the laughter Harney raised his
voice  Its true as McCarthy tells but hes only told you the half
Cant you guess the rest Matt

Matt shook his head

Bein short on milk myself an not over much sugar I doctored three
of your cans with water which went to make the candles  An by the
bye I had milk in my coffee for a month to come

Its on me Dave McCarthy admitted  Tis only that yer me host or
Id be shockin the ladies with yer nortorious disgraces  But Ill
lave ye live this time Dave  Come spade the partin guests we must
be movin

No ye dont ye young laddybuck he interposed as St Vincent
started to take Frona down the hill Tis her fosterdaddy sees her
home this night

McCarthy laughed in his silent way and offered his arm to Frona while
St Vincent joined in the laugh against himself dropped back and
joined Miss Mortimer and Baron Courbertin

Whats this Im hearin about you an Vincent Matt bluntly asked as
soon as they had drawn apart from the others

He looked at her with his keen gray eyes but she returned the look
quite as keenly

How should I know what you have been hearing she countered

Whin the talk goes round iv a maid an a man the one pretty an the
other not unhandsome both young an neither married does it token
aught but the one thing

Yes

An the one thing the greatest thing in all the world

Well Frona was the least bit angry and did not feel inclined to
help him

Marriage iv course he blurted out  Tis said it looks that way
with the pair of ye

But is it said that it is that way

Isnt the looks iv it enough  he demanded

No and you are old enough to know better  Mr St Vincent and Iwe
enjoy each other as friends that is all  But suppose it is as you
say what of it

Well McCarthy deliberated theres other talk goes round  Tis
said Vincent is overthick with a jade down in the townLucile they
speak iv her

All of which signifies

She waited and McCarthy watched her dumbly

I know Lucile and I like her Frona continued filling the gap of
his silence and ostentatiously manoeuvring to help him on  Do you
know her  Dont you like her

Matt started to speak cleared his throat and halted  At last in
desperation he blurted out For two cents Frona Id lay ye acrost
me knee

She laughed  You dont dare  Im not running barelegged at Dyea

Now dont be tasin he blarneyed

Im not teasing  Dont you like herLucile

An what iv it he challenged brazenly

Just what I askedwhat of it

Thin Ill tell ye in plain words from a man old enough to be yer
father  Tis undacent damnably undacent for a man to kape company
with a good young girl

Thank you she laughed dropping a courtesy  Then she added half in
bitterness There have been others who

Name me the man he cried hotly

There there go on  You were saying

That its a crying shame for a man to kape company withwith you an
at the same time be chake by jowl with a woman iv her stamp

And why

To come drippin from the muck to dirty yer claneness  An ye can ask
why

But wait Matt wait a moment  Granting your premises

Little I know iv primises he growled  Tis facts Im dalin with

Frona bit her lip  Never mind  Have it as you will but let me go on
and I will deal with facts too  When did you last see Lucile

An why are ye askin he demanded suspiciously

Never mind why  The fact

Well thin the fore part iv last night an much good may it do ye

And danced with her

A rollickin Virginia reel an not sayin a word iv a quadrille or
so  Tis at square dances I excel meself

Frona walked on in a simulated brown study no sound going up from the
twain save the complaint of the snow from under their moccasins

Well thin he questioned uneasily

An what iv it he insisted after another silence

Oh nothing she answered  I was just wondering which was the
muckiest Mr St Vincent or youor myself with whom you have both
been cheek by jowl

Now McCarthy was unversed in the virtues of social wisdom and though
he felt somehow the error of her position he could not put it into
definite thought so he steered wisely if weakly out of danger

Its gettin mad ye are with yer old Matt he insinuated who has
yer own good at heart an because iv it makes a fool iv himself

No Im not

But ye are

There leaning swiftly to him and kissing him  How could I remember
the Dyea days and be angry

Ah Frona darlin well may ye say it  Im the dust iv the dirt under
yer feet an ye may walk on meanything save get mad  I cud die for
ye swing for ye to make ye happy  I cud kill the man that gave ye
sorrow were it but a thimbleful an go plump into hell with a smile
on me face an joy in me heart

They had halted before her door and she pressed his arm gratefully
I am not angry Matt  But with the exception of my father you are the
only person I would have permitted to talk to me about thisthis
affair in the way you have  And though I like you Matt love you
better than ever I shall nevertheless be very angry if you mention it
again  You have no right  It is something that concerns me alone
And it is wrong of you

To prevint ye walkin blind into danger

If you wish to put it that way yes

He growled deep down in his throat

What is it you are saying she asked

That ye may shut me mouth but that ye cant bind me arm

But you mustnt Matt dear you mustnt

Again he answered with a subterranean murmur

And I want you to promise me now that you will not interfere in my
life that way by word or deed

Ill not promise

But you must

Ill not  Further its gettin cold on the stoop an yell be
frostin yer toes the pink little toes I fished splinters out iv at
Dyea  So its in with ye Frona girl an goodnight

He thrust her inside and departed  When he reached the corner he
stopped suddenly and regarded his shadow on the snow  Matt McCarthy
yer a damned fool  Who iver heard iv a Welse not knowin their own
mind  As though yed niver had dalins with the stiffnecked breed ye
calamitous son iv misfortune

Then he went his way still growling deeply and at every growl the
curious wolfdog at his heels bristled and bared its fangs




CHAPTER XVII

Tired

Jacob Welse put both hands on Fronas shoulders and his eyes spoke the
love his stiff tongue could not compass  The tree and the excitement
and the pleasure were over with a score or so of children had gone
home frostily happy across the snow the last guest had departed and
Christmas Eve and Christmas Day were blending into one

She returned his fondness with gladeyed interest and they dropped
into huge comfortable chairs on either side the fireplace in which the
backlog was falling to ruddy ruin

And this time next year  He put the question seemingly to the
glowing log and as if in ominous foreshadow it flared brightly and
crumbled away in a burst of sparks

It is marvellous he went on dismissing the future in an effort to
shake himself into a wholesomer frame of mind  It has been one long
continuous miracle the last few months since you have been with me
We have seen very little of each other you know since your childhood
and when I think upon it soberly it is hard to realize that you are
really mine sprung from me bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh  As
the tanglehaired wild young creature of Dyeaa healthy little
natural animal and nothing moreit required no imagination to accept
you as one of the breed of Welse  But as Frona the woman as you were
tonight as you are now as I look at you as you have been since you
came down the Yukon it is hard     I cannot realize     I   
He faltered and threw up his hands helplessly  I almost wish that I
had given you no education that I had kept you with me faring with
me adventuring with me achieving with me and failing with me  I
would have known you now as we sit by the fire  As it is I do not
To that which I did know there has been added somehow what shall I
call it a subtlety complexityfavorite words of yourswhich is
beyond me

No  He waved the speech abruptly from her lips  She came over and
knelt at his feet resting her head on his knee and clasping his hand
in firm sympathy  No that is not true  Those are not the words  I
cannot find them  I fail to say what I feel  Let me try again
Underneath all you do carry the stamp of the breed  I knew I risked
the loss of that when I sent you away but I had faith in the
persistence of the blood and I took the chance doubted and feared when
you were gone waited and prayed dumbly and hoped oftentimes
hopelessly and then the day dawned the day of days  When they said
your boat was coming death rose and walked on the one hand of me and
on the other life everlasting  Made or marred made or marredthe
words rang through my brain till they maddened me  Would the Welse
remain the Welse  Would the blood persist  Would the young shoot rise
straight and tall and strong green with sap and fresh and vigorous
Or would it droop limp and lifeless withered by the heats of the world
other than the little simple natural Dyea world

It was the day of days and yet it was a lingering watching waiting
tragedy  You know I had lived the years lonely fought the lone fight
and you away the only kin  If it had failed     But your boat
shot from the bluffs into the open and I was halfafraid to look  Men
have never called me coward but I was nearer the coward then than ever
and all before  Ay that moment I had faced death easier  And it was
foolish absurd  How could I know whether it was for good or ill when
you drifted a distant speck on the river  Still I looked and the
miracle began for I did know  You stood at the steeringsweep  You
were a Welse  It seems so little in truth it meant so much  It was
not to be expected of a mere woman but of a Welse yes  And when
Bishop went over the side and you gripped the situation as
imperatively as the sweep and your voice rang out and the Siwashes
bent their backs to your willthen was it the day of days

I tried always and remembered Frona whispered  She crept up softly
till her arm was about his neck and her head against his breast  He
rested one arm lightly on her body and poured her bright hair again
and again from his hand in glistening waves

As I said the stamp of the breed was unmarred but there was yet a
difference  There is a difference  I have watched it studied it
tried to make it out  I have sat at table proud by the side of you
but dwarfed  When you talked of little things I was large enough to
follow when of big things too small  I knew you had my hand on you
when presto and you were away goneI was lost  He is a fool who
knows not his own ignorance I was wise enough to know mine  Art
poetry musicwhat do I know of them  And they were the great
things are the great things to you mean more to you than the little
things I may comprehend  And I had hoped blindly foolishly that we
might be one in the spirit as well as the one flesh  It has been
bitter but I have faced it and understand  But to see my own red
blood get away from me elude me rise above me  It stuns  God  I
have heard you read from your Browningno no do not speakand
watched the play of your face the uplift and the passion of it and
all the while the words droning in upon me meaningless musical
maddening  And Mrs Schoville sitting there nursing an expression of
idiotic ecstasy and understanding no more than I  I could have
strangled her

Why I have stolen away at night with your Browning and locked
myself in like a thief in fear  The text was senseless I have beaten
my head with my fist like a wild man to try and knock some
comprehension into it  For my life had worked itself out along one set
groove deep and narrow  I was in the rut  I had done those things
which came to my hand and done them well but the time was past I
could not turn my hand anew  I who am strong and dominant who have
played large with destiny who could buy body and soul a thousand
painters and versifiers was baffled by a few paltry cents worth of
printed paper

He spilled her hair for a moments silence

To come back  I had attempted the impossible gambled against the
inevitable  I had sent you from me to get that which I had not
dreaming that we would still be one  As though two could be added to
two and still remain two  So to sum up the breed still holds but
you have learned an alien tongue  When you speak it I am deaf  And
bitterest of all I know that the new tongue is the greater  I do not
know why I have said all this made my confession of weakness

Oh father mine greatest of men She raised her head and laughed
into his eyes the while brushing back the thick irongray hair which
thatched the dome of his forehead  You who have wrestled more
mightily done greater things than these painters and versifiers  You
who know so well the law of change  Might not the same plaint fall
from your fathers lips were he to sit now beside you and look upon
your work and you

Yes yes  I have said that I understand  Do not let us discuss
it     a moments weakness  My father was a great man

And so mine

A struggler to the end of his days  He fought the great lone
fight

And so mine

And died fighting

And so shall mine  So shall we all we Welses

He shook her playfully in token of returning spirits  But I intend
to sell outmines Company everythingand study Browning

Still the fight  You cant discount the blood father

Why were you not a boy he demanded abruptly  You would have been
a splendid one  As it is a woman made to be the delight of some man
you must pass from metomorrow next day this time next year who
knows how soon  Ah now I know the direction my thought has been
trending  Just as I know you do so do I recognize the inevitableness
of it and the justness  But the man Frona the man

Dont she demurred  Tell me of your fathers fight the last
fight the great lone fight at Treasure City  Ten to one it was and
well fought  Tell me

No Frona  Do you realize that for the first time in our lives we
talk together seriously as father and daughterfor the first time
You have had no mother to advise no father for I trusted the blood
and wisely and let you go  But there comes a time when the mothers
counsel is needed and you you who never knew one

Frona yielded in instant recognition and waiting snuggled more
closely to him

This man St Vincenthow is it between you

I     I do not know  How do you mean

Remember always Frona that you have free choice yours is the last
word  Still I would like to understand  I could     perhaps   
I might be able to suggest  But nothing more  Still a suggestion   

There was something inexpressibly sacred about it yet she found
herself tonguetied  Instead of the one definite thing to say a
muddle of ideas fluttered in her brain  After all could he
understand  Was there not a difference which prevented him from
comprehending the motives which for her were impelling  For all her
harking back to the primitive and stout defence of its sanity and
truth did his native philosophy give him the same code which she drew
from her acquired philosophy  Then she stood aside and regarded
herself and the queries she put and drew apart from them for they
breathed of treason

There is nothing between us father she spoke up resolutely  Mr
St Vincent has said nothing nothing  We are good friends we like
each other we are very good friends  I think that is all

But you like each other you like him  Is it in the way a woman must
like a man before she can honestly share her life with him lose
herself in him  Do you feel with Ruth so that when the time comes you
can say Thy people are my people and thy God my God

No  It may be but I cannot dare not face it say it or not say
it think it or not think itnow  It is the great affirmation  When
it comes it must come no one may know how or why in a great white
flash like a revelation hiding nothing revealing everything in
dazzling blinding truth  At least I so imagine

Jacob Welse nodded his head with the slow meditation of one who
understands yet stops to ponder and weigh again

But why have you asked father  Why has Mr St Vincent been raised
I have been friends with other men

But I have not felt about other men as I do of St Vincent  We may be
truthful you and I and forgive the pain we give each other  My
opinion counts for no more than anothers  Fallibility is the
commonest of curses  Nor can I explain why I feel as I doI oppose
much in the way you expect to when your great white flash sears your
eyes  But in a word I do not like St Vincent

A very common judgment of him among the men Frona interposed driven
irresistibly to the defensive

Such consensus of opinion only makes my position stronger he
returned but not disputatively  Yet I must remember that I look upon
him as men look  His popularity with women must proceed from the fact
that women look differently than men just as women do differ
physically and spiritually from men  It is deep too deep for me to
explain  I but follow my nature and try to be just

But have you nothing more definite she asked groping for better
comprehension of his attitude  Can you not put into some sort of
coherence some one certain thing of the things you feel

I hardly dare  Intuitions can rarely be expressed in terms of
thought  But let me try  We Welses have never known a coward  And
where cowardice is nothing can endure  It is like building on sand
or like a vile disease which rots and rots and we know not when it may
break forth

But it seems to me that Mr St Vincent is the last man in the world
with whom cowardice may be associated  I cannot conceive of him in
that light

The distress in her face hurt him  I know nothing against St
Vincent  There is no evidence to show that he is anything but what he
appears  Still I cannot help feeling it in my fallible human way
Yet there is one thing I have heard a sordid pothouse brawl in the
Opera House  Mind you Frona I say nothing against the brawl or the
placemen are men but it is said that he did not act as a man ought
that night

But as you say father men are men  We would like to have them other
than they are for the world surely would be better but we must take
them as they are  Lucile

No no you misunderstand  I did not refer to her but to the fight
He did not     he was cowardly

But as you say it is said  He told me about it not long
afterwards and I do not think he would have dared had there been
anything

But I do not make it as a charge Jacob Welse hastily broke in
Merely hearsay and the prejudice of the men would be sufficient to
account for the tale  And it has no bearing anyway  I should not
have brought it up for I have known good men funk in my timebuck
fever as it were  And now let us dismiss it all from our minds  I
merely wished to suggest and I suppose I have bungled  But understand
this Frona turning her face up to his understand above all things
and in spite of them first last and always that you are my
daughter and that I believe your life is sacredly yours not mine
yours to deal with and to make or mar  Your life is yours to live and
in so far that I influence it you will not have lived your life nor
would your life have been yours  Nor would you have been a Welse for
there was never a Welse yet who suffered dictation  They died first
or went away to pioneer on the edge of things

Why if you thought the dance house the proper or natural medium for
selfexpression I might be sad but tomorrow I would sanction your
going down to the Opera House  It would be unwise to stop you and
further it is not our way  The Welses have ever stood by in many a
lost cause and forlorn hope knee to knee and shoulder to shoulder
Conventions are worthless for such as we  They are for the swine who
without them would wallow deeper  The weak must obey or be crushed
not so with the strong  The mass is nothing the individual
everything and it is the individual always that rules the mass and
gives the law  A fig for what the world says  If the Welse should
procreate a bastard line this day it would be the way of the Welse
and you would be a daughter of the Welse and in the face of hell and
heaven of God himself we would stand together we of the one blood
Frona you and I

You are larger than I she whispered kissing his forehead and the
caress of her lips seemed to him the soft impact of a leaf falling
through the still autumn air

And as the heat of the room ebbed away he told of her foremother and
of his and of the sturdy Welse who fought the great lone fight and
died fighting at Treasure City




CHAPTER XVIII

The Dolls House was a success  Mrs Schoville ecstasized over it in
terms so immeasurable so unqualifiable that Jacob Welse standing
near bent a glittering gaze upon her plump white throat and
unconsciously clutched and closed his hand on an invisible windpipe
Dave Harney proclaimed its excellence effusively though he questioned
the soundness of Noras philosophy and swore by his Puritan gods that
Torvald was the longesteared Jack in two hemispheres  Even Miss
Mortimer antagonistic as she was to the whole school conceded that
the players had redeemed it while Matt McCarthy announced that he
didnt blame Nora darlin the least bit though he told the Gold
Commissioner privately that a song or so and a skirt dance wouldnt
have hurt the performance

Iv course the Nora girl was right he insisted to Harney both of
whom were walking on the heels of Frona and St Vincent  Id be
seein

Rubber

Rubber yer granmother Matt wrathfully exclaimed

Ez I was sayin Harney continued imperturbably rubber boots is
goin to go skyhigh bout the time of washup  Three ounces the pair
an you kin put your chips on that for a high card  You kin gather em
in now for an ounce a pair and clear two on the deal  A cinch Matt a
dead open an shut

The devil take you an yer cinches  Its Nora darlin I have in me
mind the while

They bade goodby to Frona and St Vincent and went off disputing under
the stars in the direction of the Opera House

Gregory St Vincent heaved an audible sigh  At last

At last what Frona asked incuriously

At last the first opportunity for me to tell you how well you did
You carried off the final scene wonderfully so well that it seemed you
were really passing out of my life forever

What a misfortune

It was terrible

No

But yes  I took the whole condition upon myself  You were not Nora
you were Frona nor I Torvald but Gregory  When you made your exit
capped and jacketed and travellingbag in hand it seemed I could not
possibly stay and finish my lines  And when the door slammed and you
were gone the only thing that saved me was the curtain  It brought me
to myself or else I would have rushed after you in the face of the
audience

It is strange how a simulated part may react upon one Frona
speculated

Or rather  St Vincent suggested

Frona made no answer and they walked on without speech  She was still
under the spell of the evening and the exaltation which had come to
her as Nora had not yet departed  Besides she read between the lines
of St Vincents conversation and was oppressed by the timidity which
comes over woman when she faces man on the verge of the greater
intimacy

It was a clear cold night not overcoldnot more than forty
belowand the land was bathed in a soft diffused flood of light
which found its source not in the stars nor yet in the moon which was
somewhere over on the other side of the world  From the southeast to
the northwest a palegreenish glow fringed the rim of the heavens and
it was from this the dim radiance was exhaled

Suddenly like the ray of a searchlight a band of white light
ploughed overhead  Night turned to ghostly day on the instant then
blacker night descended  But to the southeast a noiseless commotion
was apparent  The glowing greenish gauze was in a ferment bubbling
uprearing downfalling and tentatively thrusting huge bodiless hands
into the upper ether  Once more a cyclopean rocket twisted its fiery
way across the sky from horizon to zenith and on and on in
tremendous flight to horizon again  But the span could not hold and
in its wake the black night brooded  And yet again broader stronger
deeper lavishly spilling streamers to right and left it flaunted the
midmost zenith with its gorgeous flare and passed on and down to the
further edge of the world  Heaven was bridged at last and the bridge
endured

At this flaming triumph the silence of earth was broken and ten
thousand wolfdogs in longdrawn unisoned howls sobbed their dismay
and grief  Frona shivered and St Vincent passed his arm about her
waist  The woman in her was aware of the touch of man and of a slight
tingling thrill of vague delight but she made no resistance  And as
the wolfdogs mourned at her feet and the aurora wantoned overhead she
felt herself drawn against him closely

Need I tell my story he whispered

She drooped her head in tired content on his shoulder and together
they watched the burning vault wherein the stars dimmed and vanished
Ebbing flowing pulsing to some tremendous rhythm the prism colors
hurled themselves in luminous deluge across the firmament  Then the
canopy of heaven became a mighty loom wherein imperial purple and deep
seagreen blended wove and interwove with blazing woof and flashing
warp till the most delicate of tulles fluorescent and bewildering
was daintily and airily shaken in the face of the astonished night

Without warning the span was sundered by an arrogant arm of black  The
arch dissolved in blushing confusion  Chasms of blackness yawned
grew and rushed together  Broken masses of strayed color and fading
fire stole timidly towards the skyline  Then the dome of night
towered imponderable immense and the stars came back one by one and
the wolfdogs mourned anew

I can offer you so little dear the man said with a slightly
perceptible bitterness  The precarious fortunes of a gypsy wanderer

And the woman placing his hand and pressing it against her heart
said as a great woman had said before her A tent and a crust of
bread with you Richard




CHAPTER XIX

Howha was only an Indian woman bred of a long line of fisheating
meatrending carnivores and her ethics were as crude and simple as
her blood  But long contact with the whites had given her an insight
into their way of looking at things and though she grunted
contemptuously in her secret soul she none the less understood their
way perfectly  Ten years previous she had cooked for Jacob Welse
and served him in one fashion or another ever since and when on a
dreary January morning she opened the front door in response to the
deeptongued knocker even her stolid presence was shaken as she
recognized the visitor  Not that the average man or woman would have
so recognized  But Howhas faculties of observing and remembering
details had been developed in a hard school where death dealt his
blow to the lax and life saluted the vigilant

Howha looked up and down the woman who stood before her  Through
the heavy veil she could barely distinguish the flash of the eyes
while the hood of the parka effectually concealed the hair and the
parka proper the particular outlines of the body  But Howha
paused and looked again  There was something familiar in the vague
general outline  She quested back to the shrouded head again and
knew the unmistakable poise  Then Howhas eyes went blear as she
traversed the simple windings of her own brain inspecting the bare
shelves taciturnly stored with the impressions of a meagre life  No
disorder no confused mingling of records no devious and
interminable impress of complex emotions tangled theories and
bewildering abstractionsnothing but simple facts neatly classified
and conveniently collated  Unerringly from the stores of the past
she picked and chose and put together in the instant present till
obscurity dropped from the woman before her and she knew her word
and deed and look and history

Much better you go way quicketyquick Howha informed her

Miss Welse  I wish to see her

The strange woman spoke in firm even tones which betokened the will
behind but which failed to move Howha

Much better you go she repeated stolidly

Here take this to Frona Welse andah would you thrusting her
knee between the door and jamb and leave the door open

Howha scowled but took the note for she could not shake off the
grip of the ten years of servitude to the superior race


  May I see you

     LUCILE


So the note ran  Frona glanced up expectantly at the Indian woman

Um kick toes outside Howha explained  Me tell um go way
quicketyquick  Eh  You tink yes  Um no good  Um

No  Take herFrona was thinking quicklyno bring her up
here

Much better

Go

Howha grunted and yielded up the obedience she could not withhold
though as she went down the stairs to the door in a tenebrous
glimmering way she wondered that the accident of white skin or swart
made master or servant as the case might be

In the one sweep of vision Lucile took in Frona smiling with
extended hand in the foreground the dainty dressingtable the
simple finery the thousand girlish evidences and with the sweet
wholesomeness of it pervading her nostrils her own girlhood rose up
and smote her  Then she turned a bleak eye and cold ear on outward
things

I am glad you came Frona was saying  I have so wanted to see
you again andbut do get that heavy parka off please  How thick
it is and what splendid fur and workmanship

Yes from Siberia  A present from St Vincent Lucile felt like
adding but said instead The Siberians have not yet learned to
scamp their work you know

She sank down into the lowseated rocker with a native grace which
could not escape the beautyloving eye of the girl and with
proudpoised head and silent tongue listened to Frona as the minutes
ticked away and observed with impersonal amusement Fronas painful
toil at making conversation

What has she come for Frona asked herself as she talked on furs
and weather and indifferent things

If you do not say something Lucile I shall get nervous soon she
ventured at last in desperation  Has anything happened

Lucile went over to the mirror and picked up from among the trinkets
beneath a tiny openwork miniature of Frona  This is you  How old
were you

Sixteen

A sylph but a cold northern one

The blood warms late with us Frona reproved but is

None the less warm for that Lucile laughed  And how old are you
now

Twenty

Twenty Lucile repeated slowly  Twenty and resumed her seat
You are twenty  And I am twentyfour

So little difference as that

But our blood warms early  Lucile voiced her reproach across the
unfathomable gulf which four years could not plumb

Frona could hardly hide her vexation  Lucile went over and looked at
the miniature again and returned

What do you think of love she asked abruptly her face softening
unheralded into a smile

Love the girl quavered

Yes love  What do you know about it  What do you think of it

A flood of definitions glowing and rosy sped to her tongue but
Frona swept them aside and answered Love is immolation

Very goodsacrifice  And now does it pay

Yes it pays  Of course it pays  Who can doubt it

Luciles eyes twinkled amusedly

Why do you smile Frona asked

Look at me Frona  Lucile stood up and her face blazed  I am
twentyfour  Not altogether a fright not altogether a dunce  I
have a heart  I have good red blood and warm  And I have loved  I
do not remember the pay  I know only that I have paid

And in the paying were paid Frona took up warmly  The price was
the reward  If love be fallible yet you have loved you have done
you have served  What more would you

The whelpage love Lucile sneered

Oh  You are unfair

I do you justice Lucile insisted firmly  You would tell me that
you know that you have gone unveiled and seen cleareyed that
without placing more than lips to the brim you have divined the taste
of the dregs and that the taste is good  Bah  The whelpage love
And oh Frona I know you are full womanly and broad and lend no
ear to little things butshe tapped a slender finger to
foreheadit is all here  It is a heady brew and you have smelled
the fumes overmuch  But drain the dregs turn down the glass and
say that it is good  No God forbid she cried passionately
There are good loves  You should find no masquerade but one fair
and shining

Frona was up to her old tricktheir common oneand her hand slid
down Luciles arm till hand clasped in hand  You say things which I
feel are wrong yet may not answer  I can but how dare I  I dare
not put mere thoughts against your facts  I who have lived so
little cannot in theory give the lie to you who have lived so
much

For he who lives more lives than one more lives than one must
die

From out of her pain Lucile spoke the words of her pain and Frona
throwing arms about her sobbed on her breast in understanding  As
for Lucile the slight nervous ingathering of the brows above her
eyes smoothed out and she pressed the kiss of motherhood lightly
and secretly on the others hair  For a spacethen the brows
ingathered the lips drew firm and she put Frona from her

You are going to marry Gregory St Vincent

Frona was startled  It was only a fortnight old and not a word had
been breathed  How do you know

You have answered  Lucile watched Fronas open face and the bold
running advertisement and felt as the skilled fencer who fronts a
tyro weak of wrist each opening naked to his hand  How do I
know  She laughed harshly  When a man leaves ones arms suddenly
lips wet with last kisses and mouth areek with last lies

And

Forgets the way back to those arms

So  The blood of the Welse pounded up and like a hot sun dried
the mists from her eyes and left them flashing  Then that is why
you came  I could have guessed it had I given second thought to
Dawsons gossip

It is not too late Luciles lip curled  And it is your way

And I am mindful  What is it  Do you intend telling me what he has
done what he has been to you  Let me say that it is useless  He is
a man as you and I are women

No Lucile lied swallowing her astonishment

I had not thought that any action of his would affect you  I knew
you were too great for that  Buthave you considered me

Frona caught her breath for a moment  Then she straightened out her
arms to hold the man in challenge to the arms of Lucile

Your father over again Lucile exclaimed  Oh you impossible
Welses

But he is not worthy of you Frona Welse she continued of me
yes  He is not a nice man a great man nor a good  His love cannot
match with yours  Bah  He does not possess love passion of one
sort and another is the best he may lay claim to  That you do not
want  It is all at the best he can give you  And you pray what
may you give him  Yourself  A prodigious waste  But your fathers
yellow

Dont go on or I shall refuse to listen  It is wrong of you  So
Frona made her cease and then with bold inconsistency And what
may the woman Lucile give him

Some few wild moments was the prompt response a burning burst of
happiness and the regrets of hellwhich latter he deserves as do
I  So the balance is maintained and all is well

Butbut

For there is a devil in him she held on a most alluring devil
which delights me on my soul it does and which pray God Frona
you may never know  For you have no devil mine matches his and
mates  I am free to confess that the whole thing is only an
attraction  There is nothing permanent about him nor about me  And
theres the beauty the balance is preserved

Frona lay back in her chair and lazily regarded her visitor Lucile
waited for her to speak  It was very quiet

Well Lucile at last demanded in a low curious tone at the same
time rising to slip into her parka

Nothing  I was only waiting

I am done

Then let me say that I do not understand you Frona summed up
coldly  I cannot somehow just catch your motive  There is a flat
ring to what you have said  However of this I am sure for some
unaccountable reason you have been untrue to yourself today  Do not
ask me for as I said before I do not know where or how yet I am
none the less convinced  This I do know you are not the Lucile I
met by the wood trail across the river  That was the true Lucile
little though I saw of her  The woman who is here today is a
strange woman  I do not know her  Sometimes it has seemed she was
Lucile but rarely  This woman has lied lied to me and lied to me
about herself  As to what she said of the man at the worst that is
merely an opinion  It may be she has lied about him likewise  The
chance is large that she has  What do you think about it

That you are a very clever girl Frona  That you speak sometimes
more truly than you know and that at others you are blinder than you
dream

There is something I could love in you but you have hidden it away
so that I cannot find it

Luciles lips trembled on the verge of speech  But she settled her
parka about her and turned to go

Frona saw her to the door herself and Howha pondered over the white
who made the law and was greater than the law

When the door had closed Lucile spat into the street  Faugh  St
Vincent  I have defiled my mouth with your name  And she spat
again


Come in

At the summons Matt McCarthy pulled the latchstring pushed the door
open and closed it carefully behind him

Oh it is you  St Vincent regarded his visitor with dark
abstraction then recollecting himself held out his hand  Why
hello Matt old man  My mind was a thousand miles away when you
entered  Take a stool and make yourself comfortable  Theres the
tobacco by your hand  Take a try at it and give us your verdict

An well may his mind be a thousand miles away Matt assured
himself for in the dark he had passed a woman on the trail who
looked suspiciously like Lucile  But aloud Sure an its
daydramin ye mane  An small wondher

Hows that the correspondent asked cheerily

By the same token that I met Lucile down the trail a piece an the
heels iv her moccasins pointing to yer shack  Its a bitter tongue
the jade slings on occasion Matt chuckled

Thats the worst of it  St Vincent met him frankly  A man looks
sidewise at them for a passing moment and they demand that the
moment be eternal

Off with the old loves a stiff proposition eh

I should say so  And you understand  Its easy to see Matt
youve had some experience in your time

In me time  Ill have ye know Im not too old to still enjoy a bit
iv a fling

Certainly certainly  One can read it in your eyes  The warm heart
and the roving eye Matt  He slapped his visitor on the shoulder
with a hearty laugh

An Ive none the best iv ye Vincent  Tis a wicked lad ye are
with a takin way with the ladiesas plain as the nose on yer face
Mannys the idle kiss yeve given an mannys the heart yeve broke
But Vincent bye did ye iver know the rale thing

How do you mean

The rale thing the rale thingthat iswell have ye been iver a
father

St Vincent shook his head

And niver have I  But have ye felt the love iv a father thin

I hardly know  I dont think so

Well I have  An its the rale thing Ill tell ye  If iver a man
suckled a child I did or the next door to it  A girl child at
that an shes woman grown now an if the thing is possible I
love her more than her own bloodfather  Bad luck exciptin her
there was niver but one woman I loved an that woman had mated
beforetime  Not a soul did I brathe a word to trust me nor even
herself  But she died  Gods love be with her

His chin went down upon his chest and he quested back to a
flaxenhaired Saxon woman strayed like a bit of sunshine into the
log store by the Dyea River  He looked up suddenly and caught St
Vincents stare bent blankly to the floor as he mused on other things

A truce to foolishness Vincent

The correspondent returned to himself with an effort and found the
Irishmans small blue eyes boring into him

Are ye a brave man Vincent

For a seconds space they searched each others souls  And in that
space Matt could have sworn he saw the faintest possible flicker or
flutter in the mans eyes

He brought his fist down on the table with a triumphant crash  By
God yer not

The correspondent pulled the tobacco jug over to him and rolled a
cigarette  He rolled it carefully the delicate rice paper crisping
in his hand without a tremor but all the while a red tide mounting
up from beneath the collar of his shirt deepening in the hollows of
the cheeks and thinning against the cheekbones above creeping
spreading till all his face was aflame

Tis good  An likely it saves me fingers a dirty job  Vincent
man the girl child which is woman grown slapes in Dawson this night
God help us you an me but well niver hit again the pillow as
clane an pure as she  Vincent a word to the wise yell niver lay
holy hand or otherwise upon her

The devil which Lucile had proclaimed began to quickena fuming
fretting irrational devil

I do not like ye  I kape me raysons to meself  It is sufficient
But take this to heart an take it well should ye be mad enough to
make her yer wife iv that damned day yell niver see the inding nor
lay eye upon the bridal bed  Why man I cud bate ye to death with
me two fists if need be  But its to be hoped Ill do a nater job
Rest aisy  I promise ye

You Irish pig

So the devil burst forth and all unaware for McCarthy found himself
eyehigh with the muzzle of a Colts revolver

Is it loaded he asked  I belave ye  But why are ye lingerin
Lift the hammer will ye

The correspondents triggerfinger moved and there was a warning
click

Now pull it  Pull it I say  As though ye cud with that flutter
to yer eye

St Vincent attempted to turn his head aside

Look at me man McCarthy commanded  Kape yer eyes on me when ye
do it

Unwillingly the sideward movement was arrested and his eyes returned
and met the Irishmans

Now

St Vincent ground his teeth and pulled the triggerat least he
thought he did as men think they do things in dreams  He willed the
deed flashed the order forth but the flutter of his soul stopped it

Tis paralyzed is it that shaky little finger  Matt grinned into
the face of the tortured man  Now turn it aside so an drop it
gently    gently    gently  His voice crooned away in
soothing diminuendo

When the trigger was safely down St Vincent let the revolver fall
from his hand and with a slight audible sigh sank nervelessly upon a
stool  He tried to straighten himself but instead dropped down upon
the table and buried his face in his palsied hands  Matt drew on his
mittens looking down upon him pityingly the while and went out
closing the door softly behind him




CHAPTER XX

Where nature shows the rough hand the sons of men are apt to respond
with kindred roughness  The amenities of life spring up only in mellow
lands where the sun is warm and the earth fat  The damp and soggy
climate of Britain drives men to strong drink the rosy Orient lures to
the dream splendors of the lotus  The bigbodied whiteskinned
northern dweller rude and ferocious bellows his anger uncouthly and
drives a gross fist into the face of his foe  The supple
southsojourner silken of smile and lazy of gesture waits and does
his work from behind when no man looketh gracefully and without
offence  Their ends are one the difference lies in their ways and
therein the climate and the cumulative effect thereof is the
determining factor  Both are sinners as men born of women have ever
been but the one does his sin openly in the clear sight of God the
otheras though God could not seeveils his iniquity with shimmering
fancies hiding it like it were some splendid mystery

These be the ways of men each as the sun shines upon him and the wind
blows against him according to his kind and the seed of his father
and the milk of his mother  Each is the resultant of many forces which
go to make a pressure mightier than he and which moulds him in the
predestined shape  But with sound legs under him he may run away
and meet with a new pressure  He may continue running each new
pressure prodding him as he goes until he dies and his final form will
be that predestined of the many pressures  An exchange of
cradlebabes and the baseborn slave may wear the purple imperially
and the royal infant begs an alms as wheedlingly or cringe to the lash
as abjectly as his meanest subject  A Chesterfield with an empty
belly chancing upon good fare will gorge as faithfully as the swine
in the next sty  And an Epicurus in the dirtigloo of the Eskimos
will wax eloquent over the whale oil and walrus blubber or die

Thus in the young Northland frosty and grim and menacing men
stripped off the sloth of the south and gave battle greatly  And they
stripped likewise much of the veneer of civilizationall of its
follies most of its foibles and perhaps a few of its virtues  Maybe
so but they reserved the great traditions and at least lived frankly
laughed honestly and looked one another in the eyes

And so it is not well for women born south of fiftythree and reared
gently to knock loosely about the Northland unless they be great of
heart  They may be soft and tender and sensitive possessed of eyes
which have not lost the lustre and the wonder and of ears used only to
sweet sounds but if their philosophy is sane and stable large enough
to understand and to forgive they will come to no harm and attain
comprehension  If not they will see things and hear things which
hurt and they will suffer greatly and lose faith in manwhich is the
greatest evil that may happen them  Such should be sedulously
cherished and it were well to depute this to their menfolk the
nearer of kin the better  In line it were good policy to seek out a
cabin on the hill overlooking Dawson orbest of allacross the Yukon
on the western bank  Let them not move abroad unheralded and
unaccompanied and the hillside back of the cabin may be recommended as
a fit field for stretching muscles and breathing deeply a place where
their ears may remain undefiled by the harsh words of men who strive to
the utmost


Vance Corliss wiped the last tin dish and filed it away on the shelf
lighted his pipe and rolled over on his back on the bunk to
contemplate the mosschinked roof of his French Hill cabin  This
French Hill cabin stood on the last dip of the hill into Eldorado
Creek close to the maintravelled trail and its one window blinked
cheerily of nights at those who journeyed late

The door was kicked open and Del Bishop staggered in with a load of
firewood  His breath had so settled on his face in a white rime that
he could not speak  Such a condition was ever a hardship with the man
so he thrust his face forthwith into the quivering heat above the
stove  In a trice the frost was started and the thawed streamlets
dancing madly on the whitehot surface beneath  Then the ice began to
fall from is beard in chunks rattling on the lidtops and simmering
spitefully till spurted upward in clouds of steam

And so you witness an actual phenomenon illustrative of the three
forms of matter Vance laughed mimicking the monotonous tones of the
demonstrator solid liquid and vapor  In another moment you will
have the gas

Thththats all very well Bishop spluttered wrestling with an
obstructing piece of ice until it was wrenched from his upper lip and
slammed stoveward with a bang

How cold do you make it Del  Fifty

Fifty the pocketminer demanded with unutterable scorn wiping his
face  Quicksilvers been solid for hours and its been gittin
colder an colder ever since  Fifty  Ill bet my new mittens against
your old moccasins that it aint a notch below seventy

Think so

Dye want to bet

Vance nodded laughingly

Centigrade or Fahrenheit Bishop asked suddenly suspicious

Oh well if you want my old moccasins so badly Vance rejoined
feigning to be hurt by the others lack of faith why you can have
them without betting

Del snorted and flung himself down on the opposite bunk  Think yer
funny dont you  No answer forthcoming he deemed the retort
conclusive rolled over and fell to studying the moss chinks

Fifteen minutes of this diversion sufficed  Play you a rubber of crib
before bed he challenged across to the other bunk

Ill go you Corliss got up stretched and moved the kerosene lamp
from the shelf to the table Think it will hold out he asked
surveying the oillevel through the cheap glass

Bishop threw down the cribboard and cards and measured the contents
of the lamp with his eye  Forgot to fill it didnt I  Too late now
Do it tomorrow  Itll last the rubber out sure

Corliss took up the cards but paused in the shuffling  Weve a big
trip before us Del about a month from now the middle of March as
near as I can plan itup the Stuart River to McQuestion up
McQuestion and back again down the Mayo then across country to Mazy
May winding up at Henderson Creek

On the Indian River

No Corliss replied as he dealt the hands just below where the
Stuart taps the Yukon  And then back to Dawson before the ice breaks

The pocketminers eyes sparkled  Keep us hustlin but say its a
trip isnt it  Hunch

Ive received word from the Parker outfit on the Mayo and McPherson
isnt asleep on Hendersonyou dont know him  Theyre keeping quiet
and of course one cant tell but   

Bishop nodded his head sagely while Corliss turned the trump he had
cut  A sure vision of a twentyfour hand was dazzling him when
there was a sound of voices without and the door shook to a heavy knock

Come in he bawled  An dont make such a row about it  Look at
thatto Corliss at the same time facing his handfifteeneight
fifteensixteen and eight are twentyfour  Just my luck

Corliss started swiftly to his feet  Bishop jerked his head about
Two women and a man had staggered clumsily in through the door and
were standing just inside momentarily blinded by the light

By all the Prophets  Cornell  The pocketminer wrung the mans hand
and led him forward  You recollect Cornell Corliss  Jake Cornell
ThirtySeven and a Half Eldorado

How could I forget the engineer acknowledged warmly shaking his
hand  That was a miserable night you put us up last fall about as
miserable as the moosesteak was good that you gave us for breakfast

Jake Cornell hirsute and cadaverous of aspect nodded his head with
emphasis and deposited a corpulent demijohn on the table  Again he
nodded his head and glared wildly about him  The stove caught his eye
and he strode over to it lifted a lid and spat out a mouthful of
ambercolored juice  Another stride and he was back

Course I recollect the night he rumbled the ice clattering from
his hairy jaws  And Im danged glad to see you thats a fact  He
seemed suddenly to remember himself and added a little sheepishly
The fact is were all danged glad to see you aint we girls  He
twisted his head about and nodded his companions up  Blanche my
dear Mr Corlisshemit gives me    hem    it gives me
pleasure to make you acquainted  Cariboo Blanche sir  Cariboo
Blanche

Pleased to meet you  Cariboo Blanche put out a frank hand and looked
him over keenly  She was a fairfeatured blondish woman originally
not unpleasing of appearance but now with lines all deepened and
hardened as on the faces of men who have endured much weatherbeat

Congratulating himself upon his social proficiency Jake Cornell
cleared his throat and marshalled the second woman to the front  Mr
Corliss the Virgin I make you both acquainted  Hem in response to
the query in Vances eyesYes the Virgin  Thats all just the
Virgin

She smiled and bowed but did not shake hands  A toff was her secret
comment upon the engineer and from her limited experience she had been
led to understand that it was not good form among toffs to shake
hands

Corliss fumbled his hand then bowed and looked at her curiously  She
was a pretty lowbrowed creature darkly pretty with a wellfavored
body and for all that the type was mean he could not escape the charm
of her overbrimming vitality  She seemed bursting with it and every
quick spontaneous movement appeared to spring from very excess of red
blood and superabundant energy

Pretty healthy proposition aint she Jake Cornell demanded
following his hosts gaze with approval

None o your gammon Jake the Virgin snapped back with lip curled
contemptuously for Vances especial benefit  I fancy itd be more in
keeping if youd look to pore Blanche there

Fact is were plum ding dong played out Jake said  An Blanche
went through the ice just down the trail and her feets like to
freezin

Blanche smiled as Corliss piloted her to a stool by the fire and her
stern mouth gave no indication of the pain she was suffering  He
turned away when the Virgin addressed herself to removing the wet
footgear while Bishop went rummaging for socks and moccasins

Didnt go in moren to the ankles Cornell explained confidentially
but thats plenty a night like this

Corliss agreed with a nod of the head

Spotted your light andhemand so we come  Dont mind do you

Why certainly not

No intrudin

Corliss reassured him by laying hand on his shoulder and cordially
pressing him to a seat  Blanche sighed luxuriously  Her wet stockings
were stretched up and already steaming and her feet basking in the
capacious warmth of Bishops Siwash socks  Vance shoved the tobacco
canister across but Cornell pulled out a handful of cigars and passed
them around

Uncommon bad piece of trail just this side of the turn he remarked
stentoriously at the same time flinging an eloquent glance at the
demijohn  Ice rotten from the springs and no sign till youre into
it  Turning to the woman by the stove Howre you feeling Blanche

Tony she responded stretching her body lazily and redisposing her
feet though my legs aint as limber as when we pulled out

Looking to his host for consent Cornell tilted the demijohn over his
arm and partly filled the four tin mugs and an empty jelly glass

Wots the matter with a toddy the Virgin broke in or a punch

Got any lime juice she demanded of Corliss

You ave  Jolly  She directed her dark eyes towards Del  Ere
you cookie  Trot out your mixingpan and sling the kettle for ot
water  Come on  All hands  Jakes treat and Ill show you ow  Any
sugar Mr Corliss  And nutmeg  Cinnamon then  OK  Itll do
Lively now cookie

Aint she a peach Cornell confided to Vance watching her with
mellow eyes as she stirred the steaming brew

But the Virgin directed her attentions to the engineer  Dont mind
im sir she advised  Es moren arfgorn aready aitting the
jug every blessed stop

Now my dear Jake protested

Dont you mydear me she sniffed  I dont like you

Why

Cos     She ladled the punch carefully into the mugs and
meditated  Cos you chew tobacco  Cos youre whiskery  Wot I take to
is smoothfaced young chaps

Dont take any stock in her nonsense the Fraction King warned She
just does it apurpose to get me mad

Now then she commanded sharply  Step up to your licker  Eres
ow

Whatll it be cried Blanche from the stove

The elevated mugs wavered and halted

The Queen Gawd bless er the Virgin toasted promptly

And Bill Del Bishop interrupted

Again the mugs wavered

Bill oo the Virgin asked suspiciously

McKinley

She favored him with a smile  Thank you cookie youre a trump
Now  Eres a go gents  Take it standing  The Queen Gawd bless
er and Bill McKinley

Bottoms up thundered Jake Cornell and the mugs smote the table with
clanging rims

Vance Corliss discovered himself amused and interested  According to
Frona he mused ironicallythis was learning life was adding to his
sum of human generalizations  The phrase was hers and he rolled it
over a couple of times  Then again her engagement with St Vincent
crept into his thought and he charmed the Virgin by asking her to
sing  But she was coy and only after Bishop had rendered the several
score stanzas of Flying Cloud did she comply  Her voice in a weakly
way probably registered an octave and a half below that point it
underwent strange metamorphoses while on the upper levels it was
devious and rickety  Nevertheless she sang Take Back Your Gold with
touching effect which brought a fiery moisture into the eyes of the
Fraction King who listened greedily for the time being experiencing
unwonted ethical yearnings

The applause was generous followed immediately by Bishop who toasted
the singer as the Enchantress of Bow Bells to the reverberating
bottoms up of Jake Cornell


Two hours later Frona Welse rapped  It was a sharp insistent rap
penetrating the din within and bringing Corliss to the door

She gave a glad little cry when she saw who it was  Oh it is you
Vance  I didnt know you lived here

He shook hands and blocked the doorway with his body  Behind him the
Virgin was laughing and Jake Cornell  roaring

  Oh cable this message along the track
  The Prods out West but hes coming back
  Put plenty of veal for one on the rack
    Trolla lala la la la la la


What is it Vance questioned  Anything up

I think you might ask me in  There was a hint of reproach in Fronas
voice and of haste  I blundered through the ice and my feet are
freezing

O Gawd in the exuberant tones of the Virgin came whirling over
Vances shoulder and the voices of Blanche and Bishop joining in a
laugh against Cornell and that worthys vociferous protestations  It
seemed to him that all the blood of his body had rushed into his face
But you cant come in Frona  Dont you hear them

But I must she insisted  My feet are freezing

With a gesture of resignation he stepped aside and closed the door
after her  Coming suddenly in from the darkness she hesitated a
moment but in that moment recovered her sight and took in the scene
The air was thick with tobacco smoke and the odor of it in the close
room was sickening to one fresh from the pure outside  On the table a
column of steam was ascending from the big mixingpan  The Virgin
fleeing before Cornell was defending herself with a long mustard
spoon  Evading him and watching her chance she continually daubed his
nose and cheeks with the yellow smear  Blanche had twisted about from
the stove to see the fun and Del Bishop with a mug at rest halfway
to his lips was applauding the successive strokes  The faces of all
were flushed

Vance leaned nervelessly against the door  The whole situation seemed
so unthinkably impossible  An insane desire to laugh came over him
which resolved itself into a coughing fit  But Frona realizing her
own pressing need by the growing absence of sensation in her feet
stepped forward

Hello Del she called

The mirth froze on his face at the familiar sound and he slowly and
unwilling turned his head to meet her  She had slipped the hood of her
parka back and her face outlined against the dark fur rosy with the
cold and bright was like a shaft of the sun shot into the murk of a
boozingken  They all knew her for who did not know Jacob Welses
daughter  The Virgin dropped the mustardspoon with a startled shriek
while Cornell passing a dazed hand across his yellow markings and
consummating the general smear collapsed on the nearest stool
Cariboo Blanche alone retained her selfpossession and laughed softly

Bishop managed to articulate Hello but was unable to stave off the
silence which settled down

Frona waited a second and then said Goodevening all

This way  Vance had recovered himself and seated her by the stove
opposite Blanche  Better get your things off quickly and be careful
of the heat  Ill see what I can find for you

Some cold water please she asked  It will take the frost out
Del will get it

I hope it is not serious

No  She shook her head and smiled up to him at the same time
working away at her icecoated moccasins  There hasnt been time for
more than surfacefreezing  At the worst the skin will peel off

An unearthly silence brooded in the cabin broken only by Bishop
filling a basin from the waterbucket and by Corliss seeking out his
smallest and daintiest housemoccasins and his warmest socks

Frona rubbing her feet vigorously paused and looked up  Dont let
me chill the festivities just because Im cold she laughed  Please
go on

Jake Cornell straightened up and cleared his throat inanely and the
Virgin looked overdignified but Blanche came over and took the towel
out of Fronas hands

I wet my feet in the same place she said kneeling down and bringing
a glow to the frosted feet

I suppose you can manage some sort of a fit with them  Here  Vance
tossed over the housemoccasins and woollen wrappings which the two
women with low laughs and confidential undertones proceeded to
utilize

But what in the world were you doing on trail alone at this time of
night Vance asked  In his heart he was marvelling at the coolness
and pluck with which she was carrying off the situation

I know beforehand that you will censure me she replied helping
Blanche arrange the wet gear over the fire  I was at Mrs Stantons
but first you must know Miss Mortimer and I are staying at the
Pentlys for a week  Now to start fresh again  I intended to leave
Mrs Stantons before dark but her baby got into the kerosene her
husband had gone down to Dawson andwell we werent sure of the baby
up to half an hour ago  She wouldnt hear of me returning alone but
there was nothing to fear only I had not expected soft ice in such a
snap

Howd you fix the kid Del asked intent on keeping the talk going
now that it had started

Chewing tobacco  And when the laughter had subsided she went on
There wasnt any mustard and it was the best I could think of
Besides Matt McCarthy saved my life with it once down at Dyea when I
had the croup  But you were singing when I came in she suggested
Do go on

Jake Cornell hawed prodigiously   And I got done

Then you Del  Sing Flying Cloud as you used to coming down the
river

Oh e as said the Virgin

Then you sing  I am sure you do

She smiled into the Virgins eyes and that lady delivered herself of a
coster ballad with more art than she was aware  The chill of Fronas
advent was quickly dissipated and song and toast and merriment went
round again  Nor was Frona above touching lips to the jelly glass in
fellowship and she contributed her quota by singing Annie Laurie and
Ben Bolt  Also but privily she watched the drink saturating the
besotted souls of Cornell and the Virgin  It was an experience and
she was glad of it though sorry in a way for Corliss who played the
host lamely

But he had little need of pity  Any other woman he said to
himself a score of times looking at Frona and trying to picture
numerous women he had known by his mothers teapot knocking at the
door and coming in as Frona had done  Then again it was only
yesterday that it would have hurt him Blanches rubbing her feet but
now he gloried in Fronas permitting it and his heart went out in a
more kindly way to Blanche  Perhaps it was the elevation of the
liquor but he seemed to discover new virtues in her rugged face

Frona had put on her dried moccasins and risen to her feet and was
listening patiently to Jake Cornell who hiccoughed a last incoherent
toast

To thehicman he rumbled cavernously the manhicthat
madethat made

The blessed country volunteered the Virgin

True my dearhic  To the man that made the blessed country
Tohicto Jacob Welse

And a rider Blanche cried  To Jacob Welses daughter

Ay  Standing  And bottoms up

Oh shes a jolly good fellow Del led off the drink ruddying his
cheek

Id like to shake hands with you just once Blanche said in a low
voice while the rest were chorusing

Frona slipped her mitten which she had already put on and the
pressure was firm between them

No she said to Corliss who had put on his cap and was tying the
earflaps Blanche tells me the Pentlys are only half a mile from
here  The trail is straight  Ill not hear of any one accompanying me

No  This time she spoke so authoritatively that he tossed his cap
into the bunk  Goodnight all she called sweeping the roisterers
with a smile

But Corliss saw her to the door and stepped outside  She glanced up to
him  Her hood was pulled only partly up and her face shone alluringly
under the starlight

IFrona     I wish

Dont be alarmed she whispered  Ill not tell on you Vance

He saw the mocking glint in her eyes but tried to go on  I wish to
explain just how

No need  I understand  But at the same time I must confess I do not
particularly admire your taste

Frona The evident pain in his voice reached her

Oh you big foolish she laughed  Dont I know  Didnt Blanche
tell me she wet her feet

Corliss bowed his head  Truly Frona you are the most consistent
woman I ever met  Furthermore with a straightening of his form and a
dominant assertion in his voice this is not the last

She tried to stop him but he continued  I feel I know that things
will turn out differently  To fling your own words back at you all
the factors have not been taken into consideration  As for St Vincent
   Ill have you yet  For that matter now could not be too soon

He flashed out hungry arms to her but she read quicker than he moved
and laughing eluded him and ran lightly down the trail

Come back Frona  Come back he called I am sorry

No youre not came the answer  And Id be sorry if you were
Goodnight

He watched her merge into the shadows then entered the cabin  He had
utterly forgotten the scene within and at the first glance it startled
him  Cariboo Blanche was crying softly to herself  Her eyes were
luminous and moist and as he looked a lone tear stole down her
cheek  Bishops face had gone serious  The Virgin had sprawled head
and shoulders on the table amid overturned mugs and dripping lees and
Cornell was tittubating over her hiccoughing and repeating vacuously
Youre all right my dear  Youre all right

But the Virgin was inconsolable  O Gawd  Wen I think on wot is an
was     an no fault of mine  No fault of mine I tell you she
shrieked with quick fierceness  Ow was I born I ask  Wot was my
old man  A drunk a chronic  An my old woman  Talk of Whitechapel
Oo guv a cent for me or ow I was dragged up  Oo cared a rap I
say  Oo cared a rap

A sudden revulsion came over Corliss  Hold your tongue he ordered

The Virgin raised her head her loosened hair streaming about her like
a Furys  Wot is she she sneered  Sweeteart

Corliss whirled upon her savagely face white and voice shaking with
passion

The Virgin cowered down and instinctively threw up her hands to protect
her face  Dont it me sir she whined  Dont it me

He was frightened at himself and waited till he could gather control
Now he said calmly get into your things and go  All of you
Clear out  Vamose

Youre no man you aint the Virgin snarled discovering that
physical assault was not imminent

But Corliss herded her particularly to the door and gave no heed

Aturning ladies out she sniffed with a stumble over the threshold

No offence Jake Cornell muttered pacifically no offence

Goodnight  Sorry Corliss said to Blanche with the shadow of a
forgiving smile as she passed out


Youre a toff  Thats wot you are a bloomin toff the Virgin
howled back as he shut the door

He looked blankly at Del Bishop and surveyed the sodden confusion on
the table  Then he walked over and threw himself down on his bunk
Bishop leaned an elbow on the table and pulled at his wheezy pipe  The
lamp smoked flickered and went out but still he remained filling
his pipe again and again and striking endless matches

Del  Are you awake Corliss called at last

Del grunted

I was a cur to turn them out into the snow  I am ashamed

Sure was the affirmation

A long silence followed  Del knocked the ashes out and raised up

Sleep he called

There was no reply and he walked to the bunk softly and pulled the
blankets over the engineer




CHAPTER XXI

Yes what does it all mean  Corliss stretched lazily and cocked up
his feet on the table  He was not especially interested but Colonel
Trethaway persisted in talking seriously

Thats it  The very thingthe old and ever young demand which man
slaps into the face of the universe  The colonel searched among the
scraps in his notebook  See holding up a soiled slip of typed
paper I copied this out years ago  Listen  What a monstrous
spectre is this man this disease of the agglutinated dust lifting
alternate feet or lying drugged with slumber killing feeding
growing bringing forth small copies of himself grown up with hair
like grass fitted with eyes that glitter in his face a thing to set
children screaming  Poor soul here for so little cast among so many
hardships filled with desires so incommensurate and so inconsistent
savagely surrounded savagely descended irremediably condemned to prey
upon his fellowlives  Infinitely childish often admirably valiant
often touchingly kind sitting down to debate of right or wrong and the
attributes of the deity rising up to battle for an egg or die for an
idea

And all to what end he demanded hotly throwing down the paper
this disease of the agglutinated dust

Corliss yawned in reply  He had been on trail all day and was yearning
for betweenblankets

Here am I Colonel Trethaway modestly along in years fairly well
preserved a place in the community a comfortable bank account no
need to ever exert myself again yet enduring life bleakly and working
ridiculously with a zest worthy of a man half my years  And to what
end  I can only eat so much smoke so much sleep so much and this
taildump of earth men call Alaska is the worst of all possible places
in the matter of grub tobacco and blankets

But it is the living strenuously which holds you Corliss interjected

Fronas philosophy the colonel sneered

And my philosophy and yours

And of the agglutinated dust

Which is quickened with a passion you do not take into accountthe
passion of duty of race of God

And the compensation Trethaway demanded

Each breath you draw  The Mayfly lives an hour

I dont see it

Blood and sweat  Blood and sweat  You cried that after the rough and
tumble in the Opera House and every word of it was receipt in full

Fronas philosophy

And yours and mine

The colonel threw up his shoulders and after a pause confessed  You
see try as I will I cant make a pessimist out of myself  We are all
compensated and I more fully than most men  What end I asked and
the answer forthcame Since the ultimate end is beyond us then the
immediate  More compensation here and now

Quite hedonistic

And rational  I shall look to it at once  I can buy grub and
blankets for a score I can eat and sleep for only one ergo why not
for two

Corliss took his feet down and sat up  In other words

I shall get married andgive the community a shock  Communities
like shocks  Thats one of their compensations for being
agglutinative

I cant think of but one woman Corliss essayed tentatively putting
out his hand

Trethaway shook it slowly  It is she

Corliss let go and misgiving shot into his face  But St Vincent

Is your problem not mine

Then Lucile

Certainly not  She played a quixotic little game of her own and
botched it beautifully

II do not understand  Corliss brushed his brows in a dazed sort of
way

Trethaway parted his lips in a superior smile  It is not necessary
that you should  The question is Will you stand up with me

Surely  But what a confoundedly long way around you took  It is not
your usual method

Nor was it with her the colonel declared twisting his moustache
proudly


A captain of the NorthWest Mounted Police by virtue of his
magisterial office may perform marriages in time of stress as well as
execute exemplary justice  So Captain Alexander received a call from
Colonel Trethaway and after he left jotted down an engagement for the
next morning  Then the impending groom went to see Frona  Lucile did
not make the request he hastened to explain butwell the fact was
she did not know any women and furthermore he the colonel knew
whom Lucile would like to ask did she dare  So he did it upon his own
responsibility  And coming as a surprise he knew it would be a great
joy to her

Frona was taken aback by the suddenness of it  Only the other day it
was that Lucile had made a plea to her for St Vincent and now it was
Colonel Trethaway  True there had been a false quantity somewhere
but now it seemed doubly false  Could it be after all that Lucile
was mercenary  These thoughts crowded upon her swiftly with the
colonel anxiously watching her face the while  She knew she must
answer quickly yet was distracted by an involuntary admiration for his
bravery  So she followed perforce the lead of her heart and
consented

Yet the whole thing was rather strained when the four of them came
together next day in Captain Alexanders private office  There was a
gloomy chill about it  Lucile seemed ready to cry and showed a
repressed perturbation quite unexpected of her while try as she
would Frona could not call upon her usual sympathy to drive away the
coldness which obtruded intangibly between them  This in turn had a
consequent effect on Vance and gave a certain distance to his manner
which forced him out of touch even with the colonel

Colonel Trethaway seemed to have thrown twenty years off his erect
shoulders and the discrepancy in the match which Frona had felt
vanished as she looked at him  He has lived the years well she
thought and prompted mysteriously almost with vague apprehension she
turned her eyes to Corliss  But if the groom had thrown off twenty
years Vance was not a whit behind  Since their last meeting he had
sacrificed his brown moustache to the frost and his smooth face
smitten with health and vigor looked uncommonly boyish and yet
withal the naked upper lip advertised a stiffness and resolution
hitherto concealed  Furthermore his features portrayed a growth and
his eyes which had been softly firm were now firm with the added
harshness or hardness which is bred of coping with things and coping
quicklythe stamp of executiveness which is pressed upon men who do
and upon all men who do whether they drive dogs buck the sea or
dictate the policies of empires

When the simple ceremony was over Frona kissed Lucile but Lucile felt
that there was a subtle something wanting and her eyes filled with
unshed tears  Trethaway who had felt the aloofness from the start
caught an opportunity with Frona while Captain Alexander and Corliss
were being pleasant to Mrs Trethaway

Whats the matter Frona the colonel demanded bluntly  I hope you
did not come under protest  I am sorry not for you because lack of
frankness deserves nothing but for Lucile  It is not fair to her

There has been a lack of frankness throughout  Her voice trembled
I tried my bestI thought I could do betterbut I cannot feign
what I do not feel  I am sorry but I    I am disappointed  No I
cannot explain and to you least of all

Lets be aboveboard Frona  St Vincents concerned

She nodded

And I can put my hand right on the spot  First place he looked to
the side and saw Lucile stealing an anxious glance to himfirst
place only the other day she gave you a song about St Vincent
Second place and therefore you think her hearts not in this present
proposition that she doesnt care a rap for me in short that shes
marrying me for reinstatement and spoils  Isnt that it

And isnt it enough  Oh I am disappointed Colonel Trethaway
grievously in her in you in myself

Dont be a fool  I like you too well to see you make yourself one
The plays been too quick that is all  Your eye lost it  Listen
Weve kept it quiet but shes in with the elect on French Hill  Her
claims prospected the richest of the outfit  Present indication half
a million at least  In her own name no strings attached  Couldnt
she take that and go anywhere in the world and reinstate herself  And
for that matter you might presume that I am marrying her for spoils
Frona she cares for me and in your ear shes too good for me  My
hope is that the future will make up  But never mind thathavent got
the time now

You consider her affection sudden eh  Let me tell you weve been
growing into each other from the time I came into the country and with
our eyes open  St Vincent  Pshaw  I knew it all the time  She got
it into her head that the whole of him wasnt worth a little finger of
you and she tried to break things up  Youll never know how she
worked with him  I told her she didnt know the Welse and she said
so too after  So there it is take it or leave it

But what do you think about St Vincent

What I think is neither here nor there but Ill tell you honestly
that I back her judgment  But thats not the point  What are you
going to do about it about her now

She did not answer but went back to the waiting group  Lucile saw her
coming and watched her face

Hes been telling you

That I am a fool Frona answered  And I think I am  And with a
smile I take it on faith that I am anyway  II cant reason it out
just now but  

Captain Alexander discovered a prenuptial joke just about then and led
the way over to the stove to crack it upon the colonel and Vance went
along to see fair play

Its the first time Lucile was saying and it means more to me so
much more than to    most women  I am afraid  It is a terrible
thing for me to do  But I do love him I do  And when the joke had
been duly digested and they came back she was sobbing Dear dear
Frona

It was just the moment better than he could have chosen and capped
and mittened without knocking Jacob Welse came in

The uninvited guest was his greeting  Is it all over  So  And
he swallowed Lucile up in his huge bearskin  Colonel your hand and
your pardon for my intruding and your regrets for not giving me the
word  Come out with them  Hello Corliss  Captain Alexander a good
day

What have I done Frona wailed received the bearhug and managed to
press his hand till it almost hurt

Had to back the game he whispered and this time his hand did hurt

Now colonel I dont know what your plans are and I dont care
Call them off  Ive got a little spread down to the house and the
only honest case of champagne this side of Circle  Of course youre
coming Corliss and  His eye roved past Captain Alexander with
hardly a pause

Of course came the answer like a flash though the Chief Magistrate
of the Northwest had had time to canvass the possible results of such
unofficial action  Got a hack

Jacob Welse laughed and held up a moccasined foot  Walking
bechucked  The captain started impulsively towards the door  Ill
have the sleds up before youre ready  Three of them and bells
galore

So Trethaways forecast was correct and Dawson vindicated its
agglutinativeness by rubbing its eyes when three sleds with three
scarlettuniced policemen swinging the whips tore down its main
street and it rubbed its eyes again when it saw the occupants thereof


We shall live quietly Lucile told Frona  The Klondike is not all
the world and the best is yet to come

But Jacob Welse said otherwise  Weve got to make this thing go he
said to Captain Alexander and Captain Alexander said that he was
unaccustomed to backing out

Mrs Schoville emitted preliminary thunders marshalled the other
women and became chronically seismic and unsafe

Lucile went nowhere save to Fronas  But Jacob Welse who rarely went
anywhere was often to be found by Colonel Trethaways fireside and
not only was he to be found there but he usually brought somebody
along  Anything on hand this evening he was wont to say on casual
meeting  No  Then come along with me  Sometimes he said it with
lamblike innocence sometimes with a challenge brooding under his
bushy brows and rarely did he fail to get his man  These men had
wives and thus were the germs of dissolution sown in the ranks of the
opposition

Then again at Colonel Trethaways there was something to be found
besides weak tea and small talk and the correspondents engineers and
gentlemen rovers kept the trail well packed in that direction though
it was the Kings to a man who first broke the way  So the Trethaway
cabin became the centre of things and backed commercially
financially and officially it could not fail to succeed socially

The only bad effect of all this was to make the lives of Mrs Schoville
and divers others of her sex more monotonous and to cause them to lose
faith in certain hoary and inconsequent maxims  Furthermore Captain
Alexander as highest official was a power in the land and Jacob
Welse was the Company and there was a superstition extant concerning
the unwisdom of being on indifferent terms with the Company  And the
time was not long till probably a bare halfdozen remained in outer
cold and they were considered a warped lot anyway




CHAPTER XXII

Quite an exodus took place in Dawson in the spring  Men because they
had made stakes and other men because they had made none bought up
the available dogs and rushed out for Dyea over the last ice
Incidentally it was discovered that Dave Harney possessed most of
these dogs

Going out Jacob Welse asked him on a day when the meridian sun for
the first time felt faintly warm to the naked skin

Well I calkilate not  Im clearin three dollars a pair on the
moccasins I cornered to say nothing but saw wood on the boots  Say
Welse not that my nose is out of joint but you jest cinched me
everlastin on sugar didnt you

Jacob Welse smiled

And by the Jimcracky Im squared  Got any rubber boots

No went out of stock early in the winter  Dave snickered slowly
And Im the pertickler party that hocuspocused em

Not you  I gave special orders to the clerks  They werent sold in
lots

No more they want  One man to the pair and one pair to the man and
a couple of hundred of them but it was my dust they chucked into the
scales an nobody elses  Drink  Dont mind  Easy  Put up your sack
Call it rebate for I kin afford it    Goin out  Not this year I
guess  Washups comin

A strike on Henderson the middle of April which promised to be
sensational drew St Vincent to Stewart River  And a little later
Jacob Welse interested on Gallagher Gulch and with an eye riveted on
the copper mines of White River went up into the same district and
with him went Frona for it was more vacation than business  In the
mean time Corliss and Bishop who had been on trail for a month or
more running over the Mayo and McQuestion Country rounded up on the
left fork of Henderson where a block of claims waited to be surveyed

But by May spring was so far advanced that travel on the creeks became
perilous and on the last of the thawing ice the miners travelled down
to the bunch of islands below the mouth of the Stewart where they went
into temporary quarters or crowded the hospitality of those who
possessed cabins  Corliss and Bishop located on Splitup Island so
called through the habit parties from the Outside had of dividing there
and going several ways where Tommy McPherson was comfortably
situated  A couple of days later Jacob Welse and Frona arrived from a
hazardous trip out of White River and pitched tent on the high ground
at the upper end of Splitup  A few chechaquos the first of the
spring rush strung in exhausted and went into camp against the
breaking of the river  Also there were still men going out who
barred by the rotten ice came ashore to build polingboats and await
the breakup or to negotiate with the residents for canoes  Notably
among these was the Baron Courbertin

Ah  Excruciating  Magnificent  Is it not

So Frona first ran across him on the following day  What she asked
giving him her hand

You  You doffing his cap  It is a delight

I am sure she began

No  No  He shook his curly mop warmly  It is not you  See  He
turned to a Peterborough for which McPherson had just mulcted him of
thrice its value  The canoe  Is it notnotwhat you Yankees
calla bute

Oh the canoe she repeated with a falling inflection of chagrin

No  No  Pardon  He stamped angrily upon the ground  It is not
so  It is not you  It is not the canoe  It isah  I have it now
It is your promise  One day do you not remember at Madame
Schovilles we talked of the canoe and of my ignorance which was
sad and you promised you said

I would give you your first lesson

And is it not delightful  Listen  Do you not hear  The
ripplingah the ripplingdeep down at the heart of things  Soon
will the water run free  Here is the canoe  Here we meet  The first
lesson  Delightful  Delightful

The next island below Splitup was known as Roubeaus Island and was
separated from the former by a narrow backchannel  Here when the
bottom had about dropped out of the trail and with the dogs swimming
as often as not arrived St Vincentthe last man to travel the winter
trail  He went into the cabin of John Borg a taciturn gloomy
individual prone to segregate himself from his kind  It was the
mischance of St Vincents life that of all cabins he chose Borgs for
an abidingplace against the breakup

All right the man said when questioned by him  Throw your
blankets into the corner  Bellall clear the litter out of the spare
bunk

Not till evening did he speak again and then Youre big enough to do
your own cooking  When the womans done with the stove you can fire
away

The woman or Bella was a comely Indian girl young and the prettiest
St Vincent had run across  Instead of the customary greased
swarthiness of the race her skin was clear and of a lightbronze tone
and her features less harsh more felicitously curved than those
common to the blood

After supper Borg both elbows on table and huge misshapen hands
supporting chin and jaws sat puffing stinking Siwash tobacco and
staring straight before him  It would have seemed ruminative the
stare had his eyes been softer or had he blinked as it was his face
was set and trancelike

Have you been in the country long St Vincent asked endeavoring to
make conversation

Borg turned his sullenblack eyes upon him and seemed to look into him
and through him and beyond him and still regarding him to have
forgotten all about him  It was as though he pondered some great and
weighty matterprobably his sins the correspondent mused nervously
rolling himself a cigarette  When the yellow cube had dissipated
itself in curling fragrance and he was deliberating about rolling a
second Borg suddenly spoke

Fifteen years he said and returned to his tremendous cogitation

Thereat and for half an hour thereafter St Vincent fascinated
studied his inscrutable countenance  To begin with it was a massive
head abnormal and topheavy and its only excuse for being was the
huge bullthroat which supported it  It had been cast in a mould of
elemental generousness and everything about it partook of the
asymmetrical crudeness of the elemental  The hair rank of growth
thick and unkempt matted itself here and there into curious splotches
of gray and again grinning at age twisted itself into curling locks
of lustreless blacklocks of unusual thickness like crooked fingers
heavy and solid  The shaggy whiskers almost bare in places and in
others massing into bunchgrasslike clumps were plentifully splashed
with gray  They rioted monstrously over his face and fell raggedly to
his chest but failed to hide the great hollowed cheeks or the twisted
mouth  The latter was thinlipped and cruel but cruel only in a
passionless sort of way  But the forehead was the anomalythe
anomaly required to complete the irregularity of the face  For it was
a perfect forehead full and broad and rising superbly strong to its
high dome  It was as the seat and bulwark of some vast intelligence
omniscience might have brooded there

Bella washing the dishes and placing them away on the shelf behind
Borgs back dropped a heavy tin cup  The cabin was very still and
the sharp rattle came without warning  On the instant with a brute
roar the chair was overturned and Borg was on his feet eyes blazing
and face convulsed  Bella gave an inarticulate animallike cry of
fear and cowered at his feet  St Vincent felt his hair bristling and
an uncanny chill like a jet of cold air played up and down his spine
Then Borg righted the chair and sank back into his old position chin
on hands and brooding ponderously  Not a word was spoken and Bella
went on unconcernedly with the dishes while St Vincent rolled a
shaky cigarette and wondered if it had been a dream

Jacob Welse laughed when the correspondent told him  Just his way
he said for his ways are like his looksunusual  Hes an
unsociable beast  Been in the country more years than he can number
acquaintances  Truth to say I dont think he has a friend in all
Alaska not even among the Indians and hes chummed thick with them
off and on  Johnny Sorehead they call him but it might as well be
Johnny Breakumhead for hes got a quick temper and a rough hand
Temper  Some little misunderstanding popped up between him and the
agent at Arctic City  He was in the right tooagents mistakebut
he tabooed the Company on the spot and lived on straight meat for a
year  Then I happened to run across him at Tanana Station and after
due explanations he consented to buy from us again

Got the girl from up the headwaters of the White Bill Brown told
St Vincent  Welse thinks hes pioneering in that direction but Borg
could give him cards and spades on it and then win out  Hes been over
the ground years ago  Yes strange sort of a chap  Wouldnt hanker to
be bunkmates with him

But St Vincent did not mind the eccentricities of the man for he
spent most of his time on Splitup Island with Frona and the Baron
One day however and innocently he ran foul of him  Two Swedes
hunting treesquirrels from the other end of Roubeau Island had
stopped to ask for matches and to yarn a while in the warm sunshine of
the clearing  St Vincent and Borg were accommodating them the latter
for the most part in meditative monosyllables  Just to the rear by
the cabindoor Bella was washing clothes  The tub was a cumbersome
homemade affair and halffull of water was more than a fair match
for an ordinary woman  The correspondent noticed her struggling with
it and stepped back quickly to her aid

With the tub between them they proceeded to carry it to one side in
order to dump it where the ground drained from the cabin  St Vincent
slipped in the thawing snow and the soapy water splashed up  Then
Bella slipped and then they both slipped  Bella giggled and laughed
and St Vincent laughed back  The spring was in the air and in their
blood and it was very good to be alive  Only a wintry heart could
deny a smile on such a day  Bella slipped again tried to recover
slipped with the other foot and sat down abruptly  Laughing
gleefully both of them the correspondent caught her hands to pull her
to her feet  With a bound and a bellow Borg was upon them  Their
hands were torn apart and St Vincent thrust heavily backward  He
staggered for a couple of yards and almost fell  Then the scene of the
cabin was repeated  Bella cowered and grovelled in the muck and her
lord towered wrathfully over her

Look you he said in stifled gutturals turning to St Vincent  You
sleep in my cabin and you cook  That is enough  Let my woman alone

Things went on after that as though nothing had happened St Vincent
gave Bella a wide berth and seemed to have forgotten her existence
But the Swedes went back to their end of the island laughing at the
trivial happening which was destined to be significant




CHAPTER XXIII

Spring smiting with soft warm hands had come like a miracle and now
lingered for a dreamy spell before bursting into fullblown summer
The snow had left the bottoms and valleys and nestled only on the north
slopes of the icescarred ridges  The glacial drip was already in
evidence and every creek in roaring spate  Each day the sun rose
earlier and stayed later  It was now chill day by three oclock and
mellow twilight at nine  Soon a golden circle would be drawn around
the sky and deep midnight become bright as high noon  The willows and
aspens had long since budded and were now decking themselves in
liveries of fresh young green and the sap was rising in the pines

Mother nature had heaved her waking sigh and gone about her brief
business  Crickets sang of nights in the stilly cabins and in the
sunshine mosquitoes crept from out hollow logs and snug crevices among
the rocksbig noisy harmless fellows that had procreated the year
gone lain frozen through the winter and were now rejuvenated to buzz
through swift senility to second death  All sorts of creeping
crawling fluttering life came forth from the warming earth and
hastened to mature reproduce and cease  Just a breath of balmy air
and then the long cold frost againah they knew it well and lost no
time  Sand martins were driving their ancient tunnels into the soft
clay banks and robins singing on the sprucegarbed islands  Overhead
the woodpecker knocked insistently and in the forest depths the
partridge boomboomed and strutted in virile glory

But in all this nervous haste the Yukon took no part  For many a
thousand miles it lay cold unsmiling dead  Wild fowl driving up
from the south in windjamming wedges halted looked vainly for open
water and quested dauntlessly on into the north  From bank to bank
stretched the savage ice  Here and there the water burst through and
flooded over but in the chill nights froze solidly as ever  Tradition
has it that of old time the Yukon lay unbroken through three long
summers and on the face of it there be traditions less easy of belief

So summer waited for open water and the tardy Yukon took to stretching
of days and cracking its stiff joints  Now an airhole ate into the
ice and ate and ate or a fissure formed and grew and failed to
freeze again  Then the ice ripped from the shore and uprose bodily a
yard  But still the river was loth to loose its grip  It was a slow
travail and man used to nursing nature with pigmy skill able to
burst waterspouts and harness waterfalls could avail nothing against
the billions of frigid tons which refused to run down the hill to
Bering Sea

On Splitup Island all were ready for the breakup  Waterways have
ever been first highways and the Yukon was the sole highway in all the
land  So those bound upriver pitched their polingboats and shod
their poles with iron and those bound down caulked their scows and
barges and shaped spare sweeps with axe and drawingknife  Jacob Welse
loafed and joyed in the utter cessation from work and Frona joyed with
him in that it was good  But Baron Courbertin was in a fever at the
delay  His hot blood grew riotous after the long hibernation and the
warm sunshine dazzled him with warmer fancies

Oh  Oh  It will never break  Never  And he stood gazing at the
surly ice and raining politely phrased anathema upon it  It is a
conspiracy poor La Bijou a conspiracy  He caressed La Bijou like it
were a horse for so he had christened the glistening Peterborough
canoe

Frona and St Vincent laughed and preached him the gospel of patience
which he proceeded to tuck away into the deepest abysses of perdition
till interrupted by Jacob Welse

Look Courbertin  Over there south of the bluff  Do you make out
anything  Moving

Yes a dog

It moves too slowly for a dog  Frona get the glasses

Courbertin and St Vincent sprang after them but the latter knew their
abidingplace and returned triumphant  Jacob Welse put the binoculars
to his eyes and gazed steadily across the river  It was a sheer mile
from the island to the farther bank and the sunglare on the ice was a
sore task to the vision

It is a man  He passed the glasses to the Baron and strained
absently with his naked eyes  And something is up

He creeps the baron exclaimed  The man creeps he crawls on hand
and knee  Look  See  He thrust the glasses tremblingly into Fronas
hands

Looking across the void of shimmering white it was difficult to
discern a dark object of such size when dimly outlined against an
equally dark background of brush and earth  But Frona could make the
man out with fair distinctness and as she grew accustomed to the
strain she could distinguish each movement and especially so when he
came to a windthrown pine  Sue watched painfully  Twice after
tortuous effort squirming and twisting he failed in breasting the big
trunk and on the third attempt after infinite exertion he cleared it
only to topple helplessly forward and fall on his face in the tangled
undergrowth

It is a man  She turned the glasses over to St Vincent  And he is
crawling feebly  He fell just then this side of the log

Does he move Jacob Welse asked and on a shake of St Vincents
head brought his rifle from the tent

He fired six shots skyward in rapid succession  He moves  The
correspondent followed him closely  He is crawling to the bank  Ah
    No one moment    Yes  He lies on the ground and raises his
hat or something on a stick  He is waving it Jacob Welse fired
six more shots  He waves again  Now he has dropped it and lies
quite still

All three looked inquiringly to Jacob Welse

He shrugged his shoulders  How should I know  A white man or an
Indian starvation most likely or else he is injured

But he may be dying Frona pleaded as though her father who had
done most things could do all things

We can do nothing

Ah  Terrible terrible  The baron wrung his hands  Before our
very eyes and we can do nothing  No he exclaimed with swift
resolution it shall not be  I will cross the ice

He would have started precipitately down the bank had not Jacob Welse
caught his arm

Not such a rush baron  Keep your head

But

But nothing  Does the man want food or medicine or what  Wait a
moment  We will try it together

Count me in St Vincent volunteered promptly and Fronas eyes
sparkled

While she made up a bundle of food in the tent the men provided and
rigged themselves with sixty or seventy feet of light rope  Jacob
Welse and St Vincent made themselves fast to it at either end and the
baron in the middle  He claimed the food as his portion and strapped
it to his broad shoulders  Frona watched their progress from the bank
The first hundred yards were easy going but she noticed at once the
change when they had passed the limit of the fairly solid shoreice
Her father led sturdily feeling ahead and to the side with his staff
and changing direction continually

St Vincent at the rear of the extended line was the first to go
through but he fell with the pole thrust deftly across the opening and
resting on the ice  His head did not go under though the current
sucked powerfully and the two men dragged him out after a sharp pull
Frona saw them consult together for a minute with much pointing and
gesticulating on the part of the baron and then St Vincent detach
himself and turn shoreward

Brrrr he shivered coming up the bank to her  Its impossible

But why didnt they come in she asked a slight note of displeasure
manifest in her voice

Said they were going to make one more try first  That Courbertin is
hotheaded you know

And my father just as bullheaded she smiled  But hadnt you
better change  There are spare things in the tent

Oh no  He threw himself down beside her  Its warm in the sun

For an hour they watched the two men who had become mere specks of
black in the distance for they had managed to gain the middle of the
river and at the same time had worked nearly a mile upstream  Frona
followed them closely with the glasses though often they were lost to
sight behind the iceridges

It was unfair of them she heard St Vincent complain to say they
were only going to have one more try  Otherwise I should not have
turned back  Yet they cant make itabsolutely impossible

Yes     No     Yes  Theyre turning back she announced  But
listen  What is that

A hoarse rumble like distant thunder rose from the midst of the ice
She sprang to her feet  Gregory the river cant be breaking

No no surely not  See it is gone  The noise which had come from
above had died away downstream

But there  There

Another rumble hoarser and more ominous than before lifted itself and
hushed the robins and the squirrels  When abreast of them it sounded
like a railroad train on a distant trestle  A third rumble which
approached a roar and was of greater duration began from above and
passed by

Oh why dont they hurry

The two specks had stopped evidently in conversation  She ran the
glasses hastily up and down the river  Though another roar had risen
she could make out no commotion  The ice lay still and motionless
The robins resumed their singing and the squirrels were chattering
with spiteful glee

Dont fear Frona  St Vincent put his arm about her protectingly
If there is any danger they know it better than we and they are
taking their time

I never saw a big river break up she confessed and resigned herself
to the waiting

The roars rose and fell sporadically but there were no other signs of
disruption and gradually the two men with frequent duckings worked
inshore  The water was streaming from them and they were shivering
severely as they came up the bank

At last Frona had both her fathers hands in hers  I thought you
would never come back

There there  Run and get dinner Jacob Welse laughed  There was
no danger

But what was it

Stewart Rivers broken and sending its ice down under the Yukon ice
We could hear the grinding plainly out there

Ah  And it was terrible terrible cried the baron  And that poor
poor man we cannot save him

Yes we can  Well have a try with the dogs after dinner  Hurry
Frona

But the dogs were a failure  Jacob Welse picked out the leaders as the
more intelligent and with grubpacks on them drove them out from the
bank  They could not grasp what was demanded of them  Whenever they
tried to return they were driven back with sticks and clods and
imprecations  This only bewildered them and they retreated out of
range whence they raised their wet cold paws and whined pitifully to
the shore

If they could only make it once they would understand and then it
would go like clockwork  Ah  Would you  Go on  Chook Miriam
Chook  The thing is to get the first one across

Jacob Welse finally succeeded in getting Miriam leaddog to Fronas
team to take the trail left by him and the baron  The dog went on
bravely scrambling over floundering through and sometimes swimming
but when she had gained the farthest point reached by them she sat
down helplessly  Later on she cut back to the shore at a tangent
landing on the deserted island above and an hour afterwards trotted
into camp minus the grubpack  Then the two dogs hovering just out of
range compromised matters by devouring each others burdens after
which the attempt was given over and they were called in

During the afternoon the noise increased in frequency and by nightfall
was continuous but by morning it had ceased utterly  The river had
risen eight feet and in many places was running over its crust  Much
crackling and splitting were going on and fissures leaping into life
and multiplying in all directions

The undertow ice has jammed below among the islands Jacob Welse
explained  Thats what caused the rise  Then again it has jammed
at the mouth of the Stewart and is backing up  When that breaks
through it will go down underneath and stick on the lower jam

And then and then  The baron exulted

La Bijou will swim again

As the light grew stronger they searched for the man across the river
He had not moved but in response to their rifleshots waved feebly

Nothing for it till the river breaks baron and then a dash with La
Bijou  St Vincent you had better bring your blankets up and sleep
here tonight  Well need three paddles and I think we can get
McPherson

No need the correspondent hastened to reply  The backchannel is
like adamant and Ill be up by daybreak

But I  Why not  Baron Courbertin demanded  Frona laughed
Remember we havent given you your first lessons yet

And therell hardly be time tomorrow Jacob Welse added  When she
goes she goes with a rush  St Vincent McPherson and I will have to
make the crew Im afraid  Sorry baron  Stay with us another year
and youll be fit

But Baron Courbertin was inconsolable and sulked for a full halfhour




CHAPTER XXIV

Awake  You dreamers wake

Frona was out of her sleepingfurs at Del Bishops first call but ere
she had slipped a skirt on and bare feet into moccasins her father
beyond the blanketcurtain had thrown back the flaps of the tent and
stumbled out

The river was up  In the chill gray light she could see the ice
rubbing softly against the very crest of the bank it even topped it in
places and the huge cakes worked inshore many feet  A hundred yards
out the white field merged into the dim dawn and the gray sky  Subdued
splits and splutters whispered from out the obscureness and a gentle
grinding could be heard

When will it go she asked of Del

Not a bit too lively for us  See there  He pointed with his toe to
the water lapping out from under the ice and creeping greedily towards
them  A foot rise every ten minutes

Danger he scoffed  Not on your life  Its got to go  Them
islandswaving his hand indefinitely down rivercant hold up under
more pressure  If they dont let go the ice the icell scour them
clean out of the bed of the Yukon  Sure  But Ive got to be chasin
back  Lower ground down our way  Fifteen inches on the cabin floor
and McPherson and Corliss hustlin perishables into the bunks

Tell McPherson to be ready for a call Jacob Welse shouted after him
And then to Frona Nows the time for St Vincent to cross the
backchannel

The baron shivering barefooted pulled out his watch  Ten minutes to
three he chattered

Hadnt you better go back and get your moccasins Frona asked
There will be time

And miss the magnificence  Hark

From nowhere in particular a brisk crackling arose then died away
The ice was in motion  Slowly very slowly it proceeded down stream
There was no commotion no earsplitting thunder no splendid display
of force simply a silent flood of white an orderly procession of
tightpacked icepacked so closely that not a drop of water was in
evidence  It was there somewhere down underneath but it had to be
taken on faith  There was a dull hum or muffled grating but so low in
pitch that the ear strained to catch it

Ah  Where is the magnificence  It is a fake

The baron shook his fists angrily at the river and Jacob Welses thick
brows seemed to draw down in order to hide the grim smile in his eyes

Ha ha  I laugh  I snap my fingers  See  I defy

As the challenge left his lips  Baron Courbertin stepped upon a cake
which rubbed lightly past at his feet  So unexpected was it that when
Jacob Welse reached after him he was gone

The ice was picking up in momentum and the hum growing louder and more
threatening  Balancing gracefully like a circusrider the Frenchman
whirled away along the rim of the bank  Fifty precarious feet he rode
his mount becoming more unstable every instant and he leaped neatly to
the shore  He came back laughing and received for his pains two or
three of the choicest phrases Jacob Welse could select from the
essentially masculine portion of his vocabulary

And for why Courbertin demanded stung to the quick

For why Jacob Welse mimicked wrathfully pointing into the sleek
stream sliding by

A great cake had driven its nose into the bed of the river thirty feet
below and was struggling to upend  All the frigid flood behind
crinkled and bent back like so much paper  Then the stalled cake
turned completely over and thrust its muddy nose skyward  But the
squeeze caught it while cake mounted cake at its back and its fifty
feet of muck and gouge were hurled into the air  It crashed upon the
moving mass beneath and flying fragments landed at the feet of those
that watched  Caught broadside in a chaos of pressures it crumbled
into scattered pieces and disappeared

God  The baron spoke the word reverently and with awe

Frona caught his hand on the one side and her fathers on the other
The ice was now leaping past in feverish haste  Somewhere below a
heavy cake butted into the bank and the ground swayed under their
feet  Another followed it nearer the surface and as they sprang
back upreared mightily and with a ton or so of soil on its broad
back bowled insolently onward  And yet another reaching inshore like
a huge hand ripped three careless pines out by the roots and bore them
away

Day had broken and the driving white gorged the Yukon from shore to
shore  What of the pressure of pent water behind the speed of the
flood had become dizzying  Down all its length the bank was being
gashed and gouged and the island was jarring and shaking to its
foundations

Oh great  Great  Frona sprang up and down between the men  Where
is your fake baron

Ah He shook his head  Ah  I was wrong  I am miserable  But the
magnificence  Look

He pointed down to the bunch of islands which obstructed the bend
There the milewide stream divided and subdivided againwhich was
well for water but not so well for packed ice  The islands drove
their wedged heads into the frozen flood and tossed the cakes high into
the air  But cake pressed upon cake and shelved out of the water out
and up sliding and grinding and climbing and still more cakes from
behind till hillocks and mountains of ice upreared and crashed among
the trees

A likely place for a jam Jacob Welse said  Get the glasses
Frona  He gazed through them long and steadily  Its growing
spreading out  A cake at the right time and the right place   

But the river is falling Frona cried

The ice had dropped six feet below the top of the bank and the Baron
Courbertin marked it with a stick

Our mans still there but he doesnt move

It was clear day and the sun was breaking forth in the northeast
They took turn about with the glasses in gazing across the river

Look  Is it not marvellous  Courbertin pointed to the mark he had
made  The water had dropped another foot  Ah  Too bad too bad
The jam there will be none

Jacob Welse regarded him gravely

Ah  There will be he asked picking up hope

Frona looked inquiringly at her father

Jams are not always nice he said with a short laugh  It all
depends where they take place and where you happen to be

But the river  Look  It falls I can see it before my eyes

It is not too late  He swept the islandstudded bend and saw the
icemountains larger and reaching out one to the other  Go into the
tent Courbertin and put on the pair of moccasins youll find by the
stove  Go on  You wont miss anything  And you Frona start the
fire and get the coffee under way

Half an hour after though the river had fallen twenty feet they found
the ice still pounding along

Now the fun begins  Here take a squint you hotheaded Gaul  The
lefthand channel man  Now she takes it

Courbertin saw the lefthand channel close and then a great white
barrier heave up and travel from island to island  The ice before them
slowed down and came to rest  Then followed the instant rise of the
river  Up it came in a swift rush as though nothing short of the sky
could stop it  As when they were first awakened the cakes rubbed and
slid inshore over the crest of the bank the muddy water creeping in
advance and marking the way

Mon Dieu  But this is not nice

But magnificent baron Frona teased  In the meanwhile you are
getting your feet wet

He retreated out of the water and in time for a small avalanche of
cakes rattled down upon the place he had just left  The rising water
had forced the ice up till it stood breasthigh above the island like a
wall

But it will go down soon when the jam breaks  See even now it comes
up not so swift   It has broken

Frona was watching the barrier  No it hasnt she denied

But the water no longer rises like a racehorse

Nor does it stop rising

He was puzzled for the nonce  Then his face brightened  Ah  I have
it  Above somewhere there is another jam  Most excellent is it
not

She caught his excited hand in hers and detained him  But listen
Suppose the upper jam breaks and the lower jam holds

He looked at her steadily till he grasped the full import  His face
flushed and with a quick intake of the breath he straightened up and
threw back his head  He made a sweeping gesture as though to include
the island  Then you and I the tent the boats cabins trees
everything and La Bijou  Pouf and all are gone to the devil

Frona shook her head  It is too bad

Bad  Pardon  Magnificent

No no baron not that  But that you are not an AngloSaxon  The
race could well be proud of you

And you Frona would you not glorify the French

At it again eh  Throwing bouquets at yourselves  Del Bishop
grinned at them and made to depart as quickly as he had come  But
twist yourselves  Some sick men in a cabin down here  Got to get em
out  Youre needed  And dont be all day about it he shouted over
his shoulder as he disappeared among the trees

The river was still rising though more slowly and as soon as they
left the high ground they were splashing along ankledeep in the water
Winding in and out among the trees they came upon a boat which had
been hauled out the previous fall  And three chechaquos who had
managed to get into the country thus far over the ice had piled
themselves into it also their tent sleds and dogs  But the boat was
perilously near the icegorge which growled and wrestled and
overtopped it a bare dozen feet away

Come  Get out of this you fools Jacob Welse shouted as he went
past

Del Bishop had told them to get the hell out of there when he ran by
and they could not understand  One of them turned up an unheeding
terrified face  Another lay prone and listless across the thwarts as
though bereft of strength while the third with the face of a clerk
rocked back and forth and moaned monotonously My God  My God

The baron stopped long enough to shake him  Damn he cried  Your
legs mannot God but your legs  Ah ahhump yourself  Yes
hump  Get a move on  Twist  Get back from the bank  The woods the
trees anywhere

He tried to drag him out but the man struck at him savagely and held
back

How one collects the vernacular he confided proudly to Frona as they
hurried on  Twist  It is a strong word and suitable

You should travel with Del she laughed  Hed increase your stock
in no time

You dont say so

Yes but I do

Ah  Your idioms  I shall never learn  And he shook his head
despairingly with both his hands

They came out in a clearing where a cabin stood close to the river
On its flat earthroof two sick men swathed in blankets were lying
while Bishop Corliss and Jacob Welse were splashing about inside the
cabin after the clothesbags and general outfit  The mean depth of the
flood was a couple of feet but the floor of the cabin had been dug out
for purposes of warmth and there the water was to the waist

Keep the tobacco dry one of the sick men said feebly from the roof

Tobacco hell his companion advised  Look out for the flour  And
the sugar he added as an afterthought

Thats cause Bill he dont smoke miss the first man explained
But keep an eye on it wont you he pleaded

Here  Now shut up Del tossed the canister beside him and the man
clutched it as though it were a sack of nuggets

Can I be of any use she asked looking up at them

Nope  Scurvy  Nothingll do em any good but Gods country and raw
potatoes  The pocketminer regarded her for a moment  What are you
doing here anyway  Go on back to high ground

But with a groan and a crash the icewall bulged in  A fiftyton cake
ended over splashing them with muddy water and settled down before
the door  A smaller cake drove against the outjutting cornerlogs and
the cabin reeled  Courbertin and Jacob Welse were inside

After you Frona heard the baron and then her fathers short amused
laugh and the gallant Frenchman came out last squeezing his way
between the cake and the logs

Say Bill if that there lower jam holds were goners the man with
the canister called to his partner

Ay that it will came the answer  Below Nulato I saw Bixbie Island
swept clean as my old mothers kitchen floor

The men came hastily together about Frona

This wont do  Weve got to carry them over to your shack Corliss
As he spoke Jacob Welse clambered nimbly up the cabin and gazed down
at the big barrier  Wheres McPherson he asked

Petrified astride the ridgepole this last hour

Jacob Welse waved his arm  Its breaking  There she goes

No kitchen floor this time  Bill with my respects to your old
woman called he of the tobacco

Ay answered the imperturbable Bill

The whole river seemed to pick itself up and start down the stream
With the increasing motion the icewall broke in a hundred places and
from up and down the shore came the rending and crashing of uprooted
trees

Corliss and Bishop laid hold of Bill and started off to McPhersons
and Jacob Welse and the baron were just sliding his mate over the
eaves when a huge block of ice rammed in and smote the cabin squarely
Frona saw it and cried a warning but the tiered logs were overthrown
like a house of cards  She saw Courbertin and the sick man hurled
clear of the wreckage and her father go down with it  She sprang to
the spot but he did not rise  She pulled at him to get his mouth
above water but at full stretch his head barely showed  Then she let
go and felt about with her hands till she found his right arm jammed
between the logs  These she could not move but she thrust between
them one of the roofpoles which had underlaid the dirt and moss  It
was a rude handspike and hardly equal to the work for when she threw
her weight upon the free end it bent and crackled  Heedful of the
warning she came in a couple of feet and swung upon it tentatively and
carefully till something gave and Jacob Welse shoved his muddy face
into the air

He drew half a dozen great breaths and burst out But that tastes
good  And then throwing a quick glance about him  Frona Del Bishop
is a most veracious man

Why she asked perplexedly

Because he said youd do you know

He kissed her and they both spat the mud from their lips laughing
Courbertin floundered round a corner of the wreckage

Never was there such a man he cried gleefully  He is mad crazy
There is no appeasement  His skull is cracked by the fall and his
tobacco is gone  It is chiefly the tobacco which is lamentable

But his skull was not cracked for it was merely a slit of the scalp of
five inches or so

Youll have to wait till the others come back  I cant carry Jacob
Welse pointed to his right arm which hung dead  Only wrenched he
explained  No bones broken

The baron struck an extravagant attitude and pointed down at Fronas
foot  Ah  the water it is gone and there a jewel of the flood a
pearl of price

Her wellworn moccasins had gone rotten from the soaking and a little
white toe peeped out at the world of slime

Then I am indeed wealthy baron for I have nine others

And who shall deny who shall deny he cried fervently

What a ridiculous foolish lovable fellow it is

I kiss your hand  And he knelt gallantly in the muck

She jerked her hand away and burying it with its mate in his curly
mop shook his head back and forth  What shall I do with him father

Jacob Welse shrugged his shoulders and laughed and she turned
Courbertins face up and kissed him on the lips  And Jacob Welse knew
that his was the larger share in that manifest joy


The river fallen to its winter level was pounding its iceglut
steadily along  But in falling it had rimmed the shore with a
twentyfoot wall of stranded floes  The great blocks were spilled
inland among the thrown and standing trees and the slimecoated flowers
and grasses like the titanic vomit of some Northland monster  The sun
was not idle and the steaming thaw washed the mud and foulness from
the bergs till they blazed like heaped diamonds in the brightness or
shimmered opalescentblue  Yet they were reared hazardously one on
another and ever and anon flashing towers and rainbow minarets
crumbled thunderously into the flood  By one of the gaps so made lay
La Bijou and about it saving chechaquos and sick men were grouped
the denizens of Splitup

Na na lad twa menll be a plenty  Tommy McPherson sought about
him with his eyes for corroboration  Gin ye gat three i the canoe
twill be ower comfortable

It must be a dash or nothing Corliss spoke up  We need three men
Tommy and you know it

Na na twas a plenty Im tellin ye

But Im afraid well have to do with two

The ScotchCanadian evinced his satisfaction openly  Maird be a
bother an I doot not yell mak it all richt lad

And youll make one of those two Tommy Corliss went on inexorably

Na theres ithers a plenty wioot coontin me

No theres not  Courbertin doesnt know the first thing  St
Vincent evidently cannot cross the slough  Mr Welses arm puts him
out of it  So its only you and I Tommy

Ill not be inqueesitive but yon son of Anaks a likely mon  He maun
pit oop a guid stroke  While the Scot did not lose much love for the
truculent pocketminer he was well aware of his grit and seized the
chance to save himself by shoving the other into the breach

Del Bishop stepped into the centre of the little circle paused and
looked every man in the eyes before he spoke

Is there a man herell say Im a coward he demanded without preface
Again he looked each one in the eyes  Or is there a man wholl even
hint that I ever did a curlike act  And yet again he searched the
circle  Well and good  I hate the water but Ive never been afraid
of it  I dont know how to swim yet Ive been over the side more
times than its good to remember  I cant pull an oar without batting
my back on the bottom of the boat  As for steeringwell authorities
say theres thirtytwo points to the compass but theres at least
thirty more when I get started  And as sure as God made little apples
I dont know my elbow from my knee about a paddle  Ive capsized damn
near every canoe I ever set foot in  Ive gone right through the
bottom of two  Ive turned turtle in the Canyon and been pulled out
below the White Horse  I can only keep stroke with one man and that
mans yours truly  But gentlemen if the call comes Ill take my
place in La Bijou and take her to hell if she dont turn over on the
way

Baron Courbertin threw his arms about him crying As sure as God made
little apples thou art a man

Tommys face was white and he sought refuge in speech from the silence
which settled down  Ill deny I lift a guid paddle nor that my wind
is fair but gin ye gang a tithe the way the next jamll be on us  For
my pairt I conseeder it ay rash  Bide a wee till the rivers clear
say I

Its no go Tommy Jacob Welse admonished  You cant cash excuses
here

But mon  It doesna need discreemeenation

Thatll do from Corliss  Youre coming

Ill naething o the sort  Ill

Shut up  Del had come into the world with lungs of leather and
larynx of brass and when he thus jerked out the stops the Scotsman
quailed and shrank down

Oyez  Oyez  In contrast to Dels siren tones Fronas were purest
silver as they rippled downisland through the trees  Oyez  Oyez
Open water  Open water  And wait a minute  Ill be with you

Three miles upstream where the Yukon curved grandly in from the west
a bit of water appeared  It seemed too marvellous for belief after
the granite winter but McPherson untouched of imagination began a
crafty retreat

Bide a wee bide a wee he protested when collared by the
pocketminer  Ave forgot my pipe

Then youll bide with us Tommy Del sneered  And Id let you have
a draw of mine if your own wasnt sticking out of your pocket

Twas the baccy Id in mind

Then dig into this  He shoved his pouch into McPhersons shaking
hands  Youd better shed your coat  Here  Ill help you  And
private Tommy if you dont act the man I wont do a thing to you
Sure

Corliss had stripped his heavy flannel shirt for freedom and it was
plain when Frona joined them that she also had been shedding  Jacket
and skirt were gone and her underskirt of dark cloth ceased midway
below the knee

Youll do Del commended

Jacob Welse looked at her anxiously and went over to where she was
testing the grips of the several paddles  Youre not he began

She nodded

Youre a guid girl McPherson broke in  Now ave a wumman to home
to say naething o three bairns

All ready  Corliss lifted the bow of La Bijou and looked back

The turbid water lashed by on the heels of the icerun  Courbertin
took the stern in the steep descent and Del marshalled Tommys
reluctant rear  A flat floe dipping into the water at a slight
incline served as the embarkingstage

Into the bow with you Tommy

The Scotsman groaned felt Bishop breathe heavily at his back and
obeyed Frona meeting his weight by slipping into the stern

I can steer she assured Corliss who for the first time was aware
that she was coming

He glanced up to Jacob Welse as though for consent and received it

Hit er up  Hit er up Del urged impatiently  Youre burnin
daylight




CHAPTER XXV

La Bijou was a perfect expression of all that was dainty and delicate
in the boatbuilders soul  Light as an eggshell and as fragile her
threeeighthsinch skin offered no protection from a driving chunk of
ice as small as a mans head  Nor though the water was open did she
find a clear way for the river was full of scattered floes which had
crumbled down from the rimice  And here at once through skilful
handling Corliss took to himself confidence in Frona

It was a great picture the river rushing blackly between its
crystalline walls beyond the green woods stretching upward to touch
the cloudflecked summer sky and over all like a furnace blast the
hot sun beating down  A great picture but somehow Corlisss mind
turned to his mother and her perennial tea the soft carpets the prim
New England maidservants the canaries singing in the wide windows
and he wondered if she could understand  And when he thought of the
woman behind him and felt the dip and lift dip and lift of her
paddle his mothers women came back to him one by one and passed in
long reviewpale glimmering ghosts he thought caricatures of the
stock which had replenished the earth and which would continue to
replenish the earth

La Bijou skirted a pivoting floe darted into a nipping channel and
shot out into the open with the walls grinding together behind  Tommy
groaned

Well done Corliss encouraged

The fule wumman came the backward snarl  Why couldna she bide a
bit

Frona caught his words and flung a laugh defiantly  Vance darted a
glance over his shoulder to her and her smile was witchery  Her cap
perched precariously was sliding off while her flying hair aglint in
the sunshine framed her face as he had seen it framed on the Dyea
Trail

How I should like to sing if it werent for saving ones breath  Say
the Song of the Sword or the Anchor Chanty

Or the First Chanty Corliss answered  Mine was the woman
darkling I found her he hummed significantly

She flashed her paddle into the water on the opposite side in order to
go wide of a jagged cake and seemed not to hear  I could go on this
way forever

And I Corliss affirmed warmly

But she refused to take notice saying instead Vance do you know
Im glad were friends

No fault of mine were not more

Youre losing your stroke sir she reprimanded and he bent silently
to the work

La Bijou was driving against the current at an angle of fortyfive
degrees and her resultant course was a line at right angles to the
river  Thus she would tap the western bank directly opposite the
startingpoint where she could work upstream in the slacker flood
But a mile of indented shore and then a hundred yards of bluffs rising
precipitously from out a stiff current would still lie between them and
the man to be rescued

Now let us ease up Corliss advised as they slipped into an eddy and
drifted with the backtide under the great wall of rimice

Who would think it midMay  She glanced up at the carelessly poised
cakes  Does it seem real to you Vance

He shook his head

Nor to me  I know that I Frona in the flesh am here in a
Peterborough paddling for dear life with two men year of our Lord
eighteen hundred and ninetyeight Alaska Yukon River this is water
that is ice my arms are tired my heart up a few beats and I am
sweatingand yet it seems all a dream  Just think  A year ago I was
in Paris  She drew a deep breath and looked out over the water to the
further shore where Jacob Welses tent like a snowy handkerchief
sprawled against the deep green of the forest  I do not believe there
is such a place she added  There is no Paris

And I was in London a twelvemonth past Corliss meditated  But I
have undergone a new incarnation  London  There is no London now  It
is impossible  How could there be so many people in the world  This
is the world and we know of fact that there are very few people in it
else there could not be so much ice and sea and sky  Tommy here I
know thinks fondly of a place he calls Toronto  He mistakes  It
exists only in his minda memory of a former life he knew  Of
course he does not think so  That is but natural for he is no
philosopher nor does he bother

Wheest will ye Tommy fiercely whispered  Your gabblell bring it
doon aboot oor heads

Life is brief in the Northland and fulfilment ever clutters the heels
of prophecy  A premonitory tremor sighed down the air and the rainbow
wall swayed above them  The three paddles gripped the water with
common accord  La Bijou leaped out from under  Broadside after
broadside flared and crashed and a thousand frigid tons thundered down
behind them  The displaced water surged outward in a foamy upstanding
circle and La Bijou striving wildly to rise ducked through the stiff
overhang of the crest and wallowed halffull in the trough

Dinna I tell ye ye gabbling fules

Sit still and bail Corliss checked him sharply  Or youll not
have the comfort of telling us anything

He shook his head at Frona and she winked back then they both
chuckled much like children over an escapade which looks disastrous
but turns out well

Creeping timidly under the shadow of the impending avalanches La Bijou
slipped noiselessly up the last eddy  A corner of the bluff rose
savagely from the rivera monstrous mass of naked rock scarred and
battered of the centuries hating the river that gnawed it ever hating
the rain that graved its grim face with unsightly seams hating the sun
that refused to mate with it whereof green life might come forth and
hide its hideousness  The whole force of the river hurled in against
it waged furious war along its battlements and caromed off into
midstream again  Down all its length the stiff waves stood in serried
rows and its crevices and waterworn caverns were abellow with unseen
strife

Now  Bend to it  Your best

It was the last order Corliss could give for in the din they were
about to enter a mans voice were like a crickets chirp amid the
growling of an earthquake  La Bijou sprang forward cleared the eddy
with a bound and plunged into the thick  Dip and lift dip and
lift the paddles worked with rhythmic strength  The water rippled
and tore and pulled all ways at once and the fragile shell unable to
go all ways at once shook and quivered with the shock of resistance
It veered nervously to the right and left but Frona held it with a
hand of steel  A yard away a fissure in the rock grinned at them  La
Bijou leaped and shot ahead and the water slipping away underneath
kept her always in one place  Now they surged out from the fissure
now in ahead for half a yard then back again and the fissure mocked
their toil

Five minutes each of which sounded a separate eternity and the
fissure was past  Ten minutes and it was a hundred feet astern  Dip
and lift dip and lift till sky and earth and river were blotted out
and consciousness dwindled to a thin linea streak of foam fringed
on the one hand with sneering rock on the other with snarling water
That thin line summed up all  Somewhere below was the beginning of
things somewhere above beyond the roar and traffic was the end of
things and for that end they strove

And still Frona held the eggshell with a hand of steel  What they
gained they held and fought for more inch by inch dip and lift
and all would have been well but for the flutter of Tommys soul  A
cake of ice sucked beneath by the current rose under his paddle with
a flurry of foam turned over its toothed edge and was dragged back
into the depths  And in that sight he saw himself hair streaming
upward and drowned hands clutching emptiness going feet first down
and down  He stared wideeyed at the portent and his poised paddle
refused to strike  On the instant the fissure grinned in their faces
and the next they were below the bluffs drifting gently in the eddy

Frona lay head thrown back sobbing at the sun amidships Corliss
sprawled panting and forward choking and gasping and nerveless the
Scotsman drooped his head upon his knees  La Bijou rubbed softly
against the rimice and came to rest  The rainbowwall hung above like
a fairy pile the sun flung backward from innumerable facets clothed
it in jewelled splendor  Silvery streams tinkled down its crystal
slopes and in its clear depths seemed to unfold veil on veil the
secrets of life and death and mortal strivingvistas of
paleshimmering azure opening like dreamvisions and promising down
there in the great cool heart infinite rest infinite cessation and
rest

The topmost tower delicately massive a score of feet above them
swayed to and fro gently like the ripple of wheat in light summer
airs  But Corliss gazed at it unheeding  Just to lie there on the
marge of the mystery just to lie there and drink the air in great
gulps and do nothinghe asked no more  A dervish whirling on heel
till all things blur may grasp the essence of the universe and prove
the Godhead indivisible and so a man plying a paddle and plying and
plying may shake off his limitations and rise above time and space
And so Corliss

But gradually his blood ceased its mad pounding and the air was no
longer nectarsweet and a sense of things real and pressing came back
to him

Weve got to get out of this he said  His voice sounded like a
mans whose throat has been scorched by many and long potations  It
frightened him but he limply lifted a shaking paddle and shoved off

Yes let us start by all means Frona said in a dim voice which
seemed to come to him from a far distance

Tommy lifted his head and gazed about  A doot well juist hae to gie
it oop

Bend to it

Yell no try it anither

Bend to it Corliss repeated

Till your heart bursts Tommy Frona added

Once again they fought up the thin line and all the world vanished
save the streak of foam and the snarling water and the grinning
fissure  But they passed it inch by inch and the broad bend welcomed
them from above and only a rocky buttress of implacable hate around
whose base howled the tides of an equal hate stood between  Then La
Bijou leaped and throbbed and shook again and the current slid out
from under and they remained ever in one place  Dip and lift dip
and lift through an infinity of time and torture and travail till
even the line dimmed and faded and the struggle lost its meaning
Their souls became merged in the rhythm of the toil  Ever lifting
ever falling they seemed to have become great pendulums of time  And
before and behind glimmered the eternities and between the eternities
ever lifting ever falling they pulsed in vast rhythmical movement
They were no longer humans but rhythms  They surged in till their
paddles touched the bitter rock but they did not know surged out
where chance piloted them unscathed through the lashing ice but they
did not see  Nor did they feel the shock of the smitten waves nor the
driving spray that cooled their faces  

La Bijou veered out into the stream and their paddles flashing
mechanically in the sunshine held her to the return angle across the
river  As time and matter came back to them and Splitup Island
dawned upon their eyes like the foreshore of a new world they settled
down to the long easy stroke wherein breath and strength may be
recovered

A third attempt would have been useless Corliss said in a dry
cracked whisper

And Frona answered Yes our hearts would have surely broken

Life and the pleasant campfire and the quiet rest in the noonday
shade came back to Tommy as the shore drew near and more than all
blessed Toronto its houses that never moved and its jostling streets
Each time his head sank forward and he reached out and clutched the
water with his paddle the streets enlarged as though gazing through a
telescope and adjusting to a nearer focus  And each time the paddle
drove clear and his head was raised the island bounded forward  His
head sank and the streets were of the size of life it raised and
Jacob Welse and the two men stood on the bank three lengths away

Dinna I tell ye he shouted to them triumphantly

But Frona jerked the canoe parallel with the bank and he found himself
gazing at the long upstream stretch  He arrested a stroke midway and
his paddle clattered in the bottom

Pick it up Corlisss voice was sharp and relentless

Ill do naething o the kind  He turned a rebellious face on his
tormentor and ground his teeth in anger and disappointment

The canoe was drifting down with the current and Frona merely held it
in place  Corliss crawled forward on his knees

I dont want to hurt you Tommy he said in a low tense voice so
    well just pick it up thats a good fellow

Ill no

Then I shall kill you Corliss went on in the same calm passionless
way at the same time drawing his huntingknife from its sheath

And if I dinna the Scotsman queried stoutly though cowering away

Corliss pressed gently with the knife  The point of the steel entered
Tommys back just where the heart should be passed slowly through the
shirt and bit into the skin  Nor did it stop there neither did it
quicken but just as slowly held on its way  He shrank back quivering

There there man  Pit it oop he shrieked  I maun gie in

Fronas face was quite pale but her eyes were hard brilliantly hard
and she nodded approval

Were going to try this side and shoot across from above she called
to her father  What  I cant hear  Tommy  Oh his hearts weak
Nothing serious  She saluted with her paddle  Well be back in no
time father mine  In no time

Stewart River was wide open and they ascended it a quarter of a mile
before they shot its mouth and continued up the Yukon  But when they
were well abreast of the man on the opposite bank a new obstacle faced
them  A mile above a wreck of an island clung desperately to the
river bed  Its tail dwindled to a sandspit which bisected the river
as far down as the impassable bluffs  Further a few hundred thousand
tons of ice had grounded upon the spit and upreared a glittering ridge

Well have to portage Corliss said as Frona turned the canoe from
the bank

La Bijou darted across the narrower channel to the sandspit and
slipped up a little ice ravine where the walls were less precipitous
They landed on an outjutting cake which without support overhung
the water for sheer thirty feet  How far its other end could be buried
in the mass was matter for conjecture  They climbed to the summit
dragging the canoe after them and looked out over the dazzle  Floe
was piled on floe in titanic confusion  Huge blocks topped and
overtopped one another only to serve as pedestals for great white
masses which blazed and scintillated in the sun like monstrous jewels

A bonny place for a bit walk Tommy sneered wi the next jam fair
to come ony time  He sat down resolutely  No thank ye kindly Ill
no try it

Frona and Corliss clambered on the canoe between them

The Persians lashed their slaves into battle she remarked looking
back  I never understood before  Hadnt you better go back after
him

Corliss kicked him up whimpering and forced him to go on in advance
The canoe was an affair of little weight but its bulk on the steep
rises and sharp turns taxed their strength  The sun burned down upon
them  Its white glare hurt their eyes the sweat oozed out from every
pore and they panted for breath

Oh Vance do you know   

What  He swept the perspiration from his forehead and flung it from
him with a quick flirt of the hand

I wish I had eaten more breakfast

He grunted sympathetically  They had reached the midmost ridge and
could see the open river and beyond quite clearly the man and his
signal of distress  Below pastoral in its green quiet lay Splitup
Island  They looked up to the broad bend of the Yukon smiling lazily
as though it were not capable at any moment of spewing forth a flood of
death  At their feet the ice sloped down into a miniature gorge
across which the sun cast a broad shadow

Go on Tommy Frona bade  Were halfway over and theres water
down there

Its water yed be thinkin on is it he snarled and you aleadin
a buddie to his death

I fear you have done some great sin Tommy she said with a
reproving shake of the head or else you would not be so afraid of
death  She sighed and picked up her end of the canoe  Well I
suppose it is natural  You do not know how to die

No more do I want to die he broke in fiercely

But there come times for all men to dietimes when to die is the
only thing to do  Perhaps this is such a time

Tommy slid carefully over a glistening ledge and dropped his height to
a broad foothold  Its a vera guid he grinned up but dinna ye
think ave suffeecient discreemeenation to judge for mysel  Why
should I no sing my ain sang

Because you do not know how  The strong have ever pitched the key for
such as you  It is they that have taught your kind when and how to
die and led you to die and lashed you to die

Ye pit it fair he rejoined  And ye do it weel  It doesna behoove
me to complain sic a michty fine job yere makin on it

You are doing well Corliss chuckled as Tommy dropped out of sight
and landed into the bed of the gorge  The cantankerous brute hed
argue on the trail to Judgment

Where did you learn to paddle she asked

Collegeexercise he answered shortly  But isnt that fine
Look

The melting ice had formed a pool in the bottom of the gorge  Frona
stretched out full length and dipped her hot mouth in its coolness
And lying as she did the soles of her dilapidated moccasins or rather
the soles of her feet for moccasins and stockings had gone in shreds
were turned upward  They were very white and from contact with the
ice were bruised and cut  Here and there the blood oozed out and from
one of the toes it streamed steadily

So wee and pretty and saltlike Tommy gibed  One wouldna think
they could lead a strong man to hell

By the way you grumble theyre leading you fast enough Corliss
answered angrily

Forty mile an hour Tommy retorted as he walked away gloating over
having the last word

One moment  Youve two shirts  Lend me one

The Scotsmans face lighted inquisitively till he comprehended  Then
he shook his head and started on again

Frona scrambled to her feet  Whats the matter

Nothing  Sit down

But what is the matter

Corliss put his hands on her shoulders and pressed her back  Your
feet  You cant go on in such shape  Theyre in ribbons  See  He
brushed the sole of one of them and held up a blooddripping palm
Why didnt you tell me

Oh they didnt bothermuch

Give me one of your skirts he demanded

I     She faltered  I only have one

He looked about him  Tommy had disappeared among the icefloes

We must be getting on Frona said attempting to rise

But he held her back  Not another step till I fix you  Here goes so
shut your eyes

She obeyed and when she opened them he was naked to the waist and his
undershirt torn in strips was being bound about her feet

You were in the rear and I did not know

Dont apologize pray she interrupted  I could have spoken

Im not Im reproaching you  Now the other one  Put it up

The nearness to her bred a madness and he touched his lips lightly to
the same white little toe that had won the Baron Courbertin a kiss

Though she did not draw back her face flushed and she thrilled as she
had thrilled once before in her life  You take advantage of your own
goodness she rebuked him

Then I will doubly advantage myself

Please dont she begged

And why not  It is a custom of the sea to broach the spirits as the
ship prepares to sink  And since this is a sort of a forlorn hope you
know why not

But   

But what Miss Prim

Oh  Of all things you know I do not deserve that  If there were
nobody else to be considered why under the circumstances   

He drew the last knot tight and dropped her foot  Damn St Vincent
anyway  Come on

So would I were I you she laughed taking up her end of the canoe
But how you have changed Vance  You are not the same man I met on
the Dyea Trail  You hadnt learned to swear then among other things

No Im not the same for which I thank God and you  Only I think I
am honester than you  I always live up to my philosophy

Now confess thats unfair  You ask too much under the
circumstances

Only a little toe

Or else I suppose you just care for me in a kind bigbrotherly way
In which case if you really wish it you may

Do keep quiet he broke in roughly or Ill be making a gorgeous
fool of myself

Kiss all my toes she finished

He grunted but did not deign a reply  The work quickly took their
breath and they went on in silence till they descended the last steep
to where McPherson waited by the open river

Del hates St Vincent she said boldly  Why

Yes it seems that way  He glanced back at her curiously  And
wherever he goes Del lugs an old Russian book which he cant read but
which he nevertheless regards in some sort of way as St Vincents
Nemesis  And do you know Frona he has such faith in it that I cant
help catching a little myself  I dont know whether youll come to me
or whether Ill go to you but

She dropped her end of the canoe and broke out in laughter  He was
annoyed and a hurt spread of blood ruddied his face

If I have he began

Stupid she laughed  Dont be silly  And above all dont be
dignified  It doesnt exactly become you at the present momentyour
hair all tangled a murderous knife in your belt and naked to the
waist like a pirate stripped for battle  Be fierce frown swear
anything but please dont be dignified  I do wish I had my camera
In after years I could say This my friends is Corliss the great
Arctic explorer just as he looked at the conclusion of his
worldfamous trip Through Darkest Alaska

He pointed an ominous finger at her and said sternly Where is your
skirt

She involuntarily looked down  But its tatterdemalion presence
relieved her and her face jerked up scarlet

You should be ashamed

Please please do not be dignified he laughed  Very true it
doesnt exactly become you at the present moment  Now if I had my
camera

Do be quiet and go on she said  Tommy is waiting  I hope the sun
takes the skin all off your back she panted vindictively as they
slid the canoe down the last shelf and dropped it into the water

Ten minutes later they climbed the icewall and on and up the bank
which was partly a hillside to where the signal of distress still
fluttered  Beneath it on the ground lay stretched the man  He lay
very quietly and the fear that they were too late was upon them when
he moved his head slightly and moaned  His rough clothes were in rags
and the black bruised flesh of his feet showed through the remnants of
his moccasins  His body was thin and gaunt without fleshpads or
muscles while the bones seemed ready to break through the
tightstretched skin  As Corliss felt his pulse his eyes fluttered
open and stared glassily  Frona shuddered

Man its fair gruesome McPherson muttered running his hand up a
shrunken arm

You go on to the canoe Frona Corliss said  Tommy and I will carry
him down

But her lips set firmly  Though the descent was made easier by her
aid the man was well shaken by the time they laid him in the bottom of
the canoeso well shaken that some last shreds of consciousness were
aroused  He opened his eyes and whispered hoarsely Jacob Welse   
despatches     from the Outside  He plucked feebly at his open
shirt and across his emaciated chest they saw the leather strap to
which doubtless the despatchpouch was slung

At either end of the canoe there was room to spare but amidships
Corliss was forced to paddle with the man between his knees  La Bijou
swung out blithely from the bank  It was downstream at last and
there was little need for exertion

Vances arms and shoulders and back a bright scarlet caught Fronas
attention  My hopes are realized she exulted reaching out and
softly stroking a burning arm  We shall have to put cold cream on it
when we get back

Go ahead he encouraged  That feels awfully good

She splashed his hot back with a handful of the icecold water from
overside  He caught his breath with a gasp and shivered  Tommy
turned about to look at them

Its a guid deed well a doon this day he remarked pleasantly
To gie a hand in distress is guid i the sight of God

Whos afeared  Frona laughed

Weel he deliberated I was a bit fashed no doot but

His utterance ceased and he seemed suddenly to petrify  His eyes
fixed themselves in a terrible stare over Fronas shoulder  And then
slowly and dreamily with the solemnity fitting an invocation of Deity
murmured Guid Gawd Almichty

They whirled their heads about  A wall of ice was sweeping round the
bend and even as they looked the righthand flank unable to compass
the curve struck the further shore and flung up a ridge of heaving
mountains

Guid Gawd  Guid Gawd  Like rats i the trap Tommy jabbed his
paddle futilely in the water

Get the stroke Corliss hissed in his ear and La Bijou sprang away

Frona steered straight across the current at almost right angles for
Splitup but when the sandspit over which they had portaged crashed
at the impact of a million tons Corliss glanced at her anxiously  She
smiled and shook her head at the same time slacking off the course

We cant make it she whispered looking back at the ice a couple of
hundred feet away  Our only chance is to run before it and work in
slowly

She cherished every inward inch jealously holding the canoe up as
sharply as she dared and at the same time maintaining a constant
distance ahead of the icerim

I canna stand the pace Tommy whimpered once but the silence of
Corliss and Frona seemed ominous and he kept his paddle going

At the very fore of the ice was a floe five or six feet thick and a
couple of acres in extent  Reaching out in advance of the pack it
clove through the water till on either side there formed a bore like
that of a quick floodtide in an inland passage  Tommy caught sight of
it and would have collapsed had not Corliss prodded him between
strokes with the point of his paddle

We can keep ahead Frona panted but we must get time to make the
landing

When the chance comes drive her in bow on Corliss counselled and
when she strikes jump and run for it

Climb rather  Im glad my skirt is short

Repulsed by the bluffs of the left bank the ice was forced towards the
right  The big floe in advance drove in upon the precise point of
Splitup Island

If you look back Ill brain you with the paddle Corliss threatened

Ay Tommy groaned

But Corliss looked back and so did Frona  The great berg struck the
land with an earthquake shock  For fifty feet the soft island was
demolished  A score of pines swayed frantically and went down and
where they went down rose up a mountain of ice which rose and fell
and rose again  Below and but a few feet away Del Bishop ran out to
the bank and above the roar they could hear faintly his Hit er up
Hit er up Then the icerim wrinkled up and he sprang back to escape
it

The first opening Corliss gasped

Fronas lips spread apart she tried to speak but failed then nodded
her head that she had heard  They swung along in rapid rhythm under
the rainbowwall looking for a place where it might be quickly
cleared  And down all the length of Splitup Island they raced vainly
the shore crashing behind them as they fled

As they darted across the mouth of the backchannel to Roubeau Island
they found themselves heading directly for an opening in the rimice
La Bijou drove into it full tilt and went half her length out of water
on a shelving cake  The three leaped together but while the two of
them gripped the canoe to run it up Tommy in the lead strove only to
save himself  And he would have succeeded had he not slipped and
fallen midway in the climb  He half arose slipped and fell again
Corliss hauling on the bow of the canoe trampled over him  He
reached up and clutched the gunwale  They did not have the strength
and this clog brought them at once to a standstill  Corliss looked
back and yelled for him to leave go but he only turned upward a
piteous face like that of a drowning man and clutched more tightly
Behind them the ice was thundering  The first flurry of coming
destruction was upon them  They endeavored desperately to drag up the
canoe but the added burden was too much and they fell on their knees
The sick man sat up suddenly and laughed wildly  Blood of my soul
he ejaculated and laughed again

Roubeau Island swayed to the first shock and the ice was rocking under
their feet  Frona seized a paddle and smashed the Scotsmans knuckles
and the instant he loosed his grip Corliss carried the canoe up in a
mad rush Frona clinging on and helping from behind  The rainbowwall
curled up like a scroll and in the convolutions of the scroll like a
bee in the many folds of a magnificent orchid Tommy disappeared

They fell breathless on the earth  But a monstrous cake shoved up
from the jam and balanced above them  Frona tried to struggle to her
feet but sank on her knees and it remained for Corliss to snatch her
and the canoe out from underneath  Again they fell this time under
the trees the sun sifting down upon them through the green pine
needles the robins singing overhead and a colony of crickets chirping
in the warmth




CHAPTER XXVI

Frona woke slowly as though from a long dream  She was lying where
she had fallen across Corlisss legs while he on his back faced the
hot sun without concern  She crawled up to him  He was breathing
regularly with closed eyes which opened to meet hers  He smiled and
she sank down again  Then he rolled over on his side and they looked
at each other

Vance

Yes

She reached out her hand his closed upon it and their eyelids
fluttered and drooped down  The river still rumbled en somewhere in
the infinite distance but it came to them like the murmur of a world
forgotten  A soft languor encompassed them  The golden sunshine
dripped down upon them through the living green and all the life of
the warm earth seemed singing  And quiet was very good  Fifteen long
minutes they drowsed and woke again

Frona sat up  II was afraid she said

Not you

Afraid that I might be afraid she amended fumbling with her hair

Leave it down  The day merits it

She complied with a toss of the head which circled it with a nimbus of
rippling yellow

Tommys gone Corliss mused the race with the ice coming slowly back

Yes she answered  I rapped him on the knuckles  It was terrible
But the chance is weve a better man in the canoe and we must care for
him at once  Hello  Look there  Through the trees not a score of
feet away she saw the wall of a large cabin  Nobody in sight  It
must be deserted or else theyre visiting whoever they are  You look
to our man VanceIm more presentableand Ill go and see

She skirted the cabin which was a large one for the Yukon country and
came around to where it fronted on the river  The door stood open
and as she paused to knock the whole interior flashed upon her in an
astounding picturea cumulative picture or series of pictures as it
were  For first she was aware of a crowd of men and of some great
common purpose upon which all were seriously bent  At her knock they
instinctively divided so that a lane opened up flanked by their
pressed bodies to the far end of the room  And there in the long
bunks on either side sat two grave rows of men  And midway between
against the wall was a table  This table seemed the centre of
interest  Fresh from the sundazzle the light within was dim and
murky but she managed to make out a bearded American sitting by the
table and hammering it with a heavy caulkingmallet  And on the
opposite side sat St Vincent  She had time to note his worn and
haggard face before a man of Scandinavian appearance slouched up to
the table

The man with the mallet raised his right hand and said glibly You do
most solemnly swear that what you are about to give before the
court  He abruptly stopped and glowered at the man before him
Take off your hat he roared and a snicker went up from the crowd as
the man obeyed

Then he of the mallet began again  You do most solemnly swear that
what you are about to give before the court shall be the truth the
whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God

The Scandinavian nodded and dropped his hand

One moment gentlemen  Frona advanced up the lane which closed
behind her

St Vincent sprang to his feet and stretched out his arms to her
Frona he cried oh Frona I am innocent

It struck her like a blow the unexpectedness of it and for the
instant in the sickly light she was conscious only of the ring of
white faces each face set with eyes that burned  Innocent of what
she thought and as she looked at St Vincent arms still extended she
was aware in a vague troubled way of something distasteful
Innocent of what  He might have had more reserve  He might have
waited till he was charged  She did not know that he was charged with
anything

Friend of the prisoner the man with the mallet said authoritatively
Bring a stool forard some of you

One moment     She staggered against the table and rested a hand
on it  I do not understand  This is all new     But her eyes
happened to come to rest on her feet wrapped in dirty rags and she
knew that she was clad in a short and tattered skirt that her arm
peeped forth through a rent in her sleeve and that her hair was down
and flying  Her cheek and neck on one side seemed coated with some
curious substance  She brushed it with her hand and caked mud rattled
to the floor

That will do the man said not unkindly  Sit down  Were in the
same box  We do not understand  But take my word for it were here
to find out  So sit down

She raised her hand  One moment

Sit down he thundered  The court cannot be disturbed

A hum went up from the crowd words of dissent and the man pounded the
table for silence  But Frona resolutely kept her feet

When the noise had subsided she addressed the man in the chair  Mr
Chairman I take it that this is a miners meeting  The man nodded
Then having an equal voice in the managing of this communitys
affairs I demand to be heard  It is important that I should be heard

But you are out of order  Misser

Welse half a dozen voices prompted

Miss Welse he went on an added respect marking his demeanor it
grieves me to inform you that you are out of order  You had best sit
down

I will not she answered  I rise to a question of privilege and if
I am not heard I shall appeal to the meeting

She swept the crowd with her eyes and cries went up that she be given
a fair show  The chairman yielded and motioned her to go on

Mr Chairman and men I do not know the business you have at present
before you but I do know that I have more important business to place
before you  Just outside this cabin is a man probably dying from
starvation  We have brought him from across the river  We should not
have bothered you but we were unable to make our own island  This man
I speak of needs immediate attention

A couple of you nearest the door go out and look after him the
chairman ordered  And you Doc Holiday go along and see what you can
do

Ask for a recess St Vincent whispered

Frona nodded her head  And Mr Chairman I make a motion for a
recess until the man is cared for

Cries of No recess and Go on with the business greeted the
putting of it and the motion was lost

Now Gregory with a smile and salutation as she took the stool
beside him what is it

He gripped her hand tightly  Dont believe them Frona  They are
trying towith a gulping swallowto kill me

Why  Do be calm  Tell me

Why last night he began hurriedly but broke off to listen to the
Scandinavian previously sworn who was speaking with ponderous slowness

I wake wide open quick he was saying  I coom to the door  I there
hear one shot more

He was interrupted by a warmcomplexioned man clad in faded mackinaws
What did you think he asked

Eh the witness queried his face dark and troubled with perplexity

When you came to the door what was your first thought

Aww the man sighed his face clearing and infinite comprehension
sounding in his voice  I have no moccasins  I tink pretty damn
cold  His satisfied expression changed to naive surprise when an
outburst of laughter greeted his statement but he went on stolidly
One more shot I hear and I run down the trail

Then Corliss pressed in through the crowd to Frona and she lost what
the man was saying

Whats up the engineer was asking  Anything serious  Can I be of
any use

Yes yes  She caught his hand gratefully  Get over the
backchannel somehow and tell my father to come  Tell him that Gregory
St Vincent is in trouble that he is charged with  What are you
charged with Gregory she asked turning to him

Murder

Murder from Corliss

Yes yes  Say that he is charged with murder that I am here and
that I need him  And tell him to bring me some clothes  And
Vancewith a pressure of the hand and swift upward lookdont
take any    any big chances but do try to make it

Oh Ill make it all right  He tossed his head confidently and
proceeded to elbow his way towards the door

Who is helping you in your defence she asked St Vincent

He shook his head  No  They wanted to appoint some onea renegade
lawyer from the States Bill Brownbut I declined him  Hes taken
the other side now  Its lynch law you know and their minds are
made up  Theyre bound to get me

I wish there were time to hear your side

But Frona I am innocent  I

Ssh  She laid her hand on his arm to hush him and turned her
attention to the witness

So the noospaper feller he fight like anything but Pierre and me we
pull him into the shack  He cry and stand in one place

Who cried interrupted the prosecuting lawyer

Him   That feller there  The Scandinavian pointed directly at St
Vincent  And I make a light  The slushlamp I find spilt over most
everything but I have a candle in my pocket  It is good practice to
carry a candle in the pocket he affirmed gravely  And Borg he lay
on the floor dead  And the squaw say he did it and then she die too

Said who did it

Again his accusing finger singled out St Vincent  Him  That feller
there

Did she Frona whispered

Yes St Vincent whispered back she did  But I cannot imagine what
prompted her  She must have been out of her head

The warmfaced man in the faded mackinaws then put the witness through
a searching examination which Frona followed closely but which
elicited little new

You have the right to crossexamine the witness the chairman
informed St Vincent  Any questions you want to ask

The correspondent shook his head

Go on Frona urged

Whats the use he asked hopelessly  Im foredoomed  The verdict
was reached before the trial began

One moment please  Fronas sharp command arrested the retiring
witness  You do not know of your own knowledge who committed this
murder

The Scandinavian gazed at her with a bovine expression on his leaden
features as though waiting for her question to percolate to his
understanding

You did not see who did it she asked again

Aw yes  That feller there accusative finger to the fore  She say
he did

There was a general smile at this

But you did not see it

I hear some shooting

But you did not see who did the shooting

Aw no but she said

That will do thank you she said sweetly and the man retired

The prosecution consulted its notes  Pierre La Flitche was called
out

A slender swartskinned man lithe of figure and graceful stepped
forward to the open space before the table  He was darkly handsome
with a quick eloquent eye which roved frankly everywhere  It rested
for a moment on Frona open and honest in its admiration and she
smiled and halfnodded for she liked him at first glance and it
seemed as though they had met of old time  He smiled pleasantly back
the smooth upper lip curling brightly and showing beautiful teeth
immaculately white

In answer to the stereotyped preliminaries he stated that his name was
that of his fathers a descendant of the coureurs du bois  His
motherwith a shrug of the shoulders and flash of teethwas a
breed  He was born somewhere in the Barrens on a hunting trip he
did not know where  Ah oui men called him an oldtimer  He had
come into the country in the days of Jack McQuestion across the
Rockies from the Great Slave

On being told to go ahead with what he knew of the matter in hand he
deliberated a moment as though casting about for the best departure

In the spring it is good to sleep with the open door he began his
words sounding clear and flutelike and marked by haunting memories of
the accents his forbears put into the tongue  And so I sleep last
night  But I sleep like the cat  The fall of the leaf the breath of
the wind and my ears whisper to me whisper whisper all the night
long  So the first shot with a quick snap of the fingers and I am
awake just like that and I am at the door

St Vincent leaned forward to Frona  It was not the first shot

She nodded with her eyes still bent on La Flitche who gallantly
waited

Then two more shot he went on quick together boomboom just
like that  Borgs shack I say to myself and run down the trail  I
think Borg kill Bella which was bad  Bella very fine girl he
confided with one of his irresistible smiles  I like Bella  So I
run  And John he run from his cabin like a fat cow with great noise
What the matter he say and I say I dont know  And then
something come wheugh out of the dark just like that and knock John
down and knock me down  We grab everywhere all at once  It is a man
He is in undress  He fight  He cry Oh  Oh  Oh just like that
We hold him tight and bimeby pretty quick he stop  Then we get up
and I say Come along back

Who was the man

La Flitche turned partly and rested his eyes on St Vincent

Go on

So  The man he will not go back but John and I say yes and he go

Did he say anything

I ask him what the matter but he cry he     he sob huhtsch
huhtsch just like that

Did you see anything peculiar about him

La Flitches brows drew up interrogatively

Anything uncommon out of the ordinary

Ah oui blood on the hands  Disregarding the murmur in the room
he went on his facile play of feature and gesture giving dramatic
value to the recital  John make a light and Bella groan like the
hairseal when you shoot him in the body just like that when you shoot
him in the body under the flipper  And Borg lay over in the corner  I
look  He no breathe tall

Then Bella open her eyes and I look in her eyes and I know she know
me La Flitche  Who did it Bella I ask  And she roll her head on
the floor and whisper so low so slow Him dead  I know she mean
Borg and I say yes  Then she lift up on one elbow and look about
quick in big hurry and when she see Vincent she look no more only
she look at Vincent all the time  Then she point at him just like
that  Suiting the action to the word La Flitche turned and thrust a
wavering finger at the prisoner  And she say Him him him  And I
say Bella who did it  And she say Him him him  St Vincha
him do it  And thenLa Flitches head felt limply forward on his
chest and came back naturally erect as he finished with a flash of
teeth Dead

The warmfaced man Bill Brown put the quarterbreed through the
customary direct examination which served to strengthen his testimony
and to bring out the fact that a terrible struggle must have taken
place in the killing of Borg  The heavy table was smashed the stool
and the bunkboard splintered and the stove overthrown  Never did I
see anything like it La Flitche concluded his description of the
wreck  No never

Brown turned him over to Frona with a bow which a smile of hers paid
for in full  She did not deem it unwise to cultivate cordiality with
the lawyer  What she was working for was timetime for her father to
come time to be closeted with St Vincent and learn all the details of
what really had occurred  So she put questions questions
interminable questions to La Flitche  Twice only did anything of
moment crop up

You spoke of the first shot Mr La Flitche  Now the walls of a log
cabin are quite thick  Had your door been closed do you think you
could have heard that first shot

He shook his head though his dark eyes told her he divined the point
she was endeavoring to establish

And had the door of Borgs cabin been closed would you have heard

Again he shook his head

Then Mr La Flitche when you say the first shot you do not mean
necessarily the first shot fired but rather the first shot you heard
fired

He nodded and though she had scored her point she could not see that
it had any material bearing after all

Again she worked up craftily to another and stronger climax though she
felt all the time that La Flitche fathomed her

You say it was very dark Mr La Flitche

Ah oui quite dark

How dark  How did you know it was John you met

John make much noise when he run  I know that kind of noise

Could you see him so as to know that it was he

Ah no

Then Mr La Flitche she demanded triumphantly will you please
state how you knew there was blood on the hands of Mr St Vincent

His lip lifted in a dazzling smile and he paused a moment  How  I
feel it warm on his hands  And my noseah the smoke of the hunter
camp long way off the hole where the rabbit hide the track of the
moose which has gone before does not my nose tell me  He flung his
head back and with tense face eyes closed nostrils quivering and
dilated he simulated the quiescence of all the senses save one and the
concentration of his whole being upon that one  Then his eyes
fluttered partly open and he regarded her dreamily  I smell the blood
on his hands the warm blood the hot blood on his hands

And by gad he can do it some man exclaimed

And so convinced was Frona that she glanced involuntarily at St
Vincents hands and saw there the rustybrown stains on the cuffs of
his flannel shirt

As La Flitche left the stand Bill Brown came over to her and shook
hands  No more than proper I should know the lawyer for the defence
he said goodnaturedly running over his notes for the next witness

But dont you think it is rather unfair to me she asked brightly
I have not had time to prepare my case  I know nothing about it
except what I have gleaned from your two witnesses  Dont you think
Mr Brown her voice rippling along in persuasive little notes dont
you think it would be advisable to adjourn the meeting until tomorrow

Hum he deliberated looking at his watch

Wouldnt be a bad idea  Its five oclock anyway and the men ought
to be cooking their suppers

She thanked him as some women can without speech yet as he looked
down into her face and eyes he experienced a subtler and greater
satisfaction than if she had spoken

He stepped to his old position and addressed the room  On
consultation of the defence and the prosecution and upon consideration
of the lateness of the hour and the impossibility of finishing the
trial within a reasonable limit IhumI take the liberty of moving
an adjournment until eight oclock tomorrow morning

The ayes have it the chairman proclaimed coming down from his place
and proceeding to build the fire for he was a partowner of the cabin
and cook for his crowd




CHAPTER XXVII

Frona turned to St Vincent as the last of the crowd filed out  He
clutched her hands spasmodically like a drowning man

Do believe me Frona  Promise me

Her face flushed  You are excited she said or you would not say
such things  Not that I blame you she relented  I hardly imagine
the situation can be anything else but exciting

Yes and well I know it he answered bitterly  I am acting like a
fool and I cant help it  The strain has been terrible  And as
though the horror of Borgs end were not enough to be considered the
murderer and haled up for mob justice  Forgive me Frona  I am
beside myself  Of course I know that you will believe me

Then tell me Gregory

In the first place the woman Bella lied  She must have been crazed
to make that dying statement when I fought as I did for her and Borg
That is the only explanation

Begin at the beginning she interrupted  Remember I know nothing

He settled himself more comfortably on the stool and rolled a
cigarette as he took up the history of the previous night

It must have been about one in the morning when I was awakened by the
lighting of the slushlamp  I thought it was Borg wondered what he
was prowling about for and was on the verge of dropping off to sleep
when though I do not know what prompted me I opened my eyes  Two
strange men were in the cabin  Both wore masks and fur caps with the
flaps pulled down so that I could see nothing of their faces save the
glistening of the eyes through the eyeslits

I had no first thought unless it was that danger threatened  I lay
quietly for a second and deliberated  Borg had borrowed my pistol and
I was actually unarmed  My rifle was by the door  I decided to make a
rush for it  But no sooner had I struck the floor than one of the men
turned on me at the same time firing his revolver  That was the first
shot and the one La Flitche did not hear  It was in the struggle
afterwards that the door was burst open which enabled him to hear the
last three

Well I was so close to the man and my leap out of the bunk was so
unexpected that he missed me  The next moment we grappled and rolled
on the floor  Of course Borg was aroused and the second man turned
his attention to him and Bella  It was this second man who did the
killing for my man naturally had his hands full  You heard the
testimony  From the way the cabin was wrecked you can picture the
struggle  We rolled and tossed about and fought till stools table
shelveseverything was smashed

Oh Frona it was terrible  Borg fighting for life Bella helping
him though wounded and groaning and I unable to aid  But finally in
a very short while I began to conquer the man with whom I was
struggling  I had got him down on his back pinioned his arms with my
knees and was slowly throttling him when the other man finished his
work and turned on me also  What could I do  Two to one and winded
So I was thrown into the corner and they made their escape  I confess
that I must have been badly rattled by that time for as soon as I
caught my breath I took out after them and without a weapon  Then I
collided with La Flitche and John andand you know the rest  Only
he knit his brows in puzzlement only I cannot understand why Bella
should accuse me

He looked at her appealingly and though she pressed his hand
sympathetically she remained silent weighing pro and con what she had
heard

She shook her head slowly  Its a bad case and the thing is to
convince them

But my God Frona I am innocent  I have not been a saint perhaps
but my hands are clean from blood

But remember Gregory she said gently I am not to judge you
Unhappily it rests with the men of this miners meeting and the
problem is how are they to be convinced of your innocence  The two
main points are against youBellas dying words and the blood on your
sleeve

The place was areek with blood St Vincent cried passionately
springing to his feet  I tell you it was areek  How could I avoid
floundering in it fighting as I was for life  Can you not take my
word

There there Gregory  Sit down  You are truly beside yourself  If
your case rested with me you know you would go free and clean  But
these menyou know what mob rule ishow are we to persuade them to
let you go  Dont you see  You have no witnesses  A dying womans
words are more sacred than a living mans  Can you show cause for the
woman to die with a lie on her lips  Had she any reason to hate you
Had you done her or her husband an injury

He shook his head

Certainly to us the thing is inexplicable but the miners need no
explanation  To them it is obvious  It rests with us to disprove the
obvious  Can we do it

The correspondent sank down despondently with a collapsing of the
chest and a drooping forward of the shoulders  Then am I indeed lost

No its not so bad as that  You shall not be hanged  Trust me for
that

But what can you do he asked despairingly  They have usurped the
law have made themselves the law

In the first place the river has broken  That means everything  The
Governor and the territorial judges may be expected in at any moment
with a detachment of police at their backs  And theyre certain to
stop here  And furthermore we may be able to do something ourselves
The river is open and if it comes to the worst escape would be
another way out and escape is the last thing they would dream of

No no impossible  What are you and I against the many

But theres my father and Baron Courbertin  Four determined people
acting together may perform miracles Gregory dear  Trust me it
shall come out well

She kissed him and ran her hand through his hair but the worried look
did not depart

Jacob Welse crossed over the backchannel long before dark and with
him came Del the baron and Corliss  While Frona retired to change
her clothes in one of the smaller cabins which the masculine owners
readily turned over to her her father saw to the welfare of the
mailcarrier  The despatches were of serious import so serious that
long after Jacob Welse had read and reread them his face was dark and
clouded but he put the anxiety from him when he returned to Frona
St Vincent who was confined in an adjoining cabin was permitted to
see them

It looks bad Jacob Welse said on parting for the night  But rest
assured St Vincent bad or not youll not be stretched up so long as
Ive a hand to play in the rumpus  I am certain you did not kill Borg
and theres my fist on it

A long day Corliss remarked as he walked back with Frona to her
cabin

And a longer tomorrow she answered wearily  And Im so sleepy

Youre a brave little woman and Im proud of you  It was ten
oclock and he looked out through the dim twilight to the ghostly ice
drifting steadily by  And in this trouble he went on depend upon
me in any way

In any way she queried with a catch in her voice

If I were a hero of the melodrama Id say To the death but as Im
not Ill just repeat in any way

You are good to me Vance  I can never repay

Tut tut  I do not put myself on sale  Love is service I believe

She looked at him for a long time but while her face betrayed soft
wonder at heart she was troubled she knew not why and the events of
the day and of all the days since she had known him came fluttering
through her mind

Do you believe in a white friendship she asked at last  For I do
hope that such a bond may hold us always  A bright white friendship
a comradeship as it were  And as she asked she was aware that the
phrase did not quite express what she felt and would desire  And when
he shook his head she experienced a glad little inexplicable thrill

A comradeship he questioned  When you know I love you

Yes she affirmed in a low voice

I am afraid after all that your knowledge of man is very limited
Believe me we are not made of such clay  A comradeship  A coming in
out of the cold to sit by your fire  Good  But a coming in when
another man sits with you by your fire  No  Comradeship would demand
that I delight in your delights and yet do you think for a moment
that I could see you with another mans child in your arms a child
which might have been mine with that other man looking out at me
through the childs eyes laughing at me through its mouth  I say do
you think I could delight in your delights  No no love cannot
shackle itself with white friendships

She put her hand on his arm

Do you think I am wrong he asked bewildered by the strange look in
her face

She was sobbing quietly

You are tired and overwrought  So there goodnight  You must get to
bed

No dont go not yet  And she arrested him  No no I am foolish
As you say I am tired  But listen Vance  There is much to be done
We must plan tomorrows work  Come inside  Father and Baron
Courbertin are together and if the worst comes we four must do big
things

Spectacular Jacob Welse commented when Frona had briefly outlined
the course of action and assigned them their parts  But its very
unexpectedness ought to carry it through

A coup detat was the Barons verdict  Magnificent  Ah  I feel
warm all over at the thought  Hands up I cry thus and very fierce

And if they do not hold up their hands he appealed to Jacob Welse

Then shoot  Never bluff when youre behind a gun Courbertin  Its
held by good authorities to be unhealthy

And you are to take charge of La Bijou Vance Frona said  Father
thinks there will be little ice tomorrow if it doesnt jam tonight
All youve to do is to have the canoe by the bank just before the door
Of course you wont know what is happening until St Vincent comes
running  Then in with him and away you goDawson  So Ill say
goodnight and goodby now for I may not have the opportunity in the
morning

And keep the lefthand channel till youre past the bend Jacob Welse
counselled him then take the cutoffs to the right and follow the
swiftest water  Now off with you and into your blankets  Its seventy
miles to Dawson and youll have to make it at one clip




CHAPTER XXVIII

Jacob Welse was given due respect when he arose at the convening of the
miners meeting and denounced the proceedings  While such meetings had
performed a legitimate function in the past he contended when there
was no law in the land that time was now beyond recall for law was
now established and it was just law  The Queens government had shown
itself fit to cope with the situation and for them to usurp its powers
was to step backward into the night out of which they had come
Further no lighter word than criminal could characterize such
conduct  And yet further he promised them in set sober terms if
anything serious were the outcome to take an active part in the
prosecution of every one of them  At the conclusion of his speech he
made a motion to hold the prisoner for the territorial court and to
adjourn but was voted down without discussion

Dont you see St Vincent said to Frona there is no hope

But there is  Listen  And she swiftly outlined the plot of the
night before

He followed her in a halfhearted way too crushed to partake of her
enthusiasm  Its madness to attempt it he objected when she had
done

And it looks very much like hanging not to attempt it she answered a
little spiritedly  Surely you will make a fight

Surely he replied hollowly

The first witnesses were two Swedes who told of the washtub incident
when Borg had given way to one of his fits of anger   Trivial as the
incident was in the light of subsequent events it at once became
serious  It opened the way for the imagination into a vast familiar
field  It was not so much what was said as what was left unsaid  Men
born of women the rudest of them knew life well enough to be aware of
its significancea vulgar common happening capable of but one
interpretation  Heads were wagged knowingly in the course of the
testimony and whispered comments went the rounds

Half a dozen witnesses followed in rapid succession all of whom had
closely examined the scene of the crime and gone over the island
carefully and all of whom were agreed that there was not the slightest
trace to be found of the two men mentioned by the prisoner in his
preliminary statement

To Fronas surprise Del Bishop went upon the stand  She knew he
disliked St Vincent but could not imagine any evidence he could
possess which would bear upon the case

Being sworn and age and nationality ascertained Bill Brown asked him
his business

Pocketminer he challenged back sweeping the assemblage with an
aggressive glance

Now it happens that a very small class of men follow pocketing and
that a very large class of men miners too disbelieve utterly in any
such method or obtaining gold

Pocketminer sneered a redshirted patriarchallooking man a man
who had washed his first pan in the Californian diggings in the early
fifties

Yep Del affirmed

Now look here young feller his interlocutor continued dye mean
to tell me you ever struck it in suchfangled way

Yep

Dont believe it with a contemptuous shrug

Del swallowed fast and raised his head with a jerk  Mr Chairman I
rise to make a statement  I wont interfere with the dignity of the
court but I just wish to simply and distinctly state that after the
meetings over Im going to punch the head of every man that gets gay
Understand

Youre out of order the chairman replied rapping the table with the
caulkingmallet

And your head too Del cried turning upon him  Damn poor order
you preserve  Pocketings got nothing to do with this here trial and
why dont you shut such fool questions out  Ill take care of you
afterwards you potwolloper

You will will you The chairman grew red in the face dropped the
mallet and sprang to his feet

Del stepped forward to meet him but Bill Brown sprang in between and
held them apart

Order gentlemen order he begged  This is no time for unseemly
exhibitions  And remember there are ladies present

The two men grunted and subsided and Bill Brown asked Mr Bishop we
understand that you are well acquainted with the prisoner  Will you
please tell the court what you know of his general character

Del broadened into a smile  Well in the first place hes an
extremely quarrelsome disposition

Hold  I wont have it  The prisoner was on his feet trembling with
anger  You shall not swear my life away in such fashion  To bring a
madman whom I have only met once in my life to testify as to my
character

The pocketminer turned to him  So you dont know me eh Gregory St
Vincent

No St  Vincent replied coldly I do not know you my man

Dont you man me Del shouted hotly

But St Vincent ignored him turning to the crowd

I never saw the fellow but once before and then for a few brief
moments in Dawson

Youll remember before Im done Del sneered so hold your hush and
let me say my little say  I come into the country with him way back in


St Vincent regarded him with sudden interest

Yep Mr Gregory St Vincent  I see you begin to recollect  I
sported whiskers and my name was Brown Joe Brown in them days

He grinned vindictively and the correspondent seemed to lose all
interest

Is it true Gregory Frona whispered

I begin to recognize he muttered slowly  I dont know    no
folly  The man must have died

You say in  Mr Bishop Bill Brown prompted

Yep in   He was a newspaperman bound round the world by way of
Alaska and Siberia  Id run away from a whaler at Sitkathat squares
it with Brownand I engaged with him for forty a month and found
Well he quarrelled with me

A snicker beginning from nowhere in particular but passing on from
man to man and swelling in volume greeted this statement  Even Frona
and Del himself were forced to smile and the only sober face was the
prisoners

But he quarrelled with Old Andy at Dyea and with Chief George of the
Chilcoots and the Factor at Pelly and so on down the line  He got us
into no end of trouble and specially womantrouble  He was always
monkeying around

Mr  Chairman I object  Frona stood up her face quite calm and
blood under control  There is no necessity for bringing in the amours
of Mr St Vincent  They have no bearing whatsoever upon the case
and further none of the men of this meeting are clean enough to be
prompted by the right motive in conducting such an inquiry  So I
demand that the prosecution at least confine itself to relevant
testimony

Bill Brown came up smugly complacent and smiling  Mr Chairman we
willingly accede to the request made by the defence  Whatever we have
brought out has been relevant and material  Whatever we intend to
bring out shall be relevant and material  Mr Bishop is our star
witness and his testimony is to the point  It must be taken into
consideration that we nave no direct evidence as to the murder of John
Borg  We can bring no eyewitnesses into court  Whatever we have is
circumstantial  It is incumbent upon us to show cause  To show cause
it is necessary to go into the character of the accused  This we
intend to do  We intend to show his adulterous and lustful nature
which has culminated in a dastardly deed and jeopardized his neck  We
intend to show that the truth is not in him that he is a liar beyond
price that no word he may speak upon the stand need be accepted by a
jury of his peers  We intend to show all this and to weave it
together thread by thread till we have a rope long enough and strong
enough to hang him with before the day is done  So I respectfully
submit Mr Chairman that the witness be allowed to proceed

The chairman decided against Frona and her appeal to the meeting was
voted down  Bill Brown nodded to Del to resume

As I was saying he got us into no end of trouble  Now Ive been
mixed up with water all my lifenever can get away from it it
seemsand the more Im mixed the less I know about it  St Vincent
knew this too and him a clever hand at the paddle yet he left me to
run the Box Canyon alone while he walked around  Result I was turned
over lost half the outfit and all the tobacco and then he put the
blame on me besides  Right after that he got tangled up with the Lake
Le Barge Sticks and both of us came near croaking

And why was that Bill Brown interjected

All along of a pretty squaw that looked too kindly at him  After we
got clear I lectured him on women in general and squaws in particular
and he promised to behave  Then we had a hot time with the Little
Salmons  He was cuter this time and I didnt know for keeps but I
guessed  He said it was the medicine man who got horstile but
nothingll stir up a medicine man quickern women and the facts
pointed that way  When I talked it over with him in a fatherly way he
got wrathy and I had to take him out on the bank and give him a
threshing  Then he got sulky and didnt brighten up till we ran into
the mouth of the Reindeer River where a camp of Siwashes were fishing
salmon  But he had it in for me all the time only I didnt know
itwas ready any time to give me the double cross

Now theres no denying hes got a taking way with women  All he has
to do is to whistle em up like dogs  Most remarkable faculty that
There was the wickedest prettiest squaw among the Reindeers  Never
saw her beat excepting Bella  Well I guess he whistled her up for
he delayed in the camp longer than was necessary  Being partial to
women

That will do Mr Bishop interrupted the chairman who from
profitless watching of Fronas immobile face had turned to her hand
the nervous twitching and clinching of which revealed what her face had
hidden  That will do Mr Bishop  I think we have had enough of
squaws

Pray do not temper the testimony Frona chirruped sweetly  It
seems very important

Do you know what I am going to say next Del demanded hotly of the
chairman  You dont eh  Then shut up  Im running this particular
sideshow

Bill Brown sprang in to avert hostilities but the chairman restrained
himself and Bishop went on

Id been done with the whole shootingmatch squaws and all if you
hadnt broke me off  Well as I said he had it in for me and the
first thing I didnt know hed hit me on the head with a riflestock
bundled the squaw into the canoe and pulled out  You all know what
the Yukon country was in   And there I was without an outfit left
alone a thousand miles from anywhere  I got out all right though
theres no need of telling how and so did he  Youve all heard of his
adventures in Siberia  Well with an impressive pause I happen to
know a thing or two myself

He shoved a hand into the big pocket of his mackinaw jacket and pulled
out a dingy leatherbound volume of venerable appearance

I got this from Pete Whipples old womanWhipple of Eldorado  It
concerns her granduncle or greatgranduncle I dont know which and
if theres anybody here can read Russian why itll go into the
details of that Siberian trip  But as theres no one here that can

Courbertin  He can read it some one called in the crowd

A way was made for the Frenchman forthwith and he was pushed and
shoved protestingly to the front

Savve the lingo Del demanded

Yes but so poorly so miserable Courbertin demurred  It is a long
time  I forget

Go ahead  We wont criticise

No but

Go ahead the chairman commanded

Del thrust the book into his hands opened at the yellow titlepage
Ive been itching to get my paws on some buck like you for months and
months he assured him gleefully  And now Ive got you you cant
shake me Charley  So fire away

Courbertin began hesitatingly The Journal of Father Yakontsk
Comprising an Account in Brief of his Life in the Benedictine Monastery
at Obidorsky and in Full of his Marvellous Adventures in East Siberia
among the Deer Men

The baron looked up for instructions

Tell us when it was printed Del ordered him

In Warsaw 

The pocketminer turned triumphantly to the room  Did you hear that
Just keep track of it   remember

The baron took up the opening paragraph  It was because of
Tamerlane he commenced unconsciously putting his translation into
a construction with which he was already familiar

At his first words Frona turned white and she remained white
throughout the reading  Once she stole a glance at her father and was
glad that he was looking straight before him for she did not feel able
to meet his gaze just them  On the other hand though she knew St
Vincent was eying her narrowly she took no notice of him and all he
could see was a white face devoid of expression

When Tamerlane swept with fire and sword over Eastern Asia
Courbertin read slowly states were disrupted cities overthrown
and tribes scattered likelike stardust  A vast people was hurled
broadcast over the land  Fleeing before the conquerorsno
nobefore the mad lust of the conquerors these refugees swung far
into Siberia circling circling to the north and east and fringing the
rim of the polar basin with a spray of Mongol tribes

Skip a few pages Bill Brown advised and read here and there  We
havent got all night

Courbertin complied  The coast people are Eskimo stock merry of
nature and not offensive  They call themselves the Oukilion or the
Sea Men  From them I bought dogs and food  But they are subject to
the Chow Chuen who live in the interior and are known as the Deer Men
The Chow Chuen are a fierce and savage race  When I left the coast
they fell upon me took from me my goods and made me a slave  He
ran over a few pages  I worked my way to a seat among the head men
but I was no nearer my freedom  My wisdom was of too great value to
them for me to depart    Old PiUne was a great chief and it was
decreed that I should marry his daughter Ilswunga  Ilswunga was a
filthy creature  She would not bathe and her ways were not good   
I did marry Ilswunga but she was a wife to me only in name  Then did
she complain to her father the old PiUne and he was very wroth  And
dissension was sown among the tribes but in the end I became mightier
than ever what of my cunning and resource and Ilswunga made no more
complaint for I taught her games with cards which she might play by
herself and other things

Is that enough Courbertin asked

Yes that will do Bill Brown answered  But one moment  Please
state again the date of publication

 in Warsaw

Hold on baron Del Bishop spoke up  Now that youre on the stand
Ive got a question or so to slap into you  He turned to the
courtroom  Gentlemen youve all heard somewhat of the prisoners
experiences in Siberia  Youve caught on to the remarkable sameness
between them and those published by Father Yakontsk nearly a hundred
years ago  And you have concluded that theres been some wholesale
cribbing somewhere  I propose to show you that its more than
cribbing  The prisoner gave me the shake on the Reindeer River in 
Fall of  he was at St Michaels on his way to Siberia   and 
he was by his talk cutting up antics in Siberia   he come back to
the world working the conqueringhero graft in Frisco  Now lets see
if the Frenchman can make us wise

You were in Japan he asked

Courbertin who had followed the dates made a quick calculation and
could but illy conceal his surprise  He looked appealingly to Frona
but she did not help him  Yes he said finally

And you met the prisoner there

Yes

What year was it

There was a general craning forward to catch the answer

 and it came unwillingly

Now how can that be baron Del asked in a wheedling tone  The
prisoner was in Siberia at that time

Courbertin shrugged his shoulders that it was no concern of his and
came off the stand  An impromptu recess was taken by the courtroom
for several minutes wherein there was much whispering and shaking of
heads

It is all a lie  St Vincent leaned close to Fronas ear but she
did not hear

Appearances are against me but I can explain it all

But she did not move a muscle and he was called to the stand by the
chairman  She turned to her father and the tears rushed up into her
eyes when he rested his hand on hers

Do you care to pull out he asked after a momentary hesitation

She shook her head and St Vincent began to speak  It was the same
story he had told her though told now a little more fully and in
nowise did it conflict with the evidence of La Flitche and John  He
acknowledged the washtub incident caused he explained by an act of
simple courtesy on his part and by John Borgs unreasoning anger  He
acknowledged that Bella had been killed by his own pistol but stated
that the pistol had been borrowed by Borg several days previously and
not returned  Concerning Bellas accusation he could say nothing  He
could not see why she should die with a lie on her lips  He had never
in the slightest way incurred her displeasure so even revenge could
not be advanced  It was inexplicable  As for the testimony of Bishop
he did not care to discuss it  It was a tissue of falsehood cunningly
interwoven with truth  It was true the man had gone into Alaska with
him in  but his version of the things which happened there was
maliciously untrue  Regarding the baron there was a slight mistake in
the dates that was all

In questioning him  Bill Brown brought out one little surprise  From
the prisoners story he had made a hard fight against the two
mysterious men  If Brown asked such were the case how can you
explain away the fact that you came out of the struggle unmarked  On
examination of the body of John Borg many bruises and contusions were
noticeable  How is it if you put up such a stiff fight that you
escaped being battered

St Vincent did not know though he confessed to feeling stiff and sore
all over  And it did not matter anyway  He had killed neither Borg
nor his wife that much he did know

Frona prefaced her argument to the meeting with a pithy discourse on
the sacredness of human life the weaknesses and dangers of
circumstantial evidence and the rights of the accused wherever doubt
arose  Then she plunged into the evidence stripping off the
superfluous and striving to confine herself to facts  In the first
place she denied that a motive for the deed had been shown  As it
was the introduction of such evidence was an insult to their
intelligence and she had sufficient faith in their manhood and
perspicacity to know that such puerility would not sway them in the
verdict they were to give

And on the other hand in dealing with the particular points at issue
she denied that any intimacy had been shown to have existed between
Bella and St Vincent and she denied further that it had been shown
that any intimacy had been attempted on the part of St Vincent
Viewed honestly the washtub incidentthe only evidence brought
forwardwas a laughable little affair portraying how the simple
courtesy of a gentleman might be misunderstood by a mad boor of a
husband  She left it to their common sense they were not fools

They had striven to prove the prisoner badtempered  She did not need
to prove anything of the sort concerning John Borg  They all knew his
terrible fits of anger they all knew that his temper was proverbial in
the community that it had prevented him having friends and had made
him many enemies  Was it not very probable therefore that the masked
men were two such enemies  As to what particular motive actuated these
two men she could not say but it rested with them the judges to
know whether in all Alaska there were or were not two men whom John
Borg could have given cause sufficient for them to take his life

Witness had testified that no traces had been found of these two men
but the witness had not testified that no traces had been found of St
Vincent Pierre La Flitche or John the Swede  And there was no need
for them so to testify  Everybody knew that no footmarks were left
when St Vincent ran up the trail and when he came back with La
Flitche and the other man  Everybody knew the condition of the trail
that it was a hardpacked groove in the ground on which a soft
moccasin could leave no impression and that had the ice not gone down
the river no traces would have been left by the murderers in passing
from and to the mainland

At this juncture La Flitche nodded his head in approbation and she
went on

Capital had been made out of the blood on St Vincents hands  If they
chose to examine the moccasins at that moment on the feet of Mr La
Flitche they would also find blood  That did not argue that Mr La
Flitche had been a party to the shedding of the blood

Mr Brown had drawn attention to the fact that the prisoner had not
been bruised or marked in the savage encounter which had taken place
She thanked him for having done so  John Borgs body showed that it
had been roughly used  He was a larger stronger heavier man than St
Vincent  If as charged St Vincent had committed the murder and
necessarily therefore engaged in a struggle severe enough to bruise
John Borg how was it that he had come out unharmed  That was a point
worthy of consideration

Another one was why did he run down the trail  It was inconceivable
if he had committed the murder that he should without dressing or
preparation for escape run towards the other cabins  It was however
easily conceivable that he should take up the pursuit of the real
murderers and in the darknessexhausted breathless and certainly
somewhat excitedrun blindly down the trail

Her summing up was a strong piece of synthesis and when she had done
the meeting applauded her roundly  But she was angry and hurt for she
knew the demonstration was for her sex rather than for her cause and
the work she had done

Bill Brown somewhat of a shyster and his ear ever cocked to the
crowd was not above taking advantage when opportunity offered and
when it did not offer to dogmatize artfully  In this his native humor
was a strong factor and when he had finished with the mysterious
masked men they were as exploded sunmythswhich phrase he promptly
applied to them

They could not have got off the island  The condition of the ice for
the three or four hours preceding the breakup would not have permitted
it  The prisoner had implicated none of the residents of the island
while every one of them with the exception of the prisoner had been
accounted for elsewhere  Possibly the prisoner was excited when he ran
down the trail into the arms of La Flitche and John the Swede  One
should have thought however that he had grown used to such things in
Siberia  But that was immaterial the facts were that he was
undoubtedly in an abnormal state of excitement that he was
hysterically excited and that a murderer under such circumstances
would take little account of where he ran  Such things had happened
before  Many a man had butted into his own retribution

In the matter of the relations of Borg Bella and St Vincent he made
a strong appeal to the instinctive prejudices of his listeners and for
the time being abandoned matteroffact reasoning for allpotent
sentimental platitudes  He granted that circumstantial evidence never
proved anything absolutely  It was not necessary it should  Beyond
the shadow of a reasonable doubt was all that was required  That this
had been done he went on to review the testimony

And finally he said you cant get around Bellas last words  We
know nothing of our own direct knowledge  Weve been feeling around in
the dark clutching at little things and trying to figure it all out
But gentlemen he paused to search the faces of his listeners Bella
knew the truth  Hers is no circumstantial evidence  With quick
anguished breath and lifeblood ebbing from her and eyeballs glazing
she spoke the truth  With dark night coming on and the deathrattle
in her throat she raised herself weakly and pointed a shaking finger
at the accused thus and she said Him him him  St Vincha him do
it

With Bill Browns finger still boring into him St Vincent struggled
to his feet  His face looked old and gray and he looked about him
speechlessly  Funk  Funk was whispered back and forth and not so
softly but what he heard  He moistened his lips repeatedly and his
tongue fought for articulation  It is as I have said he succeeded
finally  I did not do it  Before God I did not do it  He stared
fixedly at John the Swede waiting the while on his laggard thought
I     I did not do it     I did not     I     I did not

He seemed to have become lost in some supreme meditation wherein John
the Swede figured largely and as Frona caught him by the hand and
pulled him gently down some man cried out Secret ballot

But Bill Brown was on his feet at once  No  I say no  An open
ballot  We are men and as men are not afraid to put ourselves on
record

A chorus of approval greeted him and the open ballot began  Man after
man called upon by name spoke the one word Guilty

Baron Courbertin came forward and whispered to Frona  She nodded her
head and smiled and he edged his way back taking up a position by the
door  He voted Not guilty when his turn came as did Frona and Jacob
Welse  Pierre La Flitche wavered a moment looking keenly at Frona and
St Vincent then spoke up clear and flutelike Guilty

As the chairman arose Jacob Welse casually walked over to the opposite
side of the table and stood with his back to the stove  Courbertin
who had missed nothing pulled a picklekeg out from the wall and
stepped upon it

The chairman cleared his throat and rapped for order  Gentlemen he
announced the prisoner

Hands up Jacob Welse commanded peremptorily and a fraction of a
second after him came the shrill Hands up gentlemen of Courbertin

Front and rear they commanded the crowd with their revolvers  Every
hand was in the air the chairmans having gone up still grasping the
mallet  There was no disturbance  Each stood or sat in the same
posture as when the command went forth  Their eyes playing here and
there among the central figures always returned to Jacob Welse

St Vincent sat as one dumfounded  Frona thrust a revolver into his
hand but his limp fingers refused to close on it

Come Gregory she entreated  Quick  Corliss is waiting with the
canoe  Come

She shook him and he managed to grip the weapon  Then she pulled and
tugged as when awakening a heavy sleeper till he was on his feet
But his face was livid his eyes like a somnambulists and he was
afflicted as with a palsy  Still holding him she took a step backward
for him to come on  He ventured it with a shaking knee  There was no
sound save the heavy breathing of many men  A man coughed slightly and
cleared his throat  It was disquieting and all eyes centred upon him
rebukingly  The man became embarrassed and shifted his weight
uneasily to the other leg  Then the heavy breathing settled down again

St Vincent took another step but his fingers relaxed and the revolver
fell with a loud noise to the floor  He made no effort to recover it
Frona stooped hurriedly but Pierre La Flitche had set his foot upon
it  She looked up and saw his hands above his head and his eyes fixed
absently on Jacob Welse  She pushed at his leg and the muscles were
tense and hard giving the lie to the indifference on his face  St
Vincent looked down helplessly as though he could not understand

But this delay drew the attention of Jacob Welse and as he tried to
make out the cause the chairman found his chance  Without crooking
his right arm swept out and down the heavy caulkingmallet leaping
from his hand  It spanned the short distance and smote Jacob Welse
below the ear  His revolver went off as he fell and John the Swede
grunted and clapped a hand to his thigh

Simultaneous with this the baron was overcome  Del Bishop with hands
still above his head and eyes fixed innocently before him had simply
kicked the picklekeg out from under the Frenchman and brought him to
the floor  His bullet however sped harmlessly through the roof  La
Flitche seized Frona in his arms  St Vincent suddenly awakening
sprang for the door but was tripped up by the breeds ready foot

The chairman pounded the table with his fist and concluded his broken
sentence Gentlemen the prisoner is found guilty as charged




CHAPTER XXIX

Frona had gone at once to her fathers side but he was already
recovering  Courbertin was brought forward with a scratched face
sprained wrist and an insubordinate tongue  To prevent discussion and
to save time Bill Brown claimed the floor

Mr Chairman while we condemn the attempt on the part of Jacob Welse
Frona Welse and Baron Courbertin to rescue the prisoner and thwart
justice we cannot under the circumstances but sympathize with them
There is no need that I should go further into this matter  You all
know and doubtless under a like situation would have done the same
And so in order that we may expeditiously finish the business I make
a motion to disarm the three prisoners and let them go

The motion was carried and the two men searched for weapons  Frona
was saved this by giving her word that she was no longer armed  The
meeting then resolved itself into a hanging committee and began to
file out of the cabin

Sorry I had to do it the chairman said halfapologetically
halfdefiantly

Jacob Welse smiled  You took your chance he answered and I cant
blame you  I only wish Id got you though

Excited voices arose from across the cabin  Here you  Leggo Step
on his fingers Tim  Break that grip  Ouch  Ow  Pry his mouth
open

Frona saw a knot of struggling men about St Vincent and ran over  He
had thrown himself down on the floor and tooth and nail was fighting
like a madman  Tim Dugan a stalwart Celt had come to close quarters
with him and St Vincents teeth were sunk in the mans arm

Smash m Tim  Smash m

How can I ye fule  Get a pry on his mouth will ye

One moment please  The men made way for her drawing back and
leaving St Vincent and Tim

Frona knelt down by him  Leave go Gregory  Do leave go

He looked up at her and his eyes did not seem human  He breathed
stertorously and in his throat were the queer little gasping noises of
one overwrought

It is I Gregory  She brushed her hand soothingly across his brow
Dont you understand  It is I Frona  Do leave go

His whole body slowly relaxed and a peaceful expression grew upon his
face  His jaw dropped and the mans arm was withdrawn

Now listen Gregory  Though you are to die

But I cannot  I cannot he groaned  You said that I could trust to
you that all would come well

She thought of the chance which had been given but said nothing

Oh Frona  Frona He sobbed and buried his face in her lap

At least you can be a man  It is all that remains

Come on Tim Dugan commanded  Sorry to bother ye miss but weve
got to fetch m along  Drag m out you fellys  Catch m by the legs
Blackey and you too Johnson

St Vincents body stiffened at the words the rational gleam went out
of his eyes and his fingers closed spasmodically on Fronas  She
looked entreaty at the men and they hesitated

Give me a minute with him she begged just a minute

He aint worth it Dugan sneered after they had drawn apart  Look
at m

Its a damned shame corroborated Blackey squinting sidewise at
Frona whispering in St Vincents ear the while her hand wandered
caressingly through his hair

What she said they did not hear but she got him on his feet and led
him forward  He walked as a dead man might walk and when he entered
the open air gazed forth wonderingly upon the muddy sweep of the Yukon
The crowd had formed by the bank about a pine tree  A boy engaged in
running a rope over one of the branches finished his task and slid
down the trunk to the ground  He looked quickly at the palms of his
hands and blew upon them and a laugh went up  A couple of wolfdogs
on the outskirts bristled up to each other and bared their fangs  Men
encouraged them  They closed in and rolled over but were kicked aside
to make room for St Vincent

Corliss came up the bank to Frona  Whats up he whispered  Is it
off

She tried to speak but swallowed and nodded her head

This way Gregory  She touched his arm and guided him to the box
beneath the rope

Corliss keeping step with them looked over the crowd speculatively
and felt into his jacketpocket  Can I do anything he asked
gnawing his under lip impatiently  Whatever you say goes Frona  I
can stand them off

She looked at him aware of pleasure in the sight  She knew he would
dare it but she knew also that it would be unfair  St Vincent had
had his chance and it was not right that further sacrifice should be
made  No Vance  It is too late  Nothing can be done

At least let me try he persisted

No it is not our fault that our plan failed and    and    Her
eyes filled  Please do not ask it of me

Then let me take you away  You cannot remain here

I must she answered simply and turned to St Vincent who seemed
dreaming

Blackey was tying the hangmans knot in the ropes end preparatory to
slipping the noose over St Vincents head

Kiss me Gregory she said her hand on his arm

He started at the touch and saw all eager eyes centred upon him and
the yellow noose just shaped in the hands of the hangman  He threw
up his arms as though to ward it off and cried loudly No no  Let
me confess  Let me tell the truth then youll believe me

Bill Brown and the chairman shoved Blackey back and the crowd gathered
in  Cries and protestations rose from its midst  No you dont a
boys shrill voice made itself heard  Im not going to go  I climbed
the tree and made the rope fast and Ive got a right to stay
Youre only a kid replied a mans voice and it aint good for
you  I dont care and Im not a kid  ImIm used to such things
And anyway I climbed the tree  Look at my hands  Of course he can
stay other voices took up the trouble  Leave him alone Curley
You aint the whole thing  A laugh greeted this and things quieted
down

Silence the chairman called and then to St Vincent Go ahead
you and dont take all day about it

Give us a chance to hear the crowd broke out again  Put m on the
box  Put m on the box

St Vincent was helped up and began with eager volubility

I didnt do it but I saw it done  There werent two menonly one
He did it and Bella helped him

A wave of laughter drowned him out

Not so fast Bill Brown cautioned him  Kindly explain how Bella
helped this man kill herself  Begin at the beginning

That night before he turned in Borg set his burglar alarm

Burglar alarm

Thats what I called ita tin breadpan attached to the latch so the
door couldnt open without tumbling it down  He set it every night as
though he were afraid of what might happenthe very thing which did
happen for that matter  On the night of the murder I awoke with the
feeling that some one was moving around  The slushlamp was burning
low and I saw Bella at the door  Borg was snoring I could hear him
plainly  Bella was taking down the breadpan and she exercised great
care about it  Then she opened the door and an Indian came in softly
He had no mask and I should know him if ever I see him again for a
scar ran along the forehead and down over one eye

I suppose you sprang out of bed and gave the alarm

No I didnt St Vincent answered with a defiant toss of the head
as though he might as well get the worst over with  I just lay there
and waited

What did you think

That Bella was in collusion with the Indian and that Borg was to be
murdered  It came to me at once

And you did nothing

Nothing  His voice sank and his eyes dropped to Frona leaning
against the box beneath him and steadying it  She did not seem to be
affected  Bella came over to me but I closed my eyes and breathed
regularly  She held the slushlamp to me but I played sleep naturally
enough to fool her  Then I heard a snort of sudden awakening and
alarm and a cry and I looked out  The Indian was hacking at Borg
with a knife and Borg was warding off with his arms and trying to
grapple him  When they did grapple Bella crept up from behind and
threw her arm in a stranglehold about her husbands neck  She put her
knee into the small of his back and bent him backward and with the
Indian helping threw him to the floor

And what did you do

I watched

Had you a revolver

Yes

The one you previously said John Borg had borrowed

Yes but I watched

Did John Borg call for help

Yes

Can you give his words

He called St Vincent  Oh St Vincent  Oh my God  Oh St
Vincent help me  He shuddered at the recollection and added It
was terrible

I should say so Brown grunted  And you

I watched was the dogged reply while a groan went up from the
crowd  Borg shook clear of them however and got on his legs  He
hurled Bella across the cabin with a backsweep of the arm and turned
upon the Indian  Then they fought  The Indian had dropped the knife
and the sound of Borgs blows was sickening  I thought he would surely
beat the Indian to death  That was when the furniture was smashed
They rolled and snarled and struggled like wild beasts  I wondered the
Indians chest did not cave in under some of Borgs blows  But Bella
got the knife and stabbed her husband repeatedly about the body  The
Indian had clinched with him and his arms were not free so he kicked
out at her sideways  He must have broken her legs for she cried out
and fell down and though she tried she never stood up again  Then he
went down with the Indian under him across the stove

Did he call any more for help

He begged me to come to him

And

I watched  He managed to get clear of the Indian and staggered over
to me  He was streaming blood and I could see he was very weak
Give me your gun he said quick give me it  He felt around
blindly  Then his mind seemed to clear a bit and he reached across me
to the holster hanging on the wall and took the pistol  The Indian
came at him with the knife again but he did not try to defend himself
Instead he went on towards Bella with the Indian still hanging to him
and hacking at him  The Indian seemed to bother and irritate him and
he shoved him away  He knelt down and turned Bellas face up to the
light but his own face was covered with blood and he could not see
So he stopped long enough to brush the blood from his eyes  He
appeared to look in order to make sure  Then he put the revolver to
her breast and fired

The Indian went wild at this and rushed at him with the knife at the
same time knocking the pistol out of his hand  It was then the shelf
with the slushlamp was knocked down  They continued to fight in the
darkness and there were more shots fired though I do not know by
whom  I crawled out of the bunk but they struck against me in their
struggles and I fell over Bella  Thats when the blood got on my
hands  As I ran out the door more shots were fired  Then I met La
Flitche and John and    and you know the rest  This is the truth I
have told you I swear it

He looked down at Frona  She was steadying the box and her face was
composed  He looked out over the crowd and saw unbelief  Many were
laughing

Why did you not tell this story at first Bill Brown demanded

Because    because   

Well

Because I might have helped

There was more laughter at this and Bill Brown turned away from him
Gentlemen you have heard this pipe dream  It is a wilder fairy story
than his first  At the beginning of the trial we promised to show that
the truth was not in him  That we succeeded your verdict is ample
testimony  But that he should likewise succeed and more brilliantly
we did not expect  That he has you cannot doubt  What do you think
of him  Lie upon lie he has given us he has been proven a chronic
liar are you to believe this last and fearfully impossible lie
Gentlemen I can only ask that you reaffirm your judgment  And to
those who may doubt his mendacitysurely there are but fewlet me
state that if his story is true if he broke salt with this man John
Borg and lay in his blankets while murder was done if he did hear
unmoved the voice of the man calling to him for help if he did lie
there and watch that carnival of butchery without his manhood prompting
himlet me state gentlemen I say let me state that he is none the
less deserveful of hanging  We cannot make a mistake  What shall it
be

Death  String him up  Stretch m were the cries

But the crowd suddenly turned its attention to the river and even
Blackey refrained from his official task  A large raft worked by a
sweep at either end was slipping past the tail of Splitup Island
close to the shore  When it was at their feet its nose was slewed
into the bank and while its free end swung into the stream to make the
consequent circle a snubbingrope was flung ashore and several turns
taken about the tree under which St Vincent stood  A cargo of
moosemeat red and raw cut into quarters peeped from beneath a cool
covering of spruce boughs  And because of this the two men on the
raft looked up to those on the bank with pride in their eyes

Tryin to make Dawson with it one of them explained and the suns
allfired hot

Nope said his comrade in reply to a query dont care to stop and
trade  Its worth a dollar and a half a pound down below and were
hustlin to get there  But weve got some pieces of a man we want to
leave with you  He turned and pointed to a loose heap of blankets
which slightly disclosed the form of a man beneath  We gathered him
in this mornin bout thirty mile up the Stewart I should judge

Stands in need of doctorin the other man spoke up and the meats
spoilin and we aint got time for nothin  Beggar dont have
anythin to say  Dont savve the burro  Looks as he might have been
mixin things with a grizzly or somethinall battered and gouged
Injured internally from the looks of it  Wherell you have him

Frona standing by St Vincent saw the injured man borne over the
crest of the bank and through the crowd  A bronzed hand drooped down
and a bronzed face showed from out the blankets  The bearers halted
near them while a decision could be reached as to where he should be
carried  Frona felt a sudden fierce grip on her arm

Look look  St Vincent was leaning forward and pointing wildly at
the injured man  Look  That scar

The Indian opened his eyes and a grin of recognition distorted his face

It is he  It is he  St Vincent trembling with eagerness turned
upon the crowd  I call you all to witness  That is the man who
killed John Borg

No laughter greeted this for there was a terrible earnestness in his
manner  Bill Brown and the chairman tried to make the Indian talk but
could not  A miner from British Columbia was pressed into service but
his Chinook made no impression  Then La Flitche was called  The
handsome breed bent over the man and talked in gutturals which only his
mothers heredity made possible  It sounded all one yet it was
apparent that he was trying many tongues  But no response did he draw
and he paused disheartened  As though with sudden recollection he
made another attempt  At once a gleam of intelligence shot across the
Indians face and his larynx vibrated to similar sounds

It is the Stick talk of the Upper White La Flitche stopped long
enough to explain

Then with knit brows and stumbling moments when he sought
dimremembered words he plied the man with questions  To the rest it
was like a pantomimethe meaningless grunts and waving arms and
facial expressions of puzzlement surprise and understanding  At
times a passion wrote itself on the face of the Indian and a sympathy
on the face of La Flitche  Again by look and gesture St Vincent was
referred to and once a sober mirthless laugh shaped the mouths of
them

So  It is good La Flitche said when the Indians head dropped
back  This man make true talk  He come from White River way up  He
cannot understand  He surprised very much so many white men  He
never think so many white men in the world  He die soon  His name Gow

Long time ago three year this man John Borg go to this man Gows
country  He hunt he bring plenty meat to the camp wherefore White
River Sticks like him  Gow have one squaw Piskku  Bimeby John Borg
make preparation to go way  He go to Gow and he say Give me your
squaw  We trade  For her I give you many things  But Gow say no
Piskku good squaw  No woman sew moccasin like she  She tan
mooseskin the best and make the softest leather  He like Piskku
Then John Borg say he dont care he want Piskku  Then they have a
skookum big fight and Piskku go way with John Borg  She no want
to go way but she go anyway  Borg call her Bella and give her
plenty good things but she like Gow all the time  La Flitche pointed
to the scar which ran down the forehead and past the eye of the Indian
John Borg he do that

Long time Gow pretty near die  Then he get well but his head sick
He dont know nobody  Dont know his father his mother or anything
Just like a little baby  Just like that  Then one day quick click
something snap and his head get well all at once  He know his father
and mother he remember Piskku he remember everything  His father
say John Borg go down river  Then Gow go down river  Springtime ice
very bad  He very much afraid so many white men and when he come to
this place he travel by night  Nobody see him tall but he see
everybody  He like a cat see in the dark  Somehow he come straight
to John Borgs cabin  He do not know how this was except that the
work he had to do was good work

St Vincent pressed Fronas hand but she shook her fingers clear and
withdrew a step

He see Piskku feed the dogs and he have talk with her  That night
he come and she open the door  Then you know that which was done  St
Vincent do nothing Borg kill Bella  Gow kill Borg  Borg kill Gow
for Gow die pretty quick  Borg have strong arm  Gow sick inside all
smashed up  Gow no care Piskku dead

After that he go cross ice to the land  I tell him all you people
say it cannot be no man can cross the ice at that time  He laugh and
say that it is and what is must be  Anyway he have very hard time
but he get cross all right  He very sick inside  Bimeby he cannot
walk he crawl  Long time he come to Stewart River  Can go no more
so he lay down to die  Two white men find him and bring him to this
place  He dont care  He die anyway

La Flitche finished abruptly but nobody spoke  Then he added I
think Gow damn good man

Frona came up to Jacob Welse  Take me away father she said  I am
so tired




CHAPTER XXX

Next morning Jacob Welse for all of the Company and his millions in
mines chopped up the days supply of firewood lighted a cigar and
went down the island in search of Baron Courbertin  Frona finished the
breakfast dishes hung out the robes to air and fed the dogs  Then
she took a worn Wordsworth from her clothesbag and out by the bank
settled herself comfortably in a seat formed by two uprooted pines
But she did no more than open the book for her eyes strayed out and
over the Yukon to the eddy below the bluffs and the bend above and
the tail of the spit which lay in the midst of the river  The rescue
and the race were still fresh with her though there were strange
lapses here and there of which she remembered little  The struggle
by the fissure was immeasurable she knew not how long it lasted and
the race down Splitup to Roubeau Island was a thing of which her
reason convinced her but of which she recollected nothing

The whim seized her and she followed Corliss through the three days
events but she tacitly avoided the figure of another man whom she
would not name  Something terrible was connected therewith she knew
which must be faced sooner or later but she preferred to put that
moment away from her  She was stiff and sore of mind as well as of
body and will and action were for the time being distasteful  It was
more pleasant even to dwell on Tommy on Tommy of the bitter tongue
and craven heart and she made a note that the wife and children in
Toronto should not be forgotten when the Northland paid its dividends
to the Welse

The crackle of a foot on a dead willowtwig roused her and her eyes
met St Vincents

You have not congratulated me upon my escape he began breezily
But you must have been deadtired last night  I know I was  And you
had that hard pull on the river besides

He watched her furtively trying to catch some cue as to her attitude
and mood

Youre a heroine thats what you are Frona he began again with
exuberance  And not only did you save the mailman but by the delay
you wrought in the trial you saved me  If one more witness had gone on
the stand that first day I should have been duly hanged before Gow put
in an appearance  Fine chap Gow  Too bad hes going to die

I am glad that I could be of help she replied wondering the while
what she could say

And of course I am to be congratulated

Your trial is hardly a thing for congratulation she spoke up
quickly looking him straight in the eyes for the moment  I am glad
that it came out as it did but surely you cannot expect me to
congratulate you

Ooo with longdrawn inflection  So thats where it pinches  He
smiled goodhumoredly and moved as though to sit down but she made no
room for him and he remained standing  I can certainly explain  If
there have been women

Frona had been clinching her hand nervously but at the word burst out
in laughter

Women she queried  Women she repeated  Do not be ridiculous
Gregory

After the way you stood by me through the trial he began
reproachfully I thought

Oh you do not understand she said hopelessly  You do not
understand  Look at me Gregory and see if I can make you understand
Your presence is painful to me  Your kisses hurt me  The memory of
them still burns my cheek and my lips feel unclean  And why  Because
of women which you may explain away  How little do you understand
But shall I tell you

Voices of men came to her from down the riverbank and the splashing
of water  She glanced quickly and saw Del Bishop guiding a polingboat
against the current and Corliss on the bank bending to the towrope

Shall I tell you why Gregory St Vincent she said again  Tell you
why your kisses have cheapened me  Because you broke the faith of food
and blanket  Because you broke salt with a man and then watched that
man fight unequally for life without lifting your hand  Why I had
rather you had died in defending him the memory of you would have been
good  Yes I had rather you had killed him yourself  At least it
would have shown there was blood in your body

So this is what you would call love he began scornfully his
fretting fuming devil beginning to rouse  A fairweather love
truly  But Lord how we men learn

I had thought you were well lessoned she retorted what of the
other women

But what do you intend to do he demanded taking no notice  I am
not an easy man to cross  You cannot throw me over with impunity  I
shall not stand for it I warn you  You have dared do things in this
country which would blacken you were they known  I have ears  I have
not been asleep  You will find it no childs play to explain away
things which you may declare most innocent

She looked at him with a smile which carried pity in its cold mirth
and it goaded him

I am down a thing to make a jest upon a thing to pity but I promise
you that I can drag you with me  My kisses have cheapened you eh
Then how must you have felt at Happy Camp on the Dyea Trail

As though in answer Corliss swung down upon them with the towrope

Frona beckoned a greeting to him  Vance she said the mailcarrier
has brought important news to father so important that he must go
outside  He starts this afternoon with Baron Courbertin in La Bijou
Will you take me down to Dawson  I should like to go at once today

He    he suggested you she added shyly indicating St Vincent
