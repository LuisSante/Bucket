A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES




As Easy as ABC



The ABC that semielected seminominated body of a few score
persons controls the Planet Transportation is Civilisation our motto
runs Theoretically we do what we please so long as we do not interfere
with the traffic and all it implies Practically the ABC confirms
or annuls all international arrangements and to judge from its last
report finds our tolerant humorous lazy little Planet only too ready
to shift the whole burden of public administration on its shoulders

With the Night Mail

Footnote  Actions and Reactions

Isnt it almost time that our Planet took some interest in the
proceedings of the Arial Board of Control One knows that easy
communications nowadays and lack of privacy in the past have killed
all curiosity among mankind but as the Boards Official Reporter I am
bound to tell my tale

At  AM August  AD  the Board sitting in London was
informed by De Forest that the District of Northern Illinois had
riotously cut itself out of all systems and would remain disconnected
till the Board should take over and administer it direct

Every Northern Illinois freight and passenger tower was he reported
out of action all District main local and guiding lights had been
extinguished all General Communications were dumb and through traffic
had been diverted No reason had been given but he gathered
unofficially from the Mayor of Chicago that the District complained of
crowdmaking and invasion of privacy

As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Northern Illinois
stay in or out of planetary circuit as a matter of policy any
complaint of invasion of privacy needs immediate investigation lest
worse follow

By  AM De Forest Dragomiroff Russia Takahira Japan and
Pirolo Italy were empowered to visit Illinois and to take such steps
as might be necessary for the resumption of traffic and all that that
implies By  AM the Hall was empty and the four Members and I
were aboard what Pirolo insisted on calling my leetle godchildthat
is to say the new Victor Pirolo Our Planet prefers to know Victor
Pirolo as a gentle greyhaired enthusiast who spends his time near
Foggia inventing or creating new breeds of SpanishItalian olivetrees
but there is another side to his naturethe manufacture of quaint
inventions of which the Victor Pirolo is perhaps not the least
surprising She and a few score sistercraft of the same type embody his
latest ideas But she is not comfortable An ABC boat does not take
the air with the levelkeeled lift of a liner but shoots up
rocketfashion like the aeroplane of our ancestors and makes her
height at topspeed from the first That is why I found myself sitting
suddenly on the large lap of Eustace Arnott who commands the ABC
Fleet One knows vaguely that there is such a thing as a Fleet somewhere
on the Planet and that theoretically it exists for the purposes of
what used to be known as war Only a week before while visiting a
glacier sanatorium behind Gothaven I had seen some squadrons making
false auroras far to the north while they manoeuvred round the Pole
but naturally it had never occurred to me that the things could be
used in earnest

Said Arnott to De Forest as I staggered to a seat on the chartroom
divan Were tremendously grateful to em in Illinois Weve never had
a chance of exercising all the Fleet together Ive turned in a General
Call and I expect well have at least two hundred keels aloft
this evening

Well aloft De Forest asked

Of course sir Out of sight till theyre called for

Arnott laughed as he lolled over the transparent charttable where the
map of the summerblue Atlantic slid along degree by degree in exact
answer to our progress Our dial already showed  mph and we were
two thousand feet above the uppermost traffic lines

Now where is this Illinois District of yours said Dragomiroff One
travels so much one sees so little Oh I remember It is in
North America

De Forest whose business it is to know the out districts told us that
it lay at the foot of Lake Michigan on a road to nowhere in particular
was about half an hours run from end to end and except in one corner
as flat as the sea Like most flat countries nowadays it was heavily
guarded against invasion of privacy by forced timberfiftyfoot spruce
and tamarack grown in five years The population was close on two
millions largely migratory between Florida and California with a
backbone of small farms they call a thousand acres a farm in Illinois
whose owners come into Chicago for amusements and society during the
winter They were he said noticeably kind quiet folk but a little
exacting as all flat countries must be in their notions of privacy
There had for instance been no printed newssheet in Illinois for
twentyseven years Chicago argued that engines for printed news sooner
or later developed into engines for invasion of privacy which in turn
might bring the old terror of Crowds and blackmail back to the Planet
So newssheets were not

And thats Illinois De Forest concluded You see in the Old Days
she was in the forefront of what they used to call progress and
Chicago

Chicago said Takahira Thats the little place where there is
Salatis Statue of the Nigger in Flames A fine bit of old work

When did you see it asked De Forest quickly They only unveil it
once a year

I know At Thanksgiving It was then said Takahira with a shudder
And they sang MacDonoughs Song too

Whew De Forest whistled I did not know that I wish youd told me
before MacDonoughs Song may have had its uses when it was composed
but it was an infernal legacy for any man to leave behind

Its protective instinct my dear fellows said Pirolo rolling a
cigarette The Planet she has had her dose of popular government She
suffers from inherited agoraphobia She has noahuse for Crowds

Dragomiroff leaned forward to give him a light Certainly said the
whitebearded Russian the Planet has taken all precautions against
Crowds for the past hundred years What is our total population today
Six hundred million we hope five hundred we think butbut if next
years census shows more than four hundred and fifty I myself will eat
all the extra little babies We have cut the birthrate outright out
For a long time we have said to Almighty God Thank You Sir but we do
not much like Your game of life so we will not play

Anyhow said Arnott defiantly men live a century apiece on the
average now

Oh that is quite well I am richyou are richwe are all rich and
happy because we are so few and we live so long Only I think Almighty
God He will remember what the Planet was like in the time of Crowds and
the Plague Perhaps He will send us nerves Eh Pirolo

The Italian blinked into space Perhaps he said He has sent them
already Anyhow you cannot argue with the Planet She does not forget
the Old Days andwhat can you do

For sure we cant remake the world De Forest glanced at the map
flowing smoothly across the table from west to east We ought to be
over our ground by nine tonight There wont be much sleep afterwards

On which hint we dispersed and I slept till Takahira waked me for
dinner Our ancestors thought nine hours sleep ample for their little
lives We living thirty years longer feel ourselves defrauded with
less than eleven out of the twentyfour

By ten oclock we were over Lake Michigan The west shore was lightless
except for a dull groundglare at Chicago and a single
trafficdirecting lightits leading beam pointing northat Waukegan on
our starboard bow None of the Lake villages gave any sign of life and
inland westward so far as we could see blackness lay unbroken on the
level earth We swooped down and skimmed low across the dark throwing
calls county by county Now and again we picked up the faint glimmer of
a houselight or heard the rasp and rend of a cultivator being played
across the fields but Northern Illinois as a whole was one inky
apparently uninhabited waste of high forced woods Only our
illuminated map with its little pointer switching from county to county
as we wheeled and twisted gave us any idea of our position Our calls
urgent pleading coaxing or commanding through the General
Communicator brought no answer Illinois strictly maintained her own
privacy in the timber which she grew for that purpose

Oh this is absurd said De Forest Were like an owl trying to work
a wheatfield Is this Bureau Creek Lets land Arnott and get hold of
some one

We brushed over a belt of forced woodlandfifteenyearold maple sixty
feet highgrounded on a private meadowdock none too big where we
moored to our own grapnels and hurried out through the warm dark night
towards a light in a verandah As we neared the garden gate I could have
sworn we had stepped kneedeep in quicksand for we could scarcely drag
our feet against the prickling currents that clogged them After five
paces we stopped wiping our foreheads as hopelessly stuck on dry
smooth turf as so many cows in a bog

Pest cried Pirolo angrily We are groundcircuited And it is my own
system of groundcircuits too I know the pull

Good evening said a girls voice from the verandah Oh Im sorry
Weve locked up Wait a minute

We heard the click of a switch and almost fell forward as the currents
round our knees were withdrawn

The girl laughed and laid aside her knitting An oldfashioned
Controller stood at her elbow which she reversed from time to time and
we could hear the snort and clank of the obedient cultivator half a mile
away behind the guardian woods

Come in and sit down she said Im only playing a plough Dads
gone to Chicago toAh Then it was your call I heard just now

She had caught sight of Arnotts Board uniform leaped to the switch
and turned it full on

We were checked gasping waistdeep in current this time three yards
from the verandah

We only want to know whats the matter with Illinois said De Forest
placidly

Then hadnt you better go to Chicago and find out she answered
Theres nothing wrong here We own ourselves

How can we go anywhere if you wont loose us De Forest went on while
Arnott scowled Admirals of Fleets are still quite human when their
dignity is touched

Stop a minuteyou dont know how funny you look She put her hands on
her hips and laughed mercilessly

Dont worry about that said Arnott and whistled A voice answered
from the Victor Pirolo in the meadow

Only a singlefuse groundcircuit Arnott called Sort it out gently
please

We heard the ping of a breaking lamp a fuse blew out somewhere in the
verandah roof frightening a nestful of birds The groundcircuit was
open We stooped and rubbed our tingling ankles

How rudehow very rude of you the maiden cried

Sorry but we havent time to look funny said Arnott Weve got to
go to Chicago and if I were you young lady Id go into the cellars
for the next two hours and take mother with me

Off he strode with us at his heels muttering indignantly till the
humour of the thing struck and doubled him up with laughter at the foot
of the gangway ladder

The Board hasnt shown what you might call a fat spark on this
occasion said De Forest wiping his eyes I hope I didnt look as big
a fool as you did Arnott Hullo What on earth is that Dad coming home
from Chicago

There was a rattle and a rush and a fiveplough cultivator blades in
air like so many teeth trundled itself at us round the edge of the
timber fuming and sparking furiously

Jump said Arnott as we bundled ourselves through the nonetoowide
door Never mind about shutting it Up

The Victor Pirolo lifted like a bubble and the vicious machine shot
just underneath us clawing high as it passed

Theres a nice little spitkitten for you said Arnott dusting his
knees We ask her a civil question First she circuits us and then she
plays a cultivator at us

And then we fly said Dragomiroff If I were forty years more young
I would go back and kiss her Ho Ho

I said Pirolo would smack her My pet ship has been chased by a
dirty plough ahow do you sayagricultural implement

Oh that is Illinois all over said De Forest They dont content
themselves with talking about privacy They arrange to have it And now
wheres your alleged fleet Arnott We must assert ourselves against
this wench

Arnott pointed to the black heavens

Waiting onup there said he Shall I give them the whole
installation sir

Oh I dont think the young lady is quite worth that said De Forest
Get over Chicago and perhaps well see something

In a few minutes we were hanging at two thousand feet over an oblong
block of incandescence in the centre of the little town

That looks like the old City Hall Yes theres Salatis Statue in
front of it said Takahira But what on earth are they doing to the
place I thought they used it for a market nowadays Drop a
little please

We could hear the sputter and crackle of roadsurfacing machinesthe
cheap Western type which fuse stone and rubbish into lavalike ribbed
glass for their rough country roads Three or four surfacers worked on
each side of a square of ruins The brick and stone wreckage crumbled
slid forward and presently spread out into whitehot pools of sticky
slag which the levellingrods smoothed more or less flat Already a
third of the big block had been so treated and was cooling to dull red
before our astonished eyes

It is the Old Market said De Forest Well theres nothing to
prevent Illinois from making a road through a market It doesnt
interfere with traffic that I can see

Hsh said Arnott gripping me by the shoulder Listen Theyre
singing Why on the earth are they singing

We dropped again till we could see the black fringe of people at the
edge of that glowing square

At first they only roared against the roar of the surfacers and
levellers Then the words came up clearlythe words of the Forbidden
Song that all men knew and none let pass their lipspoor Pat
MacDonoughs Song made in the days of the Crowds and the Plagueevery
silly word of it loaded to sparkingpoint with the Planets inherited
memories of horror panic fear and cruelty And Chicagoinnocent
contented little Chicagowas singing it aloud to the infernal tune that
carried riot pestilence and lunacy round our Planet a few
generations ago

     Once there was The PeopleTerror gave it birth
     Once there was The People and it made a hell of earth

Then the stamp and pause

     Earth arose and crushed it Listen oh ye slain
     Once there was The Peopleit shall never be again

The levellers thrust in savagely against the ruins as the song renewed
itself again again and again louder than the crash of the
melting walls

De Forest frowned

I dont like that he said Theyve broken back to the Old Days
Theyll be killing somebody soon I think wed better divert
em Arnott

Ay ay sir Arnotts hand went to his cap and we heard the hull of
the Victor Pirolo ring to the command Lamps Both watches stand by
Lamps Lamps Lamps

Keep still Takahira whispered to me Blinkers please
quartermaster

Its all rightall right said Pirolo from behind and to my horror
slipped over my head some sort of rubber helmet that locked with a snap
I could feel thick colloid bosses before my eyes but I stood in
absolute darkness

To save the sight he explained and pushed me on to the chartroom
divan You will see in a minute

As he spoke I became aware of a thin thread of almost intolerable light
let down from heaven at an immense distanceone vertical hairsbreadth
of frozen lightning

Those are our flanking ships said Arnott at my elbow That one is
over Galena Look souththat other ones over Keithburg Vincennes is
behind us and north yonder is Winthrop Woods The Fleets in position
sirthis to De Forest As soon as you give the word

Ah no No cried Dragomiroff at my side I could feel the old man
tremble I do not know all that you can do but be kind I ask you to
be a little kind to them below This is horriblehorrible

     When a Woman kills a Chicken
     Dynasties and Empires sicken

Takahira quoted It is too late to be gentle now

Then take off my helmet Take off my helmet Dragomiroff began
hysterically

Pirolo must have put his arm round him

Hush he said I am here It is all right Ivan my dear fellow

Ill just send our little girl in Bureau County a warning said
Arnott She dont deserve it but well allow her a minute or two to
take mamma to the cellar

In the utter hush that followed the growling spark after Arnott had
linked up his Service Communicator with the invisible Fleet we heard
MacDonoughs Song from the city beneath us grow fainter as we rose to
position Then I clapped my hand before my mask lenses for it was as
though the floor of Heaven had been riddled and all the inconceivable
blaze of suns in the making was poured through the manholes

You neednt count said Arnott I had had no thought of such a thing
There are two hundred and fifty keels up there five miles apart Full
power please for another twelve seconds

The firmament as far as eye could reach stood on pillars of white
fire One fell on the glowing square at Chicago and turned it black

Oh Oh Oh Can men be allowed to do such things Dragomiroff cried
and fell across our knees

Glass of water please said Takahira to a helmeted shape that leaped
forward He is a little faint

The lights switched off and the darkness stunned like an avalanche We
could hear Dragomiroffs teeth on the glass edge

Pirolo was comforting him

All right all raight he repeated Come and lie down Come below
and take off your mask I give you my word old friend it is all right
They are my siegelights Little Victor Pirolos leetle lights You know
me I do not hurt people

Pardon Dragomiroff moaned I have never seen Death I have never
seen the Board take action Shall we go down and burn them alive or is
that already done

Oh hush said Pirolo and I think he rocked him in his arms

Do we repeat sir Arnott asked De Forest

Give em a minutes break De Forest replied They may need it

We waited a minute and then MacDonoughs Song broken but defiant rose
from undefeated Chicago

They seem fond of that tune said De Forest I should let em have
it Arnott

Very good sir said Arnott and felt his way to the Communicator
keys

No lights broke forth but the hollow of the skies made herself the
mouth for one note that touched the raw fibre of the brain Men hear
such sounds in delirium advancing like tides from horizons beyond the
ruled foreshores of space

Thats our pitchpipe said Arnott We may be a bit ragged Ive
never conducted two hundred and fifty performers before He pulled out
the couplers and struck a full chord on the Service Communicators

The beams of light leaped down again and danced solemnly and awfully
a stiltdance sweeping thirty or forty miles left and right at each
stifflegged kick while the darkness delivered itselfthere is no
scale to measure against that utteranceof the tune to which they kept
time Certain notesone learnt to expect them with terrorcut through
ones marrow but after three minutes thought and emotion passed in
indescribable agony

We saw we heard but I think we were in some sort swooning The two
hundred and fifty beams shifted reformed straddled and split
narrowed widened rippled in ribbons broke into a thousand whitehot
parallel lines melted and revolved in interwoven rings like
oldfashioned engineturning flung up to the zenith made as if to
descend and renew the torment halted at the last instant twizzled
insanely round the horizon and vanished to bring back for the
hundredth time darkness more shattering than their instantly renewed
light over all Illinois Then the tune and lights ceased together and
we heard one single devastating wail that shook all the horizon as a
rubbed wet finger shakes the rim of a bowl

Ah that is my new siren said Pirolo You can break an iceberg in
half if you find the proper pitch They will whistle by squadrons now
It is the wind through pierced shutters in the bows

I had collapsed beside Dragomiroff broken and snivelling feebly
because I had been delivered before my time to all the terrors of
Judgment Day and the Archangels of the Resurrection were hailing me
naked across the Universe to the sound of the music of the spheres

Then I saw De Forest smacking Arnotts helmet with his open hand The
wailing died down in a long shriek as a black shadow swooped past us
and returned to her place above the lower clouds

I hate to interrupt a specialist when hes enjoying himself said De
Forest But as a matter of fact all Illinois has been asking us to
stop for these last fifteen seconds

What a pity Arnott slipped off his mask I wanted you to hear us
really hum Our lower C can lift streetpaving

It is HellHell cried Dragomiroff and sobbed aloud

Arnott looked away as he answered

Its a few thousand volts ahead of the old shootemandsinkem game
but I should scarcely call it that What shall I tell the Fleet sir

Tell em were very pleased and impressed I dont think they need wait
on any longer There isnt a spark left down there De Forest pointed
Theyll be deaf and blind

Oh I think not sir The demonstration lasted less than ten minutes

Marvellous Takahira sighed I should have said it was half a night
Now shall we go down and pick up the pieces

But first a small drink said Pirolo The Board must not arrive
weeping at its own works

I am an old foolan old fool Dragomiroff began piteously I did not
know what would happen It is all new to me We reason with them in
Little Russia

Chicago North landingtower was unlighted and Arnott worked his ship
into the clips by her own lights As soon as these broke out we heard
groanings of horror and appeal from many people below

All right shouted Arnott into the darkness We arent beginning
again We descended by the stairs to find ourselves kneedeep in a
grovelling crowd some crying that they were blind others beseeching us
not to make any more noises but the greater part writhing face
downward their hands or their caps before their eyes

It was Pirolo who came to our rescue He climbed the side of a
surfacingmachine and there gesticulating as though they could see
made oration to those afflicted people of Illinois

You stchewpids he began There is nothing to fuss for Of course
your eyes will smart and be red tomorrow You will look as if you and
your wives had drunk too much but in a little while you will see again
as well as before I tell you this and II am Pirolo Victor Pirolo

The crowd with one accord shuddered for many legends attach to Victor
Pirolo of Foggia deep in the secrets of God

Pirolo An unsteady voice lifted itself Then tell us was there
anything except light in those lights of yours just now

The question was repeated from every corner of the darkness

Pirolo laughed

No he thundered Why have small men such large voices I give you
my word and the Boards word that there was nothing except lightjust
light You stchewpids Your birthrate is too low already as it is Some
day I must invent something to send it up but send it downnever

Is that trueWe thoughtsomebody said

One could feel the tension relax all round

You too big fools Pirolo cried You could have sent us a call and we
would have told you

Send you a call a deep voice shouted I wish you had been at our end
of the wire

Im glad I wasnt said De Forest It was bad enough from behind the
lamps Never mind Its over now Is there any one here I can talk
business with Im De Forestfor the Board

You might begin with me for oneIm Mayor the bass voice replied

A big man rose unsteadily from the street and staggered towards us
where we sat on the broad turfedging in front of the garden fences

I ought to be the first on my feet Am I said he

Yes said De Forest and steadied him as he dropped down beside us

Hello Andy Is that you a voice called

Excuse me said the Mayor that sounds like my Chief of Police
Bluthner

Bluthner it is and heres Mulligan and Keefeon their feet

Bring em up please Blut Were supposed to be the Four in charge of
this hamlet What we says goes And De Forest what do you say

Nothingyet De Forest answered as we made room for the panting
reeling men Youve cut out of system Well

Tell the steward to send down drinks please Arnott whispered to an
orderly at his side

Good said the Mayor smacking his dry lips Now I suppose we can
take it De Forest that henceforward the Board will administer
us direct

Not if the Board can avoid it De Forest laughed The ABC is
responsible for the planetary traffic only

And all that that implies The big Four who ran Chicago chanted
their Magna Charta like children at school

Well get on said De Forest wearily What is your silly trouble
anyway

Too much dam Democracy said the Mayor laying his hand on De
Forests knee

So I thought Illinois had had her dose of that

She has Thats why Blut what did you do with our prisoners last
night

Locked em in the watertower to prevent the women killing em the
Chief of Police replied Im too blind to move just yet but

Arnott send some of your people please and fetch em along said De
Forest

Theyre triplecircuited the Mayor called Youll have to blow out
three fuses He turned to De Forest his large outline just visible in
the paling darkness I hate to throw any more work on the Board Im an
administrator myself but weve had a little fuss with our Serviles
What In a big city theres bound to be a few men and women who cant
live without listening to themselves and who prefer drinking out of
pipes they dont own both ends of They inhabit flats and hotels all the
year round They say it saves em trouble Anyway it gives em more
time to make trouble for their neighbours We call em Serviles locally
And they are apt to be tuberculous

Just so said the man called Mulligan Transportation is Civilisation
Democracy is Disease Ive proved it by the bloodtest every time

Mulligans our Health Officer and a oneidea man said the Mayor
laughing But its true that most Serviles havent much control They
will talk and when people take to talking as a business anything may
arrivemaynt it De Forest

Anythingexcept the facts of the case said De Forest laughing

Ill give you those in a minute said the Mayor Our Serviles got to
talkingfirst in their houses and then on the streets telling men and
women how to manage their own affairs You cant teach a Servile not to
finger his neighbours soul Thats invasion of privacy of course but
in Chicago well suffer anything sooner than make Crowds Nobody took
much notice and so I let em alone My fault I was warned there would
be trouble but there hasnt been a Crowd or murder in Illinois for
nineteen years

Twentytwo said his Chief of Police

Likely Anyway wed forgot such things So from talking in the houses
and on the streets our Serviles go to calling a meeting at the Old
Market yonder He nodded across the square where the wrecked buildings
heaved up grey in the dawnglimmer behind the squarecased statue of The
Negro in Flames Theres nothing to prevent any one calling meetings
except that its against human nature to stand in a Crowd besides being
bad for the health I ought to have known by the way our men and women
attended that first meeting that trouble was brewing There were as many
as a thousand in the marketplace touching each other Touching Then
the Serviles turned in all tongueswitches and talked and we

What did they talk about said Takahira

First how badly things were managed in the city That pleased us
Fourwe were on the platformbecause we hoped to catch one or two
good men for City work You know how rare executive capacity is Even if
we didnt itsits refreshing to find any one interested enough in our
job to damn our eyes You dont know what it means to work year in
year out without a spark of difference with a living soul

Oh dont we said De Forest There are times on the Board when wed
give our positions if any one would kick us out and take hold of things
themselves

But they wont said the Mayor ruefully I assure you sir we Four
have done things in Chicago in the hope of rousing people that would
have discredited Nero But what do they say Very good Andy Have it
your own way Anythings better than a Crowd Ill go back to my land
You cant do anything with folk who can go where they please and
dont want anything on Gods earth except their own way There isnt a
kick or a kicker left on the Planet

Then I suppose that little shed yonder fell down by itself said De
Forest We could see the bare and still smoking ruins and hear the
slagpools crackle as they hardened and set

Oh thats only amusement Tell you later As I was saying our
Serviles held the meeting and pretty soon we had to groundcircuit the
platform to save em from being killed And that didnt make our people
any more pacific

How dyou mean I ventured to ask

If youve ever been groundcircuited said the Mayor youll know it
dont improve any mans temper to be held up straining against nothing
No sir Eight or nine hundred folk kept pawing and buzzing like flies
in treacle for two hours while a pack of perfectly safe Serviles
invades their mental and spiritual privacy may be amusing to watch but
they are not pleasant to handle afterwards

Pirolo chuckled

Our folk own themselves They were of opinion things were going too far
and too fiery I warned the Serviles but theyre born housedwellers
Unless a fact hits em on the head they cannot see it Would you believe
me they went on to talk of what they called popular government They
did They wanted us to go back to the old Voodoobusiness of voting with
papers and wooden boxes and worddrunk people and printed formulas and
newssheets They said they practised it among themselves about what
theyd have to eat in their flats and hotels Yes sir They stood up
behind Bluthners doubled groundcircuits and they said that in this
present year of grace to selfowning men and women on that very
spot Then they finishedhe lowered his voice cautiouslyby talking
about The People And then Bluthner he had to sit up all night in
charge of the circuits because he couldnt trust his men to keep
em shut

It was trying em too high the Chief of Police broke in But we
couldnt hold the Crowd groundcircuited for ever I gathered in all the
Serviles on charge of Crowdmaking and put em in the watertower and
then I let things cut loose I had to The District lit like a sparked
gastank

The news was out over seven degrees of country the Mayor continued
and when once its a question of invasion of privacy goodbye to right
and reason in Illinois They began turning out trafficlights and
locking up landingtowers on Thursday night Friday they stopped all
traffic and asked for the Board to take over Then they wanted to clean
Chicago off the side of the Lake and rebuild elsewherejust for a
souvenir of The People that the Serviles talked about I suggested
that they should slag the Old Market where the meeting was held while I
turned in a call to you all on the Board That kept em quiet till you
came along Andand now you can take hold of the situation

Any chance of their quieting down De Forest asked

You can try said the Mayor

De Forest raised his voice in the face of the reviving Crowd that had
edged in towards us Day was come

Dont you think this business can be arranged he began But there was
a roar of angry voices

Weve finished with Crowds We arent going back to the Old Days Take
us over Take the Serviles away Administer direct or well kill em
Down with The People

An attempt was made to begin MacDonoughs Song It got no further than
the first line for the Victor Pirolo sent down a warning drone on one
stopped horn A wrecked sidewall of the Old Market tottered and fell
inwards on the slagpools None spoke or moved till the last of the dust
had settled down again turning the steel case of Salatis Statue
ashy grey

You see youll just have to take us over the Mayor whispered

De Forest shrugged his shoulders

You talk as if executive capacity could be snatched out of the air like
so much horsepower Cant you manage yourselves on any terms he said

We can if you say so It will only cost those few lives to begin
with

The Mayor pointed across the square where Arnotts men guided a
stumbling group of ten or twelve men and women to the lake front and
halted them under the Statue

Now I think said Takahira under his breath there will be trouble

The mass in front of us growled like beasts

At that moment the sun rose clear and revealed the blinking assembly to
itself As soon as it realized that it was a crowd we saw the shiver of
horror and mutual repulsion shoot across it precisely as the steely
flaws shot across the lake outside Nothing was said and being half
blind of course it moved slowly Yet in less than fifteen minutes most
of that vast multitudethree thousand at the lowest countmelted away
like frost on south eaves The remnant stretched themselves on the
grass where a crowd feels and looks less like a crowd

These mean business the Mayor whispered to Takahira There are a
goodish few women there whove borne children I dont like it

The morning draught off the lake stirred the trees round us with promise
of a hot day the sun reflected itself dazzlingly on the canistershaped
covering of Salatis Statue cocks crew in the gardens and we could
hear gatelatches clicking in the distance as people stumblingly
resought their homes

Im afraid there wont be any morning deliveries said De Forest We
rather upset things in the country last night

That makes no odds the Mayor returned Were all provisioned for six
months We take no chances

Nor when you come to think of it does any one else It must be
threequarters of a generation since any house or city faced a food
shortage Yet is there house or city on the Planet today that has not
half a years provisions laid in We are like the shipwrecked seamen in
the old books who having once nearly starved to death ever afterwards
hide away bits of food and biscuit Truly we trust no Crowds nor system
based on Crowds

De Forest waited till the last footstep had died away Meantime the
prisoners at the base of the Statue shuffled posed and fidgeted with
the shamelessness of quite little children None of them were more than
six feet high and many of them were as greyhaired as the ravaged
harassed heads of old pictures They huddled together in actual touch
while the crowd spaced at large intervals looked at them with
congested eyes

Suddenly a man among them began to talk The Mayor had not in the least
exaggerated It appeared that our Planet lay sunk in slavery beneath the
heel of the Arial Board of Control The orator urged us to arise in our
might burst our prison doors and break our fetters all his metaphors
by the way were of the most medival Next he demanded that every
matter of daily life including most of the physical functions should
be submitted for decision at any time of the week month or year to I
gathered anybody who happened to be passing by or residing within a
certain radius and that everybody should forthwith abandon his concerns
to settle the matter first by crowdmaking next by talking to the
crowds made and lastly by describing crosses on pieces of paper which
rubbish should later be counted with certain mystic ceremonies and
oaths Out of this amazing play he assured us would automatically
arise a higher nobler and kinder world basedhe demonstrated this
with the awful lucidity of the insanebased on the sanctity of the
Crowd and the villainy of the single person In conclusion he called
loudly upon God to testify to his personal merits and integrity When
the flow ceased I turned bewildered to Takahira who was
nodding solemnly

Quite correct said he It is all in the old books He has left
nothing out not even the wartalk

But I dont see how this stuff can upset a child much less a
district I replied

Ah you are too young said Dragomiroff For another thing you are
not a mamma Please look at the mammas

Ten or fifteen women who remained had separated themselves from the
silent men and were drawing in towards the prisoners It reminded one
of the stealthy encircling before the rush in at the quarry of wolves
round muskoxen in the North The prisoners saw and drew together more
closely The Mayor covered his face with his hands for an instant De
Forest bareheaded stepped forward between the prisoners and the
slowly stiffly moving line

Thats all very interesting he said to the drylipped orator But
the point seems that youve been making crowds and invading privacy

A woman stepped forward and would have spoken but there was a quick
assenting murmur from the men who realised that De Forest was trying to
pull the situation down to groundline

Yes Yes they cried We cut out because they made crowds and invaded
privacy Stick to that Keep on that switch Lift the Serviles out of
this The Boards in charge Hsh

Yes the Boards in charge said De Forest Ill take formal evidence
of crowdmaking if you like but the Members of the Board can testify to
it Will that do

The women had closed in another pace with hands that clenched and
unclenched at their sides

Good Good enough the men cried Were content Only take them away
quickly

Come along up said De Forest to the captives Breakfast is quite
ready

It appeared however that they did not wish to go They intended to
remain in Chicago and make crowds They pointed out that De Forests
proposal was gross invasion of privacy

My dear fellow said Pirolo to the most voluble of the leaders you
hurry or your crowd that cant be wrong will kill you

But that would be murder answered the believer in crowds and there
was a roar of laughter from all sides that seemed to show the crisis
had broken

A woman stepped forward from the line of women laughing I protest as
merrily as any of the company One hand of course shaded her eyes the
other was at her throat

Oh they neednt be afraid of being killed she called

Not in the least said De Forest But dont you think that now the
Boards in charge you might go home while we get these people away

I shall be home long before that Itit has been rather a trying day

She stood up to her full height dwarfing even De Forests
sixfooteight and smiled with eyes closed against the fierce light

Yes rather said De Forest Im afraid you feel the glare a little
Well have the ship down

He motioned to the Pirolo to drop between us and the sun and at the
same time to loopcircuit the prisoners who were a trifle unsteady We
saw them stiffen to the current where they stood The womans voice went
on sweet and deep and unshaken

I dont suppose you men realise how much thisthis sort of thing means
to a woman Ive borne three We women dont want our children given to
Crowds It must be an inherited instinct Crowds make trouble They
bring back the Old Days Hate fear blackmail publicity The
PeopleThat That That She pointed to the Statue and the crowd
growled once more

Yes if they are allowed to go on said De Forest But this little
affair

It means so much to us women that thisthis little affair should never
happen again Of course nevers a big word but one feels so strongly
that it is important to stop crowds at the very beginning Those
creaturesshe pointed with her left hand at the prisoners swaying like
seaweed in a tideway as the circuit pulled themthose people have
friends and wives and children in the city and elsewhere One doesnt
want anything done to them you know Its terrible to force a human
being out of fifty or sixty years of good life Im only forty myself
I know But at the same time one feels that an example should be
made because no price is too heavy to pay ifif these people and all
that they imply can be put an end to Do you quite understand or would
you be kind enough to tell your men to take the casing off the Statue
Its worth looking at

I understand perfectly But I dont think anybody here wants to see
the Statue on an empty stomach Excuse me one moment De Forest called
up to the ship A flying loop ready on the port side if you please
Then to the woman he said with some crispness You might leave us a
little discretion in the matter

Oh of course Thank you for being so patient I know my arguments are
silly but She half turned away and went on in a changed voice
Perhaps this will help you to decide

She threw out her right arm with a knife in it Before the blade could
be returned to her throat or her bosom it was twitched from her grip
sparked as it flew out of the shadow of the ship above and fell
flashing in the sunshine at the foot of the Statue fifty yards away The
outflung arm was arrested rigid as a bar for an instant till the
releasing circuit permitted her to bring it slowly to her side The
other women shrank back silent among the men

Pirolo rubbed his hands and Takahira nodded

That was clever of you De Forest said he

What a glorious pose Dragomiroff murmured for the frightened woman
was on the edge of tears

Why did you stop me I would have done it she cried

I have no doubt you would said De Forest But we cant waste a life
like yours on these people I hope the arrest didnt sprain your wrist
its so hard to regulate a flying loop But I think you are quite right
about those persons women and children Well take them all away with
us if you promise not to do anything stupid to yourself

I promiseI promise She controlled herself with an effort But it
is so important to us women We know what it means and I thought if you
saw I was in earnest

I saw you were and youve gained your point I shall take all your
Serviles away with me at once The Mayor will make lists of their
friends and families in the city and the district and hell ship them
after us this afternoon

Sure said the Mayor rising to his feet Keefe if you can see
hadnt you better finish levelling off the Old Market It dont look
sightly the way it is now and we shant use it for crowds any more

I think you had better wipe out that Statue as well Mr Mayor said
De Forest I dont question its merits as a work of art but I believe
its a shade morbid

Certainly sir Oh Keefe Slag the Nigger before you go on to fuse the
Market Ill get to the Communicators and tell the District that the
Board is in charge Are you making any special appointments sir

None We havent men to waste on these backwoods Carry on as before
but under the Board Arnott run your Serviles aboard please Ground
ship and pass them through the bilgedoors Well wait till weve
finished with this work of art

The prisoners trailed past him talking fluently but unable to
gesticulate in the drag of the current Then the surfacers rolled up
two on each side of the Statue With one accord the spectators looked
elsewhere but there was no need Keefe turned on full power and the
thing simply melted within its case All I saw was a surge of whitehot
metal pouring over the plinth a glimpse of Salatis inscription To the
Eternal Memory of the Justice of the People ere the stone base itself
cracked and powdered into finest lime The crowd cheered

Thank you said De Forest but we want our breakfasts and I expect
you do too Goodbye Mr Mayor Delighted to see you at any time but I
hope I shant have to officially for the next thirty years Goodbye
madam Yes Were all given to nerves nowadays I suffer from them
myself Goodbye gentlemen all Youre under the tyrannous heel of the
Board from this moment but if ever you feel like breaking your fetters
youve only to let us know This is no treat to us Good luck

We embarked amid shouts and did not check our lift till they had
dwindled into whispers Then De Forest flung himself on the chartroom
divan and mopped his forehead

I dont mind men he panted but women are the devil

Still the devil said Pirolo cheerfully That one would have
suicided

I know it That was why I signalled for the flying loop to be clapped
on her I owe you an apology for that Arnott I hadnt time to catch
your eye and you were busy with our caitiffs By the way who actually
answered my signal It was a smart piece of work

Ilroy said Arnott but he overloaded the wave It may be pretty
gallerywork to knock a knife out of a ladys hand but didnt you
notice how she rubbed em He scorched her fingers Slovenly I
call it

Far be it from me to interfere with Fleet discipline but dont be too
hard on the boy If that woman had killed herself they would have killed
every Servile and everything related to a Servile throughout the
district by nightfall

That was what she was playing for Takahira said And with our Fleet
gone we could have done nothing to hold them

I may be ass enough to walk into a groundcircuit said Arnott but I
dont dismiss my Fleet till Im reasonably sure that trouble is over
Theyre in position still and I intend to keep em there till the
Serviles are shipped out of the district That last little crowd meant
murder my friends

Nerves All nerves said Pirolo You cannot argue with agoraphobia

And it is not as if they had seen much deador is it said
Takahira

In all my ninety years I have never seen Death Dragomiroff spoke as
one who would excuse himself Perhaps that was whylast night

Then it came out as we sat over breakfast that with the exception of
Arnott and Pirolo none of us had ever seen a corpse or knew in what
manner the spirit passes

Were a nice lot to flap about governing the Planet De Forest
laughed I confess now its all over that my main fear was I mightnt
be able to pull it off without losing a life

I thought of that too said Arnott but theres no death reported
and Ive inquired everywhere What are we supposed to do with our
passengers Ive fed em

Were between two switches De Forest drawled If we drop them in any
place that isnt under the Board the natives will make their presence an
excuse for cutting out same as Illinois did and forcing the Board to
take over If we drop them in any place under the Boards control
theyll be killed as soon as our backs are turned

If you say so said Pirolo thoughtfully I can guarantee that they
will become extinct in process of time quite happily What is their
birthrate now

Go down and ask em said De Forest

I think they might become nervous and tear me to bits the philosopher
of Foggia replied

Not really Well

Open the bilgedoors said Takahira with a downward jerk of the thumb

Scarcelyafter all the trouble weve taken to save em said De
Forest

Try London Arnott suggested You could turn Satan himself loose
there and theyd only ask him to dinner

Good man Youve given me an idea Vincent Oh Vincent He threw the
General Communicator open so that we could all hear and in a few
minutes the chartroom filled with the rich fruity voice of Leopold
Vincent who has purveyed all London her choicest amusements for the
last thirty years We answered with expectant grins as though we were
actually in the stalls of say the Combination on a first night

Weve picked up something in your line De Forest began

Thats good dear man If its old enough Theres nothing to beat the
old things for business purposes Have you seen London Chatham and
Dover at Earls Court No I thought I missed you there Immense Ive
had the real steam locomotive engines built from the old designs and the
iron rails cast specially by hand Cloth cushions in the carriages too
Immense And paper railway tickets And Polly Milton

Polly Milton back again said Arnott rapturously Book me two stalls
for tomorrow night Whats she singing now bless her

The old songs Nothing comes up to the old touch Listen to this dear
men Vincent carolled with flourishes

     Oh cruel lamps of London
     If tears your light could drown
     Your victims eyes would weep them
     Oh lights of London Town

Then they weep

You see Pirolo waved his hands at us The old world always weeped
when it saw crowds together It did not know why but it weeped We know
why but we do not weep except when we pay to be made to by fat wicked
old Vincent

Old yourself Vincent laughed Im a public benefactor I keep the
world soft and united

And Im De Forest of the Board said De Forest acidly trying to get
a little business done As I was saying Ive picked up a few people
in Chicago

I cut out Chicago is

Do listen Theyre perfectly unique

Do they build houses of baked mudblocks while you waiteh Thats an
old contact

Theyre an untouched primitive community with all the old ideas

Sewingmachines and maypoledances Cooking on coalgas stoves
lighting pipes with matches and driving horses Gerolstein tried that
last year An absolute blowout

De Forest plugged him wrathfully and poured out the story of our doings
for the last twentyfour hours on the topnote

And they do it all in public he concluded You cant stop em The
more public the better they are pleased Theyll talk for hourslike
you Now you can come in again

Do you really mean they know how to vote said Vincent Can they act
it

Act Its their life to em And you never saw such faces Scarred
like volcanoes Envy hatred and malice in plain sight Wonderfully
flexible voices They weep too

Aloud In public

I guarantee Not a spark of shame or reticence in the entire
installation Its the chance of your career

Dyou say youve brought their voting props alongthose papers and
ballotbox things

No confound you Im not a luggagelifter Apply direct to the Mayor
of Chicago Hell forward you everything Well

Wait a minute Did Chicago want to kill em That ud look well on the
Communicators

Yes They were only rescued with difficulty from a howling mobif you
know what that is

But I dont answered the Great Vincent simply

Well then theyll tell you themselves They can make speeches hours
long

How many are there

By the time we ship em all over theyll be perhaps a hundred counting
children An old world in miniature Cant you see it

Myes but Ive got to pay for it if its a blowout dear man

They can sing the old war songs in the streets They can get
worddrunk and make crowds and invade privacy in the genuine
oldfashioned way and theyll do the voting trick as often as you ask
em a question

Too good said Vincent

You unbelieving Jew Ive got a dozen head aboard here Ill put you
through direct Sample em yourself

He lifted the switch and we listened Our passengers on the lower deck
at once but not less than five at a time explained themselves to
Vincent They had been taken from the bosom of their families stripped
of their possessions given food without fingerbowls and cast into
captivity in a noisome dungeon

But look here said Arnott aghast theyre saying what isnt true My
lower deck isnt noisome and I saw to the fingerbowls myself

My people talk like that sometimes in Little Russia said Dragomiroff
We reason with them We never kill No

But its not true Arnott insisted What can you do with people who
dont tell facts Theyre mad

Hsh said Pirolo his hand to his ear It is such a little time since
all the Planet told lies

We heard Vincent silkily sympathetic Would they he asked repeat their
assertions in publicbefore a vast public Only let Vincent give them a
chance and the Planet they vowed should ring with their wrongs Their
aim in lifetwo women and a man explained it togetherwas to reform
the world Oddly enough this also had been Vincents lifedream He
offered them an arena in which to explain and by their living example
to raise the Planet to loftier levels He was eloquent on the moral
uplift of a simple oldworld life presented in its entirety to a
deboshed civilisation

Could theywould theyfor three months certain devote themselves
under his auspices as missionaries to the elevation of mankind at a
place called Earls Court which he said with some truth was one of
the intellectual centres of the Planet They thanked him and demanded
we could hear his chuckle of delight time to discuss and to vote on
the matter The vote solemnly managed by counting headsone head one
votewas favourable His offer therefore was accepted and they moved
a vote of thanks to him in two speechesone by what they called the
proposer and the other by the seconder

Vincent threw over to us his voice shaking with gratitude

Ive got em Did you hear those speeches Thats Nature dear men Art
cant teach that And they voted as easily as lying Ive never had a
troupe of natural liars before Bless you dear men Remember youre on
my free lists for ever anywhereall of you Oh Gerolstein will be
sicksick

Then you think theyll do said De Forest

Do The Little Villagell go crazy Ill knock up a series of oldworld
plays for em Their voices will make you laugh and cry My God dear
men where do you suppose they picked up all their misery from on
this sweet earth Ill have a pageant of the worlds beginnings and
Mosenthal shall do the music Ill

Go and knock up a village for em by tonight Well meet you at No 
West Landing Tower said De Forest Remember the rest will be coming
along tomorrow

Let em all come said Vincent You dont know how hard it is
nowadays even for me to find something that really gets under the
publics damned iridiumplated hide But Ive got it at last Goodbye

Well said De Forest when we had finished laughing if any one
understood corruption in London I might have played off Vincent against
Gerolstein and sold my captives at enormous prices As it is I shall
have to be their legal adviser tonight when the contracts are signed
And they wont exactly press any commission on me either

Meantime said Takahira we cannot of course confine members of
Leopold Vincents lastengaged company Chairs for the ladies
please Arnott

Then I go to bed said De Forest I cant face any more women And
he vanished

When our passengers were released and given another meal fingerbowls
came first this time they told us what they thought of us and the
Board and like Vincent we all marvelled how they had contrived to
extract and secrete so much bitter poison and unrest out of the good
life God gives us They raged they stormed they palpitated flushed
and exhausted their poor torn nerves panted themselves into silence
and renewed the senseless shameless attacks

But cant you understand said Pirolo pathetically to a shrieking
woman that if wed left you in Chicago youd have been killed

No we shouldnt You were bound to save us from being murdered

Then we should have had to kill a lot of other people

That doesnt matter We were preaching the Truth You cant stop us We
shall go on preaching in London and then youll see

You can see now said Pirolo and opened a lower shutter

We were closing on the Little Village with her three million people
spread out at ease inside her ring of girdling MainTraffic
lightsthose eight fixed beams at Chatham Tonbridge Redhill Dorking
Woking St Albans Chipping Ongar and Southend

Leopold Vincents new company looked with small pale faces at the
silence the size and the separated houses

Then some began to weep aloud shamelesslyalways without shame



     MACDONOUGHS SONG

     Whether the State can loose and bind
       In Heaven as well as on Earth
     If it be wiser to kill mankind
       Before or after the birth
     These are matters of high concern
       Where Statekept schoolmen are
     But Holy State we have lived to learn
       Endeth in Holy War

     Whether The People be led by the Lord
       Or lured by the loudest throat
     If it be quicker to die by the sword
       Or cheaper to die by vote
     These are the things we have dealt with once
       And they will not rise from their grave
     For Holy People however it runs
       Endeth in wholly Slave

     Whatsoever for any cause
       Seeketh to take or give
     Power above or beyond the Laws
       Suffer it not to live
     Holy State or Holy King
       Or Holy Peoples Will
     Have no truck with the senseless thing
       Order the guns and kill
         Sayingafterme

     Once there was The PeopleTerror gave it birth
     Once there was The People and it made a Hell of Earth
     Earth arose and crushed it Listen O ye slain
     Once there was The Peopleit shall never be again




Friendly Brook

March 


The valley was so choked with fog that one could scarcely see a cows
length across a field Every blade twig brackenfrond and hoofprint
carried water and the air was filled with the noise of rushing ditches
and fielddrains all delivering to the brook below A weeks November
rain on waterlogged land had gorged her to full flood and she
proclaimed it aloud

Two men in sackcloth aprons were considering an untrimmed hedge that ran
down the hillside and disappeared into mist beside those roarings They
stood back and took stock of the neglected growth tapped an elbow of
hedgeoak here a mossed beechstub there swayed a stooled ash back and
forth and looked at each other

I reckon shes about two rod thick said Jabez the younger an she
hasnt felt iron sincewhen has she Jesse

Call it twentyfive year Jabez an you wont be far out

Umm Jabez rubbed his wet handbill on his wetter coatsleeve She
aint a hedge Shes all manner o trees Well just about have to He
paused as professional etiquette required

Just about have to side her up an see what shell bear But hadnt we
best Jesse paused in his turn both men being artists and equals

Get some kind o line to go by Jabez ranged up and down till he found
a thinner place and with clean snicks of the handbill revealed the
original face of the fence Jesse took over the dripping stuff as it
fell forward and with a grasp and a kick made it to lie orderly on
the bank till it should be faggoted

By noon a length of unclean jungle had turned itself into a cattleproof
barrier tufted here and there with little plumes of the sacred holly
which no woodman touches without orders

Now weve a witnessboard to go by said Jesse at last

She wont be as easy as this all along Jabez answered Shell need
plenty stakes and binders when we come to the brook

Well aint we plenty Jesse pointed to the ragged perspective ahead
of them that plunged downhill into the fog I lay theres a cord an a
half o firewood let alone faggots fore we get anywheres anigh
the brook

The brooks got up a piece since morning said Jabez Sounds likes
if she was over Wickendens doorstones

Jesse listened too There was a growl in the brooks roar as though she
worried something hard

Yes Shes over Wickendens doorstones he replied Now shell flood
acrost Alder Bay an thatll ease her

She wont ease Jim Wickendens hay none if she do Jabez grunted I
told Jim hed set that liddle haystack o his too low down in the
medder I told him so when he was drawin the bottom for it

I told him so too said Jesse I told him fore ever you did I told
him when the County Council tarred the roads up along He pointed
uphill where unseen automobiles and roadengines droned past
continually A tarred road she shoots every drop o water into a
valley sames a slate roof Tisnt as twas in the old days when the
waters soaked in and soaked out in the way o nature It rooshes off
they tarred roads all of a lump and naturally every drop is bound to
descend into the valley And theres tar roads both two sides this
valley for ten mile Thats what I told Jim Wickenden when they tarred
the roads last year But hes a valleyman He dont hardly ever
journey uphill

What did he say when you told him that Jabez demanded with a little
change of voice

Why What did he say to you when you told him was the answer

What he said to you I reckon Jesse

Then you dont need me to say it over again Jabez

Well let be how twill what was he gettin after when he said what
he said to me Jabez insisted

I dunno unless you tell me what manner o words he said to you

Jabez drew back from the hedgeall hedges are nests of treachery and
eavesdroppingand moved to an open cattlelodge in the centre of
the field

No need to go ferretin around said Jesse None cant see us here
fore we see them

What was Jim Wickenden gettin at when I said hed set his stack too
near anigh the brook Jabez dropped his voice He was in his mind

He aint never been out of it yet to my knowledge Jesse drawled and
uncorked his teabottle

But then Jim says I aint goin to shift my stack a yard he says
The Brooks been good friends to me and if she be minded he says
to take a snatch at my hay I aint settin out to withstand her
Thats what Jim Wickenden says to me lastlast Juneend twas
said Jabez

Nor he hasnt shifted his stack neither Jesse replied An if
theres more rain the brook shell shift it for him

No need tell me But I want to know what Jim was gettin at

Jabez opened his claspknife very deliberately Jesse as carefully
opened his They unfolded the newspapers that wrapped their dinners
coiled away and pocketed the string that bound the packages and sat
down on the edge of the lodge manger The rain began to fall again
through the fog and the brooks voice rose

                                   

But I always allowed Mary was his lawful child like said Jabez
after Jesse had spoken for a while

Taint so Jim Wickendens woman she never made nothing She come
out o Lewes with her stockins round her heels an she never made nor
mended aught till she died He had to light fire an get breakfast
every mornin except Sundays while she sowed it abed Then she took an
died sixteen seventeen year back but she never had no childern

They was valleyfolk said Jabez apologetically Id no call to go in
among em but I always allowed Mary

No Mary come out o one o those Lunnon Childern Societies After his
woman died Jim got his mother back from his sister over to Peasmarsh
which shed gone to house with when Jim married His mother kept house
for Jim after his woman died They do say twas his mother led him on
toward adoptin of Maryto furnish out the house with a child like
and to keep him off of gettin a noo woman He mostly done what his
mother contrived Cardenly twixt em they asked for a child from one
o those Lunnon societiessame as it might ha been these Barnardo
childrenan Mary was sent down to em in a candlebox Ive heard

Then Mary is chanceborn I never knowed that said Jabez Yet I must
ha heard it some time or other 

No She aint Twould ha been better for some folk if she had been
She come to Jim in a candlebox with all the proper paperslawful child
o some couple in Lunnon somewheresmother dead father drinkin
And there was that Lunnon societys five shillins a week for her
Jims mother she wouldnt despise weekend money but I never heard Jim
was much of a muckgrubber Let be how twill they two mothered up Mary
no bounds till it looked at last like theyd forgot she wasnt their
own flesh an blood Yes I reckon they forgot Mary wasnt theirn
by rights

Thats no new thing said Jabez Theres moren one or two in this
parish wouldnt surrender back their Bernarders You ask Mark Copley an
his woman an that Bernarder cripplebabe o theirs

Maybe they need the five shillin Jesse suggested

Its handy said Jabez But the childs more Dada he says an
Mumma he says with his great rollin headpiece all hurdled up in
that iron collar He wont live longhis backbones rotten like But
they Copleys do just about set store by himfive bob or no five bob

Same way with Jim an his mother Jesse went on There was talk
betwixt em after a few years o not takin any more weekend money for
Mary but let alone she never passed a farden in the mire thout
longins Jim didnt care like to push himself forward into the
Societys remembrance So naun came of it The weekend money would ha
made no odds to Jimnot after his uncle willed him they four cottages
at Eastbourne an money in the bank

That was true too then I heard something in a scadderin
wordomouth way said Jabez

Ill answer for the house property because Jim he requested my signed
name at the foot o some papers concernin it Regardin the money in
the bank he natureally wouldnt like such things talked about all
round the parish so he took strangers for witnesses

Then twill make Mary worth seekin after

Shell need it Her Maker aint done much for her outside nor yet in

That aint no odds Jabez shook his head till the water showered off
his hatbrim If Mary has money shell be wed before any likely pore
maid Shes cause to be grateful to Jim

She hides it middlin close then said Jesse It dont sometimes
look to me as if Mary has her natural rightful feelins She dont put
on an apron o Mondays thout being druv to itin the kitchen or the
henhouse Shes studyin to be a schoolteacher Shell make a beauty
I never knowed her show any sort o kindness to nobodynot even when
Jims mother was took dumb No Twadnt no stroke It stifled the old
lady in the throat here First she couldnt shape her words no shape
then she clucked like an lastly she couldnt more than suck down
spoonmeat an hold her peace Jim took her to Doctor Harding an
Harding he bundled her off to Brighton Hospital on a ticket but they
couldnt make no stay to her afflictions there and she was bundled off
to Lunnon an they lit a great old lamp inside her and Jim told me
they couldnt make out nothing in no sort there and along o one thing
an another an all their spyins and pryins she come back a hem
sight worse than when she started Jim said hed have no more
hospitalizin so he give her a slate which she tied to her
waiststring and what she was minded to say she writ on it

Now I never knowed that But theyre valleyfolk Jabez repeated

Twadnt particular noticeable for she wasnt a talkin woman any time
o her days Mary had all threes tongue Well then two years this
summer come what Im tellin you Marys Lunnon father which theyd
put clean out o their minds arrived down from Lunnon with the law on
his side sayin hed take his daughter back to Lunnon after all I was
working for Mus Dockett at Pounds Farm that summer but I was obligin
Jim that evenin muckin out his pigpen I seed a stranger come
traipsin over the bridge agin Wickendens doorstones Twadnt the
new County Council bridge with the handrail They hadnt given it in for
a public right o way then Twas just a bit o lathy old plank which
Jim had throwed acrost the brook for his own conveniences The man
wasnt drunkonly a little concerned in liquor likean his back was
a mask where hed slipped in the muck comin along He went up the
bricks past Jims mother which was feedin the ducks an set himself
down at the table insideJim was just changin his socksan the man
let Jim know all his rights and aims regardin Mary Then there just
about was a hurlybulloo Jims fust mind was to pitch him forth but
hed done that once in his young days and got six months up to Lewes
jail along o the man fallin on his head So he swallowed his spittle
an let him talk The law about Mary was on the mans side from fust
to last for he showed us all the papers Then Mary come
downstairsshed been studyin for an examinationan the man tells
her who he was an she says he had ought to have took proper care of
his own flesh and blood while he had it by him an not to think he
could reeclaim it when it suited He says somethin or other but she
looks him up an down front an backwent an she just tongues him
scadderin out o doors and he went away stuffin all the papers back
into his hat talkin most abusefully Then she come back an freed her
mind against Jim an his mother for not havin warned her of her
upbringins which it come out she hadnt ever been told They didnt
say naun to her They never did Id ha packed her off with any man
that would ha took heran Gods pity on him

Umm said Jabez and sucked his pipe

So then that was the beginnin The man come back again next week or
so an he catched Jim alone thout his mother this time an he fair
beazled him with his papers an his talkfor the law was on his
sidetill Jim went down into his moneypurse an give him ten shillings
hushmoneyhe told meto withdraw away for a bit an leave Mary
with em

But thats no way to get rid o man or woman Jabez said

No more tis I told Jim so What can I do Jim says The laws
with the man I walk about daytimes thinkin o it till I sweats my
underclothes wringin an I lie abed nights thinkin o it till I
sweats my sheets all of a sop Tisnt as if I was a young man he
says nor yet as if I was a pore man Maybe hell drink hisself to
death I een amost told him outright what foolishness he was enterin
into but he knowed ithe knowed itbecause he said next time the man
come twould be fifteen shillins An next time twas Just fifteen
shillins

An was the man her father asked Jabez

He had the proofs an the papers Jim showed me what that Lunnon
Childerns Society had answered when Mary writ up to em an taxed em
with it I lay she hadnt been proper polite in her letters to em for
they answered middlin short They said the matter was out o their
hands butlets see if I rememberoh yesthey reegretted there
had been an oversight I reckon they had sent Mary out in the candlebox
as a orphan instead o havin a father Terrible awkward Then when
hed drinked up the money the man come againin his usualsan he
kept hammerin on and hammerin on about his duty to his pore dear wife
an what hed do for his dear daughter in Lunnon till the tears runned
down his two dirty cheeks an he come away with more money Jim used to
slip it into his hand behind the door but his mother she heard the
chink She didnt hold with hushmoney Shed write out all her feelins
on the slate an Jim ud be settin up half the night answerin back
an showing that the man had the law with him

Hadnt that man no trade nor business then

He told me he was a printer I reckon though he lived on the rates
like the rest of em up there in Lunnon

An how did Mary take it

She said shed sooner go into service than go with the man I reckon a
mistress ud be middlin put to it for a maid fore she put Mary into
cap an gown She was studyin to be a schoooolteacher A beauty
shell make Well that was how things went that fall Marys Lunnon
father kep comin an comin carden as hed drinked out the money Jim
gave him an each time hed putup his price for not takin Mary away
Jims mother she didnt like partin with no money an bein obliged
to write her feelins on the slate instead o givin em vent by mouth
she was just about mad Just about she was mad

Come November I lodged with Jim in the outside room over gainst his
henhouse I paid her my rent I was workin for Dockett at
Poundsgettin chestnutbats out o Perry Shaw Just such weather as
this berain atop o rain after a wet October An I remember it ended
in dry frostes right away up to Christmas Dockett hed sent up to
Perry Shaw for meno he comes puffin up to me himselfbecause a big
cornerpiece o the bank had slipped into the brook where she makes that
elber at the bottom o the Seventeen Acre an all the rubbishy alders
an sallies which he ought to have cut out when he took the farm
theyd slipped with the slip an the brook was comin rooshin down
atop of em an theyd just about back an spill the waters over his
winter wheat The water was lyin in the flats already Gor amighty
Jesse he bellers out at me get that rubbish away all manners you
can Dont stop for no fagottin but give the brook play or my wheats
past salvation I cant lend you no help he says but work an
Ill pay ye

You had him there Jabez chuckled

Yes I reckon I had ought to have drove my bargain but the brook was
backin up on good breadcorn So cardenly I laid into the mess of it
workin off the bank where the trees was drownin themselves headdown
in the rooshjust such weather as thisan the brook creepin up on me
all the time Long toward noon Jim comes mowchin along with his
toppin axe over his shoulder

Be you minded for an extra hand at your job he says

Be you minded to turn to I ses anno more talk to itJim laid in
alongside o me Hes no hunger with a toppin axe

Maybe but Ive seed him at a job o throwin in the woods an he
didnt seem to make out no shape said Jabez He havent got the
shoulders nor yet the judgmentmy opinionwhen hes dealin with
fullgirt timber He dont rightly make up his mind where hes goin to
throw her

We wasnt throwin nothin We was cuttin out they soft alders an
haulin em up the bank fore they could back the waters on the wheat
Jim didnt say much less it was that hed had a postcard from Marys
Lunnon father night before sayin he was comin down that mornin
Jim hed sweated all night an he didnt reckon hisself equal to the
talkin an the swearin an the cryin an his mother blamin him
afterwards on the slate It spiled my day to think of it he ses when
we was eatin our pieces So Ive fair cried dunghill an run
Motherll have to tackle him by herself I lay she wont give him no
hushmoney he ses I lay hell be surprised by the time hes done
with her he ses An that was een amost all the talk we had
concernin it But hes no hunger with the toppin axe

The brook shed crep up an up on us an she kep creepin upon us
till we was workin kneedeep in the shallers cuttin an pookin an
pullin what we could get to o the rubbish There was a middlin lot
comin downstream toocattlebars an hoppoles and oddsends bats
all poltin down together but they rooshed round the elber good shape
by the time wed backed out they drowned trees Come four oclock we
reckoned wed done a proper days work an shed take no harm if we
left her We couldnt puddle about there in the dark an wet to no more
advantage Jim he was pourin the water out of his bootsno I was
doin that Jim was kneelin to unlace hisn Damn it all Jesse he
ses standin up the flood must be over my doorsteps at home for here
comes my old whitetop beeskep

Yes I allus heard he paints his beeskeps Jabez put in I dunno
paint dont tarrify bees moren it keeps em dry

Ill have a pook at it he ses an he pooks at it as it comes round
the elber The roosh nigh jerked the pooker out of his handgrips an
he calls to me an I come runnin barefoot Then we pulled on the
pooker an it reared up on eend in the roosh an we guessed what
twas Cardenly we pulled it in into a shaller an it rolled a piece
an a great old stiff mans arm nigh hit me in the face Then we was
sure Tis a man ses Jim But the face was all a mask I reckon its
Marys Lunnon father he ses presently Lend me a match and Ill make
sure He never used baccy We lit three matches one by another wells
we could in the rain an he cleaned off some o the slob with a tussick
o grass Yes he ses Its Marys Lunnon father He wont tarrify us
no more Dyou want him Jesse he ses

No I ses If this was Eastbourne beach like hed be halfacrown
apiece to us fore the coroner but now wed only lose a day havin to
tend the inquest I lay he fell into the brook

I lay he did ses Jim I wonder if he saw mother He turns him
over an opens his coat and puts his fingers in the waistcoat pocket
an starts laughin Hes seen mother right enough he ses An hes
got the best of her too She wont be able to crow no more over me
bout givin him money I never give him more than a sovereign Shes
give him two an he trousers em laughin all the time An now
well pook him back again for Ive done with him he ses

So we pooked him back into the middle of the brook an we saw he went
round the elber thout balkin an we walked quite a piece beside of
him to set him on his ways When we couldnt see no more we went home
by the high road because we knowed the brook ud be out acrost the
medders an we wasnt goin to hunt for Jims little rotten old bridge
in that darkan rainin Heavens hard too I was middlin pleased to
see light an vittles again when we got home Jim he pressed me to come
insides for a drink He dont drink in a generality but he was rid of
all his troubles that evenin dye see Mother he ses so soon as the
door oped have you seen him She whips out her slate an writes
downNo Oh no ses Jim You dont get out of it that way
mother I lay you have seen him an I lay hes bested you for all
your talk same as he bested me Make a clean breast of it mother he
ses He got round you too She was goin for the slate again but he
stops her Its all right mother he ses Ive seen him sense you
have an he wont trouble us no more The old lady looks up quick as a
robin an she writes Did he say so No ses Jim laughin He
didnt say so Thats how I know But he bested you mother You cant
have it in at me for bein softhearted Youre twice as
tenderhearted as what I be Look he ses an he shows her the two
sovereigns Put em away where they belong he ses He wont never
come for no more an now well have our drink he ses for weve
earned it

Natureally they werent goin to let me see where they kep their
monies She went upstairs with itfor the whisky

I never knowed Jim was a drinkin manin his own house like said
Jabez

No more he isnt but what he takes he likes good He wont tech no
publicans hogwash acrost the bar Four shillins he paid for that
bottle o whisky I know because when the old lady brought it down
there wasnt moren jest a liddle few dreenins an dregs in it Nothin
to set before neighbours I do assure you

Why twas half full last week mother he ses You dont mean he
ses youve given him all that as well Its two shillins worth he
ses Thats how I knowed he paid four Well well mother you be too
tendercarted to live But I dont grudge it to him he ses I dont
grudge him nothin he can keep So cardenly we drinked up what
little sup was left

An what come to Marys Lunnon father said Jabez after a full
minutes silence

I be too tired to go readin papers of evenins but Dockett he told
me that very week I think that theyd inquested on a man down at
Robertsbridge which had poked and poked up agin so many bridges an
banks like they couldnt make naun out of him

An what did Mary say to all these doins

The old lady bundled her off to the village fore her Lunnon father
come to buy weekend stuff an she forgot the half o it When we
come in she was upstairs studyin to be a schoolteacher None told her
naun about it Twadnt girls affairs

Reckon she knowed Jabez went on

She She must have guessed it middlin close when she saw her money
come back But she never mentioned it in writing so fars I know She
were more worritted that night on account of twothree her chickens
bein drowned for the flood had skewed their old henhouse round on her
postes I cobbled her up next mornin when the brook shrinked

An where did you find the bridge Some fur downstream didnt ye

Just where she allus was She hadnt shifted but very little The brook
had gulled out the bank a piece under one eend o the plank sos she
was liable to tilt ye sideways if you wasnt careful But I pooked
threefour bricks under her an she was all plumb again

Well I dunno how it looks like but let be how twill said Jabez
he hadnt no business to come down from Lunnon tarrifyin people an
threatenin to take away children which theyd hobbed up for their
lawful owneven if twas Mary Wickenden

He had the business right enough an he had the law with himno
gettin over that said Jesse But he had the drink with him too an
that was where he failed like

Well well Let be how twill the brook was a good friend to Jim I
see it now I allus did wonder what he was gettin at when he said
that when I talked to him about shiftin the stack You dunno
everythin he ses The Brooks been a good friend to me he ses
an if shes minded to have a snatch at my hay I aint settin out
to withstand her

I reckon shes about shifted it too by now Jesse chuckled Hark
That aint any slip off the bank which shes got hold of

The Brook had changed her note again It sounded as though she were
mumbling something soft




     THE LAND

     When Julius Fabricius SubPrefect of the Weald
     In the days of Diocletian owned our Lower Riverfield
     He called to him Hobdeniusa Briton of the Clay
     Saying What about that Riverpiece for layin in to hay

     And the aged Hobden answered I remember as a lad
     My father told your father that she wanted dreenin bad
     An the more that you neeglect her the less youll get her clean
     Have it jest as youve a mind to but if I was you Id dreen

     So they drained it long and crossways in the lavish Roman style
     Still we find among the riverdrift their flakes of ancient tile
     And in drouthy middle August when the bones of meadows show
     We can trace the lines they followed sixteen hundred years ago

     Then Julius Fabricius died as even Prefects do
     And after certain centuries Imperial Rome died too
     Then did robbers enter Britain from across the Northern main
     And our Lower Riverfield was won by Ogier the Dane

     Well could Ogier work his warboatwell could Ogier wield
          his brand
     Much he knew of foaming watersnot so much of farming land
     So he called to him a Hobden of the old unaltered blood
     Saying What about that Riverbit she doesnt look no good

     And that aged Hobden answered Taint for me to interfere
     But Ive known that bit o meadow now for five and fifty year
     Have it jest as youve a mind to but Ive proved it time
          on time
     If you want to change her nature you have got to give her lime

     Ogier sent his wains to Lewes twenty hours solemn walk
     And drew back great abundance of the cool grey healing chalk
     And old Hobden spread it broadcast never heeding what was int
     Which is why in cleaning ditches now and then we find a flint

     Ogier died His sons grew English AngloSaxon was their name
     Till out of blossomed Normandy another pirate came
     For Duke William conquered England and divided with his men
     And our Lower Riverfield he gave to William of Warenne

     But the Brook you know her habit rose one rainy Autumn night
     And tore down sodden flitches of the bank to left and right
     So said William to his Bailiff as they rode their dripping rounds
     Hob what about that Riverbitthe Brooks got up no bounds

     And that aged Hobden answered Taint my business to advise
     But ye might ha known twould happen from the way the valley lies
     When ye cant hold back the water you must try and save the sile
     Hev it jest as youve a mind to but if I was you Id spile

     They spiled along the watercourse with trunks of willowtrees
     And planks of elms behind em and immortal oaken knees
     And when the spates of Autumn whirl the gravelbeds away
     You can see their faithful fragments ironhard in iron clay

                                   

     Georgii Quinti Anno Sexto I who own the Riverfield
     Am fortified with titledeeds attested signed and sealed
     Guaranteeing me my assigns my executors and heirs
     All sorts of powers and profits whichare neither mine nor theirs

     I have rights of chase and warren as my dignity requires
     I can fishbut Hobden tickles I can shootbut Hobden wires
     I repair but he reopens certain gaps which men allege
     Have been used by every Hobden since a Hobden swapped a hedge

     Shall I dog his morning progress oer the trackbetraying dew
     Demand his dinnerbasket into which my pheasant flew
     Confiscate his evening faggot into which the conies ran
     And summons him to judgment I would sooner summons Pan

     His dead are in the churchyardthirty generations laid
     Their names went down in Domesday Book when Domesday Book was made
     And the passion and the piety and prowess of his line
     Have seeded rooted fruited in some land the Law calls mine

     Not for any beast that burrows not for any bird that flies
     Would I lose his large sound council miss his keen amending eyes
     He is bailiff woodman wheelwright fieldsurveyor engineer
     And if flagrantly a poachertaint for me to interfere

     Hob what about that Riverbit I turn to him again
     With Fabricius and Ogier and William of Warenne
     Hev it jest as youve a mind to butand so he takes command
     For whoever pays the taxes old Mus Hobden owns the land



In the Same Boat



A throbbing vein said Dr Gilbert soothingly is the mother of
delusion

Then how do you account for my knowing when the thing is due Conroys
voice rose almost to a break

Of course but you should have consulted a doctor before
usingpalliatives

It was driving me mad And now I cant give them up

Not so bad as that One doesnt form fatal habits at twentyfive
Think again Were you ever frightened as a child

I dont remember It began when I was a boy

With or without the spasm By the way do you mind describing the spasm
again

Well said Conroy twisting in the chair Im no musician but
suppose you were a violinstringvibratingand some one put his finger
on you As if a finger were put on the naked soul Awful

Sos indigestionsos nightmarewhile it lasts

But the horror afterwards knocks me out for days And the waiting for
it  and then this drug habit It cant go on He shook as he spoke
and the chair creaked

My dear fellow said the doctor when youre older youll know what
burdens the best of us carry A fox to every Spartan

That doesnt help me I cant I cant cried Conroy and burst into
tears

Dont apologise said Gilbert when the paroxysm ended Im used to
people coming a littleunstuck in this room

Its those tabloids Conroy stamped his foot feebly as he blew his
nose Theyve knocked me out I used to be fit once Oh Ive tried
exercise and everything Butif one sits down for a minute when its
dueeven at four in the morningit runs up behind one

Yees Many things come in the quiet of the morning You always know
when the visitation is due

What would I give not to be sure he sobbed

Well put that aside for the moment Im thinking of a case where what
well call anmia of the brain was masked I dont say cured by
vibration He couldnt sleep or thought he couldnt but a steamer
voyage and the thump of the screw

A steamer After what Ive told you Conroy almost shrieked Id
sooner 

Of course not a steamer in your case but a long railway journey the
next time you think it will trouble you It sounds absurd but

Id try anything I nearly have Conroy sighed

Nonsense Ive given you a tonic that will clear that notion from
your head Give the train a chance and dont begin the journey by
bucking yourself up with tabloids Take them along but hold them in
reservein reserve

Dyou think Ive selfcontrol enough after what youve heard said
Conroy

Dr Gilbert smiled Yes After what Ive seen he glanced round the
room I have no hesitation in saying you have quite as much
selfcontrol as many other people Ill write you later about your
journey Meantime the tonic and he gave some general directions
before Conroy left

An hour later Dr Gilbert hurried to the links where the others of his
regular weekend game awaited him It was a rigid round played as usual
at the trot for the tension of the week lay as heavy on the two Kings
Counsels and Sir John Chartres as on Gilbert The lawyers were old
enemies of the Admiralty Court and Sir John of the frosty eyebrows and
Abernethy manner was bracketed with but before Rutherford Gilbert
among nervespecialists

At the Clubhouse afterwards the lawyers renewed their squabble over a
tangled collision case and the doctors as naturally compared
professional matters

Liesall lies said Sir John when Gilbert had told him Conroys
trouble Post hoc propter hoc The man or woman who drugs is ipso
facto a liar Youve no imagination

Pity you havent a littleoccasionally

I have believed a certain type of patient in my time Its always the
same For reasons not given in the consultingroom they take to the
drug Certain symptoms follow They will swear to you and believe it
that they took the drug to mask the symptoms What does your man use
Najdolene I thought so I had practically the duplicate of your case
last Thursday Same old Najdolenesame old lie

Tell me the symptoms and Ill draw my own inferences Johnnie

Symptoms The girl was rank poisoned with Najdolene Ramping stamping
possession Gad I thought shed have the chandelier down

Mine came unstuck too and he has the physique of a bull said
Gilbert What delusions had yours

Facesfaces with mildew on them In any other walk of life wed call
it the Horrors She told me of course she took the drugs to mask the
faces Post hoc propter hoc again All liars

Whats that said the senior KC quickly Sounds professional

Go away Not for you Sandy Sir John turned a shoulder against him
and walked with Gilbert in the chill evening

To Conroy in his chambers came one week later this letter

     DEAR MR CONROYIf your plan of a nights trip on the th
     still holds good and you have no particular destination in
     view you could do me a kindness A Miss Henschil in whom I
     am interested goes down to the West by the  from
     Waterloo Number  platform on that night She is not
     exactly an invalid but like so many of us a little shaken
     in her nerves Her maid of course accompanies her but if I
     knew you were in the same train it would be an additional
     source of strength Will you please write and let me know
     whether the  from Waterloo Number  platform on the
     th suits you and I will meet you there Dont forget my
     caution and keep up the tonicYours sincerely

     L RUTHERFORD GILBERT

He knows Im scarcely fit to look after myself was Conroys thought
And he wants me to look after a woman

Yet at the end of half an hours irresolution he accepted

Now Conroys trouble which had lasted for years was this

On a certain night while he lay between sleep and wake he would be
overtaken by a long shuddering sigh which he learned to know was the
sign that his brain had once more conceived its horror and in timein
due timewould bring it forth

Drugs could so well veil that horror that it shuffled along no worse
than as a freezing dream in a procession of disorderly dreams but over
the return of the event drugs had no control Once that sigh had passed
his lips the thing was inevitable and through the days granted before
its rebirth he walked in torment For the first two years he had striven
to fend it off by distractions but neither exercise nor drink availed
Then he had come to the tabloids of the excellent M Najdol These
guarantee on the label Refreshing and absolutely natural sleep to the
soulweary They are carried in a case with a spring which presses one
scented tabloid to the end of the tube whence it can be lipped off in
stroking the moustache or adjusting the veil

Three years of M Najdols preparations do not fit a man for many
careers His friends who knew he did not drink assumed that Conroy had
strained his heart through valiant outdoor exercises and Conroy had
with some care invented an imaginary doctor symptoms and regimen
which he discussed with them and with his mother in Hereford She
maintained that he would grow out of it and recommended nux vomica

When at last Conroy faced a real doctor it was he hoped to be saved
from suicide by a straitwaistcoat Yet Dr Gilbert had but given him
more drugsa tonic for instance that would couple railway
carnagesand had advised a night in the train Not alone the horrors of
a railway journey for which a man who dare keep no servant must een
pack label and address his own bag but the necessity for holding
himself in hand before a stranger a little shaken in her nerves

He spent a long forenoon packing because when he assembled and counted
things his mind slid off to the hours that remained of the day before
his night and he found himself counting minutes aloud At such times
the injustice of his fate would drive him to revolts which no servant
should witness but on this evening Dr Gilberts tonic held him fairly
calm while he put up his patent razors

Waterloo Station shook him into real life The change for his ticket
needed concentration if only to prevent shillings and pence turning
into minutes at the bookingoffice and he spoke quickly to a porter
about the disposition of his bag The old  from Waterloo to the West
was an allnight caravan that halted in the interests of the milk
traffic at almost every station

Dr Gilbert stood by the door of the one composite corridorcoach an
older and stouter man behind him So glad youre here he cried Let
me get your ticket

Certainly not Conroy answered I got it myselflong ago My bags
in too he added proudly

I beg your pardon Miss Henschils here Ill introduce you

Butbut he stammeredthink of the state Im in If anything
happens I shall collapse

Not you Youd rise to the occasion like a bird And as for the
selfcontrol you were talking of the other dayGilbert swung him
roundlook

A young man in an ulster over a silkfaced frockcoat stood by the
carriage window weeping shamelessly

Oh but thats only drink Conroy said I havent had one of mymy
things since lunch

Excellent said Gilbert I knew I could depend on you Come along
Wait for a minute Chartres

A tall woman veiled sat by the far window She bowed her head as the
doctor murmured Conroy knew not what Then he disappeared and the
inspector came for tickets

My maidnext compartment she said slowly

Conroy showed his ticket but in returning it to the sleevepocket of
his ulster the little silver Najdolene case slipped from his glove and
fell to the floor He snatched it up as the moving train flung him
into his seat

How nice said the woman She leisurely lifted her veil unbottoned
the first button of her left glove and pressed out from its palm a
Najdolenecase

Dont said Conroy not realising he had spoken

I beg your pardon The deep voice was measured even and low Conroy
knew what made it so

I said dont He wouldnt like you to do it

No he would not She held the tube with its everpresented tabloid
between finger and thumb But arent you one of theahsoulweary
too

Thats why Oh please dont Not at first II havent had one since
morning Youyoull set me off

You Are you so far gone as that

He nodded pressing his palms together The train jolted through
Vauxhall points and was welcomed with the clang of empty milkcans
for the West

After long silence she lifted her great eyes and with an innocence
that would have deceived any sound man asked Conroy to call her maid to
bring her a forgotten book

Conroy shook his head No Our sort cant read Dont

Were you sent to watch me The voice never changed

Me I need a keeper myself much morethis night of all

This night Have you a night then They disbelieved me when I told
them of mine She leaned back and laughed always slowly Arent
doctors stuupid They dont know

She leaned her elbow on her knee lifted her veil that had fallen and
chin in hand stared at him He looked at hertill his eyes were
blurred with tears

Have I been there think you she said

Surelysurely Conroy answered for he had well seen the fear and the
horror that lived behind the heavylidded eyes the fine tracing on the
broad forehead and the guard set about the desirable mouth

Thensuppose we have onejust one apiece Ive gone without since
this afternoon

He put up his hand and would have shouted but his voice broke

Dont Cant you see that it helps me to help you to keep it off Dont
lets both go down together

But I want one Its a poor heart that never rejoices Just one Its
my night

Its minetoo My sixtyfourth fifth sixth seventh He shut his
lips firmly against the tide of visualised numbers that threatened to
carry him along

Ah its only my thirtyninth She paused as he had done I wonder if
I shall last into the sixties Talk to me or I shall go crazy Youre
a man Youre the stronger vessel Tell me when you went to pieces

One two three four five six seveneightI beg your pardon

Not in the least I always pretend Ive dropped a stitch of my
knitting I count the days till the last day then the hours then the
minutes Do you

I dont think Ive done very much else for the last said Conroy
shivering for the night was cold with a chill he recognised

Oh how comforting to find some one who can talk sense Its not always
the same date is it

What difference would that make He unbuttoned his ulster with a jerk
Youre a sane woman Cant you see the wickedwickedwicked dust
flew from the padded armrest as he struck it unfairness of it What
have I done

She laid her large hand on his shoulder very firmly

If you begin to think over that she said youll go to pieces and be
ashamed Tell me yours and Ill tell you mine Only be quietbe quiet
lad or youll set me off She made shift to soothe him though her
chin trembled

Well said he at last picking at the armrest between them mines
nothing much of course

Dont be a fool Thats for doctorsand mothers

Its Hell Conroy muttered It begins on a steameron a stifling hot
night I come out of my cabin I pass through the saloon where the
stewards have rolled up the carpets and the boards are bare and hot
and soapy

Ive travelled too she said

Ah I come on deck I walk down a covered alleyway Butchers meat
bananas oil that sort of smell

Again she nodded

Its a leadcoloured steamer and the seas leadcoloured Perfectly
smooth seaperfectly still ship except for the engines running and
her waves going off in lines and lines and linesdull grey All this
time I know somethings going to happen

I know Something going to happen she whispered

Then I hear a thud in the engineroom Then the noise of machinery
falling downlike fireironsand then two most awful yells Theyre
more like hoots and I knowI know while I listenthat it means that
two men have died as they hooted It was their last breath hooting out
of themin most awful pain Do you understand

I ought to Go on

Thats the first part Then I hear bare feet running along the
alleyway One of the scalded men comes up behind me and says quite
distinctly My friend All is lost Then he taps me on the shoulder
and I hear him drop down dead He panted and wiped his forehead

So that is your night she said

That is my night It comes every few weeksso many days after I get
what I call sentence Then I begin to count

Get sentence Dyou mean this She half closed her eyes drew a
deep breath and shuddered Notice I call it Sir John thought it was
all lies

She had unpinned her hat and thrown it on the seat opposite showing the
immense mass of her black hair rolled low in the nape of the columnar
neck and looped over the left ear But Conroy had no eyes except for her
grave eyes

Listen now said she I walk down a road a white sandy road near the
sea There are broken fences on either side and Men come and look at me
over them

Just men Do they speak

They try to Their faces are all mildewyeaten away and she hid her
face for an instant with her left hand Its the Facesthe Faces

Yes Like my two hoots I know

Ah But the place itselfthe barenessand the glitter and the salt
smells and the wind blowing the sand The Men run after me and I
run I know whats coming too One of them touches me

Yes What comes then Weve both shirked that

One awful shocknot palpitation but shock shock shock

As though your soul were being stoppedas youd stop a fingerbowl
humming he said

Just that she answered Ones very soulthe soul that one lives
bystopped So

She drove her thumb deep into the armrest And now she whined to
him now that weve stirred each other up this way mightnt we have
just one

No said Conroy shaking Lets hold on Were pasthe peered out
of the black windowsWoking Theres the Necropolis How long
till dawn

Oh cruel long yet If one dozes for a minute it catches one

And how dyou find that thishe tapped the palm of his glovehelps
you

It covers up the thing from being too realif one takes enoughyou
know Onlyonlyone loses everything else Ive been no more than a
bogiegirl for two years What would you give to be real again This
lyings such a nuisance

One must protect oneselfand theres ones mother to think of he
answered

True I hope allowances are made for us somewhere Our burdencan you
hearour burden is heavy enough

She rose towering into the roof of the carriage Conroys ungentle grip
pulled her back

Now you are foolish Sit down said he

But the cruelty of it Cant you see it Dont you feel it Lets take
one nowbefore I

Sit down cried Conroy and the sweat stood again on his forehead He
had fought through a few nights and had been defeated on more and he
knew the rebellion that flares beyond control to exhaustion

She smoothed her hair and dropped back but for a while her head and
throat moved with the sickening motion of a captured wryneck

Once she said spreading out her hands I ripped my counterpane
from end to end That takes strength I had it then Ive little now
All dorn as my little niece says And you lad

All dorn Let me keep your case for you till the morning

But the cold feeling is beginning

Lend it me then

And the drag down my right side I shant be able to move in a minute

I can scarcely lift my arm myself said Conroy Were in for it

Then why are you so foolish You know itll be easier if we have only
oneonly one apiece

She was lifting the case to her mouth With tremendous effort Conroy
caught it The two moved like jointed dolls and when their hands met it
was as wood on wood

You mustnot said Conroy His jaws stiffened and the cold climbed
from his feet up

WhymustInot She repeated the words idiotically

Conroy could only shake his head while he bore down on the hand and the
case in it

Her speech went from her altogether The wonderful lips rested half over
the even teeth the breath was in the nostrils only the eyes dulled
the face set grey and through the glove the hand struck like ice

Presently her soul came back and stood behind her eyesonly thing that
had life in all that placestood and looked for Conroys soul He too
was fettered in every limb but somewhere at an immense distance he
heard his heart going about its work as the engineroom carries on
through and beneath the all but overwhelming wave His one hope he
knew was not to lose the eyes that clung to his because there was an
Evil abroad which would possess him if he looked aside by a
hairbreadth

The rest was darkness through which some distant planet spun while
cymbals clashed Beyond Farnborough the  rolls out many empty
milkcans at every halt Then a body came to life with intolerable
pricklings Limb by limb after agonies of terror that body returned to
him steeped in most perfect physical weariness such as follows a long
days rowing He saw the heavy lids droop over her eyesthe watcher
behind them departedand his soul sinking into assured peace
Conroy slept

Light on his eyes and a salt breath roused him without shock Her hand
still held his She slept forehead down upon it but the movement of
his waking waked her too and she sneezed like a child

II think its morning said Conroy

And nothing has happened Did you see your Men I didnt see my Faces
Does it mean weve escaped Diddid you take any after I went to sleep
Ill swear I didnt she stammered

No there wasnt any need Weve slept through it

No need Thank God There was no need Oh look

The train was running under red cliffs along a seawall washed by waves
that were colourless in the early light Southward the sun rose mistily
upon the Channel

She leaned out of the window and breathed to the bottom of her lungs
while the wind wrenched down her dishevelled hair and blew it below
her waist

Well she said with splendid eyes Arent you still waiting for
something to happen

No Not till next time Weve been let off Conroy answered breathing
as deeply as she

Then we ought to say our prayers

What nonsense Some one will see us

We neednt kneel Stand up and say Our Father We must

It was the first time since childhood that Conroy had prayed They
laughed hysterically when a curve threw them against an armrest

Now for breakfast she cried My maidNurse Blaberhas the basket
and things Itll be ready in twenty minutes Oh Look at my hair and
she went out laughing

Conroys first discovery made without fumbling or counting letters on
taps was that the London and South Westerns allowance of washingwater
is inadequate He used every drop rioting in the cold tingle on neck
and arms To shave in a moving train balked him but the next halt gave
him a chance which to his own surprise he took As he stared at
himself in the mirror he smiled and nodded There were points about this
person with the clear if sunken eye and the almost uncompressed mouth
But when he bore his bag back to his compartment the weight of it on a
limp arm humbled that new pride

My friend he said half aloud you go into training Youre putty

She met him in the spare compartment where her maid had laid breakfast

By Jove he said halting at the doorway I hadnt realised how
beautiful you were

The same to you lad Sit down I could eat a horse

I shouldnt said the maid quietly The less you eat the better She
was a small freckled woman with light fluffy hair and paleblue eyes
that looked through all veils

This is Miss Blaber said Miss Henschil Hes one of the soulweary
too Nursey

I know it But when one has just given it up a full meal doesnt agree
Thats why Ive only brought you bread and butter

She went out quietly and Conroy reddened

Were still children you see said Miss Henschil But Im well
enough to feel some shame of it Dyou take sugar

They starved together heroically and Nurse Blaber was good enough to
signify approval when she came to clear away

Nursey Miss Henschil insinuated and flushed

Do you smoke said the nurse coolly to Conroy

I havent in years Now you mention it I think Id like a
cigaretteor something

I used to Dyou think it would keep me quiet Miss Henschil said

Perhaps Try these The nurse handed them her cigarettecase

Dont take anything else she commanded and went away with the
teabasket

Good grunted Conroy between mouthfuls of tobacco

Better than nothing said Miss Henschil but for a while they felt
ashamed yet with the comfort of children punished together

Now she whispered who were you when you were a man

Conroy told her and in return she gave him her history It delighted
them both to deal once more in worldly concernsfamilies names
places and dateswith a person of understanding

She came she said of Lancashire folkwealthy cottonspinners who
still kept the broadened a and slurred aspirate of the old stock She
lived with an old masterful mother in an opulent world north of
Lancaster Gate where people in Society gave parties at a Mecca called
the Langham Hotel

She herself had been launched into Society there and the flowers at the
ball had cost eightyseven pounds but being reckoned peculiar she had
made few friends among her own sex She had attracted many men for she
was a beautythe beauty in fact of Society she said

She spoke utterly without shame or reticence as a lifeprisoner tells
his past to a fellowprisoner and Conroy nodded across the smokerings

Do you remember when you got into the carriage she asked Oh I
wish I had some knitting Did you notice aught lad

Conroy thought back It was ages since Wasnt there some one outside
the doorcrying he asked

Heshes the little man I was engaged to she said But I made him
break it off I told him twas no good But he wont yo see

That fellow Why he doesnt come up to your shoulder

Thats naught to do with it I think all the world of him Im a
foolish wenchher speech wandered as she settled herself cosily one
elbow on the armrest Wed been engagedI couldnt help thatand he
worships the ground I tread on But its no use Im not responsible
you see His two sisters are against it though Ive the money Theyre
right but they think its the driink she drawled Theyre
Methodythe Skinners You see their grandfather that started the
Patton Mills he died o the driink

I see said Conroy The grave face before him under the lifted veil
was troubled

George Skinner She breathed it softly Id make him a good wife by
Gods graaceif I could But its no use Im not responsible But
hell not take No for an answer I used to call him Toots Hes of
no consequence yo see

Thats in Dickens said Conroy quite quickly I havent thought of
Toots for years He was at Doctor Blimbers

And sothats my trouble she concluded ever so slightly wringing
her hands But Idont you thinktheres hope now

Eh said Conroy Oh yes This is the first time Ive turned my corner
without help With your help I should say

Itll come back though

Then shall we meet it in the same way Heres my card Write me your
train and well go together

Yes We must do that But between timeswhen we want She looked at
her palm the four fingers working on it Its hard to give em up

But think what we have gained already and let me have the case to
keep

She shook her head and threw her cigarette out of the window Not
yet

Then lets lend our cases to Nurse and well get through today on
cigarettes Ill call her while we feel strong

She hesitated but yielded at last and Nurse accepted the offerings
with a smile

Youll be all right she said to Miss Henschil But if I were
youto ConroyId take strong exercise

When they reached their destination Conroy set himself to obey Nurse
Blaber He had no remembrance of that day except one streak of blue sea
to his left gorsebushes to his right and before him a coastguards
track marked with whitewashed stones that he counted up to the far
thousands As he returned to the little town he saw Miss Henschil on the
beach below the cliffs She kneeled at Nurse Blabers feet weeping
and pleading

                                   

Twentyfive days later a telegram came to Conroys rooms Notice
given Waterloo again Twentyfourth That same evening he was wakened
by the shudder and the sigh that told him his sentence had gone forth
Yet he reflected on his pillow that he had in spite of lapses snatched
something like three weeks of life which included several rides on a
horse before breakfastthe hour one most craves Najdolene five
consecutive evenings on the river at Hammersmith in a tub where he had
well stretched the white arms that passing crews mocked at a game of
rackets at his club three dinners one small dance and one human
flirtation with a human woman More notable still he had settled his
months accounts only once confusing petty cash with the days of grace
allowed him Next morning he rode his hired beast in the park
victoriously He saw Miss Henschil on horseback near Lancaster Gate
talking to a young man at the railings

She wheeled and cantered toward him

By Jove How well you look he cried without salutation I didnt
know you rode

I used to once she replied Im all soft now

They swept off together down the ride

Your beast pulls he said

Waant him to Gigives me something to think of Howve you been
she panted I wish chemists shops hadnt red lights

Have you slipped out and bought some then

You dont know Nursey Eh but its good to be on a horse again This
chap cost me two hundred

Then youve been swindled said Conroy

I know it but its no odds I must go back to Toots and send him away
Hes neglecting his work for me

She swung her heavytopped animal on his none too sound hocks
Sentence come lad

Yes But Im not minding it so much this time

Waterloo thenand God help us She thundered back to the little
frockcoated figure that waited faithfully near the gate

Conroy felt the spring sun on his shoulders and trotted home That
evening he went out with a man in a pair oar and was rowed to a
standstill But the other man owned he could not have kept the pace five
minutes longer

                                   

He carried his bag all down Number  platform at Waterloo and hove it
with one hand into the rack

Well done said Nurse Blaber in the corridor Weve improved too

Dr Gilbert and an older man came out of the next compartment

Hallo said Gilbert Why havent you been to see me Mr Conroy Come
under the lamp Take off your hat Nono Sit you young giant Very
good Look here a minute Johnnie

A little roundbellied hawkfaced person glared at him

Gilbert was right about the beauty of the beast he muttered Dyou
keep it in your glove now he went on and punched Conroy in the
short ribs

No said Conroy meekly but without coughing Nowhereon my honour
Ive chucked it for good

Wait till you are a sound man before you say that Mr Conroy Sir
John Chartres stumped out saying to Gilbert in the corridor Its all
very fine but the question is shall I or we Sir Pandarus of Troy
become eh Were bound to think of the children

Have you been vetted said Miss Henschil a few minutes after the
train started May I sit with you II dont trust myself yet I cant
give up as easily as you can seemingly

Cant you I never saw any one so improved in a month

Look here She reached across to the rack singlehanded lifted
Conroys bag and held it at arms length I counted ten slowly And I
didnt think of hours or minutes she boasted

Dont remind me he cried

Ah Now Ive reminded myself I wish I hadnt Do you think itll be
easier for us tonight

Oh dont The smell of the carriage had brought back all his last
trip to him and Conroy moved uneasily

Im sorry Ive brought some games she went on Draughts and
cardsbut they all mean counting I wish Id brought chess but I cant
play chess What can we do Talk about something

Well hows Toots to begin with said Conroy

Why Did you see him on the platform

No Was he there I didnt notice

Oh yes He doesnt understand Hes desperately jealous I told him it
doesnt matter Will you please let me hold your hand I believe Im
beginning to get the chill

Toots ought to envy me said Conroy

He does He paid you a high compliment the other night Hes taken to
calling againin spite of all they say

Conroy inclined his head He felt cold and knew surely he would be
colder

He said she yawned Beg your pardon He said he couldnt see how I
could help falling in love with a man like you and he called himself a
damned little rat and he beat his head on the piano last night

The piano You play then

Only to him He thinks the world of my accomplishments Then I told him
I wouldnt have you if you were the last man on earth instead of only
the bestlookingnot with a million in each stocking

No not with a million in each stocking said Conroy vehemently
Isnt that odd

I suppose soto any one who doesnt know Well where was I Oh
George as good as told me I was deceiving him and he wanted to go away
without saying goodnight He hates standing atiptoe but he must if I
wont sit down

Conroy would have smiled but the chill that foreran the coming of the
LierinWait was upon him and his hand closed warningly on hers

Andand so she was trying to say when her hour also overtook her
leaving alive only the feardilated eyes that turned to Conroy Hand
froze on hand and the body with it as they waited for the horror in the
blackness that heralded it Yet through the worst Conroy saw at an
uncountable distance one minute glint of light in his night Thither
would he go and escape his fear and behold that light was the light in
the watchtower of her eyes where her locked soul signalled to his
soul Look at me

In time from him and from her the Thing sheered aside that each soul
might step down and resume its own concerns He thought confusedly of
people on the skirts of a thunderstorm withdrawing from windows where
the torn night is to their known and furnished beds Then he dozed
till in some drowsy turn his hand fell from her warmed hand

Thats all The Faces havent come he heard her say Allthank God
I dont feel even I need what Nursey promised me Do you

No He rubbed his eyes But dont make too sure

Certainly not We shall have to try again next month Im afraid it
will be an awful nuisance for you

Not to me I assure you said Conroy and they leaned back and
laughed at the flatness of the words after the hells through which they
had just risen

And now she said strict eyes on Conroy why wouldnt you take
menot with a million in each stocking

I dont know Thats what Ive been puzzling over

So have I Were as handsome a couple as Ive ever seen Are you well
off lad

They call me so said Conroy smiling

Thats North country She laughed again Setting aside my good looks
and yours Ive four thousand a year of my own and the rents should
make it six Thats a match some old cats would lap tea all night to
fettle up

It is Lucky Toots said Conroy

Ay she answered hell be the luckiest lad in London if I win
through Whos yours

Nono one dear Ive been in Hell for years I only want to get out
and be alive andso on Isnt that reason enough

Maybe for a man But I never minded things much till George came I
was all stuupid like

So was I but now I think I can live It ought to be less next month
oughtnt it he said

I hope so Yees Theres nothing much for a maid except to be married
and I ask no more Whoever yours is when youve found her she shall
have a wedding present from Mrs George Skinner that

But she wouldnt understand it any more than Toots

He doesnt matterexcept to me I cant keep my eyes open thank God
Goodnight lad

Conroy followed her with his eyes Beauty there was grace there was
strength and enough of the rest to drive better men than George Skinner
to beat their heads on pianotopsbut for the newfound life of him
Conroy could not feel one flutter of instinct or emotion that turned to
herward He put up his feet and fell asleep dreaming of a joyous
normal world recoveredwith interest on arrears There were many things
in it but no one face of any one woman

                                   

Thrice afterward they took the same train and each time their trouble
shrank and weakened Miss Henschil talked of Toots his multiplied
calls the things he had said to his sisters the much worse things his
sisters had replied of the late he seemed very dead to them M
Najdols gifts for the soulweary of shopping of house rents and the
cost of really artistic furniture and linen

Conroy explained the exercises in which he delightedmighty labours of
play undertaken against other mighty men till he sweated and having
bathed slept He had visited his mother too in Hereford and he
talked something of her and of the homelife which his body cut out of
all clean life for five years innocently and deeply enjoyed Nurse
Blaber was a little interested in Conroys mother but as a rule she
smoked her cigarette and read her paperbacked novels in her own
compartment

On their last trip she volunteered to sit with them and buried herself
in The Cloister and the Hearth while they whispered together On that
occasion it was near Salisbury at two in the morning when the
LierinWait brushed them with his wing it meant no more than that they
should cease talk for the instant and for the instant hold hands as
even utter strangers on the deep may do when their ship rolls underfoot

But still said Nurse Blaber not looking up I think your Mr
Skinner might feel jealous of all this

It would be difficult to explain said Conroy

Then youd better not be at my wedding Miss Henschil laughed

After all weve gone through too But I suppose you ought to leave me
out Is the day fixed he cried

Twentysecond of Septemberin spite of both his sisters I can risk it
now Her face was glorious as she flushed

My dear chap He shook hands unreservedly and she gave back his grip
without flinching I cant tell you how pleased I am

Gracious Heavens said Nurse Blaber in a new voice Oh I beg your
pardon I forgot I wasnt paid to be surprised

What at Oh I see Miss Henschil explained to Conroy She expected
you were going to kiss me or I was going to kiss you or something

After all youve gone through as Mr Conroy said

But I couldnt could you said Miss Henschil with a disgust as frank
as that on Conroys face It would be horriblehorrible And yet of
course youre wonderfully handsome How dyou account for it Nursey

Nurse Blaber shook her head I was hired to cure you of a habit dear
When youre cured I shall go on to the next casethat seniledecay one
at Bournemouth I told you about

And I shall be left alone with George But suppose it isnt cured
said Miss Henschil of a sudden Suppose it comes back again What can I
do I cant send for him in this way when Im a married woman She
pointed like an infant

Id come of course Conroy answered But seriously that is a
consideration

They looked at each other alarmed and anxious and then toward Nurse
Blaber who closed her book marked the place and turned to face them

Have you ever talked to your mother as you have to me she said

No I might have spoken to dadbut mothers different What dyou
mean

And youve never talked to your mother either Mr Conroy

Not till I took Najdolene Then I told her it was my heart Theres no
need to say anything now that Im practically over it is there

Not if it doesnt come back but She beckoned with a stumpy
triumphant linger that drew their heads close together You know I
always go in and read a chapter to mother at tea child

I know you do Youre an angel Miss Henschil patted the blue
shoulder next her Mothers Church of England now she explained But
shell have her Bible with her pikelets at tea every night like the
Skinners

It was Naaman and Gehazi last Tuesday that gave me a clue I said Id
never seen a case of leprosy and your mother said shed seen too many

Where She never told me Miss Henschil began

A few months before you were bornon her trip to Australiaat Mola or
Molo something or other It took me three evenings to get it all out

Aymothers suspicious of questions said Miss Henschil to Conroy
Shell lock the door of every room shes in if its but for five
minutes She was a Tackberry from Jarrow way yo see

She described your men to the lifemen with faces all eaten away
staring at her over the fence of a lepers hospital in this Molo Island
They begged from her and she ran she told me all down the street
back to the pier One touched her and she nearly fainted Shes ashamed
of that still

My men The sand and the fences Miss Henschil muttered

Yes You know how tidy she is and how she hates wind She remembered
that the fences were brokenshe remembered the wind blowing
Sandsunsalt windfencesfacesI got it all out of her bit by
bit You dont know what I know And it all happened three or four
months before you were born There Nurse Blaber slapped her knee with
her little hand triumphantly

Would that account for it Miss Henschil shook from head to foot

Absolutely I dont care who you ask You never imagined the thing It
was laid on you It happened on earth to you Quick Mr Conroy
shes too heavy for me Ill get the flask

Miss Henschil leaned forward and collapsed as Conroy told her
afterwards like a factory chimney She came out of her swoon with teeth
that chattered on the cup

Nono she said gulping Its not hysterics Yo see Ive no call
to hev em any more No callno reason whatever God be praised Cant
yo feel Im a right woman now

Stop hugging me said Nurse Blaber You dont know your strength
Finish the brandy and water Its perfectly reasonable and Ill lay
long odds Mr Conroys case is something of the same Ive been
thinking

I wonder said Conroy and pushed the girl back as she swayed again

Nurse Blaber smoothed her pale hair Yes Your trouble or something
like it happened somewhere on earth or sea to the mother who bore you
Ask her child Ask her and be done with it once for all

I will said Conroy There ought to be He opened his bag and
hunted breathlessly

Bless you Oh God bless you Nursey Miss Henschil was sobbing You
dont know what this means to me It takes it all offfrom the
beginning

But doesnt it make any difference to you now the nurse asked
curiously Now that youre rightfully a woman

Conroy busy with his bag had not heard Miss Henschil stared across
and her beauty freed from the shadow of any fear blazed up within her
I see what you mean she said But it hasnt changed anything I want
Toots He has never been out of his mind in his lifeexcept over
silly me

Its all right said Conroy stooping under the lamp
Bradshaw in hand If I change at Templecombefor Bristol
BristolHerefordyesI can be with mother for breakfast in her room
and find out

Quick then said Nurse Blaber Weve passed Gillingham quite a
while Youd better take some of our sandwiches She went out to get
them Conroy and Miss Henschil would have danced but there is no room
for giants in a SouthWestern compartment

Goodbye good luck lad Eh but youve changed alreadylike me Send
a wire to our hotel as soon as youre sure said Miss Henschil What
should I have done without you

Or I said Conroy But its Nurse thats saving us really

Then thank her said Miss Henschil looking straight at him Yes I
would Shed like it

When Nurse Blaber came back after the parting at Templecombe her nose
and her eyelids were red but for all that her face reflected a great
light even while she sniffed over The Cloister and the Hearth

Miss Henschil deep in a house furnishers catalogue did not speak for
twenty minutes Then she said between adding totals of best guest and
servants sheets But why should our times have been the same Nursey

Because a child is born somewhere every second of the clock Nurse
Blaber answered And besides that you probably set each other off by
talking and thinking about it You shouldnt you know

Ay but youve never been in Hell said Miss Henschil

The telegram handed in at Hereford at  and delivered to Miss
Henschil on the beach of a certain village at  ran thus

Absolutely confirmed She says she remembers hearing noise of
accident in engineroom returning from India eightyfive

He means the year not the thermometer said Nurse Blaber throwing
pebbles at the cold sea

And two men scalded thus explaining my hoots The idea of telling
me that Subsequently silly clergyman passenger ran up behind her
calling for joke Friend all is lost thus accounting very words

Nurse Blaber purred audibly

She says only remembers being upset minute or two Unspeakable
relief Best love Nursey who is jewel Get out of her what she would
like best Oh I oughtnt to have read that said Miss Henschil

It doesnt matter I dont want anything said Nurse Blaber and if I
did I shouldnt get it




     HELEN ALL ALONE

     There was darkness under Heaven
       For an hours space
     Darkness that we knew was given
       Us for special grace
     Sun and moon and stars were hid
       God had left His Throne
     When Helen came to me she did
       Helen all alone

     Side by side because our fate
       Damned us ere our birth
     We stole out of Limbo Gate
       Looking for the Earth
     Hand in pulling hand amid
       Fear no dreams have known
     Helen ran with me she did
       Helen all alone

     When the Horror passing speech
       Hunted us along
     Each laid hold on each and each
       Found the other strong
     In the teeth of things forbid
       And Reason overthrown
     Helen stood by me she did
       Helen all alone

     When at last we heard the Fires
       Dull and die away
     When at last our linked desires
       Dragged us up to day
     When at last our souls were rid
       Of what that Night had shown
     Helen passed from me she did
       Helen all alone

     Let her go and find a mate
       As I will find a bride
     Knowing naught of Limbo Gate
       Or Who are penned inside
     There is knowledge God forbid
       More than one should own
     So Helen went from me she did
     Oh my soul be glad she did
       Helen all alone



The Honours of War



A hooded motor had followed mine from the Guildford Road up the drive to
The Infants ancestral hall and had turned off to the stables

Were having a quiet evening together Stalkys upstairs changing
Dinners at  sharp because were hungry His rooms next to yours
said The Infant nursing a cobwebbed bottle of Burgundy

Then I found LieutenantColonel AL Corkran IA who borrowed a
collarstud and told me about the East and his Sikh regiment

And are your subalterns as good as ever I asked

Amazinsimply amazin All Ive got to do is to find em jobs They
keep touchin their caps to me and askin for more work Come at me
with their tongues hangin out I used to run the other way at
their age

And when they err said I I suppose they do sometimes

Then they run to me again to weep with remorse over their virgin
peccadilloes I never cuddled my Colonel when I was in trouble
Lambspositive lambs

And what do you say to em

Talk to em like a papa Tell em how I cant understand it an how
shocked I am and how grieved their parentsll be and throw in a
little about the Army Regulations and the Ten Commandments Makes one
feel rather a sweep when one thinks of what one used to do at their age
Dyou remember

We remembered together till close on seven oclock As we went out into
the gallery that runs round the big hall we saw The Infant below
talking to two deferential wellsetup lads whom I had known on and
off in the holidays any time for the last ten years One of them had a
bruised cheek and the other a weeping left eye

Yes thats the style said Stalky below his breath Theyre brought
up on lemonsquash and mobilisation textbooks I say the girls we knew
must have been much better than they pretended they were for Ill swear
it isnt the fathers

But why on earth did you do it The Infant was shouting You know
what it means nowadays

Well sir said Bobby Trivett the taller of the two Wontner talks
too much for one thing He didnt join till he was twentythree and
besides that he used to lecture on tactics in the anteroom He said
Clausewitz was the only tactician and he illustrated his theories with
cigarends He was that sort of chap sir

And he didnt much care whose cigarends they were said Eames who
was shorter and pinker

And then he would talk about the Varsity said Bobby He got a
degree there And he told us we werent intellectual He told the
Adjutant so sir He was just that kind of chap sir if you
understand

Stalky and I backed behind a tall Japanese jar of chrysanthemums and
listened more intently

Was all the Mess in it or only you two The Infant demanded chewing
his moustache

The Adjutant went to bed of course sir and the Senior Subaltern said
he wasnt going to risk his commissiontheyre awfully down on ragging
nowadays in the Servicebut the rest of userattended to him
said Bobby

Much The Infant asked The boys smiled deprecatingly

Not in the anteroom sir said Eames Then he called us silly
children and went to bed and we sat up discussin and I suppose we
got a bit above ourselves and weer

Went to his quarters and drew him The Infant suggested

Well we only asked him to get out of bed and we put his helmet and
swordbelt on for him and we sung him bits out of the Blue Fairy
Bookthe crambook on Army organisation Oh yes and then we asked him
to drink old Clausewitzs health as a brothertactician in milkpunch
and Worcester sauce and so on We had to help him a little there He
bites There wasnt much else that time but you know the War Office
is severe on ragging these days Bobby stopped with a lopsided smile

And then Eames went on then Wontner said wed done several pounds
worth of damage to his furniture

Oh said The Infant hes that kind of man is he Does he brush his
teeth

Oh yes hes quite clean all over said Trivett but his fathers a
wealthy barrister

Solicitor Eames corrected and so this Mister Wontner is out for our
blood Hes going to make a firstclass row about itappeal to the War
Officecourt of inquiryspicy bits in the papers and songs in the
musichalls He told us so

Thats the sort of chap he is said Trivett And that means old
Dhurrahbags our Colonel ll be put on halfpay same as that case in
the Scarifungers Mess and our Adjutantll have to exchange like it
was with that fellow in the rd Dragoons and therell be misery all
round He means making it too hot for us and his papall back him

Yes thats all very fine said The Infant but I left the Service
about the time you were born Bobby Whats it got to do with me

Father told me I was always to go to you when I was in trouble and
youve been awfully good to me since he 

Better stay to dinner The Infant mopped his forehead

Thank you very much but the fact is Trivett halted

This afternoon about four to be exact Eames broke in

We went over to Wontners quarters to talk things over The row only
happened last night and we found him writing letters as hard as he
could to his fathergetting up his case for the War Office you know
He read us some of em but Im not a good judge of style We tried to
ride him off quietlyapologies and so forthbut it was the milkpunch
and mayonnaise that defeated us

Yes he wasnt taking anything except pure revenge said Eames

He said hed make an example of the regiment and he was particularly
glad that hed landed our Colonel He told us so Old Dhurrahbags dont
sympathise with Wontners tactical lectures He says Wontner ought to
learn manners first but we thought Trivett turned to Eames who was
less a son of the house than himself Eamess father being still alive

Then Eames went on he became rather noisome and we thought we
might as well impound the correspondencehe wrinkled his swelled left
eyeand after that we got him to take a seat in my car

He was in a sack you know Trivett explained He wouldnt go any
other way But we didnt hurt him

Oh no His heads sticking out quite clear andEames rushed the
fenceweve put him in your garageer pendente lite

My garage Infants voice nearly broke with horror

Well father always told me if I was in trouble Uncle George

Bobbys sentence died away as The Infant collapsed on a divan and said
no more than Your commissions There was a long long silence

What price your latterday limejuice subaltern I whispered to
Stalky behind my hand His nostrils expanded and he drummed on the edge
of the Japanese jar with his knuckles

Confound your father Bobby The Infant groaned Raggins a criminal
offence these days It isnt as if

Come on said Stalky That was my old Line battalion in Egypt They
nearly slung old Dhurrahbags and me out of the Service in  for
ragging He descended the stairs and The Infant rolled appealing
eyes at him

I heard what you youngsters have confessed he began and in his
orderlyroom voice which is almost as musical as his singing one he
tonguelashed those lads in such sort as was a privilege and a
revelation to listen to Till then they had known him almost as a
relativewe were all brevet deputy or acting uncles to The Infants
friends brooda sympathetic elder brother sound on finance They had
never met Colonel AL Corkran in the Chair of Justice And while he
flayed and rent and blistered and wiped the floor with them and while
they looked for hidingplaces and found none on that floor I remembered
 the upending of Dolly Macshane at Dalhousie which came
perilously near a courtmartial on SecondLieutenant Corkran  the
burning of Captain Parmilees mosquitocurtains on a hot Indian dawn
when the captain slept in his garden and Lieutenant Corkran smoking
rode by after a successful whist night at the club  the
introduction of an ekka pony with ekka attached into a brother
captains tent on a frosty night in Peshawur and the removal of tent
pole cot and captain all wrapped in chilly canvas  the bath that
was given to ElliotHacker on his own verandahhis ladylove saw it and
broke off the engagement which was what the Mess intended she being an
Eurasianand the powdering all over of ElliotHacker with flour and
turmeric from the bazaar

When he took breath I realised how only Satan can rebuke sin The good
dont know enough

Now said Stalky get out No not out of the house Go to your
rooms

Ill send your dinner Bobby said The Infant Ipps

Nothing had ever been known to astonish Ipps the butler He entered and
withdrew with his charges After all he had suffered from Bobby since
Bobbys twelfth year

Theyve done everything they could short of murder said The Infant
You know what thisll mean for the regiment It isnt as if we were
dealing with Sahibs nowadays

Quite so Stalky turned on me Go and release the bagman he said

Tisnt my garage I pleaded Im company Besides hell probably
slay me Hes been in the sack for hours

Look here Stalky thunderedthe years had fallen from us bothis
youram I commandin or are you Weve got to pull this thing off
somehow or other Cut over to the garage make much of him and bring
him over Hes dining with us Be quick you dithering ass

I was quick enough but as I ran through the shrubbery I wondered how
one extricates the subaltern of the present day from a sack without
hurting his feelings Anciently one slit the end open taking off his
boots first and then fled

Imagine a sumptuouslyequipped garage halffilled by The Infants
cobaltblue greycorded silk limousine and a mudsplashed cheap
hooded fourseater In the back seat of this last conceive a fiery
chestnut head emerging from a long oatsack an implacable white face
with blazing eyes and jaws that worked ceaselessly at the loop of the
string that was drawn round its neck The effect under the electrics
was that of a demon caterpillar wrathfully spinning its own cocoon

Good evening I said genially Let me help you out of that The head
glared Weve got em I went on They came to quite the wrong shop
for this sort of gamequite the wrong shop

Game said the head Well see about that Let me out

It was not a promising voice for one so young and as usual I had no
knife

Youve chewed the string so I cant find the knot I said as I worked
with trembling fingers at the caterpillars throat Something untied
itself and Mr Wontner wriggled out collarless tieless his coat
split half down his back his waistcoat unbuttoned his watchchain
snapped his trousers rucked well above the knees

Where he said grimly as he pulled them down are Master Trivett and
Master Eames

Both arrested of course I replied Sir GeorgeI gave The Infants
full title as a baronetis a Justice of the Peace Hed be very
pleased if you dined with us Theres a room ready for you I picked
up the sack

Dyou know said Mr Wontner through his teethbut the cars bonnet
was between us that this looks to me likeI wont say conspiracy
yet but uncommonly like a confederacy

When injured souls begin to distinguish and qualify danger is over So
I grew bold

Sorry you take it that way I said You come here in trouble

My good fool he interrupted with a halfhysterical snort let me
assure you that the trouble will recoil on the other men

As you please I went on Anyhow the chaps who got you into trouble
are arrested and the magistrate who arrested em asks you to dinner
Shall I tell him youre walking back to Aldershot

He picked some fluff off his waistcoat

Im in no position to dictate terms yet he said That will come
later I must probe into this a little further In the meantime I
accept your invitation without prejudiceif you understand what
that means

I understood and began to be happy again Subalterns without
prejudices were quite new to me All right I replied if youll go
up to the house Ill turn out the lights

He walked off stiffly while I searched the sack and the car for the
impounded correspondence that Bobby had talked of I found nothing
except as the police reports say the trace of a struggle He had
kicked half the varnish off the back of the front seat and had bitten
the leather padding where he could reach it Evidently a purposeful and
hardmouthed young gentleman

Well done said Stalky at the door So he didnt slay you Stop
laughing Hes talking to The Infant now about depositions Look here
youre nearest his size Cut up to your rooms and give Ipps your dinner
things and a clean shirt for him

But I havent got another suit I said

You Im not thinking of you Weve got to conciliate him Hes in
filthy rags and a filthy temper and he wont feel decent till hes
dressed Youre the sacrifice Be quick And clean socks remember

Once more I trotted up to my room changed into unseasonable unbrushed
grey tweeds put studs into a clean shirt dug out fresh socks handed
the whole garniture over to Ipps and returned to the hall just in time
to hear Stalky say Im a stockbroker but I have the honour to hold
His Majestys commission in a Territorial battalion Then I felt as
though I might be beginning to be repaid

I have a very high opinion of the Territorials myself said Mr
Wontner above a glass of sherry Infant never lets us put bitters into
anything above twenty years old But if you had any experience of the
Service you would find that the Average Army Man

Here The Infant suggested changing and Ipps before whom no human
passion can assert itself led Mr Wontner away

Why the devil did you tell him I was on the Bench said Infant
wrathfully to me You know I aint now Why didnt he stay in his
fathers office Hes a raging blight

Not a bit of it said Stalky cheerfully Hes a little shaken and
excited Probably Beetle annoyed him in the garage but we must overlook
that Weve contained him so far and Im going to nibble round his
outposts at dinner All youve got to do Infant is to remember youre
a gentleman in your own house Dont hop Youll find it pretty
difficult before dinners over I dont want to hear anything at all
from you Beetle

But Im just beginning to like him I said Do let me play

Not till I ask you Youll overdo it Poor old Dhurrahbags A scandal
ud break him up

But as long as a regiment has no say as to who joins it its bound to
rag Infant began Whywhy they varnished me when I joined He
squirmed at the thought of it

Dont be owls We aint discussing principles Weve got to save the
court of inquiry if we can said Stalky

Five minutes laterat  to be precisewe four sat down to such a
dinner as I hold only The Infants cook can produce with wines worthy
of pontifical banquets A man in the extremity of rage and injured
dignity is precisely like a typhoid patient He asks no questions
accepts what is put before him and babbles in one keyvery often of
trifles But food and drink are the very best of drugs I think it was
Heidsieck Dry Monopole Stalky as usual stuck to Burgundythat
began to unlock Mr Wontners heart behind my shirtfront Me he snubbed
throughout after the Oxford manner because I had seen him in the sack
and he did not intend me to presume but to Stalky and The Infant while
I admired the set of my dinnerjacket across his shoulders he made his
plans of revenge very clear indeed He had even sketched out some of the
paragraphs that were to appear in the papers and if Stalky had allowed
me to speak I would have told him that they were rather neatly phrased

You ought to be able to get whackin damages out of em into the
bargain said Stalky after Mr Wontner had outlined his
position legally

My deah sir Mr Wontner applied himself to his glass it isnt a
matter that gentlemen usually discuss but I assure you we
Wontnershe waved a wellkept handdo not stand in any need of
filthy lucre In the next three minutes we learned exactly what his
father was worth which as he pointed out was a trifle no man of the
world dwelt on Stalky envied aloud and I delivered my first kick at
The Infants ankle Thence we drifted to education and the Average Army
Man and the desolating vacuityI remember these wordsof Army
Society notably among its womenkind It appeared there was some sort of
narrow convention in the Army against mentioning a womans name at Mess
We were much surprised at thisStalky would not let me express my
surprisebut we took it from Mr Wontner who said we might that it
was so Next he touched on Colonels of the old school and their
cognisance of tactics Not that he himself pretended to any skill in
tactics but after three years at the Varsitynone of us had had a
Varsity educationa man insensibly contracted the habit of clear
thinking At least he could automatically coordinate his ideas and
the jealousy of these muddleheaded Colonels was inconceivable We would
understand that it was his duty to force on the retirement of his
Colonel who had been in the conspiracy against him to make his
Adjutant resign or exchange and to give the halfdozen childish
subalterns who had vexed his dignity a chance to retrieve themselves in
other corpsWest African ones he hoped For himself after the case
was decided he proposed to go on living in the regiment just to
provefor he bore no malicethat times had changed nosque mutamur in
illisif we knew what that meant Infant had curled his legs out of
reach so I was quite free to return thanks yet once more to Allah for
the diversity of His creatures in His adorable world

And so by way of an eightyyearold liqueur brandy to tactics and the
great General Clausewitz unknown to the Average Army Man Here The
Infant at a whisper from Ippswhose face had darkened like a mulberry
while he waitedexcused himself and went away but Stalky Colonel of
Territorials wanted some tips on tactics He got them unbrokenly for
ten minutesWontner and Clausewitz mixed but Wontner in a film of
priceless cognac distinctly on top When The Infant came back he
renewed his clearspoken demand that Infant should take his depositions
I supposed this to be a family trait of the Wontners whom I had been
visualising for some time past even to the third generation

But hang it all theyre both asleep said Infant scowling at me
Ipps let em have the  port

Asleep said Stalky rising at once I dont see that makes any
difference As a matter of form youd better identify them Ill show
you the way

We followed up the white stone sidestaircase that leads to the
bachelors wing Mr Wontner seemed surprised that the boys were not in
the coalcellar

Oh a chaps assumed to be innocent until hes proved guilty said
Stalky mounting step by step How did they get you into the sack
Mr Wontner

Jumped on me from behindtwo to one said Mr Wontner briefly I
think I handed each of them something first but they roped my arms
and legs

And did they photograph you in the sack

Good Heavens no Mr Wontner shuddered

Thats lucky Awful thing to live downa photograph isnt it said
Stalky to me as we reached the landing Im thinking of the newspapers
of course

Oh but you can easily have sketches in the illustrated papers from
accounts supplied by eyewitnesses I said

Mr Wontner turned him round It was the first time he had honoured me
by his notice since our talk in the garage

Ah said he do you pretend to any special knowledge in these
matters

Im a journalist by profession I answered simply but nobly As soon
as youre at liberty Id like to have your account of the affair

Now I thought he would have loved me for this but he only replied in an
uncomfortable uncomingon voice Oh you would would you

Not if its any trouble of course I said I can always get their
version from the defendants Do either of em draw or sketch at all Mr
Wontner Or perhaps your father might

Then he said quite hotly I wish you to understand very clearly my
good man that a gentlemans name cant be dragged through the gutter to
bolster up the circulation of your wretched sheet whatever it may be

It is  I named a journal of enormous sales which specialises in
scholastic military and other scandals I dont know yet what it
cant do Mr Wontner

I didnt know that I was dealing with a reporter said Mr Wontner

We were all halted outside a shut door Ipps had followed us

But surely you want it in the papers dont you I urged With a
scandal like this one couldnt in justice to the democracy be
exclusive Wed syndicate it here and in the United States I helped you
out of the sack if you remember

I wish to goodness youd stop talking he snapped and sat down on a
chair Stalkys hand on my shoulder quietly signalled me out of action
but I felt that my fire had not been misdirected

Ill answer for him said Stalky to Wontner in an undertone that
dropped to a whisper I caughtNot without my leavedependent on me
for markettips and other gratifying tributes to my integrity

Still Mr Wontner sat in his chair and still we waited on him The
Infants face showed worry and heavy grief Stalkys a bright and
birdlike interest mine was hidden behind his shoulders but on the
face of Ipps were written emotions that no butler should cherish towards
any guest Contempt and wrath were the least of them And Mr Wontner
was looking full at Ipps as Ipps was looking at him Mr Wontners
father I understood kept a butler and two footmen

Dyou suppose theyre shamming in order to get off he said at last
Ipps shook his head and noiselessly threw the door open The boys had
finished their dinner and were fast asleepone on a sofa one in a long
chairtheir faces fallen back to the lines of their childhood They had
had a wildish night a hard day that ended with a tellingoff from an
artist and the assurance they had wrecked their prospects for life
What else should youth do then but eat and drink  port and
remember their sorrows no more

Mr Wontner looked at them severely Ipps within easy reach his hands
quite ready Childish said Mr Wontner at last Childish but
necessary Erhave you such a thing as a rope on the premises and a
sacktwo sacks and two ropes Im afraid I cant resist the temptation
That man understands doesnt he that this is a private matter

That man who was me was off to the basement like one of Infants own
fallowdeer The stables gave me what I wanted and coming back with it
through a dark passage I ran squarely into Ipps Go on he grunted
The minute he lays hands on Master Bobby Master Bobbys saved But
that person ought to be told how near he came to being assaulted It was
touchandgo with me all the time from the soup down I assure you

I arrived breathless with the sacks and the ropes They were two to one
with me said Mr Wontner as he took them If they wake

Well stand by Stalky replied Two to one is quite fair

But the boys hardly grunted as Mr Wontner roped first one and then the
other Even when they were slid into the sacks they only mumbled with
rolling heads through sticky lips and snored on

Port said Mr Wontner virtuously

Nervous exhaustion They arent much more than kids after all Whats
next said Stalky

I want to take em away with me please

Stalky looked at him with respect

Ill have my car round in five minutes said The Infant Ippsll help
carry em downstairs and he shook Mr Wontner by the hand

We were all perfectly serious till the two bundles were dumped on a
divan in the hall and the boys waked and began to realise what
had happened

Yah said Mr Wontner with the simplicity of twelve years old Whos
scored now And he sat upon them The tension broke in a storm of
laughter led I think by Ipps

Asinineabsolutely asinine said Mr Wontner with folded arms from
his lively chair But he drank in the flattery and the fellowship of it
all with quite a brainless grin as we rolled and stamped round him and
wiped the tears from our cheeks

Hang it said Bobby Trivett Were defeated

By tactics too said Eames I didnt think you knew em Clausewitz
Its a fair score What are you going to do with us

Take you back to Mess said Mr Wontner

Not like this

Oh no Worsemuch worse I havent begun with you yet And you
thought youd scored Yah

They had scored beyond their wildest dream The man in whose hands it
lay to shame them their Colonel their Adjutant their Regiment and
their Service had cast away all shadow of his legal rights for the sake
of a common or beargarden ragsuch a rag as if it came to the ears of
the authorities would cost him his commission They were saved and
their saviour was their equal and their brother So they chaffed and
reviled him as such till he again squashed the breath out of them and
we others laughed louder than they

Fall in said Stalky when the limousine came round This is the score
of the century I wouldnt miss it for a brigade We shant be
long Infant

I hurried into a coat

Is there any necessity for that reporterchap to come too said Mr
Wontner in an unguarded whisper He isnt dressed for one thing

Bobby and Eames wriggled round to look at the reporter began a joyous
bellow and suddenly stopped

Whats the matter said Wontner with suspicion

Nothing said Bobby I die happy Clausewitz Take me up tenderly

We packed into the car bearing our sheaves with us and for half an
hour as the cool nightair fanned his thoughtful brow Mr Wontner was
quite abreast of himself Though he said nothing unworthy he triumphed
and trumpeted a little loudly over the sacks I sat between them on the
back seat and applauded him servilely till he reminded me that what I
had seen and what he had said was not for publication I hinted while
the boys plunged with joy inside their trappings that this might be a
matter for arrangement Then a sovereign shant part us said Mr
Wontner cheerily and both boys fell into lively hysterics I dont see
where the joke comes in for you said Mr Wontner I thought it was my
little jokelet tonight

No Clausewitz gasped Bobby Some is but not all Ill be good now
Ill give you my parole till we get to Mess I wouldnt be out of this
for a fiver

Nor me said Eames and he gave his parole to attempt no escape or
evasion

Now I suppose said Mr Wontner largely to Stalky as we neared the
suburbs of Ash you have a good deal of practical joking on the Stock
Exchange havent you

And when were you on the Stock Exchange Uncle Leonard piped Bobby
while Eames laid his sobbing head on my shoulder

Im sorry said Stalky but the fact is I command a regiment myself
when Im at home Your Colonel knows me I think He gave his name Mr
Wontner seemed to have heard of it We had to pick Eames off the floor
where he had cast himself from excess of delight

Oh Heavens said Mr Wontner after a long pause What have I done
What havent I done We felt the temperature in the car rise as
he blushed

You didnt talk tactics Clausewitz said Bobby Oh say it wasnt
tactics darling

It was said Wontner

Eames was all among our feet again crying If you dont let me get my
arms up Ill be sick Lets hear what you said Tell us

But Mr Wontner turned to Stalky Its no good my begging your pardon
sir I suppose he said

Dont you notice em said Stalky It was a fair rag all round and
anyhow you two youngsters havent any right to talk tactics Youve
been rolled up horse foot and guns

Ill make a treaty If youll let us go and change presently said
Bobby Ill promise we wont tell about you Clausewitz You talked
tactics to Uncle Len Old Dhurrahbags will like that He dont love
you Claus

If Ive made one ass of myself I shall take extra care to make asses
of you said Wontner I want to stop please at the next milliners
shop on the right It ought to be close here

He evidently knew the country even in the dark for the car stopped at a
brilliantlylighted millinery establishment whereit was Saturday
eveninga young lady was clearing up the counter I followed him as a
good reporter should

Have you got he began Ah thosell do He pointed to two hairy
plush beehive bonnets one magenta the other a conscientious electric
blue How much please Ill take them both and that bunch of peacock
feathers and that red feather thing It was a brilliant crimsondyed
pigeons wing

Now I want some yards of muslin with a nice fierce pattern please
He got ityellow with black tulipsand returned heavily laden

Sorry to have kept you said he Now well go to my quarters to
change and beautify

We came to themopposite a dun waste of paradeground that might have
been Mian Mirand bugles as they blew and drums as they rolled set
heartstrings echoing

We hoisted the boys out and arranged them on chairs while Wontner
changed into uniform but stopped when he saw me taking off my jacket

What on earths that for said he

Because youve been wearing my evening things I said I want to get
into em again if you dont mind

Then you arent a reporter he said

No I said but that shant part us

Oh hurry cried Eames in desperate convulsions We cant stand this
much longer Tisnt fair on the young

Ill attend to you in good time said Wontner and when he had made
careful toilet he unwrapped the bonnets put the peacocks feather into
the magenta one pinned the crimson wing on the blue one set them
daintily on the boys heads and bade them admire the effect in his
shavingglass while he ripped the muslin into lengths bound it first
and draped it artistically afterwards a little below their knees He
finished off with a gigantic sashbow obi fashion Hobble skirts he
explained to Stalky who nodded approval

Next he split open the bottom of each sack so that they could walk but
with very short steps I ought to have got you white satin slippers
he murmured and Im sorry theres no rouge

Dont worry on our account old manyoure doing us proud said Bobby
from under his hat This beats milkpunch and mayonnaise

Oh why didnt we think of these things when we had him at our mercy
Eames wailed Never mindwell try it on the next chap Youve a
mind Claus

Now well call on em at Mess said Wontner as they minced towards
the door

I think Ill call on your Colonel said Stalky He oughtnt to miss
this Your first attempt I assure you I couldnt have done it better
myself Thank you He held out his hand

Thank you sir said Wontner shaking it Im more grateful to you
than I can say andand Id like you to believe some time that Im not
quite as big a

Not in the least Stalky interrupted If I were writing a
confidential report on you I should put you down as rather adequate
Look after your geishas or theyll fall

We watched the three cross the road and disappear into the shadow of the
Mess verandah There was a noise Then telephone bells rang a sergeant
and a Mess waiter charged out and the noise grew till at last the Mess
was a little noisy

We came back ten minutes later with Colonel Dalziell who had been
taking his sorrows to bed with him The anteroom was quite full and
visitors were still arriving but it was possible to hear oneself speak
occasionally Trivett and Eames in sack and sash sat side by side on a
table their hats at a ravishing angle coquettishly twiddling their
tied feet In the intervals of singing Put Me Among the Girls they
sipped whiskyandsoda held to their lips by I regret to say a Major
Public opinion seemed to be against allowing them to change their
costume till they should have danced in it Wontner lying more or less
gracefully at the level of the chandelier in the arms of six subalterns
was lecturing on tactics and imploring to be let down which he was with
a run when they realised that the Colonel was there Then he picked
himself up from the sofa and said I want to apologise sir to you and
the Mess for having been such an ass ever since I joined

This was when the noise began

Seeing the night promised to be wet Stalky and I went home again in The
Infants car It was some time since we had tasted the hot air that lies
between the cornice and the ceiling of crowded rooms

After half an hours silence Stalky said to me I dont know what
youve been doing but I believe Ive been weepin Would you put that
down to Burgundy or senile decay




THE CHILDREN

     These were our children who died for our lands they
         were dear in our sight
       We have only the memory left of their hometreasured
         sayings and laughter
       The price of our loss shall be paid to our hands not
         anothers hereafter
     Neither the Alien nor Priest shall decide on it That is our right
           But who shall return us the children

     At the hour the Barbarian chose to disclose his pretences
       And raged against Man they engaged on the breasts
         that they bared for us
       The first felonstroke of the sword he had longtime
         prepared for us
     Their bodies were all our defence while we wrought our defences

     They bought us anew with their blood forbearing to blame us
     Those hours which we had not made good when the Judgment
          oercame us
     They believed us and perished for it Our statecraft our learning

     Delivered them bound to the Pit and alive to the burning
     Whither they mirthfully hastened as jostling for honour
     Not since her birth has our Earth seen such worth loosed upon her

     Nor was their agony brief or once only imposed on them
       The wounded the warspent the sick received no exemption
       Being cured they returned and endured and achieved our redemption
     Hopeless themselves of relief till Death marvelling closed
          on them

     That flesh we had nursed from the first in all cleanness was given
     To corruption unveiled and assailed by the malice of Heaven
     By the heartshaking jests of Decay where it lolled on the wires
     To be blanched or gaypainted by fumesto be cindered by fires
     To be senselessly tossed and retossed in stale mutilation
     From crater to crater For this we shall take expiation
         But who shall return us our children



The Dog Hervey

April 

My friend Attley who would give away his own head if you told him you
had lost yours was giving away a sixmonthsold litter of Bettinas
pups and halfadozen women were in raptures at the show on
Mittleham lawn

We picked by lot Mrs Godfrey drew first choice her married daughter
second I was third but waived my right because I was already owned by
Malachi Bettinas full brother whom I had brought over in the car to
visit his nephews and nieces and he would have slain them all if I had
taken home one Milly Mrs Godfreys younger daughter pounced on my
rejection with squeals of delight and Attley turned to a dark
sallowskinned slackmouthed girl who had come over for tennis and
invited her to pick She put on a pincenez that made her look like a
camel knelt clumsily for she was long from the hip to the knee
breathed hard and considered the last couple

I think Id like that sandypied one she said

Oh not him Miss Sichliffe Attley cried He was overlaid or had
sunstroke or something They call him The Looney in the kennels
Besides he squints

I think thats rather fetching she answered Neither Malachi nor I
had ever seen a squinting dog before

Thats choreaSt Vituss dance Mrs Godfrey put in He ought to
have been drowned

But I like his cast of countenance the girl persisted

He doesnt look a good life I said but perhaps he can be patched
up Miss Sichliffe turned crimson I saw Mrs Godfrey exchange a glance
with her married daughter and knew I had said something which would
have to be lived down

Yes Miss Sichliffe went on her voice shaking he isnt a good life
but perhaps I canpatch him up Come here sir The misshapen beast
lurched toward her squinting down his own nose till he fell over his
own toes Then luckily Bettina ran across the lawn and reminded
Malachi of their puppyhood All that family are as queer as Dicks
hatband and fight like man and wife I had to separate them and Mrs
Godfrey helped me till they retired under the rhododendrons and had it
out in silence

Dyou know what that girls father was Mrs Godfrey asked

No I replied I loathe her for her own sake She breathes through
her mouth

He was a retired doctor she explained He used to pick up stormy
young men in the repentant stage take them home and patch them up till
they were sound enough to be insured Then he insured them heavily and
let them out into the world againwith an appetite Of course no one
knew him while he was alive but he left pots of money to his daughter

Strictly legitimatehighly respectable I said But what a life for
the daughter

Mustnt it have been Now dyou realise what you said just now

Perfectly and now youve made me quite happy shall we go back to the
house

When we reached it they were all inside sitting in committee on names

What shall you call yours I heard Milly ask Miss Sichliffe

Harvey she repliedHarveys Sauce you know Hes going to be quite
saucy when Iveshe saw Mrs Godfrey and me coming through the French
windowwhen hes stronger

Attley the wellmeaning man to make me feel at ease asked what I
thought of the name

Oh splendid I said at random H with an A A with an R R with a

But thats Little Bingo some one said and they all laughed

Miss Sichliffe her hands joined across her long knees drawled You
ought always to verify your quotations

It was not a kindly thrust but something in the word quotation set
the automatic side of my brain at work on some shadow of a word or
phrase that kept itself out of memorys reach as a cat sits just beyond
a dogs jump When I was going home Miss Sichliffe came up to me in the
twilight the pup on a leash swinging her big shoes at the end of her
tennisracket

Sorry she said in her thick schoolboylike voice Im sorry for
what I said to you about verifying quotations I didnt know you well
enough andanyhow I oughtnt to have

But you were quite right about Little Bingo I answered The spelling
ought to have reminded me

Yes of course Its the spelling she said and slouched off with the
pup sliding after her Once again my brain began to worry after
something that would have meant something if it had been properly
spelled I confided my trouble to Malachi on the way home but Bettina
had bitten him in four places and he was busy

Weeks later Attley came over to see me and before his car stopped
Malachi let me know that Bettina was sitting beside the chauffeur He
greeted her by the scruff of the neck as she hopped down and I greeted
Mrs Godfrey Attley and a big basket

Youve got to help me said Attley tiredly We took the basket into
the garden and there staggered out the angular shadow of a sandypied
brokenhaired terrier with one imbecile and one delirious ear and two
most hideous squints Bettina and Malachi already at grips on the lawn
saw him let go and fled in opposite directions

Why have you brought that fetid hound here I demanded

Harvey For you to take care of said Attley Hes had distemper but
Im going abroad

Take him with you I wont have him Hes mentally afflicted

Look here Attley almost shouted do I strike you as a fool

Always said I

Well then if you say so and Ella says so that proves I ought to go
abroad

Wills wrong quite wrong Mrs Godfrey interrupted but you must
take the pup

My dear boy my dear boy dont you ever give anything to a woman
Attley snorted

Bit by bit I got the story out of them in the quiet garden never a sign
from Bettina and Malachi while Harvey stared me out of countenance
first with one cuttlefish eye and then with the other

It appeared that a month after Miss Sichliffe took him the dog Harvey
developed distemper Miss Sichliffe had nursed him herself for some
time then she carried him in her arms the two miles to Mittleham and
weptactually weptat Attleys feet saying that Harvey was all she
had or expected to have in this world and Attley must cure him Attley
being by wealth position and temperament guardian to all lame dogs
had put everything aside for this unsavoury job and he asserted Miss
Sichliffe had virtually lived with him ever since

She went home at night of course he exploded but the rest of the
time she simply infested the premises Goodness knows Im not
particular but it was a scandal Even the servants Three and four
times a day and notes in between to know how the beast was Hang it
all dont laugh And wanting to send me flowers and goldfish Do I look
as if I wanted goldfish Cant you two stop for a minute Mrs Godfrey
and I were clinging to each other for support And it isnt as if I
waswas so alluring a personality is it

Attley commands more trust goodwill and affection than most men for
he is that rare angel an absolutely unselfish bachelor content to be
run by contending syndicates of zealous friends His situation seemed
desperate and I told him so

Instant flight is your only remedy was my verdict Ill take care of
both your cars while youre away and you can send me over all the
greenhouse fruit

But why should I be chased out of my house by a shedromedary he
wailed

Oh stop Stop Mrs Godfrey sobbed Youre both wrong I admit
youre right but I know youre wrong

Three and four times a day said Attley with an awful countenance
Im not a vain man butlook here Ella Im not sensitive I hope
but if you persist in making a joke of it

Oh be quiet she almost shrieked Dyou imagine for one instant that
your friends would ever let Mittleham pass out of their hands I quite
agree it is unseemly for a grown girl to come to Mittleham at all hours
of the day and night

I told you she went home o nights Attley growled

Specially if she goes home o nights Oh but think of the life she
must have led Will

Im not interfering with it only she must leave me alone

She may want to patch you up and insure you I suggested

Dyou know what you are Mrs Godfrey turned on me with the smile I
have feared for the last quarter of a century Youre the nice kind
wise doggy friend You dont know how wise and nice you are supposed to
be Will has sent Harvey to you to complete the poor angels
convalescence You know all about dogs or Will wouldnt have done it
Hes written her that Youre too far off for her to make daily calls on
you Praps shell drop in two or three times a week and write on
other days But it doesnt matter what she does because you dont own
Mittleham dont you see

I told her I saw most clearly

Oh youll get over that in a few days Mrs Godfrey countered
Youre the sporting responsible doggy friend who

He used to look at me like that at first said Attley with a visible
shudder but he gave it up after a bit Its only because youre new
to him

But confound you hes a ghoul I began

And when he gets quite well youll send him back to her direct with
your love and shell give you some pretty fourtailed goldfish said
Mrs Godfrey rising Thats all settled Car please Were going to
Brighton to lunch together

They ran before I could get into my stride so I told the dog Harvey
what I thought of them and his mistress He never shifted his position
but stared at me an intense lopsided stare eye after eye Malachi
came along when he had seen his sister off and from a distance
counselled me to drown the brute and consort with gentlemen again But
the dog Harvey never even cocked his cockable ear

And so it continued as long as he was with me Where I sat he sat and
stared where I walked he walked beside head stiffly slewed over one
shoulder in singlebarrelled contemplation of me He never gave tongue
never closed in for a caress seldom let me stir a step alone And to
my amazement Malachi who suffered no stranger to live within our
gates saw this gaunt growing greeneyed devil wipe him out of my
service and company without a whimper Indeed one would have said the
situation interested him for he would meet us returning from grim walks
together and look alternately at Harvey and at me with the same
quivering interest that he showed at the mouth of a rathole Outside
these inspections Malachi withdrew himself as only a dog or a
woman can

Miss Sichliffe came over after a few days luckily I was out with some
elaborate story of paying calls in the neighbourhood She sent me a note
of thanks next day I was reading it when Harvey and Malachi entered and
disposed themselves as usual Harvey close up to stare at me Malachi
half under the sofa watching us both Out of curiosity I returned
Harveys stare then pulled his lopsided head on to my knee and took
his eye for several minutes Now in Malachis eye I can see at any hour
all that there is of the normal decent dog flecked here and there with
that strained halfsoul which mans love and association have added to
his nature But with Harvey the eye was perplexed as a tortured mans
Only by looking far into its deeps could one make out the spirit of the
proper animal beclouded and cowering beneath some unfair burden

Leggatt my chauffeur came in for orders

How dyou think Harveys coming on I said as I rubbed the brutes
gulping neck The vet had warned me of the possibilities of spinal
trouble following distemper

He aint my fancy was the reply But I dont question his
comings and goings so long as I avent to sit alone in a room
with him

Why Hes as meek as Moses I said

He fair gives me the creeps Praps hell go out in fits

But Harvey as I wrote his mistress from time to time throve and when
he grew better would play by himself grisly games of spying walking
up hailing and chasing another dog From these he would break off of a
sudden and return to his normal stiff gait with the air of one who had
forgotten some matter of life and death which could be reached only by
staring at me I left him one evening posturing with the unseen on the
lawn and went inside to finish some letters for the post I must have
been at work nearly an hour for I was going to turn on the lights
when I felt there was somebody in the room whom the short hairs at the
back of my neck warned me I was not in the least anxious to face There
was a mirror on the wall As I lifted my eyes to it I saw the dog Harvey
reflected near the shadow by the closed door He had reared himself
fulllength on his hind legs his head a little one side to clear a sofa
between us and he was looking at me The face with its knitted brows
and drawn lips was the face of a dog but the look for the fraction of
time that I caught it was humanwholly and horribly human When the
blood in my body went forward again he had dropped to the floor and was
merely studying me in his usual oneeyed fashion Next day I returned
him to Miss Sichliffe I would not have kept him another day for the
wealth of Asia or even Ella Godfreys approval

Miss Sichliffes house I discovered to be a midVictorian mansion of
peculiar villainy even for its period surrounded by gardens of
conflicting colours all dazzling with glass and fresh paint on
ironwork Striped blinds for it was a blazing autumn morning covered
most of the windows and a voice sang to the piano an almost forgotten
song of Jean Ingelows

     Methought that the stars were blinking bright
       And the old brigs sails unfurled

Down came the loud pedal and the unrestrained cry swelled out across a
bed of tritomas consuming in their own fires

     When I said I will sail to my love this night
       On the other side of the world

I have no music but the voice drew I waited till the end

     Oh maid most dear I am not here
       I have no place apart
     No dwelling more on sea or shore
       But only in thy heart

It seemed to me a poor life that had no more than that to do at eleven
oclock of a Tuesday forenoon Then Miss Sichliffe suddenly lumbered
through a French window in clumsy haste her brows contracted against
the light

Well she said delivering the word like a spearthrust with the full
weight of a body behind it

Ive brought Harvey back at last I replied Here he is

But it was at me she looked not at the dog who had cast himself at her
feetlooked as though she would have fished my soul out of my breast on
the instant

Whawhat did you think of him What did you make of him she
panted I was too taken aback for the moment to reply Her voice broke
as she stooped to the dog at her knees O Harvey Harvey You utterly
worthless old devil she cried and the dog cringed and abased himself
in servility that one could scarcely bear to look upon I made to go

Oh but please you mustnt She tugged at the cars side Wouldnt
you like some flowers or some orchids Weve really splendid orchids
andshe clasped her handsthere are Japanese goldfishreal
Japanese goldfish with four tails If you dont care for em perhaps
your friends or somebodyoh please

Harvey had recovered himself and I realised that this woman beyond the
decencies was fawning on me as the dog had fawned on her

Certainly I said ashamed to meet her eye Im lunching at
Mittleham but

Theres plenty of time she entreated What do you think of
Harvey

Hes a queer beast I said getting out He does nothing but stare at
me

Does he stare at you all the time hes with you

Always Hes doing it now Look

We had halted Harvey had sat down and was staring from one to the
other with a weaving motion of the head

Hell do that all day I said What is it Harvey

Yes what is it Harvey she echoed The dogs throat twitched his
body stiffened and shook as though he were going to have a fit Then he
came back with a visible wrench to his unwinking watch

Always so she whispered

Always I replied and told her something of his life with me She
nodded once or twice and in the end led me into the house

There were unaging pitchpine doors of Gothic design in it there were
inlaid marble mantelpieces and cutsteel fenders there were stupendous
wallpapers and octagonal medallioned Wedgwood whatnots and
blackandgilt Austrian images holding candelabra with every other
refinement that Art had achieved or wealth had bought between  and
 And everything reeked of varnish

Now she opened a baize door and pointed down a long corridor flanked
with more Gothic doors This was where we used toto patch em up
Youve heard of us Mrs Godfrey told you in the garden the day I got
Harvey given me Ishe drew in her breathI live here by myself and
I have a very large income Come back Harvey

He had tiptoed down the corridor as rigid as ever and was sitting
outside one of the shut doors Look here she said and planted
herself squarely in front of me I tell you this because youyouve
patched up Harvey too Now I want you to remember that my name is
Moira Mother calls me Marjorie because its more refined but my real
name is Moira and I am in my thirtyfourth year

Very good I said Ill remember all that

Thank you Then with a sudden swoop into the humility of an abashed
boySorry if I havent said the proper things You seetheres
Harvey looking at us again Oh I want to sayif ever you want anything
in the way of orchids or goldfish oror anything else that would be
useful to you youve only to come to me for it Under the will Im
perfectly independent and were a longlived family worse luck She
looked at me and her face worked like glass behind driven flame I may
reasonably expect to live another fifty years she said

Thank you Miss Sichliffe I replied If I want anything you may be
sure Ill come to you for it She nodded Now I must get over to
Mittleham I said

Mr Attley will ask you all about this For the first time she laughed
aloud Im afraid I frightened him nearly out of the county I didnt
think of course But I dare say he knows by this time he was wrong Say
goodbye to Harvey

Goodbye old man I said Give me a farewell stare so we shall know
each other when we meet again

The dog looked up then moved slowly toward me and stood head bowed to
the floor shaking in every muscle as I patted him and when I turned I
saw him crawl back to her feet

That was not a good preparation for the rampant boyandgirldominated
lunch at Mittleham which as usual I found in possession of everybody
except the owner

But what did the dromedary say when you brought her beast back Attley
demanded

The usual polite things I replied Im posing as the nice doggy
friend nowadays

I dont envy you Shes never darkened my doors thank goodness since
I left Harvey at your place I suppose shell run about the county now
swearing you cured him Thats a womans idea of gratitude Attley
seemed rather hurt and Mrs Godfrey laughed

That proves you were right about Miss Sichliffe Ella I said She
had no designs on anybody

Im always right in these matters But didnt she even offer you a
goldfish

Not a thing said I You know what an old maids like where her
precious dogs concerned And though I have tried vainly to lie to Ella
Godfrey for many years I believe that in this case I succeeded

When I turned into our drive that evening Leggatt observed half aloud

Im glad Zvengalis back where he belongs Its time our Mike had a
look in

Sure enough there was Malachi back again in spirit as well as flesh
but still with that odd air of expectation he had picked up from Harvey

                                   

It was in January that Attley wrote me that Mrs Godfrey wintering in
Madeira with Milly her unmarried daughter had been attacked with
something like enteric that the hotel anxious for its good name had
thrust them both out into a cottage annexe that he was off with a
nurse and that I was not to leave England till I heard from him again
In a week he wired that Milly was down as well and that I must bring
out two more nurses with suitable delicacies

Within seventeen hours I had got them all aboard the Cape boat and had
seen the women safely collapsed into seasickness The next few weeks
were for me as for the invalids a low delirium clouded with fantastic
memories of Portuguese officials trying to tax calvesfoot jelly
voluble doctors insisting that true typhoid was unknown in the island
nurses who had to be exercised taken out of themselves and returned on
the tick of change of guard night slides down glassy cobbled streets
smelling of sewage and flowers between walls whose every stone and
patch Attley and I knew vigils in stucco verandahs watching the curve
and descent of great stars or drawing auguries from the break of dawn
insane interludes of gambling at the local Casino where we won heaps of
unconsoling silver blasts of steamers arriving and departing in the
roads help offered by total strangers grabbed at or thrust aside the
long nightmare crumbling back into sanity one forenoon under a
vinecovered trellis where Attley sat hugging a nurse while the others
danced a noiseless neatfooted breakdown never learned at the Middlesex
Hospital At last as the tension came out all over us in aches and
tingles that we put down to the country wine a vision of Mrs Godfrey
her grey hair turned to spunglass but her eyes triumphant over the
shadow of retreating death beneath them with Milly enormously grown
and clutching life back to her young breast both stretched out on cane
chairs clamouring for food

In this ungirt hour there imported himself into our life a
youngishlooking middleaged man of the name of Shend with a blurred
face and deprecating eyes He said he had gambled with me at the Casino
which was no recommendation and I remember that he twice gave me a
basket of champagne and liqueur brandy for the invalids which a sailor
in a redtasselled cap carried up to the cottage for me at  AM He
turned out to be the son of some merchant prince in the oil and colour
line and the owner of a fourhundredton steam yacht into which at
his gentle insistence we later shifted our camp staff and equipage
Milly weeping with delight to escape from the horrible cottage There we
lay off Funchal for weeks while Shend did miracles of luxury and
attendance through deputies and never once asked how his guests were
enjoying themselves Indeed for several days at a time we would see
nothing of him He was he said subject to malaria Giving as they do
with both hands I knew that Attley and Mrs Godfrey could take nobly
but I never met a man who so nobly gave and so nobly received thanks as
Shend did

Tell us why you have been so unbelievably kind to us gipsies Mrs
Godfrey said to him one day on deck

He looked up from a diagram of some Thamesmouth shoals which he was
explaining to me and answered with his gentle smile

I will Its because it makes me happyit makes me more than happyto
be with you It makes me comfortable You know how selfish men are If a
man feels comfortable all over with certain people hell bore them to
death just like a dog You always make me feel as if pleasant things
were going to happen to me

Havent any ever happened before Milly asked

This is the most pleasant thing that has happened to me in ever so many
years he replied I feel like the man in the Bible Its good for me
to be here Generally I dont feel that its good for me to be
anywhere in particular Then as one begging a favour Youll let me
come home with youin the same boat I mean Id take you back in this
thing of mine and that would save you packing your trunks but shes
too lively for spring work across the Bay

We booked our berths and when the time came he wafted us and ours
aboard the Southampton mailboat with the pomp of plenipotentiaries and
the precision of the Navy Then he dismissed his yacht and became an
inconspicuous passenger in a cabin opposite to mine on the port side

We ran at once into early British spring weather followed by souwest
gales Mrs Godfrey Milly and the nurses disappeared Attley stood it
out visibly yellowing till the next meal and followed suit and Shend
and I had the little table all to ourselves I found him even more
attractive when the women were away The natural sweetness of the man
his voice and bearing all fascinated me and his knowledge of practical
seamanship he held an extra masters certificate was a real joy We
sat long in the empty saloon and longer in the smokingroom making
dashes downstairs over slippery decks at the eleventh hour

It was on Friday night just as I was going to bed that he came into my
cabin after cleaning his teeth which he did half a dozen times a day

I say he began hurriedly do you mind if I come in here for a
little Im a bit edgy I must have shown surprise Im ever so much
better about liquor than I used to be butits the whisky in the
suitcase that throws me For Gods sake old man dont go back on me
tonight Look at my hands

They were fairly jumping at the wrists He sat down on a trunk that had
slid out with the roll We had reduced speed and were surging in
confused seas that pounded on the black portglasses The night promised
to be a pleasant one

You understand of course dont you he chattered

Oh yes I said cheerily but how about

No no on no account the doctor Tell a doctor tell the whole ship
Besides Ive only got a touch of em Youd never have guessed it
would you The toothwash does the trick Ill give you the
prescription

Ill send a note to the doctor for a prescription shall I I
suggested

Right I put myself unreservedly in your hands Fact is I always did
I said to myselfsure I dont bore youthe minute I saw you I said
Thou art the man He repeated the phrase as he picked at his knees
All the same you can take it from me that the ewelamb business is a
rotten bad one I dont care how unfaithful the shepherd may be Drunk
or sober tisnt cricket

A surge of the trunk threw him across the cabin as the steward answered
my bell I wrote my requisition to the doctor while Shend was struggling
to his feet

Whats wrong he began Oh I know Were slowing for soundings off
Ushant Its about time too Youd better ship the deadlights when you
come back Matchem Itll save you waking us later This seas going to
get up when the tide turns Thatll show you he said as the man left
that I am to be trusted Youyoull stop me if I say anything I
shouldnt wont you

Talk away I replied if it makes you feel better

Thats it youve hit it exactly You always make me feel better I can
rely on you Its awkward soundings but youll see me through it Well
defeat him yet I may be an utterly worthless devil but Im not a
brawler I told him so at breakfast I said Doctor I detest
brawling but if ever you allow that girl to be insulted again as
Clements insulted her I will break your neck with my own hands You
think I was right

Absolutely I agreed

Then we neednt discuss the matter any further That man was a murderer
in intentionoutside the law you understand as it was then Theyve
changed it sincebut he never deceived me I told him so I said to
him at the time I dont know what price youre going to put on my
head but if ever you allow Clements to insult her again youll never
live to claim it

And what did he do I asked to carry on the conversation for Matchem
entered with the bromide

Oh crumpled up at once Lead still going Matchem

I avent eard said that faithful servant of the UnionCastle
Company

Quite right Never alarm the passengers Ship the deadlight will
you Matchem shipped it for we were rolling very heavily There were
tramplings and gulllike cries from on deck Shend looked at me with a
mariners eye

Thats nothing he said protectingly

Oh its all right for you I said jumping at the idea I havent
an extra masters certificate Im only a passenger I confess it
funks me

Instantly his whole bearing changed to answer the appeal

My dear fellow its as simple as houses Were hunting for sixtyfive
fathom water Anything short of sixty with a souwest wind meansbut
Ill get my Channel Pilot out of my cabin and give you the general idea
Im only too grateful to do anything to put your mind at ease

And so perhaps for another hourhe declined the drinkChannel Pilot
in hand he navigated us round Ushant and at my request upchannel to
Southampton light by light with explanations and reminiscences I
professed myself soothed at last and suggested bed

In a second said he Now you wouldnt think would youhe glanced
off the book toward my wildly swaying dressinggown on the doorthat
Ive been seeing things for the last halfhour Fact is Im just on
the edge of em skating on thin ice round the cornernoreast as near
as nothingwhere that dogs looking at me

Whats the dog like I asked

Ah that is comforting of you Most men walk through em to show me
they arent real As if I didnt know But youre different Anybody
could see that with half an eye He stiffened and pointed Damn it
all The dog sees it too with half anWhy he knows you Knows you
perfectly Dyou know him

How can I tell if he isnt real I insisted

But you can Youre all right I saw that from the first Dont go
back on me now or I shall go to pieces like the Drummond Castle I beg
your pardon old man but you see you do know the dog Ill prove
it Whats that dog doing Come on You know A tremor shook him and
he put his hand on my knee and whispered with great meaning Ill
letter or halve it with you There You begin

S said I to humour him for a dog would most likely be standing or
sitting or may be scratching or sniffling or staring

Q he went on and I could feel the heat of his shaking hand

U said I There was no other letter possible but I was shaking too

I

N

Ting he ran out There That proves it I knew you knew him You
dont know what a relief that is Between ourselves old man hehes
been turning up lately aa damn sight more often than I cared for And
a squinting doga dog that squints I mean thats a bit too much
Eh What He gulped and half rose and I thought that the full tide of
delirium would be on him in another sentence

Not a bit of it I said as a last chance with my hand over the
bellpush Why youve just proved that I know him so there are two of
us in the game anyhow

By Jove that is an idea Of course there are I knew youd see me
through Well defeat them yet Hi pup Hes gone Absolutely
disappeared He sighed with relief and I caught the lucky moment

Good business I expect he only came to have a look at me I said
Now get this drink down and turn in to the lower bunk

He obeyed protesting that he could not inconvenience me and in the
midst of apologies sank into a dead sleep I expected a wakeful night
having a certain amount to think over but no sooner had I scrambled
into the top bunk than sleep came on me like a wave from the other side
of the world

In the morning there were apologies which we got over at breakfast
before our party were about

I supposeafter thiswell I dont blame you Im rather a lonely
chap though His eyes lifted doglike across the table

Shend I replied Im not running a Sunday school Youre coming home
with me in my car as soon as we land

That is kind of youkinder than you think

Thats because youre a little jumpy still Now I dont want to mix
up in your private affairs

But Id like you to he interrupted

Then would you mind telling me the Christian name of a girl who was
insulted by a man called Clements

Moira he whispered and just then Mrs Godfrey and Milly came to
table with their shoregoing hats on

We did not tie up till noon but the faithful Leggatt had intrigued his
way down to the dockedge and beside him sat Malachi wearing his
collar of gold or Leggatt makes it look so as eloquent as Demosthenes
Shend flinched a little when he saw him We packed Mrs Godfrey and
Milly into Attleys carthey were going with him to Mittleham of
courseand drew clear across the railway lines to find England all lit
and perfumed for spring Shend sighed with happiness

Dyou know he said ifif youd chucked meI should have gone down
to my cabin after breakfast and cut my throat And nowits like a
dreama good dream you know

We lunched with the other three at Romsey Then I sat in front for a
little while to talk to my Malachi When I looked back Shend was
solidly asleep and stayed so for the next two hours while Leggatt
chased Attleys fat Daimler along the greenspeckled hedges He woke up
when we said goodbye at Mittleham with promises to meet again
very soon

And I hope said Mrs Godfrey that everything pleasant will happen
to you

Heaps and heapsall at once cried long weak Milly waving her wet
handkerchief

Ive just got to look in at a house near here for a minute to inquire
about a dog I said and then we will go home

I used to know this part of the world he replied and said no more
till Leggatt shot past the lodge at the Sichliffess gate Then I
heard him gasp

Miss Sichliffe in a green waterproof an orange jersey and a pinkish
leather hat was working on a bulbborder She straightened herself as
the car stopped and breathed hard Shend got out and walked towards
her They shook hands turned round together and went into the house
Then the dog Harvey pranced out corkily from under the lee of a bench
Malachi with one joyous swoop fell on him as an enemy and an equal
Harvey for his part freed from all burden whatsoever except the
obvious duty of a mandog on his own ground met Malachi without reserve
or remorse and with six months additional growth to come and go on

Dont check em cried Leggatt dancing round the flurry Theyve
both been saving up for each other all this time Itll do em worlds
of good

Leggatt I said will you take Mr Shends bag and suitcase up to the
house and put them down just inside the door Then we will go on

So I enjoyed the finish alone It was a dead heat and they licked each
others jaws in amity till Harvey one imploring eye on me leaped into
the front seat and Malachi backed his appeal It was theft but I took
him and we talked all the way home of rrats and rrabbits and bones
and baths and the other basic facts of life That evening after dinner
they slept before the fire with their warm chins across the hollows of
my anklesto each chin an ankletill I kicked them upstairs to bed

                                   

I was not at Mittleham when she came over to announce her engagement
but I heard of it when Mrs Godfrey and Attley came forty miles an
hour over to me and Mrs Godfrey called me names of the worst for
suppression of information

As long as it wasnt me I dont care said Attley

I believe you knew it all along Mrs Godfrey repeated Else what
made you drive that man literally into her arms

To ask after the dog Harvey I replied

Then whats the beast doing here Attley demanded for Malachi and
the dog Harvey were deep in a council of the family with Bettina who
was being outargued

Oh Harvey seemed to think himself de trop where he was I said
And she hasnt sent after him Youd better save Bettina before they
kill her

Theres been enough lying about that dog said Mrs Godfrey to me If
he wasnt born in lies he was baptized in em Dyou know why she
called him Harvey It only occurred to me in those dreadful days when I
was ill and one cant keep from thinking and thinks everything Dyou
know your Boswell What did Johnson say about Herveywith an e

Oh thats it is it I cried incautiously That was why I ought to
have verified my quotations The spelling defeated me Wait a moment
and it will come back Johnson said He was a vicious man I began

But very kind to me Mrs Godfrey prompted Then both together
If you call a dog Hervey I shall love him

So you were mixed up in it At any rate you had your suspicions from
the first Tell me she said

Ella I said I dont know anything rational or reasonable about any
of it It was allall womanwork and it scared me horribly

Why she asked

That was six years ago I have written this tale to let her
knowwherever she may be



THE COMFORTERS


     Until thy feet have trod the Road
       Advise not wayside folk
     Nor till thy back has borne the Load
       Break in upon the Broke

     Chase not with undesired largesse
       Of sympathy the heart
     Which knowing her own bitterness
       Presumes to dwell apart

     Employ not that glad hand to raise
       The Godforgotten head
     To Heaven and all the neighbours gaze
       Cover thy mouth instead

     The quivering chin the bitten lip
       The cold and sweating brow
     Later may yearn for fellowship
       Not now you ass not now

     Time not thy neer so timely speech
       Life not thy views thereon
     Shall furnish or deny to each
       His consolation

     Or if impelled to interfere
       Exhort uplift advise
     Lend not a base betraying ear
       To all the victims cries

     Only the Lord can understand
       When those first pangs begin
     How much is reflex action and
       How much is really sin

     Een from good words thyself refrain
       And tremblingly admit
     There is no anodyne for pain
       Except the shock of it

     So when thine own dark hour shall fall
       Unchallenged canst thou say
     I never worried you at all
       For Gods sake go away




The Village that Voted the Earth was Flat




Our drive till then had been quite a success The other men in the car
were my friend Woodhouse young Ollyett a distant connection of his
and Pallant the MP Woodhouses business was the treatment and cure of
sick journals He knew by instinct the precise moment in a newspapers
life when the impetus of past good management is exhausted and it
fetches up on the deadcentre between slow and expensive collapse and
the new start which can be given by gold injectionsand genius He was
wisely ignorant of journalism but when he stooped on a carcase there
was sure to be meat He had that week added a halfdead halfpenny
evening paper to his collection which consisted of a prosperous London
daily one provincial ditto and a limpbodied weekly of commercial
leanings He had also that very hour planted me with a large block of
the evening papers common shares and was explaining the whole art of
editorship to Ollyett a young man three years from Oxford with
coirmattingcoloured hair and a face harshly modelled by harsh
experiences who I understood was assisting in the new venture
Pallant the long wrinkled MP whose voice is more like a cranes
than a peacocks took no shares but gave us all advice

Youll find it rather a knackers yard Woodhouse was saying Yes I
know they call me The Knacker but it will pay inside a year All my
papers do Ive only one motto Back your luck and back your staff
Itll come out all right

Then the car stopped and a policeman asked our names and addresses for
exceeding the speedlimit We pointed out that the road ran absolutely
straight for half a mile ahead without even a sidelane Thats just
what we depend on said the policeman unpleasantly

The usual swindle said Woodhouse under his breath Whats the name
of this place

Huckley said the policeman Huckley and wrote something in
his notebook at which young Ollyett protested A large red man on a
grey horse who had been watching us from the other side of the hedge
shouted an order we could not catch The policeman laid his hand on the
rim of the right drivingdoor Woodhouse carries his spare tyres aft
and it closed on the button of the electric horn The grey horse at once
bolted and we could hear the rider swearing all across the landscape

Damn it man youve got your silly fist on it Take it off Woodhouse
shouted

Ho said the constable looking carefully at his fingers as though we
had trapped them That wont do you any good either and he wrote once
more in his notebook before he allowed us to go

This was Woodhouses first brush with motor law and since I expected
no ill consequences to myself I pointed out that it was very serious I
took the same view myself when in due time I found that I too was
summonsed on charges ranging from the use of obscene language to
endangering traffic

Judgment was done in a little paleyellow markettown with a small
Jubilee clocktower and a large cornexchange Woodhouse drove us there
in his car Pallant who had not been included in the summons came with
us as moral support While we waited outside the fat man on the grey
horse rode up and entered into loud talk with his brother magistrates
He said to one of themfor I took the trouble to note it downIt
falls away from my lodgegates dead straight threequarters of a mile
Id defy any one to resist it We rooked seventy pounds out of em last
month No car can resist the temptation You ought to have one your side
the county Mike They simply cant resist it

Whew said Woodhouse Were in for trouble Dont you say a wordor
Ollyett either Ill pay the fines and well get it over as soon as
possible Wheres Pallant

At the back of the court somewhere said Ollyett I saw him slip in
just now

The fat man then took his seat on the Bench of which he was chairman
and I gathered from a bystander that his name was Sir Thomas Ingell
Bart MP of Ingell Park Huckley He began with an allocution
pitched in a tone that would have justified revolt throughout empires
Evidence when the crowded little court did not drown it with applause
was given in the pauses of the address They were all very proud of
their Sir Thomas and looked from him to us wondering why we did not
applaud too

Taking its time from the chairman the Bench rollicked with us for
seventeen minutes Sir Thomas explained that he was sick and tired of
processions of cads of our type who would be better employed breaking
stones on the road than in frightening horses worth more than themselves
or their ancestors This was after it had been proved that Woodhouses
man had turned on the horn purposely to annoy Sir Thomas who happened
to be riding by There were other remarks tooprimitive enoughbut
it was the unspeakable brutality of the tone even more than the quality
of the justice or the laughter of the audience that stung our souls out
of all reason When we were dismissedto the tune of twentythree
pounds twelve shillings and sixpencewe waited for Pallant to join us
while we listened to the next caseone of driving without a licence
Ollyett with an eye to his evening paper had already taken very full
notes of our own but we did not wish to seem prejudiced

Its all right said the reporter of the local paper soothingly We
never report Sir Thomas in extenso Only the fines and charges

Oh thank you Ollyett replied and I heard him ask who every one in
court might be The local reporter was very communicative

The new victim a large flaxenhaired man in somewhat striking
clothes to which Sir Thomas now thoroughly warmed drew public
attention said that he had left his licence at home Sir Thomas asked
him if he expected the police to go to his home address at Jerusalem to
find it for him and the court roared Nor did Sir Thomas approve of the
mans name but insisted on calling him Mr Masquerader and every
time he did so all his people shouted Evidently this was their
established autodaf

He didnt summons mebecause Im in the House I suppose I think I
shall have to ask a Question said Pallant reappearing at the close
of the case

I think I shall have to give it a little publicity too said
Woodhouse We cant have this kind of thing going on you know His
face was set and quite white Pallants on the other hand was black
and I know that my very stomach had turned with rage Ollyett was dum

Well lets have lunch Woodhouse said at last Then we can get away
before the show breaks up

We drew Ollyett from the arms of the local reporter crossed the Market
Square to the Red Lion and found Sir Thomass Mr Masquerader just
sitting down to beer beef and pickles

Ah said he in a large voice Companions in misfortune Wont you
gentlemen join me

Delighted said Woodhouse What did you get

I havent decided It might make a good turn butthe public arent
educated up to it yet Its beyond em If it wasnt that red dub on
the Bench would be worth fifty a week

Where said Woodhouse The man looked at him with unaffected surprise

At any one of My places he replied But perhaps you live here

Good heavens cried young Ollyett suddenly You are Masquerier
then I thought you were

Bat Masquerier He let the words fall with the weight of an
international ultimatum Yes thats all I am But you have the
advantage of me gentlemen

For the moment while we were introducing ourselves I was puzzled Then
I recalled prismatic musichall postersof enormous acreagethat had
been the unnoticed background of my visits to London for years past
Posters of men and women singers jongleurs impersonators and
audacities of every draped and undraped brand all moved on and off in
London and the Provinces by Bat Masquerierwith the long wedgetailed
flourish following the final r

I knew you at once said Pallant the trained MP and I promptly
backed the lie Woodhouse mumbled excuses Bat Masquerier was not moved
for or against us any more than the frontage of one of his own palaces

I always tell My people theres a limit to the size of the lettering
he said Overdo that and the retna doesnt take it in Advertisin is
the most delicate of all the sciences

Theres one man in the world who is going to get a little of it if I
live for the next twentyfour hours said Woodhouse and explained how
this would come about

Masquerier stared at him lengthily with gunmetalblue eyes

You mean it he drawled the voice was as magnetic as the look

I do said Ollyett That business of the horn alone ought to have
him off the Bench in three months Masquerier looked at him even longer
than he had looked at Woodhouse

He told me he said suddenly that my homeaddress was Jerusalem
You heard that

But it was the tonethe tone Ollyett cried

You noticed that too did you said Masquerier Thats the artistic
temperament You can do a lot with it And Im Bat Masquerier he went
on He dropped his chin in his fists and scowled straight in front of
him I made the SilhouettesI made the Trefoil and the Jocunda I
made Dal Benzaguen Here Ollyett sat straight up for in common with
the youth of that year he worshipped Miss Vidal Benzaguen of the Trefoil
immensely and unreservedly Is that a dressinggown or an ulster
youre supposed to be wearing You heard that And I suppose you
hadnt time to brush your hair either You heard that Now you
hear me His voice filled the coffeeroom then dropped to a whisper
as dreadful as a surgeons before an operation He spoke for several
minutes Pallant muttered Hear hear I saw Ollyetts eye flashit
was to Ollyett that Masquerier addressed himself chieflyand
Woodhouse leaned forward with joined hands

Are you with me he went on gathering us all up in one sweep of the
arm When I begin a thing I see it through gentlemen What Bat cant
break breaks him But I havent struck that thing yet This is no
oneturn turnitdown show This is business to the dead finish Are you
with me gentlemen Good Now well pool our assets One London
morning and one provincial daily didnt you say One weekly commercial
ditto and one MP

Not much use Im afraid Pallant smirked

But privileged But privileged he returned And we have also my
little teamLondon Blackburn Liverpool LeedsIll tell you about
Manchester laterand Me Bat Masquerier He breathed the name
reverently into his tankard Gentlemen when our combination has
finished with Sir Thomas Ingell Bart MP and everything else that
is his Sodom and Gomorrah will be a winsome bit of Merrie England
beside em I must go back to town now but I trust you gentlemen will
give me the pleasure of your company at dinner tonight at the Chop
Sueythe Red Amber Roomand well block out the scenario He laid his
hand on young Ollyetts shoulder and added Its your brains I want
Then he left in a good deal of astrachan collar and nickelplated
limousine and the place felt less crowded

We ordered our car a few minutes later As Woodhouse Ollyett and I were
getting in Sir Thomas Ingell Bart MP came out of the Hall of
Justice across the square and mounted his horse I have sometimes
thought that if he had gone in silence he might even then have been
saved but as he settled himself in the saddle he caught sight of us and
must needs shout Not off yet Youd better get away and youd better
be careful At that moment Pallant who had been buying
picturepostcards came out of the inn took Sir Thomass eye and very
leisurely entered the car It seemed to me that for one instant there
was a shade of uneasiness on the baronets greywhiskered face

I hope said Woodhouse after several miles I hope hes a widower

Yes said Pallant For his poor dear wifes sake I hope that very
much indeed I suppose he didnt see me in Court Oh heres the parish
history of Huckley written by the Rector and heres your share of the
picturepostcards Are we all dining with this Mr Masquerier tonight

Yes said we all

                                   

If Woodhouse knew nothing of journalism young Ollyett who had
graduated in a hard school knew a good deal Our halfpenny evening
paper which we will call The Bun to distinguish her from her
prosperous morning sister The Cake was not only diseased but
corrupt We found this out when a man brought us the prospectus of a new
oilfield and demanded subleaders on its prosperity Ollyett talked
pure Brasenose to him for three minutes Otherwise he spoke and wrote
tradeEnglisha toothsome amalgam of Americanisms and epigrams But
though the slang changes the game never alters and Ollyett and I and
in the end some others enjoyed it immensely It was weeks ere we could
see the wood for the trees but so soon as the staff realised that they
had proprietors who backed them right or wrong and specially when they
were wrong which is the sole secret of journalism and that their fate
did not hang on any passing owners passing mood they did miracles

But we did not neglect Huckley As Ollyett said our first care was to
create an arresting atmosphere round it He used to visit the village
of weekends on a motorbicycle with a sidecar for which reason I
left the actual place alone and dealt with it in the abstract Yet it
was I who drew first blood Two inhabitants of Huckley wrote to
contradict a small quite solid paragraph in The Bun that a hoopoe had
been seen at Huckley and had of course been shot by the local
sportsmen There was some heat in their letters both of which we
published Our version of how the hoopoe got his crest from King Solomon
was I grieve to say so inaccurate that the Rector himselfno
sportsman as he pointed out but a lover of accuracywrote to us to
correct it We gave his letter good space and thanked him

This priest is going to be useful said Ollyett He has the impartial
mind I shall vitalise him

Forthwith he created ML Sigden a recluse of refined tastes who in
The Bun demanded to know whether this HuckleyoftheHoopoe was the
Hugly of his boyhood and whether by any chance the fell change of name
had been wrought by collusion between a local magnate and the railway
in the mistaken interests of spurious refinement For I knew it and
loved it with the maidens of my dayeheu ab anguloas Hugly wrote
ML Sigden from Oxf

Though other papers scoffed The Bun was gravely sympathetic Several
people wrote to deny that Huckley had been changed at birth Only the
Rectorno philosopher as he pointed out but a lover of accuracyhad
his doubts which he laid publicly before Mr ML Sigden who suggested
through The Bun that the little place might have begun life in
AngloSaxon days as Hogslea or among the Normans as Argil on
account of its much clay The Rector had his own ideas too he said it
was mostly gravel and ML Sigden had a fund of reminiscences Oddly
enoughwhich is seldom the case with free readingmatterour
subscribers rather relished the correspondence and contemporaries
quoted freely

The secret of power said Ollyett is not the big stick Its the
liftable stick This means the arresting quotation of six or seven
lines Did you see the Spec had a middle on Rural Tenacities last
week That was all Huckley Im doing a Mobiquity on Huckley
next week

Our Mobiquities were Friday evening accounts of easy
motorbikecumsidecar trips round London illustrated we could
never get that machine to work properly by smudgy maps Ollyett wrote
the stuff with a fervour and a delicacy which I always ascribed to the
sidecar His account of Epping Forest for instance was simply young
love with its soul at its lips But his Huckley Mobiquity would have
sickened a soapboiler It chemically combined loathsome familiarity
leering suggestion slimy piety and rancid social service in one
fuming compost that fairly lifted me off my feet

Yes said he after compliments Its the most vital arresting and
dynamic bit of tump Ive done up to date Non nobis gloria I met Sir
Thomas Ingell in his own park He talked to me again He inspired
most of it

Which The glutinous native drawl or the neglected adenoids of the
village children I demanded

Oh no Thats only to bring in the panel doctor Its the last flight
weIm proudest of

This dealt with the crepuscular penumbra spreading her dim limbs over
the boskage with jolly rabbits with a herd of gravid polled
Angus and with the arresting gipsylike face of their swart
scholarly owneras well known at the Royal Agricultural Shows as that
of our late KingEmperor

Swart is good and sos gravid said I but the panel doctor will
be annoyed about the adenoids

Not half as much as Sir Thomas will about his face said Ollyett And
if you only knew what Ive left out

He was right The panel doctor spent his weekend this is the
advantage of Friday articles in overwhelming us with a professional
counterblast of no interest whatever to our subscribers We told him so
and he then and there battered his way with it into the Lancet where
they are keen on glands and forgot us altogether But Sir Thomas Ingell
was of sterner stuff He must have spent a happy weekend too The
letter which we received from him on Monday proved him to be a kinless
loon of upright life for no woman however remotely interested in a man
would have let it pass the home wastepaperbasket He objected to our
references to his own herd to his own labours in his own village which
he said was a Model Village and to our infernal insolence but he
objected most to our invoice of his features We wrote him courtously to
ask whether the letter was meant for publication He remembering I
presume the Duke of Wellington wrote back publish and be damned

Oh This is too easy Ollyett said as he began heading the letter

Stop a minute I said The game is getting a little beyond us
Tonights the Bat dinner I may have forgotten to tell you that our
dinner with Bat Masquerier in the Red Amber Room of the Chop Suey had
come to be a weekly affair Hold it over till theyve all seen it

Perhaps youre right he said You might waste it

At dinner then Sir Thomass letter was handed round Bat seemed to be
thinking of other matters but Pallant was very interested

Ive got an idea he said presently Could you put something into
The Bun tomorrow about footandmouth disease in that fellows herd

Oh plague if you like Ollyett replied Theyre only five measly
Shorthorns I saw one lying down in the park Shell serve as a
substratum of fact

Then do that and hold the letter over meanwhile I think I come in
here said Pallant

Why said I

Because theres something coming up in the House about footandmouth
and because he wrote me a letter after that little affair when he fined
you Took ten days to think it over Here you are said Pallant
House of Commons paper you see

We read

     DEAR PALLANTAlthough in the past our paths have not lain
     much together I am sure you will agree with me that on the
     floor of the House all members are on a footing of equality
     I make bold therefore to approach you in a matter which I
     think capable of a very different interpretation from that
     which perhaps was put upon it by your friends Will you let
     them know that that was the case and that I was in no way
     swayed by animus in the exercise of my magisterial duties
     which as you as a brother magistrate can imagine are
     frequently very distasteful toYours very sincerely

     T INGELL

     PSI have seen to it that the motor vigilance to which
     your friends took exception has been considerably relaxed in
     my district

What did you answer said Ollyett when all our opinions had been
expressed

I told him I couldnt do anything in the matter And I couldntthen
But youll remember to put in that footandmouth paragraph I want
something to work upon

It seems to me The Bun has done all the work up to date I
suggested When does The Cake come in

The Cake said Woodhouse and I remembered afterwards that he spoke
like a Cabinet Minister on the eve of a Budget reserves to itself the
fullest right to deal with situations as they arise

Yeeh Bat Masquerier shook himself out of his thoughts Situations
as they arise I aint idle either But theres no use fishing till the
swims baited Youhe turned to Ollyettmanufacture very good
groundbait I always tell My peopleWhat the deuce is that

There was a burst of song from another private diningroom across the
landing It ees some ladies from the Trefoil the waiter began

Oh I know that What are they singing though

He rose and went out to be greeted by shouts of applause from that
merry company Then there was silence such as one hears in the
formroom after a masters entry Then a voice that we loved began
again Here we go gathering nuts in Maynuts in Maynuts in May

Its only Daland some nuts he explained when he returned She
says shes coming in to dessert He sat down humming the old tune to
himself and till Miss Vidal Benzaguen entered he held us speechless
with tales of the artistic temperament

We obeyed Pallant to the extent of slipping into The Bun a wary
paragraph about cows lying down and dripping at the mouth which might
be read either as an unkind libel or in the hands of a capable lawyer
as a piece of faithful naturestudy

And besides said Ollyett we allude to gravid polled Angus I am
advised that no action can lie in respect of virgin Shorthorns Pallant
wants us to come to the House tonight Hes got us places for the
Strangers Gallery Im beginning to like Pallant

Masquerier seems to like you I said

Yes but Im afraid of him Ollyett answered with perfect sincerity
I am Hes the Absolutely Amoral Soul Ive never met one yet

We went to the House together It happened to be an Irish afternoon and
as soon as I had got the cries and the faces a little sorted out I
gathered there were grievances in the air but how many of them was
beyond me

Its all right said Ollyett of the trained ear Theyve shut their
ports againstoh yesexport of Irish cattle Footandmouth disease at
Ballyhellion I see Pallants idea

The House was certainly all mouth for the moment but as I could feel
quite in earnest A Minister with a piece of typewritten paper seemed to
be fending off volleys of insults He reminded me somehow of a nervous
huntsman breaking up a fox in the face of rabid hounds

Its questiontime Theyre asking questions said Ollyett Look
Pallants up

There was no mistaking it His voice which his enemies said was his one
parliamentary asset silenced the hubbub as toothache silences mere
singing in the ears He said

Arising out of that may I ask if any special consideration has
recently been shown in regard to any suspected outbreak of this disease
on this side of the Channel

He raised his hand it held a noon edition of The Bun We had thought
it best to drop the paragraph out of the later ones He would have
continued but something in a grey frockcoat roared and bounded on a
bench opposite and waved another Bun It was Sir Thomas Ingell

As the owner of the herd so dastardly implicated His voice was
drowned in shouts of Orderthe Irish leading

Whats wrong I asked Ollyett Hes got his hat on his head hasnt
he

Yes but his wrath should have been put as a question

Arising out of that Mr Speaker Sirrr Sir Thomas bellowed through a
lull are you aware thatthat all this is a conspiracypart of a
dastardly conspiracy to make Huckley ridiculousto make us
ridiculous Part of a deeplaid plot to make me ridiculous Mr
Speaker Sir

The mans face showed almost black against his white whiskers and he
struck out swimmingly with his arms His vehemence puzzled and held the
House for an instant and the Speaker took advantage of it to lift his
pack from Ireland to a new scent He addressed Sir Thomas Ingell in
tones of measured rebuke meant also I imagine for the whole House
which lowered its hackles at the word Then Pallant shocked and pained
I can only express my profound surprise that in response to my simple
question the honourable member should have thought fit to indulge in a
personal attack If I have in any way offended

Again the Speaker intervened for it appeared that he regulated these
matters

He too expressed surprise and Sir Thomas sat back in a hush of
reprobation that seemed to have the chill of the centuries behind it
The Empires work was resumed

Beautiful said I and I felt hot and cold up my back

And now well publish his letter said Ollyett

We didon the heels of his carefully reported outburst We made no
comment With that rare instinct for grasping the heart of a situation
which is the mark of the AngloSaxon all our contemporaries and I
should say twothirds of our correspondents demanded how such a person
could be made more ridiculous than he had already proved himself to be
But beyond spelling his name Injle we alone refused to hit a man when
he was down

Theres no need said Ollyett The whole press is on the huckle from
end to end

Even Woodhouse was a little astonished at the ease with which it had
come about and said as much

Rot said Ollyett We havent really begun Huckley isnt news yet

What do you mean said Woodhouse who had grown to have great respect
for his young but by no means distant connection

Mean By the grace of God Master Ridley I mean to have it so that
when Huckley turns over in its sleep Reuters and the Press Association
jump out of bed to cable Then he went off at score about certain
restorations in Huckley Church which he saidand he seemed to spend
his every weekend therehad been perpetrated by the Rectors
predecessor who had abolished a leperwindow or a squinchhole
whatever these may be to institute a lavatory in the vestry It did
not strike me as stuff for which Reuters or the Press Association would
lose much sleep and I left him declaiming to Woodhouse about a
fourteenthcentury font which he said he had unearthed in the sextons
toolshed

My methods were more on the lines of peaceful penetration An odd copy
in The Buns ragandbone library of Hones EveryDay Book had
revealed to me the existence of a village dance founded like all
village dances on Druidical mysteries connected with the Solar Solstice
which is always unchallengeable and Midsummer Morning which is dewy
and refreshing to the London eye For this I take no creditHone being
a mine any one can workbut that I rechristened that dance after I
had revised it The Gubby is my title to immortal fame It was still
to be witnessed I wrote in all its poignant purity at Huckley that
last home of significant medival survivals and I fell so in love with
my creation that I kept it back for days enamelling and burnishing

Yous better put it in said Ollyett at last Its time we asserted
ourselves again The other fellows are beginning to poach You saw that
thing in the Pinnacle about Sir Thomass Model Village He must have
got one of their chaps down to do it

Nothing like the wounds of a friend I said That account of the
nonalcoholic pub alone was

I liked the bit best about the whitetiled laundry and the Fallen
Virgins who wash Sir Thomass dress shirts Our side couldnt come
within a mile of that you know We havent the proper flair for
sexual slobber

Thats what Im always saying I retorted Leave em alone The other
fellows are doing our work for us now Besides I want to touch up my
Gubby Dance a little more

No Youll spoil it Lets shove it in today For one thing its
Literature I dont go in for compliments as you know but etc etc

I had a healthy suspicion of young Ollyett in every aspect but though I
knew that I should have to pay for it I fell to his flattery and my
priceless article on the Gubby Dance appeared Next Saturday he asked
me to bring out The Bun in his absence which I naturally assumed
would be connected with the little maroon sidecar I was wrong

On the following Monday I glanced at The Cake at breakfasttime to
make sure as usual of her inferiority to my beloved but unremunerative
Bun I opened on a heading The Village that Voted the Earth was
Flat I read  I read that the Geoplanarian Societya society
devoted to the proposition that the earth is flathad held its Annual
Banquet and Exercises at Huckley on Saturday when after convincing
addresses amid scenes of the greatest enthusiasm Huckley village had
decided by an unanimous vote of  that the earth was flat I do not
remember that I breathed again till I had finished the two columns of
description that followed Only one man could have written them They
were flawlesscrisp nervous austere yet human poignant vital
arrestingmost distinctly arrestingdynamic enough to shift a
cityand quotable by whole sticks at a time And there was a leader a
grave and poised leader which tore me in two with mirth until I
remembered that I had been left outinfamously and unjustifiably
dropped I went to Ollyetts rooms He was breakfasting and to do him
justice looked consciencestricken

It wasnt my fault he began It was Bat Masquerier I swear I
would have asked you to come if

Never mind that I said Its the best bit of work youve ever done
or will do Did any of it happen

Happen Heavens Dyou think even I could have invented it

Is it exclusive to The Cake I cried

It cost Bat Masquerier two thousand Ollyett replied Dyou think
hed let any one else in on that But I give you my sacred word I knew
nothing about it till he asked me to come down and cover it He had
Huckley posted in three colours The Geoplanarians Annual Banquet and
Exercises Yes he invented Geoplanarians He wanted Huckley to think
it meant aeroplanes Yes I know that there is a real Society that
thinks the worlds flatthey ought to be grateful for the liftbut Bat
made his own He did He created the whole show I tell you He swept
out half his Halls for the job Think of thaton a Saturday Theywe
went down in motor charbancsthree of emone pink one primrose
and one forgetmenot bluetwenty people in each one and The Earth
is Flat on each side and across the back I went with Teddy Rickets
and Lafone from the Trefoil and both the Silhouette Sisters andwait
a minutethe Crossleigh Trio You know the EveryDay Dramas Trio at
the JocundaAda Crossleigh Bunt Crossleigh and little Victorine
Them And there was Hoke Ramsden the lightningchange chap in Morgiana
and Drexeland there was Billy Turpeen Yes you know him The North
London Star Im the Referee that got himself disliked at Blackheath
That chap And there was Mackayethat oneeyed Scotch fellow that all
Glasgow is crazy about Talk of subordinating yourself for Arts sake
Mackaye was the earnest inquirer who got converted at the end of the
meeting And there was quite a lot of girls I didnt know andoh
yesthere was Dal Dal Benzaguen herself We sat together going and
coming Shes all the darling there ever was She sent you her love and
she told me to tell you that she wont forget about Nellie Farren She
says youve given her an ideal to work for She Oh she was the Lady
Secretary to the Geoplanarians of course I forget who were in the
other brakesprovincial stars mostlybut they played up gorgeously
The art of the musichalls changed since your day They didnt overdo
it a bit You see people who believe the earth is flat dont dress
quite like other people You may have noticed that I hinted at that in
my account Its a rather flatfronted Ionic styleneoVictorian
except for the bustles Dal told mebut Dal looked heavenly in it
So did little Victorine And there was a girl in the blue brakeshes a
provincialbut shes coming to town this winter and shell knock
emWinnie Deans Remember that She told Huckley how she had suffered
for the Cause as a governess in a rich family where they believed that
the world is round and how she threw up her job sooner than teach
immoral geography That was at the overflow meeting outside the
Baptist chapel She knocked em to sawdust We must look out for
Winnie But Lafone Lafone was beyond everything Impact
personalityconvictionthe whole bag o tricks He sweated conviction
Gad he convinced me while he was speaking Him He was President of
the Geoplanarians of course Havent you read my account It is an
infernally plausible theory After all no one has actually proved the
earth is round have they

Never mind the earth What about Huckley

Oh Huckley got tight Thats the worst of these model villages if you
let em smell firewater Theres one alcoholic pub in the place that
Sir Thomas cant get rid of Bat made it his base He sent down the
banquet in two motor lorriesdinner for five hundred and drinks for ten
thousand Huckley voted all right Dont you make any mistake about
that No vote no dinner A unanimous voteexactly as Ive said At
least the Rector and the Doctor were the only dissentients We didnt
count them Oh yes Sir Thomas was there He came and grinned at us
through his park gates Hell grin worse today Theres an aniline dye
that you rub through a stencilplate that eats about a foot into any
stone and wears good to the last Bat had both the lodgegates
stencilled The Earth is flat and all the barns and walls they could
get at Oh Lord but Huckley was drunk We had to fill em up to make
em forgive us for not being aeroplanes Unthankful yokels Dyou
realise that Emperors couldnt have commanded the talent Bat decanted on
em Why Dal alone was And by eight oclock not even a bit of
paper left The whole show packed up and gone and Huckley hooraying
for the earth being flat

Very good I began I am as you know a onethird proprietor of
The Bun

I didnt forget that Ollyett interrupted That was uppermost in my
mind all the time Ive got a special account for The Bun todayits
an idylland just to show how I thought of you I told Dal coming
home about your Gubby Dance and she told Winnie Winnie came back in
our charbanc After a bit we had to get out and dance it in a field
Its quite a dance the way we did itand Lafone invented a sort of
gorilla lockstep procession at the end Bat had sent down a filmchap on
the chance of getting something He was the son of a clergymana most
dynamic personality He said there isnt anything for the cinema in
meetings qua meetingsthey lack action Films are a branch of art by
themselves But he went wild over the Gubby He said it was like Peters
vision at Joppa He took about a million feet of it Then I photoed it
exclusive for The Bun Ive sent em in already only remember we must
eliminate Winnies left leg in the first figure Its too arresting
And there you are But I tell you Im afraid of Bat That mans the
Personal Devil He did it all He didnt even come down himself He said
hed distract his people

Why didnt he ask me to come I persisted

Because he said youd distract me He said he wanted my brains on ice
He got em I believe its the best thing Ive ever done He reached
for The Cake and reread it luxuriously Yes out and away the
bestsupremely quotable he concluded andafter another surveyBy
God what a genius I was yesterday

I would have been angry but I had not the time That morning Press
agencies grovelled to me in The Bun office for leave to use certain
photos which they understood I controlled of a certain village
dance When I had sent the fifth man away on the edge of tears my
selfrespect came back a little Then there was The Buns poster to
get out Art being elimination I fined it down to two words one too
many as it provedThe Gubby in red at which our manager
protested but by five oclock he told me that I was the Napoleon of
Fleet Street Ollyetts account in The Bun of the Geoplanarians
Exercises and Love Feast lacked the supreme shock of his version in The
Cake but it bruised more while the photos of The Gubby which with
Winnies left leg was why I had set the doubtful press to work so
early were beyond praise and next day beyond price But even then I
did not understand

A week later I think it was Bat Masquerier telephoned to me to come to
the Trefoil

Its your turn now he said Im not asking Ollyett Come to the
stagebox

I went and as Bats guest was received as Royalty is not We sat well
back and looked out on the packed thousands It was Morgiana and
Drexel that fluid and electric review which Batthough he gave Lafone
the creditreally created

Yees said Bat dreamily after Morgiana had given the nasty jar to
the Forty Thieves in their forty oil combinations As you say Ive
got em and I can hold em What a man does doesnt matter much and how
he does it dont matter either Its the whenthe psychological
moment Press cant make up for it money cant brains cant A lots
luck but all the rest is genius Im not speaking about My people now
Im talking of Myself

Then Dalshe was the only one who daredknocked at the door and stood
behind us all alive and panting as Morgiana Lafone was carrying the
policecourt scene and the house was ripped up crossways with laughter

Ah Tell a fellow now she asked me for the twentieth time did you
love Nellie Farren when you were young

Did we love her I answered If the earth and the sky and the
seaThere were three million of us Dal and we worshipped her

How did she get it across Dal went on

She was Nellie The houses used to coo over her when she came on

Ive had a good deal but Ive never been cooed over yet said Dal
wistfully

It isnt the how its the when Bat repeated Ah

He leaned forward as the house began to rock and peal fullthroatedly
Dal fled A sinuous and silent procession was filing into the
policecourt to a scarcely audible accompaniment It was dressedbut
the world and all its picturepalaces know how it was dressed It
danced and it danced and it danced the dance which bit all humanity in
the leg for half a year and it wound up with the lockstep finale that
mowed the house down in swathes sobbing and aching Somebody in the
gallery moaned Oh Gord the Gubby and we heard the word run like a
shudder for they had not a full breath left among them Then Dal came
on an electric star in her dark hair the diamonds flashing in her
threeinch heelsa vision that made no sign for thirty counted seconds
while the policecourt scene dissolved behind her into Morgianas
Manicure Palace and they recovered themselves The star on her forehead
went out and a soft light bathed her as she tookslowly slowly to the
croon of adoring stringsthe eighteen paces forward We saw her first
as a queen alone next as a queen for the first time conscious of her
subjects and at the end when her hands fluttered as a woman
delighted awed not a little but transfigured and illuminated with
sheer compelling affection and goodwill I caught the broken mutter of
welcomethe coo which is more than tornadoes of applause It died and
rose and died again lovingly

Shes got it across Bat whispered Ive never seen her like this I
told her to light up the star but I was wrong and she knew it Shes
an artist

Dal you darling some one spoke not loudly but it carried through
the house

Thank you Dal answered and in that broken tone one heard the last
fetter riveted Good evening boys Ive just come fromnowwhere the
dooce was it I have come from She turned to the impassive files of
the Gubby dancers and went on Ah so good of you to remind me you
dear bunfaced things Ive just come from the villageThe Village
that Voted the Earth was Flat

She swept into that song with the full orchestra It devastated the
habitable earth for the next six months Imagine then what its rage
and pulse must have been at the incandescent hour of its birth She only
gave the chorus once At the end of the second verse Are you with
me boys she cried and the house tore it clean away from
herEarth was flatEarth was flat Flat as my hatFlatter than
thatdrowning all but the bassoons and doublebasses that marked
the word

Wonderful I said to Bat And its only Nuts in May with
variations

Yesbut I did the variations he replied

At the last verse she gestured to Carlini the conductor who threw her
up his baton She caught it with a boys ease Are you with me she
cried once more andthe maddened house behind herabolished all the
instruments except the guttural belch of the doublebasses on
EarthThe Village that voted the Earth was flatEarth was
flat It was delirium Then she picked up the Gubby dancers and led
them in a clattering improvised lockstep thrice round the stage till her
last kick sent her diamondhiked shoe catherinewheeling to the
electrolier

I saw the forest of hands raised to catch it heard the roaring and
stamping pass through hurricanes to full typhoon heard the song pinned
down by the faithful doublebasses as the bulldog pins down the
bellowing bull overbear even those till at last the curtain fell and
Bat took me round to her dressingroom where she lay spent after her
seventh call Still the song through all those whitewashed walls
shook the reinforced concrete of the Trefoil as steam piledrivers shake
the flanks of a dock

Im all outfirst time in my life Ah Tell a fellow now did I get it
across she whispered huskily

You know you did I replied as she dipped her nose deep in a beaker of
barleywater They cooed over you

Bat nodded And poor Nellies deadin Africa aint it

I hope Ill die before they stop cooing said Dal

Earth was flatEarth was flat Now it was more like minepumps
in flood

Theyll have the house down if you dont take another some one
called

Bless em said Dal and went out for her eighth when in the face of
that cataract she said yawning I dont know how you feel children
but Im dead You be quiet

Hold a minute said Bat to me Ive got to hear how it went in the
provinces Winnie Deans had it in Manchester and Ramsden at
Glasgowand there are all the films too I had rather a heavy
weekend

The telephones presently reassured him

Itll do said he And he said my home address was Jerusalem He
left me humming the refrain of The Holy City Like Ollyett I found
myself afraid of that man

When I got out into the street and met the disgorging picturepalaces
capering on the pavements and humming it for he had put the gramophones
on with the films and when I saw far to the south the red electrics
flash Gubby across the Thames I feared more than ever

                                   

A few days passed which were like nothing except perhaps a suspense of
fever in which the sick man perceives the searchlights of the worlds
assembled navies in act to converge on one minute fragment of
wreckageone only in all the black and agonystrewn sea Then those
beams focussed themselves Earth as we knew itthe full circuit of our
orblaid the weight of its impersonal and searing curiosity on this
Huckley which had voted that it was flat It asked for news about
Huckleywhere and what it might be and how it talkedit knew how it
dancedand how it thought in its wonderful soul And then in all the
zealous merciless press Huckley was laid out for it to look at as a
drop of pond water is exposed on the sheet of a magiclantern show But
Huckleys sheet was only coterminous with the use of type among mankind
For the precise moment that was necessary Fate ruled it that there
should be nothing of first importance in the worlds idle eye One
atrocious murder a political crisis an incautious or heady
continental statesman the mere catarrh of a king would have wiped out
the significance of our message as a passing cloud annuls the urgent
helio But it was halcyon weather in every respect Ollyett and I did
not need to lift our little fingers any more than the Alpine climber
whose last sentence has unkeyed the arch of the avalanche The thing
roared and pulverised and swept beyond eyesight all by itselfall by
itself And once well away the fall of kingdoms could not have
diverted it

Ours is after all a kindly earth While The Song ran and raped it with
the cataleptic kick of Tararaboomdeay multiplied by the West
African significance of Everybodys doing it plus twice the infernal
elementality of a certain tune in Dona et Gamma when for all
practical purposes literary dramatic artistic social municipal
political commercial and administrative the Earth was flat the
Rector of Huckley wrote to usagain as a lover of accuracyto point
out that the Huckley vote on the alleged flatness of this scene of our
labours here below was not unanimous he and the doctor having voted
against it And the great Baron Reuter himself I am sure it could have
been none other flashed that letter in full to the front back and
both wings of this scene of our labours For Huckley was News The Bun
also contributed a photograph which cost me some trouble to fake

We are a vital nation said Ollyett while we were discussing affairs
at a Bat dinner Only an Englishman could have written that letter at
this present juncture

It reminded me of a tourist in the Cave of the Winds under Niagara
Just one figure in a mackintosh But perhaps you saw our photo I
said proudly

Yes Bat replied Ive been to Niagara too And hows Huckley taking
it

They dont quite understand of course said Ollyett But its
bringing pots of money into the place Ever since the motorbus
excursions were started

I didnt know they had been said Pallant

Oh yes Motor charbancsuniformed guides and keybugles included
Theyre getting a bit fed up with the tune there nowadays
Ollyett added

They play it under his windows dont they Bat asked He cant stop
the right of way across his park

He cannot Ollyett answered By the way Woodhouse Ive bought that
font for you from the sexton I paid fifteen pounds for it

What am I supposed to do with it asked Woodhouse

You give it to the Victoria and Albert Museum It is fourteenthcentury
work all right You can trust me

Is it worth itnow said Pallant Not that Im weakening but merely
as a matter of tactics

But this is true said Ollyett Besides it is my hobby I always
wanted to be an architect Ill attend to it myself Its too serious
for The Bun and miles too good for The Cake

He broke ground in a ponderous architectural weekly which had never
heard of Huckley There was no passion in his statement but mere fact
backed by a wide range of authorities He established beyond doubt that
the old font at Huckley had been thrown out on Sir Thomass
instigation twenty years ago to make room for a new one of Bath stone
adorned with Limoges enamels and that it had lain ever since in a
corner of the sextons shed He proved with learned men to support him
that there was only one other font in all England to compare with it So
Woodhouse bought it and presented it to a grateful South Kensington
which said it would see the earth still flatter before it returned the
treasure to purblind Huckley Bishops by the benchful and most of the
Royal Academy not to mention Margaritas ante Porcos wrote fervently
to the papers Punch based a political cartoon on it the Times a
third leader The Lust of Newness and the Spectator a scholarly and
delightful middle Village Hausmania The vast amused outside world
said in all its tongues and types Of course This is just what Huckley
would do And neither Sir Thomas nor the Rector nor the sexton nor any
one else wrote to deny it

You see said Ollyett this is much more of a blow to Huckley than it
looksbecause every word of its true Your Gubby dance was
inspiration I admit but it hadnt its roots in

Two hemispheres and four continents so far I pointed out

Its roots in the hearts of Huckley was what I was going to say Why
dont you ever come down and look at the place Youve never seen it
since we were stopped there

Ive only my weekends free I said and you seem to spend yours
there pretty regularlywith the sidecar I was afraid

Oh thats all right he said cheerily Were quite an old engaged
couple now As a matter of fact it happened after the gravid polled
Angus business Come along this Saturday Woodhouse says hell run us
down after lunch He wants to see Huckley too

Pallant could not accompany us but Bat took his place

Its odd said Bat that none of us except Ollyett has ever set eyes
on Huckley since that time Thats what I always tell My people Local
colour is all right after youve got your idea Before that its a mere
nuisance He regaled us on the way down with panoramic views of the
successgeographical and financialof The Gubby and The Song

By the way said he Ive assigned Dal all the gramophone rights of
The Earth Shes a born artist Hadnt sense enough to hit me for
tripledubs the morning after Shed have taken it out in coos

Bless her And whatll she make out of the gramophone rights I asked

Lord knows he replied Ive made fiftyfour thousand my little end
of the business and its only just beginning Hear that

A shellpink motorbrake roared up behind us to the music on a keybugle
of The Village that Voted the Earth was Flat In a few minutes we
overtook another in natural wood whose occupants were singing it
through their noses

I dont know that agency It must be Cooks said Ollyett They do
suffer We were never out of earshot of the tune the rest of the way
to Huckley

Though I knew it would be so I was disappointed with the actual aspect
of the spot we hadit is not too much to saycreated in the face of
the nations The alcoholic pub the village green the Baptist chapel
the church the sextons shed the Rectory whence the sowonderful
letters had come Sir Thomass park gatepillars still violently
declaring The Earth is flat were as mean as average as ordinary
as the photograph of a room where a murder has been committed Ollyett
who of course knew the place specially well made the most of it to
us Bat who had employed it as a backcloth to one of his own dramas
dismissed it as a thing used and emptied but Woodhouse expressed my
feelings when he said Is that allafter all weve done

I know said Ollyett soothingly Like that strange song I heard
Apollo sing When Ilion like a mist rose into towers Ive felt the
same sometimes though it has been Paradise for me But they
do suffer

The fourth brake in thirty minutes had just turned into Sir Thomass
park to tell the Hall that The Earth was flat a knot of obviously
American tourists were kodaking his lodgegates while the teashop
opposite the lychgate was full of people buying postcards of the old
font as it had lain twenty years in the sextons shed We went to the
alcoholic pub and congratulated the proprietor

Its bringin money to the place said he But in a sense you can buy
money too dear It isnt doin us any good People are laughin at us
Thats what theyre doin Now with regard to that Vote of ours you
may have heard talk about

For Gorze sake chuck that votin business cried an elderly man at
the door Moneygettin or no moneygettin were fed up with it

Well I do think said the publican shifting his ground I do think
Sir Thomas might ha managed better in some things

He tole methe elderly man shouldered his way to the barhe tole
me twenty years ago to take an lay that font in my toolshed He tole
me so himself An now after twenty years me own wife makin me out
little better than the common angman

Thats the sexton the publican explained His good lady sells the
postcardsif you avent got some But we feel Sir Thomas might ha
done better

Whats he got to do with it said Woodhouse

Theres nothin we can trace ome to im in so many words but we think
he might ave saved us the font business Now in regard to that votin
business

Chuck it Oh chuck it the sexton roared or youll ave me cuttin
my throat at cockcrow Eres another parcel of funmakers

A motorbrake had pulled up at the door and a multitude of men and
women immediately descended We went out to look They bore rolled
banners a readingdesk in three pieces and I specially noticed a
collapsible harmonium such as is used on ships at sea

Salvation Army I said though I saw no uniforms

Two of them unfurled a banner between poles which bore the legend The
Earth is flat Woodhouse and I turned to Bat He shook his head No
no Not me If I had only seen their costumes in advance

Good Lord said Ollyett Its the genuine Society

The company advanced on the green with the precision of people well
broke to these movements Sceneshifters could not have been quicker
with the threepiece rostrum nor stewards with the harmonium Almost
before its crosslegs had been kicked into their catches certainly
before the tourists by the lodgegates had begun to move over a woman
sat down to it and struck up a hymn

     Hear ther truth our tongues are telling
       Spread ther light from shore to shore
     God hath given man a dwelling
       Flat and flat for evermore

     When ther Primal Dark retreated
       When ther deeps were undesigned
     He with rule and level meted
       Habitation for mankind

I saw sick envy on Bats face Curse Nature he muttered She gets
ahead of you every time To think I forgot hymns and a harmonium

Then came the chorus

     Hear ther truth our tongues are telling
       Spread ther light from shore to shore
     Oh be faithful Oh be truthful
       Earth is flat for evermore

They sang several verses with the fervour of Christians awaiting their
lions Then there were growlings in the air The sexton embraced by the
landlord twostepped out of the pubdoor Each was trying to outroar
the other Apologising in advarnce for what he says the landlord
shouted Youd better go away here the sexton began to speak words
This isnt the time nor yet the place forfor any more o this chat

The crowd thickened I saw the village policesergeant come out of his
cottage buckling his belt

But surely said the woman at the harmonium there must be some
mistake We are not suffragettes

Damn it Theyd be a change cried the sexton You get out of this
Dont talk I cant stand it for one Get right out or well
font you

The crowd which was being recruited from every house in sight echoed the
invitation The sergeant pushed forward A man beside the readingdesk
said But surely we are among dear friends and sympathisers Listen to
me for a moment

It was the moment that a passing charbanc chose to strike into The
Song The effect was instantaneous Bat Ollyett and I who by divers
roads have learned the psychology of crowds retreated towards the
tavern door Woodhouse the newspaper proprietor anxious I presume to
keep touch with the public dived into the thick of it Every one else
told the Society to go away at once When the lady at the harmonium I
began to understand why it is sometimes necessary to kill women pointed
at the stencilled park pillars and called them the cromlechs of our
common faith there was a snarl and a rush The policesergeant checked
it but advised the Society to keep on going The Society withdrew into
the brake fighting as it were a rearguard action of oratory up each
step The collapsed harmonium was hauled in last and with the perfect
unreason of crowds they cheered it loudly till the chauffeur slipped
in his clutch and sped away Then the crowd broke up congratulating all
concerned except the sexton who was held to have disgraced his office
by having sworn at ladies We strolled across the green towards
Woodhouse who was talking to the policesergeant near the parkgates
We were not twenty yards from him when we saw Sir Thomas Ingell emerge
from the lodge and rush furiously at Woodhouse with an uplifted stick
at the same time shrieking Ill teach you to laugh you but Ollyett
has the record of the language By the time we reached them Sir Thomas
was on the ground Woodhouse very white held the walkingstick and was
saying to the sergeant

I give this person in charge for assault

But good Lord said the sergeant whiter than Woodhouse Its Sir
Thomas

Whoever it is it isnt fit to be at large said Woodhouse The crowd
suspecting something wrong began to reassemble and all the English
horror of a row in public moved us headed by the sergeant inside the
lodge We shut both parkgates and lodgedoor

You saw the assault sergeant Woodhouse went on You can testify I
used no more force than was necessary to protect myself You can testify
that I have not even damaged this persons property Here take your
stick you You heard the filthy language he used

II cant say I did the sergeant stammered

Oh but we did said Ollyett and repeated it to the apronveiled
horror of the lodgekeepers wife

Sir Thomas on a hard kitchen chair began to talk He said he had stood
enough of being photographed like a wild beast and expressed loud
regret that he had not killed that man who was conspiring with the
sergeant to laugh at him

Ad you ever seen im before Sir Thomas the sergeant asked

No But its time an example was made here Ive never seen the sweep
in my life

I think it was Bat Masqueriers magnetic eye that recalled the past to
him for his face changed and his jaw dropped But I have he groaned
I remember now

Here a writhing man entered by the back door He was he said the
village solicitor I do not assert that he licked Woodhouses boots but
we should have respected him more if he had and been done with it His
notion was that the matter could be accommodated arranged and
compromised for gold and yet more gold The sergeant thought so too
Woodhouse undeceived them both To the sergeant he said Will you or
will you not enter the charge To the village solicitor he gave the
name of his lawyers at which the man wrung his hands and cried Oh
Sir T Sir T in a miserable falsetto for it was a Bat Masquerier of
a firm They conferred together in tragic whispers

I dont dive after Dickens said Ollyett to Bat and me by the window
but every time I get into a row I notice the policecourt always
fills up with his characters

Ive noticed that too said Bat But the odd thing is you mustnt
give the public straight Dickensnot in My business I wonder why
that is

Then Sir Thomas got his second wind and cursed the day that he or it
may have been we were born I feared that though he was a Radical he
might apologise and since he was an MP might lie his way out of the
difficulty But he was utterly and truthfully beside himself He asked
foolish questionssuch as what we were doing in the village at all and
how much blackmail Woodhouse expected to make out of him But neither
Woodhouse nor the sergeant nor the writhing solicitor listened The
upshot of their talk in the chimneycorner was that Sir Thomas stood
engaged to appear next Monday before his brother magistrates on charges
of assault disorderly conduct and language calculated etc Ollyett
was specially careful about the language

Then we left The village looked very pretty in the late lightpretty
and tuneful as a nest of nightingales

Youll turn up on Monday I hope said Woodhouse when we reached
town That was his only allusion to the affair

So we turned upthrough a world still singing that the Earth was
flatat the little claycoloured markettown with the large Corn
Exchange and the small Jubilee memorial We had some difficulty in
getting seats in the court Woodhouses imported London lawyer was a man
of commanding personality with a voice trained to convey blasting
imputations by tone When the case was called he rose and stated his
clients intention not to proceed with the charge His client he went
on to say had not entertained and of course in the circumstances
could not have entertained any suggestion of accepting on behalf of
public charities any moneys that might have been offered to him on the
part of Sir Thomass estate At the same time no one acknowledged more
sincerely than his client the spirit in which those offers had been made
by those entitled to make them But as a matter of facthere he became
the man of the world colloguing with his equalscertainerdetails
had come to his clients knowledge since the lamentable outburst
which  He shrugged his shoulders Nothing was served by going into
them but he ventured to say that had those painful circumstances only
been known earlier his client wouldagain of coursenever have
dreamedA gesture concluded the sentence and the ensnared Bench looked
at Sir Thomas with new and withdrawing eyes Frankly as they could see
it would be nothing less than cruelty to proceed further with
thiserunfortunate affair He asked leave therefore to withdraw the
charge in toto and at the same time to express his clients deepest
sympathy with all who had been in any way distressed as his client had
been by the fact and the publicity of proceedings which he could of
course again assure them that his client would never have dreamed of
instituting if as he hoped he had made plain certain facts had been
before his client at the time when But he had said enough For his
fee it seemed to me that he had

Heaven inspired Sir Thomass lawyerall of a sweat lest his clients
language should come outto rise up and thank him Then Sir
Thomasnot yet aware what leprosy had been laid upon him but grateful
to escape on any termsfollowed suit He was heard in interested
silence and people drew back a pace as Gehazi passed forth

You hit hard said Bat to Woodhouse afterwards His own people think
hes mad

You dont say so Ill show you some of his letters tonight at
dinner he replied

He brought them to the Red Amber Room of the Chop Suey We forgot to be
amazed as till then we had been amazed over the Song or The Gubby
or the full tide of Fate that seemed to run only for our sakes It did
not even interest Ollyett that the verb to huckle had passed into the
English leaderwriters language We were studying the interior of a
soul flashlighted to its grimiest corners by the dread of losing its
position

And then it thanked you didnt it for dropping the case said
Pallant

Yes and it sent me a telegram to confirm Woodhouse turned to Bat
Now dyou think I hit too hard he asked

Noo said Bat After allIm talking of every ones business
nowone cant ever do anything in Art that comes up to Nature in any
game in life Just think how this thing has

Just let me run through that little case of yours again said Pallant
and picked up The Bun which had it set out in full

Any chance of Dal looking in on us tonight Ollyett began

Shes occupied with her Art too Bat answered bitterly Whats the
use of Art Tell me some one A barrelorgan outside promptly pointed
out that the Earth was flat The gramophones killing street organs
but I let loose a hundredandseventyfour of those hurdygurdys twelve
hours after The Song said Bat Not counting the Provinces His face
brightened a little

Look here said Pallant over the paper I dont suppose you or those
asinine JPs knew itbut your lawyer ought to have known that youve
all put your foot in it most confoundedly over this assault case

Whats the matter said Woodhouse

Its ludicrous Its insane There isnt two pennorth of legality in
the whole thing Of course you could have withdrawn the charge but the
way you went about it is childishbesides being illegal What on earth
was the Chief Constable thinking of

Oh he was a friend of Sir Thomass They all were for that matter I
replied

He ought to be hanged So ought the Chairman of the Bench Im talking
as a lawyer now

Why what have we been guilty of Misprision of treason or compounding
a felonyor what said Ollyett

Ill tell you later Pallant went back to the paper with knitted
brows smiling unpleasantly from time to time At last he laughed

Thank you he said to Woodhouse It ought to be pretty usefulfor
us

What dyou mean said Ollyett

For our side They are all Rads who are mixed up in thisfrom the
Chief Constable down There must be a Question There must be a
Question

Yes but I wanted the charge withdrawn in my own way Woodhouse
insisted

Thats nothing to do with the case Its the legality of your silly
methods You wouldnt understand if I talked till morning He began to
pace the room his hands behind him I wonder if I can get it through
our Whips thick head that its a chance That comes of stuffing the
Bench with radical tinkers he muttered

Oh sit down said Woodhouse

Wheres your lawyer to be found now he jerked out

At the Trefoil said Bat promptly I gave him the stagebox for
tonight Hes an artist too

Then Im going to see him said Pallant Properly handled this ought
to be a godsend for our side He withdrew without apology

Certainly this thing keeps on opening up and up I remarked inanely

Its beyond me said Bat I dont think if Id known Id have
ever  Yes I would though He said my home address was

It was his tonehis tone Ollyett almost shouted Woodhouse said
nothing but his face whitened as he brooded

Well any way Bat went on Im glad I always believed in God and
Providence and all those things Else I should lose my nerve Weve put
it over the whole worldthe full extent of the geographical globe We
couldnt stop it if we wanted to now Its got to burn itself out Im
not in charge any more What dyou expectll happen next Angels

I expected nothing Nothing that I expected approached what I got
Politics are not my concern but for the moment since it seemed that
they were going to huckle with the rest I took an interest in them
They impressed me as a dogs life without a dogs decencies and I was
confirmed in this when an unshaven and unwashen Pallant called on me at
ten oclock one morning begging for a bath and a couch

Bail too I asked He was in evening dress and his eyes were sunk feet
in his head

No he said hoarsely All night sitting Fifteen divisions Nother
tonight Your place was nearer than mine so He began to undress
in the hall

When he awoke at one oclock he gave me lurid accounts of what he said
was history but which was obviously collective hysteria There had been
a political crisis He and his fellow MPs had done thingsI never
quite got at the thingsfor eighteen hours on end and the pitiless
Whips were even then at the telephones to herd em up to another
dogfight So he snorted and grew hot all over again while he might have
been resting

Im going to pitch in my question about that miscarriage of justice at
Huckley this afternoon if you care to listen to it he said Itll be
absolutely thrown awayin our present state I told em so but its my
only chance for weeks Praps Woodhouse would like to come

Im sure he would Anything to do with Huckley interests us I said

Itll miss fire Im afraid Both sides are absolutely cooked The
present situation has been working up for some time You see the row was
bound to come etc etc and he flew off the handle once more

I telephoned to Woodhouse and we went to the House together It was a
dull sticky afternoon with thunder in the air For some reason or
other each side was determined to prove its virtue and endurance to the
utmost I heard men snarling about it all round me If they wont spare
us well show em no mercy Break the brutes up from the start They
cant stand late hours Come on No shirking I know youve had a
Turkish bath were some of the sentences I caught on our way The House
was packed already and one could feel the negative electricity of a
jaded crowd wrenching at ones own nerves and depressing the
afternoon soul

This is bad Woodhouse whispered Therell be a row before theyve
finished Look at the Front Benches And he pointed out little personal
signs by which I was to know that each man was on edge He might have
spared himself The House was ready to snap before a bone had been
thrown A sullen minister rose to reply to a staccato question His
supporters cheered defiantly None o that None o that came from
the Back Benches I saw the Speakers face stiffen like the face of a
helmsman as he humours a hardmouthed yacht after a sudden following
sea The trouble was barely met in time There came a fresh apparently
causeless gust a few minutes latersavage threatening but futile It
died outone could hear the sighin sudden wrathful realisation of
the dreary hours ahead and the ship of state drifted on

Then Pallantand the raw House winced at the torture of his
voicerose It was a twentyline question studded with legal
technicalities The gist of it was that he wished to know whether the
appropriate Minister was aware that there had been a grave miscarriage
of justice on such and such a date at such and such a place before
such and such justices of the peace in regard to a case which arose

I heard one desperate weary damn float up from the pit of that
torment Pallant sawed onout of certain events which occurred at the
village of Huckley

The House came to attention with a parting of the lips like a hiccough
and it flashed through my mind Pallant repeated Huckley The
village

That voted the Earth was flat A single voice from a back Bench sang
it once like a lone frog in a far pool

Earth was flat croaked another voice opposite

Earth was flat There were several Then several more

It was you understand the collective overstrained nerve of the House
snapping strand by strand to various notes as the hawser parts from
its moorings

The Village that voted the Earth was flat The tune was beginning to
shape itself More voices were raised and feet began to beat time Even
so it did not occur to me that the thing would

The Village that voted the Earth was flat It was easier now to see
who were not singing There were still a few Of a sudden and this
proves the fundamental instability of the crossbench mind a
crossbencher leaped on his seat and there played an imaginary
doublebass with tremendous maestrolike wagglings of the elbow

The last strand parted The ship of state drifted out helpless on the
rocking tide of melody

     The Village that voted the Earth was flat
      The Village that voted the Earth was flat

The Irish first conceived the idea of using their orderpapers as
funnels wherewith to reach the correct vroomvroom on Earth
Labour always conservative and respectable at a crisis stood out
longer than any other section but when it came in it was howling
syndicalism Then without distinction of Party fear of constituents
desire for office or hope of emolument the House sang at the tops and
at the bottoms of their voices swaying their stale bodies and
epileptically beating with their swelled feet They sang The Village
that voted the Earth was flat first because they wanted to and
secondlywhich is the terror of that songbecause they could not stop
For no consideration could they stop

Pallant was still standing up Some one pointed at him and they laughed
Others began to point lunging as it were in time with the tune At
this moment two persons came in practically abreast from behind the
Speakers chair and halted appalled One happened to be the Prime
Minister and the other a messenger The House with tears running down
their cheeks transferred their attention to the paralysed couple They
pointed six hundred forefingers at them They rocked they waved and
they rolled while they pointed but still they sang When they weakened
for an instant Ireland would yell Are ye with me bhoys and they
all renewed their strength like Antaeus No man could say afterwards
what happened in the Press or the Strangers Gallery It was the House
the hysterical and abandoned House of Commons that held all eyes as it
deafened all ears I saw both Front Benches bend forward some with
their foreheads on their despatchboxes the rest with their faces in
their hands and their moving shoulders jolted the House out of its last
rag of decency Only the Speaker remained unmoved The entire press of
Great Britain bore witness next day that he had not even bowed his head
The Angel of the Constitution for vain was the help of man foretold
him the exact moment at which the House would have broken into The
Gubby He is reported to have said I heard the Irish beginning to
shuffle it So I adjourned Pallants version is that he added And I
was never so grateful to a private member in all my life as I was to
Mr Pallant

He made no explanation He did not refer to orders or disorders He
simply adjourned the House till six that evening And the House
adjournedsome of it nearly on all fours

I was not correct when I said that the Speaker was the only man who did
not laugh Woodhouse was beside me all the time His face was set and
quite whiteas white they told me as Sir Thomas Ingells when he
went by request to a private interview with his Chief Whip

In The Presence



So the matter the Regimental Chaplain concluded was correct in
every way correct I am well pleased with Rutton Singh and Attar Singh
They have gathered the fruit of their lives

He folded his arms and sat down on the verandah The hot day had ended
and there was a pleasant smell of cooking along the regimental lines
where halfclad men went back and forth with leaf platters and
watergoglets The SubadarMajor in extreme undress sat on a chair as
befitted his rank the HavildarMajor his nephew leaning respectfully
against the wall The Regiment was at home and at ease in its own
quarters in its own district which takes its name from the great
Muhammadan saint Mian Mir revered by Jehangir and beloved by Guru Har
Gobind sixth of the great Sikh Gurus

Quite correct the Regimental Chaplain repeated

No Sikh contradicts his Regimental Chaplain who expounds to him the Holy
Book of the Grunth Sahib and who knows the lives and legends of all
the Gurus

The SubadarMajor bowed his grey head The HavildarMajor coughed
respectfully to attract attention and to ask leave to speak Though he
was the SubadarMajors nephew and though his father held twice as
much land as his uncle he knew his place in the scheme of things The
SubadarMajor shifted one hand with an iron bracelet on the wrist

Was there by any chance any woman at the back of it the
HavildarMajor murmured I was not here when the thing happened

Yes Yes Yes We all know that thou wast in England eating and
drinking with the Sahibs We are all surprised that thou canst still
speak Punjabi The SubadarMajors carefullytended beard bristled

There was no woman the Regimental Chaplain growled It was land
Hear you Rutton Singh and Attar Singh were the elder of four brothers
These four held land inwhat was the villages nameoh Pishapur
near Thori in the Banalu Tehsil of Patiala State where men can still
recognise right behaviour when they see it The two younger brothers
tilled the land while Rutton Singh and Attar Singh took service with
the Regiment according to the custom of the family

True true said the HavildarMajor There is the same arrangement in
all good families

Then listen again the Regimental Chaplain went on Their kin on
their mothers side put great oppression and injustice upon the two
younger brothers who stayed with the land in Patiala State Their
mothers kin loosened beasts into the four brothers crops when the
crops were green they cut the corn by force when it was ripe they
broke down the watercourses they defiled the wells and they brought
false charges in the lawcourts against all four brothers They did not
spare even the cottonseed as the saying is

Their mothers kin trusted that the young men would thus be forced by
weight of trouble and further trouble and perpetual trouble to quit
their lands in Pishapur village in Banalu Tehsil in Patiala State If
the young men ran away the land would come whole to their mothers kin
I am not a regimental schoolmaster but is it understood child

Understood said the HavildarMajor grimly Pishapur is not the only
place where the fence eats the field instead of protecting it But
perhaps there was a woman among their mothers kin

God knows said the Regimental Chaplain Woman or man or
lawcourts the young men would not be driven off the land which was
their own by inheritance They made appeal to Rutton Singh and Attar
Singh their brethren who had taken service with us in the Regiment
and so knew the world to help them in their long war against their
mothers kin in Pishapur For that reason because their own land and
the honour of their house was dear to them Rutton Singh and Attar Singh
needs must very often ask for leave to go to Patiala and attend to the
lawsuits and cattlepoundings there

It was not look you as though they went back to their own village and
sat garlanded with jasmine in honour upon chairs before the elders
under the trees They went back always to perpetual trouble either of
lawsuits or theft or strayed cattle and they sat on thorns

I knew it said the SubadarMajor Life was bitter for them both But
they were wellconducted men It was not hard to get them their leave
from the Colonel Sahib

They spoke to me also said the Chaplain Let him who desires the
four great gifts apply himself to the words of holy men That is
written Often they showed me the papers of the false lawsuits brought
against them Often they wept on account of the persecution put upon
them by their mothers kin Men thought it was drugs when their eyes
showed red

They wept in my presence too said the SubadarMajor Wellconducted
men of nine years service apiece Rutton Singh was drillNaik too

They did all things correctly as Sikhs should said the Regimental
Chaplain When the persecution had endured seven years Attar Singh
took leave to Pishapur once again that was the fourth time in that year
only and he called his persecutors together before the village elders
and he cast his turban at their feet and besought them by his mothers
blood to cease from their persecutions For he told them earnestly that
he had marched to the boundaries of his patience and that there could
be but one end to the matter

They gave him abuse They mocked him and his tears which was the same
as though they had mocked the Regiment Then Attar Singh returned to the
Regiment and laid this last trouble before Rutton Singh the eldest
brother But Rutton Singh could not get leave all at once

Because he was drillNaik and the recruits were to be drilled I myself
told him so said the SubadarMajor He was a wellconducted man He
said he could wait

But when permission was granted those two took four days leave the
Chaplain went on

I do not think Attar Singh should have taken Baynes Sahibs revolver
He was Baynes Sahibs orderly and all that Sahibs things were open to
him It was therefore as I count it shame to Attar Singh said the
SubadarMajor

All the words had been said There was need of arms and how could
soldiers use Government rifles upon mere cultivators in the fields the
Regimental Chaplain replied Moreover the revolver was sent back
together with a moneyorder for the cartridges expended Borrow not
but if thou borrowest pay back soon That is written in the Hymns
Rutton Singh took a sword and he and Attar Singh went to Pishapur and
after word given the four brethren fell upon their persecutors in
Pishapur village and slew seventeen wounding ten A revolver is better
than a lawsuit I say that these four brethren the two with us and
the two mere cultivators slew and wounded twentysevenall their
mothers kin male and female

Then the four mounted to their housetop and Attar Singh who was
always one of the impetuous said My work is done and he made
shinan purification in all mens sight and he lent Rutton Singh
Baynes Sahibs revolver and Rutton Singh shot him in the head

So Attar Singh abandoned his body as an insect abandons a blade of
grass But Rutton Singh having more work to do went down from the
housetop and sought an enemy whom he had forgottena Patiala man of
this regiment who had sided with the persecutors When he overtook the
man Rutton Singh hit him twice with bullets and once with the sword

But the man escaped and is now in the hospital here said the
SubadarMajor The doctor says he will live in spite of all

Not Rutton Singhs fault Rutton Singh left him for dead Then Rutton
Singh returned to the housetop and the three brothers together Attar
Singh being dead sent word by a lad to the police station for an army
to be dispatched against them that they might die with honours But none
came And yet Patiala State is not under English law and they should
know virtue there when they see it

So on the third day Rutton Singh also made shinan and the youngest
of the brethren shot him also in the head and he abandoned his body

Thus was all correct There was neither heat nor haste nor abuse in
the matter from end to end There remained alive not one man or woman of
their mothers kin which had oppressed them Of the other villagers of
Pishapur who had taken no part in the persecutions not one was slain
Indeed the villagers sent them food on the housetop for those three
days while they waited for the police who would not dispatch that army

Listen again I know that Attar Singh and Rutton Singh omitted no
ceremony of the purifications and when all was done Baynes Sahibs
revolver was thrown down from the housetop together with three rupees
twelve annas and order was given for its return by post

And what befell the two younger brethren who were not in the service
the HavildarMajor asked

Doubtless they too are dead but since they were not in the Regiment
their honour concerns themselves only So far as we were touched see
how correctly we came out of the matter I think the King should be
told for where could you match such a tale except among us Sikhs Sri
wah guru ji ki Khalsa Sri wah guru ji ki futteh said the
Regimental Chaplain

Would three rupees twelve annas pay for the used cartridges said the
HavildarMajor

Attar Singh knew the just price All Baynes Sahibs gear was in his
charge They expended one tin box of fifty cartouches lacking two which
were returned As I saidas I saythe arrangement was made not with
heat nor blasphemies as a Mussulman would have made it not with cries
nor caperings as an idolater would have made it but conformably to the
ritual and doctrine of the Sikhs Hear you Though hundreds of
amusements are offered to a child it cannot live without milk If a man
be divorced from his soul and his souls desire he certainly will not
stop to play upon the road but he will make haste with his
pilgrimage That is written I rejoice in my disciples

True True Correct Correct said the SubadarMajor There was a
long easy silence One heard a waterwheel creaking somewhere and the
nearer sound of meal being ground in a quern

But he the Chaplain pointed a scornful chin at the
HavildarMajorhe has been so long in England that

Let the lad alone said his uncle He was but two months there and
he was chosen for good cause

Theoretically all Sikhs are equal Practically there are differences
as none know better than wellborn landowning folk or longdescended
chaplains from Amritsar

Hast thou heard anything in England to match my tale the Chaplain
sneered

I saw more than I could understand so I have locked up my stories in
my own mouth the HavildarMajor replied meekly

Stories What stories I know all the stories about England said the
Chaplain I know that terains run underneath their bazaars there and
as for their streets stinking with mota kahars only this morning I
was nearly killed by Duggan Sahibs motakahar That young man is
a devil

I expect Grunthijee said the SubadarMajor you and I grow too old
to care for the Kaharkinautchthe Bearers dance He named one of
the sauciest of the oldtime nautches and smiled at his own pun Then
he turned to his nephew When I was a lad and came back to my village
on leave I waited the convenient hour and the elders giving
permission I spoke of what I had seen elsewhere

Ay my father said the HavildarMajor softly and affectionately He
sat himself down with respect as behoved a mere lad of thirty with a
bare halfdozen campaigns to his credit

There were four men in this affair also he began and it was an
affair that touched the honour not of one regiment nor two but of all
the Army in Hind Some part of it I saw some I heard but all the
tale is true My fathers brother knows and my priest knows that I was
in England on business with my Colonel when the Kingthe Great Queens
soncompleted his life

First there was a rumour that sickness was upon him Next we knew
that he lay sick in the Palace A very great multitude stood outside the
Palace by night and by day in the rain as well as the sun waiting
for news

Then came out one with a written paper and set it upon a
gatesidethe word of the Kings deathand they read and groaned
This I saw with my own eyes because the office where my Colonel Sahib
went daily to talk with Colonel Forsyth Sahib was at the east end of the
very gardens where the Palace stood They are larger gardens than
Shalimar herehe pointed with his chin up the linesor Shahdera
across the river

Next day there was a darkness in the streets because all the citys
multitude were clad in black garments and they spoke as a man speaks in
the presence of his deadall those multitudes In the eyes in the air
and in the heart there was blackness I saw it But that is not
my tale

After ceremonies had been accomplished and word had gone out to the
Kings of the Earth that they should come and mourn the new Kingthe
dead Kings songave commandment that his fathers body should be laid
coffined in a certain Temple which is near the river There are no
idols in that Temple neither any carvings nor paintings nor gildings
It is all grey stone of one colour as though it were cut out of the
live rock It is larger thanyes than the Durbar Sahib at Amritsar
even though the Akal Bunga and the BabaAtal were added How old it may
be God knows It is the Sahibs most sacred Temple

In that place by the new Kings commandment they made as it were a
shrine for a saint with lighted candles at the head and the feet of the
Dead and duly appointed watchers for every hour of the day and the
night until the dead King should be taken to the place of his fathers
which is at Wanidza

When all was in order the new King said Give entrance to all
people and the doors were opened and O my uncle O my teacher all
the world entered walking through that Temple to take farewell of the
Dead There was neither distinction nor price nor ranking in the host
except an order that they should walk by fours

As they gathered in the streets withoutvery very far offso they
entered the Temple walking by fours the child the old man mother
virgin harlot trader priest of all colours and faiths and customs
under the firmament of God from dawn till late at night I saw it My
Colonel gave me leave to go I stood in the line many hours one
koss two koss distant from the temple

Then why did the multitude not sit down under the trees asked the
priest

Because we were still between houses The city is many koss wide
the HavildarMajor resumed I submitted myself to that slowmoving
river and thusthusa pace at a timeI made pilgrimage There were in
my rank a woman a cripple and a lascar from the ships

When we entered the Temple the coffin itself was as a shoal in the
Ravi River splitting the stream into two branches one on either side
of the Dead and the watchers of the Dead who were soldiers stood
about It moving no more than the still flame of the candles Their
heads were bowed their hands were clasped their eyes were cast upon
the groundthus They were not men but images and the multitude went
past them in fours by day and except for a little while by
night also

No there was no order that the people should come to pay respect It
was a freewill pilgrimage Eight kings had been commanded to comewho
obeyedbut upon his own Sahibs the new King laid no commandment Of
themselves they came

I made pilgrimage twice once for my Salts sake and once again for
wonder and terror and worship But my mouth cannot declare one thing of
a hundred thousand things in this matter There were lakhs of lakhs
crores of crores of people I saw them

More than at our great pilgrimages the Regimental Chaplain demanded

Yes Those are only cities and districts coming out to pray This was
the world walking in grief And now hear you It is the Kings custom
that four swords of Our Armies in Hind should stand always before the
Presence in case of need

The Kings custom our right said the SubadarMajor curtly

Also our right These honoured ones are changed after certain months or
years that the honour may be fairly spread Now it chanced that when
the old Kingthe Queens soncompleted his days the four that stood
in the Presence were Goorkhas Neither Sikhs alas nor Pathans Rajputs
nor Jats Goorkhas my father

Idolaters said the Chaplain

But soldiers for I remember in the Tirah the HavildarMajor began

But soldiers for I remember fifteen campaigns Go on said the
SubadarMajor

And it was their honour and right to furnish one who should stand in
the Presence by day and by night till It went out to burial There were
no more than four all toldfour old men to furnish that guard

Old Old What talk is this of old men said the SubadarMajor

Nay My fault Your pardon The HavildarMajor spread a deprecating
hand They were strong hot valiant men and the youngest was a lad of
fortyfive

That is better the SubadarMajor laughed

But for all their strength and heat they could not eat strange food
from the Sahibs hands There was no cooking place in the Temple but a
certain Colonel Forsyth Sahib who had understanding made arrangement
whereby they should receive at least a little casteclean parched grain
also cold rice maybe and water which was pure Yet at best this was
no more than a hens mouthful snatched as each came off his guard They
lived on grain and were thankful as the saying is

One hours guard in every four was each mans burden for as I have
shown they were but four all told and the honour of Our Armies in Hind
was on their heads The Sahibs could draw upon all the armies in England
for the other watchersthousands upon thousands of fresh menif they
needed but these four were but four

The Sahibs drew upon the Granadeers for the other watchers Granadeers
be very tall men under very tall bearskins such as Fusilier regiments
wear in cold weather Thus when a Granadeer bowed his head but a very
little over his stock the bearskin sloped and showed as though he
grieved exceedingly Now the Goorkhas wear flat green caps

I see I see said the SubadarMajor impatiently

They are bullnecked too and their stocks are hard and when they
bend deeplydeeplyto match the Granadeersthey come nigh to choking
themselves That was a handicap against them when it came to the
observance of ritual

Yet even with their tall griefdeclaring bearskins the Granadeers
could not endure the full hours guard in the Presence There was good
cause as I will show why no man could endure that terrible hour So
for them the hours guard was cut to onehalf What did it matter to the
Sahibs They could draw on ten thousand Granadeers Forsyth Sahib who
had comprehension put this choice also before the four and they said
No ours is the Honour of the Armies of Hind Whatever the Sahibs do
we will suffer the full hour

Forsyth Sahib seeing that they wereknowing that they could neither
sleep long nor eat much said Is it great suffering They said It
is great honour We will endure

Forsyth Sahib who loves us said then to the eldest Ho father tell
me truly what manner of burden it is for the full hours watch breaks
up our men like water

The eldest answered Sahib the burden is the feet of the multitude
that pass us on either side Our eyes being lowered and fixed we see
those feet only from the knee downa river of feet Sahib that
nevernevernever stops It is not the standing without any motion it
is not hunger nor is it the dead part before the dawn when maybe a
single one comes here to weep It is the burden of the unendurable
procession of feet from the knee down that nevernevernever stops

Forsyth Sahib said By God I had not considered that Now I know why
our men come trembling and twitching off that guard But at least my
father ease the stock a little beneath the bent chin for that
one hour

The eldest said We are in the Presence Moreover He knew every
button and braid and hook of every uniform in all His armies

Then Forsyth Sahib said no more except to speak about their parched
grain but indeed they could not eat much after their hour nor could
they sleep much because of eyetwitchings and the renewed procession of
the feet before the eyes Yet they endured each his full hournot half
an hourhis one full hour in each four hours

Correct correct said the SubadarMajor and the Chaplain together
We come well out of this affair

But seeing that they were old men said the SubadarMajor
reflectively very old men worn out by lack of food and sleep could
not arrangements have been made or influence have been secured or a
petition presented whereby a wellborn Sikh might have eased them of
some portion of their great burden even though his substantive rank

Then they would most certainly have slain me said the HavildarMajor
with a smile

And they would have done correctly said the Chaplain What befell
the honourable ones later

This The Kings of the earth and all the Armies sent flowers and
suchlike to the dead Kings palace at Wanidza where the funeral
offerings were accepted There was no order given but all the world
made oblation So the four took counselthree at a timeand either
they asked Forsyth Sahib to choose flowers or themselves they went
forth and bought flowersI do not know but however it was arranged
the flowers were bought and made in the shape of a great drumlike
circle weighing half a maund

Forsyth Sahib had said Let the flowers be sent to Wanidza with the
other flowers which all the world is sending But they said among
themselves It is not fit that these flowers which are the offerings
of His Armies in Hind should come to the Palace of the Presence by the
hands of hirelings or messengers or of any man not in His service

Hearing this Forsyth Sahib though he was much occupied with
officework said Give me the flowers and I will steal a time and
myself take them to Wanidza

The eldest said Since when has Forsyth Sahib worn sword

Forsyth Sahib said But always And I wear it in the Presence when I
put on uniform I am a Colonel in the Armies of Hind The eldest said
Of what regiment And Forsyth Sahib looked on the carpet and pulled
the hair of his lip He saw the trap

Forsyth Sahibs regiment was once the old Fortysixth Pathans which
was called the SubadarMajor gave the almost forgotten title adding
that he had met them in such and such campaigns when Forsyth Sahib was
a young captain

The HavildarMajor took up the tale saying The eldest knew that also
my father He laughed and presently Forsyth Sahib laughed

It is true said Forsyth Sahib I have no regiment For twenty years
I have been a clerk tied to a thick pen Therefore I am the more fit to
be your orderly and messenger in this business

The eldest then said If it were a matter of my life or the honour of
any of my household it would be easy And Forsyth Sahib joined his
hands together half laughing though he was ready to weep and he said
Enough I ask pardon Which one of you goes with the offering

The eldest said feigning not to have heard Nor must they be
delivered by a single swordas though we were pressed for men in His
service and they saluted and went out

Were these things seen or were they told thee said the
SubadarMajor

I both saw and heard in the office full of books and papers where my
Colonel Sahib consulted Forsyth Sahib upon the business that had brought
my Colonel Sahib to England

And what was that business the Regimental Chaplain asked of a sudden
looking full at the HavildarMajor who returned the look without
a quiver

That was not revealed to me said the HavildarMajor

I heard it might have been some matter touching the integrity of
certain regiments the Chaplain insisted

The matter was not in any way open to my ears said the
HavildarMajor

Humph The Chaplain drew his hard roadworn feet under his robe Let
us hear the tale that it is permitted thee to tell he said and the
HavildarMajor went on

So then the three having returned to the Temple called the fourth
who had only fortyfive years when he came off guard and said We go
to the Palace at Wanidza with the offerings Remain thou in the
Presence and take all our guards one after the other till we return

Within that next hour they hired a large and strong motakahar for
the journey from the Temple to Wanidza which is twenty koss or more
and they promised expedition But he who took their guards said It is
not seemly that we should for any cause appear to be in haste There are
eighteen medals with eleven clasps and three Orders to consider Go at
leisure I can endure

So the three with the offerings were absent three hours and a half and
having delivered the offering at Wanidza in the correct manner they
returned and found the lad on guard and they did not break his guard
till his full hour was ended So he endured four hours in the
Presence not stirring one hair his eyes abased and the river of
feet from the knee down passing continually before his eyes When he
was relieved it was seen that his eyeballs worked like
weavers shuttles

And so it was donenot in hot blood not for a little while nor yet
with the smell of slaughter and the noise of shouting to sustain but in
silence for a very long time rooted to one place before the Presence
among the most terrible feet of the multitude

Correct the Chaplain chuckled

But the Goorkhas had the honour said the SubadarMajor sadly

Theirs was the Honour of His Armies in Hind and that was Our Honour
the nephew replied

Yet I would one Sikh had been concerned in iteven one lowcaste Sikh
And after

They endured the burden until the enduntil It went out of the Temple
to be laid among the older kings at Wanidza When all was accomplished
and It was withdrawn under the earth Forsyth Sahib said to the four
The King gives command that you be fed here on meat cooked by your own
cooks Eat and take ease my fathers

So they loosed their belts and ate They had not eaten food except by
snatches for some long time and when the meat had given them strength
they slept for very many hours and it was told me that the procession
of the unendurable feet ceased to pass before their eyes any more

He threw out one hand palm upward to show that the tale was ended

We came well and cleanly out of it said the SubadarMajor

Correct Correct Correct said the Regimental Chaplain In an evil
age it is good to hear such things and there is certainly no doubt that
this is a very evil age




JOBSONS AMEN

     Blessed be the English and all their ways and works
     Cursed be the Infidels Hereticks and Turks
     Amen quo Jobson but where I used to lie
     Was neither Candle Bell nor Book to curse my brethren by

     But a palmtree in full bearing bowing down bowing down
     To a surf that drove unsparing at the brownwalled town
     Conches in a temple oillamps in a dome
     And a low moon out of Africa said This way home

     Blessed be the English and all that they profess
     Cursed be the Savages that prance in nakedness
     Amen quo Jobson but where I used to lie
     Was neither shirt nor pantaloons to catch my brethren by

     But a wellwheel slowly creaking going round going round
     By a waterchannel leaking over drowned warm ground
     Parrots very busy in the trellised peppervine
     And a high sun over Asia shouting Rise and shine

     Blessed be the English and everything they own
     Cursed be the Infidels that bow to wood and stone
     Amen quo Jobson but where I used to lie
     Was neither pew nor Gospelleer to save my brethren by

REGULUS



Regulus a Roman general defeated the Carthaginians  BC but was
next year defeated and taken prisoner by the Carthaginians who sent him
to Rome with an embassy to ask for peace or an exchange of prisoners
Regulus strongly advised the Roman Senate to make no terms with the
enemy He then returned to Carthage and was put to death

The Fifth Form had been dragged several times in its collective life
from one end of the school Horace to the other Those were the years
when Army examiners gave thousands of marks for Latin and it was Mr
Kings hated business to defeat them

Hear him then on a raw November morning at second lesson

Aha he began rubbing his hands Cras ingens iterabimus aequor
Our portion today is the Fifth Ode of the Third Book I
believeconcerning one Regulus a gentleman And how often have we been
through it

Twice sir said Malpass head of the Form

Mr King shuddered Yes twice quite literally he said Today
with an eye to your Army vivavoce examinationsughI shall exact
somewhat freer and more florid renditions With feeling and
comprehension if that be possible I excepthere his eye swept the
back benchesour friend and companion Beetle from whom now as
always I demand an absolutely literal translation The form laughed
subserviently

Spare his blushes Beetle charms us first

Beetle stood up confident in the possession of a guaranteed construe
left behind by MTurk who had that day gone into the sickhouse with a
cold Yet he was too wary a hand to show confidence

Credidimus webelievewe have believed he opened in
hesitating slow time tonantem Joven thundering Joveregnare
to reigncaelo in heaven Augustus Augustushabebitur

Godadjectis Britannis the Britons being addedimperio to the
Empiregravibusque Persis with the heavyer stern Persians

What

The grave or stern Persians Beetle pulled up with the
ThankGodIhavedonemyduty air of Nelson in the cockpit

I am quite aware said King that the first stanza is about the
extent of your knowledge but continue sweet one continue Gravibus
by the way is usually translated as troublesome

Beetle drew a long and tortured breath The second stanza which carries
over to the third of that Ode is what is technically called a
stinker But MTurk had done him handsomely

Milesne Crassi hadhas the soldier of Crassusvixit
livedturpis maritus a disgraceful husband

You slurred the quantity of the word after turpis said King Lets
hear it

Beetle guessed again and for a wonder hit the correct quantity Era
disgraceful husbandconjuge barbara with a barbarous spouse

Why do you select that disgustful equivalent out of all the
dictionary King snapped Isnt wife good enough for you

Yes sir But what do I do about this bracket sir Shall I take it
now

Confine yourself at present to the soldier of Crassus

Yes sir Et andconsenuit has he grown oldin armis in
theerarmshositum socerorum of his fatherinlaws enemies

Who How Which

Arms of his enemies fathersinlaw sir

Thaanks By the way what meaning might you attach to in armis

Oh weaponsweapons of war sir There was a virginal note in
Beetles voice as though he had been falsely accused of uttering
indecencies Shall I take the bracket now sir

Since it seems to be troubling you

Pro Curia O for the Senate Houseinversique mores and manners
upsetupside down

Very like your translation Meantime the soldier of Crassus

Marsian and an Apulian

Who The Median King

No sir The soldier of Crassus Oblittus agrees with milesne

Ohblightus Beetle corrected hastily forgetfulanciliorum of

Jove being safeet urbe Roma and the Roman city With an air of
hardly restrained zealShall I go on sir

Mr King winced No thank you You have indeed given us a translation
May I ask if it conveys any meaning whatever to your socalled mind

Oh I think so sir This with gentle toleration for Horace and all
his works

We envy you Sit down

Beetle sat down relieved well knowing that a reef of uncharted
genitives stretched ahead of him on which in spite of MTurks
sailingdirections he would infallibly have been wrecked

Rattray who took up the task steered neatly through them and came
unscathed to port

Here we require drama said King Regulus himself is speaking now
Who shall represent the providentminded Regulus Winton will you
kindly oblige

Winton of Kings House a long heavy towheaded Second Fifteen
forward overdue for his First Fifteen colours and in aspect like an
earnest elderly horse rose up and announced among other things
that he had seen signs affixed to Punic deluges Half the Form shouted
for joy and the other half for joy that there was something to
shout about

Mr King opened and shut his eyes with great swiftness Signa adfixa
delubris he gasped So delubris is deluges is it Winton in all
our dealings have I ever suspected you of a jest

No sir said the rigid and angular Winton while the Form rocked
about him

And yet you assert delubris means deluges Whether I am a fit
subject for such a jape is of course a matter of opinion but
Winton you are normally conscientious May we assume you looked out
delubris

No sir Winton was privileged to speak that truth dangerous to all
who stand before Kings

Made a shot at it then

Every line of Wintons body showed he had done nothing of the sort
Indeed the very idea that Pater Winton and a boy is not called
Pater by companions for his frivolity would make a shot at anything
was beyond belief But he replied Yes and all the while worked with
his right heel as though he were heeling a ball at puntabout

Though none dared to boast of being a favourite with King the taciturn
threecornered Winton stood high in his HouseMasters opinion It
seemed to save him neither rebuke nor punishment but the two were in
some fashion sympathetic

Hm said King drily I was going to sayFlagito additis damnum
but I thinkI think I see the process Beetle the translation of
delubris please

Beetle raised his head from his shaking arm long enough to answer
Ruins sir

There was an impressive pause while King checked off crimes on his
fingers Then to Beetle the muchenduring man addressed winged words

Guessing said he Guessing Beetle as usual from the look of
delubris that it bore some relation to diluvium or deluge you
imparted the result of your halfbaked lucubrations to Winton who seems
to have been lost enough to have accepted it Observing next your
companions fall from the presumed security of your undistinguished
position in the rearguard you took another potshot The turbid chaos
of your mind threw up some memory of the word dilapidations which you
have pitifully attempted to disguise under the synonym of ruins

As this was precisely what Beetle had done he looked hurt but forgiving
We will attend to this later said King Go on Winton and retrieve
yourself

Delubris happened to be the one word which Winton had not looked out
and had asked Beetle for when they were settling into their places He
forged ahead with no further trouble Only when he rendered scilicet
as forsooth King erupted

Regulus he said was not a leaderwriter for the penny press nor
for that matter was Horace Regulus says The soldier ransomed by gold
will come keener for the fightwill he byby gum Thats the
meaning of scilicet It indicates contemptbitter contempt
Forsooth forsooth Youll be talking about speckled beauties and
eventually transpire next Howell what do you make of that doubled
Vidi egoego vidi It wasnt put in to fill up the metre you know

Isnt it intensive sir said Howell afflicted by a genuine interest
in what he read Regulus was a bit in earnest about Rome making no
terms with Carthageand he wanted to let the Romans understand it
didnt he sir

Less than your usual grace but the fact Regulus was in earnest He
was also engaged at the same time in cutting his own throat with every
word he uttered He knew Carthage which your examiners wont ask you
this so you neednt take notes was a sort of Godforsaken nigger
Manchester Regulus was not thinking about his own life He was telling
Rome the truth He was playing for his side Those lines from the
eighteenth to the fortieth ought to be written in blood Yet there are
things in human garments which will tell you that Horace was a
flneura man about town Avoid such beings Horace knew a very great
deal He knew Erit ille fortiswill he be brave who once to
faithless foes has knelt And again stop pawing with your hooves
Thornton hic unde vitam sumeret inscius That means roughlybut I
perceive I am ahead of my translators Begin at hic unde Vernon and
let us see if you have the spirit of Regulus

Now no one expected fireworks from gentle Paddy Vernon subprefect of
Hartopps House but as must often be the case with growing boys his
mind was in abeyance for the time being and he said all in a rush on
behalf of Regulus O magna Carthago probrosis altior Italiae ruinis
O Carthage thou wilt stand forth higher than the ruins of Italy

Even Beetle most lenient of critics was interested at this point
though he did not join the halfgroan of reprobation from the wiser
heads of the Form

Please dont mind me said King and Vernon very kindly did not He
ploughed on thus He Regulus is related to have removed from himself
the kiss of the shameful wife and of his small children as less by the
head and being stern to have placed his virile visage on the ground

Since King loved virile about as much as he did spouse or forsooth
the Form looked up hopefully But Jove thundered not

Until Vernon continued he should have confirmed the sliding fathers
as being the author of counsel never given under an alias

He stopped conscious of stillness round him like the dread calm of the
typhoons centre Kings opening voice was sweeter than honey

I am painfully aware by bitter experience that I cannot give you any
idea of the passion the power thethe essential guts of the lines
which you have so foully outraged in our presence But the note
changed so far as in me lies I will strive to bring home to you
Vernon the fact that there exist in Latin a few pitiful rules of
grammar of syntax nay even of declension which were not created for
your incult sportyour Boeotian diversion You will therefore Vernon
write out and bring to me tomorrow a wordforword EnglishLatin
translation of the Ode together with a full list of all adjectivesan
adjective is not a verb Vernon as the Lower Third will tell youall
adjectives their number case and gender Even now I havent begun to
deal with you faithfully

IIm very sorry sir Vernon stammered

You mistake the symptoms Vernon You are possibly discomfited by the
imposition but sorrow postulates some sort of mind intellect nous
Your rendering of probrosis alone stamps you as lower than the beasts
of the field Will some one take the taste out of our mouths
Andtalking of tastes He coughed There was a distinct flavour of
chlorine gas in the air Up went an eyebrow though King knew perfectly
well what it meant

Mr Hartopps stscience class next door said Malpass

Oh yes I had forgotten Our newly established Modern Side of course
Perowne open the windows and Winton go on once more from interque
maerentes

And hastened away said Winton surrounded by his mourning friends
intointo illustrious banishment But I got that out of Conington
sir he added in one conscientious breath

I am aware The master generally knows his asss crib though I acquit
you of any intention that way Can you suggest anything for egregius
exul Only egregious exile I fear egregious is a good word ruined
No You cant in this case improve on Conington Now then for atqui
sciebat quae sibi barbarus tortor pararet The whole force of it lies
in the atqui

Although he knew Winton suggested

Stronger than that I think

He who knew well Malpass interpolated

Yees Well though he knew I dont like Coningtons wellwitting
Its Wardour Street

Well though he knew what the savage torturer waswas getting ready for
him said Winton

Yees Had in store for him

Yet he brushed aside his kinsmen and the people delaying his return

Yees but then how do you render obstantes

If its a free translation mightnt obstantes and morantem come to
about the same thing sir

Nothing comes to about the same thing with Horace Winton As I have
said Horace was not a journalist No I take it that his kinsmen bodily
withstood his departure whereas the crowdpopulumquethe democracy
stood about futilely pitying him and getting in the way Now for that
noblest of endingsquam si clientum and King ran off into the
quotation

     As though some tedious business oer
     Of clients court his journey lay
     Towards Venafrums grassy floor
     Or Spartabuilt Tarentums bay

All right Winton Beetle when youve quite finished dodging the fresh
air yonder give me the meaning of tendensand turn down
your collar

Me sir Tendens sir Oh Stretching away in the direction of sir

Idiot Regulus was not a feature of the landscape He was a man
selfdoomed to death by torture Atqui sciebatknowing ithaving
achieved it for his countrys sakecant you hear that atqui cut like
a knifehe moved off with some dignity That is why Horace out of the
whole golden Latin tongue chose the one word tendenswhich is utterly
untranslatable

The gross injustice of being asked to translate it converted Beetle
into a young Christian martyr till King buried his nose in his
handkerchief again

I think theyve broken another gasbottle next door sir said Howell
Theyre always doing it The Form coughed as more chlorine came in

Well I suppose we must be patient with the Modern Side said King
But it is almost insupportable for this Side Vernon what are you
grinning at

Vernons mind had returned to him glowing and inspired He chuckled as
he underlined his Horace

It appears to amuse you said King Let us participate What is it

The last two lines of the Tenth Ode in this book sir was Vernons
amazing reply

What Oh I see Non hoc semper erit liminis aut aquae caelestis
patiens latus Kings mouth twitched to hide a grin Was that
done with intention

Footnote  This side will not always be patient of rain and waiting
on the threshold

II thought it fitted sir

It does Its distinctly happy What put it into your thick head
Paddy

I dont know sir except we did the Ode last term

And you remembered The same head that minted probrosis as a verb
Vernon you are an enigma No This Side will not always be patient of
unheavenly gases and waters I will make representations to our
socalled Moderns Meantime who shall say I am not just I remit you
your accrued pains and penalties in regard to probrosim probrosis
probrosit and other enormities I oughtnt to do it but this Side is
occasionally human By no means bad Paddy

Thank you sir said Vernon wondering how inspiration had visited
him

Then King with a few brisk remarks about Science headed them back to
Regulus of whom and of Horace and Rome and evilminded commercial
Carthage and of the democracy eternally futile he explained in all
ages and climes he spoke for ten minutes passing thence to the next
OdeDelicta Majorumwhere he fetched up fullvoiced uponDis te
minorem quod geris imperas Thou rulest because thou bearest thyself
as lower than the Godsmaking it a text for a discourse on manners
morals and respect for authority as distinct from bottled gases which
lasted till the bell rang Then Beetle concertinaing his books
observed to Winton When Kings really on tap hes an interestin dog
Hartopps chlorine uncorked him

Yes but why did you tell me delubris was deluges you silly ass
said Winton

Well that uncorked him too Look out you hoofhanded old owl Winton
had cleared for action as the Form poured out like puppies at play and
was scragging Beetle Stalky from behind collared Winton low The three
fell in confusion

Dis te minorem quod geris imperas quoth Stalky ruffling Wintons
lintwhite locks Mustnt jape with Number Five study Dont be too
virtuous Dont brood over it Twont count against you in your future
careeah Cheer up Pater

Pull him off myeressential guts will you said Beetle from
beneath Hes squashin em

They dispersed to their studies

                                   

No one the owner least of all can explain what is in a growing boys
mind It might have been the blind ferment of adolescence Stalkys
random remarks about virtue might have stirred him like his betters he
might have sought popularity by way of clowning or as the Head
asserted years later the only known jest of his serious life might have
worked on him as a sobersided mans one love colours and dislocates
all his after days But at the next lesson mechanical drawing with Mr
Lidgett who as drawingmaster had very limited powers of punishment
Winton fell suddenly from grace and let loose a live mouse in the
formroom The whole form shrieking and leaping high threw at it all
the plaster cones pyramids and fruit in high reliefnot to mention
inkpotsthat they could lay hands on Mr Lidgett reported at once to
the Head Winton owned up to his crime which venial in the Upper
Third pardonable at a price in the Lower Fourth was of course rank
ruffianism on the part of a Fifth Form boy and so by graduated stages
he arrived at the Heads study just before lunch penitent perturbed
annoyed with himself andas the Head said to King in the corridor after
the mealmore human than he had known him in seven years

You see the Head drawled on Wintons only fault is a certain
costive and unaccommodating virtue So this comes very happily

Ive never noticed any sign of it said King Winton was in Kings
House and though King as proconsul might and did infernally oppress
his own Province once a black and yellow cap was in trouble at the
hands of the Imperial authority King fought for him to the very last
steps of Caesars throne

Well you yourself admitted just now that a mouse was beneath the
occasion the Head answered

It was Mr King did not love Mr Lidgett It should have been a rat
ButbutI hate to plead itits the lads first offence

Could you have damned him more completely King

Hm What is the penalty said King in retreat but keeping up a
rearguard action

Only my usual few lines of Virgil to be shown up by teatime

The Heads eyes turned slightly to that end of the corridor where
Mullins Captain of the Games Pot old Pot or Potiphar Mullins
was pinning up the usual Wednesday noticeBig Middle and Little Side
FootballA to K L to Z  to  PM

You cannot write out the Heads usual few which means five hundred
Latin lines and play football for one hour and threequarters between
the hours of  and  PM Winton had evidently no intention of trying
to do so for he hung about the corridor with a set face and an uneasy
foot Yet it was law in the school compared with which that of the
Medes and Persians was no more than a noncommittal resolution that any
boy outside the First Fifteen who missed his football for any reason
whatever and had not a written excuse duly signed by competent
authority to explain his absence would receive not less than three
strokes with a groundash from the Captain of the Games generally a
youth between seventeen and eighteen years rarely under eleven stone
Pot was nearer thirteen and always in hard condition

King knew without inquiry that the Head had given Winton no such excuse

But he is practically a member of the First Fifteen He has played for
it all this term said King I believe his Cap should have arrived
last week

His Cap has not been given him Officially therefore he is naught I
rely on old Pot

But Mullins is Wintons studymate King persisted

Pot Mullins and Pater Winton were cousins and rather close friends

That will make no difference to Mullinsor Winton if I know em
said the Head

Butbut King played his last card desperately I was going to
recommend Winton for extra subprefect in my House now Carton
has gone

Certainly said the Head Why not He will be excellent by teatime
I hope

At that moment they saw Mr Lidgett tripping down the corridor waylaid
by Winton

Its about that mousebusiness at mechanical drawing Winton opened
swinging across his path

Yes yes highly disgraceful Mr Lidgett panted

I know it was said Winton Itit was a cads trick because

Because you knew I couldnt give you more than fifty lines said Mr
Lidgett

Well anyhow Ive come to apologise for it

Certainly said Mr Lidgett and added for he was a kindly man I
think that shows quite right feeling Ill tell the Head at once Im
satisfied

Nono The boys still unmended voice jumped from the growl to the
squeak I didnt mean that II did it on principle Please
donterdo anything of that kind

Mr Lidgett looked him up and down and being an artist understood

Thank you Winton he said This shall be between ourselves

You heard said King indecent pride in his voice

Of course You thought he was going to get Lidgett to beg him off the
impot

King denied this with so much warmth that the Head laughed and King went
away in a huff

By the way said the Head Ive told Winton to do his lines in your
formroomnot in his study

Thanks said King over his shoulder for the Heads orders had saved
Winton and Mullins who was doing extra Army work in the study from an
embarrassing afternoon together

An hour later King wandered into his still formroom as though by
accident Winton was hard at work

Aha said King rubbing his hands This does not look like games
Winton Dont let me arrest your facile pen Whence this sudden love
for Virgil

Impot from the Head sir for that mousebusiness this morning

Rumours thereof have reached us That was a lapse on your part into
Lower Thirdery which I dont quite understand

The tumptump of the puntabouts before the sides settled to games came
through the open window Winton like his HouseMaster loved fresh air
Then they heard Paddy Vernon subprefect on duty calling the roll in
the field and marking defaulters Winton wrote steadily King curled
himself up on a desk hands round knees One would have said that the
man was gloating over the boys misfortune but the boy understood

Dis te minorem quod geris imperas King quoted presently It is
necessary to bear oneself as lower than the local godseven than
drawingmasters who are precluded from effective retaliation I do
wish youd tried that mousegame with me Pater

Winton grinned then sobered It was a cads trick sir to play on Mr
Lidgett He peered forward at the page he was copying

Well the sin I impute to each frustrate ghost King stopped
himself Why do you goggle like an owl Hand me the Mantuan and Ill
dictate No matter Any rich Virgilian measures will serve I may
peradventure recall a few He began

     Tu regere imperio populos Romane memento
     Hae tibi erunt artes pacisque imponere morem
     Parcere subjectis et debellare superbos

There you have it all Winton Write that out twice and yet once again

For the next forty minutes with never a glance at the book King paid
out the glorious hexameters and King could read Latin as though it were
alive Winton hauling them in and coiling them away behind him as
trimmers in a telegraphships hold coil away deepsea cable King broke
from the Aeneid to the Georgics and back again pausing now and then to
translate some specially loved line or to dwell on the trebleshot
texture of the ancient fabric He did not allude to the coming interview
with Mullins except at the last when he said I think at this
juncture Pater I need not ask you for the precise significance of
atqui sciebat quae sibi barbarus tortor

The ungrateful Winton flushed angrily and King loafed out to take five
oclock callover after which he invited little Hartopp to tea and a
talk on chlorinegas Hartopp accepted the challenge like a bantam and
the two went up to Kings study about the same time as Winton returned
to the formroom beneath it to finish his lines

Then half a dozen of the Second Fifteen who should have been washing
strolled in to condole with Pater Winton whose misfortune and its
consequences were common talk No one was more sincere than the long
redheaded knottyknuckled Paddy Vernon but being a careless
animal he joggled Wintons desk

Curse you for a silly ass said Winton Dont do that

No one is expected to be polite while under punishment so Vernon
sinking his subprefectship replied peacefully enough

Well dont be wrathy Pater

Im not said Winton Get out This aint your House formroom

Formroom dont belong to you Why dont you go to your own study
Vernon replied

Because Mullins is there waitin for the victim said Stalky
delicately and they all laughed You ought to have shaken that mouse
out of your trouserleg Pater Thats the way I did in my youth
Paters revertin to his second childhood Never mind Pater we all
respect you and your future careeah

Winton still writhing growled Vernon leaning on the desk somehow
shook it again Then he laughed

What are you grinning at Winton asked

I was only thinkin of you being sent up to take a lickin from Pot
I swear I dont think its fair Youve never shirked a game in your
life and youre as good as in the First Fifteen already Your Cap ought
to have been delivered last week oughtnt it

It was law in the school that no man could by any means enjoy the
privileges and immunities of the First Fifteen till the black velvet cap
with the gold tassel made by dilatory Exeter outfitters had been
actually set on his head Ages ago a largebuilt and unruly Second
Fifteen had attempted to change this law but the prefects of that age
were still larger and the lively experiment had never been repeated

Will you said Winton very slowly kindly mind your own damned
business you cursed clumsy fatheaded fool

The formroom was as silent as the empty field in the darkness outside
Vernon shifted his feet uneasily

Well I shouldnt like to take a lickin from Pot he said

Wouldnt you Winton asked as he paged the sheets of lines with hands
that shook

No I shouldnt said Vernon his freckles growing more distinct on
the bridge of his white nose

Well Im going to take itWinton moved clear of the desk as he
spoke But youre going to take a lickin from me first Before any
one realised it he had flung himself neighing against Vernon No
decencies were observed on either side and the rest looked on amazed
The two met confusedly Vernon trying to do what he could with his
longer reach Winton insensible to blows only concerned to drive his
enemy into a corner and batter him to pulp This he managed over against
the fireplace where Vernon dropped halfstunned Now Im going to
give you your lickin said Winton Lie there till I get a groundash
and Ill cut you to pieces If you move Ill chuck you out of the
window He wound his hands into the boys collar and waistband and had
actually heaved him half off the ground before the others with one
accord dropped on his head shoulders and legs He fought them crazily
in an awful hissing silence Stalkys sensitive nose was rubbed along
the floor Beetle received a jolt in the wind that sent him whistling
and crowing against the wall Perownes forehead was cut and Malpass
came out with an eye that explained itself like a dying rainbow through
a whole week

Mad Quite mad said Stalky and for the third time wriggled back to
Wintons throat The door opened and King came in Hartopps little
figure just behind him The mound on the floor panted and heaved but did
not rise for Winton still squirmed vengefully Only a little play
sir said Perowne Only hit my head against a form This was
quite true

Oh said King Dimovit obstantes propinquos You I presume are
the populus delaying Wintons return toMullins eh

No sir said Stalky behind his claretcoloured handkerchief Were
the maerentes amicos

Not bad You see some of it sticks after all King chuckled to
Hartopp and the two masters left without further inquiries

The boys sat still on the nowpassive Winton

Well said Stalky at last of all the putrid heasses Pater you are
the

Im sorry Im awfully sorry Winton began and they let him rise He
held out his hand to the bruised and bewildered Vernon Sorry Paddy
II must have lost my temper II dont know whats the matter
with me

Fat lot of good thatll do my face at tea Vernon grunted Why
couldnt you say there was something wrong with you instead of lamming
out like a lunatic Is my lip puffy

Just a trifle Look at my beak Well we got all these pretty marks at
footerowin to the zeal with which we played the game said Stalky
dusting himself But dyou think youre fit to be let loose again
Pater Sure you dont want to kill another subprefect I wish I was
Pot Id cut your sprightly young soul out

I spose I ought to go to Pot now said Winton

And let all the other asses see you lookin like this Not much Well
all come up to Number Five Study and wash off in hot water Beetle you
arent damaged Go along and light the gasstove

Theres a tin of cocoa in my study somewhere Perowne shouted after
him Rootle round till you find it and take it up

Separately by different roads Vernons jersey pulled half over his
head the boys repaired to Number Five Study Little Hartopp and King I
am sorry to say leaned over the banisters of Kings landing
and watched

Very human said little Hartopp Your virtuous Winton having got
himself into trouble takes it out of my poor old Paddy I wonder what
precise lie Paddy will tell about his face

But surely you arent going to embarrass him by asking said King

Your boy won said Hartopp

To go back to what we were discussing said King quickly do you
pretend that your modern system of inculcating unrelated facts about
chlorine for instance all of which may be proved fallacies by the time
the boys grow up can have any real bearing on educationeven the low
type of it that examiners expect

I maintain nothing But is it any worse than your Chinese reiteration
of uncomprehended syllables in a dead tongue

Dead forsooth King fairly danced The only living tongue on earth
Chinese On my word Hartopp

And at the end of seven yearshow often have I said it Hartopp went
onseven years of two hundred and twenty days of six hours each your
victims go away with nothing absolutely nothing except perhaps if
theyve been very attentive a dozenno Ill grant you twentyone
score of totally unrelated Latin tags which any child of twelve could
have absorbed in two terms

Butbut cant you realise that if our system brings laterat any
rateat a pincha simple understandinggrammar and Latinity aparta
mere glimpse of the significance foul word of well say one Ode of
Horace one twenty lines of Virgil weve got what we poor devils of
ushers are striving after

And what might that be said Hartopp

Balance proportion perspectivelife Your scientific man is the
unrelated animalthe beast without background Havent you ever
realised that in your atmosphere of stinks

Meantime you make them lose life for the sake of living eh

Blind again Hartopp I told you about Paddys quotation this morning
But he made probrosis a verb he did You yourself heard young
Corkrans reference to maerentes amicos It sticksa little of it
sticks among the barbarians

Absolutely and essentially Chinese said little Hartopp who alone of
the commonroom refused to be outfaced by King But I dont yet
understand how Paddy came to be licked by Winton Paddys supposed to be
something of a boxer

Beware of vinegar made from honey King replied Pater like some
other people is patient and longsuffering but he has his limits The
Head is oppressing him damnably too As I pointed out the boy has
practically been in the First Fifteen since term began

But my dear fellow Ive known you give a boy an impot and refuse him
leave off games again and again

Ah but that was when there was real need to get at some oaf who
couldnt be sensitised in any other way Now in our esteemed Heads
action I see nothing but

The conversation from this point does not concern us

Meantime Winton very penitent and especially polite towards Vernon was
being cheered with cocoa in Number Five Study They had some difficulty
in stemming the flood of his apologies He himself pointed out to Vernon
that he had attacked a subprefect for no reason whatever and
therefore deserved official punishment

I cant think what was the matter with me today he mourned Ever
since that blasted mousebusiness

Well then dont think said Stalky Or do you want Paddy to make a
row about it before all the school

Here Vernon was understood to say that he would see Winton and all the
school somewhere else

And if you imagine Perowne and Malpass and me are goin to give
evidence at a prefects meeting just to soothe your beastly conscience
you jolly well err said Beetle I know what you did

What croaked Pater out of the valley of his humiliation

You went Berserk Ive read all about it in Hypatia

Whats going Berserk Winton asked

Never you mind was the reply Now dont you feel awfully weak and
seedy

I am rather tired said Winton sighing

Thats what you ought to be Youve gone Berserk and pretty soon youll
go to sleep But youll probably be liable to fits of it all your life
Beetle concluded Shouldnt wonder if you murdered some one some day

Shut upyou and your Berserks said Stalky Go to Mullins now and
get it over Pater

I call it filthy unjust of the Head said Vernon Anyhow youve
given me my lickin old man I hope Potll give you yours

Im awfully sorryawfully sorry was Wintons last word

It was the custom in that consulship to deal with games defaulters
between five oclock callover and tea Mullins who was old enough to
pity did not believe in letting boys wait through the night till the
chill of the next morning for their punishments He was finishing off
the last of the small fry and their excuses when Winton arrived

But please Mullinsthis was Babcock tertius a dear little
twelveyearold mothers darlingI had an awful hack on the knee Ive
been to the Matron about it and she gave me some iodine Ive been
rubbing it in all day I thought that would be an excuse off

Lets have a look at it said the impassive Mullins Thats a
shinbruiseabout a week old Touch your toes Ill give you
the iodine

Babcock yelled loudly as he had many times before The face of Jevons
aged eleven a new boy that dark wet term low in the House low in the
Lower School and lowest of all in his homesick little mind turned
white at the horror of the sight They could hear his working lips part
stickily as Babcock wailed his way out of hearing

Hullo Jevons What brings you here said Mullins

Please sir I went for a walk with Babcock tertius

Did you Then I bet you went to the tuckshopand you paid didnt
you

A nod Jevons was too terrified to speak

Of course and I bet Babcock told you that old Pot ud let you off
because it was the first time

Another nod with a ghost of a smile in it

All right Mullins picked Jevons up before he could guess what was
coming laid him on the table with one hand with the other gave him
three emphatic spanks then held him high in air

Now you tell Babcock tertius that hes got you a licking from me and
see you jolly well pay it back to him And when youre prefect of games
dont you let any one shirk his footer without a written excuse Where
dyou play in your game

Forward sir

You can do better than that Ive seen you run like a young
buckrabbit Ask Dickson from me to try you as threequarter next game
will you Cut along

Jevons left warm for the first time that day enormously set up in his
own esteem and very hot against the deceitful Babcock

Mullins turned to Winton Your names on the list Pater Winton
nodded

I know it The Head landed me with an impot for that mousebusiness at
mechanical drawing No excuse

He meant it then Mullins jerked his head delicately towards the
groundash on the table I heard something about it

Winton nodded A rotten thing to do he said Cant think what I was
doing ever to do it It counts against a fellow so and theres some
more too

All right Pater Just stand clear of our photobracket will you

The little formality over there was a pause Winton swung round yawned
in Pots astonished face and staggered towards the windowseat

Whats the matter with you Dick Ill

No Perfectly all right thanks Onlyonly a little sleepy Winton
stretched himself out and then and there fell deeply and
placidly asleep

It isnt a faint said the experienced Mullins or his pulse wouldnt
act Tisnt a fit or hed snort and twitch It cant be sunstroke this
term and he hasnt been overtraining for anything He opened Wintons
collar packed a cushion under his head threw a rug over him and sat
down to listen to the regular breathing Before long Stalky arrived on
pretence of borrowing a book He looked at the windowseat

Noticed anything wrong with Winton lately said Mullins

Notice anything wrong with my beak Stalky replied Pater went
Berserk after callover and fell on a lot of us for jesting with him
about his impot You ought to see Malpasss eye

You mean that Pater fought said Mullins

Like a devil Then he nearly went to sleep in our study just now I
expect hell be all right when he wakes up Rummy business
Conscientious old bargee You ought to have heard his apologies

But Pater cant fight one little bit Mullins repeated

Twasnt fighting He just tried to murder every one Stalky described
the affair and when he left Mullins went off to take counsel with the
Head who out of a cloud of blue smoke told him that all would yet
be well

Winton said he is a little stiff in his moral joints Hell get
over that If he asks you whether todays doings will count against
him in his

But you know its important to him sir His people arentvery well
off said Mullins

Thats why Im taking all this trouble You must reassure him Pot I
have overcrowded him with new experiences Oh by the way has his
Cap come

It came at dinner sir Mullins laughed

Sure enough when he waked at teatime Winton proposed to take Mullins
all through every one of his days lapses from grace and Do you think
it will count against me said he

Dont you fuss so much about yourself and your silly career said
Mullins Youre all right And ohheres your First Cap at last Shove
it up on the bracket and come on to tea

They met King on their way stepping statelily and rubbing his hands I
have applied said he for the services of an additional subprefect
in Cartons unlamented absence Your name Winton seems to have found
favour with the powers that be andand all things consideredI am
disposed to give my support to the nomination You are therefore a
quasilictor

Then it didnt count against me Winton gasped as soon as they were
out of hearing

A Captain of Games can jest with a subprefect publicly

You utter ass said Mullins and caught him by the back of his stiff
neck and ran him down to the hall where the subprefects who sit below
the salt made him welcome with the economical bloaterpaste
of midterm

King and little Hartopp were sparring in the Reverend John Gilletts
study at  PMclassical versus modern as usual

Characterproportionbackground snarled King That is the essence
of the Humanities

Analects of Confucius little Hartopp answered

Time said the Reverend John behind the sodawater You men oppress
me Hartopp what did you say to Paddy in your dormitories tonight
Even you couldnt have overlooked his face

But I did said Hartopp calmly I wasnt even humorous about it as
some clerics might have been I went straight through and said naught

Poor Paddy Now for my part said King and you know I am not lavish
in my praises I consider Winton a firstclass type absolutely
firstclass

Haardly said the Reverend John Firstclass of the second class I
admit The very best type of second class buthe shook his headit
should have been a rat Paterll never be anything more than a Colonel
of Engineers

What do you base that verdict on said King stiffly

He came to me after prayerswith all his conscience

Poor old Pater Was it the mouse said little Hartopp

That and what he called his uncontrollable temper and his
responsibilities as subprefect

And you

If we had had what is vulgarly called a pijaw hed have had
hysterics So I recommended a dose of Epsom salts Hell take it
tooconscientiously Dont eat me King Perhaps hell be a KCB

Ten oclock struck and the Army class boys in the further studies coming
to their houses after an hours extra work passed along the gravel path
below Some one was chanting to the tune of White sand and grey sand
Dis te minorem quod geris imperas He stopped outside Mullins study
They heard Mullins window slide up and then Stalkys voice

Ah Goodevening Mullins my barbarus tortor Were the waits We
have come to inquire after the local Berserk Is he doin as well as can
be expected in his new careeah

Better than you will in a sec Stalky Mullins grunted

Glad of that We thought hed like to know that Paddy has been carried
to the sickhouse in ravin delirium They think its concussion of
the brain

Why he was all right at prayers Winton began earnestly and they
heard a laugh in the background as Mullins slammed down the window

Night Regulus Stalky sang out and the light footsteps went on

You see It sticks A little of it sticks among the barbarians said
King

Amen said the Reverend John Go to bed

Hi Hi Hold your horses Stop Well Well A lean man in a
sablelined overcoat leaped from a private car and barred my way up Pall
Mall You dont know me Youre excusable I wasnt wearing much of
anything last time we metin South Africa

The scales fell from my eyes and I saw him once more in a skyblue army
shirt behind barbed wire among Dutch prisoners bathing at Simonstown
more than a dozen years ago Why its ZiglerLaughton O Zigler
I cried Well I am glad to see you

Footnote  The Captive Traffics and Discoveries

Oh no You dont work any of your English on me So glad to see you
doncher knowan tata Do you reside in this village

No Im up here buying stores

Then you take my automobile Where to Oh I know them My Lord
Marshalton is one of the Directors Pigott drive to the Army and Navy
Cooperative Supply Association Limited Victoria Street Westminister

He settled himself on the deep dovecolour pneumatic cushions and his
smile was like the turning on of all the electrics His teeth were
whiter than the ivory fittings He smelt of rare soap and
cigarettessuch cigarettes as he handed me from a golden box with an
automatic lighter On my side of the car was a goldmounted mirror card
and toilette case I looked at him inquiringly

Yes he nodded two years after I quit the Cape Shes not an Ohio
girl though Shes in the country now Is that right Shes at our
little place in the country Well go there as soon as youre through
with your grocerylist Engagements The only engagement youve got is
to grab your gripget your bag from your hotel I meanand come right
along and meet her You are the captive of my bow and spear now

I surrender I said meekly Did the Zigler automatic gun do all
this I pointed to the car fittings

Psha Think of your rememberin that Well no The Zigler is a great
gunthe greatest everbut lifes too short an too interestin to
squander on pushing her in military society Ive leased my rights in
her to a PennsylvanianTransylvanian citizen full of mentality and moral
uplift If those things weigh with the Chancelleries of Europe he will
make good andI shall be surprised Excuse me

He bared his head as we passed the statue of the Great Queen outside
Buckingham Palace

A very great lady said he I have enjoyed her hospitality She
represents one of the most wonderful institutions in the world The next
is the one we are going to Mrs Zigler uses em and they break her up
every week on returned empties

Oh you mean the Stores I said

Mrs Zigler means it more They are quite ambassadorial in their
outlook I guess Ill wait outside and pray while you wrestle with em

My business at the Stores finished and my bag retrieved from the hotel
his moving palace slid us into the country

I owe it to you Zigler began as smoothly as the car to tell you
what I am now I represent the business end of the American Invasion
Not the blame cars themselvesI wouldnt be found dead in onebut the
tools that make em I am the Zigler HigherSpeed Tool and Lathe Trust
The Trust sir is entirely my ownin my own inventions I am the
Renzalaer tencylinder arialthe lightest aeroplaneengine on the
marketone price one power one guarantee I am the Orlebar
Paperwelt Pulppanel Company for aeroplane bodies and I am the Rush
Silencer for military aeroplanesabsolutely silentwhich the Continent
leases under royalty With three exceptions the British arent wise to
it yet Thats all I represent at present You saw me take off my hat
to your late Queen I owe every cent I have to that great an good Lady
Yes sir I came out of Africa after my eighteen months restcure and
openair treatment and seabathing as her prisoner of war like a giant
refreshed There wasnt anything could hold me when Id got my hooks
into it after that experience And to you as a representative British
citizen I say here and now that I regard you as the founder of the
family fortuneTommys and mine

But I only gave you some papers and tobacco

What more does any citizen need The Cullinan diamond wouldnt have
helped me as much then antalking about South Africa tell me

We talked about South Africa till the car stopped at the Georgian lodge
of a great park

Well get out here I want to show you a rather sightly view said
Zigler

We walked perhaps half a mile across timberdotted turf past a lake
entered a dark rhododendronplanted wood ticking with the noise of
pheasants feet and came out suddenly where five rides met at a small
classic temple between lichened stucco statues which faced a circle of
turf several acres in extent Irish yews of a size that I had never
seen before walled the sunless circle like cliffs of riven obsidian
except at the lower end where it gave on to a stretch of undulating
bare ground ending in a timbered slope halfamile away

Thats where the old Marshalton racecourse used to be said Zigler
That icehouse is called Floras Temple Nell Gwynne and Mrs Siddons
an Taglioni an all that crowd used to act plays here for King George
the Third Wasnt it Well George is the only king I play Let it go at
that This circle was the stage I guess The kings an the nobility sat
in Floras Temple I forget who sculped these statues at the door
Theyre the Comic and Tragic Muse But its a sightly view aint it

The sunlight was leaving the park I caught a glint of silver to the
southward beyond the wooded ridge

Thats the oceanthe Channel I mean said Zigler Its twentythree
miles as a man flies A sightly view aint it

I looked at the severe yews the dumb yelling mouths of the two statues
at the bluegreen shadows on the unsunned grass and at the still bright
plain in front where some deer were feeding

Its a most dramatic contrast but I think it would be better on a
summers day I said and we went on up one of the noiseless rides a
quarter of a mile at least till we came to the porticoed front of an
enormous Georgian pile Four footmen revealed themselves in a hall hung
with pictures

I hired this off of my Lord Marshalton Zigler explained while they
helped us out of our coats under the severe eyes of ruffed and
periwigged ancestors Yaas They always look at me too as if Id
blown in from the gutter Which of course I have Thats Mary Lady
Marshalton Old man Joshua painted her Do you see any likeness to my
Lord Marshalton Why havent you ever met up with him He was Captain
Mankeltowmy Royal British Artillery captain that blew up my gun in the
war an then tried to bury me against my religious principles
Yaas His father died and he got the lordship That was about all he
got by the time that your British deathduties were through with him So
he said Id oblige him by hiring his ranch Its a hell an a half of a
proposition to handle but TommyMrs Laughtonunderstands it Come
right in to the parlour and be very welcome

Footnote  The Captive Traffics and Discoveries

He guided me hand on shoulder into a babble of highpitched talk and
laughter that filled a vast drawingroom He introduced me as the
founder of the family fortunes to a little lithe darkeyed woman whose
speech and greeting were of the softlipped South She in turn presented
me to her mother a blackbrowed snowyhaired old lady with a cap of
priceless Venetian point hands that must have held many hearts in their
time and a dignity as unquestioned and unquestioning as an empress She
was indeed a Burton of Savannah who on their own ground outrank
the Lees of Virginia The rest of the company came from Buffalo
Cincinnati Cleveland and Chicago with here and there a softening
southern strain A party of young folk popped corn beneath a mantelpiece
surmounted by a Gainsborough Two portly men half hidden by a cased
harp discussed over sheaves of typewritten documents the terms of
some contract A knot of matrons talked servantsIrish versus
Germanacross the grand piano A youth ravaged an old bookcase while
beside him a tall girl stared at the portrait of a woman of many loves
dead three hundred years but now leaping to life and warning under the
shaded framelight In a corner halfadozen girls examined the glazed
tables that held the decorationsEnglish and foreignof the late Lord
Marshalton

See heah Would this be the Ordeh of the Gyartah one said pointing

I presoom likely No The Garter has Honey sworeI know that much
This is Tria juncta something

Oh whats that cunning little copper cross with For Valurr a third
cried

Say Look at here said the young man at the bookcase Heres a first
edition of Handley Cross and a Beewicks Birds right next to
itjust like so many best sellers Look Maidie

The girl beneath the picture half turned her body but not her eyes

You dont tell me she said slowly Their women amounted to
something after all

But Womans scope and outlook was vurry limmutted in those days one
of the matrons put in from the piano

Limmutted For her If they whurr I guess she was the limmut Who
was she Peters whurrs the catlog

A thin butler in charge of two footmen removing the teabatteries slid
to a table and handed her a blueandqilt book He was buttonholed by
one of the men behind the harp who wished to get a telephone call
through to Edinburgh

The local office shuts at six said Peters But I can get through
tohe named some townin ten minutes sir

That suits me Youll find me here when youve hitched up Oh say
Peters WeMister Olpherts an meaint goin by that early morning
train tomorrowbut the other oneon the other linewhatever
they call it

The nine twentyseven sir Yes sir Early breakfast will be at
halfpast eight and the car will be at the door at nine

Peters an imperious young voice called Whats the matteh with Lord
Marshaltons Ordeh of the Gyartah We cyant find it anyweah

Well miss I have heard that that Order is usually returned to His
Majesty on the death of the holder Yes miss Then in a whisper to a
footman More butter for the popcorn in King Charless Corner He
stopped behind my chair Your room is Number Eleven sir May I trouble
you for your keys

He left the room with a sixyearold maiden called Alice who had
announced she would not go to bed less Peter Peter Punkineater
takes meso there

He very kindly looked in on me for a moment as I was dressing for
dinner Not at all sir he replied to some compliment I paid him I
valeted the late Lord Marshalton for fifteen years He was very abrupt
in his movements sir As a rule I never received more than an hours
notice of a journey We used to go to Syria frequently I have been
twice to Babylon Mr and Mrs Ziglers requirements are comparatively
speaking few

But the guests

Very little out of the ordinary as soon as one knows their ordinaries
Extremely simple if I may say so sir

I had the privilege of taking Mrs Burton in to dinner and was rewarded
with an entirely new and to me rather shocking view of Abraham
Lincoln who she said had wasted the heritage of his land by blood and
fire and had surrendered the remnant to aliens My brother suh she
said fell at Gettysburg in order that Armenians should colonise New
England today If I took any interest in any damYankee outside of my
soninlaw Laughton yondah I should say that my brothers death had
been amply avenged

The man at her right took up the challenge and the war spread Her eyes
twinkled over the flames she had lit

Dont these folk she said a little later remind you of Arabs
picnicking under the Pyramids

Ive never seen the Pyramids I replied

Hm I didnt know you were as English as all that And when I laughed
Are you

Always It saves trouble

Now thats just what I find so significant among the Englishthis was
Alices mother I think with one elbow well forward among the salted
almonds Oh I know how you feel Madam Burton but a Northerner
like myselfIm Buffaloeven though we come over every yearnotices
the desire for comfort in England Theres so little conflict or uplift
in British society

But we like being comfortable I said

I know it Its very characteristic But aint it a little just a
little lacking in adaptability an imagination

They havent any need for adaptability Madam Burton struck in They
havent any Ellis Island standards to live up to

But we can assimilate the Buffalo woman charged on

Now you have done it I whispered to the old lady as the blessed
word assimilation woke up all the old arguments for and against

There was not a dull moment in that dinner for menor afterwards when
the boys and girls at the piano played the ragtime tunes of their own
land while their elders inexhaustibly interested replunged into the
discussion of that lands future till there was talk of cooncan When
all the company had been set to tables Zigler led me into his booklined
study where I noticed he kept his golfclubs and spoke simply as a
child gravely as a bishop of the years that were past since our
last meeting

Thats about all I guessup to date he said when he had unrolled
the bright map of his fortunes across three continents Bein rich
suits me So does your country sir My own country You heard what
that Detroit man said at dinner A Government of the alien by the
alien for the alien Mothers right too Lincoln killed us From the
highest motivesbut he killed us Oh say that reminds me Jever
kill a man from the highest motives

Not from any motiveas far as I remember

Well I have It dont weigh on my mind any but it was interesting
Life is interesting for a richfor anyman in England Yaas Life
in England is like settin in the front row at the theatre and never
knowin when the whole blame drama wont spill itself into your lap I
didnt always know that I lie abed now and I blush to think of some of
the breaks I made in South Africa About the British Not your official
method of doin business But the Spirit I was way way off on the
Spirit Are you acquainted with any other country where youd have to
kill a man or two to get at the National Spirit

Well I answered next to marrying one of its women killing one of
its men makes for pretty close intimacy with any country I take it you
killed a British citizen

Why no Our syndicate confined its operations to aliensdamfool
aliens Jever know an English lord called Lundie Looks like a
framefood and soap advertisement I imagine he was in your Supreme
Court before he came into his lordship

Footnote  The Puzzler Actions and Reactions

He is a lawyerwhat we call a Law Lorda Judge of Appealnot a real
hereditary lord

Thats as much beyond me as this Zigler slapped a fat Debrett on
the table But I presoom this unreal Law Lord Lundie is kind o real in
his decisions I judged so Andone more question Ever meet a man
called Walen

Dyou mean BurtonWalen the editor of I mentioned the journal

Thats him Looks like a tough talks like a Maxim and trains with
kings

He does I said BurtonWalen knows all the crowned heads of Europe
intimately Its his hobby

Well theres the whole outfit for youexceptin my Lord Marshalton
n Mankeltow an me All active murderersspecially the Law Lordor
accessories after the fact And what do they hand you out for that in
this country

Twenty years I believe was my reply

He reflected a moment

Nooo he said and followed it with a smokering Twenty months at
the Cape is my limit Say murder aint the soulshatterin event those
naturefakers in the magazines make out It develops naturally like any
other proposition Say jever play this golf game Its come up in
the States from Maine to California an were prodoocin all the
champions in sight Not a business mans play but interestin Ive got
a golflinks in the park here that they tell me is the finest inland
course ever I had to pay extra for that when I hired the ranchelast
year It was just before I signed the papers that our murder
eventuated My Lord Marshalton he asked me down for the weekend to fix
up something or otherabout Peters and the linen I think twas Mrs
Zigler took a holt of the proposition She understood Peters from the
word go There wasnt any houseparty only fifteen or twenty folk A
full house is thirtytwo Tommy tells me Guess we must be near on that
tonight In the smokingroom here my Lord MarshaltonMankeltow that
wasintroduces me to this Walen man with the nose Hed been in the War
too from start to finish He knew all the columns and generals that Id
battled with in the days of my Zigler gun We kinder fell into each
others arms an let the harsh world go by for a while

Walen he introduces me to your Lord Lundie He was a new proposition
to me If he hadnt been a lawyer hed have made a lovely cattleking I
thought I had played poker some Another of my breaks Yaas It cost me
eleven hundred dollars besides what Tommy said when I retired I have no
fault to find with your hereditary aristocracy or your judiciary or
your press

Sunday we all went to Church across the Park here Psha Think o
your rememberin my religion Ive become an Episcopalian since I
married Yaas After lunch Walen did his crownedheadsofEurope
stunt in the smokinroom here He was long on Kings And Continental
crises I do not pretend to follow British domestic politics but in the
aeroplane business a man has to know something of international
possibilities At present you British are settin in kimonoes on
dynamite kegs Walens talk put me wise on the location and size of some
of the kegs Yaas

After that we four went out to look at those golflinks I was hirin
We each took a club Minehe glanced at a great tan bag by the
fireplacewas the beginners friendthe cleek Well sir this golf
proposition took a holt of me as quick asquick as death They had to
prise me off the greens when it got too dark to see and then we went
back to the house I was walkin ahead with my Lord Marshalton talkin
beginners golf I was the man who ought to have been killed by
rights We cut cross lots through the woods to Floras Templethat
place I showed you this afternoon Lundie and Walen were maybe twenty
or thirty rod behind us in the dark Marshalton and I stopped at the
theatre to admire at the ancestral yewtrees He took me right under the
biggestKing Somebodys Yewand while I was spannin it with my
handkerchief he says Look heah just as if it was a rabbitand down
comes a biplane into the theatre with no more noise than the dead My
Rush Silencer is the only one on the market that allows that sort of
gumshoe work What A biplanewith two men in it Both men jump out
and start fussin with the engines I was starting to tell MankeltowI
cant remember to call him Marshalton any morethat it looked as if the
Royal British Flying Corps had got on to my Rush Silencer at last but
he steps out from under the yew to these two Stealthy Steves and says
Whats the trouble Can I be of any service He thoughtso did
Itwas some of the boys from Aldershot or Salisbury Well sir from
there on the situation developed like a motionpicture in Hell The man
on the nigh side of the machine whirls round pulls his gun and fires
into Mankeltows face I laid him out with my cleek automatically Any
one who shoots a friend of mine gets whats comin to him if Im within
reach He drops Mankeltow rubs his neck with his handkerchief The man
the far side of the machine starts to run Lundie down the ride or it
might have been Walen shouts Whats happened Mankeltow says
Collar that chap

The second man runs ringaringoroses round the machine one hand
reachin behind him Mankeltow heads him off to me He breaks blind for
Walen and Lundie who are runnin up the ride Theres some sort of
mixup among em which its too dark to see and a thud Walen says
Oh well collared Lundie says Thats the only thing I never learned
at Harrow Mankeltow runs up to em still rubbin his neck and
says He didnt fire at me It was the other chap Where is he

Ive stretched him alongside his machine I says

Are they poachers says Lundie

No Airmen I cant make it out says Mankeltow

Look at here says Walen kind of brusque This man aint breathin
at all Didnt you hear somethin crack when he lit Lundie

My God says Lundie Did I I thought it was my suspendersno he
said braces

Right there I left them and sort o tiptoed back to my man hopin hed
revived and quit But he hadnt That darned cleek had hit him on the
back of the neck just where his helmet stopped Hed got his I knew
it by the way the head rolled in my hands Then the others came up the
ride totin their load No mistakin that shuffle on grass Dyou
remember itin South Africa Yaas

Hsh says Lundie Do you know Ive broken this mans neck

Same here I says

What Both says Mankeltow

Nonsense says Lord Lundie Whod have thought he was that out of
training A man oughtnt to fly if he aint fit

What did they want here anyway said Walen and Mankeltow says We
cant leave them in the open Some onell come Carry em to
Floras Temple

We toted em again and laid em out on a stone bench They were still
dead in spite of our best attentions We knew it but we went through
the motions till it was quite dark Wonder if all murderers do that
We want a light on this says Walen after a spell There ought to be
one in the machine Why didnt they light it

We came out of Floras Temple and shut the doors behind us Some
stars were showing thensame as when Cain did his little act I guess
I climbed up and searched the machine She was very well equipped I
found two electric torches in clips alongside her barometers by the
rear seat

What make is she says Mankeltow

Continental Renzalaer I says My engines and my Rush Silencer

Walen whistles Herelet me look he says and grabs the other
torch She was sure well equipped We gathered up an armful of cameras
an maps an notebooks an an album of mounted photographs which we
took to Floras Temple and spread on a marbletopped table Ill show
you tomorrow which the King of Naples had presented to grandfather
Marshalton Walen starts to go through em We wanted to know why our
friends had been so prejudiced against our society

Wait a minute says Lord Lundie Lend me a handkerchief

He pulls out his own and Walen contributes his greenandred bandanna
and Lundie covers their faces Now he says well go into the
evidence

There wasnt any flaw in that evidence Walen read out their last
observations and Mankeltow asked questions and Lord Lundie sort o
summarised and I looked at the photos in the album Jever see a
birdseye telephotosurvey of England for military purposes Its
interestin but indecentlike turnin a man upside down None of those
closerange panoramas of forts could have been taken without my
Rush Silencer

I wish we was as thorough as they are says Mankeltow when Walen
stopped translatin

Weve been thorough enough says Lord Lundie The evidence against
both accused is conclusive Any other country would give em seven years
in a fortress We should probably give em eighteen months as
firstclass misdemeanants But their case he says is out of our
hands We must review our own Mr Zigler he said will you tell us
what steps you took to bring about the death of the first accused I
told him He wanted to know specially whether Id stretched first
accused before or after he had fired at Mankeltow Mankeltow testified
hed been shot at and exhibited his neck as evidence It was scorched

Now Mr Walen says Lord Lundie Will you kindly tell us what steps
you took with regard to the second accused

The man ran directly at me me lord says Walen I said Oh no you
dont and hit him in the face

Lord Lundie lifts one hand and uncovers second accuseds face There
was a bruise on one cheek and the chin was all greened with grass He
was a heavybuilt man

What happened after that says Lord Lundie

To the best of my remembrance he turned from me towards your
lordship

Then Lundie goes ahead I stooped and caught the man round the
ankles he says The sudden check threw him partially over my left
shoulder I jerked him off that shoulder still holding his ankles and
he fell heavily on it would appear the point of his chin death being
instantaneous

Death being instantaneous says Walen

Lord Lundie takes off his gown and wigyou could see him do itand
becomes our fellowmurderer Thats our case he says I know how I
should direct the jury but its an undignified business for a Lord of
Appeal to lift his hand to and some of my learned brothers he says
might be disposed to be facetious

I guess I cant be properly sensitised Any one who steered me out of
that trouble might have had the laugh on me for generations But Im
only a millionaire I said wed better search second accused in case
hed been carryin concealed weapons

That certainly is a point says Lord Lundie But the question for
the jury would be whether I exercised more force than was necessary to
prevent him from usin them I didnt say anything He wasnt talkin
my language Second accused had his gun on him sure enough but it had
jammed in his hippocket He was too fleshy to reach behind for business
purposes and he didnt look a gunman anyway Both of em carried wads
of private letters By the time Walen had translated we knew how many
children the fat one had at home and when the thin one reckoned to be
married Too bad Yaas

Says Walen to me while we was rebuttonin their jackets they was not
in uniform Ever read a book called The Wreckers Mr Zigler

Not that I recall at the present moment I says

Well do he says Youd appreciate it Youd appreciate it now I
assure you

Ill remember I says But I dont see how this song and dance helps
us any Heres our corpses heres their machine and daylights
bound to come

Heavens That reminds me says Lundie What times dinner

Halfpast eight says Mankeltow Its halfpast five now We knocked
off golf at twenty to and if they hadnt been such silly asses firin
pistols like civilians wed have had them to dinner Why they might be
sitting with us in the smokingroom this very minute he says Then he
said that no man had a right to take his profession so seriously as
these two mountebanks

How interestin says Lundie Ive noticed this impatient attitude
toward their victim in a good many murderers I never understood it
before Of course its the disposal of the body that annoys em Now I
wonder he says who our case will come up before Lets run through
it again

Then Walen whirls in Hed been bitin his nails in a corner We was
all nerved up by now Me The worst of the bunch I had to think for
Tommy as well

We cant be tried says Walen We mustnt be tried Itll make
an infernal international stink What did I tell you in the smokingroom
after lunch The tensions at breakingpoint already This ud snap it
Cant you see that

I was thinking of the legal aspect of the case says Lundie With a
good jury wed likely be acquitted

Acquitted says Walen Whod dare acquit us in the face of what ud
be demanded bythe other party Did you ever hear of the War of
Jenkins ear Ever hear of Mason and Slidel Ever hear of an
ultimatum You know who these two idiots are you know who we area
Lord of Appeal a Viscount of the English peerage and meme knowing
all I know which the men who know dam well know that I do know Its
our necks or Armageddon Which do you think this Government would
choose We cant be tried he says

Then I expect Ill have to resign me club Lundie goes on I dont
think thats ever been done before by an exofficio member I must ask
the secretary I guess he was kinder bunkered for the minute or maybe
twas the lordship comin out on him

Rot says Mankeltow Walens right We cant afford to be tried
Well have to bury them but my headgardener locks up all the tools at
five oclock

Not on your life says Lundie He was on deck againas the
highclass lawyer Right or wrong if we attempt concealment of the
bodies were done for

Im glad of that says Mankeltow because after all it aint
cricket to bury em

Somehowbut I know I aint Englishthat consideration didnt worry
me as it ought An besides I was thinkinI had toan Id begun to
see a light way offa little glimmerin light o salvation

Then what are we to do says Walen Zigler what do you advise
Your necks in it too

Gentlemen I says something Lord Lundie let fall a while back gives
me an idea I move that this committee empowers Big Claus and Little
Claus who have elected to commit suicide in our midst to leave the
premises as they came Im asking you to take big chances I says
but theyre all weve got and then I broke for the biplane

Dont tell me the English cant think as quick as the next man when
its up to them They lifted em out o Floras Templereverent but
not wastin timewhilst I found out what had brought her down One
cylinder was misfirin I didnt stop to fix it My Renzalaer will hold
up on six Weve proved that If her crew had relied on my guarantees
theyd have been halfway home by then instead of takin their seats
with hangin heads like they was ashamed They ought to have been
ashamed too playin gunmen in a British peers park I took big
chances startin her without controls but twas a dead still night an
a clear runyou saw itacross the Theatre into the park and I prayed
shed rise before she hit high timber I set her all I dared for a quick
lift I told Mankeltow that if I gave her too much nose shed be liable
to upend and flop He didnt want another inquest on his estate No
sir So I had to fix her up in the dark Yaas

I took big chances too while those other three held on to her and I
worked her up to full power My Renzalaers no ventilationfan to pull
against But I climbed out just in time Id hitched the signallin lamp
to her tail sos we could track her Otherwise with my Rush Silencer
we mights well have shooed an owl out of a barn She left just that way
when we let her go No sound except the propellersWhoooooo
Whoooooo There was a dip in the ground ahead It hid her lamp for a
secondbut theres no such thing as time in real life Then that lamp
travelled up the far slope slowtoo slow Then it kinder lifted we
judged Then it sure was liftin Then it lifted good Dyou know why
Our four naked perspirin souls was out there underneath her hikin her
heavens high Yes sir We did it And that lamp kept liftin and
liftin Then she sideslipped My God she sideslipped twice which
was what Id been afraid of all along Then she straightened up and
went away climbin to glory for that blessed star of our hope got
smaller and smaller till we couldnt track it any more Then we
breathed We hadnt breathed any since their arrival but we didnt know
it till we breathed that timeall together Then we dug our
fingernails out of our palms an came alive againin instalments

Lundie spoke first We therefore commit their bodies to the air he
says an puts his cap on

The deepthe deep says Walen Its just twentythree miles to the
Channel

Poor chaps Poor chaps says Mankeltow Wed have had em to dinner
if they hadnt lost their heads I cant tell you how this distresses
me Laughton

Well look at here Arthur I says Its only Gods Own Mercy you
an me aint lyin in Floras Temple now and if that fat man had known
enough to fetch his gun around while he was runnin Lord Lundie and
Walen would have been alongside us

I see that he says But were alive and theyre dead dont ye
know

I know it I says Thats where the dead are always so damned unfair
on the survivors

I see that too he says But Id have given a good deal if it hadnt
happened poor chaps

Amen says Lundie Then Oh then we sorter walked back two an two
to Floras Temple an lit matches to see we hadnt left anything behind
Walen he had confiscated the notebooks before they left There was the
first mans pistol which wed forgot to return him lyin on the stone
bench Mankeltow puts his hand on ithe never touched the triggeran
bein an automatic of course the blame thing jarred offspiteful as
a rattler

Look out Theyll have one of us yet says Walen in the dark But
they didntthe Lord hadnt quit being our shepherdand we heard the
bullet zip across the veldtquite like old times Yaas

Swine says Mankeltow

After that I didnt hear any more Poor chap talk Me I never
worried about killing my man I was too busy figurin how a British
jury might regard the proposition I guess Lundie felt that way too

Oh but say We had an interestin time at dinner Folks was expected
whose auto had hung up on the road They hadnt wired and Peters had
laid two extra places We noticed em as soon as we sat down Id hate
to say how noticeable they were Mankeltow with his neck bandaged hed
caught a relaxed throat golfin sent for Peters and told him to take
those empty places awayif you please It takes something to rattle
Peters He was rattled that time Nobody else noticed anything
And now

Where did they come down I asked as he rose

In the Channel I guess There was nothing in the papers about em
Shall we go into the drawinroom and see what these boys and girls are
doin But say aint life in England interestin




     REBIRTH

       If any God should say
         I will restore
       The world her yesterday
         Whole as before
     My Judgment blasted itwho would not lift
     Heart eye and hand in passion oer the gift

       If any God should will
         To wipe from mind
       The memory of this ill
         Which is mankind
     In soul and substance nowwho would not bless
     Even to tears His lovingtenderness

       If any God should give
         Us leave to fly
       These present deaths we live
         And safely die
     In those lost lives we lived ere we were born
     What man but would not laugh the excuse to scorn

       For we are what we are
         So broke to blood
       And the strict works of war
         So long subdued
     To sacrifice that threadbare Death commands
     Hardly observance at our busier hands

       Yet we were what we were
         And fashioned so
       It pleases us to stare
         At the far show
     Of unbelievable years and shapes that flit
     In our own likeness on the edge of it



The Horse Marines



The Rt Hon RB Haldane Secretary of State for War was
questioned in the House of Commons on April th about the rockinghorses
which the War Office is using for the purpose of teaching recruits to
ride Lord Ronaldshay asked the War Secretary if rockinghorses were to
be supplied to all the cavalry regiments for teaching recruits to ride
The noble Lord replied Mr Haldane is doubtless alluding to certain
dummy horses on rockers which have been tested with very satisfactory
results The mechanical steed is a wooden horse with an astonishing
tail It is painted brown and mounted on swinging rails The recruit
leaps into the saddle and pulls at the reins while the ridinginstructor
rocks the animal to and fro with his foot The rockinghorses are being
made at Woolwich They are quite cheap

Daily Paper

Footnote  Now Viscount Haldane of Cloan

My instructions to Mr Leggatt my engineer had been accurately obeyed
He was to bring my car on completion of annual overhaul from Coventry
via London to Southampton Docks to await my arrival and very pretty
she looked under the steamers side among the railway lines at six in
the morning Next to her new paint and varnish I was most impressed by
her four brandnew tyres

But I didnt order new tyres I said as we moved away These are
Irresilients too

Trebleribbed said Leggatt Diamondstud sheathing

Then there has been a mistake

Oh no sir theyre gratis

The number of motor manufacturers who give away complete sets of
trebleribbed Irresilient tyres is so limited that I believe I asked
Leggatt for an explanation

I dont know that I could very well explain sir was the answer It
ud come better from Mr Pyecroft Hes on leaf at Portsmouthstaying
with his uncle His uncle ad the body all night Id defy you to find a
scratch on her even with a microscope

Then we will go home by the Portsmouth road I said

And we went at those speeds which are allowed before the workingday
begins or the police are thawed out We were blocked near Portsmouth by
a battalion of Regulars on the move

Whitsuntide manoeuvres just ending said Leggatt Theyve had a
fortnight in the Downs

He said no more until we were in a narrow street somewhere behind
Portsmouth Town Railway Station where he slowed at a greengrocery
shop The door was open and a small old man sat on three potatobaskets
swinging his feet over a stooping blue back

You call that shinin em he piped Can you see your face in em
yet No Then shine em or Ill give you a beltin youll remember

If you stop kickin me in the mouth perhaps Id do better said
Pyecrofts voice meekly

We blew the horn

Pyecroft arose put away the brushes and received us not otherwise than
as a king in his own country

Are you going to leave me up here all day said the old man

Pyecroft lifted him down and he hobbled into the back room

Its his corns Pyecroft explained You cant shine corny feetand
he hasnt had his breakfast

I havent had mine either I said

Breakfast for two more uncle Pyecroft sang out

Go out an buy it then was the answer or else its halfrations

Pyecroft turned to Leggatt gave him his marketing orders and
despatched him with the coppers

I have got four new tyres on my car I began impressively

Yes said Mr Pyecroft You have and I will sayhe patted my
cars bonnetyou earned em

I want to know why I went on

Quite justifiable You havent noticed anything in the papers have
you

Ive only just landed I havent seen a paper for weeks

Then you can lend me a virgin ear Theres been a scandal in the
Junior Servicethe Army I believe they call em

A bag of coffeebeans pitched on the counter Roast that said the
uncle from within

Pyecroft rigged a small coffeeroaster while I took down the shutters
and sold a young lady in curlpapers two bunches of mixed greens and one
soft orange

Sickly stuff to handle on an empty stomach aint it said Pyecroft

What about my new tyres I insisted

Oh any amount But the question ishe looked at me steadilyis
this what you might call a courtmartial or a postmortem inquiry

Strictly a postmortem said I

That being so said Pyecroft we can rapidly arrive at facts Last
Thursdaythe shutters go behind those basketslast Thursday at five
bells in the forenoon watch otherwise tenthirty AM your Mr Leggatt
was discovered on Westminster Bridge laying his course for the Old
Kent Road

But that doesnt lead to Southampton I interrupted

Then perhaps he was swinging the car for compasses Be that as it may
we found him in that latitude simultaneous as Jules and me was ong
route for Waterloo to rejoin our respective shipsor Navies I should
say Jules was a permissionaire which meant being on leaf same as
me from a French cassowarycruiser at Portsmouth A party of her trusty
and wellbeloved petty officers ad been seeing London chaperoned by
the RC Chaplain Jules ad detached himself from the squadron and was
cruisin on his own when I joined him in company of copious
ladyfriends But mark you your Mr Leggatt drew the line at the
girls Loud and long he drew it

Im glad of that I said

You may be He adopted the puristical formation from the first Yes
he said when we was annealing him atbut you wouldnt know the pubI
am going to Southampton he says and Ill stretch a point to go
via Portsmouth but says he seeing what sort of one hell of a
time invariably trarnspires when we cruise together Mr Pyecroft I do
not feel myself justified towards my generous and longsuffering
employer in takin on that kind of ballast as well I assure you he
considered your interests

And the girls I asked

Oh I left that to Jules Im a monogomite by nature So we embarked
strictly ong garong But I should tell you in case he didnt that
your Mr Leggatts care for your interests ad extended to sheathing the
car in matting and gunnybags to preserve her paintwork She was all
swathed up like an Italian baby

He is careful about his paintwork I said

For a man with no Service experience I should say he was fair homicidal
on the subject If wed been Marines he couldnt have been more pointed
in his allusions to our hobnailed socks However we reduced him to a
malleable condition and embarked for Portsmouth Id seldom rejoined
my vaisseau ong automobile avec a fur coat and goggles Nor
ad Jules

Did Jules say much I asked helplessly turning the handle of the
coffeeroaster

Thats where I pitied the pore beggar He adnt the language so to
speak He was confined to heavings and shruggins and copious Mong
Jews The French are very badly fitted with reliefvalves And then our
Mr Leggatt drove He drove

Was he in a very malleable condition

Not him We recognised the value of his cargo from the outset He
hadnt a chance to get more than moist at the edges After which we went
to sleep and now well go to breakfast

We entered the back room where everything was in order and a screeching
canary made us welcome The uncle had added sausages and piles of
buttered toast to the kippers The coffee cleared with a piece of
fishskin was a revelation

Leggatt who seemed to know the premises had run the car into the tiny
backyard where her mirrorlike back almost blocked up the windows He
minded shop while we ate Pyecroft passed him his rations through a flap
in the door The uncle ordered him in after breakfast to wash up and
he jumped in his gaiters at the old mans commands as he has never
jumped to mine

To resoom the postmortem said Pyecroft lighting his pipe My
slumbers were broken by the propeller ceasing to revolve and by vile
language from your Mr Leggatt

II Leggatt began a bluechecked duster in one hand and a cup in
the other

When youre wanted aft youll be sent for Mr Leggatt said Pyecroft
amiably Its clean mess decks for you now Resooming once more we was
on a lonely and desolate ocean near Portsdown surrounded by gorse
bushes and a Boy Scout was stirring my stomach with his little
copperstick

You count ten he says

Very good Boy Jones I says count em and I hauled him in over
the gunnel and ten I gave him with my large flat hand The remarks he
passed lying face down tryin to bite my leg would have reflected
credit on any Service Having finished I dropped him overboard again
which was my gross political error I ought to ave killed him because
he began signallingrapid and accuratein a souwesterly direction
Few equatorial calms are to be apprehended when BPs little pets take
to signallin Make a note o that Three minutes later we were stopped
and boarded by Scoutsup our backs down our necks and in our boots
The last I heard from your Mr Leggatt as he went under brushin em
off his cap was thanking Heaven hed covered up the new paintwork with
mats An eroic soul

Not a scratch on her body said Leggatt pouring out the
coffeegrounds

And Jules said I

Oh Jules thought the much advertised Social Revolution had begun but
his mackintosh hampered him

You told me to bring the mackintosh Leggatt whispered to me

And when I ad em half convinced he was a French vicomte coming down
to visit the CommanderinChief at Portsmouth he tried to take it off
Seeing his uniform underneath some sucking Sherlock Holmes of the Pink
Eye Patrol they called him Eddy deduced that I wasnt speaking
the truth Eddy said I was tryin to sneak into Portsmouth
unobservedunobserved mark youand join hands with the enemy It
trarnspired that the Scouts was conducting a fieldday against opposin
forces ably assisted by all branches of the Service and they was so
afraid the car wouldnt count ten points to them in the fray that
theyd have scalped us but for the intervention of an umpirealso in
short underdrawers A fleshy sight

Here Mr Pyecroft shut his eyes and nodded That umpire he said
suddenly was our Mr Morsheda gentleman whose acquaintance you have
already made and profited by if I mistake not

Footnote  Their Lawful Occasions Traffics and Discoveries

Oh was the Navy in it too I said for I had read of wild doings
occasionally among the Boy Scouts on the Portsmouth Road in which Navy
Army and the world at large seemed to have taken part

The Navy was in it I was the only one out of itfor several
seconds Our Mr Morshed failed to recognise me in my fur boa and my
appealin winks at im behind your goggles didnt arrive But when Eddy
darling had told his story I saluted which is difficult in furs and I
stated I was bringin him dispatches from the North My Mr Morshed
cohered on the instant Ive never known his ethergram installations out
of order yet Go and guard your blessed road he says to the Fratton
Orphan Asylum standing at attention all round him and when they was
removedPyecroft he says still sotte voce what in HongKong are
you doing with this duncoloured sampan

It was your Mr Leggatts paintprotective matting which caught his
eye She did resemble a sampan especially about the sternworks At
these remarks I naturally threw myself on is bosom so far as Service
conditions permitted and revealed him all mentioning that the car was
yours You know his way of working his lips like a rabbit Yes he was
quite pleased His car he kept murmuring working his lips like a
rabbit I owe im more than a trifle for things he wrote about me Ill
keep the car

Your Mr Leggatt now injected some semimutinous remarks to the effect
that he was your chauffeur in charge of your car and as such capable
of so acting Mr Morshed threw him a glarnce It sufficed Didnt it
suffice Mr Leggatt

I knew if something didnt happen something worse would said
Leggatt It never fails when youre aboard

And Jules I demanded

Jules was so to speak panicking in a watertight flat through his
unfortunate lack of language I had to introduce him as part of the
entente cordiale and he was put under arrest too Then we sat on the
grass and smoked while Eddy and Co violently annoyed the traffic on
the Portsmouth Road till the umpires all in short panties conferred
on the valuable lessons of the fieldday and added up points same as at
targetpractice I didnt hear their conclusions but our Mr Morshed
delivered a farewell address to Eddy and Co tellin em they ought to
have deduced from a hundred signs about me that I was a friendly
bringin in dispatches from the North We left em tryin to find those
signs in the Scout book and we reached Mr Morsheds hotel at
Portsmouth at  PM ong automobile Here endeth the
first chapter

Begin the second I said

The uncle and Leggatt had finished washing up and were seated smoking
while the damp duster dried at the fire

About what time was it said Pyecroft to Leggatt when our Mr
Morshed began to talk about uncles

When he came back to the bar after hed changed into those ratcatcher
clothes said Leggatt

Thats right Pye said he have you an uncle I have I says
Heres santy to him and I finished my sherry and bitters to
you uncle

Thats right said Pyecrofts uncle sternly If you hadnt Id have
belted you worth rememberin Emmanuel I had the body all night

Pyecroft smiled affectionately So you ad uncle an beautifully you
looked after her But as I was saying I have an uncle too says Mr
Morshed dark and lowering Yet somehow I cant love him I want to
mortify the beggar Volunteers to mortify my uncle one pace to
the front

I took Jules with me the regulation distance Jules was getting
interested Your Mr Leggatt preserved a strictly nootral attitude

Youre a pressed man says our Mr Morshed I owe your late employer
much so to say The car will manoeuvre all night as requisite

Mr Leggatt come out noble as your employee and by Eavens divine
grace instead of arguing he pleaded his new paint and varnish which
was Mr Morsheds one vital spot hes lootenant on one of the new
catchemaliveos now True says he paints an oly thing Ill
give you one hour to arrange a modus vivendi Full bunkers and steam
ready by  PM tonight if you please

Even so Mr Leggatt was far from content I ad to arrange the
details We run her into the yard here Pyecroft nodded through the
window at my cars glossy backpanels We took off the body with its
mats and put it in the stable substitooting and that yards a tight
fit for extensive repairs the body of uncles blue delivery cart It
overhung a trifle but after Id lashed it I knew it wouldnt fetch
loose Thus in our composite cruiser we repaired once more to the
hotel and was immediately dispatched to the toyshop in the High Street
where we took aboard one rockinghorse which was waiting for us

Took aboard what I cried

One fourteenhand dapplegrey rockinghorse with pure green rockers
and detachable tail pair gashly glass eyes complete set orrible
grinnin teeth and two bloodyred nostrils which protruding from the
brown papers produced the tout ensemble of a Juju sacrifice in the
Benin campaign Do I make myself comprehensible

Perfectly Did you say anything I asked

Only to Jules To him I says wishing to try him Allez  votre
bateau Je say mon Lootenong Eel voo donneray porkwor To me says
he Vous ong ate hurroo Jamay de la vee and I saw by his eye hed
taken on for the full term of the war Jules was a blueeyed
brindlehaired beggar of a useful make and inquirin habits Your Mr
Leggatt he only groaned

Leggatt nodded It was like nightmares he said It was like
nightmares

Once more then Pyecroft swept on we returned to the hotel and
partook of a sumptuous repast under the able and genial chairmanship of
our Mr Morshed who laid his projecks unreservedly before us In the
first place he says opening out bicyclemaps my uncle who I
regret to say is a brigadiergeneral has sold his alleged soul to
Dicky Bridoon for a feathery hat and a pair o gilt spurs Jules
conspuez loncle So Jules youll be glad to hear

One minute Pye I said Who is Dicky Bridoon

I dont usually mingle myself up with the bickerings of the Junior
Service but it trarnspired that he was Secretary o State for Civil
War an hed been issuing mechanical leatherbelly geegees which
doctors recommend for tumourto the British cavalry in loo of real meat
horses to learn to ride on Dont you remember there was quite a stir
in the papers owing to the cavalry not appreciatin em But thats a
minor item The main point was that our uncle in his capacity of
brigadiergeneral mark you had wrote to the papers highly approvin o
Dicky Bridoons mechanical substitutes an ad thus obtained
promotionall same as a agnosticle stoker psalmsingin imself up the
Service under a pious captain At that point of the narrative we caught
a phosphorescent glimmer why the rockinghorse might have been issued
but none the less the navigation was intricate Omitting the fact it was
dark and cloudy our brigadieruncle lay somewhere in the South Downs
with his brigade which was manoeuvrin at Whitsum manoeuvres on a large
scaleRed Army versus Blue et cetera an all we ad to go by was
those flapping bicyclemaps and your Mr Leggatts groans

I was thinking what the Downs mean after dark said Leggatt angrily

They was worth thinkin of said Pyecroft When we had studied the
map till it fair spun we decided to sally forth and creep for uncle by
hand in the dark dark night an present im with the rockinghorse So
we embarked at  PM

One minute again please How much did Jules understand by that time
I asked

Sufficient unto the dayor night perhaps I should say He told our
Mr Morshed hed follow him more sang frays which is French for dead
drunk or damned Barrin is paucity o language there wasnt a
blemish on Jules But what I wished to imply was when we climbed into
the back parts of the car our Lootenant Morshed says to me I doubt if
Id flick my cigarends about too lavish Mr Pyecroft We ought to be
sitting on five pounds worth of selected fireworks and I think the
rockets are your end Not being able to smoke with my ead over the
side I threw it away and then your Mr Leggatt aving been as nearly
mutinous as it pays to be with my Mr Morshed arched his back
and drove

Where did he drive to please said I

Primerrily in search of any or either or both armies seconderrily of
course in search of our brigadieruncle Not finding him on the road
we ran about the grass looking for him This took us to a great many
places in a short time Ow eavenly that lilac did smell on top of that
first Downstinkin its blossomin little heart out

I adnt leesure to notice said Mr Leggatt The Downs were full o
chalkpits and wed no lights

We ad the bicyclelamp to look at the map by Didnt you notice the
old lady at the window where we saw the man in the nightgown I thought
nightgowns as sleepin rig was extinck so to speak

I tell you I adnt leesure to notice Leggatt repeated

Thats odd Then what might ave made you tell the sentry at the first
camp we found that you was the Daily Express deliverywaggon

You cant touch pitch without being defiled Leggatt answered Oo
told the officer in the bath we were umpires

Well he asked us That was when we found the Territorial battalion
undressin in slow time It lay on the left flank o the Blue Army and
it cackled as it lay too But it gave us our position as regards the
respective armies We wandered a little more and at  PM not
having had a road under us for twenty minutes we scaled the heights of
something or otherwhich are about six hundred feet high Here we
alted to tighten the lashings of the superstructure and we smelt
leather and horses three counties deep all round We was as you might
say in the thick of it

Ah says my Mr Morshed My orizon has indeed broadened What a
little thing is an uncle Mr Pyecroft in the presence o these
glitterin constellations Simply ludicrous he says to waste a
rockinghorse on an individual We must socialise it But we must get
their eads up first Touch off one rocket if you please

I touched off a green threepounder which rose several thousand metres
and burst into gorgeous stars Reproduce the manoeuvre he says at
the other end o this ridgeif it dont end in another cliff So we
steamed down the ridge a mile and a half east and then I let Jules
touch off a pink rocket or hed ha kissed me That was his only way to
express his emotions so to speak Their heads come up then all around
us to the extent o thousands We hears bugles like cocks crowing below
and on the top of it a most impressive sound which Id never enjoyed
before because itherto Id always been an inteegral part of it so to
saythe noise of ole armies gettin under arms They must ave
anticipated a night attack I imagine Most impressive Then we eard a
threshinmachine Tutt Tutt This is childish says Lootenant
Morshed We cant wait till theyve finished cutting chaff for their
horses We must make em understand were not to be trifled with
Expedite em with another rocket Mr Pyecroft

Its barely possible sir I remarks that thats a searchlight
churnin up and by the time we backed into a providential chalk
cutting which was where our first tyre went pungo she broke out to the
northward and began searching the ridge A smart bit o work

Twasnt a puncture The inner tube had nipped because we skidded so
Leggatt interrupted

While your Mr Leggatt was effectin repairs another searchlight broke
out to the southward and the two of em swept our ridge on both sides
Right at the west end of it they showed us the ground rising into a
hill so to speak crowned with what looked like a little fort Morshed
saw it before the beams shut off Thats the key of the position he
says Occupy it at all hazards

I havent half got occupation for the next twenty minutes says your
Mr Leggatt rootin and blasphemin in the dark Mark now ow
Morshed changed his tactics to suit is environment Right says he
Ill stand by the ship Mr Pyecroft and Jules oblige me by doubling
along the ridge to the east with all the maroons and crackers you can
carry without spilling Read the directions careful for the maroons Mr
Pyecroft and touch them off at halfminute intervals Jules represents
musketry an maxim fire under your command Remember its death or
Salisbury Gaol Probly both

By these means and some moderately ard runnin we distracted em to
the eastward Maroons you may not be aware are same as bombs with the
anarchism left out In confined spots like chalkpits they knock a
fourpointseven silly But you should read the directions beforeand
In the intervals of the slow but welldirected fire of my cowguns
Jules who had found a sheeppond in the dark a little lower down gave
what you might call a cinematograph reproduction o sporadic musketry
They was large size crackers and he concluded with the dull sickenin
thud o blind shells burstin on soft ground

How did he manage that I said

You throw a lighted squib into water and youll see said Pyecroft
Thus then we improvised till supplies was exhausted and the
surrounding landscapes fair owled and ummed at us The Jun or Service
might ave ad their doubts about the rockets but they couldnt overlook
our gunfire Both sides tumbled out full of initiative I told Jules no
two flatfeet ad any right to be as happy as us and we went back
along the ridge to the derelict and there was our Mr Morshed
apostrophin his andiwork over fifty square mile o country with
Attend all ye who list to hear out of the Fifth Reader Hed got as
far as And roused the shepherds o Stonehenge the rangers o Beaulieu
when we come up and he drew our attention to its truth as well as its
beauty Thats rare in poetry Im told He went right on toThe red
glare on Skiddaw roused those beggars at Carlislewhich he pointed out
was poetic license for Leith Hill This allowed your Mr Leggatt time to
finish pumpin up his tyres I eard the sweat op off his nose

You know what it is sir said poor Leggatt to me

It warfted across my mind as I listened to what was trarnspirin that
it might be easier to make the mess than to wipe it up but such
considerations weighed not with our valiant leader

Mr Pyecroft he says it cant have escaped your notice that we
ave one angry and ighly intelligent army in front of us an another
ighly angry and equally intelligent army in our rear What ud you
recommend

Most men would have besought im to do a lateral glide while there was
yet time but all I said was The rockinghorse isnt expended
yet sir

He laid his hand on my shoulder Pye says he theres worse men
than you in loftier places They shall ave it None the less he
remarks the ice is undeniably packing

I may ave omitted to point out that at this juncture two large
armies both deprived of their nights sleep was awake as you might
say and hurryin into each others arms Here endeth the
second chapter

He filled his pipe slowly The uncle had fallen asleep Leggatt lit
another cigarette

We then proceeded ong automobile along the ridge in a westerly
direction towards the miniature fort which had been so kindly revealed
by the searchlight but which on inspection your Mr Leggatt bumped
into an outlyin reef of it proved to be a wurzelclump
cestdire a parallelogrammatic pile of about three million
mangoldwurzels brought up there for the sheep I suppose On all
sides excep the one wed come by the ground fell away moderately
quick and down at the bottom there was a large camp lit up an full of
harsh words of command

I said it was the key to the position Lootenant Morshed remarks
Trot out Persimmon which we rightly took to read Unwrap the
rockinghorse

Houp la says Jules in a insubordinate tone an slaps Persimmon on
the flank

Silence says the Lootenant This is the Royal Navy not Newmarket
and we carried Persimmon to the top of the mangelwurzel clump
as directed

Owing to the inequalities of the terrain I do think your Mr Leggatt
might have had a spiritlevel in his kit he wouldnt rock free on the
bedplate and while adjustin him his detachable tail fetched adrift
Our Lootenant was quick to seize the advantage

Remove that transformation he says Substitute one Roman candle
Gaspower is superior to manual propulsion

So we substituted He arranged the pice de resistarnce in the shape
of large drumsnot saucers mark youdrums of coloured fire with
printed instructions at proper distances round Persimmon There was a
brief interregnum while we dug ourselves in among the wurzels by hand
Then he touched off the fires not omitting the Roman candle and you
may take it from me all was visible Persimmon shone out in his naked
splendour red to port green to starboard and one white light at his
bows as per Board o Trade regulations Only he didnt so much rock
you might say as shrug himself in a manner of speaking every time the
candle went off One cant have everything But the rest surpassed our
highest expectations I think Persimmon was noblest on the starboard or
green sidemore like when a man thinks hes seeing mackerel in hell
dont you know And yet Id be the last to deprecate the effect of the
port light on his teeth or that bloodshot look in his left eye He
knew there was something going on he didnt approve of He
looked worried

Did you laugh I said

Im not much of a wag myself nor it wasnt as if we ad time to allow
the spectacle to sink in The coloured fires was supposed to burn ten
minutes whereas it was obvious to the meanest capacity that the Junior
Service would arrive by forced marches in about two and a half They
grarsped our topical allusion as soon as it was across the footlights
so to speak They were quite chafed at it Of course ad we reflected
we might have known that exposin illuminated rockinhorses to an army
that was learnin to ride on em partook of the nature of a double
entender as the French saysame as waggling the tiller lines at a man
whos had a hanging in the family I knew the cox of the
Archimandrites galley arf killed for a similar plaisanteree But
we never anticipated lobsters being so sensitive That was why we
shifted We could ardly tear our commandin officer away He put his
head on one side and kept cooin The only thing he ad neglected to
provide was a line of retreat but your Mr Leggattan eroic soul in
the last stage of wet prostrationhere took command of the van or
rather the rearguard We walked downhill beside him holding on to the
superstructure to prevent her capsizing These technical details
owever are beyond me He waved his pipe towards Leggatt

I saw there was two deepish ruts leadin down ill somewhere said
Leggatt That was when the soldiers stopped laughin and begun to
run uphill

Stroll lovey stroll Pyecroft corrected The Dervish rush took
place later

So I laid her in these ruts That was where she must ave scraped her
silencer a bit Then they turned sharp rightthe ruts didand then she
stopped bonnethigh in a manureheap sir but Ill swear it was all of
a one in three gradient I think it was a barnyard We waited there
said Leggatt

But not for long said Pyecroft The lights were towering out of the
drums on the position we ad so valiantly abandoned and the Junior
Service was escaladin it en masse When numerous bodies of ighly
trained men arrive simultaneous in the same latitude from opposite
directions each remarking briskly What the ell did you do that
for detonation as you might say is practically assured They didnt
ask for extraneous aids If wed come out with sworn affidavits of what
wed done they wouldnt ave believed us They wanted each others
company exclusive Such was the effect of Persimmon on their clarss
feelings Idoltry I call it Events transpired with the utmost
velocity and rapidly increasing pressures There was a few remarks about
Dicky Bridoon and mechanical horses and then some one was smackedhard
by the soundin the middle of a remark

That was the man who kept calling for the Fortyfifth Dragoons said
Leggatt He got as far as Drag 

Was it said Pyecroft dreamily Well he couldnt say they didnt
come They all came and they all fell to arguin whether the Infantry
should ave Persimmon for a regimental pet or the Cavalry should keep
him for stud purposes Hence the issue was soon clouded with
mangoldwurzels Our commander said we ad sowed the good seed and it
was bearing abundant fruit They weigh between four and seven pounds
apiece Seein the children ad got over their shyness and ad really
begun to play games we backed out o the pit and went down by steps
to the camp below no man as you might say making us afraid Here we
enjoyed a front view of the battle which rolled with renewed impetus
owing to both sides receiving strong reinforcements every minute All
arms were freely represented Cavalry on this occasion only acting in
concert with Artillery They argued the relative merits of horses
versus feet so to say but they didnt neglect Persimmon The wounded
rolling downhill with the wurzels informed us that he had long ago been
socialised and the smallest souvenirs were worth a mans life Speaking
broadly the Junior Service appeared to be a shade out of and if I may
venture so far They did not pay prompt and unhesitating obedience to
the Retires or the Cease Fires or the For Eavens sake come to
bed ducky of their officers who I regret to say were otly
embroiled at the heads of their respective units

How did you find that out I asked

On account of Lootenant Morshed going to the Mess tent to call on his
uncle and raise a drink but all hands had gone to the front We thought
we eard somebody bathing behind the tent and we found an oldish
gentleman tryin to drown a boy in knickerbockers in a horsetrough He
kept him under with a bicycle so to speak He ad nearly accomplished
his fell design when we frustrated him He was in a highly malleable
condition and full o juice de spree Arsk not what I am he says
My wife ll tell me that quite soon enough Arsk rather what Ive
been he says Ive been dinin here he says I commanded em in
the Eighties he says and Gawd forgive me he says sobbin
eavily Ive spent this holy evening telling their Colonel they was a
set of educated inefficients Hark to em We could without strainin
ourselves but how he picked up the gentle murmur of his own corps in
that ontheknee party up the hill I dont know Theyve marched and
fought thirty mile today he shouts and now theyre tearin the
intestines out of the Cavalry up yonder They wont stop this side the
gates o Delhi he says I commanded their ancestors Theres nothing
wrong with the Service he says wringing out his trousers on his lap
Eaven pardon me for doubtin em Same old gamesame young beggars

The boy in the knickerbockers languishing on a chair puts in a claim
for one drink Let him go dry says our friend in shirttails Hes a
reporter He run into me on his filthy bicycle and he asked me if I
could furnish im with particulars about the mutiny in the Army You
falseearted proletarian publicist he says shakin his finger at
imfor he was reelly annoyedIll teach you to defile what you cant
comprebend When my regiments in a state o mutiny Ill do myself the
honour of informing you personally You particularly ignorant and very
narsty little man he says youre no better than a dhobis donkey If
there wasnt dirty linen to wash youd starve he says and why I
havent drowned you will be the lastin regret of my life

Well we sat with em and ad drinks for about halfanhour in front
of the Mess tent Hed ha killed the reporter if there hadnt been
witnesses and the reporter might have taken notes of the battle so we
acted as twoway buffers in a sense I dont hold with the Press
mingling up with Service matters They draw false conclusions Now mark
you at a moderate estimate there were seven thousand men in the
fighting line half of em hurt in their professional feelings an the
other half rubbin in the liniment as you might say All due to
Persimmon If you adnt seen it you wouldnt ave believed it And yet
mark you not one single unit of em even resorted to his belt They
confined themselves to natural produckshands and the wurzels I
thought Jules was havin fits till it trarnspired the same thought had
impressed him in the French language He called it incroyable I
believe Seven thousand men with seven thousand rifles belts and
bayonets in a violently agitated condition and not a ungenteel blow
struck from first to last The old gentleman drew our attention to it as
well It was quite noticeable

Lack of ammunition was the primerry cause of the battle ceasin A
BrigadeMajor came in wipin his nose on both cuffs and sayin he ad
ad snuff The brigadieruncle followed He was so to speak sneezin
We thought it best to shift our moorings without attractin attention
so we shifted They ad called the cows ome by then The Junior Service
was going to byebye all round us as happy as the ships monkey when
hes been playin with the paints and Lootenant Morshed and Jules kept
bowin to port and starboard of the superstructure acknowledgin the
unstinted applause which the multitude would ave given em if theyd
known the facts On the other and as your Mr Leggatt observed they
might ave killed us

That would have been about five bells in the middle watch say
halfpast two A wellspent evening There was but little to be gained
by entering Portsmouth at that hour so we turned off on the grass this
was after we had found a road under us and we cast anchors out at the
stern and prayed for the day

But your Mr Leggatt he had to make and mend tyres all our watch below
It trarnspired she had been running on the rim o two or three wheels
which very properly he hadnt reported till the close of the action
And thats the reason of your four new tyres Mr Morshed was of opinion
youd earned em Do you dissent

I stretched out my hand which Pyecroft crushed to pulp No Pye I
said deeply moved I agree entirely But what happened to Jules

We returned him to his own Navy after breakfast He wouldnt have kept
much longer without some one in his own language to tell it to I dont
know any man I ever took more compassion on than Jules Is sufferings
swelled him up centimetres and all he could do on the Hard was to kiss
Lootenant Morshed and me and your Mr Leggatt He deserved that much
A cordial beggar

Pyecroft looked at the washed cups on the table and the low sunshine
on my cars back in the yard

Too early to drink to him he said But I feel it just the same

The uncle sunk in his chair snored a little the canary answered with
a shrill lullaby Pyecroft picked up the duster threw it over the cage
put his finger to his lips and we tiptoed out into the shop while
Leggatt brought the car round

Ill look out for the news in the papers I said as I got in

Oh we shortcircuited that Nothing trarnspired excep a statement to
the effect that some Territorial battalions had played about with
turnips at the conclusion of the manoeuvres The taxpayer dont know all
he gets for his money Farewell

We moved off just in time to be blocked by a regiment coming towards the
station to entrain for London

Beg your pardon sir said a sergeant in charge of the baggage but
would you mind backin a bit till we get the waggons past

Certainly I said You dont happen to have a rockinghorse among
your kit do you

The rattle of our reverse drowned his answer but I saw his eyes One of
them was blackishgreen about four days old




THE LEGEND OF MIRTH

     The Four Archangels so the legends tell
     Raphael Gabriel Michael Azrael
     Being first of those to whom the Power was shown
     Stood first of all the Host before The Throne
     And when the Charges were allotted burst
     Tumultuouswinged from out the assembly first
     Zeal was their spur that bade them strictly heed
     Their own high judgment on their lightest deed
     Zeal was their spur that when relief was given
     Urged them unwearied to fresh toil in Heaven
     For Honours sake perfecting every task
     Beyond what een Perfections self could ask
     And Allah Who created Zeal and Pride
     Knows how the twain are perilousnear allied

     It chanced on one of Heavens longlighted days
     The Four and all the Host having gone their ways
     Each to his Charge the shining Courts were void
     Save for one Seraph whom no charge employed
     With folden wings and slumberthreatened brow
     To whom The Word Beloved what dost thou
     By the Permission came the answer soft
     Little I do nor do that little oft
     As is The Will in Heaven so on Earth
     Where by The Will I strive to make men mirth
     He ceased and sped hearing The Word once more
     Beloved go thy way and greet the Four

     Systems and Universes overpast
     The Seraph came upon the Four at last
     Guiding and guarding with devoted mind
     The tedious generations of mankind
     Who lent at most unwilling ear and eye
     When they could not escape the ministry
     Yet patient faithful firm persistent just
     Toward all that gross indifferent facile dust
     The Archangels laboured to discharge their trust
     By precept and example prayer and law
     Advice reproof and rule but labouring saw
     Each in his fellows countenance confessed
     The Doubt that sickens Have I done my best

     Even as they sighed and turned to toil anew
     The Seraph hailed them with observance due
     And after some fit talk of higher things
     Touched tentative on mundane happenings
     This they permitting he emboldened thus
     Prolused of humankind promiscuous
     And since the large contention less avails
     Than instances observed he told them talesTales
     of the shop the bed the court the street
     Intimate elemental indiscreet
     Occasions where Confusion smiting swift
     Piles jest on jest as snowslides pile the drift

     Whence one by one beneath derisive skies
     The victims bare bewildered heads arise
     Tales of the passing of the spirit graced
     With humour blinding as the doom it faced
     Stark tales of ribaldry that broke aside
     To tears by laughter swallowed ere they dried
     Tales to which neither grace nor gain accrue
     But only Allah be exalted true
     And only as the Seraph showed that night
     Delighting to the limits of delight

     These he rehearsed with artful pause and halt
     And such pretence of memory at fault
     That soon the Fourso well the bait was thrown
     Came to his aid with memories of their own
     Matters dismissed long since as small or vain
     Whereof the high significance had lain
     Hid till the ungirt glosses made it plain
     Then as enlightenment came broad and fast
     Each marvelled at his own oblivious past
     Untilthe Gates of Laughter opened wide
     The Four with that bland Seraph at their side
     While they recalled compared and amplified
     In utter mirth forgot both zeal and pride

     High over Heaven the lamps of midnight burned
     Ere weak with merriment the Four returned
     Not in that order they were wont to keep
     Pinion to pinion answering sweep for sweep
     In awful diapason heard afar
     But shoutingly adrift twixt star and star
     Reeling a planets orbit left or right
     As laughter took them in the abysmal Night
     Or by the point of some remembered jest
     Winged and brought helpless down through gulfs unguessed
     Where the blank worlds that gather to the birth
     Leaped in the womb of Darkness at their mirth
     And een Gehennas bondsmen understood
     They were not damned from human brotherhood

     Not first nor last of Heavens high Host the Four
     That night took place beneath The Throne once more
     O lovelier than their morning majesty
     The understanding light behind the eye
     O more compelling than their old command
     The newlearned friendly gesture of the hand
     O sweeter than their zealous fellowship
     The wise halfsmile that passed from lip to lip
     O well and roundly when Command was given
     They told their tale against themselves to Heaven
     And in the silence waiting on The Word
     Received the Peace and Pardon of The Lord



My Sons Wife



He had suffered from the disease of the century since his early youth
and before he was thirty he was heavily marked with it He and a few
friends had rearranged Heaven very comfortably but the reorganisation
of Earth which they called Society was even greater fun It demanded
Work in the shape of many taxirides daily hours of brilliant talk with
brilliant talkers some sparkling correspondence a few silences but on
the understanding that their own turn should come soon while other
people expounded philosophies and a fair number of picturegalleries
teafights concerts theatres musichalls and cinema shows the whole
trimmed with lovemaking to women whose hair smelt of cigarettesmoke
Such strong days sent Frankwell Midmore back to his flat assured that he
and his friends had helped the World a step nearer the Truth the Dawn
and the New Order

His temperament he said led him more towards concrete data than
abstract ideas People who investigate detail are apt to be tired at the
days end The same temperament or it may have been a woman made him
early attach himself to the Immoderate Left of his Cause in the capacity
of an experimenter in Social Relations And since the Immoderate Left
contains plenty of women anxious to help earnest inquirers with large
independent incomes to arrive at evaluations of essentials Frankwell
Midmores lot was far from contemptible

At that hour Fate chose to play with him A widowed aunt widely
separated by nature and more widely by marriage from all that
Midmores mother had ever been or desired to be died and left him
possessions Mrs Midmore having that summer embraced a creed which
denied the existence of death naturally could not stoop to burial but
Midmore had to leave London for the dank country at a season when Social
Regeneration works best through long cushioned conferences two by two
after tea There he faced the bracing ritual of the British funeral and
was wept at across the raw grave by an elderly coffinshaped female with
a long nose who called him Master Frankie and there he was
congratulated behind an echoing tophat by a man he mistook for a mute
who turned out to be his aunts lawyer He wrote his mother next day
after a bright account of the funeral

So far as I can understand she has left me between four and five
hundred a year It all comes from Ther Land as they call it down here
The unspeakable attorney Sperrit and a greeneyed daughter who hums
to herself as she tramps but is silent on all subjects except huntin
insisted on taking me to see it Ther Land is brown and green in
alternate slabs like chocolate and pistachio cakes speckled with
occasional peasants who do not utter In case it should not be wet
enough there is a wet brook in the middle of it Ther House is by the
brook I shall look into it later If there should be any little memento
of Jenny that you care for let me know Didnt you tell me that
midVictorian furniture is coming into the market again Jennys old
maidit is called Rhoda Dolbietells me that Jenny promised it thirty
pounds a year The will does not Hence I suppose the tears at the
funeral But that is close on ten per cent of the income I fancy Jenny
has destroyed all her private papers and records of her vie intime
if indeed life be possible in such a place The Sperrit man told me
that if I had means of my own I might come and live on Ther Land I
didnt tell him how much I would pay not to I cannot think it right
that any human being should exercise mastery over others in the
merciless fashion our tomfool social system permits so as it is all
mine I intend to sell it whenever the unholy Sperrit can find a
purchaser

And he went to Mr Sperrit with the idea next day just before returning
to town

Quite so said the lawyer I see your point of course But the house
itself is rather oldfashionedhardly the type purchasers demand
nowadays Theres no park of course and the bulk of the land is let to
a lifetenant a Mr Sidney As long as he pays his rent he cant be
turned out and even if he didntMr Sperrits face relaxed a
shadeyou might have a difficulty

The property brings four hundred a year I understand said Midmore

Well hardlyhaardly Deducting land and income tax tithes fire
insurance cost of collection and repairs of course it returned two
hundred and eightyfour pounds last year The repairs are rather a large
itemowing to the brook I call it Lirisout of Horace you know

Midmore looked at his watch impatiently

I suppose you can find somebody to buy it he repeated

We will do our best of course if those are your instructions Then
that is all excepthere Midmore half rose but Mr Sperrits little
grey eyes held his large brown ones firmlyexcept about Rhoda Dolbie
Mrs Werfs maid I may tell you that we did not draw up your aunts
last will She grew secretive towards the lastelderly people often
doand had it done in London I expect her memory failed her or she
mislaid her notes She used to put them in her spectaclecase My
motor only takes eight minutes to get to the station Mr Midmore 
but as I was saying whenever she made her will with us Mrs Werf
always left Rhoda thirty pounds per annum Charlie the wills A clerk
with a baldish head and a long nose dealt documents on to the table like
cards and breathed heavily behind Midmore Its in no sense a legal
obligation of course said Mr Sperrit Ah that one is dated January
the th eighteen eightynine

Midmore looked at his watch again and found himself saying with no good
grace Well I suppose shed better have itfor the present at
any rate

He escaped with an uneasy feeling that two hundred and fiftyfour pounds
a year was not exactly four hundred and that Charlies long nose
annoyed him Then he returned firstclass to his own affairs

Of the two perhaps three experiments in Social Relations which he had
then in hand one interested him acutely It had run for some months and
promised most variegated and interesting developments on which he dwelt
luxuriously all the way to town When he reached his flat he was not
well prepared for a twelvepage letter explaining in the diction of the
Immoderate Left which rubricates its Is and illuminates its Ts that
the lady had realised greater attractions in another Soul She
restated rather than pleaded the gospel of the Immoderate Left as her
justification and ended in an impassioned demand for her right to
express herself in and on her own life through which she pointed out
she could pass but once She added that if later she should discover
Midmore was essentially complementary to her needs she would tell him
so That Midmore had himself written much the same sort of
epistlebarring the hint of returnto a woman of whom his needs for
selfexpression had caused him to weary three years before did not
assist him in the least He expressed himself to the gasfire in terms
essential but not complimentary Then he reflected on the detached
criticism of his best friends and her best friends male and female
with whom he and she and others had talked so openly while their gay
adventure was in flower He recalled toothis must have been about
midnighther analysis from every angle remote and most intimate of
the mate to whom she had been adjudged under the base convention which
is styled marriage Later at that bad hour when the cattle wake for a
little he remembered her in other aspects and went down into the hell
appointed desolate desiring with no God to call upon About eleven
oclock next morning Eliphaz the Temanite Bildad the Shuhite and
Zophar the Naamathite called upon him for they had made appointment
together to see how he took it but the janitor told them that Job had
goneinto the country he believed

Midmores relief when he found his story was not written across his
aching temples for Mr Sperrit to readthe defeated lover like the
successful one believes all earth privy to his soulwas put down by
Mr Sperrit to quite different causes He led him into a morningroom
The rest of the house seemed to be full of people singing to a loud
piano idiotic songs about cows and the hall smelt of damp cloaks

Its our evening to take the winter cantata Mr Sperrit explained
Its High Tide on the Coast of Lincolnshire I hoped youd come back
There are scores of little things to settle As for the house of
course it stands ready for you at any time I couldnt get Rhoda out of
itnor could Charlie for that matter Shes the sister isnt she of
the nurse who brought you down here when you were four she says to
recover from measles

Is she Was I said Midmore through the bad tastes in his mouth
Dyou suppose I could stay there the night

Thirty joyous young voices shouted appeal to some one to leave their
pipes of parsley ollowollowollow Mr Sperrit had to raise his
voice above the din

Well if I asked you to stay here I should never hear the last of it
from Rhoda Shes a little cracked of course but the soul of devotion
and capable of anything Ne sit ancillae you know

Thank you Then Ill go Ill walk He stumbled out dazed and sick
into the winter twilight and sought the square house by the brook

It was not a dignified entry because when the door was unchained and
Rhoda exclaimed he took two valiant steps into the hall and then
faintedas men sometimes will after twentytwo hours of strong emotion
and little food

Im sorry he said when he could speak He was lying at the foot of
the stairs his head on Rhodas lap

Your ome is your castle sir was the reply in his hair I smelt it
wasnt drink You lay on the sofa till I get your supper

She settled him in a drawingroom hung with yellow silk heavy with the
smell of dead leaves and oil lamp Something murmured soothingly in the
background and overcame the noises in his head He thought he heard
horses feet on wet gravel and a voice singing about ships and flocks
and grass It passed close to the shuttered baywindow

     But each will mourn his own she saith
     And sweeter woman neer drew breath
     Than my sons wife Elizabeth 
     Cushacushacushacalling

The hoofs broke into a canter as Rhoda entered with the tray And then
Ill put you to bed she said Sidneys coming in the morning
Midmore asked no questions He dragged his poor bruised soul to bed and
would have pitied it all over again but the food and warm sherry and
water drugged him to instant sleep

Rhodas voice wakened him asking whether he would have ip foot or
sitz which he understood were the baths of the establishment Suppose
you try all three she suggested Theyre all yours you know sir

He would have renewed his sorrows with the daylight but her words
struck him pleasantly Everything his eyes opened upon was his very own
to keep for ever The carved fourpost Chippendale bed obviously worth
hundreds the wavy walnut William and Mary chairshe had seen worse
ones labelled twenty guineas apiece the oval medallion mirror the
delicate eighteenthcentury wire fireguard the heavy brocaded curtains
were hisall his So too a great garden full of birds that faced him
when he shaved a mulberry tree a sundial and a dull steelcoloured
brook that murmured level with the edge of a lawn a hundred yards away
Peculiarly and privately his own was the smell of sausages and coffee
that he sniffed at the head of the wide square landing all set round
with mysterious doors and Bartolozzi prints He spent two hours after
breakfast in exploring his new possessions His heart leaped up at such
things as sewingmachines a rubbertyred bathchair in a tiled passage
a malachiteheaded Malacca cane boxes and boxes of unopened stationery
sealrings bunches of keys and at the bottom of a steelnet reticule a
little leather purse with seven pounds ten shillings in gold and eleven
shillings in silver

You used to play with that when my sister brought you down here after
your measles said Rhoda as he slipped the money into his pocket Now
this was your pore dear aunties businessroom She opened a low door
Oh I forgot about Mr Sidney There he is An enormous old man with
rheumy red eyes that blinked under downy white eyebrows sat in an Empire
chair his cap in his hands Rhoda withdrew sniffing The man looked
Midmore over in silence then jerked a thumb towards the door I reckon
she told you who I be he began Im the only farmer youve got
Nothin goes off my place thout it walks on its own feet What about my
pigpound

Well what about it said Midmore

Thats just what I be come about The County Councils are getting more
particular Did ye know there was swine fever at Pashells There be
Itll ave to be in brick

Yes said Midmore politely

Ive bin at your aunt that was plenty times about it I dont say she
wasnt a just woman but she didnt read the lease same way I did I be
used to bein put upon but theres no doing any longer thout that
pigpound

When would you like it Midmore asked It seemed the easiest road to
take

Any time or other suits me I reckon He aint thrivin where he is
an I paid eighteen shillin for him He crossed his hands on his stick
and gave no further sign of life

Is that all Midmore stammered

All nowexcephe glanced fretfully at the table beside himexcep
my usuals Wheres that Rhoda

Midmore rang the bell Rhoda came in with a bottle and a glass The old
man helped himself to four stiff fingers rose in one piece and stumped
out At the door he cried ferociously Dont suppose its any odds to
you whether Im drowned or not but them floodgates want a wheel and
winch they do I be too old for liftin em with the barmy time
o life

Good riddance if e was drowned said Rhoda But dont you mind him
Hes only amusin himself Your pore dear auntie used to give im is
usualtisnt the whisky you drinkan send im about is business

I see Now is a pigpound the same thing as a pigsty

Rhoda nodded E needs one too but e aint entitled to it You look
at is leasethird drawer on the left in that Bombay cabnetan next
time e comes you ask im to read it Thatll choke im off because
e cant

There was nothing in Midmores past to teach him the message and
significance of a handwritten lease of the late eighties but Rhoda
interpreted

It dont mean anything reelly was her cheerful conclusion excep
you mustnt get rid of him anyhow an e can do what e likes always
Lucky for us e do farm and if it wasnt for is woman

Oh theres a Mrs Sidney is there

Lor no The Sidneys dont marry They keep Thats his fourth
sinceto my knowledge He was a takin man from the first

Any families

Theyd be grown up by now if there was wouldnt they But you cant
spend all your days considerin is interests Thats what gave your
pore aunt er indigestion Ave you seen the gunroom

Midmore held strong views on the immorality of taking life for pleasure
But there was no denying that the late Colonel Werfs seventyguinea
breechloaders were good at their filthy job He loaded one took it out
and pointedmerely pointedit at a cockpheasant which rose out of a
shrubbery behind the kitchen and the flaming bird came down in a long
slant on the lawn stone dead Rhoda from the scullery said it was a
lovely shot and told him lunch was ready

He spent the afternoon gun in one hand a map in the other beating the
bounds of his lands They lay altogether in a shallow uninteresting
valley flanked with woods and bisected by a brook Up stream was his
own house down stream less than half a mile a low red farmhouse
squatted in an old orchard beside what looked like small lockgates on
the Thames There was no doubt as to ownership Mr Sidney saw him while
yet far off and bellowed at him about pigpounds and floodgates These
last were two great sliding shutters of weedy oak across the brook
which were prised up inch by inch with a crowbar along a notched strip
of iron and when Sidney opened them they at once let out half the
water Midmore watched it shrink between its aldered banks like some
conjuring trick This too was his very own

I see he said How interesting Now whats that bell for he went
on pointing to an old ships bell in a rude belfry at the end of an
outhouse Was that a chapel once The redeyed giant seemed to have
difficulty in expressing himself for the moment and blinked savagely

Yes he said at last My chapel When you ear that bell ring youll
ear something Nobody but me ud put up with itbut I reckon it dont
make any odds to you He slammed the gates down again and the brook
rose behind them with a suck and a grunt

Midmore moved off conscious that he might be safer with Rhoda to hold
his conversational hand As he passed the front of the farmhouse a
smooth fat woman with neatly parted grey hair under a widows cap
curtsied to him deferentially through the window By every teaching of
the Immoderate Left she had a perfect right to express herself in any
way she pleased but the curtsey revolted him And on his way home he
was hailed from behind a hedge by a manifest idiot with no roof to his
mouth who hallooed and danced round him

What did that beast want he demanded of Rhoda at tea

Jimmy He only wanted to know if you ad any telegrams to send Ell
go anywhere so long as tisnt across running water That gives im is
seizures Even talkin about it for fun like makes im shake

But why isnt he where he can be properly looked after

What arms e doing Es a lovechild but is family can pay for im
If e was locked up ed die all off at once like a wild rabbit Wont
you please look at the drive sir

Midmore looked in the fading light The neat gravel was pitted with
large roundish holes and there was a punch or two of the same sort
on the lawn

Thats the unt comin ome Rhoda explained Your pore dear auntie
always let em use our drive for a short cut after the Colonel died The
Colonel wouldnt so much because he preserved but your auntie was
always an orsewoman till er sciatica

Isnt there some one who can rake it over oror something said
Midmore vaguely

Oh yes Youll never see it in the morning butyou was out when they
came ome an Mister Fisherhes the Mastertold me to tell you with
is compliments that if you wasnt preservin and cared to old to the
old understanding is gravelpit is at your service same as before E
thought perhaps you mightnt know and it ad slipped my mind to tell
you Its good gravel Mister Fishers and it binds beautiful on the
drive We ave to draw it o course from the pit but

Midmore looked at her helplessly

Rhoda said he what am I supposed to do

Oh let em come through she replied You never know You may want
to unt yourself some day

That evening it rained and his misery returned on him the worse for
having been diverted At last he was driven to paw over a few score
books in a panelled room called the library and realised with horror
what the late Colonel Werfs mind must have been in its prime The
volumes smelt of a dead world as strongly as they did of mildew He
opened and thrust them back one after another till crude coloured
illustrations of men on horses held his eye He began at random and read
a little moved into the drawingroom with the volume and settled down
by the fire still reading It was a foul world into which he peeped for
the first timea heavyeating harddrinking hell of horsecopers
swindlers matchmaking mothers economically dependent virgins selling
themselves blushingly for cash and lands Jews tradesmen and an
illconsidered spawn of Dickensandhorsedung characters I give
Midmores own criticism but he read on fascinated and behold from
the pages leaped as it were the brother to the redeyed man of the
brook bellowing at a landlord here Midmore realised that he was that
very animal for new barns and another man who like himself again
objected to hoofmarks on gravel Outrageous as thought and conception
were the stuff seemed to have the rudiments of observation He dug out
other volumes by the same author till Rhoda came in with a silver
candlestick

Rhoda said he did you ever hear about a character called James
Piggand Batsey

Why o course said she The Colonel used to come into the kitchen
in is dressingown an read us all those Jorrockses

Oh Lord said Midmore and went to bed with a book called Handley
Cross under his arm and a lonelier Columbus into a stranger world the
wetringed moon never looked upon

                                   

Here we omit much But Midmore never denied that for the epicure in
sensation the urgent needs of an ancient house as interpreted by Rhoda
pointing to daylight through attictiles held in place by moss gives an
edge to the pleasure of Social Research elsewhere Equally he found that
the reaction following prolonged research loses much of its grey terror
if one knows one can at will bathe the soul in the society of plumbers
all the waterpipes had chronic appendicitis village idiots Jimmy
had taken Midmore under his weak wing and camped daily at the
drivegates and a giant with red eyelids whose every action is an
unpredictable outrage

Towards spring Midmore filled his house with a few friends of the
Immoderate Left It happened to be the day when all things and Rhoda
working together a cartload of bricks another of sand and some bags
of lime had been despatched to build Sidney his almost dailydemanded
pigpound Midmore took his friends across the flat fields with some
idea of showing them Sidney as a type of the peasantry They hit the
minute when Sidney hoarse with rage was ordering bricklayer mate
carts and all off his premises The visitors disposed themselves
to listen

You never give me no notice about changin the pig Sidney shouted
The pigat least eighteen inches longreared on end in the old sty and
smiled at the company

But my good man Midmore opened

I aint For aught you know I be a dam sight worse than you be You
cant come and beave arbitry with me You are beavin arbitry All
you men go clean away an dont set foot on my land till I bid ye

But you askedMidmore felt his voice jump upto have the pigpound
built

Spose I did Thats no reason you shouldnt send me notice to change
the pig Comin down on me like this thout warnin That pigs got to
be got into the cowshed an all

Then open the door and let him run in said Midmore

Dont you beave arbitry with me Take all your dam men ome off my
land I wont be treated arbitry

The carts moved off without a word and Sidney went into the house and
slammed the door

Now I hold that is enormously significant said a visitor Here you
have the logical outcome of centuries of feudal oppressionthe frenzy
of fear The company looked at Midmore with grave pain

But he did worry my life out about his pigsty was all Midmore
found to say

Others took up the parable and proved to him if he only held true to the
gospels of the Immoderate Left the earth would soon be covered with
jolly little pigsties built in the intervals of morrisdancing by
the peasant himself

Midmore felt grateful when the door opened again and Mr Sidney invited
them all to retire to the road which he pointed out was public As
they turned the corner of the house a smoothfaced woman in a widows
cap curtsied to each of them through the window

Instantly they drew pictures of that womans lot deprived of all
vehicle for selfexpressionthe set grey life and apathetic end one
quotedand they discussed the tremendous significance of village
theatricals Even a month ago Midmore would have told them all that he
knew and Rhoda had dropped about Sidneys forms of selfexpression Now
for some strange reason he was content to let the talk run on from
village to metropolitan and world drama

Rhoda advised him after the visitors left that if he wanted to do that
again he had better go up to town

But we only sat on cushions on the floor said her master

Theyre too old for romps she retorted an its only the beginning
of things Ive seen what Ive seen Besides they talked and laughed
in the passage going to their bathssuch as took em

Dont be a fool Rhoda said Midmore No manunless he has loved
herwill casually dismiss a woman on whose lap he has laid his head

Very good she snorted but that cuts both ways An now you go down
to Sidneys this evenin and put him where he ought to be He was in his
right about you givin im notice about changin the pig but he adnt
any right to turn it up before your company No manners no pigpound
Hell understand

Midmore did his best to make him He found himself reviling the old man
in speech and with a joy quite new in all his experience He wound
upit was a plagiarism from a plumberby telling Mr Sidney that he
looked like a turkeycock had the morals of a parish bull and need
never hope for a new pigpound as long as he or Midmore lived

Very good said the giant I reckon you thought you ad something
against me and now youve come down an told it me like man to man
Quite right I dont bear malice Now you send along those bricks an
sand an Ill make a do to build the pigpound myself If you look at
my lease youll find out youre bound to provide me materials for the
repairs Onlyonly I thought thered be no arm in my askin you to do
it throughout like

Midmore fairly gasped Then why the devil did you turn my carts back
whenwhen I sent them up here to do it throughout for you

Mr Sidney sat down on the floodgates his eyebrows knitted in thought

Ill tell you he said slowly Twas too dam like cheatin a suckin
baby My woman she said so too

For a few seconds the teachings of the Immoderate Left whose humour is
all their own wrestled with those of Mother Earth who has her own
humours Then Midmore laughed till he could scarcely stand In due time
Mr Sidney laughed toocrowing and wheezing crescendo till it broke
from him in roars They shook hands and Midmore went home grateful that
he had held his tongue among his companions

When he reached his house he met three or four men and women on
horseback very muddy indeed coming down the drive Feeling hungry
himself he asked them if they were hungry They said they were and he
bade them enter Jimmy took their horses who seemed to know him Rhoda
took their battered hats led the women upstairs for hairpins and
presently fed them all with teacakes poached eggs anchovy toast and
drinks from a coromandelwood liqueur case which Midmore had never known
that he possessed

And I will say said Miss Connie Sperrit her spurred foot on the
fender and a smoking muffin in her whip hand Rhoda does one tophole
She always did since I was eight

Seven Miss was when you began to unt said Rhoda setting down more
buttered toast

And so the MFH was saying to Midmore when he got to your brute
Sidneys land we had to whip em off Its a regular Alsatia for em
They know it Whyhe dropped his voiceI dont want to say anything
against Sidney as your tenant of course but I do believe the old
scoundrels perfectly capable of putting down poison

Sidneys capable of anything said Midmore with immense feeling but
once again he held his tongue They were a queer community yet when
they had stamped and jingled out to their horses again the house felt
hugely big and disconcerting

This may be reckoned the conscious beginning of his double life It ran
in odd channels that summera riding school for instance near Hayes
Common and a shooting ground near Wormwood Scrubs A man who has been
saddlegalled or shoulderbruised for half the day is not at his London
best of evenings and when the bills for his amusements come in he
curtails his expenses in other directions So a cloud settled on
Midmores name His London world talked of a hardening of heart and a
tightening of pursestrings which signified disloyalty to the Cause One
man a confidant of the old expressive days attacked him robustiously
and demanded account of his souls progress It was not furnished for
Midmore was calculating how much it would cost to repave stables so
dilapidated that even the village idiot apologised for putting visitors
horses into them The man went away and served up what he had heard of
the pigpound episode as a little newspaper sketch calculated to annoy
Midmore read it with an eye as practical as a womans and since most of
his experiences had been among women at once sought out a woman to whom
he might tell his sorrow at the disloyalty of his own familiar friend
She was so sympathetic that he went on to confide how his bruised
heartshe knew all about ithad found solace with a long O in
another quarter which he indicated rather carefully in case it might be
betrayed to other loyal friends As his hints pointed directly towards
facile Hampstead and as his urgent business was the purchase of a horse
from a dealer Beckenham way he felt he had done good work Later when
his friend the scribe talked to him alluringly of secret gardens and
those solaces to which every man who follows the Wider Morality is
entitled Midmore lent him a fivepound note which he had got back on
the price of a ninetyguinea bay gelding So true it is as he read in
one of the late Colonel Werfs books that the young man of the present
day would sooner lie under an imputation against his morals than against
his knowledge of horseflesh

Midmore desired more than he desired anything else at that moment to
ride and above all to jump on a ninetyguinea bay gelding with black
points and a slovenly habit of hitting his fences He did not wish many
people except Mr Sidney who very kindly lent his soft meadow behind
the floodgates to be privy to the matter which he rightly foresaw
would take him to the autumn So he told such friends as hinted at
country weekend visits that he had practically let his newly inherited
house The rent he said was an object to him for he had lately lost
large sums through illconsidered benevolences He would name no names
but they could guess And they guessed loyally all round the circle of
his acquaintance as they spread the news that explained so much

There remained only one couple of his once intimate associates to
pacify They were deeply sympathetic and utterly loyal of course but
as curious as any of the apes whose diet they had adopted Midmore met
them in a suburban train coming up to town not twenty minutes after he
had come off two hours advanced tuition one guinea an hour over
hurdles in a hall He had of course changed his kit but his too heavy
bridlehand shook a little among the newspapers On the inspiration of
the moment which is your natural liars best hold he told them that he
was condemned to a restcure He would lie in semidarkness drinking
milk for weeks and weeks cut off even from letters He was astonished
and delighted at the ease with which the usual lie confounds the unusual
intellect They swallowed it as swiftly as they recommended him to live
on nuts and fruit but he saw in the womans eyes the exact reason she
would set forth for his retirement After all she had as much right to
express herself as he purposed to take for himself and Midmore believed
strongly in the fullest equality of the sexes

That retirement made one small ripple in the strenuous world The lady
who had written the twelvepage letter ten months before sent him
another of eight pages analysing all the motives that were leading her
back to himshould she comenow that he was ill and alone Much might
yet be retrieved she said out of the waste of jarring lives and
piteous misunderstandings It needed only a hand

But Midmore needed two next morning very early for a devils
diversion among wet coppices called cubbing

You havent a bad seat said Miss Sperrit through the morningmists
But youre worrying him

He pulls so Midmore grunted

Let him alone then Look out for the branches she shouted as they
whirled up a splashy ride Cubs were plentiful Most of the hounds
attached themselves to a straightnecked youngster of education who
scuttled out of the woods into the open fields below

Hold on some one shouted Turn em Midmore Thats your brute
Sidneys land Its all wire

Oh Connie stop Mrs Sperrit shrieked as her daughter charged at a
boundaryhedge

Wire be damned I had it all out a fortnight ago Come on This was
Midmore buffeting into it a little lower down

I knew that Connie cried over her shoulder and she flitted across
the open pasture humming to herself

Oh of course If some people have private information they can afford
to thrust This was a snuffcoloured habit into which Miss Sperrit had
cannoned down the ride

What Midmore got Sidney to heel You never did that Sperrit This
was Mr Fisher MFH enlarging the breach Midmore had made

No confound him said the father testily Go on sir Injecto ter
pulvereyouve kicked half the ditch into my eye already

They killed that cub a little short of the haven his mother had told him
to make fora twoacre Alsatia of a gorsepatch to which the MFH had
been denied access for the last fifteen seasons He expressed his
gratitude before all the field and Mr Sidney at Mr Sidneys
farmhouse door

And if there should be any poultry claims he went on

There wont be said Midmore Its too like cheating a sucking child
isnt it Mr Sidney

Youve got me was all the reply I be used to bein put upon but
youve got me Mus Midmore

Midmore pointed to a new brick pigpound built in strict disregard of
the terms of the lifetenants lease The gesture told the tale to the
few who did not know and they shouted

Such pagan delights as these were followed by pagan sloth of evenings
when men and women elsewhere are at their brightest But Midmore
preferred to lie out on a yellow silk couch reading works of a debasing
vulgarity or by invitation to dine with the Sperrits and savages of
their kidney These did not expect flights of fancy or phrasing They
lied except about horses grudgingly and of necessity not for arts
sake and men and women alike they expressed themselves along their
chosen lines with the serene indifference of the larger animals Then
Midmore would go home and identify them one by one out of the
naturalhistory books by Mr Surtees on the table beside the sofa At
first they looked upon him coolly but when the tale of the removed wire
and the recaptured gorse had gone the rounds they accepted him for a
person willing to play their games True a faction suspended judgment
for a while because they shot and hoped that Midmore would serve the
glorious mammon of pheasantraising rather than the unkempt god of
foxhunting But after he had shown his choice they did not ask by what
intellectual process he had arrived at it He hunted three sometimes
four times a week which necessitated not only one bay gelding 
s but a mannerly whitestockinged chestnut  and a black
mare rather long in the back but with a mouth of silk  who so
evidently preferred to carry a lady that it would have been cruel to
have baulked her Besides with that handling she could be sold at a
profit And besides the hunt was a quiet intimate kindly little hunt
not anxious for strangers of good report in the Field the servant of
one MFH given to hospitality riding well its own horses and with
the exception of Midmore not novices But as Miss Sperrit observed
after the MFH had said some things to him at a gate It is a pity
you dont know as much as your horse but you will in time It takes
years and yeears Ive been at it for fifteen and Im only just
learning But youve made a decent kickoff

So he kicked off in wind and wet and mud wondering quite sincerely why
the bubbling ditches and sucking pastures held him from day to day or
what solace he could find on off days in chasing grooms and
bricklayers round outhouses

To make sure he uprooted himself one weekend of heavy midwinter rain
and reentered his lost world in the character of Galahad fresh from a
restcure They all agreed with an eye over his shoulder for the next
comer that he was a different man but when they asked him for the
symptoms of nervous strain and led him all through their own he
realised he had lost much of his old skill in lying His three months
absence too had put him hopelessly behind the London field The
movements the allusions the slang of the game had changed The couples
had rearranged themselves or were recrystallizing in fresh triangles
whereby he put his foot in it badly Only one great soul he who had
written the account of the pigpound episode stood untouched by the
vast flux of time and Midmore lent him another fiver for his integrity
A woman took him in the wet forenoon to a pronouncement on the Oneness
of Impulse in Humanity which struck him as a polysyllabic rsum of
Mr Sidneys domestic arrangements plus a clarion call to shock
civilisation into commonsense

And youll come to tea with me tomorrow she asked after lunch
nibbling cashew nuts from a saucer Midmore replied that there were
great arrears of work to overtake when a man had been put away for
so long

But youve come back like a giant refreshed I hope that
Daphnethis was the lady of the twelve and the eightpage
letterwill be with us too She has misunderstood herself like so
many of us the woman murmured but I think eventually  she flung
out her thin little hands However these are things that each lonely
soul must adjust for itself

Indeed yes said Midmore with a deep sigh The old tricks were
sprouting in the old atmosphere like mushrooms in a dungpit He passed
into an abrupt reverie shook his head as though stung by tumultuous
memories and departed without any ceremony of farewell tocatch a
midafternoon express where a man meets associates who talk horse and
weather as it affects the horse all the way down What worried him most
was that he had missed a day with the hounds

He met Rhodas keen old eyes without flinching and the drawingroom
looked very comfortable that wet evening at tea After all his visit to
town had not been wholly a failure He had burned quite a bushel of
letters at his flat A flathere he reached mechanically towards the
worn volumes near the sofaa flat was a consuming animal As for
Daphne  he opened at random on the words His lordship then did as
desired and disclosed a tableau of considerable strength and variety
Midmore reflected And I used to think But she wasnt We were
all babblers and skirters together I didnt babble muchthank
goodnessbut I skirted He turned the pages backward for more Sortes
Surteesianae and read When at length they rose to go to bed it
struck each man as he followed his neighbour upstairs that the man
before him walked very crookedly He laughed aloud at the fire

What about tomorrow Rhoda asked entering with garments over her
shoulder Its never stopped raining since you left Youll be
plastered out of sight an all in five minutes Youd better wear your
next best adnt you Im afraid theyve shrank Adnt you best
try em on

Here said Midmore

Suit yourself I bathed you when you wasnt larger than a leg o
lamb said the exladiesmaid

Rhoda one of these days I shall get a valet and a married butler

Theres many a true word spoke in jest But nobodys huntin
tomorrow

Why Have they cancelled the meet

They say it only means slipping and overreaching in the mud and they
all ad enough of that today Charlie told me so just now

Oh It seemed that the word of Mr Sperrits confidential clerk had
weight

Charlie came down to help Mr Sidney lift the gates Rhoda continued

The floodgates They are perfectly easy to handle now Ive put in a
wheel and a winch

When the brooks really up they must be took clean out on account of
the rubbish blockin em Thats why Charlie came down

Midmore grunted impatiently Everybody has talked to me about that
brook ever since I came here Its never done anything yet

This as been a dry summer If you care to look now sir Ill get you
a lantern

She paddled out with him into a large wet night Halfway down the lawn
her light was reflected on shallow brown water pricked through with
grass blades at the edges Beyond that light the brook was strangling
and kicking among hedges and treetrunks

What on earth will happen to the big rosebed was Midmores first
word

It generally as to be restocked after a flood Ah she raised her
lantern Theres two gardenseats knockin against the sundial Now
that wont do the roses any good

This is too absurd There ought to be some decently thoughtout
systemforfor dealing with this sort of thing He peered into the
rushing gloom There seemed to be no end to the moisture and the racket
In town he had noticed nothing

It cant be elped said Rhoda Its just what it does do once in
just so often Wed better go back

All earth under foot was sliding in a thousand liquid noises towards
the hoarse brook Somebody wailed from the house Fraid o the water
Come ere Fraid o the water

Thats Jimmy Wet always takes im that way she explained The idiot
charged into them shaking with terror

Brave Jimmy How brave of Jimmy Come into the hall What Jimmy got
now she crooned It was a sodden note which ran Dear RhodaMr
Lotten with whom I rode home this afternoon told me that if this wet
keeps up hes afraid the fishpond he built last year where Coxens
old milldam was will go as the dam did once before he says If it
does its bound to come down the brook It may be all right but perhaps
you had better look out CS

If Coxens dam goes that means Ill ave the drawingroom carpet
up at once to be on the safe side The clawammer is in the libery

Wait a minute Sidneys gates are out you said

Both Hell need it if Coxens pond goes Ive seen it once

Ill just slip down and have a look at Sidney Light the lantern again
please Rhoda

You wont get him to stir Hes been there since he was born But
she dont know anything Ill fetch your waterproof and some
topboots

Fraid o the water Fraid o the water Jimmy sobbed pressed
against a corner of the hall his hands to his eyes

All right Jimmy Jimmy can help play with the carpet Rhoda
answered as Midmore went forth into the darkness and the roarings all
round He had never seen such an utterly unregulated state of affairs
There was another lantern reflected on the streaming drive

Hi Rhoda Did you get my note I came down to make sure I thought
afterwards Jimmy might funk the water

Its meMiss Sperrit Midmore cried Yes we got it thanks

Youre back then Oh good Is it bad down with you

Im going to Sidneys to have a look

You wont get him out Lucky I met Bob Lotten I told him he hadnt
any business impounding water for his idiotic trout without
rebuilding the dam

How far up is it Ive only been there once

Not more than four miles as the water will come He says hes opened
all the sluices

She had turned and fallen into step beside him her hooded head bowed
against the thinning rain As usual she was humming to herself

Why on earth did you come out in this weather Midmore asked

It was worse when you were in town The rains taking off now If it
wasnt for that pond I wouldnt worry so much Theres Sidneys bell
Come on She broke into a run A cracked bell was jangling feebly down
the valley

Keep on the road Midmore shouted The ditches were snorting
bankfull on either side and towards the brookside the fields were
afloat and beginning to move in the darkness

Catch me going off it Theres his light burning all right She halted
undistressed at a little rise But the floods in the orchard Look
She swung her lantern to show a front rank of old appletrees reflected
in still outlying waters beyond the halfdrowned hedge They could
hear above the thudthud of the gorged floodgates shrieks in two keys
as monotonous as a steamorgan

The high ones the pig Miss Sperrit laughed

All right Ill get her out You stay where you are and Ill see you
home afterwards

But the waters only just over the road she objected

Never mind Dont you move Promise

All right You take my stick then and feel for holes in case
anythings washed out anywhere This is a lark

Midmore took it and stepped into the water that moved sluggishly as yet
across the farm road which ran to Sidneys front door from the raised
and metalled public road It was half way up to his knees when he
knocked As he looked back Miss Sperrits lantern seemed to float in
midocean

You cant come in or the waterll come with you Ive bunged up all the
cracks Mr Sidney shouted from within Who be ye

Take me out Take me out the woman shrieked and the pig from his
sty behind the house urgently seconded the motion

Im Midmore Coxens old milldam is likely to go they say Come out

I told em it would when they made a fishpond of it Twasnt ever
puddled proper But its a middlin wide valley Shes got room to
spread Keep still or Ill take and duck you in the cellar You
go ome Mus Midmore an take the law o Mus Lotten soons youve
changed your socks

Confound you arent you coming out

To catch my death o cold Im all right where I be Ive seen it
before But you can take her Shes no sort o use or sense Climb
out through the window Didnt I tell you Id plugged the doorcracks
you fools daughter The parlour window opened and the woman flung
herself into Midmores arms nearly knocking him down Mr Sidney leaned
out of the window pipe in mouth

Take her ome he said and added oracularly

     Two women in one house
     Two cats an one mouse
     Two dogs an one bone
     Which I will leave alone

Ive seen it before Then he shut and fastened the window

A trap A trap You had ought to have brought a trap for me Ill be
drowned in this wet the woman cried

Hold up You cant be any wetter than you are Come along Midmore
did not at all like the feel of the water over his boottops

Hooray Come along Miss Sperrits lantern not fifty yards away
waved cheerily

The woman threshed towards it like a panicstricken goose fell on her
knees was jerked up again by Midmore and pushed on till she collapsed
at Miss Sperrits feet

But you wont get bronchitis if you go straight to Mr Midmores
house said the unsympathetic maiden

O Gawd O Gawd I wish our eavenly Father ud forgive me my sins an
call me ome the woman sobbed But I wont go to is ouse
I wont

All right then Stay here Now if we run Miss Sperrit whispered to
Midmore shell follow us Not too fast

They set off at a considerable trot and the woman lumbered behind them
bellowing till they met a third lanternRhoda holding Jimmys hand
She had got the carpet up she said and was escorting Jimmy past the
water that he dreaded

Thats all right Miss Sperrit pronounced Take Mrs Sidney back with
you Rhoda and put her to bed Ill take Jimmy with me You arent
afraid of the water now are you Jimmy

Not afraid of anything now Jimmy reached for her hand But get away
from the water quick

Im coming with you Midmore interrupted

You most certainly are not Youre drenched She threw you twice Go
home and change You may have to be out again all night Its only
halfpast seven now Im perfectly safe She flung herself lightly over
a stile and hurried uphill by the footpath out of reach of all but
the boasts of the flood below

Rhoda dead silent herded Mrs Sidney to the house

Youll find your things laid out on the bed she said to Midmore as he
came up Ill attend toto this Shes got nothing to cry for

Midmore raced into dry kit and raced uphill to be rewarded by the sight
of the lantern just turning into the Sperrits gate He came back by way
of Sidneys farm where he saw the light twinkling across three acres of
shining water for the rain had ceased and the clouds were stripping
overhead though the brook was noisier than ever Now there was only
that doubtful millpond to look afterthat and his swirling world
abandoned to himself alone

We shall have to sit up for it said Rhoda after dinner And as the
drawingroom commanded the best view of the rising flood they watched
it from there for a long time while all the clocks of the house bore
them company

Tisnt the water its the mud on the skirtingboard after it goes
down that I mind Rhoda whispered The last time Coxens mill broke I
remember it came up to the secondno thirdstep o Mr
Sidneys stairs

What did Sidney do about it

He made a notch on the step E said it was a record Just like im

Its up to the drive now said Midmore after another long wait And
the rain stopped before eight you know

Then Coxens dam as broke and thats the first of the floodwater
She stared out beside him The water was rising in sudden pulsesan
inch or two at a time with great sweeps and lagoons and a sudden
increase of the brooks proper thunder

You cant stand all the time Take a chair Midmore said presently

Rhoda looked back into the bare room The carpet bein up does make a
difference Thank you sir I will ave a setdown

Right over the drive now said Midmore He opened the window and
leaned out Is that wind up the valley Rhoda

No thats it But Ive seen it before

There was not so much a roar as the purposeful drive of a tide across a
jagged reef which put down every other sound for twenty minutes A wide
sheet of water hurried up to the little terrace on which the house
stood pushed round either corner rose again and stretched as it were
yawning beneath the moonlight joined other sheets waiting for them in
unsuspected hollows and lay out all in one A puff of wind followed

Its right up to the wall now I can touch it with my finger Midmore
bent over the windowsill

I can ear it in the cellars said Rhoda dolefully Well weve done
what we can I think Ill ave a look She left the room and was absent
half an hour or more during which time he saw a fullgrown tree
hauling itself across the lawn by its naked roots Then a hurdle knocked
against the wall caught on an iron footscraper just outside and made
a squareheaded ripple The cascade through the cellarwindows
diminished

Its dropping Rhoda cried as she returned Its only tricklin into
my cellars now

Wait a minute I believeI believe I can see the scraper on the edge
of the drive just showing

In another ten minutes the drive itself roughened and became gravel
again tilting all its water towards the shrubbery

The ponds gone past Rhoda announced We shall only ave the common
flood to contend with now Youd better go to bed

I ought to go down and have another look at Sidney before daylight

No need You can see is light burnin from all the upstairs windows

By the way I forgot about her Whereve you put her

In my bed Rhodas tone was ice I wasnt going to undo a room for
that stuff

But itit couldnt be helped said Midmore She was half drowned
One mustnt be narrowminded Rhoda even if her position isnt
quiteerregular

Pfff I wasnt worryin about that She leaned forward to the window
Theres the edge of the lawn showin now It falls as fast as it rises
Deariethe change of tone made Midmore jumpdidnt you know that I
was is first Thats what makes it so hard to bear Midmore looked
at the long lizardlike back and had no words

She went on still talking through the black windowpane

Your pore dear auntie was very kind about it She said shed make all
allowances for one but no more Never any more Then you didnt
know oo Charlie was all this time

Your nephew I always thought

Well well she spoke pityingly Everybodys business being nobodys
business I suppose no one thought to tell you But Charlie made is own
way for imself from the beginnin But her upstairs she never
produced anything Just an ousekeeper as you might say Turned over
an went to sleep straight off She ad the impudence to ask me for ot
sherrygruel

Did you give it to her said Midmore

Me Your sherry No

The memory of Sidneys outrageous rhyme at the window and Charlies
long nose he thought it looked interested at the time as he passed the
copies of Mrs Werfs last four wills overcame Midmore without warning

This damp is givin you a cold said Rhoda rising There you go
again Sneezins a sure sign of it Better go to bed You cant do any
thin excepshe stood rigid with crossed armsabout me

Well What about you Midmore stuffed the handkerchief into his
pocket

Now you know about it what are you goin to dosir

She had the answer on her lean cheek before the sentence was finished

Go and see if you can get us something to eat Rhoda And beer

I expec the larderll be in a swim she replied but old bottled
stuff dont take any harm from wet She returned with a tray all in
order and they ate and drank together and took observations of the
falling flood till dawn opened its bleared eyes on the wreck of what had
been a fair garden Midmore cold and annoyed found himself humming

     That flood strewed wrecks upon the grass
     That ebb swept out the flocks to sea

There isnt a rose left Rhoda

     An awesome ebb and flow it was
     To many more than mine and me
     But each will mourn his 

Itll cost me a hundred

Now we know the worst said Rhoda we can go to bed Ill lay on the
kitchen sofa His lights burnin still

And she

Dirty old cat You ought to ear er snore

At ten oclock in the morning after a maddening hour in his own garden
on the edge of the retreating brook Midmore went off to confront more
damage at Sidneys The first thing that met him was the pig snowy
white for the water had washed him out of his new sty calling on high
heaven for breakfast The front door had been forced open and the flood
had registered its own height in a brown dado on the walls Midmore
chased the pig out and called up the stairs

I be abed o course Which step as she rose to Sidney cried from
above The fourth Then its beat all records Come up

Are you ill Midmore asked as he entered the room The red eyelids
blinked cheerfully Mr Sidney beneath a sumptuous patchwork quilt
was smoking

Nah Im only thankin God I aint my own landlord Take that cheer
Whats she done

It hasnt gone down enough for me to make sure

Them floodgates o yournll be middlin far down the brook by now an
your rosegarden have gone after em I saved my chickens though Youd
better get Mus Sperrit to take the law o Lotten an is fishpond

No thanks Ive trouble enough without that

Hev ye Mr Sidney grinned How did ye make out with those two women
o mine last night I lay they fought

You infernal old scoundrel Midmore laughed

I bean then again I baint was the placid answer But Rhoda
she wouldnt ha left me last night Fire or flood she wouldnt

Why didnt you ever marry her Midmore asked

Waste of good money She was willin without

There was a step on the gritty mud below and a voice humming Midmore
rose quickly saying Well I suppose youre all right now

I be I aint a landlord nor I aint youngnor anxious Oh Mus
Midmore Would it make any odds about her thirty pounds comin regular
if I married her Charlie said maybe twould

Did he Midmore turned at the door And what did Jimmy say about it

Jimmy Mr Sidney chuckled as the joke took him Oh hes none o
mine Hes Charlies lookout

Midmore slammed the door and ran downstairs

Well this is asweetmess said Miss Sperrit in shortest skirts and
heaviest ridingboots I had to come down and have a look at it The
old mayor climbed the belfry tower Been up all night nursing
your family

Nearly that Isnt it cheerful He pointed through the door to the
stairs with small twigdrift on the last three treads

Its a record though said she and hummed to herself

     That flood strewed wrecks upon the grass
     That ebb swept out the flocks to sea

Youre always singing that arent you Midmore said suddenly as she
passed into the parlour where slimy chairs had been stranded at
all angles

Am I Now I come to think of it I believe I do They say I always hum
when I ride Have you noticed it

Of course I have I notice every

Oh she went on hurriedly We had it for the village cantata last
winterThe Brides of Enderby

No High Tide on the Coast of Lincolnshire For some reason Midmore
spoke sharply

Just like that She pointed to the befouled walls I say Lets
get this furniture a little straight You know it too

Every word since you sang it of course

When

The first night I ever came down You rode past the drawingroom window
in the dark singing itAnd sweeter woman

I thought the house was empty then Your aunt always let us use that
short cut Hahadnt we better get this out into the passage Itll all
have to come out anyhow You take the other side They began to lift a
heavyish table Their words came jerkily between gasps and their faces
were as white asa newly washed and very hungry pig

Look out Midmore shouted His legs were whirled from under him as
the table grunting madly careened and knocked the girl out of sight

The wild boar of Asia could not have cut down a couple more
scientifically but this little pig lacked his ancestors nerve and fled
shrieking over their bodies

Are you hurt darling was Midmores first word and NoIm only
windeddear was Miss Sperrits as he lifted her out of her corner
her hat over one eye and her right cheek a smear of mud

They fed him a little later on some chickenfeed that they found in
Sidneys quiet barn a pail of buttermilk out of the dairy and a
quantity of onions from a shelf in the backkitchen

Seedonions most likely said Connie Youll hear about this

What does it matter They ought to have been gilded We must buy him

And keep him as long as he lives she agreed But I think I ought to
go home now You see when I came out I didnt expect  Did you

No Yes It had to come But if any one had told me an hour
ago Sidneys unspeakable parlourand the mud on the carpet

Oh I say Is my cheek clean now

Not quite Lend me your hanky again a minute darling What a purler
you came

You cant talk Remember when your chin hit that table and you said
blast I was just going to laugh

You didnt laugh when I picked you up You were going oooooo like a
little owl

My dear child

Say that again

My dear child Do you really like it I keep it for my best friends
My deear child I thought I was going to be sick there and then He
knocked every ounce of wind out of methe angel But I must really go

They set off together very careful not to join hands or take arms

Not across the fields said Midmore at the stile Come round byby
your own place

She flushed indignantly

It will be yours in a little time he went on shaken with his own
audacity

Not so much of your little times if you please She shied like a colt
across the road then instantly like a colt her eyes lit with new
curiosity as she came in sight of the drivegates

And not quite so much of your airs and graces Madam Midmore
returned or I wont let you use our drive as a short cut any more

Oh Ill be good Ill be good Her voice changed suddenly I swear
Ill try to be good dear Im not much of a thing at the best What
made you

Im worseworse Miles and oceans worse But what does it matter now

They halted beside the gatepillars

I see she said looking up the sodden carriage sweep to the front
door porch where Rhoda was slapping a wet mat to and fro I see
Now I really must go home No Dont you come I must speak to Mother
first all by myself

He watched her up the hill till she was out of sight




     THE FLOODS

     The rain it rains without a stay
       In the hills above us in the hills
     And presently the floods break way
       Whose strength is in the hills
     The trees they suck from every cloud
     The valley brooks they roar aloud
     Bankhigh for the lowlands lowlands
       Lowlands under the hills

     The first wood down is sere and small
       From the hills the brishings off the hills
     And then come by the bats and all
       We cut last year in the hills
     And then the roots we tried to cleave
     But found too tough and had to leave
     Polting through the lowlands lowlands
       Lowlands under the hills

     The eye shall look the ear shall hark
       To the hills the doings in the hills
     And rivers mating in the dark
       With tokens from the hills
     Now what is weak will surely go
     And what is strong must prove it so
     Stand fast in the lowlands lowlands
       Lowlands under the hills

     The floods they shall not be afraid
       Nor the hills above em nor the hills
     Of any fence which man has made
       Betwixt him and the hills
     The waters shall not reckon twice
     For any work of mans device
     But bid it down to the lowlands lowlands
       Lowlands under the hills

     The floods shall sweep corruption clean
       By the hills the blessing of the hills
     That more the meadows may be green
       Newamended from the hills
     The crops and cattle shall increase
     Nor little children shall not cease
     Goplough the lowlands lowlands
       Lowlands under the hills




     THE FABULISTS

     When all the world would have a matter hid
       Since Truth is seldom friend to any crowd
     Men write in fable as old sop did
       Jesting at that which none will name aloud
     And this they needs must do or it will fall
     Unless they please they are not heard at all

     When desperate Folly daily laboureth
       To work confusion upon all we have
     When diligent Sloth demandeth Freedoms death
       And banded Fear commandeth Honours grave
     Even in that certain hour before the fall
     Unless men please they are not heard at all

     Needs must all please yet some not all for need
       Needs must all toil yet some not all for gain
     But that men taking pleasure may take heed
       Whom present toil shall snatch from later pain
     Thus some have toiled but their reward was small
     Since though they pleased they were not heard at all

     This was the lock that lay upon our lips
       This was the yoke that we have undergone
     Denying us all pleasant fellowships
       As in our time and generation
     Our pleasures unpursued age past recall
     And for our painswe are not heard at all

     What man hears aught except the groaning guns
       What man heeds aught save what each instant brings
     When each mans life all imaged life outruns
       What man shall pleasure in imaginings
     So it hath fallen as it was bound to fall
       We are not nor we were not heard at all



The Vortex

August 

     Thy Lord spoke by inspiration to the Bee

     AL KORAN

I have to my grief and loss suppressed several notable stories of my
friend the Hon AM Penfentenyou once Minister of Woods and
Waysides in De Thouars first administration later Premier in all but
name of one of Our great and growing Dominions and now as always the
idol of his own Province which is two and onehalf the size of England

Footnote  See The Puzzler Actions and Reactions

For this reason I hold myself at liberty to deal with some portion of
the truth concerning Penfentenyous latest visit to Our shores He
arrived at my house by car on a hot summer day in a white waistcoat
and spats sweeping black frockcoat and glistening tophata little
rounded perhaps at the edges but agile as ever in mind and body

What is the trouble now I asked for the last time we had met
Penfentenyou was floating a threemillion pound loan for his beloved but
unscrupulous Province and I did not wish to entertain any more of his
financial friends

We Penfentenyou replied ambassadorially have come to have a Voice
in Your Councils By the way the Voice is coming down on the evening
train with my AgentGeneral I thought you wouldnt mind if I invited
em You know Were going to share Your burdens henceforward Youd
better get into training

Certainly I replied Whats the Voice like

Hes in earnest said Penfentenyou Hes got It and hes got It bad
Hell give It to you he said

Whats his name

We call him all sorts of names but I think youd better call him Mr
Lingnam You wont have to do it more than once

Whats he suffering from

The Empire Hes pretty nearly cured us all of Imperialism at home
Praps hell cure you

Very good What am I to do with him

Dont you worry said Penfentenyou Hell do it

And when Mr Lingnam appeared halfanhour later with the AgentGeneral
for Penfentenyous Dominion he did just that

He advanced across the lawn eloquent as all the tides He said he had
been observing to the AgentGeneral that it was both politically immoral
and strategically unsound that fortyfour million people should bear the
entire weight of the defences of Our mighty Empire but as he had
observed here the AgentGeneral evaporated we stood now upon the
threshold of a new era in which the selfgoverning and selfrespecting
bis Dominions would rightly and righteously as copartners in Empery
shoulder their share of any burden which the PanImperial Council of
the Future should allot The AgentGeneral was already arranging for
drinks with Penfentenyou at the other end of the garden Mr Lingnam
swept me on to the most remote bench and settled to his theme

We dined at eight At nine Mr Lingnam was only drawing abreast of
things Imperial At ten the AgentGeneral who earns his salary was
shamelessly dozing on the sofa At eleven he and Penfentenyou went to
bed At midnight Mr Lingnam brought down his bigbellied despatch box
with the newspaper clippings and set to federating the Empire in
earnest I remember that he had three alternative plans As a dealer in
words I plumped for the resonant thirdReciprocally coordinated
Senatorial Hegemonywhich he then elaborated in detail for
threequarters of an hour At halfpast one he urged me to have faith
and to remember that nothing mattered except the Idea Then he retired
to his room accompanied by one glass of cold water and I went into the
dawnlit garden and prayed to any Power that might be off duty for the
blood of Mr Lingnam Penfentenyou and the AgentGeneral

To me as I have often observed elsewhere the hour of earliest dawn is
fortunate and the wind that runs before it has ever been my most
comfortable counsellor

Wait it said all among the nights expectant rosebuds Tomorrow is
also a day Wait upon the Event

I went to bed so at peace with God and Man and Guest that when I waked I
visited Mr Lingnam in pyjamas and he talked to me PanImperially for
halfanhour before his bath Later the AgentGeneral said he had
letters to write and Penfentenyou invented a Cabinet crisis in his
adored Dominion which would keep him busy with codes and cables all the
forenoon But I said firmly Mr Lingnam wishes to see a little of the
country round here You are coming with us in your own car

Its a hired one Penfentenyou objected

Yes Paid for by me as a taxpayer I replied

And yours has a top and the weather looks thundery said the
AgentGeneral Ours hasnt a windscreen Even our goggles were hired

Ill lend you goggles I said My car is under repairs

The hireling who had looked to be returned to London spat and growled on
the drive She was an open car capable of some eighteen miles on the
flat with tetanic gears and a perpetual palsy

It wont make the least difference sighed the AgentGeneral Hell
only raise his voice He did it all the way coming down

I say said Penfentenyou suspiciously what are you doing all this
for

Love of the Empire I answered as Mr Lingnam tripped up in dustcoat
and binoculars Now Mr Lingnam will tell us exactly what he wants to
see He probably knows more about England than the rest of us put
together

I read it up yesterday said Mr Lingnam simply While we stowed the
lunchbasket one can never make too sure with a hired car he outlined
a very pretty and instructive little days run

Youll drive of course said Penfentenyou to him Its the only
thing you know anything about

This astonished me for your greater Federationists are rarely
mechanicians but Mr Lingnam said he would prefer to be inside for the
present and enjoy our conversation

Well settled on the back seat he did not once lift his eyes to the
mellow landscape around him or throw a word at the life of the English
road which to me is one renewed and unreasoned orgy of delight The
mustardcoloured scouts of the Automobile Association their natural
enemies the unjust police our natural enemies the deliberate
marketday cattle broadsideon at all corners the bicycling
butcherboy a furlong behind roadengines that pulled giddygorounds
rifle galleries and swings and sucked snortingly from wayside ponds in
defiance of the noticeboard tractionengines their trailers piled
high with road metal uniformed village nurses one per seven statute
miles flitting by on their wheels governesscarts full of pink
children jogging unconcernedly past roaring brazen touringcars the
wayside rector with virgins in attendance their faces screwed up
against our dust motorbicycles of every shape charging down at every
angle red flags of rifleranges detachments of dustyputteed
Territorials coveys of flagrant children playing in midstreet and the
wise educated English dog safe and quite silent on the pavement if his
foolmistress would but cease from trying to save him passed and
repassed us in sunlit or shaded settings But Mr Lingnam only talked
He talkedwe all sat together behind so that we could not escape
himand he talked above the worn gears and a certain maddening swish of
one badly patched tireand he talked of the Federation of the Empire
against all conceivable dangers except himself Yet I was neither
brutally rude like Penfentenyou nor swooningly bored like the
AgentGeneral I remembered a certain Joseph Finsbury who delighted the
Tregonwell Arms on the borders of the New Forest with nineit should
have been tenversions of a single income of two hundred pounds
placing the imaginary person inbut I could not recall the list of
towns further than London Paris Bagdad and Spitsbergen This last I
must have murmured aloud for the AgentGeneral suddenly became human
and went on Bussorah Heligoland and the Scilly Islands

What growled Penfentenyou

Nothing said the AgentGeneral squeezing my hand affectionately
Only we have just found out that we are brothers

Exactly said Mr Lingnam Thats what Ive been trying to lead up
to Were all brothers Dyou realise that fifteen years ago such a
conversation as were having would have been unthinkable The Empire
wouldnt have been ripe for it To go back even ten years

Ive got it cried the AgentGeneral Brighton Cincinnati and
NijniNovgorod God bless RLS Go on Uncle Joseph I can endure
much now

Mr Lingnam went on like our shandrydan slowly and loudly He admitted
that a man obsessed with a Central Ideaand after all the only thing
that mattered was the Ideamight become a bore but the Worlds Work
he pointed out had been done by bores So he laid his bones down to
that work till we abandoned ourselves to the passage of time and the
Mercy of Allah Who Alone closes the Mouths of His Prophets And we
wasted more than fifty miles of summers vivid own England upon him
the while

About two oclock we topped Sumtner Rising and looked down on the
village of Sumtner Barton which lies just across a single railway line
spanned by a red brick bridge The thick thunderous June airs brought
us gusts of melody from a giddygoround steamorgan in full blast near
the pond on the village green Drums too thumped and banners waved and
regalia flashed at the far end of the broad village street Mr Lingnam
asked why

Nothing Imperial Im afraid It looks like a Foresters Fteone of
our big Mutual Benefit Societies I explained

The Idea only needs to be coordinated to Imperial scale he began

But it means that the pub will be crowded I went on

Whats the matter with lunching by the roadside here said
Penfentenyou Weve got the lunchbasket

Havent you ever heard of Sumtner Barton ales I demanded and be
became the administrator at once saying I see Lingnam can drive us
in and well get some while Holfordthis was the hireling chauffeur
whose views on beer we knew notlays out lunch here Thatll be better
than eating at the pub We can take in the Foresters Fte as well and
perhaps I can buy some newspapers at the station

True I answered The railway station is just under that bridge and
well come back and lunch here

I indicated a terrace of cool clean shade beneath kindly beeches at the
head of Sumtner Rise As Holford got out the lunchbasket a detachment
of Regular troops on manoeuvres swung down the baking road

Ah said Mr Lingnam the monthlymagazine roll in his voice All
Europe is an armed camp groaning as I remember I once wrote under the
weight of its accoutrements

Oh hop in and drive cried Penfentenyou We want that beer

It made no difference Mr Lingnam could have federated the Empire from
a tight rope He continued his oration at the wheel as we trundled

The danger to the Younger Nations is of being drawn into this vortex of
Militarism he went on dodging the rear of the soldiery

Slow past troops I hinted It saves em dust And we overtake on the
right as a rule in England

Thanks Mr Lingnam slued over Thats another detail which needs to
be coordinated throughout the Empire But to go back to what I was
saying My idea has always been that the component parts of the Empire
should take counsel among themselves on the approach of war so that
after we have decided on the merits of the casus belli we can
coordinate what part each Dominion shall play whenever war is
unfortunately a possibility

We neared the hogback railway bridge and the hireling knocked
piteously at the grade Mr Lingnam changed gears and she hoisted
herself up to a joyous Youpiaddyiay from the steamorgan As we
topped the arch we saw a Foresters band with banners marching down
the street

Thats all very fine said the AgentGeneral but in real life things
have a knack of happening without approaching

                                   

Some schools of Thought hold that Time is not and that when we attain
complete enlightenment we shall behold past present and future as One
Awful Whole I myself have nearly achieved this

                                   

We dipped over the bridge into the village A boy on a bicycle loaded
with four paper bonnetboxes pedalled towards us out of an alley on
our right He bowed his head the better to overcome the ascent and
naturally took his left Mr Lingnam swerved frantically to the right
Penfentenyou shouted The boy looked up saw the car was like to squeeze
him against the bridge wall flung himself off his machine and across
the narrow pavement into the nearest house He slammed the door at the
precise moment when the car all brakes set bunted the abandoned
bicycle shattering three of the bonnetboxes and jerking the fourth
over the unscreened dashboard into Mr Lingnams arms

There was a dead stillness then a hiss like that of escaping steam and
a man who had been running towards us ran the other way

Why I think that those must be bees said Mr Lingnam

They werefour full swarmsand the first living objects which he had
remarked upon all day

Some one said Oh God The AgentGeneral went out over the back of
the car crying resolutely Stop the traffic Stop the traffic there
Penfentenyou was already on the pavement ringing a doorbell so I had
both their rugs whichfor I am an apiaristI threw over my head
While I was tucking my trousers into my socksfor I am an apiarist of
experienceMr Lingnam picked up the unexploded bonnetbox and with a
single magnificent gesture he told us afterwards he thought there was a
river beneath hurled it over the parapet of the bridge ere he ran
across the road towards the village green Now the station platform
immediately below was crowded with Foresters and their friends waiting
to welcome a delegation from a sister Court I saw the box burst on the
flint edging of the station garden and the contents sweep forward
conewise like shrapnel But the result was stimulating rather than
sedative All those welldressed people below shouted like Sodom and
Gomorrah Then they moved as a unit into the bookingoffice the
waitingrooms and other places shut doors and windows and declaimed
aloud while the incoming train whistled far down the line

I pivoted round crosslegged on the back seat like a Circassian beauty
beneath her veil and saw Penfentenyou his coatcollar over his ears
dancing before a shut door and holding up handfuls of currency to a
silverhaired woman at an upper window who only mouthed and shook her
head A little child carrying a kitten came smiling round a corner
Suddenly but these things moved me no more than so many yards of
threepenny cinematographfilm the kitten leaped spitting from her
arms the child burst into tears Penfentenyou still dancing snatched
her up and tucked her under his coat the womans countenance blanched
the front door opened Penfentenyou and the child pressed through and I
was alone in an inhospitable world where every one was shutting windows
and calling children home

A voice cried Youve frowtened em Youve frowtened em Throw dust
on em and theyll settle

I did not desire to throw dust on any created thing I needed both hands
for my draperies and two more for my stockings Besides the bees were
doing me no hurt They recognised me as a member of the County
Beekeepers Association who had paid his annual subscription and was
entitled to a free seat at all apicultural exhibitions The quiver and
the churn of the hireling car or it might have been the lurching
banners and the arrogant big drum inclined many of them to go up
street and pay court to the advancing Foresters band So they went
such as had not followed Mr Lingnam in his flight toward the green and
I looked out of two goggled eyes instead of half a one at the
approaching musicians while I listened with both ears to the delayed
trains second whistle down the line beneath me

The Foresters band no more knew what was coming than do troops under
sudden fire Indeed there were the same extravagant gestures and
contortions as attend wounds and deaths in war the very same uncanny
cessations of speechfor the trombone was cut off at midslide even as
a man drops with a syllable on his tongue They clawed they slapped
they fled leaving behind them a trophy of banners and brasses crudely
arranged round the big drum Then that end of the street also shut its
windows and the village stripped of life lay round me like a reef at
low tide Though I am as I have said an apiarist in good standing I
never realised that there were so many bees in the world When they had
woven a flashing haze from one end of the desert street to the other
there remained reserves enough to form knops and pendules on all
windowsills and gutterends without diminishing the multitudes in the
three oozing bonnetboxes or drawing on the Fourth Railway Battalion
in charge of the station below The prisoners in the waitingrooms and
other places there cried out a great deal I argued that they were dying
of the heat and at regular intervals the stationmaster called and
called to a signalman who was not on duty and the train whistled as it
drew nearer

Then Penfentenyou venal and adaptable politician of the type that
survives at the price of all the higher emotions appeared at the window
of the house on my right broken and congested with mirth the woman
beside him and the child in his arms I saw his mouth open and shut he
hollowed his hands round it but the churr of the motor and the bees
drowned his words He pointed dramatically across the street many times
and fell back tears running down his face I turned like a hooded
barbette in a heavy seaway not knowing when my trousers would come out
of my socks again through one hundred and eighty degrees and in due
time bore on the village green There was a salmon in the pond rising
short at a cloud of midges to the tune of Yipiaddy but there was
none to gaff him The swingboats were empty cocoanuts sat still on
their red sticks before white screens and the gaypainted horses of the
giddygorounds revolved riderless All was melody green turf bright
water and this greedy gambolling fish When I had identified it by its
grey gills and binoculars as Lingnam I prostrated myself before Allah
in that mirth which is more truly labour than any prayer Then I turned
to the purple Penfentenyou at the window and wiped my eyes on the
rug edge

He raised the window half one cautious inch and bellowed through the
crack Did you see him Have they got you I can see lots of
things from here Its like a threering circus

Can you see the station I replied nodding toward the right rear
mudguard

He twisted and craned sideways but could not command that beautiful
view

No Whats it like he cried

Hell I shouted The silverhaired woman frowned so did Penfentenyou
and I think apologised to her for my language

Youre always so extreme he fluted reproachfully You forget that
nothing matters except the Idea Besides they are this ladys bees

He closed the window and introduced us through it in dumb show but he
contrived to give the impression that I was the specimen under glass

A spurt of damp steam saved me from apoplexy The train had lost
patience at last and was coming into the station directly beneath me to
see what was the matter Happy voices sang and heads were thrust out all
along the compartments but none answered their songs or greetings She
halted and the people began to get out Then they began to get in
again as their friends in the waitingrooms advised All did not catch
the warning so there was congestion at the doors but those whom the
bees caught got in first

Still the bees more bent on their own business than wanton torture
kept to the south end of the platform by the bookstall and that was why
the completely exposed enginedriver at the north end of the train did
not at first understand the hermetically sealed stationmaster when the
latter shouted to him many times to get on out o this

Where are you was the reply And what for

It dont matter where I am an youll get whatfor in a minute if you
dont shift said the stationmaster Drop em at Parsons Meadow and
they can walk up over the fields

That barearmed thinshirted idiot leaning out of the cab took the
stationmasters orders as an insult to his dignity and roared at the
shut offices Youll give me whatfor will you Look ere Im not in
the abit of His outstretched hand flew to his neck Do you know
that if you sting an enginedriver it is the same as stinging his train
She starts with a jerk that nearly smashes the couplings and runs
barking like a dog till she is out of sight Nor does she think about
spilled people and parted families on the platform behind her I had to
do all that There was a man called Fred and his wife Harrieta
cheery fullblooded couplewho interested me immensely before they
battered their way into a small detached building already densely
occupied There was also a nameless bachelor who sat under a halfopened
umbrella and twirled it dizzily which was so new a game that I
applauded aloud

When they had thoroughly cleared the ground the bees set about making
comb for publication at the bookstall counter Presently some bold
hearts tiptoed out of the waitingrooms over the loud gravel with the
consciously modest air of men leaving church climbed the wooden
staircase to the bridge and so reached my level where the
inexhaustible bonnetboxes were still vomiting squadrons and platoons
There was little need to bid them descend They had wrapped their heads
in handkerchiefs so that they looked like the disappointed dead
scuttling back to Purgatory Only one old gentleman pontifically draped
in a banner embroidered Temperance and Fortitude ran the gauntlet
upstreet shouting as he passed me Its night or Blcher Mister
They let him in at the White Hart the pub where I should have
bought the beer

After this the day sagged I fell to reckoning how long a man in a
Turkish bath weakened by excessive laughter could live without food
and specially drink and how long a disenfranchised bee could hold out
under the same conditions

Obviously since her one practical joke costs her her life the bee can
have but small sense of humour but her fundamentally dismal and
ungracious outlook on life impressed me beyond words She had paralysed
locomotion wiped out trade social intercourse mutual trust love
friendship sport music the lonely steamorgan had run down at last
all that gives substance colour or savour to life and yet in the
barren desert she had created was not one whit more near to the
evolution of a saner order of things The Heavens were darkened with the
swarms divided counsels the street shimmered with their purposeless
sallies They clotted on tiles and gutterpipes and began frenziedly to
build a cell or two of comb ere they discovered that their queen was
not with them then flung off to seek her or whirled dishevelled and
insane into another hissing nebula on the false rumour that she was
there I scowled upon them with disfavour and a massy blue
thunderhead rose majestically from behind the elmtrees of Sumtner
Barton Rectory arched over and scowled with me Then I realised that it
was not bees nor locusts that had darkened the skies but the oncoming
of the malignant English thunderstormthe one thing before which even
Deborah the bee cannot express her silly little self

Aha Now youll catch it I said as the herald gusts set the big
drum rolling down the street like a boxkite Up and up yearned the dark
cloud till the first lightning quivered and cut Deborah cowered Where
she flew there she fled where she was there she sat still and the
solid rain closed in on her as a book that is closed when the chapter is
finished By the time it had soaked to my second rug Penfentenyou
appeared at the window wiping his false mouth on a napkin

Are you all right he inquired Then thats all right Mrs Bellamy
says that her bees dont sting in the wet Youd better fetch Lingnam
over Hes got to pay for them and the bicycle

I had no words which the silverhaired lady could listen to but paddled
across the flooded street between flashes to the pond on the green Mr
Lingnam scarcely visible through the sheeting downpour trotted round
the edge He bore himself nobly and lied at the mere sight of me

Isnt this wet he cried It has drenched me to the skin I shall
need a change

Come along I said I dont know what youll get but you deserve
more

Penfentenyou dry fed and in command let us in You he whispered
to me are to wait in the scullery Mrs Bellamy didnt like the way
you talked about her bees Hsh Hsh Shes a kindhearted lady Shes a
widow Lingnam but shes kept his clothes and as soon as youve paid
for the damage shell rent you a suit Ive arranged it all

Then tell him he mustnt undress in my hall said a voice from the
stairhead

Tell her Lingnam began

Come and look at the pretty suit Ive chosen Penfentenyou cooed as
one cajoling a maniac

I staggered outofdoors again and fell into the car whose
everrunning machinery masked my yelps and hiccups When I raised my
forehead from the wheel I saw that traffic through the village had been
resumed after as my watch showed one and onehalf hours suspension
There were two limousines one landau one doctors car three
touringcars one patent steamlaundry van three tricars one
tractionengine some motorcycles one with a sidecar and one brewery
lorry It was the allegory of my own imperturbable country delayed for
a short time by unforeseen external events but now going about her
business and I blessed Her with tears in my eyes even though I knew
She looked upon me as drunk and incapable

Then troops came over the bridge behind mea company of dripping wet
Regulars without any expression In their rear carrying the
lunchbasket marched the AgentGeneral and Holford the hired chauffeur

I say said the AgentGeneral nodding at the darkened khaki backs
If thats what weve got to depend on in event of war theyre a
broken reed They ran like haresran like hares I tell you

And you I asked

Oh I just sauntered back over the bridge and stopped the traffic that
end Then I had lunch Pity about the beer though I saythese
cushions are sopping wet

Im sorry I said I havent had time to turn em

Nor there wasnt any need to ave kept the engine runnin all this
time said Holford sternly Ill ave to account for the expenditure
of petrol It exceeds the mileage indicated you see

Im sorry I repeated After all that is the way that taxpayers
regard most crises

The housedoor opened and Penfentenyou and another came out into the now
thinning rain

Ah There you both are Heres Lingnam he cried Hes got a little
wet Hes had to change

We saw that I was too sore and weak to begin another laugh but the
AgentGeneral crumpled up where he stood The late Mr Bellamy must have
been a man of tremendous personality which he had impressed on every
angle of his garments I was told later that he had died in delirium
tremens which at once explained the pattern and the reason why Mr
Lingnam writhing inside it swore so inspiredly Of the deliberate and
diffuse Federationist there remained no trace save the binoculars and
two damp whiskers We stood on the pavement before Elemental Man
calling on Elemental Powers to condemn and incinerate Creation

Well hadnt we better be getting back said the AgentGeneral

Look out I remarked casually Those bonnetboxes are full of bees
still

Are they said the livid Mr Lingnam and tilted them over with the
late Mr Bellamys large boots Deborah rolled out in drenched lumps
into the swilling gutter There was a muffled shriek at the window where
Mrs Bellamy gesticulated

Its all right Ive paid for them said Mr Lingnam He dumped out
the last dregs like mould from a potbound flowerpot

What Are you going to take em home with you said the AgentGeneral

No He passed a wet hand over his streaky forehead Wasnt there a
bicycle that was the beginning of this trouble said he

Its under the foreaxle sir said Holford promptly I can fish it
out from ere

Not till Ive done with it please Before we could stop him he had
jumped into the car and taken charge The hireling leaped into her
collar surged shrieked less loudly than Mrs Bellamy at the window
and swept on That which came out behind her was as Holford truly
observed no joywheel Mr Lingnam swung round the big drum in the
marketplace and thundered back shouting Leave it alone Its
my meat

Mincemeat e means said Holford after this second trituration You
couldnt say now it ad ever been one could you

Mrs Bellamy opened the window and spoke It appears she had only
charged for damage to the bicycle not for the entire machine which Mr
Lingnam was ruthlessly gleaning spoke by spoke from the highway and
cramming into the slack of the hood At last he answered and I have
never seen a man foam at the mouth before If you dont stop I shall
come into your housein this carand drive upstairs andkill you

She stopped he stopped Holford took the wheel and we got away It was
time for the sun shone after the storm and Deborah beneath the tiles
and the eaves already felt its reviving influence compel her to her
interrupted labours of federation We warned the village policeman at
the far end of the street that he might have to suspend traffic again
The proprietor of the giddygoround swings and cocoanutshies wanted
to know from whom in this world or another he could recover damages
Mr Lingnam referred him most directly to Mrs Bellamy Then we
went home

After dinner that evening Mr Lingnam rose stiffly in his place to make
a few remarks on the Federation of the Empire on the lines of
Coordinated Offensive Operations backed by the Entire Effective
Forces Moral Military and Fiscal of Permanently Mobilised
Communities the whole brought to bear without any respect to the
merits of any casus belli instantaneously automatically and
remorselessly at the first faint buzz of war

The trouble with Us said he is that We take such an infernally long
time making sure that We are right that We dont go ahead when things
happen For instance I ought to have gone ahead instead of pulling up
when I hit that bicycle

But you were in the wrong Lingnam when you turned to the right I
put in

I dont want to hear any more of your damned detached mugwumping
excuses for the other fellow he snapped

Now youre beginning to see things said Penfentenyou I hope you
wont backslide when the swellings go down



THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES

     I was Lord of Cities very sumptuously builded
     Seven roaring Cities paid me tribute from afar
     Ivory their outposts werethe guardrooms of them
       gilded
     And garrisoned with Amazons invincible in war

     All the world went softly when it walked before my
       Cities
     Neither King nor Army vexed my peoples at their toil
     Never horse nor chariot irked or overbore my Cities
     Never Mob nor Ruler questioned whence they drew
       their spoil

     Banded mailed and arrogant from sunrise unto sunset
     Singing while they sacked it they possessed the land
       at large
     Yet when men would rob them they resisted they
       made onset
     And pierced the smoke of battle with a thousandsabred
       charge

     So they warred and trafficked only yesterday my Cities
     Today there is no mark or mound of where my Cities
       stood
     For the River rose at midnight and it washed away my
       Cities
     They are evened with Atlantis and the towns before the
       Flood

     Rain on raingorged channels raised the waterlevels
       round them
     Freshet backed on freshet swelled and swept their
       world from sight
     Till the emboldened floods linked arms and flashing forward
       drowned them
     Drowned my Seven Cities and their peoples in one
       night

     Low among the alders lie their derelict foundations
     The beams wherein they trusted and the plinths whereon
       they built
     My rulers and their treasure and their unborn populations
     Dead destroyed aborted and defiled with mud and
       silt

     The Daughters of the Palace whom they cherished in
       my Cities
     My silvertongued Princesses and the promise of their
       May
     Their bridegrooms of the Junetideall have perished
       in my Cities
     With the harsh envenomed virgins that can neither
       love nor play

     I was Lord of CitiesI will build anew my Cities
     Seven set on rocks above the wrath of any flood
     Nor will I rest from search till I have filled anew my Cities
     With peoples undefeated of the dark enduring blood

     To the sound of trumpets shall their seed restore my Cities
     Wealthy and wellweaponed that once more may I behold
     All the world go softly when it walks before my Cities
     And the horses and the chariots fleeing from them as of old



Swept and Garnished

January 

When the first waves of feverish cold stole over Frau Ebermann she very
wisely telephoned for the doctor and went to bed He diagnosed the
attack as mild influenza prescribed the appropriate remedies and left
her to the care of her one servant in her comfortable Berlin flat Frau
Ebermann beneath the thick coverlet curled up with what patience she
could until the aspirin should begin to act and Anna should come back
from the chemist with the formamint the ammoniated quinine the
eucalyptus and the little tin steaminhaler Meantime every bone in
her body ached her head throbbed her hot dry hands would not stay the
same size for a minute together and her body tucked into the smallest
possible compass shrank from the chill of the wellwarmed sheets

Of a sudden she noticed that an imitationlace cover which should have
lain mathematically square with the imitationmarble top of the radiator
behind the green plush sofa had slipped away so that one corner hung
over the bronzepainted steam pipes She recalled that she must have
rested her poor head against the radiatortop while she was taking off
her boots She tried to get up and set the thing straight but the
radiator at once receded toward the horizon which unlike true
horizons slanted diagonally exactly parallel with the dropped lace
edge of the cover Frau Ebermann groaned through sticky lips and
lay still

Certainly I have a temperature she said Certainly I have a grave
temperature I should have been warned by that chill after dinner

She resolved to shut her hotlidded eyes but opened them in a little
while to torture herself with the knowledge of that ungeometrical thing
against the far wall Then she saw a childan untidy thinfaced little
girl of about ten who must have strayed in from the adjoining flat
This provedFrau Ebermann groaned again at the way the world falls to
bits when one is sickproved that Anna had forgotten to shut the outer
door of the flat when she went to the chemist Frau Ebermann had had
children of her own but they were all grown up now and she had never
been a childlover in any sense Yet the intruder might be made to serve
her scheme of things

Makeput she muttered thickly that white thing straight on the top
of that yellow thing

The child paid no attention but moved about the room investigating
everything that came in her waythe yellow cutglass handles of the
chest of drawers the stamped bronze hook to hold back the heavy puce
curtains and the mauve enamel New Art fingerplates on the door Frau
Ebermann watched indignantly

Aie That is bad and rude Go away she cried though it hurt her to
raise her voice Go away by the road you came The child passed
behind the bedfoot where she could not see her Shut the door as you
go I will speak to Anna butfirst put that white thing straight

She closed her eyes in misery of body and soul The outer door clicked
and Anna entered very penitent that she had stayed so long at the
chemists But it had been difficult to find the proper type of
inhaler and

Where did the child go moaned Frau Ebermannthe child that was
here

There was no child said startled Anna How should any child come in
when I shut the door behind me after I go out All the keys of the flats
are different

No no You forgot this time But my back is aching and up my legs
also Besides who knows what it may have fingered and upset Look
and see

Nothing is fingered nothing is upset Anna replied as she took the
inhaler from its paper box

Yes there is Now I remember all about it Putput that white thing
with the open edgethe lace I meanquite straight on that she
pointed Anna accustomed to her ways understood and went to it

Now is it quite straight Frau Ebermann demanded

Perfectly said Anna In fact in the very centre of the radiator
Anna measured the equal margins with her knuckle as she had been told
to do when she first took service

And my tortoiseshell hair brushes Frau Ebermann could not command
her dressingtable from where she lay

Perfectly straight side by side in the big tray and the comb laid
across them Your watch also in the coralline watchholder
Everythingshe moved round the room to make sureeverything is as
you have it when you are well Frau Ebermann sighed with relief It
seemed to her that the room and her head had suddenly grown cooler

Good said she Now warm my nightgown in the kitchen so it will be
ready when I have perspired And the towels also Make the inhaler
steam and put in the eucalyptus that is good for the larynx Then sit
you in the kitchen and come when I ring But first my
hotwater bottle

It was brought and scientifically tucked in

What news said Frau Ebermann drowsily She had not been out that day

Another victory said Anna Many more prisoners and guns

Frau Ebermann purred one might almost say grunted contentedly

That is good too she said and Anna after lighting the inhalerlamp
went out

Frau Ebermann reflected that in an hour or so the aspirin would begin to
work and all would be well Tomorrowno the day aftershe would
take up life with something to talk over with her friends at coffee It
was rareevery one knew itthat she should be overcome by any
ailment Yet in all her distresses she had not allowed the minutest
deviation from daily routine and ritual She would tell her friendsshe
ran over their names one by oneexactly what measures she had taken
against the lace cover on the radiatortop and in regard to her two
tortoiseshell hair brushes and the comb at right angles How she had
set everything in ordereverything in order She roved further afield
as she wriggled her toes luxuriously on the hotwater bottle If it
pleased our dear God to take her to Himself and she was not so young as
she had beenthere was that plate of the four lower ones in the blue
toothglass for instanceHe should find all her belongings fit to meet
His eye Swept and garnished were the words that shaped themselves in
her intent brain Swept and garnished for

No it was certainly not for the dear Lord that she had swept she would
have her room swept out tomorrow or the day after and garnished Her
hands began to swell again into huge pillows of nothingness Then they
shrank and so did her head to minute dots It occurred to her that she
was waiting for some event some tremendously important event to come
to pass She lay with shut eyes for a long time till her head and hands
should return to their proper size

She opened her eyes with a jerk

How stupid of me she said aloud to set the room in order for a
parcel of dirty little children

They were therefive of them two little boys and three girlsheaded
by the anxiouseyed tenyearold whom she had seen before They must
have entered by the outer door which Anna had neglected to shut behind
her when she returned with the inhaler She counted them backward and
forward as one counts scalesone two three four five

They took no notice of her but hung about first on one foot then on
the other like strayed chickens the smaller ones holding by the
larger They had the air of utterly wearied passengers in a railway
waitingroom and their clothes were disgracefully dirty

Go away cried Frau Ebermann at last after she had struggled it
seemed to her for years to shape the words

You called said Anna at the livingroom door

No said her mistress Did you shut the flat door when you came in

Assuredly said Anna Besides it is made to catch shut of itself

Then go away said she very little above a whisper If Anna pretended
not to see the children she would speak to Anna later on

And now she said turning toward them as soon as the door closed The
smallest of the crowd smiled at her and shook his head before he buried
it in his sisters skirts

Whydontyougoaway she whispered earnestly

Again they took no notice but guided by the elder girl set themselves
to climb boots and all on to the green plush sofa in front of the
radiator The little boys had to be pushed as they could not compass
the stretch unaided They settled themselves in a row with small gasps
of relief and pawed the plush approvingly

I ask youI ask you why do you not go awaywhy do you not go away
Frau Ebermann found herself repeating the question twenty times It
seemed to her that everything in the world hung on the answer You know
you should not come into houses and rooms unless you are invited Not
houses and bedrooms you know

No a solemn little sixyearold repeated not houses nor bedrooms
nor diningrooms nor churches nor all those places Shouldnt come in
Its rude

Yes he said so the younger girl put in proudly He said it He told
them only pigs would do that The line nodded and dimpled one to
another with little explosive giggles such as children use when they
tell deeds of great daring against their elders

If you know it is wrong that makes it much worse said Frau Ebermann

Oh yes much worse they assented cheerfully till the smallest boy
changed his smile to a baby wail of weariness

When will they come for us he asked and the girl at the head of the
row hauled him bodily into her square little capable lap

Hes tired she explained He is only four He only had his first
breeches this spring They came almost under his armpits and were held
up by broad linen braces which his sorrow diverted for the moment he
patted proudly

Yes beautiful dear said both girls

Go away said Frau Ebermann Go home to your father and mother

Their faces grew grave at once

Hsh We cant whispered the eldest There isnt anything left

All gone a boy echoed and he puffed through pursed lips Like
that uncle told me Both cows too

And my own three ducks the boy on the girls lap said sleepily

So you see we came here The elder girl leaned forward a little
caressing the child she rocked

II dont understand said Frau Ebermann Are you lost then You
must tell our police

Oh no we are only waiting

But what are you waiting for

We are waiting for our people to come for us They told us to come here
and wait for them So we are waiting till they come the eldest
girl replied

Yes We are waiting till our people come for us said all the others
in chorus

But said Frau Ebermann very patientlybut now tell me for I tell
you that I am not in the least angry where do you come from Where do
you come from

The five gave the names of two villages of which she had read in the
papers

That is silly said Frau Ebermann The people fired on us and they
were punished Those places are wiped out stamped flat

Yes yes wiped out stamped flat That is why andI have lost the
ribbon off my pigtail said the younger girl She looked behind her
over the sofaback

It is not here said the elder It was lost before Dont you
remember

Now if you are lost you must go and tell our police They will take
care of you and give you food said Frau Ebermann Anna will show you
the way there

Nothis was the sixyearold with the smilewe must wait here
till our people come for us Mustnt we sister

Of course We wait here till our people come for us All the world
knows that said the eldest girl

Yes The boy in her lap had waked again Little children tooas
little as Henri and he doesnt wear trousers yet As little as
all that

I dont understand said Frau Ebermann shivering In spite of the
heat of the room and the damp breath of the steaminhaler the aspirin
was not doing its duty

The girl raised her blue eyes and looked at the woman for an instant

You see she said emphasising her statements with her ringers
they told us to wait here till our people came for us So we
came We wait till our people come for us

That is silly again said Frau Ebermann It is no good for you to
wait here Do you know what this place is You have been to school It
is Berlin the capital of Germany

Yes yes they all cried Berlin capital of Germany We know that
That is why we came

So you see it is no good she said triumphantly because your
people can never come for you here

They told us to come here and wait till our people came for us They
delivered this as if it were a lesson in school Then they sat still
their hands orderly folded on their laps smiling as sweetly as ever

Go away Go away Frau Ebermann shrieked

You called said Anna entering

No Go away Go away

Very good old cat said the maid under her breath Next time you
may call and she returned to her friend in the kitchen

I ask youask you please to go away Frau Ebermann pleaded Go to
my Anna through that door and she will give you cakes and sweeties It
is not kind of you to come into my room and behave so badly

Where else shall we go now the elder girl demanded turning to her
little company They fell into discussion One preferred the broad
street with trees another the railway station but when she suggested
an Emperors palace they agreed with her

We will go then she said and added half apologetically to Frau
Ebermann You see they are so little they like to meet all
the others

What others said Frau Ebermann

The othershundreds and hundreds and thousands and thousands of the
others

That is a lie There cannot be a hundred even much less a thousand
cried Frau Ebermann

So said the girl politely

Yes I tell you and I have very good information I know how it
happened You should have been more careful You should not have run out
to see the horses and guns passing That is how it is done when our
troops pass through My son has written me so

They had clambered down from the sofa and gathered round the bed with
eager interested eyes

Horses and guns going byhow fine some one whispered

Yes yes believe me that is how the accidents to the children
happen You must know yourself that it is true One runs out to look

But I never saw any at all a boy cried sorrowfully Only one noise I
heard That was when Aunt Emmelines house fell down

But listen to me I am telling you One runs out to look because one
is little and cannot see well So one peeps between the mans legs and
thenyou know how close those big horses and guns turn the
cornersthen ones foot slips and one gets run over Thats how it
happens Several times it had happened but not many times certainly
not a hundred perhaps not twenty So you see you must be all Tell
me now that you are all that there are and Anna shall give you
the cakes

Thousands a boy repeated monotonously Then we all come here to
wait till our people come for us

But now we will go away from here The poor lady is tired said the
elder girl plucking his sleeve

Oh you hurt you hurt he cried and burst into tears

What is that for said Frau Ebermann To cry in a room where a poor
lady is sick is very inconsiderate

Oh but look lady said the elder girl

Frau Ebermann looked and saw

Au revoir lady They made their little smiling bows and curtseys
undisturbed by her loud cries Au revoir lady We will wait till our
people come for us

When Anna at last ran in she found her mistress on her knees busily
cleaning the floor with the lace cover from the radiator because she
explained it was all spotted with the blood of five childrenshe was
perfectly certain there could not be more than five in the whole
worldwho had gone away for the moment but were now waiting round the
corner and Anna was to find them and give them cakes to stop the
bleeding while her mistress swept and garnished that Our dear Lord when
He came might find everything as it should be



Mary Postgate



Of Miss Mary Postgate Lady McCausland wrote that she was thoroughly
conscientious tidy companionable and ladylike I am very sorry to
part with her and shall always be interested in her welfare

Miss Fowler engaged her on this recommendation and to her surprise for
she had had experience of companions found that it was true Miss
Fowler was nearer sixty than fifty at the time but though she needed
care she did not exhaust her attendants vitality On the contrary she
gave out stimulatingly and with reminiscences Her father had been a
minor Court official in the days when the Great Exhibition of  had
just set its seal on Civilisation made perfect Some of Miss Fowlers
tales none the less were not always for the young Mary was not young
and though her speech was as colourless as her eyes or her hair she was
never shocked She listened unflinchingly to every one said at the end
How interesting or How shocking as the case might be and never
again referred to it for she prided herself on a trained mind which
did not dwell on these things She was too a treasure at domestic
accounts for which the village tradesmen with their weekly books
loved her not Otherwise she had no enemies provoked no jealousy even
among the plainest neither gossip nor slander had ever been traced to
her she supplied the odd place at the Rectors or the Doctors table at
half an hours notice she was a sort of public aunt to very many small
children of the village street whose parents while accepting
everything would have been swift to resent what they called
patronage she served on the Village Nursing Committee as Miss
Fowlers nominee when Miss Fowler was crippled by rheumatoid arthritis
and came out of six months fortnightly meetings equally respected by
all the cliques

And when Fate threw Miss Fowlers nephew an unlovely orphan of eleven
on Miss Fowlers hands Mary Postgate stood to her share of the business
of education as practised in private and public schools She checked
printed clotheslists and unitemised bills of extras wrote to Head and
House masters matrons nurses and doctors and grieved or rejoiced over
halfterm reports Young Wyndham Fowler repaid her in his holidays by
calling her Gatepost Postey or Packthread by thumping her
between her narrow shoulders or by chasing her bleating round the
garden her large mouth open her large nose high in air at a
stiffnecked shamble very like a camels Later on he filled the house
with clamour argument and harangues as to his personal needs likes
and dislikes and the limitations of you women reducing Mary to tears
of physical fatigue or when he chose to be humorous of helpless
laughter At crises which multiplied as he grew older she was his
ambassadress and his interpretress to Miss Fowler who had no large
sympathy with the young a vote in his interest at the councils on his
future his sewingwoman strictly accountable for mislaid boots and
garments always his butt and his slave

And when he decided to become a solicitor and had entered an office in
London when his greeting had changed from Hullo Postey you old
beast to Mornin Packthread there came a war which unlike all wars
that Mary could remember did not stay decently outside England and in
the newspapers but intruded on the lives of people whom she knew As
she said to Miss Fowler it was most vexatious It took the Rectors
son who was going into business with his elder brother it took the
Colonels nephew on the eve of fruitfarming in Canada it took Mrs
Grants son who his mother said was devoted to the ministry and very
early indeed it took Wynn Fowler who announced on a postcard that he
had joined the Flying Corps and wanted a cardigan waistcoat

He must go and he must have the waistcoat said Miss Fowler So Mary
got the propersized needles and wool while Miss Fowler told the men of
her establishmenttwo gardeners and an odd man aged sixtythat those
who could join the Army had better do so The gardeners left Cheape
the odd man stayed on and was promoted to the gardeners cottage The
cook scorning to be limited in luxuries also left after a spirited
scene with Miss Fowler and took the housemaid with her Miss Fowler
gazetted Nellie Cheapes seventeenyearold daughter to the vacant
post Mrs Cheape to the rank of cook with occasional cleaning bouts
and the reduced establishment moved forward smoothly

Wynn demanded an increase in his allowance Miss Fowler who always
looked facts in the face said He must have it The chances are he
wont live long to draw it and if three hundred makes him happy

Wynn was grateful and came over in his tightbuttoned uniform to say
so His training centre was not thirty miles away and his talk was so
technical that it had to be explained by charts of the various types of
machines He gave Mary such a chart

And youd better study it Postey he said Youll be seeing a lot of
em soon So Mary studied the chart but when Wynn next arrived to
swell and exalt himself before his womenfolk she failed badly in
crossexamination and he rated her as in the old days

You look more or less like a human being he said in his new Service
voice You must have had a brain at some time in your past What have
you done with it Where dyou keep it A sheep would know more than you
do Postey Youre lamentable You are less use than an empty tin can
you dowey old cassowary

I suppose thats how your superior officer talks to you said Miss
Fowler from her chair

But Postey doesnt mind Wynn replied Do you Packthread

Why Was Wynn saying anything I shall get this right next time you
come she muttered and knitted her pale brows again over the diagrams
of Taubes Farmans and Zeppelins

In a few weeks the mere land and sea battles which she read to Miss
Fowler after breakfast passed her like idle breath Her heart and her
interest were high in the air with Wynn who had finished rolling
whatever that might be and had gone on from a taxi to a machine more
or less his own One morning it circled over their very chimneys
alighted on Veggs Heath almost outside the garden gate and Wynn came
in blue with cold shouting for food He and she drew Miss Fowlers
bathchair as they had often done along the Heath footpath to look at
the biplane Mary observed that it smelt very badly

Postey I believe you think with your nose said Wynn I know you
dont with your mind Now what types that

Ill go and get the chart said Mary

Youre hopeless You havent the mental capacity of a white mouse he
cried and explained the dials and the sockets for bombdropping till it
was time to mount and ride the wet clouds once more

Ah said Mary as the stinking thing flared upward Wait till our
Flying Corps gets to work Wynn says its much safer than in the
trenches

I wonder said Miss Fowler Tell Cheape to come and tow me home
again

Its all downhill I can do it said Mary if you put the brake on
She laid her lean self against the pushingbar and home they trundled

Now be careful you arent heated and catch a chill said overdressed
Miss Fowler

Nothing makes me perspire said Mary As she bumped the chair under
the porch she straightened her long back The exertion had given her a
colour and the wind had loosened a wisp of hair across her forehead
Miss Fowler glanced at her

What do you ever think of Mary she demanded suddenly

Oh Wynn says he wants another three pairs of stockingsas thick as we
can make them

Yes But I mean the things that women think about Here you are more
than forty

Fortyfour said truthful Mary

Well

Well Mary offered Miss Fowler her shoulder as usual

And youve been with me ten years now

Lets see said Mary Wynn was eleven when he came Hes twenty now
and I came two years before that It must be eleven

Eleven And youve never told me anything that matters in all that
while Looking back it seems to me that Ive done all the talking

Im afraid Im not much of a conversationalist As Wynn says I havent
the mind Let me take your hat

Miss Fowler moving stiffly from the hip stamped her rubbertipped
stick on the tiled hall floor Mary arent you anything except a
companion Would you ever have been anything except a companion

Mary hung up the garden hat on its proper peg No she said after
consideration I dont imagine I ever should But Ive no imagination
Im afraid

She fetched Miss Fowler her elevenoclock glass of Contrexville

That was the wet December when it rained six inches to the month and
the women went abroad as little as might be Wynns flying chariot
visited them several times and for two mornings he had warned her by
postcard Mary heard the thresh of his propellers at dawn The second
time she ran to the window and stared at the whitening sky A little
blur passed overhead She lifted her lean arms towards it

That evening at six oclock there came an announcement in an official
envelope that Second Lieutenant W Fowler had been killed during a trial
flight Death was instantaneous She read it and carried it to
Miss Fowler

I never expected anything else said Miss Fowler but Im sorry it
happened before he had done anything

The room was whirling round Mary Postgate but she found herself quite
steady in the midst of it

Yes she said Its a great pity he didnt die in action after he had
killed somebody

He was killed instantly Thats one comfort Miss Fowler went on

But Wynn says the shock of a fall kills a man at oncewhatever happens
to the tanks quoted Mary

The room was coming to rest now She heard Miss Fowler say impatiently
But why cant we cry Mary and herself replying Theres nothing to
cry for He has done his duty as much as Mrs Grants son did

And when he died she came and cried all the morning said Miss
Fowler This only makes me feel tiredterribly tired Will you help me
to bed please MaryAnd I think Id like the hotwater bottle

So Mary helped her and sat beside talking of Wynn in his riotous youth

I believe said Miss Fowler suddenly that old people and young
people slip from under a stroke like this The middleaged feel
it most

I expect thats true said Mary rising Im going to put away the
things in his room now Shall we wear mourning

Certainly not said Miss Fowler Except of course at the funeral I
cant go You will I want you to arrange about his being buried here
What a blessing it didnt happen at Salisbury

Every one from the Authorities of the Flying Corps to the Rector was
most kind and sympathetic Mary found herself for the moment in a world
where bodies were in the habit of being despatched by all sorts of
conveyances to all sorts of places And at the funeral two young men in
buttonedup uniforms stood beside the grave and spoke to her afterwards

Youre Miss Postgate arent you said one Fowler told me about you
He was a good chapa firstclass fellowa great loss

Great loss growled his companion Were all awfully sorry

How high did he fall from Mary whispered

Pretty nearly four thousand feet I should think didnt he You were
up that day Monkey

All of that the other child replied My bar made three thousand and
I wasnt as high as him by a lot

Then thats all right said Mary Thank you very much

They moved away as Mrs Grant flung herself weeping on Marys flat
chest under the lychgate and cried I know how it feels I know
how it feels

But both his parents are dead Mary returned as she fended her off
Perhaps theyve all met by now she added vaguely as she escaped
towards the coach

Ive thought of that too wailed Mrs Grant but then hell be
practically a stranger to them Quite embarrassing

Mary faithfully reported every detail of the ceremony to Miss Fowler
who when she described Mrs Grants outburst laughed aloud

Oh how Wynn would have enjoyed it He was always utterly unreliable at
funerals Dyou remember And they talked of him again each piecing
out the others gaps And now said Miss Fowler well pull up the
blinds and well have a general tidy That always does us good Have you
seen to Wynns things

Everythingsince he first came said Mary He was never
destructiveeven with his toys

They faced that neat room

It cant be natural not to cry Mary said at last Im so afraid
youll have a reaction

As I told you we old people slip from under the stroke Its you Im
afraid for Have you cried yet

I cant It only makes me angry with the Germans

Thats sheer waste of vitality said Miss Fowler We must live till
the wars finished She opened a full wardrobe Now Ive been
thinking things over This is my plan All his civilian clothes can be
given awayBelgian refugees and so on

Mary nodded Boots collars and gloves

Yes We dont need to keep anything except his cap and belt

They came back yesterday with his Flying Corps clothesMary pointed
to a roll on the little iron bed

Ah but keep his Service things Some one may be glad of them later Do
you remember his sizes

Five feet eight and a half thirtysix inches round the chest But he
told me hes just put on an inch and a half Ill mark it on a label and
tie it on his sleepingbag

So that disposes of that said Miss Fowler tapping the palm of one
hand with the ringed third finger of the other What waste it all is
Well get his old school trunk tomorrow and pack his civilian clothes

And the rest said Mary His books and pictures and the games and the
toysandand the rest

My plan is to burn every single thing said Miss Fowler Then we
shall know where they are and no one can handle them afterwards What do
you think

I think that would be much the best said Mary But theres such a
lot of them

Well burn them in the destructor said Miss Fowler

This was an openair furnace for the consumption of refuse a little
circular fourfoot tower of pierced brick over an iron grating Miss
Fowler had noticed the design in a gardening journal years ago and had
had it built at the bottom of the garden It suited her tidy soul for
it saved unsightly rubbishheaps and the ashes lightened the stiff
clay soil

Mary considered for a moment saw her way clear and nodded again They
spent the evening putting away wellremembered civilian suits
underclothes that Mary had marked and the regiments of very gaudy socks
and ties A second trunk was needed and after that a little
packingcase and it was late next day when Cheape and the local carrier
lifted them to the cart The Rector luckily knew of a friends son
about five feet eight and a half inches high to whom a complete Flying
Corps outfit would be most acceptable and sent his gardeners son down
with a barrow to take delivery of it The cap was hung up in Miss
Fowlers bedroom the belt in Miss Postgates for as Miss Fowler said
they had no desire to make teaparty talk of them

That disposes of that said Miss Fowler Ill leave the rest to
you Mary I cant run up and down the garden Youd better take the big
clothesbasket and get Nellie to help you

I shall take the wheelbarrow and do it myself said Mary and for
once in her life closed her mouth

Miss Fowler in moments of irritation had called Mary deadly
methodical She put on her oldest waterproof and gardeninghat and her
everslipping goloshes for the weather was on the edge of more rain
She gathered firelighters from the kitchen a halfscuttle of coals
and a faggot of brushwood These she wheeled in the barrow down the
mossed paths to the dank little laurel shrubbery where the destructor
stood under the drip of three oaks She climbed the wire fence into the
Rectors glebe just behind and from his tenants rick pulled two large
armfuls of good hay which she spread neatly on the firebars Next
journey by journey passing Miss Fowlers white face at the morningroom
window each time she brought down in the towelcovered clothesbasket
on the wheelbarrow thumbed and used Hentys Marryats Levers
Stevensons Baroness Orczys Garvices schoolbooks and atlases
unrelated piles of the Motor Cyclist the Light Car and catalogues
of Olympia Exhibitions the remnants of a fleet of sailingships from
ninepenny cutters to a threeguinea yacht a prepschool dressinggown
bats from threeandsixpence to twentyfour shillings cricket and
tennis balls disintegrated steam and clockwork locomotives with their
twisted rails a grey and red tin model of a submarine a dumb
gramophone and cracked records golfclubs that had to be broken across
the knee like his walkingsticks and an assegai photographs of
private and public school cricket and football elevens and his OTC
on the line of march kodaks and filmrolls some pewters and one real
silver cup for boxing competitions and Junior Hurdles sheaves of
school photographs Miss Fowlers photograph her own which he had borne
off in fun and good care she took not to ask had never returned a
playbox with a secret drawer a load of flannels belts and jerseys
and a pair of spiked shoes unearthed in the attic a packet of all the
letters that Miss Fowler and she had ever written to him kept for some
absurd reason through all these years a fiveday attempt at a diary
framed pictures of racing motors in full Brooklands career and load
upon load of undistinguishable wreckage of toolboxes rabbithutches
electric batteries tin soldiers fretsaw outfits and jigsaw puzzles

Miss Fowler at the window watched her come and go and said to herself
Marys an old woman I never realised it before

After lunch she recommended her to rest

Im not in the least tired said Mary Ive got it all arranged Im
going to the village at two oclock for some paraffin Nellie hasnt
enough and the walk will do me good

She made one last quest round the house before she started and found
that she had overlooked nothing It began to mist as soon as she had
skirted Veggs Heath where Wynn used to descendit seemed to her that
she could almost hear the beat of his propellers overhead but there was
nothing to see She hoisted her umbrella and lunged into the blind wet
till she had reached the shelter of the empty village As she came out
of Mr Kidds shop with a bottle full of paraffin in her string
shoppingbag she met Nurse Eden the village nurse and fell into talk
with her as usual about the village children They were just parting
opposite the Royal Oak when a gun they fancied was fired
immediately behind the house It was followed by a childs shriek dying
into a wail

Accident said Nurse Eden promptly and dashed through the empty bar
followed by Mary They found Mrs Gerritt the publicans wife who
could only gasp and point to the yard where a little cartlodge was
sliding sideways amid a clatter of tiles Nurse Eden snatched up a sheet
drying before the fire ran out lifted something from the ground and
flung the sheet round it The sheet turned scarlet and half her uniform
too as she bore the load into the kitchen It was little Edna Gerritt
aged nine whom Mary had known since her perambulator days

Am I hurted bad Edna asked and died between Nurse Edens dripping
hands The sheet fell aside and for an instant before she could shut
her eyes Mary saw the ripped and shredded body

Its a wonder she spoke at all said Nurse Eden What in Gods name
was it

A bomb said Mary

One o the Zeppelins

No An aeroplane I thought I heard it on the Heath but I fancied it
was one of ours It must have shut off its engines as it came down
Thats why we didnt notice it

The filthy pigs said Nurse Eden all white and shaken See the
pickle Im in Go and tell Dr Hennis Miss Postgate Nurse looked at
the mother who had dropped face down on the floor Shes only in a
fit Turn her over

Mary heaved Mrs Gerritt right side up and hurried off for the doctor
When she told her tale he asked her to sit down in the surgery till he
got her something

But I dont need it I assure you said she I dont think it would
be wise to tell Miss Fowler about it do you Her heart is so irritable
in this weather

Dr Hennis looked at her admiringly as he packed up his bag

No Dont tell anybody till were sure he said and hastened to the
Royal Oak while Mary went on with the paraffin The village behind
her was as quiet as usual for the news had not yet spread She frowned
a little to herself her large nostrils expanded uglily and from time
to time she muttered a phrase which Wynn who never restrained himself
before his womenfolk had applied to the enemy Bloody pagans They
are bloody pagans But she continued falling back on the teaching
that had made her what she was one mustnt let ones mind dwell on
these things

Before she reached the house Dr Hennis who was also a special
constable overtook her in his car

Oh Miss Postgate he said I wanted to tell you that that accident
at the Royal Oak was due to Gerritts stable tumbling down Its been
dangerous for a long time It ought to have been condemned

I thought I heard an explosion too said Mary

You might have been misled by the beams snapping Ive been looking at
em They were dryrotted through and through Of course as they broke
they would make a noise just like a gun

Yes said Mary politely

Poor little Edna was playing underneath it he went on still holding
her with his eyes and that and the tiles cut her to pieces you see

I saw it said Mary shaking her head I heard it too

Well we cannot be sure Dr Hennis changed his tone completely I
know both you and Nurse Eden Ive been speaking to her are perfectly
trustworthy and I can rely on you not to say anythingyet at least It
is no good to stir up people unless

Oh I never doanyhow said Mary and Dr Hennis went on to the
county town

After all she told herself it might just possibly have been the
collapse of the old stable that had done all those things to poor little
Edna She was sorry she had even hinted at other things but Nurse Eden
was discretion itself By the time she reached home the affair seemed
increasingly remote by its very monstrosity As she came in Miss Fowler
told her that a couple of aeroplanes had passed half an hour ago

I thought I heard them she replied Im going down to the garden
now Ive got the paraffin

Yes butwhat have you got on your boots Theyre soaking wet
Change them at once

Not only did Mary obey but she wrapped the boots in a newspaper and
put them into the string bag with the bottle So armed with the longest
kitchen poker she left

Its raining again was Miss Fowlers last word butI know you
wont be happy till thats disposed of

It wont take long Ive got everything down there and Ive put the
lid on the destructor to keep the wet out

The shrubbery was filling with twilight by the time she had completed
her arrangements and sprinkled the sacrificial oil As she lit the match
that would burn her heart to ashes she heard a groan or a grunt behind
the dense Portugal laurels

Cheape she called impatiently but Cheape with his ancient lumbago
in his comfortable cottage would be the last man to profane the
sanctuary Sheep she concluded and threw in the fusee The pyre went
up in a roar and the immediate flame hastened night around her

How Wynn would have loved this she thought stepping back from the
blaze

By its light she saw half hidden behind a laurel not five paces away a
bareheaded man sitting very stiffly at the foot of one of the oaks A
broken branch lay across his lapone booted leg protruding from beneath
it His head moved ceaselessly from side to side but his body was as
still as the trees trunk He was dressedshe moved sideways to look
more closelyin a uniform something like Wynns with a flap buttoned
across the chest For an instant she had some idea that it might be
one of the young flying men she had met at the funeral But their heads
were dark and glossy This mans was as pale as a babys and so closely
cropped that she could see the disgusting pinky skin beneath His
lips moved

What do you say Mary moved towards him and stooped

Laty Laty Laty he muttered while his hands picked at the dead wet
leaves There was no doubt as to his nationality It made her so angry
that she strode back to the destructor though it was still too hot to
use the poker there Wynns books seemed to be catching well She looked
up at the oak behind the man several of the light upper and two or
three rotten lower branches had broken and scattered their rubbish on
the shrubbery path On the lowest fork a helmet with dependent strings
showed like a birdsnest in the light of a longtongued flame
Evidently this person had fallen through the tree Wynn had told her
that it was quite possible for people to fall out of aeroplanes Wynn
told her too that trees were useful things to break an aviators fall
but in this case the aviator must have been broken or he would have
moved from his queer position He seemed helpless except for his
horrible rolling head On the other hand she could see a pistol case at
his beltand Mary loathed pistols Months ago after reading certain
Belgian reports together she and Miss Fowler had had dealings with
onea huge revolver with flatnosed bullets which latter Wynn said
were forbidden by the rules of war to be used against civilised
enemies Theyre good enough for us Miss Fowler had replied Show
Mary how it works And Wynn laughing at the mere possibility of any
such need had led the craven winking Mary into the Rectors disused
quarry and had shown her how to fire the terrible machine It lay now
in the toplefthand drawer of her toilettablea memento not included
in the burning Wynn would be pleased to see how she was not afraid

She slipped up to the house to get it When she came through the rain
the eyes in the head were alive with expectation The mouth even tried
to smile But at sight of the revolver its corners went down just like
Edna Gerritts A tear trickled from one eye and the head rolled from
shoulder to shoulder as though trying to point out something

Casse Tout casse it whimpered

What do you say said Mary disgustedly keeping well to one side
though only the head moved

Casse it repeated Che me rends Le mdicin Toctor

Nein said she bringing all her small German to bear with the big
pistol Ich haben der todt Kinder gesehn

The head was still Marys hand dropped She had been careful to keep
her finger off the trigger for fear of accidents After a few moments
waiting she returned to the destructor where the flames were falling
and churned up Wynns charring books with the poker Again the head
groaned for the doctor

Stop that said Mary and stamped her foot Stop that you bloody
pagan

The words came quite smoothly and naturally They were Wynns own words
and Wynn was a gentleman who for no consideration on earth would have
torn little Edna into those vividly coloured strips and strings But
this thing hunched under the oaktree had done that thing It was no
question of reading horrors out of newspapers to Miss Fowler Mary had
seen it with her own eyes on the Royal Oak kitchen table She must not
allow her mind to dwell upon it Now Wynn was dead and everything
connected with him was lumping and rustling and tinkling under her busy
poker into red black dust and grey leaves of ash The thing beneath the
oak would die too Mary had seen death more than once She came of a
family that had a knack of dying under as she told Miss Fowler most
distressing circumstances She would stay where she was till she was
entirely satisfied that It was deaddead as dear papa in the late
eighties aunt Mary in eightynine mamma in ninetyone cousin Dick
in ninetyfive Lady McCauslands housemaid in ninetynine Lady
McCauslands sister in nineteen hundred and one Wynn buried five days
ago and Edna Gerritt still waiting for decent earth to hide her As she
thoughther underlip caught up by one faded canine brows knit and
nostrils wideshe wielded the poker with lunges that jarred the grating
at the bottom and careful scrapes round the brickwork above She
looked at her wristwatch It was getting on to halfpast four and the
rain was coming down in earnest Tea would be at five If It did not die
before that time she would be soaked and would have to change
Meantime and this occupied her Wynns things were burning well in
spite of the hissing wet though now and again a bookback with a quite
distinguishable title would be heaved up out of the mass The exercise
of stoking had given her a glow which seemed to reach to the marrow of
her bones She hummedMary never had a voiceto herself She had never
believed in all those advanced viewsthough Miss Fowler herself leaned
a little that wayof womans work in the world but now she saw there
was much to be said for them This for instance was her workwork
which no man least of all Dr Hennis would ever have done A man at
such a crisis would be what Wynn called a sportsman would leave
everything to fetch help and would certainly bring It into the house
Now a womans business was to make a happy home forfor a husband and
children Failing theseit was not a thing one should allow ones mind
to dwell uponbut

Stop it Mary cried once more across the shadows Nein I tell you
Ich haben der todt Kinder gesehn

But it was a fact A woman who had missed these things could still be
usefulmore useful than a man in certain respects She thumped like a
pavior through the settling ashes at the secret thrill of it The rain
was damping the fire but she could feelit was too dark to seethat
her work was done There was a dull red glow at the bottom of the
destructor not enough to char the wooden lid if she slipped it half
over against the driving wet This arranged she leaned on the poker and
waited while an increasing rapture laid hold on her She ceased to
think She gave herself up to feel Her long pleasure was broken by a
sound that she had waited for in agony several times in her life She
leaned forward and listened smiling There could be no mistake She
closed her eyes and drank it in Once it ceased abruptly

Go on she murmured half aloud That isnt the end

Then the end came very distinctly in a lull between two raingusts Mary
Postgate drew her breath short between her teeth and shivered from head
to foot Thats all right said she contentedly and went up to the
house where she scandalised the whole routine by taking a luxurious hot
bath before tea and came down looking as Miss Fowler said when she saw
her lying all relaxed on the other sofa quite handsome




     THE BEGINNINGS

     It was not part of their blood
       It came to them very late
     With long arrears to make good
       When the English began to hate

     They were not easily moved
       They were icy willing to wait
     Till every count should be proved
       Ere the English began to hate

     Their voices were even and low
       Their eyes were level and straight
     There was neither sign nor show
       When the English began to hate

     It was not preached to the crowd
       It was not taught by the State
     No man spoke it aloud
       When the English began to hate

     It was not suddenly bred
       It will not swiftly abate
     Through the chill years ahead
       When Time shall count from the date
       That the English began to hate

keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition
