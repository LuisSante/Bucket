CHAPTER XXXI

WE dasnt stop again at any town for days and days kept right along down
the river  We was down south in the warm weather now and a mighty long
ways from home  We begun to come to trees with Spanish moss on them
hanging down from the limbs like long gray beards  It was the first I
ever see it growing and it made the woods look solemn and dismal  So
now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger and they begun to work
the villages again

First they done a lecture on temperance but they didnt make enough for
them both to get drunk on  Then in another village they started a
dancingschool but they didnt know no more how to dance than a kangaroo
does so the first prance they made the general public jumped in and
pranced them out of town  Another time they tried to go at yellocution
but they didnt yellocute long till the audience got up and give them a
solid good cussing and made them skip out  They tackled missionarying
and mesmerizing and doctoring and telling fortunes and a little of
everything but they couldnt seem to have no luck  So at last they got
just about dead broke and laid around the raft as she floated along
thinking and thinking and never saying nothing by the half a day at a
time and dreadful blue and desperate

And at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together in
the wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a time
Jim and me got uneasy  We didnt like the look of it  We judged they
was studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever  We turned it over
and over and at last we made up our minds they was going to break into
somebodys house or store or was going into the counterfeitmoney
business or something So then we was pretty scared and made up an
agreement that we wouldnt have nothing in the world to do with such
actions and if we ever got the least show we would give them the cold
shake and clear out and leave them behind Well early one morning we hid
the raft in a good safe place about two mile below a little bit of a
shabby village named Pikesville and the king he went ashore and told us
all to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt around to see if
anybody had got any wind of the Royal Nonesuch there yet House to rob
you MEAN says I to myself and when you get through robbing it youll
come back here and wonder what has become of me and Jim and the raftand
youll have to take it out in wondering And he said if he warnt back
by midday the duke and me would know it was all right and we was to come
along

So we stayed where we was  The duke he fretted and sweated around and
was in a mighty sour way  He scolded us for everything and we couldnt
seem to do nothing right he found fault with every little thing
Something was abrewing sure  I was good and glad when midday come and
no king we could have a change anywayand maybe a chance for THE
chance on top of it  So me and the duke went up to the village and
hunted around there for the king and by and by we found him in the back
room of a little low doggery very tight and a lot of loafers
bullyragging him for sport and he acussing and athreatening with all
his might and so tight he couldnt walk and couldnt do nothing to
them  The duke he begun to abuse him for an old fool and the king begun
to sass back and the minute they was fairly at it I lit out and shook
the reefs out of my hind legs and spun down the river road like a deer
for I see our chance and I made up my mind that it would be a long day
before they ever see me and Jim again  I got down there all out of
breath but loaded up with joy and sung out

Set her loose Jim were all right now

But there warnt no answer and nobody come out of the wigwam  Jim was
gone  I set up a shoutand then anotherand then another one and run
this way and that in the woods whooping and screeching but it warnt no
useold Jim was gone  Then I set down and cried I couldnt help it
But I couldnt set still long  Pretty soon I went out on the road
trying to think what I better do and I run across a boy walking and
asked him if hed seen a strange nigger dressed so and so and he says

Yes

Whereabouts says I

Down to Silas Phelps place two mile below here  Hes a runaway
nigger and theyve got him  Was you looking for him

You bet I aint  I run across him in the woods about an hour or two
ago and he said if I hollered hed cut my livers outand told me to lay
down and stay where I was and I done it  Been there ever since afeard
to come out

Well he says you neednt be afeard no more becuz theyve got him
He run off fm down South somers

Its a good job they got him

Well I RECKON  Theres two hunderd dollars reward on him  Its like
picking up money outn the road

Yes it isand I could a had it if Id been big enough I see him
FIRST Who nailed him

It was an old fellowa strangerand he sold out his chance in him for
forty dollars becuz hes got to go up the river and cant wait  Think
o that now  You bet ID wait if it was seven year

Thats me every time says I  But maybe his chance aint worth no
more than that if hell sell it so cheap  Maybe theres something aint
straight about it

But it IS thoughstraight as a string  I see the handbill myself  It
tells all about him to a dotpaints him like a picture and tells the
plantation hes frum below NewrLEANS  NosirreeBOB they aint no
trouble bout THAT speculation you bet you  Say gimme a chaw tobacker
wont ye

I didnt have none so he left  I went to the raft and set down in the
wigwam to think  But I couldnt come to nothing  I thought till I wore
my head sore but I couldnt see no way out of the trouble  After all
this long journey and after all wed done for them scoundrels here it
was all come to nothing everything all busted up and ruined because
they could have the heart to serve Jim such a trick as that and make him
a slave again all his life and amongst strangers too for forty dirty
dollars

Once I said to myself it would be a thousand times better for Jim to be a
slave at home where his family was as long as hed GOT to be a slave
and so Id better write a letter to Tom Sawyer and tell him to tell Miss
Watson where he was  But I soon give up that notion for two things
shed be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulness for
leaving her and so shed sell him straight down the river again and if
she didnt everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger and theyd
make Jim feel it all the time and so hed feel ornery and disgraced
And then think of ME  It would get all around that Huck Finn helped a
nigger to get his freedom and if I was ever to see anybody from that
town again Id be ready to get down and lick his boots for shame  Thats
just the way  a person does a lowdown thing and then he dont want to
take no consequences of it Thinks as long as he can hide it aint no
disgrace  That was my fix exactly  The more I studied about this the
more my conscience went to grinding me and the more wicked and lowdown
and ornery I got to feeling And at last when it hit me all of a sudden
that here was the plain hand of Providence slapping me in the face and
letting me know my wickedness was being watched all the time from up
there in heaven whilst I was stealing a poor old womans nigger that
hadnt ever done me no harm and now was showing me theres One thats
always on the lookout and aint agoing to allow no such miserable
doings to go only just so fur and no further I most dropped in my tracks
I was so scared  Well I tried the best I could to kinder soften it up
somehow for myself by saying I was brung up wicked and so I warnt so
much to blame but something inside of me kept saying There was the
Sundayschool you could a gone to it and if youd a done it theyd a
learnt you there that people that acts as Id been acting about that
nigger goes to everlasting fire

It made me shiver  And I about made up my mind to pray and see if I
couldnt try to quit being the kind of a boy I was and be better  So I
kneeled down  But the words wouldnt come  Why wouldnt they  It
warnt no use to try and hide it from Him  Nor from ME neither  I
knowed very well why they wouldnt come  It was because my heart warnt
right it was because I warnt square it was because I was playing
double  I was letting ON to give up sin but away inside of me I was
holding on to the biggest one of all  I was trying to make my mouth SAY
I would do the right thing and the clean thing and go and write to that
niggers owner and tell where he was but deep down in me I knowed it was
a lie and He knowed it  You cant pray a lieI found that out

So I was full of trouble full as I could be and didnt know what to do
At last I had an idea and I says Ill go and write the letterand then
see if I can pray  Why it was astonishing the way I felt as light as a
feather right straight off and my troubles all gone  So I got a piece
of paper and a pencil all glad and excited and set down and wrote

Miss Watson your runaway nigger Jim is down here two mile below
Pikesville and Mr Phelps has got him and he will give him up for the
reward if you send

HUCK FINN

I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever
felt so in my life and I knowed I could pray now  But I didnt do it
straight off but laid the paper down and set there thinkingthinking
how good it was all this happened so and how near I come to being lost
and going to hell  And went on thinking  And got to thinking over our
trip down the river and I see Jim before me all the time  in the day
and in the nighttime sometimes moonlight sometimes storms and we
afloating along talking and singing and laughing  But somehow I
couldnt seem to strike no places to harden me against him but only the
other kind  Id see him standing my watch on top of hisn stead of
calling me so I could go on sleeping and see him how glad he was when I
come back out of the fog and when I come to him again in the swamp up
there where the feud was and suchlike times and would always call me
honey and pet me and do everything he could think of for me and how
good he always was and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling
the men we had smallpox aboard and he was so grateful and said I was
the best friend old Jim ever had in the world and the ONLY one hes got
now and then I happened to look around and see that paper

It was a close place  I took it up and held it in my hand  I was
atrembling because Id got to decide forever betwixt two things and
I knowed it  I studied a minute sort of holding my breath and then
says to myself

All right then Ill GO to helland tore it up

It was awful thoughts and awful words but they was said  And I let them
stay said and never thought no more about reforming  I shoved the whole
thing out of my head and said I would take up wickedness again which
was in my line being brung up to it and the other warnt  And for a
starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again and if I
could think up anything worse I would do that too because as long as I
was in and in for good I might as well go the whole hog

Then I set to thinking over how to get at it and turned over some
considerable many ways in my mind and at last fixed up a plan that
suited me  So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was down
the river a piece and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with my
raft and went for it and hid it there and then turned in  I slept the
night through and got up before it was light and had my breakfast and
put on my store clothes and tied up some others and one thing or another
in a bundle and took the canoe and cleared for shore  I landed below
where I judged was Phelpss place and hid my bundle in the woods and
then filled up the canoe with water and loaded rocks into her and sunk
her where I could find her again when I wanted her about a quarter of a
mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank

Then I struck up the road and when I passed the mill I see a sign on it
Phelpss Sawmill and when I come to the farmhouses two or three
hundred yards further along I kept my eyes peeled but didnt see nobody
around though it was good daylight now  But I didnt mind because I
didnt want to see nobody just yetI only wanted to get the lay of the
land According to my plan I was going to turn up there from the
village not from below  So I just took a look and shoved along
straight for town Well the very first man I see when I got there was
the duke  He was sticking up a bill for the Royal Nonesuchthreenight
performancelike that other time  They had the cheek them frauds  I
was right on him before I could shirk  He looked astonished and says

HelLO  Whered YOU come from  Then he says kind of glad and eager
Wheres the raftgot her in a good place

I says

Why thats just what I was going to ask your grace

Then he didnt look so joyful and says

What was your idea for asking ME he says

Well I says when I see the king in that doggery yesterday I says to
myself we cant get him home for hours till hes soberer so I went
aloafing around town to put in the time and wait  A man up and offered
me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch a
sheep and so I went along but when we was dragging him to the boat and
the man left me aholt of the rope and went behind him to shove him
along he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run and we after
him  We didnt have no dog and so we had to chase him all over the
country till we tired him out  We never got him till dark then we
fetched him over and I started down for the raft  When I got there and
see it was gone I says to myself Theyve got into trouble and had to
leave and theyve took my nigger which is the only nigger Ive got in
the world and now Im in a strange country and aint got no property no
more nor nothing and no way to make my living so I set down and
cried  I slept in the woods all night  But what DID become of the raft
thenand Jimpoor Jim

Blamed if I knowthat is whats become of the raft  That old fool had
made a trade and got forty dollars and when we found him in the doggery
the loafers had matched halfdollars with him and got every cent but what
hed spent for whisky and when I got him home late last night and found
the raft gone we said That little rascal has stole our raft and shook
us and run off down the river

I wouldnt shake my NIGGER would Ithe only nigger I had in the
world and the only property

We never thought of that  Fact is I reckon wed come to consider him
OUR nigger yes we did consider him sogoodness knows we had trouble
enough for him  So when we see the raft was gone and we flat broke
there warnt anything for it but to try the Royal Nonesuch another shake
And Ive pegged along ever since dry as a powderhorn  Wheres that ten
cents Give it here

I had considerable money so I give him ten cents but begged him to
spend it for something to eat and give me some because it was all the
money I had and I hadnt had nothing to eat since yesterday  He never
said nothing  The next minute he whirls on me and says

Do you reckon that nigger would blow on us  Wed skin him if he done
that

How can he blow  Haint he run off

No  That old fool sold him and never divided with me and the moneys
gone

SOLD him  I says and begun to cry why he was MY nigger and that
was my money  Where is heI want my nigger

Well you cant GET your nigger thats allso dry up your blubbering
Looky heredo you think YOUD venture to blow on us  Blamed if I think
Id trust you  Why if you WAS to blow on us

He stopped but I never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyes before
I went on awhimpering and says

I dont want to blow on nobody and I aint got no time to blow nohow
I got to turn out and find my nigger

He looked kinder bothered and stood there with his bills fluttering on
his arm thinking and wrinkling up his forehead  At last he says

Ill tell you something  We got to be here three days  If youll
promise you wont blow and wont let the nigger blow Ill tell you
where to find him

So I promised and he says

A farmer by the name of Silas Ph and then he stopped  You see he
started to tell me the truth but when he stopped that way and begun to
study and think again I reckoned he was changing his mind  And so he
was He wouldnt trust me he wanted to make sure of having me out of the
way the whole three days  So pretty soon he says

The man that bought him is named Abram FosterAbram G Fosterand he
lives forty mile back here in the country on the road to Lafayette

All right I says I can walk it in three days  And Ill start this
very afternoon

No you wont youll start NOW and dont you lose any time about it
neither nor do any gabbling by the way  Just keep a tight tongue in
your head and move right along and then you wont get into trouble with
US dye hear

That was the order I wanted and that was the one I played for  I wanted
to be left free to work my plans

So clear out he says and you can tell Mr Foster whatever you want
to Maybe you can get him to believe that Jim IS your niggersome idiots
dont require documentsleastways Ive heard theres such down South
here  And when you tell him the handbill and the rewards bogus maybe
hell believe you when you explain to him what the idea was for getting
em out  Go long now and tell him anything you want to but mind you
dont work your jaw any BETWEEN here and there

So I left and struck for the back country  I didnt look around but I
kinder felt like he was watching me  But I knowed I could tire him out
at that  I went straight out in the country as much as a mile before I
stopped then I doubled back through the woods towards Phelps  I
reckoned I better start in on my plan straight off without fooling
around because I wanted to stop Jims mouth till these fellows could get
away  I didnt want no trouble with their kind  Id seen all I wanted
to of them and wanted to get entirely shut of them




CHAPTER XXXII

WHEN I got there it was all still and Sundaylike and hot and sunshiny
the hands was gone to the fields and there was them kind of faint
dronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem so lonesome and
like everybodys dead and gone and if a breeze fans along and quivers
the leaves it makes you feel mournful because you feel like its spirits
whisperingspirits thats been dead ever so many yearsand you always
think theyre talking about YOU  As a general thing it makes a body wish
HE was dead too and done with it all

Phelps was one of these little onehorse cotton plantations and they
all look alike  A rail fence round a twoacre yard a stile made out of
logs sawed off and upended in steps like barrels of a different length
to climb over the fence with and for the women to stand on when they are
going to jump on to a horse some sickly grasspatches in the big yard
but mostly it was bare and smooth like an old hat with the nap rubbed
off big double loghouse for the white folkshewed logs with the
chinks stopped up with mud or mortar and these mudstripes been
whitewashed some time or another roundlog kitchen with a big broad
open but roofed passage joining it to the house log smokehouse back of
the kitchen three little log niggercabins in a row tother side the
smokehouse one little hut all by itself away down against the back
fence and some outbuildings down a piece the other side ashhopper and
big kettle to bile soap in by the little hut bench by the kitchen door
with bucket of water and a gourd hound asleep there in the sun more
hounds asleep round about about three shade trees away off in a corner
some currant bushes and gooseberry bushes in one place by the fence
outside of the fence a garden and a watermelon patch then the cotton
fields begins and after the fields the woods

I went around and clumb over the back stile by the ashhopper and
started for the kitchen  When I got a little ways I heard the dim hum of
a spinningwheel wailing along up and sinking along down again and then
I knowed for certain I wished I was deadfor that IS the lonesomest
sound in the whole world

I went right along not fixing up any particular plan but just trusting
to Providence to put the right words in my mouth when the time come for
Id noticed that Providence always did put the right words in my mouth if
I left it alone

When I got halfway first one hound and then another got up and went for
me and of course I stopped and faced them and kept still  And such
another powwow as they made  In a quarter of a minute I was a kind of a
hub of a wheel as you may sayspokes made out of dogscircle of
fifteen of them packed together around me with their necks and noses
stretched up towards me abarking and howling and more acoming you
could see them sailing over fences and around corners from everywheres

A nigger woman come tearing out of the kitchen with a rollingpin in her
hand singing out Begone YOU Tige you Spot begone sah and she
fetched first one and then another of them a clip and sent them howling
and then the rest followed and the next second half of them come back
wagging their tails around me and making friends with me  There aint
no harm in a hound nohow

And behind the woman comes a little nigger girl and two little nigger
boys without anything on but towlinen shirts and they hung on to their
mothers gown and peeped out from behind her at me bashful the way
they always do  And here comes the white woman running from the house
about fortyfive or fifty year old bareheaded and her spinningstick in
her hand and behind her comes her little white children acting the same
way the little niggers was going  She was smiling all over so she could
hardly standand says

Its YOU at lastAINT it

I out with a Yesm before I thought

She grabbed me and hugged me tight and then gripped me by both hands and
shook and shook and the tears come in her eyes and run down over and
she couldnt seem to hug and shake enough and kept saying You dont
look as much like your mother as I reckoned you would but law sakes I
dont care for that Im so glad to see you  Dear dear it does seem
like I could eat you up  Children its your cousin Tomtell him
howdy

But they ducked their heads and put their fingers in their mouths and
hid behind her  So she run on

Lize hurry up and get him a hot breakfast right awayor did you get
your breakfast on the boat

I said I had got it on the boat  So then she started for the house
leading me by the hand and the children tagging after  When we got
there she set me down in a splitbottomed chair and set herself down on
a little low stool in front of me holding both of my hands and says

Now I can have a GOOD look at you and lawsame Ive been hungry for
it a many and a many a time all these long years and its come at last
We been expecting you a couple of days and more  What kep youboat
get aground

Yesmshe

Dont say yesmsay Aunt Sally  Whered she get aground

I didnt rightly know what to say because I didnt know whether the boat
would be coming up the river or down  But I go a good deal on instinct
and my instinct said she would be coming upfrom down towards Orleans
That didnt help me much though for I didnt know the names of bars
down that way  I see Id got to invent a bar or forget the name of the
one we got aground onorNow I struck an idea and fetched it out

It warnt the groundingthat didnt keep us back but a little  We
blowed out a cylinderhead

Good gracious anybody hurt

Nom  Killed a nigger

Well its lucky because sometimes people do get hurt  Two years ago
last Christmas your uncle Silas was coming up from Newrleans on the old
Lally Rook and she blowed out a cylinderhead and crippled a man  And I
think he died afterwards  He was a Baptist  Your uncle Silas knowed a
family in Baton Rouge that knowed his people very well  Yes I remember
now he DID die  Mortification set in and they had to amputate him
But it didnt save him  Yes it was mortificationthat was it  He
turned blue all over and died in the hope of a glorious resurrection
They say he was a sight to look at  Your uncles been up to the town
every day to fetch you And hes gone again not moren an hour ago
hell be back any minute now You must a met him on the road didnt
youoldish man with a

No I didnt see nobody Aunt Sally  The boat landed just at daylight
and I left my baggage on the wharfboat and went looking around the town
and out a piece in the country to put in the time and not get here too
soon and so I come down the back way

Whod you give the baggage to

Nobody

Why child it ll be stole

Not where I hid it I reckon it wont I says

Howd you get your breakfast so early on the boat

It was kinder thin ice but I says

The captain see me standing around and told me I better have something
to eat before I went ashore so he took me in the texas to the officers
lunch and give me all I wanted

I was getting so uneasy I couldnt listen good  I had my mind on the
children all the time I wanted to get them out to one side and pump them
a little and find out who I was  But I couldnt get no show Mrs
Phelps kept it up and run on so  Pretty soon she made the cold chills
streak all down my back because she says

But here were arunning on this way and you haint told me a word
about Sis nor any of them  Now Ill rest my works a little and you
start up yourn just tell me EVERYTHINGtell me all about m all every
one of m and how they are and what theyre doing and what they told
you to tell me and every last thing you can think of

Well I see I was up a stumpand up it good  Providence had stood by me
this fur all right but I was hard and tight aground now  I see it
warnt a bit of use to try to go aheadId got to throw up my hand  So
I says to myself heres another place where I got to resk the truth  I
opened my mouth to begin but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind the
bed and says

Here he comes  Stick your head down lowerthere thatll do you cant
be seen now  Dont you let on youre here  Ill play a joke on him
Children dont you say a word

I see I was in a fix now  But it warnt no use to worry there warnt
nothing to do but just hold still and try and be ready to stand from
under when the lightning struck

I had just one little glimpse of the old gentleman when he come in then
the bed hid him  Mrs Phelps she jumps for him and says

Has he come

No says her husband

GoodNESS gracious she says what in the warld can have become of
him

I cant imagine says the old gentleman and I must say it makes me
dreadful uneasy

Uneasy she says Im ready to go distracted  He MUST a come and
youve missed him along the road  I KNOW its sosomething tells me
so

Why Sally I COULDNT miss him along the roadYOU know that

But oh dear dear what WILL Sis say  He must a come  You must a
missed him  He

Oh dont distress me any moren Im already distressed  I dont know
what in the world to make of it  Im at my wits end and I dont mind
acknowledging t Im right down scared  But theres no hope that hes
come for he COULDNT come and me miss him  Sally its terriblejust
terriblesomethings happened to the boat sure

Why Silas  Look yonderup the roadaint that somebody coming

He sprung to the window at the head of the bed and that give Mrs Phelps
the chance she wanted  She stooped down quick at the foot of the bed and
give me a pull and out I come and when he turned back from the window
there she stood abeaming and asmiling like a house afire and I
standing pretty meek and sweaty alongside  The old gentleman stared and
says

Why whos that

Who do you reckon t is

I haint no idea  Who IS it

Its TOM SAWYER

By jings I most slumped through the floor  But there warnt no time to
swap knives the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook and kept on
shaking and all the time how the woman did dance around and laugh and
cry and then how they both did fire off questions about Sid and Mary
and the rest of the tribe

But if they was joyful it warnt nothing to what I was for it was like
being born again I was so glad to find out who I was  Well they froze
to me for two hours and at last when my chin was so tired it couldnt
hardly go any more I had told them more about my familyI mean the
Sawyer familythan ever happened to any six Sawyer families  And I
explained all about how we blowed out a cylinderhead at the mouth of
White River and it took us three days to fix it  Which was all right
and worked firstrate because THEY didnt know but what it would take
three days to fix it  If Id a called it a bolthead it would a done just
as well

Now I was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side and pretty
uncomfortable all up the other  Being Tom Sawyer was easy and
comfortable and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by I hear a
steamboat coughing along down the river  Then I says to myself spose
Tom Sawyer comes down on that boat  And spose he steps in here any
minute and sings out my name before I can throw him a wink to keep
quiet

Well I couldnt HAVE it that way it wouldnt do at all  I must go up
the road and waylay him  So I told the folks I reckoned I would go up to
the town and fetch down my baggage  The old gentleman was for going
along with me but I said no I could drive the horse myself and I
druther he wouldnt take no trouble about me




CHAPTER XXXIII

SO I started for town in the wagon and when I was halfway I see a wagon
coming and sure enough it was Tom Sawyer and I stopped and waited till
he come along  I says Hold on and it stopped alongside and his mouth
opened up like a trunk and stayed so and he swallowed two or three
times like a person thats got a dry throat and then says

I haint ever done you no harm  You know that  So then what you want
to come back and hant ME for

I says

I haint come backI haint been GONE

When he heard my voice it righted him up some but he warnt quite
satisfied yet  He says

Dont you play nothing on me because I wouldnt on you  Honest injun
you aint a ghost

Honest injun I aint I says

WellIIwell that ought to settle it of course but I cant
somehow seem to understand it no way  Looky here warnt you ever
murdered AT ALL

No  I warnt ever murdered at allI played it on them  You come in
here and feel of me if you dont believe me

So he done it and it satisfied him and he was that glad to see me again
he didnt know what to do  And he wanted to know all about it right off
because it was a grand adventure and mysterious and so it hit him where
he lived  But I said leave it alone till by and by and told his driver
to wait and we drove off a little piece and I told him the kind of a
fix I was in and what did he reckon we better do  He said let him
alone a minute and dont disturb him  So he thought and thought and
pretty soon he says

Its all right Ive got it  Take my trunk in your wagon and let on
its yourn and you turn back and fool along slow so as to get to the
house about the time you ought to and Ill go towards town a piece and
take a fresh start and get there a quarter or a half an hour after you
and you neednt let on to know me at first

I says

All right but wait a minute  Theres one more thinga thing that
NOBODY dont know but me  And that is theres a nigger here that Im
atrying to steal out of slavery and his name is JIMold Miss Watsons
Jim

He says

What  Why Jim is

He stopped and went to studying  I says

I know what youll say  Youll say its dirty lowdown business but
what if it is  Im low down and Im agoing to steal him and I want
you keep mum and not let on  Will you

His eye lit up and he says

Ill HELP you steal him

Well I let go all holts then like I was shot  It was the most
astonishing speech I ever heardand Im bound to say Tom Sawyer fell
considerable in my estimation  Only I couldnt believe it  Tom Sawyer a
NIGGERSTEALER

Oh shucks  I says youre joking

I aint joking either

Well then I says joking or no joking if you hear anything said
about a runaway nigger dont forget to remember that YOU dont know
nothing about him and I dont know nothing about him

Then we took the trunk and put it in my wagon and he drove off his way
and I drove mine  But of course I forgot all about driving slow on
accounts of being glad and full of thinking so I got home a heap too
quick for that length of a trip  The old gentleman was at the door and
he says

Why this is wonderful  Whoever would a thought it was in that mare to
do it  I wish wed a timed her  And she haint sweated a hairnot a
hair Its wonderful  Why I wouldnt take a hundred dollars for that
horse nowI wouldnt honest and yet Id a sold her for fifteen
before and thought twas all she was worth

Thats all he said  He was the innocentest best old soul I ever see
But it warnt surprising because he warnt only just a farmer he was a
preacher too and had a little onehorse log church down back of the
plantation which he built it himself at his own expense for a church
and schoolhouse and never charged nothing for his preaching and it was
worth it too  There was plenty other farmerpreachers like that and
done the same way down South

In about half an hour Toms wagon drove up to the front stile and Aunt
Sally she see it through the window because it was only about fifty
yards and says

Why theres somebody come  I wonder who tis  Why I do believe its
a stranger  Jimmy thats one of the children run and tell Lize to
put on another plate for dinner

Everybody made a rush for the front door because of course a stranger
dont come EVERY year and so he lays over the yallerfever for
interest when he does come  Tom was over the stile and starting for the
house the wagon was spinning up the road for the village and we was all
bunched in the front door  Tom had his store clothes on and an
audienceand that was always nuts for Tom Sawyer  In them circumstances
it warnt no trouble to him to throw in an amount of style that was
suitable  He warnt a boy to meeky along up that yard like a sheep no
he come cam and important like the ram  When he got afront of us he
lifts his hat ever so gracious and dainty like it was the lid of a box
that had butterflies asleep in it and he didnt want to disturb them and
says

Mr Archibald Nichols I presume

No my boy says the old gentleman Im sorry to say t your driver
has deceived you Nicholss place is down a matter of three mile more
Come in come in

Tom he took a look back over his shoulder and says Too latehes out
of sight

Yes hes gone my son and you must come in and eat your dinner with
us and then well hitch up and take you down to Nicholss

Oh I CANT make you so much trouble I couldnt think of it  Ill walk
I dont mind the distance

But we wont LET you walkit wouldnt be Southern hospitality to do it
Come right in

Oh DO says Aunt Sally it aint a bit of trouble to us not a bit in
the world  You must stay  Its a long dusty three mile and we cant
let you walk  And besides Ive already told em to put on another
plate when I see you coming so you mustnt disappoint us  Come right in
and make yourself at home

So Tom he thanked them very hearty and handsome and let himself be
persuaded and come in and when he was in he said he was a stranger from
Hicksville Ohio and his name was William Thompsonand he made another
bow

Well he run on and on and on making up stuff about Hicksville and
everybody in it he could invent and I getting a little nervious and
wondering how this was going to help me out of my scrape and at last
still talking along he reached over and kissed Aunt Sally right on the
mouth and then settled back again in his chair comfortable and was
going on talking but she jumped up and wiped it off with the back of her
hand and says

You owdacious puppy

He looked kind of hurt and says

Im surprised at you mam

Youre srpWhy what do you reckon I am  Ive a good notion to take
andSay what do you mean by kissing me

He looked kind of humble and says

I didnt mean nothing mam  I didnt mean no harm  IIthought
youd like it

Why you born fool  She took up the spinning stick and it looked like
it was all she could do to keep from giving him a crack with it  What
made you think Id like it

Well I dont know  Only theytheytold me you would

THEY told you I would  Whoever told yous ANOTHER lunatic  I never
heard the beat of it  Whos THEY

Why everybody  They all said so mam

It was all she could do to hold in and her eyes snapped and her fingers
worked like she wanted to scratch him and she says

Whos everybody  Out with their names or therll be an idiot short

He got up and looked distressed and fumbled his hat and says

Im sorry and I warnt expecting it  They told me to  They all told
me to  They all said kiss her and said shed like it  They all said
itevery one of them  But Im sorry mam and I wont do it no more
I wont honest

You wont wont you  Well I shd RECKON you wont

Nom Im honest about it I wont ever do it againtill you ask me

Till I ASK you  Well I never see the beat of it in my born days  I
lay youll be the Methusalemnumskull of creation before ever I ask you
or the likes of you

Well he says it does surprise me so  I cant make it out somehow
They said you would and I thought you would  But He stopped and
looked around slow like he wished he could run across a friendly eye
somewheres and fetched up on the old gentlemans and says Didnt YOU
think shed like me to kiss her sir

Why no IIwell no I blieve I didnt

Then he looks on around the same way to me and says

Tom didnt YOU think Aunt Sally d open out her arms and say Sid
Sawyer

My land she says breaking in and jumping for him you impudent young
rascal to fool a body so and was going to hug him but he fended her
off and says

No not till youve asked me first

So she didnt lose no time but asked him and hugged him and kissed him
over and over again and then turned him over to the old man and he took
what was left  And after they got a little quiet again she says

Why dear me I never see such a surprise  We warnt looking for YOU at
all but only Tom  Sis never wrote to me about anybody coming but him

Its because it warnt INTENDED for any of us to come but Tom he says
but I begged and begged and at the last minute she let me come too
so coming down the river me and Tom thought it would be a firstrate
surprise for him to come here to the house first and for me to by and by
tag along and drop in and let on to be a stranger  But it was a
mistake Aunt Sally  This aint no healthy place for a stranger to
come

Nonot impudent whelps Sid  You ought to had your jaws boxed I
haint been so put out since I dont know when  But I dont care I
dont mind the termsId be willing to stand a thousand such jokes to
have you here Well to think of that performance  I dont deny it I
was most putrified with astonishment when you give me that smack

We had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house and the
kitchen and there was things enough on that table for seven families
and all hot too none of your flabby tough meat thats laid in a
cupboard in a damp cellar all night and tastes like a hunk of old cold
cannibal in the morning  Uncle Silas he asked a pretty long blessing
over it but it was worth it and it didnt cool it a bit neither the
way Ive seen them kind of interruptions do lots of times  There was a
considerable good deal of talk all the afternoon and me and Tom was on
the lookout all the time but it warnt no use they didnt happen to say
nothing about any runaway nigger and we was afraid to try to work up to
it  But at supper at night one of the little boys says

Pa maynt Tom and Sid and me go to the show

No says the old man I reckon there aint going to be any and you
couldnt go if there was because the runaway nigger told Burton and me
all about that scandalous show and Burton said he would tell the people
so I reckon theyve drove the owdacious loafers out of town before this
time

So there it wasbut I couldnt help it  Tom and me was to sleep in the
same room and bed so being tired we bid goodnight and went up to bed
right after supper and clumb out of the window and down the
lightningrod and shoved for the town for I didnt believe anybody was
going to give the king and the duke a hint and so if I didnt hurry up
and give them one theyd get into trouble sure

On the road Tom he told me all about how it was reckoned I was murdered
and how pap disappeared pretty soon and didnt come back no more and
what a stir there was when Jim run away and I told Tom all about our
Royal Nonesuch rapscallions and as much of the raft voyage as I had time
to and as we struck into the town and up through thehere comes a
raging rush of people with torches and an awful whooping and yelling
and banging tin pans and blowing horns and we jumped to one side to let
them go by and as they went by I see they had the king and the duke
astraddle of a railthat is I knowed it WAS the king and the duke
though they was all over tar and feathers and didnt look like nothing
in the world that was humanjust looked like a couple of monstrous big
soldierplumes  Well it made me sick to see it and I was sorry for
them poor pitiful rascals it seemed like I couldnt ever feel any
hardness against them any more in the world  It was a dreadful thing to
see  Human beings CAN be awful cruel to one another

We see we was too latecouldnt do no good  We asked some stragglers
about it and they said everybody went to the show looking very innocent
and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in the middle of
his cavortings on the stage then somebody give a signal and the house
rose up and went for them

So we poked along back home and I warnt feeling so brash as I was
before but kind of ornery and humble and to blame somehowthough I
hadnt done nothing  But thats always the way it dont make no
difference whether you do right or wrong a persons conscience aint got
no sense and just goes for him anyway  If I had a yaller dog that
didnt know no more than a persons conscience does I would pison him
It takes up more room than all the rest of a persons insides and yet
aint no good nohow  Tom Sawyer he says the same




CHAPTER XXXIV

WE stopped talking and got to thinking  By and by Tom says

Looky here Huck what fools we are to not think of it before  I bet I
know where Jim is

No  Where

In that hut down by the ashhopper  Why looky here  When we was at
dinner didnt you see a nigger man go in there with some vittles

Yes

What did you think the vittles was for

For a dog

So d I Well it wasnt for a dog

Why

Because part of it was watermelon

So it wasI noticed it  Well it does beat all that I never thought
about a dog not eating watermelon  It shows how a body can see and dont
see at the same time

Well the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in and he locked it
again when he came out  He fetched uncle a key about the time we got up
from tablesame key I bet  Watermelon shows man lock shows prisoner
and it aint likely theres two prisoners on such a little plantation
and where the peoples all so kind and good  Jims the prisoner  All
rightIm glad we found it out detective fashion I wouldnt give
shucks for any other way  Now you work your mind and study out a plan
to steal Jim and I will study out one too and well take the one we
like the best

What a head for just a boy to have  If I had Tom Sawyers head I
wouldnt trade it off to be a duke nor mate of a steamboat nor clown in
a circus nor nothing I can think of  I went to thinking out a plan but
only just to be doing something I knowed very well where the right plan
was going to come from  Pretty soon Tom says

Ready

Yes I says

All rightbring it out

My plan is this I says  We can easy find out if its Jim in there
Then get up my canoe tomorrow night and fetch my raft over from the
island  Then the first dark night that comes steal the key out of the
old mans britches after he goes to bed and shove off down the river on
the raft with Jim hiding daytimes and running nights the way me and Jim
used to do before  Wouldnt that plan work

WORK  Why certnly it would work like rats afighting  But its too
blame simple there aint nothing TO it  Whats the good of a plan that
aint no more trouble than that  Its as mild as goosemilk  Why Huck
it wouldnt make no more talk than breaking into a soap factory

I never said nothing because I warnt expecting nothing different but I
knowed mighty well that whenever he got HIS plan ready it wouldnt have
none of them objections to it

And it didnt  He told me what it was and I see in a minute it was
worth fifteen of mine for style and would make Jim just as free a man as
mine would and maybe get us all killed besides  So I was satisfied and
said we would waltz in on it  I neednt tell what it was here because I
knowed it wouldnt stay the way it was  I knowed he would be changing
it around every which way as we went along and heaving in new
bullinesses wherever he got a chance  And that is what he done

Well one thing was dead sure and that was that Tom Sawyer was in
earnest and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of slavery
That was the thing that was too many for me  Here was a boy that was
respectable and well brung up and had a character to lose and folks at
home that had characters and he was bright and not leatherheaded and
knowing and not ignorant and not mean but kind and yet here he was
without any more pride or rightness or feeling than to stoop to this
business and make himself a shame and his family a shame before
everybody  I COULDNT understand it no way at all  It was outrageous
and I knowed I ought to just up and tell him so and so be his true
friend and let him quit the thing right where he was and save himself
And I DID start to tell him but he shut me up and says

Dont you reckon I know what Im about  Dont I generly know what Im
about

Yes

Didnt I SAY I was going to help steal the nigger

Yes

WELL then

Thats all he said and thats all I said  It warnt no use to say any
more because when he said hed do a thing he always done it  But I
couldnt make out how he was willing to go into this thing so I just let
it go and never bothered no more about it  If he was bound to have it
so I couldnt help it

When we got home the house was all dark and still so we went on down to
the hut by the ashhopper for to examine it  We went through the yard so
as to see what the hounds would do  They knowed us and didnt make no
more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything comes by in
the night  When we got to the cabin we took a look at the front and the
two sides and on the side I warnt acquainted withwhich was the north
sidewe found a square windowhole up tolerable high with just one
stout board nailed across it  I says

Heres the ticket  This holes big enough for Jim to get through if we
wrench off the board

Tom says

Its as simple as tittattoe threeinarow and as easy as playing
hooky  I should HOPE we can find a way thats a little more complicated
than THAT Huck Finn

Well then I says how ll it do to saw him out the way I done
before I was murdered that time

Thats more LIKE he says  Its real mysterious and troublesome and
good he says but I bet we can find a way thats twice as long  There
aint no hurry les keep on looking around

Betwixt the hut and the fence on the back side was a leanto that
joined the hut at the eaves and was made out of plank  It was as long
as the hut but narrowonly about six foot wide  The door to it was at
the south end and was padlocked  Tom he went to the soapkettle and
searched around and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid with
so he took it and prized out one of the staples  The chain fell down
and we opened the door and went in and shut it and struck a match and
see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadnt no connection with
it and there warnt no floor to the shed nor nothing in it but some old
rusty playedout hoes and spades and picks and a crippled plow  The
match went out and so did we and shoved in the staple again and the
door was locked as good as ever Tom was joyful  He says

Now were all right  Well DIG him out  It ll take about a week

Then we started for the house and I went in the back dooryou only have
to pull a buckskin latchstring they dont fasten the doorsbut that
warnt romantical enough for Tom Sawyer no way would do him but he must
climb up the lightningrod  But after he got up half way about three
times and missed fire and fell every time and the last time most busted
his brains out he thought hed got to give it up but after he was
rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck and this time
he made the trip

In the morning we was up at break of day and down to the nigger cabins
to pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed Jimif it WAS
Jim that was being fed  The niggers was just getting through breakfast
and starting for the fields and Jims nigger was piling up a tin pan
with bread and meat and things and whilst the others was leaving the
key come from the house

This nigger had a goodnatured chuckleheaded face and his wool was all
tied up in little bunches with thread  That was to keep witches off  He
said the witches was pestering him awful these nights and making him see
all kinds of strange things and hear all kinds of strange words and
noises and he didnt believe he was ever witched so long before in his
life  He got so worked up and got to running on so about his troubles
he forgot all about what hed been agoing to do  So Tom says

Whats the vittles for  Going to feed the dogs

The nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face like when you
heave a brickbat in a mudpuddle and he says

Yes Mars Sid A dog  Curus dog too  Does you want to go en look at
im

Yes

I hunched Tom and whispers

You going right here in the daybreak  THAT warnt the plan

No it warnt but its the plan NOW

So drat him we went along but I didnt like it much  When we got in
we couldnt hardly see anything it was so dark but Jim was there sure
enough and could see us and he sings out

Why HUCK  En good LAN ain dat Misto Tom

I just knowed how it would be I just expected it  I didnt know nothing
to do and if I had I couldnt a done it because that nigger busted in
and says

Why de gracious sakes do he know you genlmen

We could see pretty well now  Tom he looked at the nigger steady and
kind of wondering and says

Does WHO know us

Why disyer runaway nigger

I dont reckon he does but what put that into your head

What PUT it dar  Didn he jis dis minute sing out like he knowed you

Tom says in a puzzledup kind of way

Well thats mighty curious  WHO sung out WHEN did he sing out  WHAT
did he sing out And turns to me perfectly cam and says Did YOU
hear anybody sing out

Of course there warnt nothing to be said but the one thing so I says

No I aint heard nobody say nothing

Then he turns to Jim and looks him over like he never see him before
and says

Did you sing out

No sah says Jim I haint said nothing sah

Not a word

No sah I haint said a word

Did you ever see us before

No sah not as I knows on

So Tom turns to the nigger which was looking wild and distressed and
says kind of severe

What do you reckons the matter with you anyway  What made you think
somebody sung out

Oh its de dadblame witches sah en I wisht I was dead I do  Deys
awluz at it sah en dey do mos kill me dey skyers me so  Please to
dont tell nobody bout it sah er ole Mars Silas hell scole me kase
he say dey AINT no witches  I jis wish to goodness he was heah now
DEN what would he say  I jis bet he couldn fine no way to git aroun
it DIS time  But its awluz jis so people dats SOT stays sot dey
wont look into nothnen fine it out fr deyselves en when YOU fine it
out en tell um bout it dey doan blieve you

Tom give him a dime and said we wouldnt tell nobody and told him to
buy some more thread to tie up his wool with and then looks at Jim and
says

I wonder if Uncle Silas is going to hang this nigger  If I was to catch
a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away I wouldnt give him up
Id hang him  And whilst the nigger stepped to the door to look at the
dime and bite it to see if it was good he whispers to Jim and says

Dont ever let on to know us  And if you hear any digging going on
nights its us were going to set you free

Jim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it then the nigger
come back and we said wed come again some time if the nigger wanted us
to and he said he would more particular if it was dark because the
witches went for him mostly in the dark and it was good to have folks
around then




CHAPTER XXXV

IT would be most an hour yet till breakfast so we left and struck down
into the woods because Tom said we got to have SOME light to see how to
dig by and a lantern makes too much and might get us into trouble what
we must have was a lot of them rotten chunks thats called foxfire and
just makes a soft kind of a glow when you lay them in a dark place  We
fetched an armful and hid it in the weeds and set down to rest and Tom
says kind of dissatisfied

Blame it this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can be
And so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan  There
aint no watchman to be druggednow there OUGHT to be a watchman  There
aint even a dog to give a sleepingmixture to  And theres Jim chained
by one leg with a tenfoot chain to the leg of his bed  why all you
got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip off the chain  And Uncle
Silas he trusts everybody sends the key to the punkinheaded nigger and
dont send nobody to watch the nigger  Jim could a got out of that
windowhole before this only there wouldnt be no use trying to travel
with a tenfoot chain on his leg  Why drat it Huck its the stupidest
arrangement I ever see You got to invent ALL the difficulties  Well we
cant help it we got to do the best we can with the materials weve got
Anyhow theres one thingtheres more honor in getting him out
through a lot of difficulties and dangers where there warnt one of them
furnished to you by the people who it was their duty to furnish them and
you had to contrive them all out of your own head  Now look at just that
one thing of the lantern  When you come down to the cold facts we
simply got to LET ON that a lanterns resky  Why we could work with a
torchlight procession if we wanted to I believe  Now whilst I think of
it we got to hunt up something to make a saw out of the first chance we
get

What do we want of a saw

What do we WANT of a saw  Haint we got to saw the leg of Jims bed
off so as to get the chain loose

Why you just said a body could lift up the bedstead and slip the chain
off

Well if that aint just like you Huck Finn  You CAN get up the
infantschooliest ways of going at a thing  Why haint you ever read
any books at allBaron Trenck nor Casanova nor Benvenuto Chelleeny
nor Henri IV nor none of them heroes  Who ever heard of getting a
prisoner loose in such an oldmaidy way as that  No the way all the
best authorities does is to saw the bedleg in two and leave it just so
and swallow the sawdust so it cant be found and put some dirt and
grease around the sawed place so the very keenest seneskal cant see no
sign of its being sawed and thinks the bedleg is perfectly sound
Then the night youre ready fetch the leg a kick down she goes slip
off your chain and there you are  Nothing to do but hitch your rope
ladder to the battlements shin down it break your leg in the moat
because a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short you knowand theres
your horses and your trusty vassles and they scoop you up and fling you
across a saddle and away you go to your native Langudoc or Navarre or
wherever it is Its gaudy Huck  I wish there was a moat to this cabin
If we get time the night of the escape well dig one

I says

What do we want of a moat when were going to snake him out from under
the cabin

But he never heard me  He had forgot me and everything else  He had his
chin in his hand thinking  Pretty soon he sighs and shakes his head
then sighs again and says

No it wouldnt dothere aint necessity enough for it

For what  I says

Why to saw Jims leg off he says

Good land  I says why there aint NO necessity for it  And what
would you want to saw his leg off for anyway

Well some of the best authorities has done it  They couldnt get the
chain off so they just cut their hand off and shoved  And a leg would
be better still  But we got to let that go  There aint necessity
enough in this case and besides Jims a nigger and wouldnt
understand the reasons for it and how its the custom in Europe so
well let it go  But theres one thinghe can have a rope ladder we
can tear up our sheets and make him a rope ladder easy enough  And we
can send it to him in a pie its mostly done that way  And Ive et
worse pies

Why Tom Sawyer how you talk I says Jim aint got no use for a rope
ladder

He HAS got use for it  How YOU talk you better say you dont know
nothing about it  Hes GOT to have a rope ladder they all do

What in the nation can he DO with it

DO with it  He can hide it in his bed cant he  Thats what they all
do and HES got to too  Huck you dont ever seem to want to do
anything thats regular you want to be starting something fresh all the
time Spose he DONT do nothing with it aint it there in his bed for
a clew after hes gone and dont you reckon theyll want clews  Of
course they will  And you wouldnt leave them any  That would be a
PRETTY howdydo WOULDNT it  I never heard of such a thing

Well I says if its in the regulations and hes got to have it all
right let him have it because I dont wish to go back on no
regulations but theres one thing Tom Sawyerif we go to tearing up
our sheets to make Jim a rope ladder were going to get into trouble
with Aunt Sally just as sure as youre born  Now the way I look at it
a hickrybark ladder dont cost nothing and dont waste nothing and is
just as good to load up a pie with and hide in a straw tick as any rag
ladder you can start and as for Jim he aint had no experience and so
he dont care what kind of a

Oh shucks Huck Finn if I was as ignorant as you Id keep still
thats what ID do  Who ever heard of a state prisoner escaping by a
hickrybark ladder  Why its perfectly ridiculous

Well all right Tom fix it your own way but if youll take my advice
youll let me borrow a sheet off of the clothesline

He said that would do  And that gave him another idea and he says

Borrow a shirt too

What do we want of a shirt Tom

Want it for Jim to keep a journal on

Journal your grannyJIM cant write

Spose he CANT writehe can make marks on the shirt cant he if we
make him a pen out of an old pewter spoon or a piece of an old iron
barrelhoop

Why Tom we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a better
one and quicker too

PRISONERS dont have geese running around the donjonkeep to pull pens
out of you muggins  They ALWAYS make their pens out of the hardest
toughest troublesomest piece of old brass candlestick or something like
that they can get their hands on and it takes them weeks and weeks and
months and months to file it out too because theyve got to do it by
rubbing it on the wall  THEY wouldnt use a goosequill if they had it
It aint regular

Well then whatll we make him the ink out of

Many makes it out of ironrust and tears but thats the common sort and
women the best authorities uses their own blood  Jim can do that and
when he wants to send any little common ordinary mysterious message to
let the world know where hes captivated he can write it on the bottom
of a tin plate with a fork and throw it out of the window  The Iron Mask
always done that and its a blame good way too

Jim aint got no tin plates  They feed him in a pan

That aint nothing we can get him some

Cant nobody READ his plates

That aint got anything to DO with it Huck Finn  All HES got to do is
to write on the plate and throw it out  You dont HAVE to be able to
read it Why half the time you cant read anything a prisoner writes on
a tin plate or anywhere else

Well then whats the sense in wasting the plates

Why blame it all it aint the PRISONERS plates

But its SOMEBODYS plates aint it

Well sposn it is  What does the PRISONER care whose

He broke off there because we heard the breakfasthorn blowing  So we
cleared out for the house

Along during the morning I borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of the
clothesline and I found an old sack and put them in it and we went
down and got the foxfire and put that in too  I called it borrowing
because that was what pap always called it but Tom said it warnt
borrowing it was stealing  He said we was representing prisoners and
prisoners dont care how they get a thing so they get it and nobody
dont blame them for it either  It aint no crime in a prisoner to
steal the thing he needs to get away with Tom said its his right and
so as long as we was representing a prisoner we had a perfect right to
steal anything on this place we had the least use for to get ourselves
out of prison with  He said if we warnt prisoners it would be a very
different thing and nobody but a mean ornery person would steal when he
warnt a prisoner  So we allowed we would steal everything there was
that come handy  And yet he made a mighty fuss one day after that
when I stole a watermelon out of the niggerpatch and eat it and he made
me go and give the niggers a dime without telling them what it was for
Tom said that what he meant was we could steal anything we NEEDED Well
I says I needed the watermelon  But he said I didnt need it to get out
of prison with theres where the difference was  He said if Id a
wanted it to hide a knife in and smuggle it to Jim to kill the seneskal
with it would a been all right  So I let it go at that though I
couldnt see no advantage in my representing a prisoner if I got to set
down and chaw over a lot of goldleaf distinctions like that every time I
see a chance to hog a watermelon

Well as I was saying we waited that morning till everybody was settled
down to business and nobody in sight around the yard then Tom he
carried the sack into the leanto whilst I stood off a piece to keep
watch  By and by he come out and we went and set down on the woodpile
to talk  He says

Everythings all right now except tools and thats easy fixed

Tools  I says

Yes

Tools for what

Why to dig with  We aint agoing to GNAW him out are we

Aint them old crippled picks and things in there good enough to dig a
nigger out with  I says

He turns on me looking pitying enough to make a body cry and says

Huck Finn did you EVER hear of a prisoner having picks and shovels and
all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig himself out with  Now
I want to ask youif you got any reasonableness in you at allwhat kind
of a show would THAT give him to be a hero  Why they might as well lend
him the key and done with it  Picks and shovelswhy they wouldnt
furnish em to a king

Well then I says if we dont want the picks and shovels what do we
want

A couple of caseknives

To dig the foundations out from under that cabin with

Yes

Confound it its foolish Tom

It dont make no difference how foolish it is its the RIGHT wayand
its the regular way  And there aint no OTHER way that ever I heard
of and Ive read all the books that gives any information about these
things They always dig out with a caseknifeand not through dirt mind
you generly its through solid rock  And it takes them weeks and weeks
and weeks and for ever and ever  Why look at one of them prisoners in
the bottom dungeon of the Castle Deef in the harbor of Marseilles that
dug himself out that way how long was HE at it you reckon

I dont know

Well guess

I dont know  A month and a half

THIRTYSEVEN YEARand he come out in China  THATS the kind  I wish
the bottom of THIS fortress was solid rock

JIM dont know nobody in China

Whats THAT got to do with it  Neither did that other fellow  But
youre always awandering off on a side issue  Why cant you stick to
the main point

All rightI dont care where he comes out so he COMES out and Jim
dont either I reckon  But theres one thing anywayJims too old to
be dug out with a caseknife  He wont last

Yes he will LAST too  You dont reckon its going to take thirtyseven
years to dig out through a DIRT foundation do you

How long will it take Tom

Well we cant resk being as long as we ought to because it maynt take
very long for Uncle Silas to hear from down there by New Orleans  Hell
hear Jim aint from there  Then his next move will be to advertise Jim
or something like that  So we cant resk being as long digging him out
as we ought to  By rights I reckon we ought to be a couple of years but
we cant  Things being so uncertain what I recommend is this  that we
really dig right in as quick as we can and after that we can LET ON
to ourselves that we was at it thirtyseven years  Then we can snatch
him out and rush him away the first time theres an alarm  Yes I reckon
that ll be the best way

Now theres SENSE in that I says  Letting on dont cost nothing
letting on aint no trouble and if its any object I dont mind letting
on we was at it a hundred and fifty year  It wouldnt strain me none
after I got my hand in  So Ill mosey along now and smouch a couple of
caseknives

Smouch three he says we want one to make a saw out of

Tom if it aint unregular and irreligious to sejest it I says
theres an old rusty sawblade around yonder sticking under the
weatherboarding behind the smokehouse

He looked kind of weary and discouragedlike and says

It aint no use to try to learn you nothing Huck  Run along and smouch
the knivesthree of them  So I done it
