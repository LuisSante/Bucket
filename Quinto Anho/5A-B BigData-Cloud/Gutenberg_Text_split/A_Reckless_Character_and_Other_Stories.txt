A RECKLESS CHARACTER






I


There were eight of us in the room and we were discussing contemporary
matters and persons

I do not understand these gentlemen remarked AThey are fellows of
a reckless sort Really desperate There has never been anything
of the kind before

Yes there has put in P a greyhaired old man who had been born
about the twenties of the present centurythere were reckless men in
days gone by also Some one said of the poet Yzykoff that he had
enthusiasm which was not directed to anything an objectless enthusiasm
and it was much the same with those peopletheir recklessness was
without an object But see here if you will permit me I will narrate
to you the story of my grandnephew Msha Plteff It may serve as a
sample of the recklessness of those days

He made his appearance in Gods daylight in the year  I remember
on his fathers ancestral estate in one of the most remote nooks of a
remote government of the steppes I still preserve a distinct
recollection of Mshas father Andri Nikolevitch Plteff He was a
genuine oldfashioned landed proprietor a pious inhabitant of the
steppes sufficiently well educatedaccording to the standards of that
epochrather crackbrained if the truth must be told and subject in
addition to epileptic fits That also is an oldfashioned malady
However Andri Nikolevitchs attacks were quiet and they generally
terminated in a sleep and in a fit of melancholyHe was kind of heart
courteous in manner not devoid of some pomposity I have always
pictured to myself the Tzar Mikhal Fedorovitch as just that sort of a
man

Andri Nikolevitchs whole life flowed past in the punctual discharge
of all the rites established since time immemorial in strict conformity
with all the customs of ancientorthodox HolyRussian life He rose and
went to bed he ate and went to the bath he waxed merry or wrathful he
did both the one and the other rarely it is true he even smoked his
pipe he even played cards two great innovations not as suited his
fancy not after his own fashion but in accordance with the rule and
tradition handed down from his ancestors in proper and dignified style
He himself was tall of stature of noble mien and brawny he had a
quiet and rather hoarse voice as is frequently the case with virtuous
Russians he was neat about his linen and his clothing wore white
neckerchiefs and longskirted coats of snuffbrown hue but his noble
blood made itself manifest notwithstanding no one would have taken him
for a priests son or a merchant Andri Nikolevitch always knew in
all possible circumstances and encounters precisely how he ought to act
and exactly what expressions he must employ he knew when he ought to
take medicine and what medicine to take which symptoms he should heed
and which might be disregarded  in a word he knew everything that it
was proper to do It was as though he said Everything has been
foreseen and decreed by the old menthe only thing is not to devise
anything of your own And the chief thing of all is dont go even as
far as the threshold without Gods blessingI am bound to admit that
deadly tedium reigned in his house in those lowceiled warm dark
rooms which so often resounded from the chanting of vigils and
prayerservices with an odour of incense and fastingviands
which almost never left them

Andri Nikolevitch had married when he was no longer in his first
youth a poor young noblewoman of the neighbourhood a very nervous and
sickly person who had been reared in one of the government institutes
for gentlewomen She played far from badly on the piano she spoke
French in boardingschool fashion she was given to enthusiasm and
still more addicted to melancholy and even to tears In a word she
was of an uneasy character As she considered that her life had been
ruined she could not love her husband who as a matter of course
did not understand her but she respected she tolerated him and as she
was a thoroughly honest and perfectly cold being she never once so much
as thought of any other object Moreover she was constantly engrossed
by anxieties in the first place over her really feeble health in the
second place over the health of her husband whose fits always inspired
her with something akin to superstitious terror and in conclusion
over her only son Msha whom she reared herself with great zeal
Andri Nikolevitch did not prevent his wifes busying herself with
Mshabut on one condition she was never under any circumstances to
depart from the limits which had been defined once for all wherein
everything in his house must revolve Thus for example during the
Christmas holidays and Vaslys evening preceding the New Year Msha
was not only permitted to dress up in costume along with the other
ladsdoing so was even imposed upon him as an obligation
On the other hand God forbid that he should do it at any other time
And so forth and so forth




II


I remember this Msha at the age of thirteen He was a very comely lad
with rosy little cheeks and soft little lips and altogether he was soft
and plump with somewhat prominent humid eyes carefully brushed and
coifeda regular little girlThere was only one thing about him which
displeased me he laughed rarely but when he did laugh his teeth which
were large white and pointed like those of a wild animal displayed
themselves unpleasantly his very laugh had a sharp and even
fiercealmost brutalring to it and evil flashes darted athwart his
eyes His mother always boasted of his being so obedient and polite and
that he was not fond of consorting with naughty boys but always was
more inclined to feminine society

He is his mothers son an effeminate fellow his father Andri
Nikolevitch was wont to say of himbut on the other hand he
likes to go to Gods church And that delights me

Only one old neighbour a former commissary of the rural police once
said in my presence concerning MshaGood gracious he will turn out
a rebel And I remember that that word greatly surprised me at the
time The former commissary of police it is true had a habit of
descrying rebels everywhere

Just this sort of exemplary youth did Msha remain until the age of
eighteenuntil the death of his parents whom he lost on almost one
and the same day As I resided constantly in Moscow I heard nothing
about my young relative Some one who came to town from his government
did it is true inform me that Msha had sold his ancestral estate for
a song but this bit of news seemed to me altogether too
incredibleAnd lo suddenly one autumn morning into the courtyard of
my house dashes a calash drawn by a pair of splendid trotters with a
monstrous coachman on the box and in the calash wrapped in a cloak of
military cut with a twoarshn beaver collar and a fatiguecap over
one ear la diable memportesits Msha

On catching sight of me I was standing at the drawingroom window and
staring in amazement at the equipage which had dashed in he burst into
his sharp laugh and jauntily shaking the lapels of his cloak he
sprang out of the calash and ran into the house

Msha Mikhal Andrevitch I was beginning  is it you

Call me thou and Msha he interrupted meTis I  tis I in
person I have come to Moscow  to take a look at people  and to
show myself So I have dropped in on youWhat do you think of my
trotters Hey Again he laughed loudly

Although seven years had elapsed since I had seen Msha for the last
time yet I recognised him on the instantHis face remained thoroughly
youthful and as comely as of yore his moustache had not even sprouted
but under his eyes on his cheeks a puffiness had made its appearance
and an odour of liquor proceeded from his mouth

And hast thou been long in Moscow I inquiredI supposed that thou
wert off there in the country managing thy estate

Eh I immediately got rid of the villageAs soon as my parents
diedmay the kingdom of heaven be theirsMsha crossed himself
with sincerity without the slightest hypocrisyI instantly without
the slightest delay  ein zwei drei Haha I let it go cheap the
rascally thing Such a scoundrel turned upWell never mind At all
events I shall live at my easeand amuse othersBut why do you stare
at me soDo you really think that I ought to have spun the affair out
indefinitely My dear relative cant I have a drink

Msha talked with frightful rapidity hurriedly and at the same time as
though half asleep

Good mercy MshaI shouted Have the fear of God before thine
eyes How dreadful is thine aspect in what a condition thou art And
thou wishest another drink And to sell such a fine estate for a
song

I always fear God and remember him he caught me upAnd he s
goodGod I mean Hell forgive And I also am good I have never
injured any one in my life as yet And a drink is good also and as for
hurting  it wont hurt anybody either And as for my looks they are
all right If thou wishest uncle Ill walk a line on the floor Or
shall I dance a bit

Akh please drop thatWhat occasion is there for dancing Thou hadst
better sit down

I dont mind sitting down But why dont you say something about my
greys Just look at them theyre regular lions Im hiring them for the
time being but I shall certainly buy them together with the coachman
It is incomparably cheaper to own ones horses And I did have the
money but I dropped it last night at faroNever mind Ill retrieve
my fortunes tomorrow Uncle  how about that drink

I still could not collect myselfGood gracious Msha how old art
thou Thou shouldst not be occupying thyself with horses or with
gambling  thou shouldst enter the university or the service

Msha first roared with laughter again then he emitted a prolonged
whistle

Well uncle I see that thou art in a melancholy frame of mind just
now Ill call another timeBut see here just look in at Soklniki
some evening I have pitched my tent there The Gipsies sing Well
well One can hardly restrain himself And on the tent there is a
pennant and on the pennant is written in biiig letters The Band of
Poltva Gipsies The pennant undulates like a serpent the letters
are gilded any one can easily read them The entertainment is whatever
any one likes They refuse nothing It has kicked up a dust all over
Moscow  my respects Well Will you come Ive got a Gipsy
therea regular asp Black as my boot fierce as a dog and eyes 
regular coals of fire One cant possibly make out whether she is
kissing or biting Will you come uncle Well farewell for the
present

And abruptly embracing me and kissing me with a smack on my shoulder
Msha darted out into the court to his calash waving his cap over his
head and uttering a yell the monstrous coachman bestowed upon him
an oblique glance across his beard the trotters dashed forward and all
disappeared

On the following day sinful man that I am I did go to Soklniki and
actually did see the tent with the pennant and the inscription The
tentflaps were raised an uproar crashing squealing proceeded
thence A crowd of people thronged around it On the ground on an
outspread rug sat the Gipsy men and Gipsy women singing and thumping
tambourines and in the middle of them with a guitar in his hands clad
in a redsilk shirt and full trousers of velvet Msha was gyrating like
a whirligigGentlemen Respected sirs Pray enter The performance is
about to begin Freehe was shouting in a cracked voiceHey there
Champagne Bang In the forehead On the ceiling Akh thou rascal Paul
de KockLuckily he did not catch sight of me and I hastily beat a
retreat

I shall not dilate gentlemen on my amazement at the sight of such a
change And as a matter of fact how could that peaceable modest lad
suddenly turn into a tipsy goodfornothing Was it possible that all
this had been concealed within him since his childhood and had
immediately come to the surface as soon as the weight of parental
authority had been removed from himAnd that he had kicked up a dust
in Moscow as he had expressed it there could be no possible doubt
either I had seen rakes in my day but here something frantic some
frenzy of selfextermination some sort of recklessness had made itself
manifest




III


This diversion lasted for two months And lo again I am standing at
the window of the drawingroom and looking out into the courtyard
Suddenlywhat is this Through the gate with quiet step enters a
novice His conical cap is pulled down on his brow his hair is
combed smoothly and flows from under it to right and left  he wears a
long cassock and a leather girdle Can it be Msha It is

I go out on the steps to meet him What is the meaning of this
masquerade I ask

It is not a masquerade uncle Msha answers me with a deep
sighbut as I have squandered all my property to the last kopk and
as a mighty repentance has seized upon me I have made up my mind to
betake myself to the TritzkoSrgieva Lvra to pray away my sins
For what asylum is now left to me And so I have come to bid you
farewell uncle like the Prodigal Son

I gazed intently at Msha His face was the same as ever fresh and rosy
by the way it never changed to the very end and his eyes were humid
and caressing and languishing and his hands were small and white
But he reeked of liquor

Very well I said at last It is a good move if there is no other
issue But why dost thou smell of liquor

Old habit replied Msha and suddenly burst out laughing but
immediately caught himself up and making a straight low monastic
obeisance he addedWill not you contribute something for the
journey For I am going to the monastery on foot

When

Today  at once

Why art thou in such a hurry

Uncle my motto has always been Hurry Hurry

But what is thy motto now

It is the same now Only Hurryto good

So Msha went away leaving me to meditate over the mutability of human
destinies

But he speedily reminded me of his existence A couple of months after
his visit I received a letter from himthe first of those letters with
which he afterward favoured me And note this peculiarity I have rarely
beheld a neater more legible handwriting than was possessed by this
unmethodical man The style of his letters also was very regular and
slightly florid The invariable appeals for assistance alternated with
promises of amendment with honourable words and with oaths All this
appeared to beand perhaps wassincere Mshas signature at the end
of his letters was always accompanied by peculiar flourishes lines and
dots and he used a great many exclamationpoints In that first letter
Msha informed me of a new turn in his fortune Later on he called
these turns dives  and he dived frequently He had gone off to the
Caucasus to serve the Tzar and fatherland with his breast in the
capacity of a yunker And although a certain benevolent aunt had
commiserated his povertystricken condition and had sent him an
insignificant sum nevertheless he asked me to help him to equip
himself I complied with his request and for a period of two years
thereafter I heard nothing about him I must confess that I entertained
strong doubts as to his having gone to the Caucasus But it turned out
that he really had gone thither had entered the T regiment as
yunker through influence and had served in it those two years Whole
legends were fabricated there about him One of the officers in his
regiment communicated them to me




IV


I learned a great deal which I had not expected from him I was not
surprised of course that he had proved to be a poor even a downright
worthless military man and soldier but what I had not expected was
that he had displayed no special bravery that in battle he wore a
dejected and languid aspect as though he were partly bored partly
daunted All discipline oppressed him inspired him with sadness he was
audacious to recklessness when it was a question of himself personally
there was no wager too crazy for him to accept but do evil to others
kill fight he could not perhaps because he had a good heartand
perhaps because his cottonwool education as he expressed it had
enervated him He was ready to exterminate himself in any sort of way at
any time But othersno The devil only can make him out his
comrades said of himhes puny a ragand what a reckless fellow he
isa regular daredevilI happened afterward to ask Msha what evil
spirit prompted him made him indulge in drinkingbouts risk his life
and so forth He always had one answer Spleen

But why hast thou spleen

Just because I have good gracious One comes to himself recovers his
senses and begins to meditate about poverty about injustice about
Russia Well and that settles it Immediately one feels such spleen
that he is ready to send a bullet into his forehead One goes on a
carouse instinctively

But why hast thou mixed up Russia with this

What else could I do NothingThats why I am afraid to think

All thatthat spleencomes of thy idleness

But I dont know how to do anything uncle My dear relative Here now
if it were a question of taking and staking my life on a cardlosing
my all and shooting myself bang in the neckI can do thatHere
now tell me what to do what to risk my life forIll do it this very
minute

But do thou simply live Why risk thy life

I cantYou will tell me that I behave recklessly What else can I
do One begins to thinkand O Lord what comes into his head T is
only the Germans who think

What was the use of arguing with him He was a reckless manand that is
all there is to say

I will repeat to you two or three of the Caucasian legends to which I
have alluded One day in the company of the officers Msha began to
brag of a Circassian sabre which he had obtained in barterA genuine
Persian bladeThe officers expressed doubt as to whether it were
really genuine Msha began to disputeSee here he exclaimed at
lastthey say that the finest judge of Circassian sabres is oneeyed
Abdulka I will go to him and askThe officers were dumbfounded

What Abdulka The one who lives in the mountains The one who is not at
peace with us AbdulKhan

The very man

But he will take thee for a scout he will place thee in the
bughouseor he will cut off thy head with that same sabre And how
wilt thou make thy way to him They will seize thee immediately

But I will go to him nevertheless

We bet that thou wilt not go

I take your bet

And Msha instantly saddled his horse and rode off to Abdulka He was
gone for three days All were convinced that he had come to some
dreadful end And behold he came back somewhat tipsy and with a
sabre only not the one which he had carried away with him but
another They began to question him

Its all right said he Abdulka is a kind man At first he really
did order fetters to be riveted on my legs and was even preparing to
impale me on a stake But I explained to him why I had come Do not
expect any ransom from me said I I havent a farthing to my
nameand I have no relativesAbdulka was amazed he stared at me
with his solitary eyeWell says he thou art the chief of heroes
Russian Am I to believe theeBelieve me said I I never lie
and Msha really never did lieAbdulka looked at me againAnd dost
thou know how to drink wineI do said I as much as thou wilt
give so much will I drinkAgain Abdulka was astonished and
mentioned Allah And then he ordered his daughter or some pretty
maiden whoever she wasanyhow she had the gaze of a jackalto
fetch a leathern bottle of wineAnd I set to workBut thy sabre is
spurious says he here take this genuine one And now thou and I are
friendsAnd you have lost your wager gentlemen so pay up

A second legend concerning Msha runs as follows He was passionately
fond of cards but as he had no money and did not pay his gambling debts
although he was never a sharper no one would any longer sit down to
play with him So one day he began to importune a brother officer and
insisted upon the latters playing with him

But thou wilt be sure to lose and thou wilt not pay

I will not pay in money thats truebut I will shoot a hole through
my left hand with this pistol here

But what profit is there for me in that

No profit whateverbut its a curious thing nevertheless

This conversation took place after a carouse in the presence of
witnesses Whether Mshas proposal really did strike the officer as
curious or notat all events he consented The cards were brought
the game began Msha was lucky he won one hundred rubles And
thereupon his opponent smote himself on the forehead

What a blockhead I am he criedOn what a bait was I caught If
thou hadst lost much thou wouldst have shot thyself through the
handso its just an assault on my pocket

Thats where thou art mistaken retorted MshaI have wonbut Ill
shoot the hole through my hand

He seized his pistol and bang shot himself through the hand The
bullet went clear through  and a week later the wound was completely
healed

On another occasion still Msha is riding along the road by night with
his comrades And they see yawning right by the side of the road a
narrow ravine in the nature of a cleft dark very dark and the bottom
of it not visible

Here now says one comrade Msha is reckless enough about some
things but he will not leap into this ravine

Yes I will

No thou wilt not because it is probably ten fathoms deep and thou
mightest break thy neck

His friend knew how to attack himthrough his vanity Msha had a
great deal of it

But I will leap nevertheless Wilt thou bet on it Ten rubles

All right

And before his comrade had managed to finish the last word Msha flew
off his horse into the ravine and crashed down on the stones They were
all fairly petrified with horror A good minute passed and they
heard Mshas voice proceeding as though from the bowels of the earth
and very dull

Im whole I landed on sand But the descent was long Ten rubles on
you

Climb out shouted his comrades

Yes climb outreturned Msha Damn it One cant climb out of
here You will have to ride off now for ropes and lanterns And in the
meanwhile so that I may not find the waiting tedious toss me down a
flask

And so Msha had to sit for five hours at the bottom of the ravine and
when they dragged him out it appeared that he had a dislocated
shoulder But this did not daunt him in the least On the following day
a blacksmith bonesetter set his shoulder and he used it as though
nothing were the matter

Altogether his health was remarkable unprecedented I have already
told you that until his death he preserved an almost childish freshness
of complexion He did not know what it was to be ill in spite of all
his excesses the vigour of his constitution was not affected in a
single instance Where any other man would have fallen dangerously ill
or even have died he merely shook himself like a duck in the water and
became more blooming than ever Oncethat also was in the Caucasus
This legend is improbable it is true but from it one can judge what
Msha was regarded as capable of doing So then once in the
Caucasus when in a state of intoxication he fell into a small stream
that covered the lower part of his body his head and arms remained
exposed on the bank The affair took place in winter a rigorous frost
set in and when he was found on the following morning his legs and
body were visible beneath a stout crust of ice which had frozen over in
the course of the nightand he never even had a cold in the head in
consequence On another occasion this happened in Russia near
Orl and also during a severe frost he chanced to go to a
suburban eatinghouse in company with seven young theological students
These theological students were celebrating their graduation
examination and had invited Msha as a charming fellow a man with a
sigh as it was called then They drank a great deal and when at
last the merry crew were preparing to depart Msha dead drunk was
found to be already in a state of unconsciousness The whole seven
theological students had between them only one trika sledge with a high
backwhere were they to put the helpless body Then one of the
young men inspired by classical reminiscences suggested that Msha be
tied by the feet to the back of the sledge as Hector was to the chariot
of Achilles The suggestion was approved  and bouncing over the
hummocks sliding sideways down the declivities with his feet strung up
in the air and his head dragging through the snow our Msha traversed
on his back the distance of two versts which separated the restaurant
from the town and never even so much as coughed or frowned With such
marvellous health had nature endowed him




V


Leaving the Caucasus he presented himself once more in Moscow in a
Circassian coat with cartridgepouches on the breast a dagger in his
belt and a tall fur cap on his head From this costume he did not part
until the end although he was no longer in the military service from
which he had been dismissed for not reporting on time He called on me
borrowed a little money  and then began his divings his progress
through the tribulations or as he expressed it through the seven
Semyns then began his sudden absences and returns the
despatching of beautifullywritten letters addressed to all possible
persons beginning with the Metropolitan and ending with ridingmasters
and midwives Then began the visits to acquaintances and strangers And
here is one point which must be noted in making his calls he did not
cringe and did not importune but on the contrary he behaved himself
in decorous fashion and even wore a cheery and pleasant aspect
although an ingrained odour of liquor accompanied him everywhereand
his Oriental costume was gradually reduced to rags

GiveGod will reward youalthough I do not deserve it he was
accustomed to say smiling brightly and blushing openly If you do not
give you will be entirely in the right and I shall not be angry in the
least I shall support myself God will provide For there are many
very many people who are poorer and more worthy than I

Msha enjoyed particular success with women he understood how to arouse
their compassion And do not think that he was or imagined himself to be
a Lovelace Oh no In that respect he was very modest Whether he
had inherited from his parents such cold blood or whether herein was
expressed his disinclination to do evil to any onesince according to
his ideas to consort with a woman means inevitably to insult the
womanI will not take it upon myself to decide only in his relations
with the fair sex he was extremely delicate The women felt this and
all the more willingly did they pity and aid him until he at last
repelled them by his sprees and hard drinking by the recklessness of
which I have already spoken I cannot hit upon any other word

On the other hand in other respects he had already lost all delicacy
and had gradually descended to the extreme depths of degradation He
once went so far that in the Assembly of Nobility of T he placed on
the table a jug with the inscription

Any one who finds it agreeable to tweak the nose of hereditary
nobleman Plteff whose authentic documents are herewith appended
may satisfy his desire on condition that he puts a ruble in this jug

And it is said that there were persons who did care to tweak the
noblemans nose It is true that he first all but throttled one amateur
who having put but one ruble in the jug tweaked his nose twice and
then made him sue for pardon it is true also that he immediately
distributed to other tatterdemalions a portion of the money thus
secured  but nevertheless what outrageous conduct

In the course of his wanderings through the seven Semyns he had also
reached his ancestral nest which he had sold for a song to a speculator
and usurer well known at that period The speculator was at home and on
learning of the arrival of the former owner who had been transformed
into a tramp he gave orders that he was not to be admitted into the
house and that in case of need he was to be flung out by the scruff of
the neck Msha declared that he would not enter the house defiled as
it was by the presence of a scoundrel that he would allow no one to
throw him out but that he was on his way to the churchyard to salute
the dust of his ancestors This he did At the churchyard he was joined
by an old houseserf who had formerly been his mannurse The
speculator had deprived the old man of his monthly stipend and expelled
him from the home farm from that time forth the man sought shelter in
the kennel of a peasant Msha had managed his estate for so short a
time that he had not succeeded in leaving behind him a specially good
memory of himself but the old servitor had not been able to resist
nevertheless and on hearing of his young masters arrival he had
immediately hastened to the churchyard had found Msha seated on the
ground among the mortuary stones had begged leave to kiss his hand in
memory of old times and had even melted into tears as he gazed at the
rags wherewith the once petted limbs of his nursling were swathed Msha
looked long and in silence at the old man

Timofi he said at last

Timofi gave a start

What do you wish

Hast thou a spade

I can get one But what do you want with a spade Mikhalo
Andritch

I want to dig a grave for myself here Timofi and lie down here
forever between my parents For this is the only spot which is left to
me in the world Fetch the spade

I obey said Timofi and went off and brought it

And Msha immediately began to dig up the earth while Timofi stood by
with his chin propped on his hand repeating Thats the only thing
left for thee and me master

And Msha dug and dug inquiring from time to time Life isnt worth
living is it Timofi

It is not dear little father

The hole had already grown fairly deep People saw Mshas work and ran
to report about it to the speculatorowner At first the speculator flew
into a rage and wanted to send for the police What hypocrisy he
said But afterward reflecting probably that it would be inconvenient
to have a row with that lunatic and that a scandal might be the result
he betook himself in person to the churchyard and approaching the
toiling Msha he made a polite obeisance to him The latter continued
to dig as though he had not noticed his successor

Mikhal Andritch began the speculator permit me to inquire what
you are doing there

As you seeI am digging a grave for myself

Why are you doing that

Because I do not wish to live any longer

The speculator fairly flung apart his hands in surpriseYou do not
wish to live

Msha cast a menacing glance at the speculatorDoes that surprise
you Are not you the cause of it all Is it not you Is it not
thou Is it not thou Judas who hast robbed me by taking
advantage of my youth Dost not thou skin the peasants Is it not thou
who hast deprived this decrepit old man of his daily bread Is it not
thou O Lord Everywhere there is injustice and oppression and
villainy So down with everythingand with me also I dont wish to
liveI dont wish to live any longer in RussiaAnd the spade made
swifter progress than ever in Mshas hands

The devil knows the meaning of this thought the speculator he
actually is burying himselfMikhal Andritchhe began afresh
listen I really am guilty toward you people did not represent you
properly to me

Msha went on digging

But why this recklessness

Msha went on diggingand flung the dirt on the speculator as much as
to say Take that earthdevourer

Really you have no cause for this Will not you come to my house to
eat and rest

Msha raised his head a little Now youre talking And will there be
anything to drink

The speculator was delightedGood gracious I should think so

And dost thou invite Timofi also

But why  well I invite him also

Msha reflectedOnly look out  for thou didst turn me out of
doors Dont think thou art going to get off with one bottle

Do not worry  there will be as much as you wish of everything

Msha flung aside his spade Well Timsha he said addressing his
old mannurse let us honour the host Come along

I obey replied the old man

And all three wended their way toward the house

The speculator knew with whom he had to deal Msha made him promise as
a preliminary it is true that he would allow all privileges to the
peasantsbut an hour later that same Msha together with Timofi
both drunk danced a gallopade through those rooms where the pious shade
of Andri Nikolitch seemed still to be hovering and an hour later
still Msha so sound asleep that he could not be waked liquor was his
great weakness was placed in a peasantcart together with his kazk
cap and his dagger and sent off to the town fiveandtwenty versts
distantand there was found under a fence Well and Timofi who
still kept his feet and merely hiccoughed was pitched out neck and
crop as a matter of course The master had made a failure of his
attempt So they might as well let the servant pay the penalty




VI


Again considerable time elapsed and I heard nothing of Msha God
knows where he had vanishedOne day as I was sitting before the
samovr at a postingstation on the T highway waiting for horses
I suddenly heard under the open window of the stationroom a hoarse
voice uttering in FrenchMonsieur  monsieur  prenez piti dun
pauvre gentilhomme ruin I raised my head and looked The kazk
cap with the fur peeled off the broken cartridgepouches on the
tattered Circassian coat the dagger in a cracked sheath the bloated
but still rosy face the dishevelled but still thick hair My God
It was Msha He had already come to begging alms on the highwaysI
involuntarily uttered an exclamation He recognised me shuddered
turned away and was about to withdraw from the window I stopped
him  but what was there that I could say to him Certainly I could
not read him a lecture In silence I offered him a fiveruble
banknote With equal silence he grasped it in his still white and
plump though trembling and dirty hand and disappeared round the
corner of the house

They did not furnish me with horses very promptly and I had time to
indulge in cheerless meditations on the subject of my unexpected
encounter with Msha I felt consciencestricken that I had let him go
in so unsympathetic a mannerAt last I proceeded on my journey and
after driving half a verst from the postingstation I observed ahead of
me on the road a crowd of people moving along with a strange and as it
were measured tread I overtook this crowdand what did I seeTwelve
beggars with wallets on their shoulders were walking by twos singing
and skipping as they wentand at their head danced Msha stamping
time with his feet and saying Natchikitchikaldi tchuktchuktchuk
Natchikitchikaldi tchuktchuktchuk

As soon as my calash came on a level with him and he caught sight of
me he immediately began to shout Hurrah Halt draw up in line Eyes
front my guard of the road

The beggars took up his cry and haltedwhile he with his habitual
laugh sprang upon the carriagestep and again yelled Hurrah

What is the meaning of this I asked with involuntary amazement

This This is my squad my army all beggars Gods people my friends
Each one of them thanks to your kindness has quaffed a cup of liquor
and now we are all rejoicing and making merry Uncle Tis only with
the beggars and Gods poor that one can live in the world you know 
by God thats so

I made him no reply  but this time he seemed to me such a
goodnatured soul his face expressed such childlike ingenuousness  a
light suddenly seemed to dawn upon me and there came a prick at my
heart

Get into the calash with me I said to him

He was amazed

What Get into the calash

Get in get in I repeated I want to make thee a proposition Get
in Drive on with me

Well you commandHe got inCome and as for you my dear
friends respected comrades he added to the beggars goodbye Until
we meet againMsha took off his kazk cap and made a low bowThe
beggars all seemed to be dumbfounded I ordered the coachman to whip
up the horses and the calash rolled on

This is what I wished to propose to Msha the idea had suddenly
occurred to me to take him into my establishment into my countryhouse
which was situated about thirty versts from that postingstationto
save him or at least to make an effort to save him

Hearken Msha said I wilt thou settle down with me Thou shalt
have everything provided for thee clothes and underlinen shall be made
for thee thou shalt be properly fitted out and thou shalt receive
money for tobacco and so forth only on one condition not to drink
liquor Dost thou accept

Msha was even frightened with joy He opened his eyes very wide turned
crimson and suddenly falling on my shoulder he began to kiss me and to
repeat in a spasmodic voiceUncle  benefactor May God reward
you He melted into tears at last and doffing his kazk cap began
to wipe his eyes his nose and his lips with it

Look out I said to him Remember the conditionnot to drink
liquor

Why damn it he exclaimed flourishing both hands and as a result
of that energetic movement I was still more strongly flooded with that
spirituous odour wherewith he was thoroughly impregnated You see
dear uncle if you only knew my life If it were not for grief cruel
Fate you know But now I swearI swear that I will reform and
will prove Uncle I have never liedask any one you like if I
have I am an honourable but an unhappy man uncle I have never
known kindness from any one

At this point he finally dissolved in sobs I tried to soothe him and
succeeded for when we drove up to my house Msha had long been sleeping
the sleep of the dead with his head resting on my knees




VII


He was immediately allotted a special room and also immediately as the
first measure taken to the bath which was absolutely indispensable
All his garments and his dagger and tall kazk cap and holeridden
shoes were carefully laid away in the storehouse clean linen was put
on him slippers and some of my clothing which as is always the case
with paupers exactly fitted his build and stature When he came to the
table washed neat fresh he seemed so much touched and so happy he
was beaming all over with such joyful gratitude that I felt emotion
and joy His face was completely transfigured Little boys of twelve
wear such faces at Easter after the Communion when thickly pomaded
clad in new roundjackets and starched collars they go to exchange the
Easter greeting with their parents Msha kept feeling of himself
cautiously and incredulously and repeatingWhat is this Am not I
in heavenAnd on the following day he announced that he had not been
able to sleep all night for rapture

In my house there was then living an aged aunt with her niece They were
both greatly agitated when they heard of Mshas arrival they did not
understand how I could have invited him to my house He bore a very bad
reputation But in the first place I knew that he was always very
polite to ladies and in the second place I trusted to his promise to
reform And as a matter of fact during the early days of his sojourn
under my roof Msha not only justified my expectations but exceeded
them and he simply enchanted my ladies He played picquet with the old
lady he helped her to wind yarn he showed her two new games of
patience he accompanied the niece who had a small voice on the piano
he read her French and Russian poetry he narrated diverting but
decorous anecdotes to both ladiesin a word he was serviceable to
them in all sorts of ways so that they repeatedly expressed to me their
surprise while the old woman even remarked How unjust people
sometimes are What all have not they said about him  while he is
so discreet and polite  poor Msha

It is true that at table poor Msha licked his lips in a
peculiarlyhasty way every time he even looked at a bottle But all I
had to do was to shake my finger and he would roll up his eyes and
press his hand to his heart  as much as to say I have sworn

I am regenerated now he assured meWell God grant it I thought
to myself But this regeneration did not last long

During the early days he was very loquacious and jolly But beginning
with the third day he quieted down somehow although as before he
kept close to the ladies and amused them A halfsad halfthoughtful
expression began to flit across his face and the face itself grew pale
and thin

Art thou ill I asked him

Yes he answeredmy head aches a little

On the fourth day he became perfectly silent he sat in a corner most of
the time with dejectedly drooping head and by his downcast aspect
evoked a feeling of compassion in the two ladies who now in their
turn tried to divert him At table he ate nothing stared at his
plate and rolled breadballs On the fifth day the feeling of pity in
the ladies began to be replaced by anotherby distrust and even fear
Msha had grown wild he avoided people and kept walking along the wall
as though creeping stealthily and suddenly darting glances around him
as though some one had called him And what had become of his rosy
complexion It seemed to be covered with earth

Art thou still ill I asked him

No I am well he answered abruptly

Art thou bored

Why should I be boredBut he turned away and would not look me in
the eye

Or hast thou grown melancholy againTo this he made no reply

On the following day my aunt ran into my study in a state of great
excitement and declared that she and her niece would leave my house if
Msha were to remain in it

Why so

Why we feel afraid of him He is not a manhe is a wolf a
regular wolf He stalks and stalks about saying never a word and has
such a wild look He all but gnashes his teeth My Ktya is such a
nervous girl as thou knowest She took a great interest in him the
first day I am afraid for her and for myself

I did not know what reply to make to my aunt But I could not expel
Msha whom I had invited in

He himself extricated me from this dilemma

That very daybefore I had even left my studyI suddenly heard a dull
and vicious voice behind me

Nikoli Nikolitch hey there Nikoli Nikolitch

I looked round In the doorway stood Msha with a terrible lowering
distorted visage

Nikoli Nikolitch he repeated  it was no longer dear uncle

What dost thou want

Let me go  this very moment

What

Let me go or I shall commit a crimeset the house on fire or cut
some ones throatMsha suddenly fell to shakingOrder them to
restore my garments and give me a cart to carry me to the highway and
give me a trifling sum of money

But art thou dissatisfied with anything I began

I cannot live thus he roared at the top of his voiceI cannot live
in your lordly thricedamned house I hate I am ashamed to live so
tranquilly How do you manage to endure it

In other words I interposed thou wishest to say that thou canst not
live without liquor

Well yes well yes he yelled againOnly let me go to my
brethren to my friends to the beggars Away from your noble
decorous repulsive race

I wanted to remind him of his promise on oath but the criminal
expression of Mshas face his unrestrained voice the convulsive
trembling of all his limbsall this was so frightful that I made haste
to get rid of him I informed him that he should receive his clothing at
once that a cart should be harnessed for him and taking from a casket
a twentyruble banknote I laid it on the table Msha was already
beginning to advance threateningly upon me but now he suddenly stopped
short his face instantaneously became distorted and flushed up he
smote his breast tears gushed from his eyes and he stammered
UncleAngel I am a lost man you seeThanks ThanksHe
seized the banknote and rushed out of the room

An hour later he was already seated in a cart again clad in his
Circassian coat again rosy and jolly and when the horses started off
he uttered a yell tore off his tall kazk cap and waving it above his
head he made bow after bow Immediately before his departure he
embraced me long and warmly stammeringBenefactor benefactor It
was impossible to save me He even ran in to see the ladies and kissed
their hands over and over again went down on his knees appealed to
God and begged forgiveness I found Ktya in tears later on

But the coachman who had driven Msha reported to me on his return
that he had taken him to the first drinking establishment on the
highway and that there he had got stranded had begun to stand treat
to every one without distinction and had soon arrived at a state of
inebriation

Since that time I have never met Msha but I learned his final fate in
the following manner




VIII


Three years later I again found myself in the country suddenly a
servant entered and announced that Madame Plteff was inquiring for me
I knew no Madame Plteff and the servant who made the announcement was
grinning in a sarcastic sort of way for some reason or other In reply
to my questioning glance he said that the lady who was asking for me was
young poorly clad and had arrived in a peasantcart drawn by one
horse which she was driving herself I ordered that Madame Plteff
should be requested to do me the favour to step into my study

I beheld a woman of fiveandtwentybelonging to the petty burgher
class to judge from her attirewith a large kerchief on her head Her
face was simple rather round in contour not devoid of agreeability
her gaze was downcast and rather melancholy her movements were
embarrassed

Are you Madame Plteff I asked inviting her to be seated

Just so sir she answered in a low voice and without sitting
downI am the widow of your nephew Mikhal Andrevitch Plteff

Is Mikhal Andrevitch dead Has he been dead longBut sit down I
beg of you

She dropped down on a chair

This is the second month since he died

And were you married to him long ago

I lived with him one year in all

And whence come you now

I come from the vicinity of Tla There is a village there called
ZnmenskoeGlshkovoperhaps you deign to know it I am the daughter of
the sexton there Mikhal Andritch and I lived there He settled
down with my father We lived together a year in all The young womans
lips twitched slightly and she raised her hand to them She seemed to
be getting ready to cry but conquered herself and cleared her throat

The late Mikhal Andritch before his death she went on bade me go
to you Be sure to go he said And he told me that I was to thank you
for all your goodness and transmit to you  this  trifle she
drew from her pocket a small package which he always carried on his
person And Mikhal Andritch said Wouldnt you be so kind as to
accept it in memorythat you must not scorn it I have nothing else
to give him  meaning you  he said

In the packet was a small silver cup with the monogram of Mikhals
mother This tiny cup I had often seen in Mikhals hands and once he
had even said to me in speaking of a pauper that he must be stripped
bare since he had neither cup nor bowl while I have this here he
said

I thanked her took the cup and inquired Of what malady did Mikhal
Andritch dieProbably

Here I bit my tongue but the young woman understood my unspoken
thought She darted a swift glance at me then dropped her eyes
smiled sadly and immediately said Akh no He had abandoned that
entirely from the time he made my acquaintance Only what health had
he It was utterly ruined As soon as he gave up drinking his
malady immediately manifested itself He became so steady he was always
wanting to help my father either in the household affairs or in the
vegetable garden  or whatever other work happened to be on hand 
in spite of the fact that he was of noble birth Only where was he to
get the strength And he would have liked to busy himself in the
department of writing alsohe knew how to do that beautifully as you
are aware but his hands shook so and he could not hold the pen
properly He was always reproaching himself Im an idle dog he
said I have done no one any good I have helped no one I have not
toiled He was very much afflicted over that same He used to say
Our people toil but what are we doing Akh Nikoli Nikolitch he
was a fine manand he loved me  and I Akh forgive me

Here the young woman actually burst into tears I would have liked to
comfort her but I did not know how

Have you a baby I asked at last

She sighedNo I have not How could I haveAnd here tears
streamed worse than before

So this was the end of Mshas wanderings through tribulations old P
concluded his storyYou will agree with me gentlemen as a matter of
course that I had a right to call him reckless but you will probably
also agree with me that he did not resemble the reckless fellows of the
present day although we must suppose that any philosopher would find
traits of similarity between him and them In both cases there is the
thirst for selfannihilation melancholy dissatisfaction And what
that springs from I will permit precisely that philosopher to decide







THE DREAM







I


I was living with my mother at the time in a small seaport town I was
just turned seventeen and my mother was only thirtyfive she had
married very young When my father died I was only seven years old but
I remembered him well My mother was a short fairhaired woman with a
charming but permanentlysad face a quiet languid voice and timid
movements In her youth she had borne the reputation of a beauty and as
long as she lived she remained attractive and pretty I have never
beheld more profound tender and melancholy eyes I adored her and she
loved me But our life was not cheerful it seemed as though some
mysterious incurable and undeserved sorrow were constantly sapping the
root of her existence This sorrow could not be explained by grief for
my father alone great as that was passionately as my mother had loved
him sacredly as she cherished his memory No there was something
else hidden there which I did not understand but which I feltfelt
confusedly and strongly as soon as I looked at those quiet impassive
eyes at those very beautiful but also impassive lips which were not
bitterly compressed but seemed to have congealed for good and all

I have said that my mother loved me but there were moments when she
spurned me when my presence was burdensome intolerable to her At such
times she felt as it were an involuntary aversion for meand was
terrified afterward reproaching herself with tears and clasping me to
her heart I attributed these momentary fits of hostility to her
shattered health to her unhappiness These hostile sentiments might
have been evoked it is true in a certain measure by some strange
outbursts which were incomprehensible even to me myself of wicked and
criminal feelings which occasionally arose in me

But these outbursts did not coincide with the moments of repulsionMy
mother constantly wore black as though she were in mourning We lived
on a rather grand scale although we associated with no one




II


My mother concentrated upon me all her thoughts and cares Her life was
merged in my life Such relations between parents and children are not
always good for the children  they are more apt to be injurious
Moreover I was my mothers only child  and only children generally
develop irregularly In rearing them the parents do not think of
themselves so much as they do of them That is not practical I did
not get spoiled and did not grow obstinate both these things happen
with only children but my nerves were unstrung before their time in
addition to which I was of rather feeble healthI took after my mother
to whom I also bore a great facial resemblance I shunned the society of
lads of my own age in general I was shy of people I even talked very
little with my mother I was fonder of reading than of anything else
and of walking aloneand dreaming dreaming What my dreams were about
it would be difficult to say It sometimes seemed to me as though I were
standing before a halfopen door behind which were concealed hidden
secretsstanding and waiting and swooning with longingyet not
crossing the threshold and always meditating as to what there was
yonder ahead of meand always waiting and longing  or falling into
slumber If the poetic vein had throbbed in me I should in all
probability have taken to writing verses if I had felt an inclination
to religious devoutness I might have become a monk but there was
nothing of the sort about me and I continued to dreamand to wait




III


I have just mentioned that I sometimes fell asleep under the inspiration
of obscure thoughts and reveries On the whole I slept a great deal
and dreams played a prominent part in my life I beheld visions almost
every night I did not forget them I attributed to them significance I
regarded them as prophetic I strove to divine their secret import Some
of them were repeated from time to time which always seemed to me
wonderful and strange I was particularly perturbed by one dream It
seems to me that I am walking along a narrow badlypaved street in an
ancient town between manystoried houses of stone with sharppointed
roofs I am seeking my father who is not dead but is for some reason
hiding from us and is living in one of those houses And so I enter a
low dark gate traverse a long courtyard encumbered with beams and
planks and finally make my way into a small chamber with two circular
windows In the middle of the room stands my father clad in a
dressinggown and smoking a pipe He does not in the least resemble my
real father he is tall thin blackhaired he has a hooked nose
surly piercing eyes in appearance he is about forty years of age He
is displeased because I have hunted him up and I also am not in the
least delighted at the meetingand I stand still in perplexity He
turns away slightly begins to mutter something and to pace to and fro
with short steps Then he retreats a little without ceasing to
mutter and keeps constantly casting glances behind him over his
shoulder the room widens out and vanishes in a fog I suddenly grow
terrified at the thought that I am losing my father again I rush after
himbut I no longer see him and can only hear his angry bearlike
growl My heart sinks within me I wake up and for a long time
cannot get to sleep again All the following day I think about that
dream and of course am unable to arrive at any conclusion




IV


The month of June had come The town in which my mother and I lived
became remarkably animated at that season A multitude of vessels
arrived at the wharves a multitude of new faces presented themselves on
the streets I loved at such times to stroll along the quay past the
coffeehouses and inns to scan the varied faces of the sailors and
other people who sat under the canvas awnings at little white tables
with pewter tankards filled with beer

One day as I was passing in front of a coffeehouse I caught sight of
a man who immediately engrossed my entire attention Clad in a long
black coat of peasant cut with a straw hat pulled down over his eyes
he was sitting motionless with his arms folded on his chest Thin
rings of black hair descended to his very nose his thin lips gripped
the stem of a short pipe This man seemed so familiar to me every
feature of his swarthy yellow face his whole figure were so
indubitably stamped on my memory that I could not do otherwise than
halt before him could not help putting to myself the question Who is
this man Where have I seen him He probably felt my intent stare for
he turned his black piercing eyes upon me I involuntarily uttered a
cry of surprise

This man was the father whom I had sought out whom I had beheld in my
dream

There was no possibility of making a mistakethe resemblance was too
striking Even the longskirted coat which enveloped his gaunt limbs
reminded me in colour and form of the dressinggown in which my father
had presented himself to me

Am not I dreaming I thought to myself No It is daylight now
a crowd is roaring round me the sun is shining brightly in the blue
sky and I have before me not a phantom but a living man

I stepped up to an empty table ordered myself a tankard of beer and a
newspaper and seated myself at a short distance from this mysterious
being




V


Placing the sheets of the newspaper on a level with my face I continued
to devour the stranger with my eyesHe hardly stirred and only raised
his drooping head a little from time to time He was evidently waiting
for some one I gazed and gazed Sometimes it seemed to me that I had
invented the whole thing that in reality there was no resemblance
whatever that I had yielded to the semiinvoluntary deception of the
imagination  but he would suddenly turn a little on his chair
raise his hand slightly and again I almost cried aloud again I beheld
before me my nocturnal father At last he noticed my importunate
attention and first with surprise then with vexation he glanced in
my direction started to rise and knocked down a small cane which he
had leaned against the table I instantly sprang to my feet picked it
up and handed it to him My heart was beating violently

He smiled in a constrained way thanked me and putting his face close
to my face he elevated his eyebrows and parted his lips a little as
though something had struck him

You are very polite young man he suddenly began in a dry sharp
snuffling voiceThat is a rarity nowadays Allow me to congratulate
you You have been well brought up

I do not remember precisely what answer I made to him but the
conversation between us was started I learned that he was a
fellowcountryman of mine that he had recently returned from America
where he had lived many years and whither he was intending to return
shortly He said his name was Baron I did not catch the name well
He like my nocturnal father wound up each of his remarks with an
indistinct inward growl He wanted to know my name On hearing it he
again showed signs of surprise Then he asked me if I had been living
long in that town and with whom I answered him that I lived with my
mother

And your father

My father died long ago

He inquired my mothers Christian name and immediately burst into an
awkward laughand then excused himself saying that he had that
American habit and that altogether he was a good deal of an eccentric
Then he asked where we lived I told him




VI


The agitation which had seized upon me at the beginning of our
conversation had gradually subsided I thought our intimacy rather
strangethat was all I did not like the smile with which the baron
questioned me neither did I like the expression of his eyes when he
fairly stabbed them into me There was about them something rapacious
and condescending  something which inspired dread I had not seen
those eyes in my dream The baron had a strange face It was pallid
fatigued and at the same time youthful in appearance but with a
disagreeable youthfulness Neither had my nocturnal father that deep
scar which intersected his whole forehead in a slanting direction and
which I did not notice until I moved closer to him

Before I had had time to impart to the baron the name of the street and
the number of the house where we lived a tall negro wrapped up in a
cloak to his very eyes approached him from behind and tapped him softly
on the shoulder The baron turned round said Aha At last and
nodding lightly to me entered the coffeehouse with the negro I
remained under the awning I wished to wait until the baron should come
out again not so much for the sake of entering again into conversation
with him I really did not know what topic I could start with as for
the purpose of again verifying my first impressionBut half an hour
passed an hour passed The baron did not make his appearance I
entered the coffeehouse I made the circuit of all the roomsbut
nowhere did I see either the baron or the negro Both of them must
have taken their departure through the back door

My head had begun to ache a little and with the object of refreshing
myself I set out along the seashore to the extensive park outside the
town which had been laid out ten years previously After having
strolled for a couple of hours in the shade of the huge oaks and
plaintaintrees I returned home




VII


Our maidservant flew to meet me all tremulous with agitation as soon
as I made my appearance in the anteroom I immediately divined from the
expression of her face that something unpleasant had occurred in our
house during my absenceAnd in fact I learned that half an hour
before a frightful shriek had rung out from my mothers bedroom When
the maid rushed in she found her on the floor in a swoon which lasted
for several minutes My mother had recovered consciousness at last but
had been obliged to go to bed and wore a strange frightened aspect
she had not uttered a word she had not replied to questionsshe had
done nothing but glance around her and tremble The servant had sent the
gardener for a doctor The doctor had come and had prescribed a soothing
potion but my mother had refused to say anything to him either The
gardener asserted that a few moments after the shriek had rung out from
my mothers room he had seen a strange man run hastily across the
flowerplots of the garden to the street gate We lived in a onestory
house whose windows looked out upon a fairly large garden The
gardener had not been able to get a good look at the mans face but the
latter was gaunt and wore a straw hat and a longskirted coat The
barons costume immediately flashed into my headThe gardener had
been unable to overtake him moreover he had been summoned without
delay to the house and despatched for the doctor

I went to my mothers room she was lying in bed whiter than the pillow
on which her head rested At sight of me she smiled faintly and put
out her hand to me I sat down by her side and began to question her
at first she persistently parried my questions but at last she
confessed that she had seen something which had frightened her greatly

Did some one enter here I asked

No she answered hastily no one entered but it seemed to me  I
thought I saw  a vision

She ceased speaking and covered her eyes with her hand I was on the
point of communicating to her what I had heard from the gardenerand
my meeting with the baron also by the way  but for some reason or
other the words died on my lips

Nevertheless I did bring myself to remark to my mother that visions do
not manifest themselves in the daylight

Stop she whispered please stop do not torture me now Some day
thou shalt know Again she relapsed into silence Her hands were
cold and her pulse beat fast and unevenly I gave her a dose of her
medicine and stepped a little to one side in order not to disturb her

She did not rise all day She lay motionless and quiet only sighing
deeply from time to time and opening her eyes in a timorous
fashionEvery one in the house was perplexed




VIII


Toward night a slight fever made its appearance and my mother sent me
away I did not go to my own chamber however but lay down in the
adjoining room on the divan Every quarter of an hour I rose approached
the door on tiptoe and listened Everything remained silentbut my
mother hardly slept at all that night When I went into her room early
in the morning her face appeared to me to be swollen and her eyes were
shining with an unnatural brilliancy In the course of the day she
became a little easier but toward evening the fever increased again

Up to that time she had maintained an obstinate silence but now she
suddenly began to talk in a hurried spasmodic voice She was not
delirious there was sense in her words but there was no coherency in
them Not long before midnight she raised herself up in bed with a
convulsive movement I was sitting beside her and with the same
hurried voice she began to narrate to me continually drinking water in
gulps from a glass feebly flourishing her hands and not once looking
at me the while At times she paused exerted an effort over herself
and went on again All this was strange as though she were doing it
in her sleep as though she herself were not present but as though some
other person were speaking with her lips or making her speak




IX


Listen to what I have to tell thee she began Thou art no longer a
young boy thou must know all I had a good friend She married a man
whom she loved with all her heart and she was happy with her husband
But during the first year of their married life they both went to the
capital to spend a few weeks and enjoy themselves They stopped at a
good hotel and went out a great deal to theatres and assemblies My
friend was very far from homely every one noticed her all the young
men paid court to her but among them was one in particular  an
officer He followed her unremittingly and wherever she went she beheld
his black wicked eyes He did not make her acquaintance and did not
speak to her even once he merely kept staring at her in a very strange
insolent way All the pleasures of the capital were poisoned by his
presence She began to urge her husband to depart as speedily as
possible and they had fully made up their minds to the journey One day
her husband went off to the club some officersofficers who belonged
to the same regiment as this manhad invited him to play cards For
the first time she was left alone Her husband did not return for a long
time she dismissed her maid and went to bed And suddenly a great
dread came upon her so that she even turned cold all over and began to
tremble It seemed to her that she heard a faint tapping on the other
side of the walllike the noise a dog makes when scratchingand she
began to stare at that wall In the corner burned a shrinelamp the
chamber was all hung with silken stuff Suddenly something began to
move at that point rose opened And straight out of the wall all
black and long stepped forth that dreadful man with the wicked eyes

She tried to scream and could not She was benumbed with fright He
advanced briskly toward her like a rapacious wild beast flung
something over her head something stifling heavy and white What
happened afterward I do not remember I do not remember It was like
death like murder When that terrible fog dispersed at lastwhen
I  my friend recovered her senses there was no one in the room
Againand for a long timeshe was incapable of crying out but she did
shriek at last  then again everything grew confused

Then she beheld by her side her husband who had been detained at the
club until two oclock His face was distorted beyond recognition He
began to question her but she said nothing Then she fell ill
But I remember that when she was left alone in the room she examined
that place in the wall Under the silken hangings there proved to be
a secret door And her weddingring had disappeared from her hand This
ring was of an unusual shape Upon it seven tiny golden stars alternated
with seven tiny silver stars it was an ancient family heirloom Her
husband asked her what had become of her ring she could make no reply
Her husband thought that she had dropped it somewhere hunted everywhere
for it but nowhere could he find it Gloom descended upon him he
decided to return home as speedily as possible and as soon as the
doctor permitted they quitted the capital But imagine On the very
day of their departure they suddenly encountered on the street a
litter In that litter lay a man who had just been killed with a
cleft skulland just imagine that man was that same dreadful
nocturnal visitor with the wicked eyes He had been killed over a
game of cards

Then my friend went away to the country and became a mother for the
first time  and lived several years with her husband He never
learned anything about that matter and what could she say She herself
knew nothing But her former happiness had vanished Darkness had
invaded their lifeand that darkness was never dispelled They had
no other children either before or after  but that son

My mother began to tremble all over and covered her face with her
hands

But tell me now she went on with redoubled force whether my friend
was in any way to blame With what could she reproach herself She was
punished but had not she the right to declare in the presence of God
himself that the punishment which overtook her was unjust Then why can
the past present itself to her after the lapse of so many years in so
frightful an aspect as though she were a sinner tortured by the
gnawings of conscience Macbeth slew Banquo so it is not to be
wondered at that he should have visions  but I

But my mothers speech became so entangled and confused that I ceased to
understand her  I no longer had any doubt that she was raving in
delirium




X


Any one can easily understand what a shattering effect my mothers
narration produced upon me I had divined at her very first word that
she was speaking of herself and not of any acquaintance of hers her
slip of the tongue only confirmed me in my surmise So it really was my
father whom I had sought out in my dream whom I had beheld when wide
awake He had not been killed as my mother had supposed but merely
wounded And he had come to her and had fled affrighted by her
fright Everything suddenly became clear to me the feeling of
involuntary repugnance for me which sometimes awoke in my mother and
her constant sadness and our isolated life I remember that my head
reeled and I clutched at it with both hands as though desirous of
holding it firmly in its place But one thought had become riveted in it
like a nail I made up my mind without fail at any cost to find that
man again Why With what objectI did not account to myself for
that but to find him  to find himthat had become for me a question
of life or death

On the following morning my mother regained her composure at last 
the fever passed off  she fell asleep Committing her to the care of
our landlord and landlady and the servants I set out on my quest




XI


First of all as a matter of course I betook myself to the coffeehouse
where I had met the baron but in the coffeehouse no one knew him or
had even noticed him he was a chance visitor The proprietors had
noticed the negrohis figure had been too striking to escape notice
but who he was where he stayed no one knew either Leaving my address
in case of an emergency at the coffeehouse I began to walk about the
streets and the waterfront of the town the wharves the boulevards I
looked into all the public institutions and nowhere did I find any one
who resembled either the baron or his companion As I had not caught
the barons name I was deprived of the possibility of appealing to the
police but I privately gave two or three guardians of public order to
understand they gazed at me in surprise it is true and did not
entirely believe me that I would lavishly reward their zeal if they
should be successful in coming upon the traces of those two individuals
whose personal appearance I tried to describe as minutely as possible

Having strolled about in this manner until dinnertime I returned home
thoroughly worn out My mother had got out of bed but with her habitual
melancholy there was mingled a new element a sort of pensive
perplexity which cut me to the heart like a knife I sat with her all
the evening We said hardly anything she laid out her game of patience
I silently looked at her cards She did not refer by a single word to
her story or to what had happened the day before It was as though we
had both entered into a compact not to touch upon those strange and
terrifying occurrences She appeared to be vexed with herself and
ashamed of what had involuntarily burst from her but perhaps she did
not remember very clearly what she had said in her semifevered
delirium and hoped that I would spare her And in fact I did spare
her and she was conscious of it as on the preceding day she avoided
meeting my eyes

A frightful storm had suddenly sprung up out of doors The wind howled
and tore in wild gusts the windowpanes rattled and quivered
despairing shrieks and groans were borne through the air as though
something on high had broken loose and were flying with mad weeping
over the shaking houses Just before dawn I lost myself in a doze 
when suddenly it seemed to me as though some one had entered my room and
called me had uttered my name not in a loud but in a decided voice I
raised my head and saw no one but strange to relate I not only was
not frightenedI was delighted there suddenly arose within me the
conviction that now I should without fail attain my end I hastily
dressed myself and left the house




XII


The storm had subsided  but its last flutterings could still be felt
It was early there were no people in the streets in many places
fragments of chimneys tiles boards of fences which had been rent
asunder the broken boughs of trees lay strewn upon the ground
What happened at sea last night I involuntarily thought at the sight
of the traces left behind by the storm I started to go to the port but
my feet bore me in another direction as though in obedience to an
irresistible attraction Before ten minutes had passed I found myself in
a quarter of the town which I had never yet visited I was walking not
fast but without stopping step by step with a strange sensation at my
heart I was expecting something remarkable impossible and at the
same time I was convinced that that impossible thing would come to
pass




XIII


And lo it came to pass that remarkable that unexpected thing Twenty
paces in front of me I suddenly beheld that same negro who had spoken to
the baron in my presence at the coffeehouse Enveloped in the same
cloak which I had then noticed on him he seemed to have popped up out
of the earth and with his back turned toward me was walking with brisk
strides along the narrow sidewalk of the crooked alley I immediately
dashed in pursuit of him but he redoubled his gait although he did not
glance behind him and suddenly made an abrupt turn around the corner of
a projecting house I rushed to that corner and turned it as quickly as
the negro had done Marvellous to relate Before me stretched a long
narrow and perfectly empty street the morning mist filled it with its
dim leaden lightbut my gaze penetrated to its very extremity I
could count all its buildings  and not a single living being was
anywhere astir The tall negro in the cloak had vanished as suddenly as
he had appeared I was amazed  but only for a moment Another feeling
immediately took possession of me that street which stretched out
before my eyes all dumb and dead as it wereI recognised it It was
the street of my dream I trembled and shiveredthe morning was so
chillyand instantly without the slightest wavering with a certain
terror of confidence I went onward

I began to seek with my eyes Yes there it is yonder on the right
with a corner projecting on the sidewalkyonder is the house of my
dream yonder is the ancient gate with the stone scrolls on each
side The house is not circular it is true but square  but that
is a matter of no importance I knock at the gate I knock once
twice thrice ever more and more loudly The gate opens slowly with
a heavy screech as though yawning In front of me stands a young
servingmaid with a dishevelled head and sleepy eyes She has evidently
just waked up

Does the baron live here I inquire as I run a swift glance over the
deep narrow courtyard It is there it is all there  there are
the planks which I had seen in my dream

No the maid answers me the baron does not live here

What dost thou mean by that It is impossible

He is not here now He went away yesterday

Whither

To America

To America I involuntarily repeated But he is coming back

The maid looked suspiciously at me

I dont know Perhaps he will not come back at all

But has he been living here long

No not long about a week Now he is not here at all

But what was the family name of that baron

The maidservant stared at me

Dont you know his name We simply called him the baron Hey there
Pitr she cried perceiving that I was pushing my way income
hither some stranger or other is asking all sorts of questions

From the house there presented itself the shambling figure of a robust
labourer

Whats the matter Whats wanted he inquired in a hoarse voiceand
having listened to me with a surly mien he repeated what the
maidservant had said

But who does live here I said

Our master

And who is he

A carpenter They are all carpenters in this street

Can he be seen

Impossible now he is asleep

And cannot I go into the house

No go your way

Well and can I see your master a little later

Why not Certainly He can always be seen Thats his business as a
dealer Only go your way now See how early it is

Well and how about that negro I suddenly asked

The labourer stared in amazement first at me then at the maidservant

What negro he said at lastGo away sir You can come back later
Talk with the master

I went out into the street The gate was instantly banged behind me
heavily and sharply without squeaking this time

I took good note of the street and house and went away but not homeI
felt something in the nature of disenchantment Everything which had
happened to me was so strange so remarkableand yet how stupidly it
had been ended I had been convinced that I should behold in that house
the room which was familiar to meand in the middle of it my father
the baron in a dressinggown and with a pipe And instead of that
the master of the house was a carpenter and one might visit him as much
as one pleasedand order furniture of him if one wished

But my father had gone to America And what was left for me to do
now Tell my mother everything or conceal forever the very memory of
that meeting I was absolutely unable to reconcile myself to the thought
that such a senseless such a commonplace ending should be tacked on to
such a supernatural mysterious beginning

I did not wish to return home and walked straight ahead following my
nose out of the town




XIV


I walked along with drooping head without a thought almost without
sensation but wholly engrossed in myselfA measured dull and angry
roar drew me out of my torpor I raised my head it was the sea roaring
and booming fifty paces from me Greatly agitated by the nocturnal
storm the sea was a mass of whitecaps to the very horizon and steep
crests of long breakers were rolling in regularly and breaking on the
flat shore I approached it and walked along the very line left by the
ebb and flow on the yellow ribbed sand strewn with fragments of
trailing seawrack bits of shells serpentlike ribbons of eelgrass
Sharpwinged gulls with pitiful cry borne on the wind from the distant
aerial depths soared white as snow against the grey cloudy sky
swooped down abruptly and as though skipping from wave to wave
departed again and vanished like silvery flecks in the strips of
swirling foam Some of them I noticed circled persistently around a
large isolated boulder which rose aloft in the midst of the monotonous
expanse of sandy shores Coarse seaweed grew in uneven tufts on one side
of the rock and at the point where its tangled stems emerged from the
yellow saltmarsh there was something black and long and arched and
not very large I began to look more intently Some dark object
was lying therelying motionless beside the stone That object
became constantly clearer and more distinct the nearer I approached

I was only thirty paces from the rock now Why that was the outline
of a human body It was a corpse it was a drowned man cast up by the
sea I went clear up to the rock

It was the corpse of the baron my father I stopped short as though
rooted to the spot Then only did I understand that ever since daybreak
I had been guided by some unknown forcesthat I was in their
powerand for the space of several minutes there was nothing in my
soul save the ceaseless crashing of the sea and a dumb terror in the
presence of the Fate which held me in its grip




XV


He was lying on his back bent a little to one side with his left arm
thrown above his head  the right was turned under his bent body The
sticky slime had sucked in the tips of his feet shod in tall sailors
boots the short blue peajacket all impregnated with seasalt had not
unbuttoned a red scarf encircled his neck in a hard knot The swarthy
face turned skyward seemed to be laughing from beneath the upturned
upper lip small closeset teeth were visible the dim pupils of the
halfclosed eyes were hardly to be distinguished from the darkened
whites covered with bubbles of foam the dirtencrusted hair spread out
over the ground and laid bare the smooth forehead with the purplish line
of the scar the narrow nose rose up like a sharp white streak between
the sunken cheeks The storm of the past night had done its work He
had not beheld America The man who had insulted my mother who had
marred her life my fatheryes my father I could cherish no doubt as
to thatlay stretched out helpless in the mud at my feet I experienced
a sense of satisfied vengeance and compassion and repulsion and
terror most of all  of twofold terror terror of what I had seen and
of what had come to pass That evil that criminal element of which I
have already spoken those incomprehensible spasms rose up within
me  stifled me

Aha I thought to myself so that is why I am what I am That is
where blood tells I stood beside the corpse and gazed and waited to
see whether those dead pupils would not stir whether those benumbed
lips would not quiver No everything was motionless the very seaweed
among which the surf had cast him seemed to have congealed even the
gulls had flown awaythere was not a fragment anywhere not a plank or
any broken rigging There was emptiness everywhere  only heand
Iand the foaming sea in the distance I cast a glance behind me the
same emptiness was there a chain of hillocks on the horizon  that
was all

I dreaded to leave that unfortunate man in that loneliness in the ooze
of the shore to be devoured by fishes and birds an inward voice told
me that I ought to hunt up some men and call them thither if not to
aidthat was out of the questionat least for the purpose of laying
him out of bearing him beneath an inhabited roof But indescribable
terror suddenly took possession of me It seemed to me as though that
dead man knew that I had come thither that he himself had arranged that
last meetingit even seemed as though I could hear that dull familiar
muttering I ran off to one side  looked behind me once more
Something shining caught my eye it brought me to a standstill It was
a golden hoop on the outstretched hand of the corpse I recognised my
mothers weddingring I remember how I forced myself to return to go
close to bend down I remember the sticky touch of the cold fingers
I remember how I panted and puckered up my eyes and gnashed my teeth as
I tugged persistently at the ring

At last I got it offand I fledfled away in headlong flightand
something darted after me and overtook me and caught me




XVI


Everything which I had gone through and endured was probably written
on my face when I returned home My mother suddenly rose upright as soon
as I entered her room and gazed at me with such insistent inquiry that
after having unsuccessfully attempted to explain myself I ended by
silently handing her the ring She turned frightfully pale her eyes
opened unusually wide and turned dim like hisShe uttered a faint
cry seized the ring reeled fell upon my breast and fairly swooned
there with her head thrown back and devouring me with those wide mad
eyes I encircled her waist with both arms and standing still on one
spot never stirring I slowly narrated everything without the
slightest reservation to her in a quiet voice my dream and the
meeting and everything everything She heard me out to the end
only her breast heaved more and more strongly and her eyes suddenly
grew more animated and drooped Then she put the ring on her fourth
finger and retreating a little began to get out a mantilla and a hat
I asked where she was going She raised a surprised glance to me and
tried to answer but her voice failed her She shuddered several times
rubbed her hands as though endeavouring to warm herself and at last she
said Let us go at once thither

Whither mother dear

Where he is lying I want to see  I want to know  I shall
identify

I tried to persuade her not to go but she was almost in hysterics I
understood that it was impossible to oppose her desire and we set out




XVII


And lo again I am walking over the sand of the dunes but I am no
longer alone I am walking arm in arm with my mother The sea has
retreated has gone still further away it is quieting down but even
its diminished roar is menacing and ominous Here at last the solitary
rock has shown itself ahead of usand there is the seaweed I look
intently I strive to distinguish that rounded object lying on the
groundbut I see nothing We approach closer I involuntarily retard my
steps But where is that black motionless thing Only the stalks of the
seaweed stand out darkly against the sand which is already dry We
go to the very rock The corpse is nowhere to be seen and only on
the spot where it had lain there still remains a depression and one can
make out where the arms and legs lay Round about the seaweed seems
tousled and the traces of one mans footsteps are discernible they go
across the down then disappear on reaching the flinty ridge

My mother and I exchange glances and are ourselves frightened at what we
read on our own faces

Can he have got up of himself and gone away

But surely thou didst behold him dead she asks in a whisper

I can only nod my head Three hours have not elapsed since I stumbled
upon the barons body Some one had discovered it and carried it
awayI must find out who had done it and what had become of him

But first of all I must attend to my mother




XVIII


While she was on her way to the fatal spot she was in a fever but she
controlled herself The disappearance of the corpse had startled her as
the crowning misfortune She was stupefied I feared for her reason
With great difficulty I got her home I put her to bed again again I
called the doctor for her but as soon as my mother partly recovered her
senses she at once demanded that I should instantly set out in search of
that man I obeyed But despite all possible measures I discovered
nothing I went several times to the policeoffice I visited all the
villages in the neighbourhood I inserted several advertisements in the
newspapers I made inquiries in every directionall in vain It is true
that I did hear that a drowned man had been found at one of the hamlets
on the seashore I immediately hastened thither but he was already
buried and from all the tokens he did not resemble the baron I found
out on what ship he had sailed for America At first every one was
positive that that ship had perished during the tempest but several
months afterward rumours began to circulate to the effect that it had
been seen at anchor in the harbour of New York Not knowing what to do
I set about hunting up the negro whom I had seenI offered him
through the newspapers a very considerable sum of money if he would
present himself at our house A tall negro in a cloak actually did come
to the house in my absence But after questioning the servantmaid
he suddenly went away and returned no more

And thus the trace of my  my father grew cold thus did it vanish
irrevocably in the mute gloom My mother and I never spoke of him Only
one day I remember that she expressed surprise at my never having
alluded before to my strange dream and then she added Of course it
really  and did not finish her sentence

My mother was ill for a long time and after her convalescence our
former relations were not restablished She felt awkward in my presence
until the day of her death Precisely that awkward And there was no
way of helping her in her grief Everything becomes smoothed down the
memories of the most tragic family events gradually lose their force and
venom but if a feeling of awkwardness has been set up between two
closelyconnected persons it is impossible to extirpate it

I have never again had that dream which had been wont so to disturb me
I no longer search for my father but it has sometimes seemed to
meand it seems so to me to this daythat in my sleep I hear distant
shrieks unintermittent melancholy plaints they resound somewhere
behind a lofty wall across which it is impossible to clamber they
rend my heartand I am utterly unable to comprehend what it is whether
it is a living man groaning or whether I hear the wild prolonged roar
of the troubled sea And now it passes once more into that beastlike
growland I awake with sadness and terror in my soul






FATHER ALEXYIS STORY






Twenty years ago I was obligedin my capacity of private inspectorto
make the circuit of all my aunts rather numerous estates The parish
priests with whom I regarded it as my duty to make acquaintance proved
to be individuals of pretty much one pattern and made after one model
as it were At length in about the last of the estates which I was
inspecting I hit upon a priest who did not resemble his brethren He
was a very aged man almost decrepit and had it not been for the urgent
entreaties of his parishioners who loved and respected him he would
long before have petitioned to be retired that he might rest Two
peculiarities impressed me in Father Alexyi that was the priests
name In the first place he not only asked nothing for himself but
announced plainly that he required nothing and in the second place I
have never beheld in any human face a more sorrowful thoroughly
indifferentwhat is called an overwhelmedexpression The features
of that face were of the ordinary rustic type a wrinkled forehead
small grey eyes a large nose a wedgeshaped beard a swarthy
sunburned skin But the expression  the expression In that
dim gaze life barely burned and sadly at that and his voice also was
somehow lifeless and dim

I fell ill and kept my bed for several days Father Alexyi dropped in
to see me in the evenings not to chat but to play fool The game
of cards seemed to divert him more than it did me One day after having
been left the fool several times in succession which delighted Father
Alexyi not a little I turned the conversation on his past life on
the afflictions which had left on him such manifest traces Father
Alexyi remained obdurate for a long time at first but ended by
relating to me his story He must have taken a liking to me for some
reason or other Otherwise he would not have been so frank with me

I shall endeavour to transmit his story in his own words Father Alexyi
talked very simply and intelligently without any seminary or provincial
tricks and turns of speech It was not the first time I had noticed that
Russians of all classes and callings who have been violently shattered
and humbled express themselves precisely in such language

 I had a good and sedate wife thus he began I loved her heartily
and we begat eight children One of my sons became a bishop and died
not so very long ago in his diocese I shall now tell you about my
other sonYkoff was his name I sent him to the seminary in the town
of T and soon began to receive the most comforting reports about
him He was the best pupil in all the branches Even at home in his
boyhood he had been distinguished for his diligence and discretion a
whole day would sometimes pass without ones hearing him  he would be
sitting all the time over his book reading He never caused me and my
wife the slightest displeasure he was a meek lad Only sometimes he
was thoughtful beyond his years and his health was rather weak Once
something remarkable happened to him He left the house at daybreak on
St Peters day and was gone almost all the morning At last he
returned My wife and I ask him Where hast thou been

I have been for a ramble in the forest says he and there I met a
certain little green old man who talked a great deal with me and gave
me such savoury nuts

What little green old man art thou talking about we ask him

I dont know says he I never saw him before He was a little old
man with a hump and he kept shifting from one to the other of his
little feet and laughingand he was all green just like a leaf

What say we and was his face green also

Yes his face and his hair and even his eyes

Our son had never lied to us but this time my wife and I had our
doubts

Thou must have fallen asleep in the forest in the heat of the day and
have seen that old man in thy dreams

I wasnt asleep at all says he Why dont you believe me says
he See here I have one of the nuts left in my pocket

Ykoff pulled the nut out of his pocket and showed it to usThe kernel
was small in the nature of a chestnut and rather rough it did not
resemble our ordinary nuts I laid it aside and intended to show it to
the doctor  but it got lost I did not find it again

Well sir so we sent him to the seminary and as I have already
informed you he rejoiced us by his success So my spouse and I assumed
that he would turn out a fine man When he came for a sojourn at home it
was a pleasure to look at him he was so comely and there was no
mischief about himevery one liked him every one congratulated us
Only he was still rather thin of body and there was no real good
rosiness in his face So then he was already in his nineteenth year
and his education would soon be finished When suddenly we receive from
him a letterHe writes to us Dear father and mother be not wroth
with me permit me to be a layman my heart does not incline to the
ecclesiastical profession I dread the responsibility I am afraid I
shall sindoubts have taken hold upon me Without your parental
permission and blessing I shall venture on nothingbut one thing I will
tell you I am afraid of myself for I have begun to think a great
deal

I assure you my dear sir that this letter made me very sadas though
a boarspear had pricked my heartfor I saw that I should have no one
to take my place My eldest son was a monk and this one wanted to
abandon his vocation altogether I was also pained because priests from
our family have lived in our parish for close upon two hundred years
But I thought to myself Theres no use in kicking against the pricks
evidently so it was predestined for him What sort of a pastor would he
be if he has admitted doubt to his mind I took counsel with my wife
and wrote to him in the following sense

Think it over well my son Ykoff measure ten times before you cut
off oncethere are great difficulties in the worldly service cold and
hunger and scorn for our caste And thou must know beforehand that no
one will lend a hand to aid so see to it that thou dost not repine
afterward My desire as thou knowest has always been that thou
shouldst succeed me but if thou really hast come to cherish doubts as
to thy calling and hast become unsteady in the faith then it is not my
place to restrain thee The Lords will be done Thy mother and I will
not refuse thee our blessing

Ykoff answered me with a grateful letter Thou hast rejoiced me dear
father said he It is my intention to devote myself to the profession
of learning and I have some protection I shall enter the university
and become a doctor for I feel a strong bent for science I read
Yshkas letter and became sadder than before but I did not share my
grief with any one My old woman caught a severe cold about that time
and diedfrom that same cold or the Lord took her to Himself because
He loved her I know not which I used to weep and weep because I was a
lonely widowerbut what help was there for that So it had to be
you know And I would have been glad to go into the earth  but it is
hard  it will not open And I was expecting my son for he had
notified me Before I go to Moscow he said I shall look in at
home And he did come to the parental roof but did not remain there
long It seemed as though something were urging him on he would have
liked apparently to fly on wings to Moscow to his beloved university
I began to question him as to his doubts What was the cause of them
I asked But I did not get much out of him One idea had pushed itself
into his head and that was the end of it I want to help my
neighbours he saidWell sir he left me I dont believe he took a
penny with him only a few clothes He had such reliance on himself And
not without reason He passed an excellent examination matriculated as
student obtained lessons in private houses He was very strong on
the ancient languages And what think you He took it into his head to
send me money I cheered up a littlenot on account of the money of
courseI sent that back to him and even scolded him but I cheered up
because I saw that the young fellow would make his way in the world But
my rejoicing did not last long

He came to me for his first vacation And what marvel is this I do
not recognise my Ykoff He had grown so tiresome and surlyyou
couldnt get a word out of him And his face had changed also he had
grown about ten years older He had been taciturn before theres no
denying that At the slightest thing he would grow shy and blush like a
girl But when he raised his eyes you could see that all was bright
in his soul But now it was quite different He was not shy but he held
aloof like a wolf and was always looking askance He had neither a
smile nor a greeting for any onehe was just like a stone If I
undertook to interrogate him he would either remain silent or snarl I
began to wonder whether he had taken to drinkwhich God forbidor had
conceived a passion for cards or whether something in the line of a
weakness for women had happened to him In youth lovelongings act
powerfullywell and in such a large city as Moscow bad examples and
occasions are not lacking But no nothing of that sort was discernible
His drink was kvas and water he never looked at the female sexand
had no intercourse with people in general And what was most bitter of
all to me he did not have his former confidence in me a sort of
indifference had made its appearance just as though everything belonging
to him had become loathsome to him I turned the conversation on the
sciences on the university but even there could get no real answer He
went to church but he was not devoid of peculiarities there also
everywhere he was grim and scowling but in church he seemed always
to be grinning

After this fashion he spent six weeks with me then went back to Moscow
From Moscow he wrote to me twice and it seemed to me from his letters
as though he were regaining his sensibilities But picture to yourself
my surprise my dear sir Suddenly in the very middle of the winter
just before the Christmas holidays he presents himself before me

How didst thou get here How is this Whats the matter I know that
thou hast no vacation at this timeDost thou come from MoscowI
ask

Yes

And how about  the university

I have left the university

Thou hast left it

Just so

For good

For good

But art thou ill pray Ykoff

No father says he I am not ill but just dont bother me and
question me dear father or I will go away from hereand thats the
last thou wilt ever see of me

Ykoff tells me that he is not ill but his face is such that I am
fairly frightened It was dreadful darknot human actuallyHis
cheeks were drawn his cheekbones projected he was mere skin and bone
his voice sounded as though it proceeded from a barrel  while his
eyes O Lord and Master what eyesmenacing wild incessantly
darting from side to side and it was impossible to catch them his
brows were knit his lips seemed to be twisted on one side What had
happened to my Joseph Most Fair to my quiet lad I cannot
comprehend it Can he have gone crazy I say to myself He roams about
like a spectre by night he does not sleepand then all of a sudden
he will take to staring into a corner as though he were completely
benumbed It was enough to scare one

Although he had threatened to leave the house if I did not leave him in
peace yet surely I was his father My last hope was ruinedyet I was
to hold my tongue So one day availing myself of an opportunity I
began to entreat Ykoff with tears I began to adjure him by the memory
of his dead mother

Tell me I said as thy father in the flesh and in the spirit Ysha
what aileth thee Do not kill me explain thyself lighten thy heart
Can it be that thou hast ruined some Christian soul If so repent

Well dear father he suddenly says to me this took place toward
nightfall thou hast moved me to compassion I will tell thee the
whole truth I have not ruined any Christian soulbut my own soul is
going to perdition

How is that

In this way And thereupon Ykoff raised his eyes to mine for the
first timeIt is going on four months now he began But suddenly
he broke off and began to breathe heavily

What about the fourth month Tell me do not make me suffer

This is the fourth month that I have been seeing him

Him Who is he

Why the person  whom it is awkward to mention at night

I fairly turned cold all over and fell to quaking

What I said dost thou see him

Yes

And dost thou see him now

Yes

Where And I did not dare to turn round and we both spoke in a
whisper

Why yonder  and he indicated the spot with his eyes  yonder
in the corner

I summoned up my courage and looked at the corner there was nothing
there

Why good gracious there is nothing there Ykoff

Thou dost not see him but I do

Again I glanced round  again nothing Suddenly there recurred to my
mind the little old man in the forest who had given him the chestnut
What does he look like I said Is he green

No he is not green but black

Has he horns

No he is like a manonly all black

As Ykoff speaks he displays his teeth in a grin and turns as pale as a
corpse and huddles up to me in terror and his eyes seem on the point
of popping out of his head and he keeps staring at the corner

Why it is a shadow glimmering faintly I say That is the blackness
from a shadow but thou mistakest it for a man

Nothing of the sortAnd I see his eyes now he is rolling up the
whites now he is raising his hand he is calling me

Ykoff Ykoff thou shouldst try to pray this obsession would
disperse Let God arise and His enemies shall be scattered

I have tried says he but it has no effect

Wait wait Ykoff do not lose thy courage I will fumigate with
incense I will recite a prayer I will sprinkle holy water around
thee

Ykoff merely waved his hand I believe neither in thy incense nor in
holy water they dont help worth a farthing I cannot get rid of him
now Ever since he came to me last summer on one accursed day he has
been my constant visitor and he cannot be driven away Understand this
father and do not wonder any longer at my behaviourand do not torment
me

On what day did he come to thee I ask him and all the while I am
making the sign of the cross over him Was it not when thou didst write
about thy doubts

Ykoff put away my hand

Let me alone dear father says he dont excite me to wrath lest
worse should come of it Im not far from laying hands on myself as it
is

You can imagine my dear sir how I felt when I heard that I
remember that I wept all night How have I deserved such wrath from the
Lord I thought to myself

At this point Father Alexyi drew from his pocket a checked handkerchief
and began to blow his nose and stealthily wiped his eyes by the way

A bad time began for us then he went on I could think of but one
thing how to prevent him from running away orwhich the Lord
forbidof actually doing himself some harm I watched his every step
and was afraid to enter into conversationAnd there dwelt near us at
that time a neighbour the widow of a colonel Mrfa Svishna was her
name I cherished a great respect for her because she was a quiet
sensible woman in spite of the fact that she was young and comely I
was in the habit of going to her house frequently and she did not
despise my vocation Not knowing in my grief and anguish what to
do I just told her all about itAt first she was greatly alarmed and
even thoroughly frightened but later on she became thoughtful For a
long time she deigned to sit thus in silence and then she expressed a
wish to see my son and converse with him And I felt that I ought
without fail to comply with her wish for it was not feminine curiosity
which prompted it in this case but something else

On returning home I began to persuade Ykoff Come with me to see the
colonels widow I said to him

He began to flourish his legs and arms

I wont go to her says he not on any account What shall I talk to
her about He even began to shout at me But at last I conquered him
and hitching up my little sledge I drove him to Mrfa Svishnas and
according to our compact I left him alone with her I was surprised at
his having consented so speedily Well never mindwe shall see Three
or four hours later my Ykoff returns

Well I ask how did our little neighbour please thee

He made me no answer I asked him again

She is a virtuous woman I saidI suppose she was amiable with
thee

Yes he says she is not like the others

I saw that he seemed to have softened a little And I made up my mind to
question him then and there

And how about the obsession I said

Ykoff looked at me as though I had lashed him with a whip and again
made no reply I did not worry him further and left the room and an
hour later I went to the door and peeped through the keyhole And
what do you thinkMy Ysha was asleep He was lying on the couch and
sleeping I crossed myself several times in succession May the Lord
send Mrfa Svishna every blessing I said Evidently she has managed
to touch his embittered heart the dear little dove

The next day I see Ykoff take his cap I think to myself Shall I
ask him whither he is goingBut no better not ask  it certainly
must be to her And in point of fact Ykoff did set off for Mrfa
Svishnas houseand sat with her still longer than before and on the
day following he did it again Then again the next day but one My
spirits began to revive for I saw that a change was coming over my son
and his face had grown quite different and it was becoming possible to
look into his eyes he did not turn away He was just as depressed as
ever but his former despair and terror had disappeared But before I
had recovered my cheerfulness to any great extent everything again broke
off short Ykoff again became wild and again it was impossible to
approach him He sat locked up in his little room and went no more to
the widows

Can it be possible I thought that he has hurt her feelings in some
way and she has forbidden him the houseBut no I thought 
although he is unhappy he would not dare to do such a thing and
besides she is not that sort of woman

At last I could endure it no longer and I interrogated him Well
Ykoff how about our neighbour Apparently thou hast forgotten her
altogether

But he fairly roared at meOur neighbour Dost thou want him to
jeer at me

What I sayThen he even clenched his fists and  got perfectly
furious

Yes he says and formerly he had only towered up after a fashion but
now he began to laugh and show his teethAway Begone

To whom these words were addressed I know not My legs would hardly bear
me forth to such a degree was I frightened Just imagine his face was
the colour of red copper he was foaming at the mouth his voice was
hoarse exactly as though some one were choking him And that very
same day I wentI the orphan of orphansto Mrfa Svishna  and
found her in great affliction Even her outward appearance had undergone
a change she had grown thin in the face But she would not talk with me
about my son Only one thing she did say that no human aid could effect
anything in that case Pray father she saidand then she presented
me with one hundred rublesfor the poor and sick of your parish she
said And again she repeated PrayO Lord As if I had not prayed
without thatprayed day and night

Here Father Alexyi again pulled out his handkerchief and again wiped
away his tears but not by stealth this time and after resting for a
little while he resumed his cheerless narrative

Ykoff and I then began to descend as a snowball rolls down hill and
both of us could see that an abyss lay at the foot of the hill but how
were we to hold back and what measures could we take And it was
utterly impossible to conceal this my entire parish was greatly
disturbed and said The priests son has gone mad he is possessed of
devilsand the authorities ought to be informed of all thisAnd
people infallibly would have informed the authorities had not my
parishioners taken pity on me  for which I thank them In the
meantime winter was drawing to an end and spring was approachingAnd
such a spring as God sentfair and bright such as even the old people
could not remember the sun shone all day long there was no wind and
the weather was warm And then a happy thought occurred to me to
persuade Ykoff to go off with me to do reverence to Mitrofny in
Vornezh If that last remedy is of no avail I thought well then
there is but one hope leftthe grave

So I was sitting one day on the porch just before evening and the
sunset glow was flaming in the sky and the larks were warbling and the
appletrees were in bloom and the grass was growing green I was
sitting and meditating how I could communicate my intention to Ykoff
Suddenly lo and behold he came out on the porch he stood gazed
around sighed and sat down on the step by my side I was even
frightened out of joy but I did nothing except hold my tongue But he
sits and looks at the sunset glow and not a word does he utter either
But it seemed to me as though he had become softened the furrows on his
brow had been smoothed away his eyes had even grown bright A little
more it seemed and a tear would have burst forth On beholding such a
change in him Iexcuse megrew bold

Ykoff I said to him do thou hearken to me without anger And
then I informed him of my intention how we were both to go to Saint
Mitrofny on foot and it is about one hundred and fifty versts to
Vornezh from our parts and how pleasant it would be for us two in the
spring chill having risen before dawn to walk and walk over the green
grass along the highway and how if we made proper obeisance and
prayed before the shrine of the holy man perhapswho knowsthe Lord
God would show mercy upon us and he would receive healing of which
there had already been many instances And just imagine my happiness my
dear sir

Very well says Ykoff only he does not turn round but keeps on
gazing at the skyI consent Let us go

I was fairly stupefied

My friend I say my dear little dove my benefactor But he asks
me

When shall we set out

Why tomorrow if thou wilt I say

So on the following day we started We slung wallets over our shoulders
took staves in our hands and set forth For seven whole days we trudged
on and all the while the weather favoured us and was even downright
wonderful There was neither sultry heat nor rain the flies did not
bite the dust did not make us itch And every day my Ykoff acquired a
better aspect I must tell you that Ykoff had not been in the habit of
seeing that one in the open air but had felt him behind him close to
his back or his shadow had seemed to be gliding alongside which
troubled my son greatly But on this occasion nothing of that sort
happened and nothing made its appearance We talked very little
together  but how greatly at our ease we feltespecially I I saw
that my poor boy was coming to life again I cannot describe to you my
dear sir what my feelings were thenWell we reached Vornezh at
last We cleaned up ourselves and washed ourselves and went to the
cathedral to the holy man For three whole days we hardly left the
temple How many prayerservices we celebrated how many candles we
placed before the holy pictures And everything was going well
everything was fine the days were devout the nights were tranquil my
Ykoff slept like an infant He began to talk to me of his own accord
He would ask Dost thou see nothing father dear and smile No I
see nothing I would answerWhat more could be demanded My gratitude
to the saint was unbounded

Three days passed I said to Ykoff Well now dear son the matter
has been set in order theres a festival in our street One thing
remains to be done do thou make thy confession and receive the
communion and then with Gods blessing we will go our way and after
having got duly rested and worked a bit on the farm to increase thy
strength thou mayest bestir thyself and find a placeand Mrfa
Svishna will certainly help us in that I said

No said Ykoff why should we trouble her But I will take her a
ring from Mitrofnys hand

Thereupon I was greatly encouraged See to it I said that thou
takest a silver ring not a gold onenot a weddingring

My Ykoff flushed up and merely repeated that it was not proper to
trouble her but immediately assented to all the restWe went to the
cathedral on the following day my Ykoff made his confession and
prayed so fervently before it And then he went forward to take the
communion I was standing a little to one side and did not feel the
earth under me for joy It is no sweeter for the angels in heaven
But as I lookwhat is the meaning of thatMy Ykoff has received the
communion but does not go to sip the warm water and wine He is
standing with his back to me I go to him

Ykoff I say why art thou standing here

He suddenly wheels round Will you believe it I sprang back so
frightened was IHis face had been dreadful before but now it had
become ferocious frightful He was as pale as death his hair stood on
end his eyes squinted I even lost my voice with terror I tried to
speak and could not I was perfectly benumbed And he fairly rushed
out of the church I ran after him  but he fled straight to the
tavern where we had put up flung his wallet over his shoulder and away
he flew

Whither I shouted to him Ykoff what aileth thee Stop wait

But Ykoff never uttered a word in reply to me but ran like a hare and
it was utterly impossible to overtake him He disappeared from sight I
immediately turned back hired a cart and trembled all over and all I
could say was O Lord and O Lord And I understood nothing some
calamity had descended upon us I set out for home for I thought He
has certainly fled thitherAnd so he had Six versts out of the town
I espied him he was striding along the highway I overtook him jumped
out of the cart and rushed to him

Ysha YshaHe halted turned his face toward me but kept his eyes
fixed on the ground and compressed his lips And say what I would to
him he stood there just like a statue and one could just see that he
was breathing And at last he trudged on again along the highwayWhat
was there to do I followed him

Akh what a journey that was my dear sir Great as had been our joy on
the way to Vornezh just so great was the horror of the return I would
try to speak to him and he would begin to gnash his teeth at me over
his shoulder precisely like a tiger or a hyena Why I did not go mad I
do not understand to this day And at last one night in a peasants
chickenhouse he was sitting on the platform over the oven and dangling
his feet and gazing about on all sides when I fell on my knees before
him and began to weep and besought him with bitter entreaty

Do not slay thy old father outright I said do not let him fall
into despairtell me what has happened to thee

He glanced at me as though he did not see who was before him and
suddenly began to speak but in such a voice that it rings in my ears
even now

Listen daddy said he Dost thou wish to know the whole truth When
I had taken the communion thou wilt remember and still held the
particle in my mouth suddenly he and that was in the church in
the broad daylight stood in front of me just as though he had sprung
out of the ground and whispered to me  but he had never spoken to
me beforewhispered Spit it out and grind it to powder I did so
I spat it out and ground it under foot And now it must be that I am
lost forever for every sin shall be forgiven save the sin against the
Holy Spirit

And having uttered these dreadful words my son threw himself back on
the platform and I dropped down on the floor of the hut My legs
failed me

Father Alexyi paused for a moment and covered his eyes with his hand

But why should I weary you longer he went on and myself My son and I
dragged ourselves home and there he soon afterward expired and I lost
my Ysha For several days before his death he neither ate nor drank
but kept running back and forth in the room and repeating that there
could be no forgiveness for his sin But he never saw him again
He has ruined my soul he said and why should he come any more
now And when Ykoff took to his bed he immediately sank into
unconsciousness and thus without repentance like a senseless worm
he went from this life to life eternal

But I will not believe that the Lord judged harshly

And among other reasons why I do not believe it is that he looked so
well in his coffin he seemed to have grown young again and resembled
the Ykoff of days gone by His face was so tranquil and pure his hair
curled in little rings and there was a smile on his lips Mrfa
Svishna came to look at him and said the same thing She encircled him
all round with flowers and laid flowers on his heart and set up the
gravestone at her own expense

And I was left alone And that is why my dear sir you have beheld
such great grief on my face It will never pass offand it cannot

I wanted to speak a word of comfort to Father Alexyi  but could
think of none We parted soon after






OLD PORTRAITS






About forty versts from our village there dwelt many years ago the
greatuncle of my mother a retired Sergeant of the Guards and a fairly
wealthy landed proprietor Alexyi Sergyitch Telygin on his ancestral
estate Sukhodl He never went anywhere himself and therefore did not
visit us but I was sent to pay my respects to him a couple of times a
year at first with my governor and later on alone Alexyi Sergyitch
always received me very cordially and I spent three or four days with
him He was already an old man when I made his acquaintance I remember
that I was twelve years old at my first visit and he was already over
seventy He had been born under the Empress Elizabeth in the last year
of her reign He lived alone with his wife Malnya Pvlovna she was
ten years younger than he They had had two daughters who had been
married long before and rarely visited Sukhodl there had been
quarrels between them and their parents and Alexyi Sergyitch
hardly ever mentioned them

I see that ancient truly noble steppe home as though it stood before me
now Of one story with a huge mezzanine erected at the beginning
of the present century from wonderfully thick pine beamssuch beams
were brought at that epoch from the Zhzdrin pine forests there is no
trace of them nowadaysit was very spacious and contained a multitude
of rooms which were decidedly lowceiled and dark it is true and the
windows were mere slits in the walls for the sake of warmth As was
proper the offices and the houseserfs cottages surrounded the
manorhouse on all sides and a park adjoined it small but with fine
fruittrees pellucid apples and seedless pears for ten versts round
about stretched out the flat blackloam steppe There was no lofty
object for the eye neither a tree nor a belfry only here and there a
windmill reared itself aloft with holes in its wings it was a regular
Sukhodl Dry Valley Inside the house the rooms were filled with
ordinary plain furniture rather unusual was a verstpost which stood
on a windowsill in the hall and bore the following inscription

If thou walkest  times around this hall thou wilt have gone a
verst if thou goest  times from the extreme corner of the
drawingroom to the right corner of the billiardroom thou wilt have
gone a verstand so forth But what most impressed the guest who
arrived for the first time was the great number of pictures hung on the
walls for the most part the work of socalled Italian masters ancient
landscapes and mythological and religious subjects But as all these
pictures had turned very black and had even become warped all that met
the eye was patches of fleshcolour or a billowy red drapery on an
invisible bodyor an arch which seemed suspended in the air or a
dishevelled tree with blue foliage or the bosom of a nymph with a large
nipple like the cover of a souptureen a sliced watermelon with black
seeds a turban with a feather above a horses head or the gigantic
lightbrown leg of some apostle or other with a muscular calf and
upturned toes suddenly protruded itself In the drawingroom in the
place of honour hung a portrait of the Empress Katherine II full
length a copy from Lampis wellknown portraitthe object of special
reverence one may say adoration for the master of the house From the
ceiling depended crystal chandeliers in bronze fittings very small and
very dusty

Alexyi Sergyitch himself was a very squat potbellied little old
man with a plump but agreeable face all of one colour with sunken
lips and very vivacious little eyes beneath lofty eyebrows He brushed
his scanty hair over the back of his head it was only since the year
 that he had discarded powder Alexyi Sergyitch always wore a grey
redingote with three capes which fell over his shoulders a striped
waistcoat chamoisleather breeches and darkred morocco short boots
with a heartshaped cleft and a tassel at the top of the leg he wore a
white muslin neckerchief a frill lace cuffs and two golden English
onions one in each pocket of his waistcoat In his right hand he
generally held an enamelled snuffbox with Spanish snuff while his
left rested on a cane with a silver handle which had been worn quite
smooth with long use Alexyi Sergyitch had a shrill nasal voice and
was incessantly smiling amiably but somewhat patronisingly not
without a certain selfsatisfied pompousness He also laughed in an
amiable manner with a fine thin laugh like a string of wax pearls He
was courteous and affable in the ancient manner of Katherines day and
moved his hands slowly and with a circular motion also in ancient
style On account of his weak legs he could not walk but he was wont
to trip with hurried little steps from one armchair to another
armchair in which he suddenly seated himselfor rather he fell into
it as softly as though he had been a pillow

As I have already said Alexyi Sergyitch never went anywhere and
associated very little with the neighbours although he was fond of
societyfor he was loquacious He had plenty of society in his own
house it is true divers Nikanr Nikanritches Sevastyi
Sevastyitches Fedlitches and Mikhitches all povertystricken petty
nobles in threadbare kazk coats and short jackets frequently from his
own noble shoulders dwelt beneath his roof not to mention the poor
gentlewomen in cottonprint gowns with black kerchiefs on their
shoulders and worsted reticules in their tightlyclenched
fingersdivers Avdtiya Svishnas Pelagya Mirnovnas and plain
Feklskas and Arnkas who received asylum in the womens wing No less
than fifteen persons ever sat down to Alexyi Sergyitchs table  he
was so hospitableAmong all these parasites two individuals stood
forth with special prominence a dwarf named Janus or the Twofaced a
Daneor as some asserted of Jewish extractionand crazy Prince L
In contrast to the customs of that day the dwarf did not in the least
serve as a butt for the guests and was not a jester on the contrary
he maintained constant silence wore an irate and surly mien
contracted his brows in a frown and gnashed his teeth as soon as any
one addressed a question to him Alexyi Sergyitch also called him a
philosopher and even respected him At table he was always the first to
be served after the guests and the master and mistress of the
houseGod has wronged him Alexyi Sergyitch was wont to say that
was the Lords will but it is not my place to wrong him

Why is he a philosopher I asked one day Janus did not like me No
sooner would I approach him than he would begin to snarl and growl
hoarsely Stranger dont bother me

But God have mercy why isnt he a philosopher replied Alexyi
Sergyitch Just observe my little gentleman how finely he holds his
tongue

But why is he twofaced

Because my young sir he has one face outside there it is for you
ninny and judge it But the other the real one he hides And I am
the only one who knows that face and for that I love him Because t
is a good face Thou for example gazest and beholdest nothing  but
even without words I see when he is condemning me for anything for he
is strict And always with reason Which thing thou canst not
understand young sir but just believe me an old man

The true history of the twofaced Januswhence he had come how he had
got into Alexyi Sergyitchs houseno one knew On the other hand the
story of Prince L was well known to all As a young man of twenty he
had come from a wealthy and distinguished family to Petersburg to serve
in a regiment of the Guards the Empress Katherine noticed him at the
first Court reception and halting in front of him and pointing to him
with her fan she said in a loud voice addressing one of her
favourites Look Adm Vaslievitch see what a beauty A regular
doll The blood flew to the poor young fellows head On reaching home
he ordered his calash to be harnessed up and donning his ribbon of the
Order of Saint Anna he started out to drive all over the town as
though he had actually fallen into luckCrush every one who does not
get out of the way he shouted to his coachmanAll this was
immediately brought to the Empresss knowledge an order was issued that
he was to be adjudged insane and given in charge of his two brothers
and the latter without the least delay carried him off to the country
and chained him up in a stone bagAs they were desirous to make use of
his property they did not release the unfortunate man even when he
recovered his senses and came to himself but continued to keep him
incarcerated until he really did lose his mindBut their wickedness
profited them nothing Prince L outlived his brothers and after long
sufferings found himself under the guardianship of Alexyi Sergyitch
who was a connection of his He was a fat perfectly bald man with a
long thin nose and blue goggleeyes He had got entirely out of the way
of speakinghe merely mumbled something unintelligible but he sang the
ancient Russian ballads admirably having retained to extreme old age
his silvery freshness of voice and in his singing he enunciated every
word clearly and distinctly Something in the nature of fury came over
him at times and then he became terrifying He would stand in one
corner with his face to the wall and all perspiring and
crimsoncrimson all over his bald head to the nape of his neck
Emitting a malicious laugh and stamping his feet he would issue orders
that some one was to be castigatedprobably his brothersThrash
he yelled hoarsely choking and coughing with laughterscourge spare
not thrash thrash thrash the monsters my malefactors Thats right
Thats right Just before he died he greatly amazed and frightened
Alexyi Sergyitch He entered the latters room all pale and quiet and
inclining his body in obeisance to the girdle he first returned thanks
for the asylum and oversight and then requested that a priest might be
sent for for Death had come to himhe had beheld herand he must
pardon all men and whiten himself

How was it that thou didst see her muttered the astounded Alexyi
Sergyitch who now heard a coherent speech from him for the first
timeWhat is she like Has she a scythe

No replied Prince LShes a plain old woman in a loose gownonly
she has but one eye in her forehead and that eye has no lid

And on the following day Prince L actually expired after having
fulfilled all his religious obligations and taken leave of every one
intelligently and with emotion

Thats the way I shall die also Alexyi Sergyitch was wont to
remark And in fact something similar happened with himof which
later on

But now let us return to our former subject Alexyi Sergyitch did not
consort with the neighbours as I have already said and they did not
like him any too well calling him eccentric arrogant a mocker and
even a Martinist who did not recognise the authorities without
themselves understanding of course the meaning of the last word To a
certain extent the neighbours were right Alexyi Sergyitch had resided
for nearly seventy years in succession in his Sukhodl having almost no
dealings whatever with the superior authorities with the military
officials or the courts The court is for the bandit the military
officer for the soldier he was wont to say but I God be thanked am
neither a bandit nor a soldier Alexyi Sergyitch really was somewhat
eccentric but the soul within him was not of the petty sort I will
narrate a few things about him

I never found out authoritatively what were his political views if
indeed one can apply to him such a very newfangled expression but he
was in his way rather an aristocrat than a noblyborn master of serfs
More than once he complained because God had not given him a son and
heir for the honour of the race for the continuation of the family
On the wall of his study hung the genealogical tree of the Telygins
with very profuse branches and multitudinous circles in the shape of
apples enclosed in a gilt frame

We Telygins he said are a very ancient stock existing from
remote antiquity there have been a great many of us Telygins but we
have not run after foreigners we have not bowed our backs we have not
wearied ourselves by standing on the porches of the mighty we have not
nourished ourselves on the courts we have not earned wages we have not
pined for Moscow we have not intrigued in Peter we have sat
still each on his place his own master on his own land  thrifty
domesticated birds my dear sirAlthough I myself have served in the
Guards yet it was not for long I thank you

Alexyi Sergyitch preferred the olden daysThings were freer then
more seemly I assure you on my honour But ever since the year one
thousand and eight hundred why precisely from that year he did not
explain this warring and this soldiering have come into fashion my
dear fellow These military gentlemen have mounted upon their heads some
sort of plumes made of cocks tails and made themselves like cocks
they have drawn their necks up tightly very tightly  they speak in
hoarse tones their eyes are popping out of their headsand how can
they help being hoarse The other day some police corporal or other came
to see meI have come to you Your WellBorn quoth he A pretty
way he had chosen to surprise me  for I know myself that I am
wellborn I have a matter of business with you But I said to him
Respected sir first undo the hooks on thy collar Otherwise which God
forbid thou wilt sneeze Akh what will become of thee What will
become of theeThou wilt burst like a puffball And I shall be
responsible for it And how they drink those military
gentlemenohoho I generally give orders that they shall be served
with champagne from the Don because Don champagne and Pontacq are all
the same to them it slips down their throats so smoothly and so
fasthow are they to distinguish the difference And heres another
thing they have begun to suck that suckingbottle to smoke tobacco A
military man will stick that same suckingbottle under his moustache
between his lips and emit smoke through his nostrils his mouth and
even his earsand think himself a hero There are my horrid
sonsinlaw for example although one of them is a senator and the
other is some sort of a curator they suck at the suckingbottle
alsoand yet they regard themselves as clever men

Alexyi Sergyitch could not endure smoking tobacco nor dogs
especially small dogsCome if thou art a Frenchman then keep a
lapdog Thou runnest thou skippest hither and thither and it follows
thee with its tail in the air  but of what use is it to fellows like
meHe was very neat and exacting He never spoke of the Empress
Katherine otherwise than with enthusiasm and in a lofty somewhat
bookish style She was a demigod not a human beingOnly contemplate
yon smile my good sir he was wont to add pointing at the Lampi
portrait and admit that she was a demigod I in my lifetime have
been so happy as to have been vouchsafed the bliss of beholding yon
smile and to all eternity it will never be erased from my heartAnd
thereupon he would impart anecdotes from the life of Katherine such as
it has never been my lot to read or hear anywhere Here is one of them
Alexyi Sergyitch did not permit the slightest hint at the failings of
the great Empress Yes and in conclusion he cried is it possible
to judge her as one judges other peopleOne day as she was sitting in
her powdermantle at the time of her morning toilet she gave orders
that her hair should be combed out And what happened The
waitingwoman passes the comb through it and electric sparks fly from
it in a perfect showerThen she called to her the body physician
Rodgerson who was present on duty and says to him I know that people
condemn me for certain actions but dost thou see this electricity
Consequently with such a nature and constitution as mine thou mayest
thyself judge for thou art a physician that it is unjust to condemn
me but they should understand me

The following incident was ineffaceably retained in the memory of
Alexyi Sergyitch He was standing one day on the inner watch in the
palace and he was only sixteen years of age And lo the Empress passes
himhe presents arms And she cried Alexyi Sergyitch again with
rapture smiling at my youth and my zeal deigned to give me her hand
to kiss and patted me on the cheek and inquired who I was and whence
I came and from what family And then  here the old mans voice
generally broke  then she bade me give my mother her compliments
and thank her for rearing her children so well And whether I was in
heaven or on earth and how and whither she withdrewwhether she
soared up on high or passed into another roomI know not to this
day

I often tried to question Alexyi Sergyitch about those olden days
about the men who surrounded the Empress But he generally evaded the
subject Whats the use of talking about old timeshe said  one
only tortures himself One says to himselfThou wert a young man
then but now thy last teeth have vanished from thy mouth And theres
no denying itthe old times were good  well and God be with them
And as for those menI suppose thou fidgety child that thou art
talking about the accidental men Thou hast seen a bubble spring forth
on water So long as it is whole and lasts what beautiful colours play
upon it Red and yellow and blue all one can say is Tis a rainbow
or a diamondBut it soon bursts and no trace of it remains And
thats what those men were like

Well and how about Potymkin I asked one day

Alexyi Sergyitch assumed a pompous mien Potymkin Grigry
Alexndritch was a statesman a theologian a nursling of Katherines
her offspring one must say But enough of that my little sir

Alexyi Sergyitch was a very devout man and went to church regularly
although it was beyond his strength There was no superstition
perceptible in him he ridiculed signs the evil eye and other
twaddle yet he did not like it when a hare ran across his path and
it was not quite agreeable for him to meet a priest He was very
respectful to ecclesiastical persons nevertheless and asked their
blessing and even kissed their hand every time but he talked with them
reluctantlyThey emit a very strong odour he explained but I
sinful man that I am have grown effeminate beyond measuretheir hair
is so long and oily and they comb it out in all directions
thinking thereby to show me respect and they clear their throats loudly
in the middle of conversation either out of timidity or because they
wish to please me in that way also Well but they remind me of my hour
of death But be that as it may I want to live a while longer Only
little sir dont repeat these remarks of mine respect the
ecclesiastical professiononly fools do not respect it and I am to
blame for talking nonsense in my old age

Alexyi Sergyitch had received a scanty education like all nobles
of that epoch but he had completed it to a certain degree by reading
He read only Russian books of the end of the last century he considered
the newer writers unleavened and weak in style During his reading he
placed beside him on a round onelegged little table a silver jug
filled with a special effervescent kvas flavoured with mint whose
pleasant odour disseminated itself through all the rooms He placed
large round spectacles on the tip of his nose but in his later years
he did not so much read as stare thoughtfully over the rims of the
spectacles elevating his brows mowing with his lips and sighing Once
I caught him weeping with a book on his knees which greatly surprised
me I admit

He recalled the following wretched doggerel

    O allconquering race of man
    Rest is unknown to thee
    Thou findest it only
    When thou swallowest the dust of the grave
    Bitter bitter is this rest
    Sleep ye dead But weep ye living

These verses were composed by a certain GrmitchGormtzky a roving
poetaster whom Alexyi Sergyitch had harboured in his house because he
seemed to him a delicate and even subtle man he wore shoes with knots
of ribbon pronounced his os broadly and raising his eyes to
heaven he sighed frequently In addition to all these merits
GrmitchGormtzky spoke French passably well for he had been educated
in a Jesuit college while Alexyi Sergyitch only understood it But
having once drunk himself deaddrunk in a dramshop this same subtle
Gormtzky displayed outrageous violence He thrashed to flinders
Alexyi Sergyitchs valet the cook two laundresses who happened
along and even an independent carpenter and smashed several panes in
the windows yelling lustily the while Here now Ill just show these
Russian sluggards these unlicked katzpyAnd what strength that
puny little man displayed Eight men could hardly control him For this
turbulence Alexyi Sergyitch gave orders that the rhymster should be
flung out of the house after he had preliminarily been rolled in the
snow it happened in the winter to sober him

Yes Alexyi Sergyitch was wont to say my day is over the horse is
worn out I used to keep poets at my expense and I used to buy pictures
and books from the Jewsand my geese were quite as good as those of
Mukhn and I had genuine slatecoloured tumblerpigeons I was an
amateur of all sorts of things Except that I never was a dogfancier
because of the drunkenness and the clownishness I was mettlesome
untamable God forbid that a Telygin should be anything but firstclass
in everything And I had a splendid horsebreeding establishment And
those horses came  whence thinkest thou my little sirFrom those
very renowned studs of the Tzar Ivn Alexyitch the brother of Peter
the Great Im telling you the truth All stallions dark brown in
colour with manes to their knees tails to their hoofs Lions
Vanity of vanities all is vanity But whats the use of regretting it
Every man has his limit fixed for himYou cannot fly higher than
heaven nor live in the water nor escape from the earth Let us live
on a while longer at any rate

And again the old man smiled and took a pinch of his Spanish tobacco

His peasants loved him Their master was kind according to them and
not a heartbreakerOnly they also repeated that he was a wornout
steed Formerly Alexyi Sergyitch had gone into everything himself he
had ridden out into the fields and to the flourmill and to the
oilmill and the storehouses and looked in to the peasants cottages
every one was familiar with his racingdrozhky upholstered in
crimson plush and drawn by a wellgrown horse with a broad blaze
extending clear across its forehead named Lanternfrom that same
famous breeding establishment Alexyi Sergyitch drove him himself with
the ends of the reins wound round his fists But when his seventieth
birthday came the old man gave up everything and entrusted the
management of his estate to the peasant bailiff Antp of whom he
secretly stood in awe and called Micromegas memories of Voltaire or
simply robber

Well robber hast thou gathered a big lot of stolen goods he would
say looking the robber straight in the eye

Everything is according to your grace Antp would reply merrily

Grace is all right only just look out for thyself Micromegas Dont
dare to touch my peasants my subjects behind my back They will make
complaint  my cane is not far off seest thou

I always keep your little cane well in mind dear little father Alexyi
Sergyitch replied AntpMicromegas stroking his beard

Thats right keep it in mind and master and bailiff laughed in each
others faces

With his houseserfs with his serfs in general with his subjects
Alexyi Sergyitch loved that word he dealt gentlyBecause judge
for thyself little nephew if thou hast nothing of thine own save the
cross on thy neck and that a brass one dont hanker after other
folks things What sense is there in that There is no denying the
fact that no one even thought of the socalled problem of the serfs at
that epoch and it could not disturb Alexyi Sergyitch He very calmly
ruled his subjects but he condemned bad landed proprietors and called
them the enemies of their class

He divided the nobles in general into three categories the judicious
of whom there are not many the profligate of whom there is a goodly
number and the licentious of whom there are enough to dam a pond
And if any one of them was harsh and oppressive to his subjects that
man was guilty in the sight of God and culpable in the sight of
menYes the houseserfs led an easy life in the old mans house the
subjects behind his back were less well off as a matter of course
despite the cane wherewith he threatened MicromegasAnd how many there
were of themof those houseserfsin his manor And for the most part
they were old sinewy hairy grumbling stoopshouldered clad in
longskirted nankeen kaftans and imbued with a strong acrid odour And
in the womens department nothing was to be heard but the trampling of
bare feet and the rustling of petticoatsThe head valet was named
Irinrkh and Alexyi Sergyitch always summoned him with a
longdrawnout call IrinaarkhHe called the others Young
fellow Boy What subject is thereHe could not endure bells God
have mercy this is no tavern And what amazed me was that no matter
at what time Alexyi Sergyitch called his valet the man instantly
presented himself just as though he had sprung out of the earth and
placing his heels together and putting his hands behind his back stood
before his master a grim and as it were an irate but zealous servant

Alexyi Sergyitch was lavish beyond his means but he did not like to
be called benefactorWhat sort of a benefactor am I to you sir
Im doing myself a favour not you my good sir When he was angry or
indignant he always called people youTo a beggar give once give
twice give thrice he was wont to say Well and if he returns for
the fourth timegive to him yet again only add therewith My good
man thou shouldst work with something else besides thy mouth all the
time

Uncle I used to ask him what if the beggar should return for the
fifth time after that

Why then do thou give to him for the fifth time

The sick people who appealed to him for aid he had cured at his own
expense although he himself did not believe in doctors and never sent
for themMy deceased mother he asserted used to heal all maladies
with oliveoil and salt she both administered it internally and rubbed
it on externally and everything passed off splendidly And who was my
mother She had her birth under Peter the Firstonly think of that

Alexyi Sergyitch was a Russian man in every respect he loved Russian
viands he loved Russian songs but the accordion a factory
invention he detested he loved to watch the maidens in their choral
songs the women in their dances In his youth it was said he had sung
rollickingly and danced with agility He loved to steam himself in the
bathand steamed himself so energetically that Irinrkh who served
him as bathattendant thrashed him with a birchbesom soaked in beer
rubbed him down with shredded linden bark then with a bit of
woollen cloth rolled a soap bladder over his masters shouldersthis
faithfullydevoted Irinrkh was accustomed to say every time as he
climbed down from the shelf as red as a new brass statue Well for
this time I the servant of God Irinrkh Tolobyeff am still whole
What will happen next time

And Alexyi Sergyitch spoke splendid Russian somewhat oldfashioned
but piquant and pure as spring water constantly interspersing his
speech with his pet words honour bright God have mercy at any
rate sir and little sir

Enough concerning him however Let us talk about Alexyi Sergyitchs
spouse Malnya Pvlovna

Malnya Pvlovna was a native of Moscow and had been accounted the
greatest beauty in town la Vnus de MoscouWhen I knew her she was
already a gaunt old woman with delicate but insignificant features
little curved harelike teeth in a tiny little mouth with a multitude
of tight little curls on her forehead and dyed eyebrows She constantly
wore a pyramidal cap with rosecoloured ribbons a high ruff around her
neck a short white gown and prunella shoes with red heels and over her
gown she wore a jacket of blue satin with the sleeve depending from
the right shoulder She had worn precisely such a toilet on St Peters
day  On that day being still a maiden she had gone with her
relatives to the Khodnskoe Field to see the famous prizefight
arranged by the Orlffs

And Count Alexyi Grigrievitch  oh how many times did I hear
that tale  having descried me approached made a low obeisance
holding his hat in both hands and spake thus My stunning beauty why
dost thou allow that sleeve to hang from thy shoulder Is it that thou
wishest to have a match at fisticuffs with me With pleasure only I
tell thee beforehand that thou hast vanquished meI surrenderand I
am thy captiveand every one stared at us and marvelled

And so she had worn that style of toilet ever since

Only I wore no cap then but a hat  la bergre de Trianon and
although I was powdered yet my hair gleamed through it like gold

Malnya Pvlovna was stupid to sanctity as the saying goes she
chattered at random and did not herself quite know what issued from her
mouthbut it was chiefly about OrlffOrlff had become one may say
the principal interest of her life She usually enteredno she
floated intothe room moving her head in a measured way like a
peacock came to a halt in the middle of it with one foot turned out in
a strange sort of way and holding the pendent sleeve in two fingers
that must have been the pose which had pleased Orlff once on a time
she looked about her with arrogant carelessness as befits a beauty
she even sniffed and whispered The idea exactly as though some
important cavalieradorer were besieging her with complimentsthen
suddenly walked on clattering her heels and shrugging her shoulders
She also took Spanish snuff out of a tiny bonbon box scooping it out
with a tiny golden spoon and from time to time especially when a new
person made his appearance she raisednot to her eyes but to her nose
her vision was excellenta double lorgnette in the shape of a pair of
horns showing off and twisting about her little white hand with one
finger standing out apart

How many times did Malnya Pvlovna describe to me her wedding in the
Church of the Ascension which is on the Arbt Squaresuch a fine
churchand all Moscow was present at it  there was such a crush T
was frightful There were equipages drawn by six horses golden
carriages runners  one of Count Zavadvskys runners even fell under
the wheels And the bishop himself married us and what an address
he delivered Everybody weptwherever I looked there was nothing but
tears tears  and the GovernorGenerals horses were
tigercoloured And how many many flowers people brought They
overwhelmed us with flowers And one foreigner a rich very rich man
shot himself for love on that occasion and Orlff was present also
And approaching Alexyi Sergyitch he congratulated him and called him a
lucky dog Thou art a lucky dog brother gaper he said And in
reply Alexyi Sergyitch made such a wonderful obeisance and swept the
plume of his hat along the floor from left to right  as much as to
say There is a line drawn now Your Radiance between you and my
spouse which you must not step acrossAnd Orlff Alexyi
Grigrievitch immediately understood and lauded himOh what a man he
was What a man And then on another occasion Alexis and I were at a
ball in his houseI was already marriedand what magnificent diamond
buttons he wore And I could not restrain myself but praised them
What splendid diamonds you have Count And thereupon he took a knife
from the table cut off one button and presented it to mesaying You
have in your eyes my dear little dove diamonds a hundredfold finer
just stand before the mirror and compare them And I did stand there
and he stood beside meWell Who is rightsays heand keeps
rolling his eyes all round me And then Alexyi Sergyitch was greatly
dismayed but I said to him Alexis I said to him please do not be
dismayed thou shouldst know me better And he answered me Be at
ease MlanieAnd those same diamonds I now have encircling a
medallion of Alexyi GrigrievitchI think my dear that thou hast
seen me wear it on my shoulder on festival days on a ribbon of St
Georgebecause he was a very brave hero a cavalier of the Order of St
George he burned the Turks

Notwithstanding all this Malnya Pvlovna was a very kind woman she
was easy to pleaseShe doesnt nag you and she doesnt sneer at
you the maids said of herMalnya Pvlovna was passionately fond of
all sweets and a special old woman who occupied herself with nothing
but the preserves and therefore was called the preservewoman brought
to her half a score of times in a day a Chinese plate now with
candied roseleaves again with barberries in honey or orange sherbet
Malnya Pvlovna feared solitudedreadful thoughts come thenand was
almost constantly surrounded by female hangerson whom she urgently
entreated Talk talk Why do you sit there and do nothing but warm
your seatsand they began to twitter like canarybirds Being no less
devout than Alexyi Sergyitch she was very fond of praying but as
according to her own words she had not learned to recite prayers well
she kept for that purpose the widow of a deacon who prayed so tastily
She would never stumble to all eternity And in fact that deacons
widow understood how to utter prayerful words in an irrepressible sort
of way without a break even when she inhaled or exhaled her breathand
Malnya Pvlovna listened and melted with emotion She had another widow
also attached to her service the latters duty consisted in telling her
stories at nightbut only old ones entreated Malnya Pvlovna
those I already know all the new ones are spurious

Malnya Pvlovna was very frivolous and sometimes suspicious All of a
sudden she would take some idea into her head She did not like the
dwarf Janus for example it always seemed to her as though he would
suddenly start in and begin to shriek But do you know who I am A
Buryt Prince So then submitAnd if she did not he would set fire
to the house out of melancholy Malnya Pvlovna was as lavish as
Alexyi Sergyitch but she never gave moneyshe did not wish to soil
her pretty little handsbut kerchiefs earrings gowns ribbons or
she would send a patty from the table or a bit of the roast or if not
that a glass of wine She was also fond of regaling the peasantwomen
on holidays They would begin to dance and she would click her heels
and strike an attitude

Alexyi Sergyitch was very well aware that his wife was stupid but he
had trained himself almost from the first year of his married life to
pretend that she was very keen of tongue and fond of saying stinging
things As soon as she got to chattering he would immediately shake his
little finger at her and say Okh what a naughty little tongue What a
naughty little tongue Wont it catch it in the next world It will be
pierced with redhot needlesBut Malnya Pvlovna did not take
offence at this on the contrary she seemed to feel flattered at
hearing such remarksas much as to say Well I cant help it It
isnt my fault that I was born witty

Malnya Pvlovna worshipped her husband and all her life remained an
exemplary and faithful wife But there had been an object in her life
also a young nephew a hussar who had been slain so she assumed in
a duel on her accountbut according to more trustworthy information
he had died from a blow received on the head from a billiardcue in
tavern company The watercolour portrait of this object was preserved
by her in a secret casket Malnya Pvlovna crimsoned to the very ears
every time she alluded to Kaptonushkathat was the objects
namewhile Alexyi Sergyitch scowled intentionally again menaced his
wife with his little finger and said Trust not a horse in the meadow
a wife in the house Okh that Kaptonushka KupidnushkaThen
Malnya Pvlovna bristled up all over and exclaimed

Alexis shame on you AlexisYou yourself probably flirted with
divers little ladies in your youthand so you take it for granted

Come that will do that will do Malniushka Alexyi Sergyitch
interrupted her with a smilethy gown is white and thy soul is
whiter still

It is whiter Alexis it is whiter

Okh what a naughty little tongue on my honour what a naughty little
tongue repeated Alexyi Sergyitch tapping her on the cheek

To mention Malnya Pvlovnas convictions would be still more out of
place than to mention those of Alexyi Sergyitch but I once chanced to
be the witness of a strange manifestation of my aunts hidden feelings
I once chanced in the course of conversation to mention the wellknown
Sheshkvsky Malnya Pvlovna suddenly became livid in the faceas
livid as a corpseturned green despite the layer of paint and powder
and in a dull entirelygenuine voice which very rarely happened with
heras a general thing she seemed always somewhat affected assumed an
artificial tone and lisped said Okh whom hast thou mentioned And at
nightfall into the bargainDont utter that name I was amazed what
significance could that name possess for such an inoffensive and
innocent being who would not have known how to devise much less to
execute anything reprehensibleThis alarm which revealed itself
after a lapse of nearly half a century induced in me reflections which
were not altogether cheerful

Alexyi Sergyitch died in his eightyeighth year in the year 
which evidently disturbed even him And his death was rather strange
That morning he had felt well although he no longer quitted his
armchair at all But suddenly he called to his wife Malniushka come
hither

What dost thou want Alexis

It is time for me to die thats what my darling

God be with you Alexyi Sergyitch Why so

This is why In the first place one must show moderation and more
than that I was looking at my legs a little while ago  they were
strange legsand that settles itI looked at my handsand those
were strange also I looked at my bellyand the belly belonged to some
one elseWhich signifies that I am devouring some other persons
life Send for the priest and in the meanwhile lay me on my bed
from which I shall not rise again

Malnya Pvlovna was in utter consternation but she put the old man to
bed and sent for the priest Alexyi Sergyitch made his confession
received the holy communion took leave of the members of his household
and began to sink into a stupor Malnya Pvlovna was sitting beside his
bed

Alexis she suddenly shrieked do not frighten me do not close thy
dear eyes Hast thou any pain

The old man looked at his wifeNo I have no pain  but I find
it  rather difficult  difficult to breathe Then after a brief
pauseMalniushka he said now life has galloped pastbut dost
thou remember our wedding  what a fine young couple we were

We were my beauty Alexis my incomparable one

Again the old man remained silent for a space

And shall we meet again in the other world Malniushka

I shall pray to God that we may AlexisAnd the old woman burst into
tears

Come dont cry silly one perchance the Lord God will make us young
again thereand we shall again be a fine young pair

He will make us young Alexis

Everything is possible to Him to the Lord remarked Alexyi
SergyitchHe is a worker of wondersI presume He will make thee a
clever woman also Come my dear I was jesting give me thy hand to
kiss

And I will kiss thine

And the two old people kissed each others hands

Alexyi Sergyitch began to quiet down and sink into a comatose state
Malnya Pvlovna gazed at him with emotion brushing the tears from her
eyelashes with the tip of her finger She sat thus for a couple of
hours

Has he fallen asleep asked in a whisper the old woman who knew how to
pray so tastily peering out from behind Irinrkh who was standing as
motionless as a pillar at the door and staring intently at his dying
master

Yes replied Malnya Pvlovna also in a whisper And suddenly Alexyi
Sergyitch opened his eyes

My faithful companion he stammered my respected spouse I would
like to bow myself to thy feet for all thy love and faithfulnessbut
how am I to rise Let me at least sign thee with the cross

Malnya Pvlovna drew nearer bent over But the hand which had been
raised fell back powerless on the coverlet and a few moments later
Alexyi Sergyitch ceased to be

His daughters with their husbands only arrived in time for the funeral
neither one of them had any children Alexyi Sergyitch had not
discriminated against them in his will although he had not referred to
them on his deathbed

My heart is locked against them he had said to me one day Knowing
his kindheartedness I was surprised at his wordsIt is a difficult
matter to judge between parents and childrenA vast ravine begins
with a tiny rift Alexyi Sergyitch had said to me on another
occasion referring to the same subject A wound an arshn long will
heal over but if you cut off so much as a nail it will not grow
again

I have an idea that the daughters were ashamed of their eccentric old
folks

A month later Malnya Pvlovna expired also She hardly rose from her
bed again after the day of Alexyi Sergyitchs death and did not
array herself but they buried her in the blue jacket and with the
medal of Orlff on her shoulder only minus the diamonds The daughters
shared those between them under the pretext that those diamonds were to
be used for the setting of holy pictures but as a matter of fact they
used them to adorn their own persons

And now how vividly do my old people stand before me and what a good
memory I cherish of them And yet during my very last visit to them I
was already a student at the time an incident occurred which injected
some discord into the harmoniouslypatriarchal mood with which the
Telygin house inspired me

Among the number of the household serfs was a certain Ivn nicknamed
Sukhkhthe coachman or the little coachman as he was called on
account of his small size in spite of his years which were not few He
was a tiny scrap of a man nimble snubnosed curlyhaired with a
perennial smile on his infantile countenance and little mouselike
eyes He was a great joker and buffoon he was able to acquire any
trick he set off fireworks snakes played all cardgames galloped his
horse while standing erect on it flew higher than any one else in the
swing and even knew how to present Chinese shadows There was no one
who could amuse children better than he and he would have been only
too glad to occupy himself with them all day long When he got to
laughing he set the whole house astir People would answer him from this
point and thatevery one would join in They would both abuse him
and laughIvn danced marvellouslyespecially the fishThe chorus
would thunder out a dance tune the young fellow would step into the
middle of the circle and begin to leap and twist about and stamp his
feet and then come down with a crash on the groundand there represent
the movements of a fish which has been thrown out of the water upon the
dry land and he would writhe about this way and that and even bring
his heels up to his neck and then when he sprang to his feet and began
to shout the earth would simply tremble beneath him Alexyi Sergyitch
was extremely fond of choral songs and dances as I have already said
he could never refrain from shouting Send hither Vniushka the little
coachman Give us the fish be livelyand a minute later he would
whisper in ecstasy Akh what a devil of a man he is

Well thenon my last visit this same Ivn Sukhkh comes to me in my
room and without uttering a word plumps down on his knees

What is the matter with thee Ivn

Save me master

Why whats the trouble

And thereupon Ivn related to me his grief

He had been swapped twenty years previously by the Messrs Sukhy for
another serf a man belonging to the Telyginshe had simply been
exchanged without any formalities and documents The man who had been
given in exchange for him had died but the Messrs Sukhy had forgotten
all about Ivn and had left him in Alexyi Sergyitchs house as his
property his nickname alone served as a reminder of his
originBut lo and behold his former owners had died also their
estate had fallen into other hands and the new owner concerning whom
rumours were in circulation to the effect that he was a cruel man a
torturer having learned that one of his serfs was to be found at
Alexyi Sergyitchs without any passport and right began to demand his
return in case of refusal he threatened to have recourse to the courts
and a penaltyand he did not threaten idly as he himself held the rank
of Privy Councillor and had great weight in the government
Ivn in his affright darted to Alexyi Sergyitch The old man was
sorry for his dancer and he offered to buy Ivn from the privy
councillor at a good price but the privy councillor would not hear of
such a thing he was a Little Russian and obstinate as the devil The
poor fellow had to be surrendered

I have got used to living here I have made myself at home here I have
eaten bread here and here I wish to die Ivan said to meand there
was no grin on his face now on the contrary he seemed turned into
stone But now I must go to that malefactor Am I a dog that I am
to be driven from one kennel to another with a slipnoose round my
neckand a take that Save me master entreat your uncleremember
how I have always amused you Or something bad will surely come of
it the matter will not pass off without sin

Without what sin Ivn

Why I will kill that gentlemanWhen I arrive I shall say to him
Let me go back master otherwise look out beware I will kill
you

If a chaffinch or a bullfinch could talk and had begun to assure me that
it would claw another bird it would not have caused me greater
astonishment than did Ivn on that occasionWhat Vnya Sukhkh that
dancer jester buffoon that favourite of the children and a child
himselfthat kindesthearted of beingsa murderer What nonsense I
did not believe him for a single moment I was startled in the extreme
that he should have been able to utter such a word Nevertheless I
betook myself to Alexyi Sergyitch I did not repeat to him what Ivn
had said to me but I tried in every way to beg him to see whether he
could not set the matter right

My little sir the old man replied to me I would be only too
delighted but how can II have offered that Topknot huge
remuneration I offered him three hundred rubles I assure thee on my
honour but in vain What is one to do We had acted illegally on
faith after the ancient fashion  and now see what a bad thing has
come of it I am sure that Topknot will take Ivn from me by force the
first thing we know he has a strong hand the Governor eats sour
cabbagesoup with himthe Topknot will send a soldier Im afraid of
those soldiers In former days theres no denying it I would have
defended Ivnbut just look at me now how decrepit I have grown How
am I to wage warAnd in fact during my last visit I found that
Alexyi Sergyitch had aged very greatly even the pupils of his eyes
had acquired a milky huelike that in infantsand on his lips there
appeared not the discerning smile of former days but that
strainedlysweet unconscious smirk which never leaves the faces of very
old people even in their sleep

I imparted Alexyi Sergyitchs decision to Ivn He stood a while held
his peace and shook his headWell he said at last what is fated
to be cannot be avoided Only my word is firm That is to say only one
thing remains for me  play the wag to the endMaster please give
me something for liquor I gave it he drank himself drunkand on that
same day he danced the fish in such wise that the maidens and married
women fairly squealed with delight so whimsically amusing was he

The next day I went home and three months laterwhen I was already in
PetersburgI learned that Ivn had actually kept his wordHe had been
sent to his new master his master had summoned him to his study and
announced to him that he was to serve as his coachman that he entrusted
him with a trika of Vytka horses and that he should exact a
strict account from him if he treated them badly and in general if he
were not punctualIm not fond of jesting he saidIvn listened
to his master first made obeisance to his very feet and then informed
him that it was as his mercy liked but he could not be his
servantRelease me on quitrent Your HighBorn he said or make a
soldier of me otherwise there will be a catastrophe before long

The master flared upAkh damn thee What is this thou darest to say
to meKnow in the first place that I am Your Excellency and not
Your HighBorn in the second place thou art beyond the age and thy
size is not such that I can hand thee over as a soldier and in
conclusionwhat calamity art thou threatening me with Art thou
preparing to commit arson

No your Excellency not to commit arson

To kill me then pray

Ivn maintained a stubborn silenceI will not be your servant he
said at last

Here then Ill show thee roared the gentleman whether thou wilt
be my servant or notAnd after having cruelly flogged Ivn he
nevertheless ordered that the trika of Vytka horses should be placed
in his charge and appointed him a coachman at the stables

Ivn submitted to all appearances he began to drive as coachman As he
was a proficient in that line his master speedily took a fancy to
himthe more so as Ivn behaved very discreetly and quietly and the
horses throve under his care he tended them so that they became as
plump as cucumbersone could never leave off admiring them The master
began to drive out more frequently with him than with the other
coachmen He used to ask Dost thou remember Ivn how unpleasant was
thy first meeting with me I think thou hast got rid of thy folly But
to these words Ivn never made any reply

So then one day just before the Epiphany the master set out for the
town with Ivn in his trika with bells in a broad sledge lined with
rugs The horses began to ascend a hill at a walk while Ivn descended
from the box and went back to the sledge as though he had dropped
somethingThe cold was very severe The master sat there all wrapped
up and with his beaver cap drawn down over his ears Then Ivn pulled a
hatchet out from under the skirts of his coat approached his master
from behind knocked off his cap and saying I warned thee Pitr
Petrvitchnow thou hast thyself to thank for thishe laid open his
head with one slash Then he brought the horses to a standstill put the
cap back on his murdered masters head and again mounting the box he
drove him to the town straight to the courthouse

Heres the general from Sukhy for you murdered and I killed himI
told him I would do it and I have done it Bind me

They seized Ivn tried him condemned him to the knout and then to
penal servitudeThe merry birdlike dancer reached the minesand
there vanished forever

Yes involuntarilyalthough in a different senseone repeats with
Alexyi SergyitchThe old times were good  well yes but God be
with them I want nothing to do with them






THE SONG OF LOVE TRIUMPHANT




                 MDXLII

DEDICATED TO THE MEMORY OF GUSTAVE FLAUBERT

    Wage du zu irren und zu trumen
                                 SCHILLER


The following is what I read in an Italian manuscript




I


About the middle of the sixteenth century there dwelt in Ferrarait
was then flourishing under the sceptre of its magnificent dukes the
patrons of the arts and of poetrythere dwelt two young men named
Fabio and Muzio Of the same age and nearly related they were almost
never separated a sincere friendship had united them since their early
childhood and a similarity of fate had strengthened this bond Both
belonged to ancient families both were wealthy independent and
without family the tastes and inclinations of both were similar Muzio
occupied himself with music Fabio with painting All Ferrara was proud
of them as the finest ornaments of the Court of society and of the
city But in personal appearance they did not resemble each other
although both were distinguished for their stately youthful beauty
Fabio was the taller of the two white of complexion with ruddygold
hair and had blue eyes Muzio on the contrary had a swarthy face
black hair and in his darkbrown eyes there was not that merry gleam
on his lips not that cordial smile which Fabio had his thick eyebrows
overhung his narrow eyelids while Fabios golden brows rose in slender
arches on his pure smooth forehead Muzio was less animated in
conversation also nevertheless both friends were equally favoured by
the ladies for not in vain were they models of knightly courtesy and
lavishness

At one and the same time with them there dwelt in Ferrara a maiden named
Valeria She was considered one of the greatest beauties in the city
although she was to be seen only very rarely as she led a retired life
and left her house only to go to churchand on great festivals for a
walk She lived with her mother a noblyborn but not wealthy widow who
had no other children Valeria inspired in every one whom she met a
feeling of involuntary amazement and of equally involuntary tender
respect so modest was her mien so little aware was she to all
appearance of the full force of her charms Some persons it is true
thought her rather pale the glance of her eyes which were almost
always lowered expressed a certain shyness and even timidity her lips
smiled rarely and then but slightly hardly ever did any one hear her
voice But a rumour was in circulation to the effect that it was very
beautiful and that locking herself in her chamber early in the
morning while everything in the city was still sleeping she loved to
warble ancient ballads to the strains of a lute upon which she herself
played Despite the pallor of her face Valeria was in blooming health
and even the old people as they looked on her could not refrain from
thinkingOh how happy will be that young man for whom this bud still
folded in its petals still untouched and virgin shall at last unfold
itself




II


Fabio and Muzio beheld Valeria for the first time at a sumptuous popular
festival got up at the command of the Duke of Ferrara Ercole son of
the famous Lucrezia Borgia in honour of some distinguished grandees who
had arrived from Paris on the invitation of the Duchess the daughter of
Louis XII King of France Side by side with her mother sat Valeria in
the centre of an elegant tribune erected after drawings by Palladius
on the principal square of Ferrara for the most honourable ladies of the
city Both Fabio and Muzio fell passionately in love with her that day
and as they concealed nothing from each other each speedily learned
what was going on in his comrades heart They agreed between themselves
that they would both try to make close acquaintance with Valeria and if
she should deign to choose either one of them the other should submit
without a murmur to her decision

Several weeks later thanks to the fine reputation which they rightfully
enjoyed they succeeded in penetrating into the not easily accessible
house of the widow she gave them permission to visit her From that
time forth they were able to see Valeria almost every day and to
converse with herand with every day the flame kindled in the hearts
of both young men blazed more and more vigorously But Valeria displayed
no preference for either of them although their presence evidently
pleased her With Muzio she occupied herself with music but she chatted
more with Fabio she was less shy with him At last they decided to
learn their fate definitely and sent to Valeria a letter wherein they
asked her to explain herself and say on whom she was prepared to bestow
her hand Valeria showed this letter to her mother and informed her
that she was content to remain unmarried but if her mother thought it
was time for her to marry she would wed the man of her mothers
choice The honourable widow shed a few tears at the thought of parting
from her beloved child but there was no reason for rejecting the
suitors she considered them both equally worthy of her daughters hand
But as she secretly preferred Fabio and suspected that he was more to
Valerias taste also she fixed upon him On the following day Fabio
learned of his happiness and all that was left to Muzio was to keep his
word and submit

This he did but he was not able to be a witness to the triumph of his
friend his rival He immediately sold the greater part of his property
and collecting a few thousand ducats he set off on a long journey to
the Orient On taking leave of Fabio he said to him that he would not
return until he should feel that the last traces of passion in him had
vanished It was painful for Fabio to part from the friend of his
childhood and his youth  but the joyful anticipation of approaching
bliss speedily swallowed up all other sentimentsand he surrendered
himself completely to the transports of happy love

He soon married Valeria and only then did he learn the full value of
the treasure which it had fallen to his lot to possess He had a very
beautiful villa at a short distance from Ferrara he removed thither
with his wife and her mother A bright time then began for them Wedded
life displayed in a new and captivating light all Valerias perfections
Fabio became a remarkable artistno longer a mere amateur but a
master Valerias mother rejoiced and returned thanks to God as she
gazed at the happy pair Four years flew by unnoticed like a blissful
dream One thing alone was lacking to the young married couple one
thing caused them grief they had no children  but hope had not
deserted them Toward the end of the fourth year a great and this time
a genuine grief visited them Valerias mother died after an illness
of a few days

Valeria shed many tears for a long time she could not reconcile herself
to her loss But another year passed life once more asserted its rights
and flowed on in its former channel And lo one fine summer evening
without having forewarned any one Muzio returned to Ferrara




III


During the whole five years which had elapsed since his departure no
one had known anything about him All rumours concerning him had died
out exactly as though he had vanished from the face of the earth When
Fabio met his friend on one of the streets in Ferrara he came near
crying out aloud first from fright then from joy and immediately
invited him to his villa There in the garden was a spacious detached
pavilion he suggested that his friend should settle down in that
pavilion Muzio gladly accepted and that same day removed thither with
his servant a dumb Malaydumb but not deaf and even judging from the
vivacity of his glance a very intelligent man His tongue had been
cut out Muzio had brought with him scores of chests filled with divers
precious things which he had collected during his prolonged wanderings

Valeria was delighted at Muzios return and he greeted her in a
cheerfullyfriendly but composed manner From everything it was obvious
that he had kept the promise made to Fabio In the course of the day he
succeeded in installing himself in his pavilion with the aid of his
Malay he set out the rarities he had broughtrugs silken tissues
garments of velvet and brocade weapons cups dishes and beakers
adorned with enamel articles of gold and silver set with pearls and
turquoises carved caskets of amber and ivory faceted flasks spices
perfumes pelts of wild beasts the feathers of unknown birds and a
multitude of other objects the very use of which seemed mysterious and
incomprehensible Among the number of all these precious things there
was one rich pearl necklace which Muzio had received from the Shah of
Persia for a certain great and mysterious service he asked Valerias
permission to place this necklace on her neck with his own hand it
seemed to her heavy and as though endowed with a strange sort of warmth
 it fairly adhered to the skin Toward evening after dinner as they
sat on the terrace of the villa in the shade of oleanders and laurels
Muzio began to narrate his adventures He told of the distant lands
which he had seen of mountains higher than the clouds of rivers like
unto seas he told of vast buildings and temples of trees thousands of
years old of rainbowhued flowers and birds he enumerated the cities
and peoples he had visited their very names exhaled something
magical All the Orient was familiar to Muzio he had traversed Persia
and Arabia where the horses are more noble and beautiful than all other
living creatures he had penetrated the depths of India where is a race
of people resembling magnificent plants he had attained to the confines
of China and Tibet where a living god the Dalai Lama by name dwells
upon earth in the form of a speechless man with narrow eyes Marvellous
were his tales Fabio and Valeria listened to him as though enchanted

In point of fact Muzios features had undergone but little change
swarthy from childhood his face had grown still darkerhad been
burned beneath the rays of a more brilliant sunhis eyes seemed more
deeply set than of yore that was all but the expression of that face
had become different concentrated grave it did not grow animated even
when he alluded to the dangers to which he had been subjected by night
in the forests deafened by the roar of tigers by day on deserted roads
where fanatics lie in wait for travellers and strangle them in honour of
an iron goddess who demands human blood And Muzios voice had grown
more quiet and even the movements of his hands of his whole body had
lost the flourishing ease which is peculiar to the Italian race

With the aid of his servant the obsequiouslyalert Malay he showed his
host and hostess several tricks which he had been taught by the Brahmins
of India Thus for example having preliminarily concealed himself
behind a curtain he suddenly appeared sitting in the air with his legs
doubled up beneath him resting the tips of his fingers lightly on a
bamboo rod set upright which not a little amazed and even alarmed Fabio
and Valeria Can it be that he is a magician the thought occurred
to herBut when he set to calling out tame snakes from a covered
basket by whistling on a small flutewhen wiggling their fangs their
dark flat heads made their appearance from beneath the motley stuff
Valeria became frightened and begged Muzio to hide away those horrors as
quickly as possible

At supper Muzio regaled his friends with wine of Shiraz from a round
flask with a long neck extremely fragrant and thick of a golden hue
with greenish lights it sparkled mysteriously when poured into the tiny
jasper cups In taste it did not resemble European wines it was very
sweet and spicy and quaffed slowly in small sips it produced in all
the limbs a sensation of agreeable drowsiness Muzio made Fabio and
Valeria drink a cup apiece and drank one himself Bending over her cup
he whispered something and shook his fingers Valeria noticed this but
as there was something strange and unprecedented in all Muzios ways in
general and in all his habits she merely thought I wonder if he has
not accepted in India some new faith or whether they have such customs
thereThen after a brief pause she asked him Had he continued to
occupy himself with music during the time of his journeysIn reply
Muzio ordered the Malay to bring him his Indian violin It resembled
those of the present day only instead of four strings it had three a
bluish snakeskin was stretched across its top and the slender bow of
reed was semicircular in form and on its very tip glittered a pointed
diamond

Muzio first played several melancholy airswhich were according to
his assertion popular balladsstrange and even savage to the Italian
ear the sound of the metallic strings was plaintive and feeble But
when Muzio began the last song that same sound suddenly strengthened
quivered powerfully and resonantly the passionate melody poured forth
from beneath the broadlyhandled bowpoured forth with beautiful
undulations like the snake which had covered the top of the violin with
its skin and with so much fire with so much triumphant joy did this
song beam and blaze that both Fabio and Valeria felt a tremor at their
heart and the tears started to their eyes  while Muzio with his
head bent down and pressed against his violin with pallid cheeks and
brows contracted into one line seemed still more concentrated and
serious than ever and the diamond at the tip of the bow scattered
raylike sparks in its flight as though it also were kindled with the
fire of that wondrous song And when Muzio had finished and still
holding the violin tightly pressed between his chin and his shoulder
dropped his hand which held the bowWhat is that What hast thou been
playing to us Fabio exclaimedValeria uttered not a word but her
whole being seemed to repeat her husbands question Muzio laid the
violin on the table and lightly shaking back his hair said with a
courteous smile That That melody  that song I heard once on the
island of Ceylon That song is known there among the people as the
song of happy satisfied love

Repeat it whispered Fabio

No it is impossible to repeat it replied Muzio And it is late now
Signora Valeria ought to rest and it is high time for me also I am
weary

All day long Muzio had treated Valeria in a respectfullysimple manner
like a friend of long standing but as he took leave he pressed her hand
very hard jamming his fingers into her palm staring so intently into
her face the while that she although she did not raise her eyelids
felt conscious of that glance on her suddenlyflushing cheeks She said
nothing to Muzio but drew away her hand and when he was gone she
stared at the door through which he had made his exit She recalled how
in former years also she had been afraid of him  and now she was
perplexed Muzio went off to his pavilion the husband and wife withdrew
to their bedchamber




IV


Valeria did not soon fall asleep her blood was surging softly and
languidly and there was a faint ringing in her head  from that
strange wine as she supposed and possibly also from Muzios tales
from his violin playing Toward morning she fell asleep at last and
had a remarkable dream

It seems to her that she enters a spacious room with a low vaulted
ceiling She has never seen such a room in her life All the walls
are set with small blue tiles bearing golden patterns slender carved
pillars of alabaster support the marble vault this vault and the
pillars seem semitransparent A pale rosecoloured light penetrates
the room from all directions illuminating all the objects mysteriously
and monotonously cushions of gold brocade lie on a narrow rug in the
very middle of the floor which is as smooth as a mirror In the
corners barely visible two tall incenseburners representing
monstrous animals are smoking there are no windows anywhere the door
screened by a velvet drapery looms silently black in a niche of the
wall And suddenly this curtain softly slips aside moves away  and
Muzio enters He bows opens his arms smiles His harsh arms
encircle Valerias waist his dry lips have set her to burning all
over She falls prone on the cushions

                                   

Moaning with fright Valeria awoke after long effortsStill not
comprehending where she is and what is the matter with her she half
raises herself up in bed and looks about her A shudder runs through
her whole body Fabio is lying beside her He is asleep but his
face in the light of the round clear moon is as pale as that of a
corpse  it is more melancholy than the face of a corpse Valeria
awoke her husbandand no sooner had he cast a glance at her than he
exclaimed What is the matter with thee

I have seen  I have seen a dreadful dream she whispered still
trembling

But at that moment from the direction of the pavilion strong sounds
were wafted to themand both Fabio and Valeria recognised the melody
which Muzio had played to them calling it the Song of Love
TriumphantFabio cast a glance of surprise at Valeria She closed
her eyes and turned awayand both holding their breath listened to
the song to the end When the last sound died away the moon went behind
a cloud it suddenly grew dark in the room The husband and wife
dropped their heads on their pillows without exchanging a word and
neither of them noticed when the other fell asleep




V


On the following morning Muzio came to breakfast he seemed pleased
and greeted Valeria merrily She answered him with confusion
scrutinised him closely and was startled by that pleased merry
face those piercing and curious eyes Muzio was about to begin his
stories again  but Fabio stopped him at the first word

Evidently thou wert not able to sleep in a new place My wife and I
heard thee playing the song of last night

Yes Did you hear itsaid MuzioI did play it in fact but I had
been asleep before that and I had even had a remarkable dream

Valeria pricked up her earsWhat sort of a dream inquired Fabio

I seemed replied Muzio without taking his eyes from Valeria to see
myself enter a spacious apartment with a vaulted ceiling decorated in
Oriental style Carved pillars supported the vault the walls were
covered with tiles and although there were no windows nor candles yet
the whole room was filled with a rosy light just as though it had all
been built of transparent stone In the corners Chinese incenseburners
were smoking on the floor lay cushions of brocade along a narrow rug
I entered through a door hung with a curtain and from another door
directly opposite a woman whom I had once loved made her appearance And
she seemed to me so beautiful that I became all aflame with my love of
days gone by

Muzio broke off significantly Valeria sat motionless only paling
slowly  and her breathing grew more profound

Then pursued Muzio I woke up and played that song

But who was the woman said Fabio

Who was she The wife of an East Indian I met her in the city of
Delhi She is no longer among the living She is dead

And her husband asked Fabio without himself knowing why he did so

Her husband is dead also they say I soon lost sight of them

Strange remarked FabioMy wife also had a remarkable dream last
nightwhich she did not relate to me added Fabio

But at this point Valeria rose and left the room Immediately after
breakfast Muzio also went away asserting that he was obliged to go to
Ferrara on business and that he should not return before evening




VI


Several weeks before Muzios return Fabio had begun a portrait of his
wife depicting her with the attributes of Saint CeciliaHe had made
noteworthy progress in his art the famous Luini the pupil of Leonardo
da Vinci had come to him in Ferrara and aiding him with his own
advice had also imparted to him the precepts of his great master The
portrait was almost finished it only remained for him to complete the
face by a few strokes of the brush and then Fabio might feel justly
proud of his work

When Muzio departed to Ferrara Fabio betook himself to his studio
where Valeria was generally awaiting him but he did not find her there
he called to hershe did not respond A secret uneasiness took
possession of Fabio he set out in quest of her She was not in the
house Fabio ran into the gardenand there in one of the most remote
alleys he descried Valeria With head bowed upon her breast and hands
clasped on her knees she was sitting on a bench and behind her
standing out against the dark green of a cypress a marble satyr with
face distorted in a malicious smile was applying his pointed lips to
his reedpipes Valeria was visibly delighted at her husbands
appearance and in reply to his anxious queries she said that she had a
slight headache but that it was of no consequence and that she was
ready for the sitting Fabio conducted her to his studio posed her and
took up his brush but to his great vexation he could not possibly
finish the face as he would have liked And that not because it was
somewhat pale and seemed fatigued  no but he did not find in it
that day the pure holy expression which he so greatly loved in it and
which had suggested to him the idea of representing Valeria in the form
of Saint Cecilia At last he flung aside his brush told his wife that
he was not in the mood that ft would do her good to lie down for a
while as she was not feeling quite well to judge by her looksand
turned his easel so that the portrait faced the wall Valeria agreed
with him that she ought to rest and repeating her complaint of
headache she retired to her chamber

Fabio remained in the studio He felt a strange agitation which was
incomprehensible even to himself Muzios sojourn under his roof a
sojourn which he Fabio had himself invited embarrassed him And it
was not that he was jealous  was it possible to be jealous of
Valeriabut in his friend he did not recognise his former comrade All
that foreign strange new element which Muzio had brought with him from
those distant landsand which apparently had entered into his very
flesh and bloodall those magical processes songs strange
beverages that dumb Malay even the spicy odour which emanated from
Muzios garments from his hair his breathall this inspired in Fabio
a feeling akin to distrust nay even to timidity And why did that
Malay when serving at table gaze upon him Fabio with such
disagreeable intentness Really one might suppose that he understood
Italian Muzio had said concerning him that that Malay in paying the
penalty with his tongue had made a great sacrifice and in compensation
now possessed great powerWhat power And how could he have acquired
it at the cost of his tongue All this was very strange Very
incomprehensible

Fabio went to his wife in her chamber she was lying on the bed fully
dressed but was not asleepOn hearing his footsteps she started then
rejoiced again to see him as she had done in the garden Fabio sat down
by the bed took Valerias hand and after a brief pause he asked her
What was that remarkable dream which had frightened her during the past
night And had it been in the nature of that dream which Muzio had
related

Valeria blushed and said hastilyOh no no I saw  some sort of a
monster which tried to rend me

A monster In the form of a man inquired Fabio

No a wild beast  a wild beastAnd Valeria turned away and hid
her flaming face in the pillows Fabio held his wifes hand for a while
longer silently he raised it to his lips and withdrew

The husband and wife passed a dreary day It seemed as though something
dark were hanging over their heads  but what it was they could not
tell They wanted to be together as though some danger were menacing
thembut what to say to each other they did not know Fabio made an
effort to work at the portrait to read Ariosto whose poem which had
recently made its appearance in Ferrara was already famous throughout
Italy but he could do nothing Late in the evening just in time for
supper Muzio returned




VII


He appeared calm and contentedbut related few stories he chiefly
interrogated Fabio concerning their mutual acquaintances of former days
the German campaign the Emperor Charles he spoke of his desire to go
to Rome to have a look at the new Pope Again he offered Valeria wine
of Shirazand in reply to her refusal he said as though to himself
It is not necessary now

On returning with his wife to their bedroom Fabio speedily fell
asleep  and waking an hour later was able to convince himself that no
one shared his couch Valeria was not with him He hastily rose and at
the selfsame moment he beheld his wife in her nightdress enter the
room from the garden The moon was shining brightly although not long
before a light shower had passed overWith widelyopened eyes and an
expression of secret terror on her impassive face Valeria approached
the bed and fumbling for it with her hands which were outstretched in
front of her she lay down hurriedly and in silence Fabio asked her a
question but she made no reply she seemed to be asleep He touched
her and felt raindrops on her clothing on her hair and grains of
sand on the soles of her bare feet Then he sprang up and rushed into
the garden through the halfopen door The moonlight brilliant to
harshness inundated all objects Fabio looked about him and descried on
the sand of the path traces of two pairs of feet one pair was bare and
those tracks led to an arbour covered with jasmin which stood apart
between the pavilion and the house He stopped short in perplexity and
lo suddenly the notes of that song which he had heard on the preceding
night again rang forth Fabio shuddered and rushed into the
pavilion Muzio was standing in the middle of the room playing on
his violin Fabio darted to him

Thou hast been in the garden thou hast been out thy clothing is damp
with rain

No I do not know  I do not think  that I have been out of
doors  replied Muzio in broken accents as though astonished at
Fabios advent and at his agitation

Fabio grasped him by the armAnd why art thou playing that melody
again Hast thou had another dream

Muzio glanced at Fabio with the same surprise as before and made no
answer

Come answer me

    The moon is steel like a circular shield
    The river gleams like a snake
    The friend is awake the enemy sleeps
    The hawk seizes the chicken in his claws
    Help

mumbled Muzio in a singsong as though in a state of unconsciousness

Fabio retreated a couple of paces fixed his eyes on Muzio meditated
for a space  and returned to his house to the bedchamber

With her head inclined upon her shoulder and her arms helplessly
outstretched Valeria was sleeping heavily He did not speedily succeed
in waking her  but as soon as she saw him she flung herself on his
neck and embraced him convulsively her whole body was quivering

What aileth thee my dear one what aileth thee said Fabio
repeatedly striving to soothe her

But she continued to lie as in a swoon on his breast Akh what
dreadful visions I see she whispered pressing her face against him

Fabio attempted to question her  but she merely trembled

The windowpanes were reddening with the first gleams of dawn when at
last she fell asleep in his arms




VIII


On the following day Muzio disappeared early in the morning and Valeria
informed her husband that she intended to betake herself to the
neighbouring monastery where dwelt her spiritual fatheran aged and
stately monk in whom she cherished unbounded confidence To Fabios
questions she replied that she desired to alleviate by confession her
soul which was oppressed with the impressions of the last few days As
he gazed at Valerias sunken visage as he listened to her faint voice
Fabio himself approved of her plan venerable Father Lorenzo might be
able to give her useful advice disperse her doubts Under the
protection of four escorts Valeria set out for the monastery but Fabio
remained at home and while awaiting the return of his wife he roamed
about the garden trying to understand what had happened to her and
feeling the unremitting terror and wrath and pain of indefinite
suspicions More than once he entered the pavilion but Muzio had not
returned and the Malay stared at Fabio like a statue with an
obsequious inclination of his head and a faraway grinat least so it
seemed to Fabioa faraway grin on his bronze countenance

In the meantime Valeria had narrated everything in confession to her
confessor being less ashamed than frightened The confessor listened to
her attentively blessed her absolved her from her involuntary
sinsbut thought to himself Magic diabolical witchcraft  things
cannot be left in this condition and accompanied Valeria to her
villa ostensibly for the purpose of definitely calming and comforting
her

At the sight of the confessor Fabio was somewhat startled but the
experienced old man had already thought out beforehand how he ought to
proceed On being left alone with Fabio he did not of course betray
the secrets of the confessional but he advised him to banish from his
house if that were possible his invited guest who by his tales
songs and his whole conduct had upset Valerias imagination Moreover
in the old mans opinion Muzio had not been firm in the faith in days
gone by as he now recalled to mind and after having sojourned so long
in regions not illuminated by the light of Christianity he might have
brought thence the infection of false doctrines he might even have
dabbled in magic and therefore although old friendship did assert its
rights still wise caution pointed to parting as indispensable

Fabio thoroughly agreed with the venerable monk Valeria even beamed all
over when her husband communicated to her her confessors counsel and
accompanied by the good wishes of both husband and wife and provided
with rich gifts for the monastery and the poor Father Lorenzo wended
his way home

Fabio had intended to have an explanation with Muzio directly after
supper but his strange guest did not return to supper Then Fabio
decided to defer the interview with Muzio until the following day and
husband and wife withdrew to their bedchamber




IX


Valeria speedily fell asleep but Fabio could not get to sleep In the
nocturnal silence all that he had seen all that he had felt presented
itself to him in a still more vivid manner with still greater
persistence did he ask himself questions to which as before he found
no answer Was Muzio really a magician And had he already poisoned
Valeria She was ill  but with what malady While he was engrossed in
painful meditations with his head propped on his hand and restraining
his hot breathing the moon again rose in the cloudless sky and
together with its rays through the semitransparent windowpanes in
the direction of the pavilion there began to stream inor did Fabio
merely imagine itthere began to stream in a breath resembling a
faint perfumed current of air

Now an importunate passionate whisper began to make itself heard 
and at that same moment he noticed that Valeria was beginning to stir
slightly He started gazed she rose thrust first one foot then the
other from the bed and like a somnambulist with her dull eyes
strained straight ahead and her arms extended before her she advanced
toward the door into the garden Fabio instantly sprang through the
other door of the bedroom and briskly running round the corner of the
house he closed the one which led into the garden He had barely
succeeded in grasping the handle when he felt some one trying to open
the door from within throwing their force against it  more and more
strongly  then frightened moans resounded

                                   

But Muzio cannot have returned from the town surely flashed through
Fabios head and he darted into the pavilion

What did he behold

Coming to meet him along the path brilliantly flooded with the radiance
of the moonlight also with arms outstretched and lifeless eyes staring
widelywas Muzio Fabio ran up to him but the other without
noticing him walked on advancing with measured steps and his
impassive face was smiling in the moonlight like the face of the Malay
Fabio tried to call him by name  but at that moment he heard a window
bang in the house behind him He glanced round

In fact the window of the bedroom was open from top to bottom and with
one foot thrust across the sill stood Valeria in the window  and her
arms seemed to be seeking Muzio her whole being was drawn toward him

Unspeakable wrath flooded Fabios breast in a suddenlyinvading
torrentAccursed sorcerer he yelled fiercely and seizing Muzio by
the throat with one hand he fumbled with the other for the dagger in
his belt and buried its blade to the hilt in his side

Muzio uttered a piercing shriek and pressing the palm of his hand to
the wound fled stumbling back to the pavilion But at that same
instant when Fabio stabbed him Valeria uttered an equally piercing
shriek and fell to the ground like one mowed down

Fabio rushed to her raised her up carried her to the bed spoke to
her

For a long time she lay motionless but at last she opened her eyes
heaved a deep sigh convulsively and joyously like a person who has
just been saved from inevitable deathcaught sight of her husband and
encircling his neck with her arms pressed herself to his breast

Thou thou it is thou she stammered Gradually the clasp of her arms
relaxed her head sank backward and whispering with a blissful
smileThank God all is over But how weary I amshe fell into
a profound but not heavy slumber




X


Fabio sank down beside her bed and never taking his eyes from her pale
emaciated but already tranquil face he began to reflect upon what had
taken place  and also upon how he ought to proceed now What was he
to do If he had slain Muzioand when he recalled how deeply the blade
of his dagger had penetrated he could not doubt that he had done
sothen it was impossible to conceal the fact He must bring it to the
knowledge of the Duke of the judges  but how was he to explain how
was he to narrate such an incomprehensible affair He Fabio had slain
in his own house his relative his best friend People would ask What
for For what cause But what if Muzio were not slainFabio had
not the strength to remain any longer in uncertainty and having made
sure that Valeria was asleep he cautiously rose from his armchair
left the house and directed his steps toward the pavilion All was
silent in it only in one window was a light visible With sinking heart
he opened the outer doora trace of bloody fingers still clung to it
and on the sand of the path drops of blood made black patches
raversed the first dark chamber  and halted on the threshold
petrified with astonishment

In the centre of the room on a Persian rug with a brocade cushion
under his head covered with a wide scarlet shawl with black figures
lay Muzio with all his limbs stiffly extended His face yellow as wax
with closed eyes and lids which had become blue was turned toward the
ceiling and no breath was to be detected he seemed to be dead At his
feet also enveloped in a scarlet shawl knelt the Malay He held in his
left hand a branch of some unfamiliar plant resembling a fern and
bending slightly forward he was gazing at his master never taking his
eyes from him A small torch thrust into the floor burned with a
greenish flame and was the only light in the room Its flame did not
flicker nor smoke

The Malay did not stir at Fabios entrance but merely darted a glance
at him and turned his eyes again upon Muzio From time to time he
raised himself a little and lowered the branch waving it through the
airand his dumb lips slowly parted and moved as though uttering
inaudible words Between Muzio and the Malay there lay upon the floor
the dagger with which Fabio had stabbed his friend The Malay smote the
bloodstained blade with his bough One minute passed  then another
Fabio approached the Malay and bending toward him he said in a low
voice Is he deadThe Malay bowed his head and disengaging his
right hand from beneath the shawl pointed imperiously to the door
Fabio was about to repeat his question but the imperious hand repeated
its gesture and Fabio left the room raging arid marvelling but
submitting

He found Valeria asleep as before with a still more tranquil face He
did not undress but seated himself by the window propped his head on
his hand and again became immersed in thought The rising sun found him
still in the same place Valeria had not wakened




XI


Fabio was intending to wait until she should awake and then go to
Ferrarawhen suddenly some one tapped lightly at the door of the
bedroom Fabio went out and beheld before him his aged majordomo
Antonio

Signor began the old man the Malay has just informed us that Signor
Muzio is ailing and desires to remove with all his effects to the town
and therefore he requests that you will furnish him with the aid of some
persons to pack his thingsand that you will send about dinnertime
both packand saddlehorses and a few men as guard Do you permit

Did the Malay tell thee that inquired Fabio In what manner For he
is dumb

Here signor is a paper on which he wrote all this in our language
very correctly

And Muzio is ill sayest thou

Yes very ill and he cannot be seen

Has not a physician been sent for

No the Malay would not allow it

And was it the Malay who wrote this for thee

Yes it was he

Fabio was silent for a space

Very well take the necessary measures he said at last

Antonio withdrew

Fabio stared after his servant in perplexitySo he was not
killedhe thought  and he did not know whether to rejoice or to
grieveHe is illBut a few hours ago he had beheld him a corpse

Fabio returned to Valeria She was awake and raised her head The
husband and wife exchanged a long significant look

Is he already dead said Valeria suddenlyFabio shuddered

What  he is notDidst thou Has he gone away she went on

Fabios heart was relievedNot yet but he is going away today

And I shall never never see him again

Never

And those visions will not be repeated

No

Valeria heaved another sigh of relief a blissful smile again made its
appearance on her lips She put out both hands to her husband

And we shall never speak of him never hearest thou my dear one And
I shall not leave this room until he is gone But now do thou send me my
servingwomen  and stay take that thingshe pointed to a pearl
necklace which lay on the nightstand the necklace which Muzio had
given herand throw it immediately into our deep well Embrace meI
am thy Valeriaand do not come to me until  that man is gone

Fabio took the necklaceits pearls seemed to have grown dimand
fulfilled his wifes behest Then he began to roam about the garden
gazing from a distance at the pavilion around which the bustle of
packing was already beginning Men were carrying out chests lading
horses  but the Malay was not among them An irresistible feeling
drew Fabio to gaze once more on what was going on in the pavilion He
recalled the fact that in its rear faade there was a secret door
through which one might penetrate to the interior of the chamber where
Muzio had been lying that morning He stole up to that door found it
unlocked and pushing aside the folds of a heavy curtain darted in an
irresolute glance




XII


Muzio was no longer lying on the rug Dressed in travelling attire he
was sitting in an armchair but appeared as much of a corpse as at
Fabios first visit The petrified head had fallen against the back of
the chair the hands lay flat motionless and yellow on the knees His
breast did not heave Round about the chair on the floor strewn with
dried herbs stood several flat cups filled with a dark liquid which
gave off a strong almost suffocating odourthe odour of musk Around
each cup was coiled a small coppercoloured serpent which gleamed here
and there with golden spots and directly in front of Muzio a couple of
paces distant from him rose up the tall figure of the Malay clothed in
a motleyhued mantle of brocade girt about with a tigers tail with a
tall cap in the form of a horned tiara on his head

But he was not motionless now he made devout obeisances and seemed to
be praying again he drew himself up to his full height even stood on
tiptoe now he threw his hands apart in broad and measured sweep now he
waved them urgently in the direction of Muzio and seemed to be menacing
or commanding with them as he contracted his brows in a frown and
stamped his foot All these movements evidently cost him great effort
and even caused him suffering he breathed heavily the sweat streamed
from his face Suddenly he stood stockstill on one spot and inhaling
the air into his lungs and scowling he stretched forward then drew
toward him his clenched fists as though he were holding reins in
them  and to Fabios indescribable horror Muzios head slowly
separated itself from the back of the chair and reached out after the
Malays hands The Malay dropped his hands and Muzios head again
sank heavily backward the Malay repeated his gestures and the obedient
head repeated them after him The dark liquid in the cups began to
seethe with a faint sound the very cups themselves emitted a faint
tinkling and the copper snakes began to move around each of them in
undulating motion Then the Malay advanced a pace and elevating his
eyebrows very high and opening his eyes until they were of huge size he
nodded his head at Muzio  and the eyelids of the corpse began to
flutter parted unevenly and from beneath them the pupils dull as lead
revealed themselves With proud triumph and joya joy that was almost
maliciousbeamed the face of the Malay he opened his lips widely and
from the very depths of his throat a prolonged roar wrested itself with
an effort Muzios lips parted also and a faint groan trembled on
them in reply to that inhuman sound

But at this point Fabio could endure it no longer he fancied that he
was witnessing some devilish incantations He also uttered a shriek and
started off at a run homeward without looking behind himhomeward as
fast as he could go praying and crossing himself as he ran




XIII


Three hours later Antonio presented himself before him with the report
that everything was ready all the things were packed and Signor Muzio
was preparing to depart Without uttering a word in answer to his
servant Fabio stepped out on the terrace whence the pavilion was
visible Several packhorses were grouped in front of it at the porch
itself a powerful black stallion with a roomy saddle adapted for two
riders was drawn up There also stood the servants with bared heads and
the armed escort The door of the pavilion opened and supported by the
Malay Muzio made his appearance His face was deathlike and his arms
hung down like those of a corpsebut he walked  yes he put one
foot before the other and once mounted on the horse he held himself
upright and got hold of the reins by fumbling The Malay thrust his
feet into the stirrups sprang up behind him on the saddle encircled
his waist with his armand the whole procession set out The horses
proceeded at a walk and when they made the turn in front of the house
Fabio fancied that on Muzios dark countenance two small white patches
gleamed Could it be that he had turned his eyes that wayThe Malay
alone saluted him  mockingly but as usual

Did Valeria see all this The shutters of her windows were closed 
but perhaps she was standing behind them




XIV


At dinnertime she entered the diningroom and was very quiet and
affectionate but she still complained of being weary Yet there was no
agitation about her nor any of her former constant surprise and secret
fear and when on the day after Muzios departure Fabio again set
about her portrait he found in her features that pure expression the
temporary eclipse of which had so disturbed him  and his brush flew
lightly and confidently over the canvas

Husband and wife began to live their life as of yore Muzio had vanished
for them as though he had never existed And both Fabio and Valeria
seemed to have entered into a compact not to recall him by a single
sound not to inquire about his further fate and it remained a mystery
for all others as well Muzio really did vanish as though he had sunk
through the earth One day Fabio thought himself bound to relate to
Valeria precisely what had occurred on that fateful night  but she
probably divining his intention held her breath and her eyes narrowed
as though she were anticipating a blow And Fabio understood her he
did not deal her that blow

One fine autumnal day Fabio was putting the finishing touches to the
picture of his Cecilia Valeria was sitting at the organ and her
fingers were wandering over the keys Suddenly contrary to her own
volition from beneath her fingers rang out that Song of Love Triumphant
which Muzio had once playedand at that same instant for the first
time since her marriage she felt within her the palpitation of a new
germinating life Valeria started and stopped short

What was the meaning of this Could it be

With this word the manuscript came to an end






CLARA MLITCH

A TALE






I


In the spring of  there lived in Moscow in a small wooden house on
Shablovka Street a young man fiveandtwenty years of age Ykoff
Artoff by name With him lived his aunt an old maid over fifty years
of age his fathers sister Platonda Ivnovna She managed his
housekeeping and took charge of his expenditures of which Artoff was
utterly incapable He had no other relations Several years before his
father a petty and not wealthy noble of the T government had
removed to Moscow together with him and Platonda Ivnovna who by the
way was always called Platsha and her nephew called her so too When
he quitted the country where all of them had constantly dwelt hitherto
old Artoff had settled in the capital with the object of placing his
son in the university for which he had himself prepared him he
purchased for a trifling sum a small house on one of the remote streets
and installed himself therein with all his books and preparations And
of books and preparations he had many for he was a man not devoid of
learning  a supernatural eccentric according to the words of his
neighbours He even bore among them the reputation of a magician he had
even received the nickname of the insectobserver He busied himself
with chemistry mineralogy entomology botany and medicine he treated
voluntary patients with herbs and metallic powders of his own
concoction after the method of Paracelsus With those same powders he
had sent into the grave his young pretty but already too delicate
wife whom he had passionately loved and by whom he had had an only
son With those same metallic powders he had wrought considerable havoc
with the health of his son also which on the contrary he had wished
to reinforce as he detected in his organisation anmia and a tendency
to consumption inherited from his mother The title of magician he had
acquired among other things from the fact that he considered himself a
greatgrandsonnot in the direct line of courseof the famous Bruce
in whose honour he had named his son Ykoff He was the sort of man
who is called very goodnatured but of a melancholy temperament
fussy and timid with a predilection for everything that was mysterious
or mystical Ah uttered in a halfwhisper was his customary
exclamation and he died with that exclamation on his lips two years
after his removal to Moscow

His son Ykoff did not in outward appearance resemble his father who
had been homely in person clumsy and awkward he reminded one rather of
his mother There were the same delicate pretty features the same soft
hair of ashblonde hue the same plump childish lips and large
languishing greenishgrey eyes and feathery eyelashes On the other
hand in disposition he resembled his father and his face which did not
resemble his fathers bore the stamp of his fathers expression and he
had angular arms and a sunken chest like old Artoff who by the way
should hardly be called an old man since he did not last to the age of
fifty During the latters lifetime Ykoff had already entered the
university in the physicomathematical faculty but he did not finish
his coursenot out of idleness but because according to his ideas a
person can learn no more in the university than he can teach himself at
home and he did not aspire to a diploma as he was not intending to
enter the government service He avoided his comrades made acquaintance
with hardly any one was especially shy of women and lived a very
isolated life immersed in his books He was shy of women although he
had a very tender heart and was captivated by beauty He even
acquired the luxury of an English keepsake and Oh for shame admired
the portraits of divers bewitching Gulnares and Medoras which adorned
it But his inborn modesty constantly restrained him At home he
occupied his late fathers study which had also been his bedroom and
his bed was the same on which his father had died

The great support of his whole existence his unfailing comrade and
friend was his aunt that Platsha with whom he exchanged barely ten
words a day but without whom he could not take a step She was a
longvisaged longtoothed being with pale eyes in a pale face and an
unvarying expression partly of sadness partly of anxious alarm
Eternally attired in a grey gown and a grey shawl which was redolent of
camphor she wandered about the house like a shadow with noiseless
footsteps she sighed whispered prayersespecially one her favourite
which consisted of two words Lord helpand managed the
housekeeping very vigorously hoarding every kopk and buying everything
herself She worshipped her nephew she was constantly fretting about
his health was constantly in a state of alarm not about herself but
about him and as soon as she thought there was anything the matter with
him she would quietly approach and place on his writingtable a cup of
herbtea or stroke his back with her hands which were as soft as
wadding

This coddling did not annoy Ykoff but he did not drink the herbtea
and only nodded approvingly But neither could he boast of his health
He was extremely sensitive nervous suspicious he suffered from
palpitation of the heart and sometimes from asthma Like his father he
believed that there existed in nature and in the soul of man secrets of
which glimpses may sometimes be caught though they cannot be
understood he believed in the presence of certain forces and
influences sometimes welldisposed but more frequently hostile  and
he also believed in sciencein its dignity and worth Of late he had
conceived a passion for photography The odour of the ingredients used
in that connection greatly disturbed his old auntagain not on her own
behalf but for Yshas sake on account of his chest But with all his
gentleness of disposition he possessed no small portion of stubbornness
and he diligently pursued his favourite occupation Platsha
submitted and merely sighed more frequently than ever and whispered
Lord help as she gazed at his fingers stained with iodine

Ykoff as has already been stated shunned his comrades but with one
of them he struck up a rather close friendship and saw him frequently
even after that comrade on leaving the university entered the
government service which however was not very exacting to use his
own words he had tacked himself on to the building of the Church of
the Saviour without of course knowing anything whatever about
architecture Strange to say that solitary friend of Artoffs Kupfer
by name a German who was Russified to the extent of not knowing a
single word of German and even used the epithet German as a term
of opprobriumthat friend had to all appearance nothing in common
with him He was a jolly rosycheeked young fellow with black curly
hair loquacious and very fond of that feminine society which Artoff
so shunned Truth to tell Kupfer breakfasted and dined with him rather
often and evenas he was not a rich manborrowed small sums of money
from him but it was not that which made the freeandeasy German so
diligently frequent the little house on Shablovka Street He had taken
a liking to Ykoffs spiritual purity his idealitypossibly as a
contrast to what he daily encountered and beheldor perhaps in that
same attraction toward ideality the young mans German blood revealed
itself And Ykoff liked Kupfers goodnatured frankness and in
addition to this his tales of the theatres concerts and balls which
he constantly attendedin general of that alien world into which Ykoff
could not bring himself to penetratesecretly interested and even
excited the young recluse yet without arousing in him a desire to test
all this in his own experience And Platsha liked Kupfer she sometimes
thought him too unceremonious it is true but instinctively feeling and
understanding that he was sincerely attached to her beloved Ysha she
not only tolerated the noisy visitor but even felt a kindness for him




II


At the time of which we are speaking there was in Moscow a certain
widow a Georgian Princessa person of illdefined standing and almost
a suspicious character She was about forty years of age in her youth
she had probably bloomed with that peculiar oriental beauty which so
quickly fades now she powdered and painted herself and dyed her hair a
yellow hue Various not altogether favourable and not quite definite
rumours were in circulation about her no one had known her husbandand
in no one city had she lived for any length of time She had neither
children nor property but she lived on a lavish scaleon credit or
otherwise She held a salon as the saying is and received a decidedly
mixed companychiefly composed of young men Her whole establishment
beginning with her own toilette furniture and table and ending with
her equipage and staff of servants bore a certain stamp of inferiority
artificiality transitoriness  but neither the Princess herself nor
her guests apparently demanded anything better The Princess was
reputed to be fond of music and literature to be a patroness of actors
and artists and she really did take an interest in these questions
even to an enthusiastic degreeand even to a pitch of rapture which was
not altogether simulated She indubitably did possess the sthetic
chord Moreover she was very accessible amiable devoid of
pretensions of affectation anda fact which many did not suspectin
reality extremely kind tenderhearted and obliging Rare qualities
and therefore all the more precious precisely in individuals of that
stamp

A frivolous woman one clever person said concerning her and she
will infallibly get into paradise For she forgives everythingand
everything will be forgiven herIt was also said concerning her that
when she disappeared from any town she always left behind her as many
creditors as persons whom she had loaded with benefits A soft heart can
be pressed in any direction you like

Kupfer as was to be expected was a visitor at her house and became
very intimate with her  altogether too intimate so malicious tongues
asserted But he always spoke of her not only in a friendly manner but
also with respect he lauded her as a woman of goldinterpret that as
you pleaseand was a firm believer in her love for art and in her
comprehension of artSo then one day after dinner at the Artoffs
after having discussed the Princess and her evening gatherings he began
to urge Ykoff to break in upon his life of an anchorite for once and
permit him Kupfer to introduce him to his friend At first Ykoff
would not hear to anything of the sort

Why what idea hast thou got into thy head exclaimed Kupfer at last
What sort of a presentation is in question I shall simply take thee
just as thou art now sitting there in thy frockcoat and conduct thee
to her evening They do not stand on ceremony in the least there
brother Here now thou art learned and thou art fond of music there
actually was in Artoffs study a small piano on which he occasionally
struck a few chords in diminished seventhsand in her house there is
any quantity of that sort of thing And there thou wilt meet
sympathetic people without any airs And in conclusion it is not
right that at thy age with thy personal appearance Artoff dropped
his eyes and waved his handyes yes with thy personal appearance
thou shouldst shun society the world in this manner Im not going to
take thee to call on generals seest thou Moreover I dont know any
generals myself Dont be stubborn my dear fellow Morality is a
good thing a thing worthy of respect But why give thyself up to
asceticism Assuredly thou art not preparing to become a monk

Artoff continued nevertheless to resist but Platonda Ivnovna
unexpectedly came to Kupfers assistance Although she did not quite
understand the meaning of the word asceticism still she also thought
that it would not be a bad idea for Yshenka to divert himself to take
a look at peopleand show himselfThe more so she added that I
have confidence in Fedor Fedoritch He will not take thee to any bad
place

Ill restore him to thee in all his pristine purity cried Kupfer at
whom Platonda Ivnovna in spite of her confidence kept casting
uneasy glances Artoff blushed to his very earsbut he ceased to
object

It ended in Kupfer taking him on the following day to the Princesss
evening assembly But Artoff did not remain there long In the first
place he found at her house about twenty guests men and women who
were presumably sympathetic but who were strangers to him
nevertheless and this embarrassed him although he was obliged to talk
very little but he feared this most of all In the second place he did
not like the hostess herself although she welcomed him very cordially
and unaffectedly Everything about her displeased him her painted face
and her churnedup curls and her hoarselymellifluous voice her shrill
laugh her way of rolling up her eyes her too dcollet bodiceand
those plump shiny fingers with a multitude of rings Slinking off
into a corner he now swiftly ran his eyes over the faces of all the
guests as though he did not even distinguish one from another again he
stared persistently at his own feet But when at last an artist who
had just come to town with a drinksodden countenance extremely long
hair and a bit of glass under his puckered brow seated himself at the
piano and bringing down his hands on the keys and his feet on the
pedals with a flourish began to bang out a fantasia by Liszt on a
Wagnerian theme Artoff could stand it no longer and slipped away
bearing in his soul a confused and oppressive impression athwart which
nevertheless there pierced something which he did not understand but
which was significant and even agitating




III


Kupfer came on the following day to dinner but he did not enlarge upon
the preceding evening he did not even reproach Artoff for his hasty
flight and merely expressed regret that he had not waited for supper
at which champagne had been served of Nzhegorod fabrication we
may remark in parenthesis

Kupfer probably understood that he had made a mistake in trying to
rouse his friend and that Artoff was a man who positively was not
adapted to that sort of society and manner of life On his side Artoff
also did not allude to the Princess or to the night before Platonda
Ivnovna did not know whether to rejoice at the failure of this first
attempt or to regret it She decided at last that Yshas health might
suffer from such expeditions and regained her complacency Kupfer went
away directly after dinner and did not show himself again for a whole
week And that not because he was sulking at Artoff for the failure of
his introductionthe goodnatured fellow was incapable of such a
thingbut he had evidently found some occupation which engrossed all
his time all his thoughtsfor thereafter he rarely came to the
Artoffs wore an abstracted aspect and soon vanished Artoff
continued to live on as before but some hitch if we may so express
ourselves had secured lodgment in his soul He still recalled something
or other without himself being quite aware what it was preciselyand
that something referred to the evening which he had spent at the
Princesss house Nevertheless he had not the slightest desire to
return to it and society a section of which he had inspected in her
house repelled him more than ever Thus passed six weeks

And lo one morning Kupfer again presented himself to him this time
with a somewhat embarrassed visage

I know he began with a forced laugh that thy visit that evening
was not to thy taste but I hope that thou wilt consent to my proposal
nevertheless  and wilt not refuse my request

What art thou talking about inquired Artoff

See here pursued Kupfer becoming more and more animated there
exists here a certain society of amateurs and artists which from time
to time organises readings concerts even theatrical representations
for philanthropic objects

And the Princess takes part interrupted Artoff

The Princess always takes part in good worksbut that is of no
consequence We have got up a literary and musical morning  and at
that performance thou mayest hear a young girl  a remarkable young
girlWe do not quite know as yet whether she will turn out a Rachel
or a Viardot  for she sings splendidly and declaims and acts She
has talent of the first class my dear fellow I am not
exaggeratingSo here now  wilt not thou take a ticketFive rubles
if thou wishest the first row

And where did this wonderful young girl come from asked Artoff

Kupfer grinnedThat I cannot say Of late she has found an asylum
with the Princess The Princess as thou knowest is a patron of all
such people And it is probable that thou sawest her that evening

Artoff started inwardly faintly  but made no answer

She has even acted somewhere in country districts went on Kupfer
and on the whole she was created for the theatre Thou shalt see for
thyself

Is her name Clara asked Artoff

Yes Clara

Clara interrupted Artoff againIt cannot be

Why notClara it is  Clara Mlitch that is not her real name 
but that is what she is called She is to sing a romance by Glinka 
and one by Tchaikvsky and then she will recite the letter from Evgny
OnyginCome now Wilt thou take a ticket

But when is it to be

Tomorrow  tomorrow at halfpast one in a private hall on
Ostozhynka Street I will come for thee A ticket at five rubles
Here it is No this is a threeruble ticketHere it isAnd here
is the afficheI am one of the managers

Artoff reflected Platonda Ivnovna entered the room at that moment
and glancing at his face was suddenly seized with agitationYsha
she exclaimed what ails thee Why art thou so excited Fedor
Fedorovitch what hast thou been saying to him

But Artoff did not give his friend a chance to answer his aunts
question and hastily seizing the ticket which was held out to him he
ordered Platonda Ivnovna to give Kupfer five rubles on the instant

She was amazed and began to blink her eyes Nevertheless she handed
Kupfer the money in silence Yshenka had shouted at her in a very
severe manner

Shes a marvel of marvels I tell thee cried Kupfer darting toward
the doorExpect me tomorrow

Has she black eyes called Artoff after him

As black as coal merrily roared Kupfer and disappeared

Artoff went off to his own room while Platonda Ivnovna remained
rooted to the spot repeating Help Lord Lord help




IV


The large hall in a private house on Ostozhynka Street was already half
filled with spectators when Artoff and Kupfer arrived Theatrical
representations were sometimes given in that hall but on this occasion
neither stagescenery nor curtain were visible Those who had organised
the morning had confined themselves to erecting a platform at one end
placing thereon a piano and a couple of musicracks a few chairs a
table with a carafe of water and a glass and hanging a curtain of red
cloth over the door which led to the room set apart for the artists In
the first row the Princess was already seated clad in a bright green
gown Artoff placed himself at some distance from her after barely
exchanging a bow with her The audience was what is called motley it
consisted chiefly of young men from various institutions of learning
Kupfer in his quality of a manager with a white ribbon on the lapel of
his dresscoat bustled and fussed about with all his might the
Princess was visibly excited kept looking about her launching smiles
in all directions and chatting with her neighbours  there were only
men in her immediate vicinity

The first to make his appearance on the platform was a fluteplayer of
consumptive aspect who spat out  that is to say piped out a piece
which was consumptive like himself Two persons shouted Bravo Then a
fat gentleman in spectacles very sedate and even grim of aspect
recited in a bass voice a sketch by Shtchedrn the audience
applauded the sketch not himThen the pianist who was already known
to Artoff presented himself and pounded out the same Liszt fantasia
the pianist was favoured with a recall He bowed with his hand resting
on the back of a chair and after each bow he tossed back his hair
exactly like Liszt At last after a decidedly long intermission the
red cloth over the door at the rear of the platform moved was drawn
widely apart and Clara Mlitch made her appearance The hall rang with
applause With unsteady steps she approached the front of the platform
came to a halt and stood motionless with her large red ungloved
hands crossed in front of her making no curtsey neither bending her
head nor smiling

She was a girl of nineteen tall rather broadshouldered but well
built Her face was swarthy partly Hebrew partly Gipsy in type her
eyes were small and black beneath thick brows which almost met her nose
was straight slightly upturned her lips were thin with a beautiful
but sharp curve she had a huge braid of black hair which was heavy
even to the eye a low impassive stony brow tiny ears  her whole
countenance was thoughtful almost surly A passionate selfwilled
naturenot likely to be either kindly or even intelligentbut
gifted was manifested by everything about her

For a while she did not raise her eyes but suddenly gave a start and
sent her intent but not attentive glance which seemed to be buried in
herself along the rows of spectators

What tragic eyes remarked a certain greyhaired fop who sat behind
Artoff with the face of a courtesan from Revelone of Moscows
wellknown firstnighters and rounders The fop was stupid and intended
to utter a bit of nonsense  but he had spoken the truth Artoff who
had never taken his eyes from Clara since she had made her appearance
only then recalled that he actually had seen her at the Princesss and
had not only seen her but had even noticed that she had several times
looked at him with particular intentness out of her dark watchful eyes
And on this occasion also  or did he merely fancy that it was soon
catching sight of him in the first row she seemed to be delighted
seemed to blushand again she gazed intently at him Then without
turning round she retreated a couple of paces in the direction of the
piano at which the accompanist the longhaired foreigner was already
seated She was to execute Glinkas romance As soon as I recognised
thee She immediately began to sing without altering the position
of her hands and without glancing at the notes Her voice was soft and
resonanta contraltoshe pronounced her words distinctly and
forcibly and sang monotonously without shading but with strong
expression

The lass sings with conviction remarked the same fop who sat behind
Artoffand again he spoke the truth

Shouts of Bis Bravo resounded all about but she merely darted a
swift glance at Artoff who was neither shouting nor clappinghe had
not been particularly pleased by her singingmade a slight bow and
withdrew without taking the arm of the hairy pianist which he had
crooked out like a cracknel She was recalled  but it was some time
before she made her appearance advanced to the piano with the same
uncertain tread as before and after whispering a couple of words to her
accompanist who was obliged to get and place on the rack before him not
the music he had prepared but something elseshe began Tchaikvskys
romance No only he who hath felt the thirst of meeting This
romance she sang in a different way from the firstin an undertone as
though she were weary  and only in the line before the last He will
understand how I have suffereddid a ringing burning cry burst from
her The last line And how I suffer she almost whispered sadly
prolonging the final word This romance produced a slighter impression
on the audience than Glinkas but there was a great deal of
applause Kupfer in particular distinguished himself he brought
his hands together in a peculiar manner in the form of a cask when he
clapped thereby producing a remarkably sonorous noise The Princess
gave him a large dishevelled bouquet which he was to present to the
songstress but the latter did not appear to perceive Kupfers bowed
figure and his hand outstretched with the bouquet and she turned and
withdrew again without waiting for the pianist who had sprung to his
feet with still greater alacrity than before to escort her and who
being thus left in the lurch shook his hair as Liszt himself in all
probability never shook his

During the whole time she was singing Artoff had been scanning Claras
face It seemed to him that her eyes athwart her contracted lashes
were again turned on him But he was particularly struck by the
impassiveness of that face that forehead those brows and only when
she uttered her passionate cry did he notice a row of white closelyset
teeth gleaming warmly from between her barely parted lips Kupfer
stepped up to him

Well brother what dost thou think of her he asked all beaming with
satisfaction

She has a fine voice replied Artoff but she does not know how to
sing yet she has had no real school Why he said this and what he
meant by school the Lord only knows

Kupfer was surprisedShe has no school he repeated slowly
Well now She can still study But on the other hand what soul
But just wait until thou hast heard her recite Tatynas letter

He ran away from Artoff and the latter thought Soul With that
impassive faceHe thought that she bore herself and moved like a
hypnotised person like a somnambulist And at the same time she
was indubitably Yes she was indubitably staring at him

Meanwhile the morning went on The fat man in spectacles presented
himself again despite his serious appearance he imagined that he was a
comic artist and read a scene from Ggol this time without evoking a
single token of approbation The fluteplayer flitted past once more
again the pianist thundered a young fellow of twenty pomaded and
curled but with traces of tears on his cheeks sawed out some
variations on his fiddle It might have appeared strange that in the
intervals between the recitations and the music the abrupt notes of a
French horn were wafted now and then from the artists room but this
instrument was not used nevertheless It afterward came out that the
amateur who had offered to perform on it had been seized with a panic at
the moment when he should have made his appearance before the audience
So at last Clara Mlitch appeared again

She held in her hand a small volume of Pshkin but during her reading
she never once glanced at it She was obviously frightened the
little book shook slightly in her fingers Artoff also observed the
expression of dejection which now overspread her stern features The
first line I write to you  what would you more she uttered with
extreme simplicity almost ingenuouslystretching both arms out in
front of her with an ingenuous sincere helpless gesture Then she
began to hurry a little but beginning with the line Another Nay to
none on earth could I have given eer my heart she regained her
selfpossession and grew animated and when she reached the words
All all life hath been a pledge of faithful meeting thus with
theeher hitherto rather dull voice rang out enthusiastically and
boldly and her eyes riveted themselves on Artoff with a boldness and
directness to match She went on with the same enthusiasm and only
toward the close did her voice again fall and in it and in her face her
previous dejection was again depicted She made a complete muddle as
the saying is of the last four linesthe little volume of Pshkin
suddenly slipped from her hands and she beat a hasty retreat

The audience set to applauding and recalling her in desperate
fashion One theological studenta Little Russianamong others
bellowed so loudly Muluitch Muluitch that his neighbour
politely and sympathetically begged him to spare himself as a future
protodeacon But Artoff immediately rose and betook himself to
the entrance Kupfer overtook him

Good gracious whither art thou going he yelledIll introduce
thee to Clara if thou wishestshall I

No thanks hastily replied Artoff and set off homeward almost at a
run




V


Strange emotions which were not clear even to himself agitated him In
reality Claras recitation had not altogether pleased him either 
altogether he could not tell precisely why It had troubled him that
recitation it had seemed to him harsh unmelodious Somehow it
seemed to have broken something within him to have exerted some sort of
violence And those importunate persistent almost insolent
glanceswhat had caused them What did they signify

Artoffs modesty did permit him even a momentary thought that he might
have pleased that strange young girl that he might have inspired her
with a sentiment akin to love to passion And he had imagined to
himself quite otherwise that as yet unknown woman that young girl to
whom he would surrender himself wholly and who would love him become
his bride his wife He rarely dreamed of this he was chaste both in
body and soulbut the pure image which rose up in his imagination at
such times was evoked under another formthe form of his dead mother
whom he barely remembered though he cherished her portrait like a
sacred treasure That portrait had been painted in watercolours in a
rather inartistic manner by a friendly neighbour but the likeness was
striking as every one averred The woman the young girl whom as yet
he did not so much as venture to expect must possess just such a tender
profile just such kind bright eyes just such silky hair just such a
smile just such a clear understanding

But this was a blackvisaged swarthy creature with coarse hair and a
moustache on her lip she must certainly be badtempered giddy A
gipsy Artoff could not devise a worse expressionwhat was she to
him

And in the meantime Artoff was unable to banish from his mind that
blackvisaged gipsy whose singing and recitation and even whose
personal appearance were disagreeable to him He was perplexed he was
angry with himself Not long before this he had read Walter Scotts
romance Saint Ronans Well there was a complete edition of Walter
Scotts works in the library of his father who revered the English
romancewriter as a serious almost a learned author The heroine of
that romance is named Clara Mowbray A poet of the s Krsoff wrote
a poem about her which wound up with the words

    Unhappy Clara foolish Clara
    Unhappy Clara Mowbray

Artoff was acquainted with this poem also And now these words kept
incessantly recurring to his memory Unhappy Clara foolish
Clara That was why he had been so surprised when Kupfer mentioned
Clara Mlitch to him Even Platsha noticed not precisely a change in
Ykoffs frame of mindas a matter of fact no change had taken
placebut something wrong about his looks in his remarks She
cautiously interrogated him about the literary morning at which he had
been presentshe whispered sighed scrutinised him from in front
scrutinised him from the side from behindand suddenly slapping her
hands on her thighs she exclaimed

Well YshalI see what the trouble is

What dost thou mean queried Artoff in his turn

Thou hast certainly met at that morning some one of those
taildraggers that was what Platonda Ivnovna called all ladies who
wore fashionable gowns She has a comely faceand she puts on airs
like thisand twists her face like this Platsha depicted all
this in her face and she makes her eyes go round like this she
mimicked this also describing huge circles in the air with her
forefinger And it made an impression on thee because thou art not
used to it But that does not signify anything Ysha  it does not
signify anything Drink a cup of herbtea when thou goest to bed and
that will be the end of it Lord help

Platsha ceased speaking and took herself off She probably had never
made such a long and animated speech before since she was born  but
Artoff thought

I do believe my aunt is right It is all because I am not used to
such things He really had attracted the attention of the female
sex to himself for the first time  at any rate he had never noticed
it before I must not indulge myself

So he set to work at his books and drank some lindenflower tea when he
went to bed and even slept well all that night and had no dreams On
the following morning he busied himself with his photography as though
nothing had happened

But toward evening his spiritual serenity was again disturbed




VI


To wit a messenger brought him a note written in a large irregular
feminine hand which ran as follows

If you guess who is writing to you and if it does not bore you come
tomorrow after dinner to the Tver boulevardabout five oclockand
wait You will not be detained long But it is very important Come

There was no signature Artoff instantly divined who his correspondent
was and that was precisely what disturbed himWhat nonsense he
said almost aloud This is too much Of course I shall not
goNevertheless he ordered the messenger to be summoned and from
him he learned merely that the letter had been handed to him on the
street by a maid Having dismissed him Artoff reread the letter and
flung it on the floor But after a while he picked it up and read it
over again a second time he cried Nonsense He did not throw the
letter on the floor this time however but put it away in a drawer

Artoff went about his customary avocations busying himself now with
one now with another but his work did not make progress was not a
success Suddenly he noticed that he was waiting for Kupfer that he
wanted to interrogate him or even communicate something to him But
Kupfer did not make his appearance Then Artoff got Pshkin and read
Tatynas letter and again felt convinced that that gipsy had not in
the least grasped the meaning of the letter But there was that jester
Kupfer shouting A Rachel A Viardot Then he went to his piano
raised the cover in an abstracted sort of way tried to search out in
his memory the melody of Tchaikvskys romance but he immediately
banged to the pianolid with vexation and went to his aunt in her own
room which was always kept very hot and was forever redolent of mint
sage and other medicinal herbs and crowded with such a multitude of
rugs tagres little benches cushions and various articles of
softlystuffed furniture that it was difficult for an inexperienced
person to turn round in it and breathing was oppressive Platonda
Ivnovna was sitting by the window with her knittingneedles in her hand
she was knitting a scarf for Yshenkathe thirtyeighth by actual
count during the course of his existenceand was greatly surprised
Artoff rarely entered her room and if he needed anything he always
shouted in a shrill voice from his study Aunt PlatshaBut she made
him sit down and in anticipation of his first words pricked up her
ears as she stared at him through her round spectacles with one eye
and above them with the other She did not inquire after his health and
did not offer him tea for she saw that he had not come for that
Artoff hesitated for a while  then began to talk  to talk about
his mother about the way she had lived with his father and how his
father had made her acquaintance He knew all this perfectly well 
but he wanted to talk precisely about that Unluckily for him Platsha
did not know how to converse in the least she made very brief replies
as though she suspected that Ysha had not come for that purpose

Certainlyshe kept repeating hurriedly as she plied her
knittingneedles almost in an angry way Every one knows that thy
mother was a dove  a regular dove And thy father loved her as a
husband should love faithfully and honourably to the very grave and
he never loved any other womanshe added elevating her voice and
removing her spectacles

And was she of a timid disposition asked Artoff after a short
pause

Certainly she was As is fitting for the female sex The bold ones are
a recent invention

And were there no bold ones in your time

There were such even in our day  of course there were But who were
they Some streetwalker or shameless hussy or other She would drag
her skirts about and fling herself hither and thither at random
What did she care What anxiety had she If a young fool came along he
fell into her hands But steadygoing people despised them Dost thou
remember ever to have beheld such in our house

Artoff made no reply and returned to his study Platonda Ivnovna
gazed after him shook her head and again donned her spectacles again
set to work on her scarf  but more than once she fell into thought
and dropped her knittingneedles on her knee

And Artoff until nightfall kept again and again beginning with the
same vexation the same ire as before to think about the gipsy the
appointed tryst to which he certainly would not go During the night
also she worried him He kept constantly seeing her eyes now narrowed
now widely opened with their importunate gaze riveted directly on him
and those impassive features with their imperious expression

On the following morning he again kept expecting Kupfer for some reason
or other he came near writing him a letter  however he did
nothing  but spent most of his time pacing to and fro in his study
Not for one instant did he even admit to himself the thought that he
would go to that stupid rendezvous  and at halfpast four after
having swallowed his dinner in haste he suddenly donned his overcoat
and pulling his cap down on his brows he stole out of the house without
letting his aunt see him and wended his way to the Tver boulevard




VII


Artoff found few pedestrians on the boulevard The weather was raw and
quite cold He strove not to think of what he was doing He forced
himself to turn his attention to all the objects he came across and
pretended to assure himself that he had come out to walk precisely like
the other people The letter of the day before was in his
sidepocket and he was uninterruptedly conscious of its presence He
walked the length of the boulevard a couple of times darting keen
glances at every feminine form which approached him and his heart
thumped thumped violently He began to feel tired and sat down on a
bench And suddenly the idea occurred to him Come now what if that
letter was not written by her but by some one else by some other
woman In point of fact that should have made no difference to him 
and yet he was forced to admit to himself that he did not wish this It
would be very stupid he thought still more stupid than that A
nervous restlessness began to take possession of him he began to feel
chilly not outwardly but inwardly Several times he drew out his watch
from his waistcoat pocket glanced at the face put it back againand
every time forgot how many minutes were lacking to five oclock It
seemed to him as though every one who passed him stared at him in a
peculiar manner surveying him with a certain sneering surprise and
curiosity A wretched little dog ran up sniffed at his legs and began
to wag its tail He flourished his arms angrily at it He was most
annoyed of all by a small boy from a factory in a bedticking jacket
who seated himself on the bench and first whistled then scratched his
head dangling his legs encased in huge broken boots the while and
staring at him from time to time His employer is certainly expecting
him thought Artoff and here he is the lazy dog wasting his time
idling about

But at that same moment it seemed to him as though some one had
approached and taken up a stand close behind him  a warm current
emanated thence

He glanced round It was she

He recognised her immediately although a thick darkblue veil
concealed her features He instantly sprang from the bench and remained
standing there unable to utter a word She also maintained silence He
felt greatly agitated  but her agitation was as great as his Artoff
could not help seeing even through the veil how deadly pale she grew
But she was the first to speak

Thank you she began in a broken voice thank you for coming I did
not hope She turned away slightly and walked along the boulevard
Artoff followed her

Perhaps you condemn me she went on without turning her headAs a
matter of fact my action is very strange But I have heard a great
deal about you  but no I  that was not the cause If you only
knew I wanted to say so much to you my God But how am I to do
it How am I to do it

Artoff walked by her side but a little in the rear He did not see her
face he saw only her hat and a part of her veil  and her long
threadbare cloak All his vexation against her and against himself
suddenly returned to him all the absurdity all the awkwardness of this
tryst of these explanations between utter strangers on a public
boulevard suddenly presented itself to him

I have come hither at your behest he began in his turn I have come
my dear madame her shoulders quivered softly she turned into a side
path and he followed her merely for the sake of having an
explanation of learning in consequence of what strange misunderstanding
you were pleased to appeal to me a stranger to you who  who only
guessed as you expressed it in your letter that it was precisely you
who had written to him  because he guessed that you had tried in the
course of that literary morning to show him too much  too much
obvious attention

Artoff uttered the whole of this little speech in the same resonant but
firm voice in which men who are still very young answer at examinations
on questions for which they are well prepared He was indignant he
was angry And that wrath had loosed his tongue which was not very
fluent on ordinary occasions

She continued to advance along the path with somewhat lagging steps
Artoff followed her as before and as before saw only her little old
mantilla and her small hat which was not quite new either His vanity
suffered at the thought that she must now be thinking All I had to do
was to make a sign and he immediately hastened to me

Artoff lapsed into silence  he expected that she would reply to him
but she did not utter a word

I am ready to listen to you he began again and I shall even be very
glad if I can be of service to you in any way  although I must
confess nevertheless that I find it astonishing  that considering
my isolated life

But at his last words Clara suddenly turned to him and he beheld the
same startled profoundlysorrowful visage with the same large bright
tears in its eyes with the same woful expression around the parted
lips and the visage was so fine thus that he involuntarily broke off
short and felt within himself something akin to fright and pity and
forbearance

Akh why  why are you like this  she said with irresistibly
sincere and upright forceand what a touching ring there was to her
voiceIs it possible that my appeal to you can have offended you
Is it possible that you have understood nothing Ah yes You have
not understood anything you have not understood what I said to you God
knows what you have imagined about me you have not even reflected what
it cost me to write to you You have been anxious only on your own
account about your own dignity your own peace But did I she
so tightly clenched her hands which she had raised to her lips that her
fingers cracked audibly As though I had made any demands upon you
as though explanations were requisite to begin with My dear
madame I even find it astonishing If I can be of service to
you Akh how foolish I have beenI have been deceived in you in
your face When I saw you for the first time There There you
stand And not one word do you utter Have you really not a word to
say

She had been imploring Her face suddenly flushed and as suddenly
assumed an evil and audacious expressionO Lord how stupid this
isshe cried suddenly with a harsh laughHow stupid our tryst is
How stupid I am  and you too Fie

She made a disdainful gesture with her hand as though sweeping him out
of her path and passing around him she ran swiftly from the boulevard
and disappeared

That gesture of the hand that insulting laugh that final exclamation
instantly restored Artoff to his former frame of mind and stifled in
him the feeling which had risen in his soul when she turned to him with
tears in her eyes Again he waxed wroth and came near shouting after
the retreating girl You may turn out a good actress but why have you
taken it into your head to play a comedy on me

With great strides he returned home and although he continued to be
indignant and to rage all the way thither still at the same time
athwart all these evil hostile feelings there forced its way the memory
of that wondrous face which he had beheld only for the twinkling of an
eye He even put to himself the question Why did not I answer her
when she demanded from me at least one wordI did not have time
 he thought She did not give me a chance to utter that word
And what would I have uttered

But he immediately shook his head and said An actress

And yet at the same time the vanity of the inexperienced nervous
youth which had been wounded at first now felt rather flattered at
the passion which he had inspired

But on the other hand he pursued his reflections all that is at an
end of course I must have appeared ridiculous to her

This thought was disagreeable to him and again he grew angry  both
at her  and at himself On reaching home he locked himself in his
study He did not wish to encounter Platsha The kind old woman came to
his door a couple of times applied her ear to the keyhole and merely
sighed and whispered her prayer

It has begun she thought And he is only fiveandtwenty Akh
it is early early




VIII


Aktoff was very much out of sorts all the following day

What is the matter Ysha Platonda Ivnovna said to him Thou
seemest to be tousled today somehow In the old womans peculiar
language this quite accurately defined Artoffs moral condition He
could not work but even he himself did not know what he wanted Now he
was expecting Kupfer again he suspected that it was precisely from
Kupfer that Clara had obtained his address  and who else could have
talked a great deal about him again he wondered whether his
acquaintance with her was to end in that way  again he imagined that
she would write him another letter again he asked himself whether he
ought not to write her a letter in which he might explain everything to
heras he did not wish to leave an unpleasant impression of
himself But in point of fact what was he to explainNow he
aroused in himself something very like disgust for her for her
persistence her boldness again that indescribably touching face
presented itself to him and her irresistible voice made itself heard
and yet again he recalled her singing her recitationand did not know
whether he was right in his wholesale condemnationIn one word he was
a tousled man At last he became bored with all this and decided as the
saying is to take it upon himself and erase all that affair as it
undoubtedly was interfering with his avocations and disturbing his peace
of mindHe did not find it so easy to put his resolution into
effect More than a week elapsed before he got back again into his
ordinary rut Fortunately Kupfer did not present himself at all any
more than if he had not been in Moscow Not long before the affair
Artoff had begun to busy himself with painting for photographic ends
he devoted himself to this with redoubled zeal

Thus imperceptibly with a few relapses as the doctors express it
consisting for example in the fact that he once came very near going to
call on the Princess two weeks  three weeks passed  and Artoff
became once more the Artoff of old Only deep down under the surface
of his life something heavy and dark secretly accompanied him in all
his comings and goings Thus does a large fish which has just been
hooked but has not yet been drawn out swim along the bottom of a deep
river under the very boat wherein sits the fisherman with his stout rod
in hand

And lo one day as he was skimming over some not quite fresh numbers of
the Moscow News Artoff hit upon the following correspondence

With great sorrow wrote a certain local literary man from Kazn we
insert in our theatrical chronicle the news of the sudden death of our
gifted actress Clara Mlitch who had succeeded in the brief space of
her engagement in becoming the favourite of our discriminating public
Our sorrow is all the greater because Miss Mlitch herself put an end to
her young life which held so much of promise by means of poison And
this poisoning is all the more dreadful because the actress took the
poison on the stage itself They barely got her home where to
universal regret she died Rumours are current in the town to the
effect that unrequited love led her to that terrible deed

Artoff softly laid the newspaper on the table To all appearances he
remained perfectly composed  but something smote him simultaneously
in his breast and in his head and then slowly diffused itself through
all his members He rose to his feet stood for a while on one spot and
again seated himself and again perused the letter Then he rose once
more lay down on his bed and placing his hands under his head he
stared for a long time at the wall like one dazed Little by little that
wall seemed to recede  to vanish  and he beheld before him the
boulevard beneath grey skies and her in her black mantilla  then
her again on the platform  he even beheld himself by her sideThat
which had smitten him so forcibly in the breast at the first moment now
began to rise up  to rise up in his throat He tried to cough to
call some one but his voice failed him and to his own amazement tears
which he could not restrain gushed from his eyes What had evoked
those tears Pity Regret Or was it simply that his nerves had been
unable to withstand the sudden shock Surely she was nothing to him
Was not that the fact

But perhaps that is not true the thought suddenly occurred to him I
must find out But from whom From the PrincessNo from Kupfer 
from Kupfer But they say he is not in MoscowNever mind I must apply
to him first

With these ideas in his head Artoff hastily dressed himself summoned a
cab and dashed off to Kupfer




IX


He had not hoped to find him  but he did Kupfer actually had been
absent from Moscow for a time but had returned about a week previously
and was even preparing to call on Artoff again He welcomed him with
his customary cordiality and began to explain something to him  but
Artoff immediately interrupted him with the impatient question

Hast thou read itIs it true

Is what true replied the astounded Kupfer

About Clara Mlitch

Kupfers face expressed compassionYes yes brother it is true she
has poisoned herself It is such a misfortune

Artoff held his peace for a spaceBut hast thou also read it in the
newspaper he askedOr perhaps thou hast been to Kazn thyself

I have been to Kazn in fact the Princess and I conducted her
thither She went on the stage there and had great success Only I did
not remain there until the catastrophe I was in Yaroslvl

In Yaroslvl

Yes I escorted the Princess thither She has settled in Yaroslvl
now

But hast thou trustworthy information

The most trustworthy sort  at first hand I made acquaintance in
Kazn with her familyBut stay my dear fellow  this news seems to
agitate thee greatlyBut I remember that Clara did not please thee
that time Thou wert wrong She was a splendid girlonly her head She
had an ungovernable head I was greatly distressed about her

Artoff did not utter a word but dropped down on a chair and after
waiting a while he asked Kupfer to tell him  he hesitated

What asked Kupfer

Why  everything replied Artoff slowlyAbout her family for
instance  and so forth Everything thou knowest

But does that interest theeCertainly

Kupfer from whose face it was impossible to discern that he had
grieved so greatly over Clara began his tale

From his words Artoff learned that Clara Mlitchs real name had been
Katerna Milovdoff that her father now dead had been an official
teacher of drawing in Kazn had painted bad portraits and official
images and moreover had borne the reputation of being a drunkard and a
domestic tyrant  and a cultured man into the bargain Here
Kupfer laughed in a selfsatisfied manner by way of hinting at the pun
he had madethat he had left at his death in the first place a
widow of the merchant class a thoroughly stupid female straight out of
one of Ostrvskys comedies and in the second place a daughter
much older than Clara and bearing no resemblance to hera very clever
girl and greatly developed my dear fellow That the twowidow and
daughterlived in easy circumstances in a decent little house which
had been acquired by the sale of those wretched portraits and holy
pictures that Clara  or Ktya whichever you choose to call her had
astonished every one ever since her childhood by her talent but was of
an insubordinate capricious disposition and was constantly quarrelling
with her father that having an inborn passion for the theatre she had
run away from the parental house at the age of sixteen with an
actress

With an actor interjected Artoff

No not with an actor but an actress to whom she had become
attached This actress had a protector it is true a wealthy
gentleman already elderly who only refrained from marrying her because
he was already marriedwhile the actress it appeared was married
also

Further Kupfer informed Artoff that prior to her arrival in Moscow
Clara had acted and sung in provincial theatres that on losing her
friend the actress the gentleman had died also it seems or had made
it up with his wifeprecisely which Kupfer did not quite remember 
she had made the acquaintance of the Princess that woman of gold whom
thou my friend Ykoff Andritch the narrator added with feeling
wert not able to appreciate at her true worth that finally Clara had
been offered an engagement in Kazn and had accepted it although she
had previously declared that she would never leave MoscowBut how the
people of Kazn had loved herit was fairly amazing At every
representation she received bouquets and gifts bouquets and giftsA
flour merchant the greatest bigwig in the government had even
presented her with a golden inkstandKupfer narrated all this with
great animation but without however displaying any special
sentimentality and interrupting his speech with the questionWhy
dost thou want to know that  or To what end is that when
Artoff after listening to him with devouring attention demanded more
and still more details Everything was said at last and Kupfer ceased
speaking rewarding himself for his toil with a cigar

But why did she poison herself asked Artoff The newspaper
stated

Kupfer waved his handsWell That I cannot say I dont know
But the newspaper lies Clara behaved in an exemplary manner  she had
no loveaffairs And how could she with her pride She was as proud
as Satan himself and inaccessible An insubordinate head Firm as a
rock If thou wilt believe meI knew her pretty intimately seest
thouI never beheld a tear in her eyes

But I did thought Artoff to himself

Only there is this to be said went on KupferI noticed a great
change in her of late she became so depressed she would remain silent
for hours at a time you couldnt get a word out of her I once asked
her Has any one offended you Katerna Semynovna Because I knew her
disposition she could not endure an insult She held her peace and
that was the end of it Even her success on the stage did not cheer her
up they would shower her with bouquets  and she would not smile She
gave one glance at the gold inkstandand put it asideShe complained
that no one would write her a genuine part as she conceived it And she
gave up singing entirely I am to blame brother I repeated to her
that thou didst not think she had any school But nevertheless  why
she poisoned herself is incomprehensible And the way she did it
too

In what part did she have the greatest success Artoff wanted to
find out what part she had played that last time but for some reason or
other he asked something else

In Ostrvskys Grnya I believe But I repeat to thee she had no
loveaffairs Judge for thyself by one thing she lived in her mothers
house Thou knowest what some of those merchants houses are like a
glass case filled with holy images in every corner and a shrine lamp in
front of the case deadly stifling heat a sour odour in the
drawingroom nothing but chairs ranged along the wall and geraniums in
the windowsand when a visitor arrives the hostess begins to groan as
though an enemy were approaching What chance is there for lovemaking
and amours in such a place Sometimes it happened that they would not
even admit me Their maidservant a robust peasantwoman in a Turkey
red cotton sarafan and pendulous breasts would place herself
across the path in the anteroom and roar Whither away No I
positively cannot understand what made her poison herself She must have
grown tired of life Kupfer philosophically wound up his remarks

Artoff sat with drooping headCanst thou give me the address of
that house in Kazn he said at last

I can but what dost thou want of itDost thou wish to send a letter
thither

Perhaps so

Well as thou wilt Only the old woman will not answer thee Her sister
might  the clever sisterBut again brother I marvel at thee Such
indifference formerly  and now so much attention All that comes of
living a solitary life my dear fellow

Artoff made no reply to this remark and went away after having
procured the address in Kazn

Agitation surprise expectation had been depicted on his face when he
went to Kupfer Now he advanced with an even gait downcast eyes and
hat pulled low down over his brows almost every one he met followed him
with a searching gaze  but he paid no heed to the passersby  it
was quite different from what it had been on the boulevard

Unhappy Clara Foolish Clara resounded in his soul




X


Nevertheless Artoff passed the following day in a fairly tranquil
manner He was even able to devote himself to his customary occupations
There was only one thing both during his busy time and in his leisure
moments he thought incessantly of Clara of what Kupfer had told him the
day before Truth to tell his thoughts were also of a decidedly pacific
nature It seemed to him that that strange young girl interested him
from a psychological point of view as something in the nature of a
puzzle over whose solution it was worth while to cudgel ones
brainsShe ran away from home with a kept actress he thought she
placed herself under the protection of that Princess in whose house she
livedand had no loveaffairs It is improbable Kupfer says it was
pride But in the first place we know Artoff should have said we
have read in books  that pride is compatible with lightminded
conduct and in the second place did not she such a proud person
appoint a meeting with a man who might show her scorn  and appoint it
in a public place into the bargain  on the boulevardAt this
point there recurred to Artoffs mind the whole scene on the boulevard
and he asked himself Had he really shown scorn for ClaraNo he
decided That was another feeling  a feeling of perplexity  of
distrust in shortUnhappy Clara again rang through his
brainYes she was unhappy he decided again  that was the most
fitting word

But if that is so I was unjust She spoke truly when she said that I
did not understand her Tis a pityIt may be that a very remarkable
being has passed so close to me  and I did not take advantage of the
opportunity but repulsed her Well never mind My life is still
before me I shall probably have other encounters of a different sort

But what prompted her to pick out me in particularHe cast a
glance at a mirror which he was passing at the moment What is there
peculiar about me And what sort of a beauty am IMy face is like
everybody elses face However she was not a beauty either

She was not a beauty  but what an expressive face she had Impassive
 but expressive I have never before seen such a faceAnd she has
talent  that is to say she had talent undoubted talent Wild
untrained even coarse  but undoubtedAnd in that case also I was
unjust to herArtoff mentally transported himself to the musical
morning  and noticed that he remembered with remarkable distinctness
every word she had sung or recited every intonation That would not
have been the case had she been devoid of talent

And now all that is in the grave where she has thrust herself But
I have nothing to do with that I am not to blame It would even be
absurd to think that I am to blameAgain it flashed into Artoffs
mind that even had she had anything of that sort about her his
conduct during the interview would indubitably have disenchanted her
That was why she had broken into such harsh laughter at partingAnd
where was the proof that she had poisoned herself on account of an
unhappy love It is only newspaper correspondents who attribute every
such death to unhappy loveBut life easily becomes repulsive to people
with character like Clara  and tiresome Yes tiresome Kupfer was
right living simply bored her

In spite of her success of her ovationsArtoff meditatedThe
psychological analysis to which he surrendered himself was even
agreeable to him Unaccustomed as he had been up to this time to all
contact with women he did not suspect how significant for him was this
tense examination of a womans soul

Consequently he pursued his meditations art did not satisfy her
did not fill the void of her life Genuine artists exist only for art
for the theatre Everything else pales before that which they regard
as their vocation She was a dilettante

Here Artoff again became thoughtfulNo the word dilettante did not
consort with that face with the expression of that face of those
eyes

And again there rose up before him the image of Clara with her
tearfilled eyes riveted upon him and her clenched hands raised to her
lips

Akh I wont think of it I wont think of it  he whispered
What is the use

In this manner the whole day passed During dinner Artoff chatted a
great deal with Platsha questioned her about old times which by the
way she recalled and transmitted badly as she was not possessed of a
very glib tongue and had noticed hardly anything in the course of her
life save her Yshka She merely rejoiced that he was so goodnatured
and affectionate that dayToward evening Artoff quieted down to such
a degree that he played several games of trumps with his aunt

Thus passed the day  but the night was quite another matter




XI


It began well he promptly fell asleep and when his aunt entered his
room on tiptoe for the purpose of making the sign of the cross over him
thrice as he sleptshe did this every nighthe was lying and breathing
as quietly as a childBut before daybreak he had a vision

He dreamed that he was walking over the bare steppes sown with stones
beneath a lowhanging sky Between the stones wound a path he was
advancing along it

Suddenly there rose up in front of him something in the nature of a
delicate cloud He looked intently at it the little cloud turned into a
woman in a white gown with a bright girdle about her waist She was
hurrying away from him He did not see either her face or her hair  a
long piece of tissue concealed them But he felt bound to overtake her
and look into her eyes Only no matter how much haste he made she
still walked more quickly than he

On the path lay a broad flat stone resembling a tombstone It barred
her way The woman came to a halt Artoff ran up to her She turned
toward himbut still he could not see her eyes  they were closed
Her face was whitewhite as snow her arms hung motionless She
resembled a statue

Slowly without bending a single limb she leaned backward and sank down
on that stone And now Artoff was lying beside her outstretched
like a mortuary statueand his hands were folded like those of a
corpse

But at this point the woman suddenly rose to her feet and went away
Artoff tried to rise also  but he could not stir he could not
unclasp his hands and could only gaze after her in despair

Then the woman suddenly turned round and he beheld bright vivacious
eyes in a living face which was strange to him however She was
laughing beckoning to him with her hand  and still he was unable to
move

She laughed yet once again and swiftly retreated merrily nodding her
head on which a garland of tiny roses gleamed crimson

Artoff strove to shout strove to break that frightful nightmare
Suddenly everything grew dark round about  and the woman returned to
him

But she was no longer a statue whom he knew not  she was Clara She
halted in front of him folded her arms and gazed sternly and
attentively at him Her lips were tightly compressed but it seemed to
Artoff that he heard the words

If thou wishest to know who I am go thither

Whither he asked

Thitherthe moaning answer made itself audibleThither

Artoff awoke

He sat up in bed lighted a candle which stood on his nightstand but
did not rise and sat there for a long time slowly gazing about him It
seemed to him that something had taken place within him since he went to
bed that something had taken root within him  something had taken
possession of him But can that be possible he whispered
unconsciously Can it be that such a power exists

He could not remain in bed He softly dressed himself and paced his
chamber until daylight And strange to say He did not think about Clara
for a single minuteand he did not think about her because he had made
up his mind to set off for Kazn that very day

He thought only of that journey of how it was to be made and what he
ought to take with himand how he would there ferret out and find out
everythingand regain his composure

If thou dost not go he argued with himself thou wilt surely lose
thy reason He was afraid of that he was afraid of his nerves He was
convinced that as soon as he should see all that with his own eyes all
obsessions would flee like a nocturnal nightmareAnd the journey will
occupy not more than a week in all he thought What is a week And
there is no other way of ridding myself of it

The rising sun illuminated his room but the light of day did not
disperse the shades of night which weighed upon him did not alter his
decision

Platsha came near having an apoplectic stroke when he communicated his
decision to her She even squatted down on her heels  her legs gave
way under her To Kazn Why to Kazn she whispered protruding her
eyes which were already blind enough without that She would not have
been any more astounded had she learned that her Ysha was going to
marry the neighbouring bakers daughter or depart to AmericaAnd
shalt thou stay long in Kazn

I shall return at the end of a week replied Artoff as he stood
halfturned away from his aunt who was still sitting on the floor

Platsha tried to remonstrate again but Artoff shouted at her in an
utterly unexpected and unusual manner

I am not a baby he yelled turning pale all over while his lips
quivered and his eyes flashed viciouslyI am sixandtwenty years of
age I know what I am aboutI am free to do as I pleaseI will not
permit any one Give me money for the journey prepare a trunk with
linen and clothing  and do not bother me I shall return at the end
of a week Platsha he added in a softer tone

Platsha rose to her feet grunting and making no further opposition
wended her way to her chamber Ysha had frightened herI have not a
head on my shoulders she remarked to the cook who was helping her to
pack Yshas thingsnot a headbut a beehive  and what bees are
buzzing there I do not know He is going away to Kazn my mother to
Kazn

The cook who had noticed their yardporter talking for a long time to
the policeman about something wanted to report this circumstance to her
mistress but she did not dare and merely thought to herself To
Kazn If only it isnt some place further awayAnd Platonda
Ivnovna was so distracted that she did not even utter her customary
prayerIn such a catastrophe as this even the Lord God could be of no
assistance

That same day Artoff set off for Kazn




XII


No sooner had he arrived in that town and engaged a room at the hotel
than he dashed off in search of the widow Milovdoffs house During the
whole course of his journey he had been in a sort of stupor which
nevertheless did not in the least prevent his taking all proper
measurestransferring himself at Nizhni Nvgorod from the railway to
the steamer eating at the stations and so forth As before he was
convinced that everything would be cleared up there and accordingly
he banished from his thoughts all memories and speculations contenting
himself with one thingthe mental preparation of the speech in which
he was to set forth to Clara Mlitchs family the real reason of his
tripAnd now at last he had attained to the goal of his yearning
and ordered the servant to announce him He was admittedwith surprise
and alarmbut he was admitted

The widow Milovdoffs house proved to be in fact just as Kupfer had
described it and the widow herself really did resemble one of
Ostrvskys women of the merchant class although she was of official
rank her husband had been a Collegiate Assessor Not without some
difficulty did Artoff after having preliminarily excused himself for
his boldness and the strangeness of his visit make the speech which he
had prepared to the effect that he wished to collect all the necessary
information concerning the gifted actress who had perished at such an
early age that he was actuated not by idle curiosity but by a profound
sympathy for her talent of which he was a worshipper he said exactly
thata worshipper that in conclusion it would be a sin to leave
the public in ignorance of the loss it had sustainedand why its hopes
had not been realized

Madame Milovdoff did not interrupt Artoff it is hardly probable that
she understood very clearly what this strange visitor was saying to her
and she merely swelled a little with pride and opened her eyes widely
at him on perceiving that he had a peaceable aspect and was decently
clad and was not some sort of swindler  and was not asking for any
money

Are you saying that about Ktya she asked as soon as Artoff ceased
speaking

Exactly so  about your daughter

And you have come from Moscow for that purpose

Yes from Moscow

Merely for that

Merely for that

Madame Milovdoff suddenly took frightWhy youare an author Do
you write in the newspapers

No I am not an authorand up to the present time I have never
written for the newspapers

The widow bent her head She was perplexed

Consequently  it is for your own pleasure she suddenly inquired
Artoff did not immediately hit upon the proper answer

Out of sympathy out of reverence for talent he said at last

The word reverence pleased Madame Milovdoff Very well she
ejaculated with a sigh Although I am her mother and grieved very
greatly over her It was such a catastrophe you know Still I
must say that she was always a crazy sort of girl and ended up in the
same way Such a disgrace Judge for yourself what sort of a thing
is that for a mother We may be thankful that they even buried her in
Christian fashion Madame Milovdoff crossed herselfFrom the
time she was a small child she submitted to no oneshe abandoned the
paternal roof  and finally it is enough to say that she became an
actress Every one knows that I did not turn her out of the house for I
loved her For I am her mother all the same She did not have to live
with strangersand beg alms Here the widow melted into
tearsBut if you sir she began afresh wiping her eyes with the
ends of her kerchief really have that intention and if you will not
concoct anything dishonourable about usbut if on the contrary you
wish to show us a favourthen you had better talk with my other
daughter She will tell you everything better than I can
nnotchka called Madame Milovdoffnnotchka come hither Theres
some gentleman or other from Moscow who wants to talk about Ktya

There was a crash in the adjoining room but no one
appearednnotchka cried the widow againAnna Semynovna come
hither I tell thee

The door opened softly and on the threshold appeared a girl no longer
young of sickly aspect and homely but with very gentle and sorrowful
eyes Artoff rose from his seat to greet her and introduced himself
at the same time mentioning his friend KupferAh Fedor
Fedoritch ejaculated the girl softly as she softly sank down on a
chair

Come now talk with the gentleman said Madame Milovdoff rising
ponderously from her seat He has taken the trouble to come expressly
from Moscowhe wishes to collect information about Ktya But you must
excuse me sir she added turning to Artoff I shall go away to
attend to domestic affairs You can have a good explanation with
nnotchkashe will tell you about the theatre  and all that sort of
thing Shes my clever welleducated girl she speaks French and reads
books quite equal to her dead sister And she educated her sister I may
say She was the elderwell and so she taught her

Madame Milovdoff withdrew When Artoff was left alone with Anna
Semynovna he repeated his speech but from the first glance he
understood that he had to deal with a girl who really was cultured not
with a merchants daughterand so he enlarged somewhat and employed
different expressionsand toward the end he became agitated flushed
and felt conscious that his heart was beating hard Anna Semynovna
listened to him in silence with her hands folded the sad smile did not
leave her face  bitter woe which had not ceased to cause pain was
expressed in that smile

Did you know my sister she asked Artoff

No properly speaking I did not know her he replied I saw and
heard your sister once  but all that was needed was to hear and see
your sister once in order to

Do you mean to write her biography Anna put another question

Artoff had not expected that word nevertheless he immediately
answered Why not But the chief point was that he wished to acquaint
the public

Anna stopped him with a gesture of her hand

To what end The public caused her much grief without that and Ktya
had only just begun to live But if you yourself Anna looked at him
and again smiled that same sad smile only now it was more cordial 
apparently she was thinking Yes thou dost inspire me with
confidence  if you yourself cherish such sympathy for her then
permit me to request that you come to us this evening  after dinner
I cannot now  so suddenly I will collect my forces I will
make an effort Akh I loved her too greatly

Anna turned away she was on the point of bursting into sobs

Artoff rose alertly from his chair thanked her for her proposal said
that he would come without fail  without fail and went away bearing
in his soul an impression of a quiet voice of gentle and sorrowful
eyesand burning with the languor of anticipation




XIII


Artoff returned to the Milovdoffs house that same day and conversed
for three whole hours with Anna Semynovna Madame Milovdoff went to
bed immediately after dinnerat two oclockand rested until evening
tea at seven oclock Artoffs conversation with Claras sister was
not properly speaking a conversation she did almost the whole of the
talking at first with hesitation with confusion but afterward with
uncontrollable fervour She had evidently idolised her sister The
confidence wherewith Artoff had inspired her waxed and strengthened
she was no longer embarrassed she even fell to weeping softly twice
in his presence He seemed to her worthy of her frank revelations and
effusions Nothing of that sort had ever before come into her own dull
life And he  he drank in her every word

This then is what he learned  much of it as a matter of course
from what she refrained from saying  and much he filled out for
himself

In her youth Clara had been without doubt a disagreeable child and as
a young girl she had been only a little softer selfwilled
hottempered vain she had not got on particularly well with her
father whom she despised for his drunkenness and incapacity He was
conscious of this and did not pardon it in her Her musical faculties
showed themselves at an early age her father repressed them
recognising painting as the sole artwherein he himself had had so
little success but which had nourished him and his family Clara had
loved her mother  in a careless way as she would have loved a nurse
she worshipped her sister although she squabbled with her and bit
her It is true that afterward she had been wont to go down on her
knees before her and kiss the bitten places She was all fire all
passion and all contradiction vengeful and kindhearted magnanimous
and rancorous she believed in Fate and did not believe in God these
words Anna whispered with terror she loved everything that was
beautiful and dressed herself at haphazard she could not endure to
have young men pay court to her but in books she read only those pages
where love was the theme she did not care to please she did not like
petting and never forgot caresses as she never forgot offences she was
afraid of death and she had killed herself She had been wont to say
sometimes I do not meet the sort of man I wantand the others I will
not haveWell and what if you should meet the right sort Anna had
asked herIf I do  I shall take himBut what if he will not
give himselfWell then  I will make an end of myself It will
mean that I am good for nothing

Claras father  he sometimes asked his wife when he was drunk Who
was the father of that blackvisaged little devil of thineI was
notClaras father in the endeavour to get her off his hands as
promptly as possible undertook to betroth her to a wealthy young
merchant a very stupid fellowone of the cultured sort Two weeks
before the wedding she was only sixteen years of age she walked up to
her betrothed folded her arms and drumming with her fingers on her
elbows her favourite pose she suddenly dealt him a blow bang on his
rosy cheek with her big strong hand He sprang to his feet and merely
gaspedit must be stated that he was dead in love with her He
asked What is that for She laughed and left the roomI was
present in the room narrated Anna and was a witness I ran after her
and said to her Good gracious Ktya why didst thou do thatBut
she answered me If he were a real man he would have thrashed me but
as it is he is a wet hen And he asks what it is for to boot If he
loved me and did not avenge himself then let him bear it and not ask
what is that for Hell never get anything of me unto ages of ages
And so she did not marry him Soon afterward she made the acquaintance
of that actress and left our house My mother wept but my father only
said Away with the refractory goat from the flock and would take no
trouble or try to hunt her up Father did not understand Clara On the
eve of her flight added Anna she almost strangled me in her embrace
and kept repeating I cannot I cannot do otherwise My heart may
break in two but I cannot our cage is too small  it is not large
enough for my wings And one cannot escape his fate

After that remarked Anna we rarely saw each other When father
died she came to us for a couple of days took nothing from the
inheritance and again disappeared She found it oppressive with us
I saw that Then she returned to Kazn as an actress

Artoff began to interrogate Anna concerning the theatre the parts in
which Clara had appeared her success Anna answered in detail but
with the same sad although animated enthusiasm She even showed Artoff
a photographic portrait which represented Clara in the costume of one
of her parts In the portrait she was looking to one side as though
turning away from the spectators the ribbon intertwined with her thick
hair fell like a serpent on her bare arm Artoff gazed long at that
portrait thought it a good likeness inquired whether Clara had not
taken part in public readings and learned that she had not that she
required the excitement of the theatre of the stage  but another
question was burning on his lips

Anna Semynovna he exclaimed at last not loudly but with peculiar
force tell me I entreat you why she  why she made up her mind to
that frightful step

Anna dropped her eyesI do not know she said after the lapse of
several minutesGod is my witness I do not know she continued
impetuously perceiving that Artoff had flung his hands apart as though
he did not believe her From the very time she arrived here she
seemed to be thoughtful gloomy Something must infallibly have happened
to her in Moscow which I was not able to divine But on the contrary
on that fatal day she seemed  if not more cheerful at any rate more
tranquil than usual I did not even have any forebodings added Anna
with a bitter smile as though reproaching herself for that

You see she began again it seemed to have been written in Ktyas
fate that she should be unhappy She was convinced of it herself from
her early youth She would prop her head on her hand meditate and say
I shall not live long She had forebodings Just imagine she even saw
beforehandsometimes in a dream sometimes in ordinary wisewhat was
going to happen to her I cannot live as I wish so I will not live at
all  was her adageOur life is in our own hands you know And
she proved it

Anna covered her face with her hands and ceased speaking

Anna Semynovna began Artoff after waiting a little perhaps you
have heard to what the newspapers attributed

To unhappy love interrupted Anna removing her hands from her face
with a jerk That is a calumny a calumny a lie My unsullied
unapproachable Ktya  Ktya  and an unhappy rejected love And
would not I have known about that Everybody everybody fell in love
with her  but she And whom could she have fallen in love with
here Who out of all these men was worthy of her Who had attained to
that ideal of honour uprightness puritymost of all puritywhich
she constantly held before her in spite of all her defects Reject
her  her

Annas voice broke Her fingers trembled slightly Suddenly she
flushed scarlet all over  flushed with indignation and at that
momentand only at that momentdid she resemble her sister

Artoff attempted to apologise

Listen broke in Anna once moreI insist upon it that you shall not
believe that calumny yourself and that you shall dissipate it if
possible Here you wish to write an article about her or something of
that sorthere is an opportunity for you to defend her memory That is
why I am talking so frankly with you Listen Ktya left a diary

Artoff startedA diary he whispered

Yes a diary  that is to say a few pages onlyKtya was not fond
of writing  for whole months together she did not write at all 
and her letters were so short But she was always always truthful she
never lied Lie forsooth with her vanity I  I will show you
that diary You shall see for yourself whether it contains a single hint
of any such unhappy love

Anna hastily drew from the tabledrawer a thin copybook about ten
pages in length no more and offered it to Artoff The latter grasped
it eagerly recognised the irregular bold handwritingthe handwriting
of that anonymous letteropened it at random and began at the
following lines

     MoscowTuesday  June I sang and recited at a literary
     morning Today is a significant day for me It must decide my
     fate These words were doubly underlined Once more I have
     seen Here followed several lines which had been carefully
     blotted outAnd then No no no I must return to my former
     idea if only

Artoff dropped the hand in which he held the book and his head sank
quietly on his breast

Read cried AnnaWhy dont you read Read from the beginning
You can read the whole of it in five minutes though this diary extends
over two whole years In Kazn she wrote nothing

Artoff slowly rose from his chair and fairly crashed down on his knees
before Anna

She was simply petrified with amazement and terror

Give  give me this diary said Artoff in a fainting voiceGive
it to me  and the photograph  you must certainly have anotherbut
I will return the diary to you But I must I must

In his entreaty in the distorted features of his face there was
something so despairing that it even resembled wrath suffering And
in reality he was suffering It seemed as though he had not been able to
foresee that such a calamity would descend upon him and was excitedly
begging to be spared to be saved

Give it to me he repeated

But  you  you were not in love with my sister said Anna at
last

Artoff continued to kneel

I saw her twice in all  believe me and if I had not been
impelled by causes which I myself cannot clearly either understand or
explain  if some power that is stronger than I were not upon me I
would not have asked you I would not have come hither I must 
I ought  why you said yourself that I was bound to restore her
image

And you were not in love with my sister asked Anna for the second
time

Artoff did not reply at once and turned away slightly as though with
pain

Well yes I was I wasAnd I am in love with her now he
exclaimed with the same desperation as before

Footsteps became audible in the adjoining room

Rise  rise  said Anna hastily My mother is coming

Artoff rose

And take the diary and the picture God be with youPoor poor
Ktya But you must return the diary to me she added with
animationAnd if you write anything you must be sure to send it to
me Do you hear

The appearance of Madame Milovdoff released Artoff from the necessity
of replyingHe succeeded nevertheless in whisperingYou are an
angel Thanks I will send all that I write

Madame Milovdoff was too drowsy to divine anything And so Artoff left
Kazn with the photographic portrait in the sidepocket of his coat He
had returned the copybook to Anna but without her having detected it
he had cut out the page on which stood the underlined words

On his way back to Moscow he was again seized with a sort of stupor
Although he secretly rejoiced that he had got what he went for yet he
repelled all thoughts of Clara until he should reach home again He
meditated a great deal more about her sister AnnaHere now he said
to himself is a wonderful sympathetic being What a delicate
comprehension of everything what a loving heart what absence of
egoism And how comes it that such girls bloom with us and in the
provincesand in such surroundings into the bargain She is both
sickly and illfavoured and not youngbut what a capital wife she
would make for an honest welleducated man That is the person with
whom one ought to fall in love Artoff meditated thus  but on
his arrival in Moscow the matter took quite another turn




XIV


Platonda Ivnova was unspeakably delighted at the return of her nephew
She had thought all sorts of things during his absenceAt the very
least he has gone to Siberia she whispered as she sat motionless in
her little chamber for a year at the very leastMoreover the cook
had frightened her by imparting the most authentic news concerning the
disappearance of first one then another young man from the
neighbourhood Yshas complete innocence and trustworthiness did not in
the least serve to calm the old womanBecause  much that
signifieshe busies himself with photography  well and that is
enough Seize him And now here was her Yshenka come back to her safe
and sound She did notice it is true that he appeared to have grown
thin and his face seemed to be sunkenthat was comprehensible  he
had had no one to look after him But she did not dare to question him
concerning his trip At dinner she inquired

And is Kazn a nice town

Yes replied Artoff

Tatrs live there I believe

Not Tatrs only

And hast not thou brought a khalt thence

No I have not

And there the conversation ended

But as soon as Artoff found himself alone in his study he immediately
felt as though something were embracing him round about as though he
were again in the powerprecisely that in the power of another
life of another being Although he had told Annain that outburst of
sudden frenzythat he was in love with Clara that word now seemed to
him devoid of sense and whimsicalNo he was not in love and how
could he fall in love with a dead woman whom even during her lifetime
he had not liked whom he had almost forgottenNo But he was in the
power of  in her power  he no longer belonged to himself He had
been taken possession of Taken possession of to such a point that he
was no longer trying to free himself either by ridiculing his own
stupidity or by arousing in himself if not confidence at least hope
that all this would pass over that it was nothing but nervesor by
seeking proofs of itor in any other wayIf I meet him I shall take
him he recalled Claras words reported by Anna  and so now he had
been taken

But was not she dead Yes her body was dead  but how about her
soulWas not that immortal  did it require bodily organs to
manifest its power Magnetism has demonstrated to us the influence of
the living human soul upon another living human soul Why should not
that influence be continued after death if the soul remains aliveBut
with what object What might be the result of thisBut do we in
general realise the object of everything which goes on around us

These reflections occupied Artoff to such a degree that at tea he
suddenly asked Platsha whether she believed in the immortality of the
soul She did not understand at first what it was he had asked but
afterward she crossed herself and replied of course How could the
soul be otherwise than immortal

But if that is so can it act after death Artoff put a second
question

The old woman replied that it could  that is to say it can pray for
us when it shall have passed through all sorts of tribulations and is
awaiting the Last Judgment But during the first forty days it only
hovers around the spot where its death occurred

During the first forty days

Yes and after that come its tribulations

Artoff was surprised at his aunts erudition and went off to his own
roomAnd again he felt the same thing that same power upon him The
power was manifested thusthat the image of Clara incessantly presented
itself to him in its most minute detailsdetails which he did not
seem to have observed during her lifetime he saw  he saw her
fingers her nails the bands of hair on her cheeks below her temples a
small mole under the left eye he saw the movement of her lips her
nostrils her eyebrows  and what sort of a gait she had and how she
held her head a little on the right side  he saw everythingHe did
not admire all this at all he simply could not help thinking about it
and seeing itYet he did not dream about her during the first night
after his return  he was very weary and slept like one slain On the
other hand no sooner did he awake than she again entered his room and
there she remained as though she had been its owner just as though she
had purchased for herself that right by her voluntary death without
asking him or requiring his permission

He took her photograph he began to reproduce it to enlarge it Then it
occurred to him to arrange it for the stereoscope It cost him a great
deal of trouble but at last he succeeded He fairly started when he
beheld through the glass her figure which had acquired the semblance of
bodily substance But that figure was grey as though covered with
dust  and moreover the eyes  the eyes still gazed aside as
though they were averting themselves He began to gaze at them for a
long long time as though expecting that they might at any moment
turn themselves in his direction  he even puckered up his eyes
deliberately  but the eyes remained motionless and the whole figure
assumed the aspect of a doll He went away threw himself into an
armchair got out the leaf which he had torn from her diary with the
underlined words and thought They say that people in love kiss the
lines which have been written by a beloved hand but I have no desire to
do thatand the chirography appears to me ugly into the bargain But in
that line lies my condemnationAt this point there flashed into his
mind the promise he had made to Anna about the article He seated
himself at his table and set about writing it but everything he wrote
turned out so rhetorical  worst of all so artificial  just as
though he did not believe in what he was writing or in his own feelings
 and Clara herself seemed to him unrecognisable incomprehensible
She would not yield herself to him

No he thought throwing aside his pen either I have no talent for
writing in general or I must wait a while yet

He began to call to mind his visit to the Milovdoffs and all the
narration of Anna of that kind splendid Anna The word she had
uttered unsullied suddenly struck him It was exactly as though
something had scorched and illuminated him

Yes he said aloud she was unsullied and I am unsullied That is
what has given her this power

Thoughts concerning the immortality of the soul the life beyond the
grave again visited him Is it not said in the Bible O death where
is thy sting And in Schiller And the dead also shall live Auch
die Todten sollen lebenOr here again in Mickiewicz I shall love
until life ends  and after life endsWhile one English writer has
said Love is stronger than deathThe biblical sentence acted with
peculiar force on Artoff He wanted to look up the place where those
words were to be found He had no Bible he went to borrow one from
Platsha She was astonished but she got out an old old book in a
warped leather binding with brass clasps all spotted with wax and
handed it to Artoff He carried it off to his own room but for a long
time could not find that verse  but on the other hand he hit upon
another

     Greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life
     for his friends the Gospel of John Chap XV verse 

He thought That is not properly expressedIt should read Greater
power hath no man

But what if she did not set her soul on me at all What if she killed
herself merely because life had become a burden to herWhat if she in
conclusion did not come to that tryst with the object of obtaining
declarations of love at all

But at that moment Clara before her parting on the boulevard rose up
before him He recalled that sorrowful expression on her face and
those tears and those wordsAkh you have understood nothing

No He could not doubt for what object and for what person she had laid
down her life

Thus passed that day until nightfall




XV


Artoff went early to bed without feeling particularly sleepy but he
hoped to find rest in bed The strained condition of his nerves caused
him a fatigue which was far more intolerable than the physical weariness
of the journey and the road But great as was his fatigue he could not
get to sleep He tried to read  but the lines got entangled before
his eyes He extinguished his candle and darkness took possession of
his chamberBut he continued to lie there sleepless with closed
eyes And now it seemed to him that some one was whispering in his
ear It is the beating of my heart the rippling of the blood he
thought But the whisper passed into coherent speech Some one was
talking Russian hurriedly plaintively and incomprehensibly It was
impossible to distinguish a single separate word But it was Claras
voice

Artoff opened his eyes rose up in bed propped himself on his
elbows The voice grew fainter but continued its plaintive hurried
unintelligible speech as before

It was indubitably Claras voice

Some ones fingers ran over the keys of the piano in light arpeggios
Then the voice began to speak again More prolonged sounds made
themselves audible  like moans  always the same And then words
began to detach themselves

Roses  roses  roses

Roses repeated Artoff in a whisper

Akh yes The roses which I saw on the head of that woman in my
dream

Roses was audible again

Is it thou asked Artoff whispering as before

The voice suddenly ceased

Artoff waited  waitedand dropped his head on his pillow A
hallucination of hearing he thought Well and what if  what if
she really is here close to me What if I were to see her would I
be frightened But why should I be frightened Why should I rejoice
Possibly because it would be a proof that there is another world that
the soul is immortalBut however even if I were to see anything
that also might be a hallucination of the sight

Nevertheless he lighted his candle and shot a glance over the whole
room not without some trepidation  and descried nothing unusual in
it He rose approached the stereoscope  and there again was the same
grey doll with eyes which gazed to one side The feeling of alarm in
Artoff was replaced by one of vexation He had been as it were
deceived in his expectations  and those same expectations appeared to
him absurdWell this is downright stupid he muttered as he got
back into bed and blew out his light Again profound darkness reigned
in the room

Artoff made up his mind to go to sleep this time But a new
sensation had cropped up within him It seemed to him as though some one
were standing in the middle of the room not far from him and breathing
in a barely perceptible manner He hastily turned round opened his
eyes But what could be seen in that impenetrable darknessHe began
to fumble for a match on his nightstand  and suddenly it seemed to
him as though some soft noiseless whirlwind dashed across the whole
room above him through himand the words Tis I rang plainly in
his ears Tis I Tis I

Several moments passed before he succeeded in lighting a match

Again there was no one in the room and he no longer heard anything
except the violent beating of his own heart He drank a glass of water
and remained motionless with his head resting on his hand

He said to himself I will wait Either this is all nonsense  or she
is here She will not play with me like a cat with a mouse He waited
waited a long time  so long that the hand on which he was propping
his head became numb  but not a single one of his previous sensations
was repeated A couple of times his eyes closed He immediately
opened them  at least it seemed to him that he opened them
Gradually they became riveted on the door and so remained The candle
burned out and the room became dark once more  but the door gleamed
like a long white spot in the midst of the gloom And lo that spot
began to move it contracted vanished  and in its place on the
threshold a female form made its appearance Artoff looked at it
intently  it was Clara And this time she was gazing straight at him
she moved toward him On her head was a wreath of red roses It
kept undulating rising

Before him stood his aunt in her nightcap with a broad red ribbon and
in a white wrapper

Platsha he enunciated with difficultyIs it you

It is I replied Platonda Ivnovna It is I Yashynotchek it is
I

Why have you come

Why thou didst wake me At first thou seemedst to be moaning all the
while  and then suddenly thou didst begin to shout Save me Help
me

I shouted

Yes thou didst shout and so hoarsely Save meI thought O Lord
Can he be ill So I entered Art thou well

Perfectly well

Come that means that thou hast had a bad dream I will fumigate with
incense if thou wishestshall I

Again Artoff gazed intently at his aunt and burst into a loud
laugh The figure of the kind old woman in nightcap and wrapper with
her frightened longdrawn face really was extremely comical All that
mysterious something which had surrounded him had stifled him all
those delusions dispersed on the instant

No Platsha my dear it is not necessary he saidForgive me for
having involuntarily alarmed you May your rest be tranquiland I will
go to sleep also

Platonda Ivnovna stood a little while longer on the spot where she
was pointed at the candle grumbled Why dost thou not extinguish
it  there will be a catastrophe before longand as she retired
could not refrain from making the sign of the cross over him from afar

Artoff fell asleep immediately and slept until morning He rose in a
fine frame of mind  although he regretted something He felt
light and free What romantic fancies one does devise he said to
himself with a smile He did not once glance either at the stereoscope
or the leaf which he had torn out But immediately after breakfast he
set off to see Kupfer

What drew him thither  he dimly recognised




XVI


Artoff found his sanguine friend at home He chatted a little with him
reproached him for having quite forgotten him and his aunt listened to
fresh laudations of the golden woman the Princess from whom Kupfer had
just receivedfrom Yaroslvla skullcap embroidered with
fishscales  and then suddenly sitting down in front of Kupfer and
looking him straight in the eye he announced that he had been to Kazn

Thou hast been to Kazn Why so

Why because I wished to collect information about that  Clara
Mlitch

The girl who poisoned herself

Yes

Kupfer shook his headWhat a fellow thou art And such a sly one
Thou hast travelled a thousand versts there and back  and all for
what Hey If there had only been some feminine interest there Then I
could understand everything every sort of follyKupfer ruffled up
his hairBut for the sake of collecting materials as you learned men
put it No I thank you Thats what the committee of statistics
exists forWell and what about itdidst thou make acquaintance with
the old woman and with her sister Shes a splendid girl isnt she

Splendid assented ArtoffShe communicated to me many curious
things

Did she tell thee precisely how Clara poisoned herself

Thou meanest  what dost thou mean

Why in what manner

No She was still in such affliction I did not dare to question
her too much But was there anything peculiar about it

Of course there was Just imagine she was to have acted that very
dayand she did act She took a phial of poison with her to the
theatre drank it before the first act and in that condition played
through the whole of that act With the poison inside her What dost
thou think of that strength of will What character wasnt it And they
say that she never sustained her role with so much feeling with so much
warmth The audience suspected nothing applauded recalled her But
as soon as the curtain fell she dropped down where she stood on the
stage She began to writhe  and writhe  and at the end of an hour
her spirit fled But is it possible I did not tell thee that It was
mentioned in the newspapers also

Artoffs hands suddenly turned cold and his chest began to heave No
thou didst not tell me that he said at lastAnd dost thou not know
what the piece was

Kupfer meditatedI was told the name of the piece  a young girl
who has been betrayed appears in it It must be some drama or other
Clara was born for dramatic parts Her very appearance But where art
thou going Kupfer interrupted himself perceiving that Artoff was
picking up his cap

I do not feel quite well replied Artoff Goodbye I will drop
in some other time

Kupfer held him back and looked him in the faceWhat a nervous fellow
thou art brother Just look at thyself Thou hast turned as white as
clay

I do not feel well repeated Artoff freeing himself from Kupfers
hands and going his way Only at that moment did it become clear to him
that he had gone to Kupfer with the sole object of talking about
Clara

About foolish about unhappy Clara

But on reaching home he speedily recovered his composure to a certain
extent

The circumstances which had attended Claras death at first exerted a
shattering impression upon him  but later on that acting with the
poison inside her as Kupfer had expressed it seemed to him a
monstrous phrase a piece of bravado and he tried not to think of it
fearing to arouse within himself a feeling akin to aversion But at
dinner as he sat opposite Platsha he suddenly remembered her
nocturnal apparition recalled that bobtailed wrapper that cap with
the tall ribbon and why should there be a ribbon on a nightcap the
whole of that ridiculous figure at which all his visions had dispersed
into dust as though at the whistle of the machinist in a fantastic
ballet He even made Platsha repeat the tale of how she had heard him
shout had taken fright had leaped out of bed had not been able at
once to find either her own door or his and so forth In the evening he
played cards with her and went off to his own room in a somewhat sad but
fairly tranquil state of mind

Artoff did not think about the coming night and did not fear it he
was convinced that he should pass it in the best possible manner The
thought of Clara awoke in him from time to time but he immediately
remembered that she had killed herself in a spectacular manner and
turned away That outrageous act prevented other memories from rising
in him Giving a cursory glance at the stereoscope it seemed to him that
she was looking to one side because she felt ashamed Directly over the
stereoscope on the wall hung the portrait of his mother Artoff
removed it from its nail kissed it and carefully put it away in a
drawer Why did he do this Because that portrait must not remain in the
vicinity of that woman  or for some other reasonArtoff did not
quite know But his mothers portrait evoked in him memories of his
father  of that father whom he had seen dying in that same room on
that very bed What dost thou think about all this father he
mentally addressed him Thou didst understand all this thou didst also
believe in Schillers world of spiritsGive me counsel

My father has given me counsel to drop all these follies said Artoff
aloud and took up a book But he was not able to read long and feeling
a certain heaviness all through his body he went to bed earlier than
usual in the firm conviction that he should fall asleep immediately

And so it came about  but his hopes for a peaceful night were not
realised




XVII


Before the clock struck midnight he had a remarkable a menacing dream

It seemed to him that he was in a sumptuous countryhouse of which he
was the owner He had recently purchased the house and all the estates
attached to it And he kept thinking It is well now it is well but
disaster is coming Beside him was hovering a tiny little man his
manager this man kept making obeisances and trying to demonstrate to
Artoff how admirably everything about his house and estate was
arrangedPlease please look he kept reiterating grinning at every
word how everything is flourishing about you Here are horses  what
magnificent horses And Artoff saw a row of huge horses They were
standing with their backs to him in stalls they had wonderful manes
and tails  but as soon as Artoff walked past them the horses turned
their heads toward him and viciously displayed their teeth

It is well thought Artoff but disaster is coming

Please please repeated his manager again please come into the
garden see what splendid apples we have

The apples really were splendid red and round but as soon as Artoff
looked at them they began to shrivel and fall Disaster is coming
he thought

And here is the lake murmurs the manager how blue and smooth it is
And here is a little golden boat Would you like to have a sail in
it It moves of itself

I will not get into it thought Artoff a disaster is coming and
nevertheless he did seat himself in the boat On the bottom writhing
lay a little creature resembling an ape in its paws it was holding a
phial filled with a dark liquid

Pray do not feel alarmed shouted the manager from the shore That
is nothing That is death A prosperous journey

The boat darted swiftly onward  but suddenly a hurricane arose not
like the one of the day before soft and noiselessno it is a black
terrible howling hurricaneEverything is in confusion round
aboutand amid the swirling gloom Artoff beholds Clara in theatrical
costume she is raising the phial to her lips a distant Bravo bravo
is audible and a coarse voice shouts in Artoffs ear

Ah And didst thou think that all this would end in a comedyNo it
is a tragedy a tragedy

Artoff awoke all in a tremble It was not dark in the room A faint
and melancholy light streamed from somewhere or other impassively
illuminating all objects Artoff did not try to account to himself for
the light He felt but one thing Clara was there in that room  he
felt her presence  he was again and forever in her power

A shriek burst from his lips Clara art thou here

Yes rang out clearly in the middle of the room illuminated with the
motionless light

Artoff doubly repeated his question

Yes was audible once more

Then I want to see thee he cried springing out of bed

For several moments he stood in one spot treading the cold floor with
his bare feet His eyes roved But where Where whispered his
lips

Nothing was to be seen or heard

He looked about him and noticed that the faint light which filled the
room proceeded from a nightlight screened by a sheet of paper and
placed in one corner probably by Platsha while he was asleep He even
detected the odour of incense also in all probability the work of her
hands

He hastily dressed himself Remaining in bed sleeping was not to be
thought ofThen he took up his stand in the centre of the room and
folded his arms The consciousness of Claras presence was stronger than
ever within him

And now he began to speak in a voice which was not loud but with the
solemn deliberation wherewith exorcisms are uttered

Clarathus did he beginif thou art really here if thou seest
me if thou hearest me reveal thyself If that power which I feel
upon me is really thy powerreveal thyself If thou understandest how
bitterly I repent of not having understood thee of having repulsed
theereveal thyselfIf that which I have heard is really thy voice
if the feeling which has taken possession of me is love if thou art now
convinced that I love theeI who up to this time have not loved and
have not known a single womanif thou knowest that after thy death I
fell passionately irresistibly in love with thee if thou dost not wish
me to go madreveal thyself

No sooner had Artoff uttered this last word than he suddenly felt some
one swiftly approach him from behind as on that occasion upon the
boulevardand lay a hand upon his shoulder He wheeled roundand saw
no one But the consciousness of her presence became so distinct so
indubitable that he cast another hasty glance behind him

What was that In his armchair a couple of paces from him sat a
woman all in black Her head was bent to one side as in the
stereoscope It was she It was Clara But what a stern what a
mournful face

Artoff sank down gently upon his kneesYes he was right then
neither fear nor joy was in him nor even surprise His heart even
began to beat more quietlyThe only thing in him was the feeling Ah
At last At last

Clara he began in a faint but even tone why dost thou not look at
me I know it is thou  but I might seest thou think that my
imagination had created an image like that one He pointed in the
direction of the stereoscope Prove to me that it is thou Turn
toward me look at me Clara

Claras hand rose slowly  and fell again

Clara Clara Turn toward me

And Claras head turned slowly her drooping lids opened and the dark
pupils of her eyes were fixed on Artoff

He started back and uttered a tremulous longdrawn Ah

Clara gazed intently at him  but her eyes her features preserved
their original thoughtfullystern almost displeased expression With
precisely that expression she had presented herself on the platform upon
the day of the literary morning before she had caught sight of Artoff
And now as on that occasion also she suddenly flushed scarlet her
face grew animated her glance flashed and a joyful triumphant smile
parted her lips

I am forgivencried ArtoffThou hast conquered So take me
For I am thine and thou art mine

He darted toward her he tried to kiss those smiling those triumphant
lipsand he did kiss them he felt their burning touch he felt even
the moist chill of her teeth and a rapturous cry rang through the
halfdark room

Platonda Ivnovna ran in and found him in a swoon He was on his knees
his head was lying on the armchair his arms outstretched before him
hung powerless his pale face breathed forth the intoxication of
boundless happiness

Platonda Ivnovna threw herself beside him embraced him stammered
Ysha Yshenka Yashenynotchek tried to lift him up with her
bony arms  he did not stir Then Platonda Ivnovna set to screaming
in an unrecognisable voice The maidservant ran in Together they
managed somehow to lift him up seated him in a chair and began to dash
water on himand water in which a holy image had been washed at
that

He came to himself but merely smiled in reply to his aunts queries
and with such a blissful aspect that she became more perturbed than
ever and kept crossing first him and then herself At last Artoff
pushed away her hand and still with the same beatific expression on his
countenance he said

What is the matter with you Platsha

What ails thee Yshenka

MeI am happy  happy Platsha  that is what ails me But now I
want to go to bed and sleep

He tried to rise but felt such a weakness in his legs and in all his
body that he was not in a condition to undress and get into bed himself
without the aid of his aunt and of the maidservant But he fell asleep
very quickly preserving on his face that same blissfullyrapturous
expression Only his face was extremely pale




XVIII


When Platonda Ivnovna entered his room on the following morning he was
in the same condition  but his weakness had not passed off and he
even preferred to remain in bed Platonda Ivnovna did not like the
pallor of his face in particular

What does it mean O Lord she thought There isnt a drop of blood
in his face he refuses his beeftea he lies there and laughs and
keeps asserting that he is quite well

He refused breakfast alsoWhy dost thou do that Ysha she asked
him dost thou intend to lie like this all day

And what if I do replied Artoff affectionately

This very affection also did not please Platonda Ivnovna Artoff
wore the aspect of a man who has learned a great secret which is very
agreeable to him and is jealously clinging to it and reserving it for
himself He was waiting for night not exactly with impatience but with
curiosity

What comes next he asked himselfwhat will happen He had ceased
to be surprised to be perplexed he cherished no doubt as to his having
entered into communication with Clara that they loved each other  he
did not doubt either Only  what can come of such a loveHe
recalled that kiss  and a wondrous chill coursed swiftly and sweetly
through all his limbsRomeo and Juliet did not exchange such a kiss
as that he thought But the next time I shall hold out better I
shall possess her She will come with the garland of tiny roses in
her black curls

But after that what For we cannot live together can we Consequently
I must die in order to be with her Was not that what she came forand
is it not in that way she wishes to take me

Well and what of that If I must die I must Death does not terrify
me in the least now For it cannot annihilate me can it On the
contrary only thus and there shall I be happy  as I have never
been happy in my lifetime as she has never been in hers For we are
both unsulliedOh that kiss

                                   

Platonda Ivnovna kept entering Artoffs room she did not worry him
with questions she merely took a look at him whispered sighed and
went out againBut now he refused his dinner also Things were
getting quite too bad The old woman went off to her friend the medical
man of the policedistrict in whom she had faith simply because he did
not drink and was married to a German woman Artoff was astonished when
she brought the man to him but Platonda Ivnovna began so insistently
to entreat her Yshenka to permit Paramn Paramnitch that was the
medical mans name to examine himcome now just for her sakethat
Artoff consented Paramn Paramnitch felt his pulse looked at his
tongue interrogated him after a fashion and finally announced that it
was indispensably necessary to auscultate him Artoff was in such a
submissive frame of mind that he consented to this also The doctor
delicately laid bare his breast delicately tapped it listened smiled
prescribed some drops and a potion but chief of all advised him to be
quiet and refrain from violent emotions

You dont say so thought Artoff Well brother thou hast
bethought thyself too late

What ails Ysha asked Platonda Ivnovna as she handed Paramn
Paramnitch a threeruble banknote on the threshold The district
doctor who like all contemporary doctorsespecially those of them
who wear a uniformwas fond of showing off his learned terminology
informed her that her nephew had all the dioptric symptoms of nervous
cardialgia and that febris was present also

But speak more simply dear little father broke in Platonda
Ivnovna dont scare me with Latin thou art not in an apothecarys
shop

His heart is out of order explained the doctorwell and he has
fever also  and he repeated his advice with regard to repose and
moderation

But surely there is no danger sternly inquired Platonda Ivnovna as
much as to say Look out and dont try your Latin on me again

Not at present

The doctor went away and Platonda Ivnovna took to grieving
Nevertheless she sent to the apothecary for the medicine which Artoff
would not take despite her entreaties He even refused herbtea

What makes you worry so dear he said to her I assure you I am now
the most perfectly healthy and happy man in the whole world

Platonda Ivnovna merely shook her head Toward evening he became
slightly feverish yet he still insisted upon it that she should not
remain in his room and should go away to her own to sleep Platonda
Ivnovna obeyed but did not undress and did not go to bed she sat up
in an armchair and kept listening and whispering her prayer

She was beginning to fall into a doze when suddenly a dreadful
piercing shriek awakened her She sprang to her feet rushed into
Artoffs study and found him lying on the floor as upon the night
before

But he did not come to himself as he had done the night before work
over him as they would That night he was seized with a high fever
complicated by inflammation of the heart

A few days later he died

A strange circumstance accompanied his second swoon When they lifted
him up and put him to bed there proved to be a small lock of womans
black hair clutched in his right hand Where had that hair come from
Anna Semynovna had such a lock which she had kept after Claras death
but why should she have given to Artoff an object which was so precious
to her Could she have laid it into the diary and not noticed the fact
when she gave him the book

In the delirium which preceded his death Artoff called himself
Romeo  after the poison he talked about a marriage contracted
consummatedsaid that now he knew the meaning of delight Especially
dreadful for Platonda Ivnovna was the moment when Artoff recovering
consciousness and seeing her by his bedside said to her

Aunty why art thou weeping Is it because I must die But dost thou
not know that love is stronger than death Death O Death where is
thy sting Thou must not weep but rejoice even as I rejoice

And again the face of the dying man beamed with that same blissful smile
which had made the poor old woman shudder so






POEMS IN PROSE






From the Editor of the European Messenger


In compliance with our request Ivn Sergyevitch Turgnieff has given
his consent to our sharing now with the readers of our journal without
delay those passing comments thoughts images which he had noted down
under one impression or another of current existence during the last
five yearsthose which belong to him personally and those which
pertain to society in general They like many others have not found a
place in those finished productions of the past which have already been
presented to the world and have formed a complete collection in
themselves From among these the author has made fifty selections

In the letter accompanying the pages which we are now about to print I
S Turgnieff says in conclusion

 Let not your reader peruse these Poems in Prose at one sitting
he will probably be bored and the book will fall from his hands But
let him read them separatelytoday one tomorrow anotherand then
perchance some one of them may leave some trace behind in his soul

The pages have no general title the author has written on their
wrapper SeniliaAn Old Mans Jottingsbut we have preferred the
words carelessly dropped by the author in the end of his letter to us
quoted abovePoems in Proseand we print the pages under that
general title In our opinion it fully expresses the source from which
such comments might present themselves to the soul of an author well
known for his sensitiveness to the various questions of life as well as
the impression which they may produce on the reader leaving behind in
his soul many things They are in reality poems in spite of the fact
that they are written in prose We place them in chronological order
beginning with the year

THE VILLAGE


The last day of July for a thousand versts round about lies Russia the
fatherland

The whole sky is suffused with an even azure there is only one little
cloud in it which is half floating half melting There is no wind it
is warm  the air is like new milk

Larks are carolling largecropped pigeons are cooing the swallows dart
past in silence the horses neigh and munch the dogs do not bark but
stand peaceably wagging their tails

And there is an odour of smoke abroad and of grassand a tiny whiff
of tanand another of leatherThe hemppatches also are in their
glory and emit their heavy but agreeable fragrance

A deep but not long ravine Along its sides in several rows grow
bulkyheaded willows stripped bare at the bottom Through the ravine
runs a brook on its bottom tiny pebbles seem to tremble athwart its
pellucid ripplesFar away at the spot where the rims of earth and sky
come together is the bluish streak of a large river

Along the ravine on one side are neat little storehouses and buildings
with tightlyclosed doors on the other side are five or six pinelog
cottages with board roofs Over each roof rises a tall pole with a
starling house over each tiny porch is an openwork iron horses head
with a stiff mane The uneven windowpanes sparkle with the hues of
the rainbow Jugs holding bouquets are painted on the shutters In front
of each cottage stands sedately a precise little bench on the earthen
banks around the foundations of the house cats lie curled in balls with
their transparent ears pricked up on the alert behind the lofty
thresholds the anterooms look dark and cool

I am lying on the very brink of the ravine on an outspread horsecloth
round about are whole heaps of newmown hay which is fragrant to the
point of inducing faintness The sagacious householders have spread out
the hay in front of their cottages let it dry a little more in the hot
sun and then away with it to the barn It will be a glorious place for
a nap

The curly heads of children project from each haycock crested hens are
searching in the hay for gnats and small beetles a whitetoothed puppy
is sprawling among the tangled blades of grass

Ruddycurled youths in clean lowgirt shirts and heavy boots with
borders are bandying lively remarks as they stand with their breasts
resting on the unhitched carts and display their teeth in a grin

From a window a roundfaced lass peeps out she laughs partly at their
words and partly at the pranks of the children in the heapedup hay

Another lass with her sturdy arms is drawing a huge dripping bucket
from the well The bucket trembles and rocks on the rope scattering
long fiery drops

In front of me stands an aged housewife in a newchecked petticoat of
homespun and new peasantshoes

Large inflated beads in three rows encircle her thin swarthy neck her
grey hair is bound about with a yellow kerchief with red dots it droops
low over her dimmed eyes

But her aged eyes smile in cordial wise her whole wrinkled face smiles
The old woman must be in her seventh decade  and even now it can be
seen that she was a beauty in her day

With the sunburned fingers of her right hand widely spread apart she
holds a pot of cool unskimmed milk straight from the cellar the sides
of the pot are covered with dewdrops like small pearl beads On the
palm of her left hand the old woman offers me a big slice of bread still
warm from the oven As much as to say Eat and may health be thine
thou passing guest

A cock suddenly crows and busily flaps his wings an imprisoned calf
lows without haste in reply

Hey what fine oats the voice of my coachman makes itself heard

O Russian contentment repose plenty O free village O tranquillity
and abundance

And I thought to myself What care we for the cross on the dome of
Saint Sophia in Constantinople and all the other things for which we
strive we people of the town

A CONVERSATION

     Never yet has human foot trod either the
     Jungfrau or the Finsteraarhorn


The summits of the Alps A whole chain of steep cliffs The very
heart of the mountains

Overhead a bright mute palegreen sky A hard cruel frost firm
sparkling snow from beneath the snow project grim blocks of icebound
windworn cliffs

Two huge masses two giants rise aloft one on each side of the horizon
the Jungfrau and the Finsteraarhorn

And the Jungfrau says to its neighbour What news hast thou to tell
Thou canst see betterWhat is going on there below

Several thousand years pass by like one minute And the Finsteraarhorn
rumbles in reply Dense clouds veil the earth Wait

More thousands of years elapse as it were one minute

Well what now inquires the Jungfrau

Now I can see down yonder below everything is still the same
partycoloured tiny The waters gleam blue the forests are black
heaps of stones piled up shine grey Around them small beetles are still
bustlingthou knowest those twolegged beetles who have as yet been
unable to defile either thou or me

Men

Yes men

Thousands of years pass as it were one minute

Well and what now asks the Jungfrau

I seem to see fewer of the little beetles thunders the
Finsteraarhorn Things have become clearer down below the waters have
contracted the forests have grown thinner

More thousands of years pass as it were one minute

What dost thou see says the Jungfrau

Things seem to have grown clearer round us close at hand replies
the Finsteraarhorn well and yonder far away in the valleys there is
still a spot and something is moving

And now inquires the Jungfrau after other thousands of years which
are as one minute

Now it is well replies the Finsteraarhorn it is clean everywhere
quite white wherever one looks Everywhere is our snow level snow
and ice Everything is congealed It is well now and calm

Good said the JungfrauBut thou and I have chattered enough old
fellow It is time to sleep

It is time

The huge mountains slumber the green clear heaven slumbers over the
earth which has grown dumb forever

THE OLD WOMAN


I was walking across a spacious field alone

And suddenly I thought I heard light cautious footsteps behind my
back Some one was following me

I glanced round and beheld a tiny bent old woman all enveloped in grey
rags The old womans face was visible from beneath them a yellow
wrinkled sharpnosed toothless face

I stepped up to her She halted

Who art thou What dost thou want Art thou a beggar Dost thou expect
alms

The old woman made no answer I bent down to her and perceived that both
her eyes were veiled with a semitransparent whitish membrane or film
such as some birds have therewith they protect their eyes from too
brilliant a light

But in the old womans case that film did not move and reveal the
pupils  from which I inferred that she was blind

Dost thou want alms I repeated my questionWhy art thou following
meBut as before the old woman did not answer and merely shrank
back almost imperceptibly

I turned from her and went my way

And lo again I hear behind me those same light measured footsteps
which seem to be creeping stealthily up

Theres that woman again I said to myselfWhy has she attached
herself to meBut at this point I mentally added Probably owing to
her blindness she has lost her way and now she is guiding herself by
the sound of my steps in order to come out in company with me at some
inhabited place Yes yes that is it

But a strange uneasiness gradually gained possession of my thoughts it
began to seem to me as though that old woman were not only following
me but were guiding methat she was thrusting me now to the right
now to the left and that I was involuntarily obeying her

Still I continue to walk on  but now in front of me directly in my
road something looms up black and expands  some sort of pit The
grave flashes through my mindThat is where she is driving me

I wheel abruptly round Again the old woman is before me  but she
sees She gazes at me with large evil eyes which bode me ill  the
eyes of a bird of prey I bend down to her face to her eyes
Again there is the same film the same blind dull visage as before

Akh I think  this old woman is my Fatethat Fate which no man
can escape

I cannot get away I cannot get awayWhat madness I must make an
effort And I dart to one side in a different direction

I advance briskly But the light footsteps as before rustle behind
me close close behind me And in front of me again the pit yawns

Again I turn in another direction And again there is the same
rustling behind me the same menacing spot in front of me

And no matter in what direction I dart like a hare pursued  it is
always the same the same

Stay I thinkI will cheat her I will not go anywhere at
alland I instantaneously sit down on the ground

The old woman stands behind me two paces distantI do not hear her
but I feel that she is there

And suddenly I behold that spot which had loomed black in the distance
gliding on creeping up to me itself

O God I glance behind me The old woman is looking straight at me
and her toothless mouth is distorted in a grin

Thou canst not escape

THE DOG


There are two of us in the room my dog and I A frightful storm is
raging out of doors

The dog is sitting in front of me and gazing straight into my eyes

And I also am looking him straight in the eye

He seems to be anxious to say something to me He is dumb he has no
words he does not understand himselfbut I understand him

I understand that at this moment both in him and in me there dwells
one and the same feeling that there is no difference whatever between
us We are exactly alike in each of us there burns and glows the
selfsame tremulous flame

Death is swooping down upon us it is waving its cold broad wings

And this is the end

Who shall decide afterward precisely what sort of flame burned in each
one of us

No it is not an animal and a man exchanging glances

It is two pairs of eyes exactly alike fixed on each other

And in each of those pairs in the animal and in the man one and the
same life is huddling up timorously to the other

THE RIVAU


I had a comraderival not in our studies not in the service or in
love but our views did not agree on any point and every time we met
interminable arguments sprang up

We argued about art religion science about the life of earth and
matters beyond the graveespecially life beyond the grave

He was a believer and an enthusiast One day he said to me Thou
laughest at everything but if I die before thee I will appear to thee
from the other world We shall see whether thou wilt laugh then

And as a matter of fact he did die before me while he was still young
in years but years passed and I had forgotten his promisehis
threat

One night I was lying in bed and could not get to sleep neither did I
wish to do so

It was neither light nor dark in the room I began to stare into the
grey halfgloom

And suddenly it seemed to me that my rival was standing between the two
windows and nodding his head gently and sadly downward from above

I was not frightened I was not even surprised  but rising up
slightly in bed and propping myself on my elbow I began to gaze with
redoubled attention at the figure which had so unexpectedly presented
itself

The latter continued to nod its head

What is it I said at lastArt thou exulting Or art thou
pityingWhat is thisa warning or a reproach Or dost thou wish to
give me to understand that thou wert in the wrong That we were both in
the wrong What art thou experiencing The pains of hell The bliss of
paradise Speak at least one word

But my rival did not utter a single soundand only went on nodding his
head sadly and submissively as before downward from above

I burst out laughing  he vanished

THE BEGGAR MAN


I was passing along the street when a beggar a decrepit old man
stopped me

Swollen tearful eyes blue lips bristling rags unclean sores Oh
how horribly had poverty gnawed that unhappy being

He stretched out to me a red bloated dirty hand He moaned he
bellowed for help

I began to rummage in all my pockets Neither purse nor watch nor
even handkerchief did I find I had taken nothing with me

And the beggar still waited  and extended his hand which swayed and
trembled feebly

Bewildered confused I shook that dirty tremulous hand heartily

Blame me not brother I have nothing brother

The beggar man fixed his swollen eyes upon me his blue lips smiledand
in his turn he pressed my cold fingers

Never mind brother he mumbled Thanks for this also brotherThis
also is an alms brother

I understood that I had received an alms from my brother

THOU SHALT HEAR THE JUDGMENT OF THE DULLARD
                                              Pshkin


Thou shalt hear the judgment of the dullard Thou hast always
spoken the truth thou great writer of ours thou hast spoken it this
time also

The judgment of the dullard and the laughter of the crowd Who is
there that has not experienced both the one and the other

All this canand must be borne and whosoever hath the strengthlet
him despise it

But there are blows which beat more painfully on the heart itself A
man has done everything in his power he has toiled arduously lovingly
honestly And honest souls turn squeamishly away from him honest
faces flush with indignation at his name Depart Begone honest young
voices shout at himWe need neither thee nor thy work thou art
defiling our dwellingthou dost not know us and dost not understand
us Thou art our enemy

What is that man to do then Continue to toil make no effort to defend
himselfand not even expect a more just estimate

In former days tillers of the soil cursed the traveller who brought them
potatoes in place of bread the daily food of the poor man They
snatched the precious gift from the hands outstretched to them flung it
in the mire trod it under foot

Now they subsist upon itand do not even know the name of their
benefactor

So be it What matters his name to them He although he be nameless
has saved them from hunger

Let us strive only that what we offer may be equally useful food

Bitter is unjust reproach in the mouths of people whom one loves But
even that can be endured

Beat mebut hear me out said the Athenian chieftain to the Spartan
chieftain

Beat mebut be healthy and full fed is what we ought to say

February 




THE CONTENTED MAN


Along a street of the capital is skipping a man who is still youngHis
movements are cheerful alert his eyes are beaming his lips are
smiling his sensitive face is pleasantly rosy He is all contentment
and joy

What has happened to him Has he come into an inheritance Has he been
elevated in rank Is he hastening to a love tryst Or simply has he
breakfasted well and is it a sensation of health a sensation of
fullfed strength which is leaping for joy in all his limbs Or they may
have hung on his neck thy handsome eightpointed cross O Polish King
Stanislaus

No He has concocted a calumny against an acquaintance he has
assiduously disseminated it he has heard itthat same calumnyfrom
the mouth of another acquaintanceand has believed it himself

Oh how contented how good even at this moment is that nice
highlypromising young man

THE RULE OF LIFE


If you desire thoroughly to mortify and even to injure an opponent
said an old swindler to me reproach him with the very defect or vice
of which you feel conscious in yourselfFly into a rage  and
reproach him

In the first place that makes other people think that you do not
possess that vice

In the second place your wrath may even be sincere You may profit
by the reproaches of your own conscience

If for example you are a renegade reproach your adversary with
having no convictions

If you yourself are a lackey in soul say to him with reproof that he
is a lackey  the lackey of civilisation of Europe of socialism

You may even say the lackey of nonlackeyism I remarked

You may do that also chimed in the old rascal

THE END OF THE WORLD

A DREAM


It seems to me as though I am somewhere in Russia in the wilds in a
plain country house

The chamber is large lowceiled with three windows the walls are
smeared with white paint there is no furniture In front of the house
is a bare plain gradually descending it recedes into the distance the
grey monotoned sky hangs over it like a canopy

I am not alone half a score of men are with me in the room All plain
folk plainly clad they are pacing up and down in silence as though by
stealth They avoid one another and yet they are incessantly exchanging
uneasy glances

Not one of them knows why he has got into this house or who the men are
with him On all faces there is disquiet and melancholy  all in
turn approach the windows and gaze attentively about them as though
expecting something from without

Then again they set to roaming up and down Among us a lad of short
stature is running about from time to time he screams in a shrill
monotonous voice Daddy Im afraidThis shrill cry makes me sick at
heartand I also begin to be afraid Of what I myself do not know
Only I feel that a great great calamity is on its way and is drawing
near

And the little lad keeps screaming Akh if I could only get away from
here How stifling it is How oppressive But it is impossible to
escape

That sky is like a shroud And there is no wind Is the air dead

Suddenly the boy ran to the window and began to scream with the same
plaintive voice as usual Look Look The earth has fallen in

What Fallen inIn fact there had been a plain in front of the
house but now the house is standing on the crest of a frightful
mountainThe horizon has fallen has gone down and from the very
house itself a black almost perpendicular declivity descends

We have all thronged to the window Horror freezes our
heartsThere it is  there it is whispers my neighbour

And lo along the whole distant boundary of the earth something has
begun to stir some small round hillocks have begun to rise and fall

It is the sea occurs to us all at one and the same momentIt will
drown us all directly Only how can it wax and rise up On that
precipice

And nevertheless it does wax and wax hugely It is no longer
separate hillocks which are tumbling in the distance A dense
monstrous wave engulfs the entire circle of the horizon

It is flying flying upon usLike an icy hurricane it sweeps on
swirling with the outer darkness Everything round about has begun to
quiverand yonder in that oncoming massthere are crashing and
thunder and a thousandthroated iron barking

Ha What a roaring and howling It is the earth roaring with terror

It is the end of it The end of all things

The boy screamed once more I tried to seize hold of my comrades but
we all of us were already crushed buried drowned swept away by that
icy rumbling flood as black as ink

Darkness  eternal darkness

Gasping for breath I awoke

MASHA


When I was living in Petersburgmany years agowhenever I had
occasion to hire a public cabman I entered into conversation with him

I was specially fond of conversing with the night cabmenpoor
peasants of the suburbs who have come to town with their ochretinted
little sledges and miserable little nags in the hope of supporting
themselves and collecting enough money to pay their quitrent to their
owners

So then one day I hired such a cabman He was a youth of twenty
years tall wellbuilt a fine dashing young fellow he had blue eyes
and rosy cheeks his redgold hair curled in rings beneath a wretched
little patched cap which was pulled down over his very eyebrows And
how in the world was that tattered little coat ever got upon those
shoulders of heroic mould

But the cabmans handsome beardless face seemed sad and lowering

I entered into conversation with him Sadness was discernible in his
voice also

What is it brother I asked himWhy art not thou cheerful Hast
thou any grief

The young fellow did not reply to me at once

I have master I have he said at lastAnd such a grief that it
would be better if I were not alive My wife is dead

Didst thou love her  thy wife

The young fellow turned toward me only he bent his head a little

I did master This is the eighth month since  but I cannot forget
It is eating away my heart  so it is And why must she die She was
young Healthy In one day the cholera settled her

And was she of a good disposition

Akh master sighed the poor fellow heavilyAnd on what friendly
terms she and I lived together She died in my absence When I heard
here that they had already buried her I hurried immediately to the
village home It was already after midnight when I arrived I entered
my cottage stopped short in the middle of it and said so softly
Masha hey Masha Only a cricket shrilledThen I fell to weeping
and sat down on the cottage floor and how I did beat my palm against
the groundThy bowels are insatiable I said Thou hast devoured
her  devour me alsoAkh Masha

Masha he added in a suddenly lowered voice And without letting his
rope reins out of his hands he squeezed a tear out of his eye with his
mitten shook it off flung it to one side shrugged his shouldersand
did not utter another word

As I alighted from the sledge I gave him an extra fifteen kopks He
made me a low obeisance grasping his cap in both hands and drove off
at a footpace over the snowy expanse of empty street flooded with the
grey mist of the January frost

THE FOOL


Once upon a time a fool lived in the world

For a long time he lived in clover but gradually rumours began to reach
him to the effect that he bore the reputation everywhere of a brainless
ninny

The fool was disconcerted and began to fret over the question how he was
to put an end to those unpleasant rumours

A sudden idea at last illumined his dark little brain And without
the slightest delay he put it into execution

An acquaintance met him on the street and began to praise a wellknown
artist Good gracious exclaimed the fool that artist was
relegated to the archives long ago Dont you know thatI did not
expect that of you You are behind the times

The acquaintance was frightened and immediately agreed with the fool

What a fine book I have read today said another acquaintance to him

Good gracious cried the foolArent you ashamed of yourself That
book is good for nothing everybody dropped it in disgust long
agoDont you know thatYou are behind the times

And that acquaintance also was frightened and agreed with the fool

What a splendid man my friend N N is said a third acquaintance to
the foolTheres a truly noble being for you

Good graciousexclaimed the foolit is well known that N N is a
scoundrel He has robbed all his relatives Who is there that does not
know it You are behind the times

The third acquaintance also took fright and agreed with the fool and
renounced his friend And whosoever or whatsoever was praised in the
fools presence he had the same retort for all

He even sometimes added reproachfully And do you still believe in the
authorities

A malicious person A bilious man his acquaintances began to say
about the foolBut what a head

And what a tongue added others

Oh yes he is talented

It ended in the publisher of a newspaper proposing to the fool that he
should take charge of his critical department

And the fool began to criticise everything and everybody without making
the slightest change in his methods or in his exclamations

Now he who formerly shrieked against authorities is an authority
himselfand the young men worship him and fear him

But what are they to do poor fellows Although it is not
propergenerally speakingto worship  yet in this case if one does
not do it he will find himself classed among the men who are behind
the times

There is a career for fools among cowards

AN ORIENTAL LEGEND


Who in Bagdad does not know the great Giaffar the sun of the universe

One day many years ago when he was still a young man Giaffar was
strolling in the suburbs of Bagdad

Suddenly there fell upon his ear a hoarse cry some one was calling
desperately for help

Giaffar was distinguished among the young men of his own age for his
good sense and prudence but he had a compassionate heart and he
trusted to his strength

He ran in the direction of the cry and beheld a decrepit old man pinned
against the wall of the city by two brigands who were robbing him

Giaffar drew his sword and fell upon the malefactors One he slew the
other he chased away

The old man whom he had liberated fell at his rescuers feet and
kissing the hem of his garment exclaimed Brave youth thy magnanimity
shall not remain unrewarded In appearance I am a beggar but only in
appearance I am not a common manCome tomorrow morning early to the
chief bazaar I will await thee there at the fountainand thou shalt
convince thyself as to the justice of my words

Giaffar reflected In appearance this man is a beggar it is true but
all sorts of things happen Why should not I try the experimentand
he answered Good my father I will go

The old man looked him in the eye and went away

On the following morning just as day was breaking Giaffar set out for
the bazaar The old man was already waiting for him with his elbows
leaning on the marble basin of the fountain

Silently he took Giaffar by the hand and led him to a small garden
surrounded on all sides by high walls

In the very centre of this garden on a green lawn grew a tree of
extraordinary aspect

It resembled a cypress only its foliage was of azure hue

Three fruitsthree appleshung on the slender upcurving branches One
of medium size was oblong in shape of a milkywhite hue another was
large round and bright red the third was small wrinkled and
yellowish

The whole tree was rustling faintly although there was no wind It
tinkled delicately and plaintively as though it were made of glass it
seemed to feel the approach of Giaffar

Youthsaid the old man pluck whichever of these fruits thou wilt
and know that if thou shalt pluck and eat the white one thou shalt
become more wise than all men if thou shalt pluck and eat the red one
thou shalt become as rich as the Hebrew Rothschild if thou shalt pluck
and eat the yellow one thou shalt please old women Decide  and
delay not In an hour the fruits will fade and the tree itself will
sink into the dumb depths of the earth

Giaffar bowed his head and thoughtWhat am I to do he articulated
in a low tone as though arguing with himselfIf one becomes too
wise he will not wish to live probably if he becomes richer than all
men all will hate him I would do better to pluck and eat the third
the shrivelled apple

And so he did and the old man laughed a toothless laugh and said Oh
most wise youth Thou hast chosen the good partWhat use hast thou for
the white apple Thou art wiser than Solomon as thou artAnd neither
dost thou need the red apple Even without it thou shalt be rich
Only no one will be envious of thy wealth

Inform me old man said Giaffar with a start where the respected
mother of our Godsaved Caliph dwelleth

The old man bowed to the earth and pointed out the road to the youth

Who in Bagdad doth not know the sun of the universe the great the
celebrated Giaffar

TWO FOURLINE STANZAS


There existed once a city whose inhabitants were so passionately fond of
poetry that if several weeks passed and no beautiful new verses had made
their appearance they regarded that poetical dearth as a public
calamity

At such times they donned their worst garments sprinkled ashes on their
heads and gathering in throngs on the public squares they shed tears
and murmured bitterly against the Muse for having abandoned them

On one such disastrous day the young poet Junius presented himself on
the square filled to overflowing with the sorrowing populace

With swift steps he ascended a speciallyconstructed tribune and made a
sign that he wished to recite a poem

The lictors immediately brandished their staves Silence Attention
they shouted in stentorian tones

Friends Comrades began Junius in a loud but not altogether firm
voice

    Friends Comrades Ye lovers of verses
    Admirers of all that is graceful and fair
    Be not cast down by a moment of dark sadness
    The longedfor instant will come  and light
        will disperse the gloom

Junius ceased speaking  and in reply to him from all points of the
square clamour whistling and laughter arose

All the faces turned toward him flamed with indignation all eyes
flashed with wrath all hands were uplifted menaced were clenched into
fists

A pretty thing he has thought to surprise us with roared angry
voices Away from the tribune with the talentless rhymster Away with
the fool Hurl rotten apples bad eggs at the emptypated idiot Give
us stones Fetch stones

Junius tumbled headlong from the tribune  but before he had succeeded
in fleeing to his own house outbursts of rapturous applause cries of
laudation and shouts reached his ear

Filled with amazement but striving not to be detected for it is
dangerous to irritate an enraged wild beast Junius returned to the
square

And what did he behold

High above the throng above its shoulders on a flat gold shield stood
his rival the young poet Julius clad in a purple mantle with a
laurel wreath on his waving curls And the populace round about was
roaring Glory Glory Glory to the immortal Julius He hath comforted
us in our grief in our great woe He hath given us verses sweeter than
honey more melodious than the cymbals more fragrant than the rose
more pure than heavens azure Bear him in triumph surround his
inspired head with a soft billow of incense refresh his brow with the
waving of palm branches lavish at his feet all the spices of Arabia
Glory

Junius approached one of the glorifiersInform me O my
fellowtownsman With what verses hath Julius made you happyAlas I
was not on the square when he recited them Repeat them if thou canst
recall them I pray thee

Such versesand not recall them briskly replied the man
interrogatedFor whom dost thou take me Listenand rejoice rejoice
together with us

Ye lovers of versesthus began the divine Julius

    Ye lovers of verses Comrades Friends
    Admirers of all that is graceful melodious tender
    Be not east down by a moment of heavy grief
    The longedfor moment will comeand day will chase away the night

What dost thou think of that

Good gracious roared Junius Why those are my linesJulius must
have been in the crowd when I recited them he heard and repeated them
barely alteringand that of course not for the bettera few
expressions

Aha Now I recognise thee Thou art Junius retorted the citizen
whom he had accosted knitting his browsThou art either envious or a
fool Only consider just one thing unhappy man Julius says in such
lofty style And day will chase away the night But with thee it
is some nonsense or other And the light will disperse the
gloomWhat light What darkness

But is it not all one and the same thing Junius was beginning

Add one word more the citizen interrupted him and I will shout to
the populace and it will rend thee asunder

Junius prudently held his peace but a greyhaired old man who had
overheard his conversation with the citizen stepped up to the poor
poet and laying his hand on his shoulder said

Junius Thou hast said thy say at the wrong time but the other man
said his at the right timeconsequently he is in the right while for
thee there remain the consolations of thine own conscience

But while his conscience was consoling Junius to the best of its
abilityand in a decidedlyunsatisfactory way if the truth must be
toldfar away amid the thunder and patter of jubilation in the
golden dust of the allconquering sun gleaming with purple darkling
with laurel athwart the undulating streams of abundant incense with
majestic leisureliness like an emperor marching to his empire the
proudlyerect figure of Julius moved forward with easy grace  and
long branches of the palmtree bent in turn before him as though
expressing by their quiet rising their submissive obeisance that
incessantlyrenewed adoration which filled to overflowing the hearts of
his fellowcitizens whom he had enchanted

THE SPARROW


I had returned from the chase and was walking along one of the alleys in
the garden My hound was running on in front of me

Suddenly he retarded his steps and began to crawl stealthily along as
though he detected game ahead

I glanced down the alley and beheld a young sparrow with a yellow ring
around its beak and down on its head It had fallen from the nest the
wind was rocking the trees of the alley violently and sat motionless
impotently expanding its barelysprouted little wings

My hound was approaching it slowly when suddenly wrenching itself from
a neighbouring birch an old blackbreasted sparrow fell like a stone in
front of my dogs very muzzleand with plumage all ruffled contorted
with a despairing and pitiful cry gave a couple of hops in the
direction of the yawning jaws studded with big teeth

It had flung itself down to save it was shielding its offspring 
but the whole of its tiny body was throbbing with fear its voice was
wild and hoarse it was swooning it was sacrificing itself

What a huge monster the dog must have appeared to it And yet it could
not have remained perched on its lofty secure bough A force greater
than its own will had hurled it thence

My Trsor stopped short retreated Evidently he recognised that
force

I hastened to call off the discomfited hound and withdrew with
reverence

Yes do not laugh I felt reverential before that tiny heroic bird
before its loving impulse

Love I thought is stronger than deathOnly by it only by love does
life support itself and move

THE SKULLS


A sumptuous luxuriously illuminated ballroom a multitude of
cavaliers and ladies

All faces are animated all speeches are brisk A rattling
conversation is in progress about a wellknown songstress The people
are lauding her as divine immortal Oh how finely she had executed
her last trill that evening

And suddenlyas though at the wave of a magic wandfrom all the heads
from all the faces a thin shell of skin flew off and instantly there
was revealed the whiteness of skulls the naked gums and cheekbones
dimpled like bluish lead

With horror did I watch those gums and cheekbones moving and
stirringthose knobby bony spheres turning this way and that as they
gleamed in the light of the lamps and candles and smaller spheresthe
spheres of the eyes bereft of senserolling in them

I dared not touch my own face I dared not look at myself in a mirror
But the skulls continued to turn this way and that as before And
with the same clatter as before the brisk tongues flashing like red
rags from behind the grinning teeth murmured on how wonderfully how
incomparably the immortal  yes the immortal songstress had executed
her last trill

THE ROSE


The last days of August Autumn had already come

The sun had set A sudden violent rain without thunder and without
lightning had just swooped down upon our broad plain

The garden in front of the house burned and smoked all flooded with the
heat of sunset and the deluge of rain

She was sitting at a table in the drawingroom and staring with stubborn
thoughtfulness into the garden through the halfopen door

I knew what was going on then in her soul I knew that after a brief
though anguished conflict she would that same instant yield to the
feeling which she could no longer control

Suddenly she rose walked out briskly into the garden and disappeared

One hour struck  then another she did not return

Then I rose and emerging from the house I bent my steps to the alley
down whichI had no doubt as to thatshe had gone

Everything had grown dark round about night had already descended But
on the damp sand of the path gleaming scarlet amid the encircling
gloom a rounded object was visible

I bent down It was a young barelybudded rose Two hours before I had
seen that same rose on her breast

I carefully picked up the flower which had fallen in the mire and
returning to the drawingroom I laid it on the table in front of her
armchair

And now at last she returned and traversing the whole length of the
room with her light footsteps she seated herself at the table

Her face had grown pale and animated swiftly with merry confusion her
lowered eyes which seemed to have grown smaller darted about in all
directions

She caught sight of the rose seized it glanced at its crumpled petals
glanced at meand her eyes coming to a sudden halt glittered with
tears

What are you weeping about I asked

Why here about this rose Look what has happened to it

At this point I took it into my head to display profundity of thought

Your tears will wash away the mire I said with a significant
expression

Tears do not wash tears scorch she replied and turning toward the
fireplace she tossed the flower into the expiring flame

The fire will scorch it still better than tears she exclaimed not
without audacityand her beautiful eyes still sparkling with tears
laughed boldly and happily

I understood that she had been scorched also

IN MEMORY OF J P VRVSKY


In the mire on damp stinking straw under the penthouse of an old
carriagehouse which had been hastily converted into a field military
hospital in a ruined Bulgarian hamlet she had been for more than a
fortnight dying of typhus fever

She was unconsciousand not a single physician had even glanced at her
the sick soldiers whom she had nursed as long as she could keep on her
feet rose by turns from their infected lairs in order to raise to her
parched lips a few drops of water in a fragment of a broken jug

She was young handsome high society knew her even dignitaries
inquired about her The ladies envied her the men courted her  two
or three men loved her secretly and profoundly Life smiled upon her
but there are smiles which are worse than tears

A tender gentle heart  and such strength such a thirst for
sacrifice To help those who needed help  she knew no other happiness
 she knew no other and she tasted no other Every other happiness
passed her by But she had long since become reconciled to that and all
flaming with the fire of inextinguishable faith she dedicated herself
to the service of her fellowmen What sacred treasures she held hidden
there in the depths of her soul in her own secret recesses no one
ever knewand now no one will ever know

And to what end The sacrifice has been made  the deed is done

But it is sorrowful to think that no one said thank you even to her
corpse although she herself was ashamed of and shunned all thanks

May her dear shade be not offended by this tardy blossom which I
venture to lay upon her grave

THE LAST MEETING


We were once close intimate friends But there came an evil moment
and we parted like enemies

Many years passed And lo on entering the town where he lived I
learned that he was hopelessly ill and wished to see me

I went to him I entered his chamber Our glances met

I hardly recognised him O God How disease had changed him

Yellow shrivelled with his head completely bald and a narrow grey
beard he was sitting in nothing but a shirt cut out expressly He
could not bear the pressure of the lightest garment Abruptly he
extended to me his frightfullythin hand which looked as though it had
been gnawed away with an effort whispered several incomprehensible
wordswhether of welcome or of reproach who knows His exhausted chest
heaved over the contracted pupils of his small inflamed eyes two
scanty tears of martyrdom flowed down

My heart sank within me I sat down on a chair beside him and
involuntarily dropping my eyes in the presence of that horror and
deformity I also put out my hand

But it seemed to me that it was not his hand which grasped mine

It seemed to me as though there were sitting between us a tall quiet
white woman A long veil enveloped her from head to foot Her deep pale
eyes gazed nowhere her pale stern lips uttered no sound

That woman joined our hands She reconciled us forever

Yes It was Death who had reconciled us

THE VISIT


I was sitting at the open window  in the morning early in the
morning on the first of May

The flush of dawn had not yet begun but the dark warm night was
already paling already growing chill

No fog had risen no breeze was straying everything was of one hue and
silent  but one could scent the approach of the awakening and in the
rarefied air the scent of the dews harsh dampness was abroad

Suddenly into my chamber through the open window flew a large bird
lightly tinkling and rustling

I started looked more intently It was not a bird it was a tiny
winged woman clad in a long closefitting robe which billowed out at
the bottom

She was all grey the hue of motherofpearl only the inner side of her
wings glowed with a tender flush of scarlet like a rose bursting into
blossom a garland of liliesofthevalley confined the scattered curls
of her small round headand two peacock feathers quivered amusingly
like the feelers of a butterfly above the fair rounded little
forehead

She floated past a couple of times close to the ceiling her tiny face
was laughing laughing also were her huge black luminous eyes The
merry playfulness of her capricious flight shivered their diamond rays

She held in her hand a long frond of a steppe flowerImperial
sceptre the Russian folk call it and it does indeed resemble a
sceptre

As she flew rapidly above me she touched my head with that flower

I darted toward her But she had already fluttered through the
window and away she flew headlong

In the garden in the wilderness of the lilacbushes a turtledove
greeted her with its first cooing and at the spot where she had
vanished the milkywhite sky flushed a soft crimson

I recognised thee goddess of fancy Thou hast visited me by
accidentthou hast flown in to young poets

O poetry O youth O virginal beauty of woman Only for an instant can
ye gleam before mein the early morning of the early spring

ALMS


In the vicinity of a great city on the broad muchtravelled road an
aged ailing man was walking

He was staggering as he went his emaciated legs entangling themselves
trailing and stumbling trod heavily and feebly exactly as though they
belonged to some one else his clothing hung on him in rags his bare
head drooped upon his breast He was exhausted

He squatted down on a stone by the side of the road bent forward
propped his elbows on his knees covered his face with both hands and
between his crooked fingers the tears dripped on the dry grey dust

He was remembering

He remembered how he had once been healthy and richand how he had
squandered his health and distributed his wealth to others friends and
enemies And lo now he had not a crust of bread and every one had
abandoned him his friends even more promptly than his enemies Could
he possibly humble himself to the point of asking alms And he felt
bitter and ashamed at heart

And the tears still dripped and dripped mottling the grey dust

Suddenly he heard some one calling him by name He raised his weary
head and beheld in front of him a stranger a face calm and dignified
but not stern eyes not beaming but bright a gaze penetrating but not
evil

Thou hast given away all thy wealth an even voice made itself
heard But surely thou art not regretting that thou hast done good

I do not regret it replied the old man with a sigh only here am I
dying now

And if there had been no beggars in the world to stretch out their
hands to thee pursued the stranger thou wouldst have had no one to
whom to show thy beneficence thou wouldst not have been able to
exercise thyself therein

The old man made no reply and fell into thought

Therefore be not proud now my poor man spoke up the stranger again
Go stretch out thy hand afford to other good people the possibility
of proving by their actions that they are good

The old man started and raised his eyes  but the stranger had
already vanishedbut far away on the road a wayfarer made his
appearance

The old man approached him and stretched out his handThe wayfarer
turned away with a surly aspect and gave him nothing

But behind him came another and this one gave the old man a small alms

And the old man bought bread for himself with the copper coins which had
been given him and sweet did the bit which he had begged seem to him
and there was no shame in his heartbut on the contrary a tranquil
joy overshadowed him

THE INSECT


I dreamed that a score of us were sitting in a large room with open
windows

Among us were women children old men We were all talking about
some very unfamiliar subjecttalking noisily and unintelligibly

Suddenly with a harsh clatter a huge insect about three inches and a
half long flew into the room  flew in circled about and alighted on
the wall

It resembled a fly or a waspIts body was of a dirty hue its flat
hard wings were of the same colour it had extended shaggy claws and a
big angular head like that of a dragonfly and that head and the
claws were bright red as though bloody

This strange insect kept incessantly turning its head downward upward
to the right to the left and moving its claws about  then suddenly
it wrested itself from the wall flew clattering through the roomand
again alighted again began to move in terrifying and repulsive manner
without stirring from the spot It evoked in all of us disgust alarm
even terror None of us had ever seen anything of the sort we all
cried Expel that monster We all flourished our handkerchiefs at it
from a distance  for no one could bring himself to approach it 
and when the insect had flown in we had all involuntarily got out of the
way

Only one of our interlocutors a palefaced man who was still young
surveyed us all with surpriseHe shrugged his shoulders he smiled he
positively could not understand what had happened to us and why we were
so agitated He had seen no insect he had not heard the ominous clatter
of its wings

Suddenly the insect seemed to rivet its attention on him soared into
the air and swooping down upon his head stung him on the brow a
little above the eyes The young man emitted a faint cry and fell
dead

The dreadful fly immediately flew away Only then did we divine what
sort of a visitor we had had

CABBAGESOUP


The son of a widowed peasantwoman dieda young fellow aged twenty the
best labourer in the village

The ladyproprietor of that village on learning of the peasantwomans
affliction went to call upon her on the very day of the funeral

She found her at home

Standing in the middle of her cottage in front of the table she was
ladling out empty cabbagesoup from the bottom of a smokebegrimed
pot in a leisurely way with her right hand her left hung limply by
her side and swallowing spoonful after spoonful

The womans face had grown sunken and dark her eyes were red and
swollen  but she carried herself independently and uprightly as in
church

O Lord thought the lady she can eat at such a moment  but what
coarse feelings they have

And then the ladymistress recalled how when she had lost her own
little daughter aged nine months a few years before she had refused
out of grief to hire a very beautiful villa in the vicinity of
Petersburg and had passed the entire summer in townBut the
peasantwoman continued to sip her cabbagesoup

At last the lady could endure it no longerTatyna said she
Good graciousI am amazed Is it possible that thou didst not love
thy son How is it that thy appetite has not disappearedHow canst
thou eat that cabbagesoup

My Vsya is dead replied the woman softly and tears of suffering
again began to stream down her sunken cheeksand of course my own

alive But the cabbagesoup must not go to waste for it is salted

The ladymistress merely shrugged her shoulders and went away She got

THE AZURE REALM


O azure realm O realm of azure light youth and happiness I have
beheld thee  in my dreams

There were several of us in a beautiful decorated boat Like the breast
of a swan the white sail towered aloft beneath fluttering pennants

I did not know who my companions were but with all my being I felt that
they were as young as merry as happy as I was

And I paid no heed to them All about me I beheld only the shoreless
azure sea all covered with a fine rippling of golden scales and
overhead an equally shoreless azure sea and in it triumphantly and
as it were smilingly rolled on the friendly sun

And among us from time to time there arose laughter ringing and
joyous as the laughter of the gods

Or suddenly from some ones lips flew forth words verses replete with
wondrous beauty and with inspired power  so that it seemed as though
the very sky resounded in reply to them and round about the sea
throbbed with sympathy And then blissful silence began again

Diving lightly through the soft waves our swift boat glided on It was
not propelled by the breeze it was ruled by our own sportive hearts
Whithersoever we wished thither did it move obediently as though it
were gifted with life

We encountered islands magical halftransparent islands with the hues
of precious stones jacinths and emeralds Intoxicating perfumes were
wafted from the surrounding shores some of these islands pelted us with
a rain of white roses and liliesofthevalley from others there rose
up suddenly longwinged birds clothed in rainbow hues

The birds circled over our heads the lilies and roses melted in the
pearly foam which slipped along the smooth sides of our craft

In company with the flowers and the birds sweet sweet sounds were
wafted to our ears We seemed to hear womens voices in them And
everything round aboutthe sky the sea the bellying of the sail up
aloft the purling of the waves at the sterneverything spoke of love
of blissful love

And she whom each one of us lovedshe was there  invisibly and near
at hand Yet another moment and lo her eyes would beam forth her smile
would blossom out Her hand would grasp thy hand and draw thee after
her into an unfading paradise

O azure realm I have beheld thee  in my dream

TWO RICH MEN


When men in my presence extol Rothschild who out of his vast revenues
allots whole thousands for the education of children the cure of the
sick the care of the aged I laud and melt in admiration

But while I laud and melt I cannot refrain from recalling a
povertystricken peasants family which received an orphaned niece into
its wretched tumbledown little hovel

If we take Ktka said the peasantwoman we shall spend our last
kopks on her and there will be nothing left wherewith to buy salt for
our porridge

But we will take her  and unsalted porridge replied the
peasantman her husband

Rothschild is a long way behind that peasantman

THE OLD MAN


The dark distressing days have come

Ones own maladies the ailments of those dear to him cold and the
gloom of old age Everything which thou hast loved to which thou hast
surrendered thyself irrevocably collapses and falls into ruins The
road has taken a turn down hill

But what is to be done Grieve Lament Thou wilt help neither thyself
nor others in that way

On the withered bent tree the foliage is smaller more scantybut the
verdure is the same as ever

Do thou also shrivel up retire into thyself into thy memories and
there deep very deep within at the very bottom of thy concentrated
soul thy previous life accessible to thee alone will shine forth
before thee with its fragrant still fresh verdure and the caress and
strength of the springtime

But have a care  do not look ahead poor old man

TWO BROTHERS


It was a vision

Two angels presented themselves before me  two spirits

I say angels  spirits because neither of them had any garments on
their naked bodies and from the shoulders of both sprang long powerful
wings

Both are youths One is rather plump smooth of skin with black curls
He has languishing brown eyes with thick eyelashes his gaze is
ingratiating cheerful and eager A charming captivating countenance a
trifle bold a trifle malicious His full red lips tremble slightly The
youth smiles like one who has authorityconfidently and lazily a
sumptuous garland of flowers rests lightly on his shining hair almost
touching his velvet eyebrows The spotted skin of a leopard pinned with
a golden dart hangs lightly from his plump shoulders down upon his
curving hips The feathers of his wings gleam with changeable tints of
rosecolour their tips are of a brilliant red just as though they had
been dipped in fresh crimson blood From time to time they palpitate
swiftly with a pleasant silvery sound the sound of rain in springtime

The other is gaunt and yellow of body His ribs are faintly discernible
at every breath His hair is fair thin straight his eyes are huge
round pale grey in colour  his gaze is uneasy and strangely bright
All his features are sharpcut his mouth is small half open with
fishlike teeth his nose is solid aquiline his chin projecting
covered with a whitish down Those thin lips have never once smiled

It is a regular terrible pitiless face Moreover the face of the
first youthof the beautyalthough it is sweet and charming does
not express any compassion either Around the head of the second are
fastened a few empty broken ears of grain intertwined with withered
blades of grass A coarse grey fabric encircles his loins the wings at
his back of a dull darkblue colour wave softly and menacingly

Both youths appeared to be inseparable companions

Each leaned on the others shoulder The soft little hand of the first
rested like a cluster of grapes on the harsh collarbone of the second
the slender bony hand of the second with its long thin fingers lay
outspread like a serpent on the womanish breast of the first

And I heard a voice This is what it uttered

Before thee stand Love and Hungerown brothers the two fundamental
bases of everything living

Everything which lives moves for the purpose of obtaining food and
eats for the purpose of reproducing itself

Love and Hunger have one and the same object it is necessary that life
should not ceaseones own life and the life of others are the same
thing the universal life

THE EGOIST


He possessed everything which was requisite to make him the scourge of
his family

He had been born healthy he had been born richand during the whole
course of his long life he had remained rich and healthy he had never
committed a single crime he had never stumbled into any blunder he had
not made a single slip of the tongue or mistake

He was irreproachably honest And proud in the consciousness of his
honesty he crushed every one with it relatives friends and
acquaintances

His honesty was his capital  and he exacted usurious interest from
it

Honesty gave him the right to be pitiless and not to do any good deed
which was not prescribedand he was pitiless and he did no good 
because good except by decree is not good

He never troubled himself about any one except his own very exemplary
self and he was genuinely indignant if others did not take equally
assiduous care of it

And at the same time he did not consider himself an egoist and
upbraided and persecuted egoists and egoism more than anything
elseOf course Egoism in other people interfered with his own

Not being conscious of a single failing he did not understand he did
not permit a weakness in any one else Altogether he did not
understand anybody or anything for he was completely surrounded by
himself on all sides above and below behind and before

He did not even understand the meaning of forgiveness He never had had
occasion to forgive himself Then how was he to forgive others

Before the bar of his own conscience before the face of his own God
he that marvel that monster of virtue rolled up his eyes and in a
firm clear voice uttered Yes I am a worthy a moral man

He repeated these words on his deathbed and nothing quivered even then
in his stony heartin that heart devoid of a fleck or a crack

O monstrosity of selfsatisfied inflexible cheaplyacquired
virtuethou art almost more repulsive than the undisguised monstrosity
of vice

THE SUPREME BEINGS FEAST


One day the Supreme Being took it into his head to give a great feast in
his azure palace

He invited all the virtues as guests Only the virtues  he invited no
men  only ladies

Very many of them assembled great and small The petty virtues were
more agreeable and courteous than the great ones but all seemed well
pleased and chatted politely among themselves as befits near relatives
and friends

But lo the Supreme Being noticed two very beautiful ladies who
apparently were entirely unacquainted with each other

The host took one of these ladies by the hand and led her to the other

Beneficence said he pointing to the first

Gratitude he added pointing to the second

The two virtues were unspeakably astonished ever since the world has
existedand it has existed a long timethey had never met before

THE SPHINX


Yellowishgrey friable at the top firm below creaking sand  sand
without end no matter in which direction one gazes

And above this sand above this sea of dead dust the huge head of the
Egyptian Sphinx rears itself aloft

What is it that those vast protruding lips those impassivelydilated
upturned nostrils and those eyes those long halfsleepy
halfwatchful eyes beneath the double arch of the lofty brows are
trying to say

For they are trying to say something They even speakbut only
Oedipus can solve the riddle and understand their mute speech

Bah Yes I recognise those features  there is nothing Egyptian about
the low white forehead the prominent cheekbones the short straight
nose the fine mouth with its white teeth the soft moustache and
curling beardand those small eyes set far apart  and on the head
the cap of hair furrowed with a parting Why it is thou Karp
Sdor Semyn thou petty peasant of Yaroslvl or of Ryazn my
fellowcountryman the kernel of Russia Is it long since thou didst
become the Sphinx

Or dost thou also wish to say something Yes and thou also art a
Sphinx

And thy eyesthose colourless but profound eyesspeak also And
their speeches are equally dumb and enigmatic

Only where is thine Oedipus

Alas Tis not sufficient to don a cap to become thine Oedipus O
Sphinx of All the Russias

NYMPHS


I was standing in front of a chain of beautiful mountains spread out in
a semicircle the young verdant forest clothed them from summit to
base The southern sky hung transparently blue above us on high the sun
beamed radiantly below half hidden in the grass nimble brooks were
babbling

And there recurred to my mind an ancient legend about how in the first
century after the birth of Christ a Grecian ship was sailing over the
Aegean Sea

It was midday The weather was calm And suddenly high up over the
head of the helmsman some one uttered distinctly When thou shalt sail
past the islands cry in a loud voice Great Pan is dead

The helmsman was amazed  and frightened But when the ship ran past
the islands he called out Great Pan is dead

And thereupon immediately in answer to his shout along the whole
length of the shore for the island was uninhabited there resounded
loud sobbing groans prolonged wailing cries He is dead Great Pan is
dead

This legend recurred to my mind  and a strange thought flashed across
my brainWhat if I were to shout that call

But in view of the exultation which surrounded me I could not think of
death and with all the force at my command I shouted He is risen
Great Pan is risen

And instantlyoh marvelin reply to my exclamation along the whole
wide semicircle of verdant mountains there rolled a vigorous laughter
there arose a joyous chattering and splashing He is risen Pan is
risen rustled youthful voicesEverything there in front of me
suddenly broke into laughter more brilliant than the sun on high more
sportive than the brooks which were babbling beneath the grass The
hurried tramp of light footsteps became audible athwart the green grove
flitted the marble whiteness of waving tunics the vivid scarlet of
naked bodies It was nymphs nymphs dryads bacchantes running down
from the heights into the plain

They made their appearance simultaneously along all the borders of the
forest Curls fluttered on divine heads graceful arms uplifted garlands
and cymbals and laughter sparkling Olympian laughter rippled and
rolled among them

In front floats a goddess She is taller and handsomer than all the
reston her shoulders is a quiver in her hands is a bow upon her
curls caught high is the silvery sickle of the moon

Diana is it thou

But suddenly the goddess halted  and immediately following her
example all the nymphs came to a halt also The ringing laughter died
away I saw how the face of the goddess suddenly rendered dumb became
covered with a deathly pallor I saw how her feet grew petrified how
inexpressible terror parted her lips strained wide her eyes which were
fixed on the remote distance What had she descried Where was she
gazing

I turned in the direction in which she was gazing

At the very edge of the sky beyond the low line of the fields a golden
cross was blazing like a spark of fire on the white belfry of a
Christian church The goddess had caught sight of that cross

I heard behind me a long uneven sigh like the throbbing of a broken
harpstringand when I turned round again no trace of the nymphs
remained The broad forest gleamed green as before and only in
spots athwart the close network of the branches could tufts of
something white be seen melting away Whether these were the tunics of
the nymphs or a vapour was rising up from the bottom of the valley I
know not

But how I regretted the vanished goddesses

ENEMY AND FRIEND


A captive condemned to perpetual incarceration broke out of prison and
started to run at a headlong pace After him on his very heels
darted the pursuit

He ran with all his might His pursuers began to fall behind

But lo in front of him was a river with steep banksa narrow but
deep river And he did not know how to swim

From one shore to the other a thin rotten board had been thrown The
fugitive had already set foot upon it But it so happened that just
at this point beside the river his best friend and his most cruel
enemy were standing

The enemy said nothing and merely folded his arms on the other hand
the friend shouted at the top of his voiceGood heavens What art
thou doing Come to thy senses thou madman Dost thou not see that
the board is completely rottenIt will break beneath thy weight and
thou wilt infallibly perish

But there is no other way of crossing  and hearest thou the
pursuit groaned in desperation the unhappy wight as he stepped upon
the board

I will not permit it No I will not permit thee to perishroared
his zealous friend snatching the plank from beneath the feet of the
fugitiveThe latter instantly tumbled headlong into the tumultuous
watersand was drowned

The enemy smiled with satisfaction and went his way but the friend sat
down on the shore and began to weep bitterly over his poor  poor
friend

He would not heed me He would not heed me he whispered dejectedly

However he said at last He would have been obliged to languish all
his life in that frightful prison At all events he is not suffering
now Now he is better off Evidently so had his Fate decreed

And yet it is a pity from a human point of view

And the good soul continued to sob inconsolably over his unlucky friend

CHRIST


I saw myself as a youth almost a little boy in a lowceiled country
churchSlender wax tapers burned like red spots in front of the
ancient holy pictures

An aureole of rainbow hues encircled each tiny flameIt was dark and
dim in the church But a mass of people stood in front of me

All reddish peasant heads From time to time they would begin to surge
to fall to rise again like ripe ears of grain when the summer breeze
flits across them in a slow wave

Suddenly some man or other stepped from behind and took up his stand
alongside me

I did not turn toward him but I immediately felt that that man
wasChrist

Emotion curiosity awe took possession of me simultaneously I forced
myself to look at my neighbour

He had a face like that of everybody elsea face similar to all human
faces His eyes gazed slightly upward attentively and gently His lips
were closed but not compressed the upper lip seemed to rest upon the
lower his small beard was parted in the middle His hands were clasped
and did not move And his garments were like those of every one else

Christ forsooth I thought to myself Such a simple simple man It
cannot be

I turned awayBut before I had time to turn my eyes from that simple
man it again seemed to me that it was Christ in person who was standing
beside me

Again I exerted an effort over myself And again I beheld the same
face resembling all human faces the same ordinary although
unfamiliar features

And suddenly dread fell upon me and I came to myself Only then did I
understand that precisely such a facea face like all human facesis
the face of Christ

THE STONE


Have you seen an old old stone on the seashore when the brisk waves
are beating upon it from all sides at high tide on a sunny spring
daybeating and sparkling and caressing it and drenching its mossy
head with crumbling pearls of glittering foam

The stone remains the same stone but brilliant colours start forth upon
its surly exterior

They bear witness to that distant time when the molten granite was only
just beginning to harden and was all glowing with fiery hues

Thus also did young feminine souls recently attack my old heart from all
quartersand beneath their caressing touch it glowed once more with
colours which faded long agowith traces of its pristine fire

The waves have retreated  but the colours have not yet grown dim
although a keen breeze is drying them

DOVES


I was standing on the crest of a sloping hill in front of me lay
outspread and motley of hue the ripe rye now like a golden again
like a silvery sea

But no surge was coursing across this sea no sultry breeze was blowing
a great thunderstorm was brewing

Round about me the sun was still shining hotly and dimly but in the
distance beyond the rye not too far away a darkblue thundercloud
lay in a heavy mass over one half of the horizon

Everything was holding its breath  everything was languishing beneath
the ominous gleam of the suns last rays Not a single bird was to be
seen or heard even the sparrows had hidden themselves Only somewhere
close at hand a solitary huge leaf of burdock was whispering and
flapping

How strongly the wormwood on the borderstrips smells I glanced at
the blue mass  and confusion ensued in my soul Well be quick
then be quick I thought Flash out ye golden serpent Rumble ye
thunder Move on advance discharge thy water thou evil thundercloud
put an end to this painful torment

But the stormcloud did not stir As before it continued to crush the
dumb earth  and seemed merely to wax larger and darker

And lo through its bluish monotony there flashed something smooth and
even precisely like a white handkerchief or a snowball It was a white
dove flying from the direction of the village

It flew and flew onward always straight onward  and vanished behind
the forest

Several moments passedthe same cruel silence still reigned But
behold Now two handkerchiefs are fluttering two snowballs are
floating back it is two white doves wending their way homeward in
even flight

And now at last the storm has broken looseand the fun begins

I could hardly reach homeThe wind shrieked and darted about like a
mad thing lowhanging rustyhued clouds swirled onward as though rent
in bits everything whirled got mixed up lashed and rocked with the
slanting columns of the furious downpour the lightning flashes blinded
with their fiery green hue abrupt claps of thunder were discharged like
cannon there was a smell of sulphur

But under the eaves on the very edge of a garret window side by side
sit the two white dovesthe one which flew after its companion and
the one which it brought and perhaps saved

Both have ruffled up their plumage and each feels with its wing the
wing of its neighbour

It is well with them And it is well with me as I gaze at them
Although I am alone  alone as always

TOMORROW TOMORROW


How empty and insipid and insignificant is almost every day which we
have lived through How few traces it leaves behind it In what a
thoughtlesslystupid manner have those hours flown past one after
another

And nevertheless man desires to exist he prizes life he hopes in it
in himself in the future Oh what blessings he expects from the
future

And why does he imagine that other future days will not resemble the one
which has just passed

But he does not imagine this On the whole he is not fond of
thinkingand it is well that he does not

There now tomorrow tomorrow he comforts himselfuntil that
tomorrow overthrows him into the grave

Welland once in the graveone ceases willynilly to think

NATURE


I dreamed that I had entered a vast subterranean chamber with a lofty
arched roof It was completely filled by some sort of even light also
subterranean

In the very centre of the chamber sat a majestic woman in a flowing robe
green in hue With her head bowed on her hand she seemed to be immersed
in profound meditation

I immediately understood that this woman was Nature itselfand
reverent awe pierced my soul with an instantaneous chill

I approached the seated woman and making a respectful obeisance O our
common mother I exclaimed what is the subject of thy meditation Art
thou pondering the future destinies of mankind As to how it is to
attain the utmost possible perfection and bliss

The woman slowly turned her dark lowering eyes upon me Her lips moved
and a stentorian voice like unto the clanging of iron rang out

I am thinking how I may impart more power to the muscles in the legs of
a flea so that it may more readily escape from its enemies The
equilibrium of attack and defence has been destroyed It must be
restored

What I stammered in replySo that is what thou art thinking
about But are not we men thy favourite children

The woman knit her brows almost imperceptiblyAll creatures are my
children she said and I look after all of them alikeand I
annihilate them in identically the same way

But good  reason  justice I stammered again

Those are the words of men rang out the iron voice I know neither
good nor evil Reason is no law to meand what is justiceI have
given thee lifeI take it away and give it to others whether worms or
men  it makes no difference to me But in the meantime do thou
defend thyself and hinder me not

I was about to answer  but the earth round about me uttered a dull
groan and trembledand I awoke

HANG HIM


It happened in the year  began my old friend not long before
Austerlitz The regiment of which I was an officer was quartered in
Moravia

We were strictly forbidden to harry and oppress the inhabitants and
they looked askance on us as it was although we were regarded as
allies

I had an orderly a former serf of my mothers Egr by name He was an
honest and peaceable fellow I had known him from his childhood and
treated him like a friend

One day in the house where I dwelt abusive shrieks and howls arose
the housewife had been robbed of two hens and she accused my orderly of
the theft He denied it and called upon me to bear witness whether he
Egr Avtamnoff would steal I assured the housewife of Egrs
honesty but she would listen to nothing

Suddenly the energetic trampling of horses hoofs resounded along the
street it was the CommanderinChief himself riding by with his staff
He was proceeding at a footpacea fat potbellied man with drooping
head and epaulets dangling on his breast

The housewife caught sight of him and flinging herself across his
horses path she fell on her knees and all distraught with head
uncovered began loudly to complain of my orderly pointing to him with
her hand

Sir General she shrieked Your Radiance Judge Help Save This
soldier has robbed me

Egr was standing on the threshold of the house drawn up in military
salute with his cap in his handand had even protruded his breast and
turned out his feet like a sentryand not a word did he utter
Whether he was daunted by all that mass of generals halting there in the
middle of the street or whether he was petrified in the presence of the
calamity which had overtaken himat any rate there stood my Egr
blinking his eyes and white as clay

The CommanderinChief cast an abstracted and surly glance at him
bellowing wrathfully Well what hast thou to say Egr stood like
a statue and showed his teeth If looked at in profile it was exactly
as though the man were laughing

Then the CommanderinChief said abruptly Hang himgave his horse
a dig in the ribs and rode on first at a footpace as before then at
a brisk trot The whole staff dashed after him only one adjutant
turning round in his saddle took a close look at Egr

It was impossible to disobey Egr was instantly seized and led to
execution

Thereupon he turned deadly pale and only exclaimed a couple of times
with difficulty Good heavens Good heavensand then in a low
voiceGod sees it was not I

He wept bitterly very bitterly as he bade me farewell I was in
despairEgr Egr I cried why didst thou say nothing to the
general

God sees it was not I repeated the poor fellow sobbingThe
housewife herself was horrified She had not in the least expected such
a dreadful verdict and fell to shrieking in her turn She began to
entreat each and all to spare him she declared that her hens had been
found that she was prepared to explain everything herself

Of course this was of no use whatsoever Military regulations sir
DisciplineThe housewife sobbed more and more loudly

Egr whom the priest had already confessed and communicated turned to
me

Tell her Your WellBorn that she must not do herself an injury
For I have already forgiven her

As my friend repeated these last words of his servant he whispered
Egrushka darling just manand the tears dripped down his aged
cheeks

WHAT SHALL I THINK


What shall I think when I come to dieif I am then in a condition to
think

Shall I think what a bad use I have made of my life how I have dozed
it through how I have not known how to relish its gifts

What Is this death already So soon Impossible Why I have not
succeeded in accomplishing anything yet I have only been preparing
to act

Shall I recall the past pause over the thought of the few bright
moments I have lived through over beloved images and faces

Will my evil deeds present themselves before my memory and will the
corrosive grief of a belated repentance descend upon my soul

Shall I think of what awaits me beyond the grave  yes and whether
anything at all awaits me there

No  it seems to me that I shall try not to think and shall compel my
mind to busy itself with some nonsense or other if only to divert my
own attention from the menacing darkness which looms up black ahead

In my presence one dying person kept complaining that they would not
give him redhot nuts to gnaw  and only in the depths of his dimming
eyes was there throbbing and palpitating something like the wing of a
bird wounded unto death

HOW FAIR HOW FRESH WERE THE ROSES


Somewhere some time long long ago I read a poem I speedily forgot
it  but its first line lingered in my memory

How fair how fresh were the roses

It is winter now the windowpanes are coated with ice in the warm
chamber a single candle is burning I am sitting curled up in one
corner and in my brain there rings and rings

How fair how fresh were the roses

And I behold myself in front of the low window of a Russian house in the
suburbs The summer evening is melting and merging into night there is
a scent of mignonette and lindenblossoms abroad in the warm airand
in the window propped on a stiffened arm and with her head bent on her
shoulder sits a young girl gazing mutely and intently at the sky as
though watching for the appearance of the first stars How ingenuously
inspired are the thoughtful eyes how touchingly innocent are the
parted questioning lips how evenly breathes her bosom not yet fully
developed and still unagitated by anything how pure and tender are the
lines of the young face I do not dare to address her but how dear she
is to me how violently my heart beats

How fair how fresh were the roses

And in the room everything grows darker and darker The candle which
has burned low begins to flicker white shadows waver across the low
ceiling the frost creaks and snarls beyond the walland I seem to hear
a tedious senile whisper

How fair how fresh were the roses

Other images rise up before me I hear the merry murmur of family of
country life Two redgold little heads leaning against each other
gaze bravely at me with their bright eyes the red cheeks quiver with
suppressed laughter their hands are affectionately intertwined their
young kind voices ring out vying with each other and a little further
away in the depths of a snug room other hands also young are flying
about with fingers entangled over the keys of a poor little old piano
and the Lanner waltz cannot drown the grumbling of the patriarchal
samovr

How fair how fresh were the roses

The candle flares up and dies out Who is that coughing yonder so
hoarsely and dully Curled up in a ring my aged dog my sole companion
is nestling and quivering at my feet I feel cold I am shivering
 and they are all dead  all dead

How fair how fresh were the roses

A SEA VOYAGE


I sailed from Hamburg to London on a small steamer There were two of us
passengers I and a tiny monkey a female of the ouistiti breed which a
Hamburg merchant was sending as a gift to his English partner

She was attached by a slender chain to one of the benches on the deck
and threw herself about and squeaked plaintively like a bird

Every time I walked past she stretched out to me her black cold little
hand and gazed at me with her mournful almost human little eyesI
took her hand and she ceased to squeak and fling herself about

There was a dead calm The sea spread out around us in a motionless
mirror of leaden hue It seemed small a dense fog lay over it
shrouding even the tips of the masts and blinding and wearying the eyes
with its soft gloom The sun hung like a dim red spot in this gloom but
just before evening it became all aflame and glowed mysteriously and
strangely scarlet

Long straight folds like the folds of heavy silken fabrics flowed
away from the bow of the steamer one after another growing ever wider
wrinkling and broadening becoming smoother at last swaying and
vanishing The churned foam swirled under the monotonous beat of the
paddlewheels gleaming white like milk and hissing faintly it was
broken up into serpentlike ripples and then flowed together at a
distance and vanished likewise swallowed up in the gloom

A small bell at the stern jingled as incessantly and plaintively as the
squeaking cry of the monkey

Now and then a seal came to the surface and turning an abrupt
somersault darted off beneath the barelydisturbed surface

And the captain a taciturn man with a surly sunburned face smoked a
short pipe and spat angrily into the sea congealed in impassivity

To all my questions he replied with an abrupt growl I was compelled
willynilly to have recourse to my solitary fellowtravellerthe
monkey

I sat down beside her she ceased to whine and again stretched out her
hand to me

The motionless fog enveloped us both with a soporific humidity and
equally immersed in one unconscious thought we remained there side by
side like bloodrelatives

I smile now  but then another feeling reigned in me

We are all children of one motherand it pleased me that the poor
little beastie should quiet down so confidingly and nestle up to me as
though to a relative

N N


Gracefully and quietly dost thou walk along the path of life without
tears and without smiles barely animated by an indifferent attention

Thou art kind and clever  and everything is alien to theeand no one
is necessary to thee

Thou art very beautifuland no one can tell whether thou prizest thy
beauty or notThou art devoid of sympathy thyself and demandest no
sympathy

Thy gaze is profound and not thoughtful emptiness lies in that bright
depth

Thus do the stately shades pass by without grief and without joy in the
Elysian Fields to the dignified sounds of Glucks melodies

STAY


Stay As I now behold thee remain thou evermore in my memory

From thy lips the last inspired sound hath burst forththine eyes do
not gleam and flash they are dusky weighted with happiness with the
blissful consciousness of that beauty to which thou hast succeeded in
giving expressionof that beauty in quest of which thou stretchest
forth as it were thy triumphant thine exhausted hands

What light more delicate and pure than the sunlight hath been diffused
over all thy limbs over the tiniest folds of thy garments

What god with his caressing inflatus hath tossed back thy dishevelled
curls

His kiss burneth on thy brow grown pale as marble

Here it isthe open secret the secret of poetry of life of love
Here it is here it isimmortality There is no other immortalityand
no other is neededAt this moment thou art deathless

I will passand again thou art a pinch of dust a woman a child
But what is that to theeAt this moment thou hast become loftier than
all transitory temporal things thou hast stepped out of their
sphereThis thy moment will never end

Stay And let me be the sharer of thy immortality drop into my soul the
reflection of thine eternity

THE MONK


I used to know a monk a hermit a saint He lived on the sweetness of
prayer aloneand as he quaffed it he knelt so long on the cold floor
of the church that his legs below the knee swelled and became like
posts He had no sensation in them he kneltand prayed

I understood himand perhaps I envied him but let him also
understand me and not condemn meme to whom his joys are inaccessible

He strove to annihilate himself his hated ego but the fact that I do
not pray does not arise from selfconceit

My ego is perchance even more burdensome and repulsive to me than his
is to him

He found a means of forgetting himself  and I find a means to do the
same but not so constantly

He does not lie  and neither do I lie

WE SHALL STILL FIGHT ON


What an insignificant trifle can sometimes put the whole man back in
tune

Full of thought I was walking one day along the highway

Heavy forebodings oppressed my breast melancholy seized hold upon me

I raised my head Before me between two rows of lofty poplars the
road stretched out into the distance

Across it across that same road a whole little family of sparrows was
hopping hopping boldly amusingly confidently

One of them in particular fairly set his wings akimbo thrusting out his
crop and twittering audaciously as though the very devil was no match
for him A conquerorand that is all there is to be said

But in the meantime high up in the sky was soaring a hawk who
possibly was fated to devour precisely that same conqueror

I looked laughed shook myselfand the melancholy thoughts instantly
fled I felt daring courage a desire for life

And let my hawk soar over me if he will

We will still fight on devil take it

PRAYER


No matter what a man may pray for he is praying for a miracleEvery
prayer amounts to the following Great God cause that two and two may
not make four

Only such a prayer is a genuine prayer from a person to a person To
pray to the Universal Spirit to the Supreme Being of Kant of Hegelto
a purified amorphous God is impossible and unthinkable

But can even a personal living God with a form cause that two and two
shall not make four

Every believer is bound to reply He can and is bound to convince
himself of this

But what if his reason revolts against such an absurdity

In that case Shakspeare will come to his assistance There are many
things in the world friend Horatio and so forth

And if people retort in the name of truthall he has to do is to
repeat the famous question What is truth

And therefore let us drink and be merryand pray

THE RUSSIAN LANGUAGE


In days of doubt in days of painful meditations concerning the
destinies of my fatherland thou alone art my prop and my support O
great mighty just and free Russian languageWere it not for thee
how could one fail to fall into despair at the sight of all that goes on
at homeBut it is impossible to believe that such a language was not
bestowed upon a great people

 The word he used mytrstvo has a peculiar meaning It refers

committed during its earthly career If its good deeds alms prayers
and so forth added to the grace of God offset the evil the demons
are forced to renounce their claims These demons assault the soul in
relays each trial suffering or tribulation being a mytrstvo
One ancient authority enumerates twenty such trials The soul is
accompanied and defended in its trials by angels who plead its cause
Eventually they conduct it into the presence of God who then assigns
to it a temporary abode of bliss or woe until the day of judgment The
derivation of this curious and utterly untranslatable word is as
follows Mytr means a publican or taxgatherer As the publicans
under the Roman sway over the Jews indulged in various sorts of
violence abuses and inhuman conduct calling every one to strict
