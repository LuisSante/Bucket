PREFACE


The measure of a mans popularity is not alwaysor indeed seldomthe
measure of his intrinsic worth So when the earlier work of any writer
is gathered together in more enduring form catering to the enthusiasm
of his readers in his maturer years there is always a suspicion that
the venture is purely a commercial one without literary justification

Fortunately these stories of Mr Kiplings form their own best excuse
for this their first appearance together in book form Not merely
because in them may be traced the origin of that style and subject
matter that later made their author famous but because the stories are
in themselves worth whileworth writing worth reading The Likes o
Us is as true to the type as any of the immortal Mulvaney stories
the beginning of New Brooms is as succinctly fine as any prose Mr
Kipling ever wrote for searching out and presenting such splendid
pieces of fiction as Sleipner late Thurinda and A Little More
Beef to a public larger than their original one in India no apology
is necessary

ABAFT THE FUNNEL




ERASTASIUS OF THE WHANGHOA


The old cats tumbled down the ventilator sir and hes swearing away
under the furnacedoor in the stokehole said the second officer to
the Captain of the Whanghoa

Now what in thunder was Erastasius doing at the mouth of the
ventilator Its four feet from the ground and painted red at that
Any of the children been amusing themselves with him dyou think I
wouldnt have Erastasius disturbed in his inside for all the gold in
the treasury said the Captain Tell some one to bring him up and
handle him delicately for hes not a quiet beast

In three minutes a bucket appeared on deck It was covered with a
wooden lid Think he have make die this time said the Chinese sailor
who carried the coffin with a grin Catchee him topside coalsno
open eyeno spitno sclatchee my Have got bucket allee same and
make tight See

He dived his bare arm under the lid but withdrew it with a yell
dropping the bucket at the same time Hya Can do Maskee dlop
downmasky spilum coal Have catchee my light there

Blood was trickling from his elbow He moved aft while the bucket
mysteriously worked by hidden force trundled to and fro across the
decks swearing aloud

Emerged finally Erastasius tomcat and grandfatherinchief of the
Whanghoaa gaunt brindled beast lacking one ear with every hair on
his body armed and erect He was patched with coaldust very stiff and
sore all over and very anxious to take the world into his confidence
as to his wrongs For this reason he did not run when he was clear of
the bucket but sitting on his hunkers regarded the Captain as who
would say You hold a masters certificate and call yourself a seaman
and yet you allow this sort of thing on your boat

Guess I must apologise old man said the Captain gravely Those
ventilators are a little too broad in the beam for a passenger of your
build What made you walk down it Not a rat eh Youre too well fed
to trouble of rats Drink was it

Erastasius turned his back on the Captain He was a tailless Japanese
cat and the abruptness of his termination gave him a specially brusque
appearance

Shouldnt wonder if the old man hasnt been stealing something and
was getting away from the galley Hes the biggest reprobate that ever
shippedand thats saying something No he isnt my property exactly
Ive got a notion that he owns the ship Gathered that from the way he
goes round after six bells to see the lights out The chief engineer
says he built the engines Anyway the old man sits in the engineroom
and sort of keeps an eye on the boilers He was on the ship before I
joined herthats seven years ago when we were running up and down
and around and about the China Seas

Erastasius his back to the company was busied in cleaning his
disarranged fur He licked and swore alternately The ventilator
incident had hurt his feelings sorely

He knows we are talking about him continued the Captain Hes a
responsible kind o critter Thats natural when you come to think that
he has saved a quarter of a million of dollars At present his wants
are fewguess he would like a netting over those ventilators first
thingbut some day hell begin to live up to his capital

Saved a quarter of a million dollars What securities did he invest
em in said a man from Foochow

Here in this bottom He saved the Whanghoa with a full cargo of
tea silk and opium and thirteen thousand dollars in bar silver
Yes thats about the extent of the old mans savings I commanded
The old man was the rescuer and I was more grateful to him cause
it was my darned folly that nearly brought us into the trouble I was
new to these waters new to the Chinaman and his fascinating little
ways being a New England man by raising Erastasius was raised by the
Devil Thats who his sire was Never ran across his dam Ran across a
forsaken sea though in the Whanghoa a little to the northeast of
this with eight hundred steerage passengers all Chinamen for various
and undenominated ports Had the pleasure of sending eighteen of em
into the water Yes thats so isnt it old man

Erastasius finished licking himself and mewed affirmatively

Yes we carried four white officersa Westerner two Vermont men and
myself There were ten Americans a couple of Danes and a halfcaste
knocking round the ship and the crew were Chinese but most of em
good Chinese Only good Chinese I ever met We had our steerage
passengers tweendecks Most of em lay around and played dominoes or
smoked opium We had bad weather at the start and the steerage were
powerful sick I judged they would have no insides to them when the
weather lifted so I didnt put any guards on them Wanted all my men
to work the ship Engines rotten as Congress and under sail half the
time Next time I carry Chinese steerage trash Ill hire a Gatling and
mount it on the tweendecks hatch

We were fooling about between islandsabout a hundred and fifty
thousand islands all wrapped up in fog When the fog laid the wind
the engines broke down One of the passengerswe carried no ladies
that journeycame to me one evening I calculate theres a conspiracy
tweendecks he said Those pigtails are talking together No good
ever came of pigtails talking Im from Frisco I authoritate on
these matters Not on this ship I said Ive no use for duplicate
authority Youll be homesick after nine this time tomorrow he
said and quit I guess he told the other passengers his notions

Erastasius shared my cabin in general I didnt care to dispute
with a cat that went heeled the way he did That particular night
when I came down he was not inclined for repose When I shut the door
he scrabbled till I let him out When he was out he scrabbled to
come back When he was back he jumped all round the shanty yowling
I stroked him and the sparks irrigated his back as if twas the
smokestack of a river steamer Ill get you a wife old man I
said next voyage It is no good for you to be alone with me
Whoopee yoopeeyawawaw said Erastasius Let me get out of
this I looked him square between the eyes to fix the place where
Id come down with a bootheel he was getting monotonous and as I
looked I saw the animal was just possessed with deadly fearhuman
fearcrawling shaking fear It crept out of the green of his eyes
and crept over me in billowing waveseach wave colder than the last
Unburden your mind Erastasius I said Whats going to happen
Wheepeeyeepeeyayayawoop said Erastasius backing to the door
and scratching

I quit my cabin sweating big drops and somehow my hand shut on my
sixshooter The grip of the handle soothes a man when he is afraid I
heard the whole ship tweendecks rustling under me like all the woods
of Maine when the winds up The lamp over the tweendecks was out
The steerage watchman was lying on the ground and the whole hive of
Celestials were on the trampsoftfooted hounds A lantern came down
the alleyway Behind it was the passenger that had spoken to me and
all the rest of the crowd except the halfcaste

Are you homesick any now said my passenger The tweendecks woke
up with a yell at the light and some one fired up the hatchway
Then we began our share of the funthe ten passengers and I Eleven
sixshooters That cleared the first rush of the pigtails but we
continued firing on principle working our way down the steps No one
came down from the spardeck to assist though I heard considerable of
a trampling The pigtails below were growling like cats I heard the
lookout man shout Junk on the port bow and the bell ring in the
engineroom for full speed ahead Then we struck something and there
was a yell inside and outside the ship that would have lifted your
hair out When the outside yell stopped our pigtails were on their
faces Run down a junk said my passengertheir junk He loosed
three shots into the steerage on the strength of it I went up on deck
when things were quiet below Some one had run our Dahlgren signalgun
forward and pointed it to the break of the focsle There was the
balance of a war junkthree spars and a head or two on the water and
the first mate keeping his watch in regular style

What is your share he said Weve smashed up a junk that tried to
foul us Seems to have affected the feelings of your friends below
Guess they wanted to make connection It is made said I on the
Glassy Sea Wheres the watch In the focsle The halfcaste is
sitting on the signalgun smoking his cigar The watch are speculatin
whether hell stick the businessend of it in the touchhole or
continue smoking I gather that gun is not empty Send em down below
to wash decks Tell the quartermaster to go through their boxes while
they are away They may have implements

The watch went below to clean things up There were eighteen stiff
uns and fourteen with holes through their systems Some died some
survived I did not keep particular count The balance I roped up and
it employed most of our spare rigging When we touched port there was a
picnic among the hangmen Seems that Erastasius had been yowling down
the cabins all night before he came to me and kept the passengers
alive The man that spoke to me said the old mans eyes were awful
to look at He was dying to tell his fear but couldnt When the
passengers came forward with the light the halfcaste quit for topside
and got the quartermaster to load the signalgun with handspikes and
bring it forward in case the focsle wished to assist in the row
That was the best halfcaste I ever met But the focsle didnt
assist They were sick So were the men belowhorrorsick That was
the way the old man saved the Whanghoa

HER LITTLE RESPONSIBILITY

And No Man May Answer for the Soul of His Brother


It was two in the morning and Epstins Dive was almost empty when
a Thing staggered down the steps that led to that horrible place and
fawned on me disgustingly for the price of a drink Im dying of
thirst he said but his tone was not that of a street loafer There
is a freemasonry the freemasonry of the public schools stronger than
any that the Craft knows The Thing drank whisky raw which in itself
is not calculated to slake thirst and I waited at its side because
I knew by virtue of the one sentence above recorded that it once
belonged to my caste Indeed so small is the world when one begins
to travel round it that for aught I knew I might even have met
the Thing in that menagerie of carefullytrained wild beasts Decent
Society And the Thing drank more whisky ere the floodgates of its
speech were loosed and spoke of the wonderful story of its fall

Never man he said had suffered more than he or for slighter sin
Whereat I winked beerily into the bottom of my empty glass having
heard that tale before I think the Thing had been long divided
from all social and moral restrainteven longer from the wholesome
influence of soap and water

What I feel most down here said It and by down here I presume he
meant the Inferno of his own wretchedness is the difficulty about
getting a bath A man can always catch a free lunch at any of the
bars in the city if he has money enough to buy a drink with and you
can sleep out for six or eight months of the year without harm but
San Francisco doesnt run to free baths Its not an amusing life any
way you look at it Im more or less used to things but it hurts me
even now to meet a decent man who knows something of life in the old
country I was raised at HarrowHarrow if you pleaseand Im not
fiveandtwenty yet and I havent got a penny and I havent got a
friend and there is nothing in creation that I can command except a
drink and I have to beg for that Have you ever begged for a drink
It hurts at first but you get used to it My fathers a parson I
dont think he knows I beg drink He lives near Salisbury Do you know
Salisbury at all And then theres my mother too But I have not heard
from either of them for a couple of years They think Im in a real
estate office in Washington Territory coining money hand over fist
If ever you run across themI suppose you will some daytheres the
address Tell them that youve seen me and that I am well and fit
Understandwell and fit I guess Ill be dead by the time you see
em Thats hard Men oughtnt to die at fiveandtwentyof drink
Say were you ever mashed on a girl Not one of these you see girls
out here but an English onethe sort of girl one meets at the
Vicarage tennisparty dont you know A girl of our own set I dont
mean mashed exactly but dead clean gone head over ears and worse
than that I was once and I fancy I took the thing pretty much as I
take liquor now I didnt know when to stop It didnt seem to me
that there was any reason for stopping in affairs of that kind Im
quite sure theres no reason for stopping halfway with liquor Go the
whole hog and die Its all right thoughIm not going to get drunk
here Five in the morning will suit me just as well and I havent the
chance of talking to one of you fellows often So you cut about in fine
clothes do you and take your drinks at the best bars and put up at
the Palace All Englishmen do Well heres luck you may be what I
am one of these days Youll find companions quite as well raised as
yourself

                                   

But about this girl Dont do what I did I fell in love with her She
lived near us in Salisbury that was when I had a clean shirt every day
and hired horses to ride One of the guineas I spent on that amusement
would keep me for a week here But about this girl I dont think some
men ought to be allowed to fall in love any more than they ought to be
allowed to taste whisky She said she cared for me Used to say that
about a thousand times a day with a kiss in between I think about
those things now and they make me nearly as drunk as the whisky does
Do you know anything about that lovemaking business I stole a copy
of Cleopatra off a bookstall in Kearney Street and that priestchap
says a very true thing about it You cant stop when its once started
and when its all over you cant give it up at the word of command I
forget the precise language That girl cared for me Id give something
if she could see me now She doesnt like men without collars and odd
boots and somebody elses hat but anyhow she made me what I am and
some day shell know it I came out here two years ago to a real estate
office my father bought me some sort of a place in the firm We were
all Englishmen but we were about a match for an average Yankee but I
forgot to tell you I was engaged to the girl before I came out Never
you make a woman swear oaths of eternal constancy Shell break every
one of them as soon as her mind changes and call you unjust for making
her swear them I worked enough for five men in my first year I got
a little house and lot in Tacoma fit for any woman I never drank I
hardly ever smoked I sold real estate all day and wrote letters at
night She wrote letters too about as full of affection as they make
em You can tell nothing from a womans letter though If they want
to hide anything they just double the dears and darlings and then
giggle when the man fancies himself deceived

I dont suppose I was worse off than hundreds of others but it seems
to me that she might have had the grace to let me down easily She
went and got married I dont suppose she knew exactly what she was
doing because I got the letters just the same six weeks after she was
married It was an odd copy of an English paper that showed me what had
happened It came in on the same day as one of her letters telling me
she would be true to the gates of death Sounds like a novel doesnt
it But it did not amuse me in the least I wasnt constructed to pitch
the letters into the fire and pick up with a Yankee girl I wrote her a
letter I rather wish I could remember what was in that letter Then I
went to a bar in Tacoma and had some whisky about a gallon I suppose
If I had anything approaching to a word of honour about me I would
give it you that I did not know what happened until I was told that my
partnership with the firm had been dissolved and that the house and
lot did not belong to me any more I would have left the firm and sold
the house anyhow but the crash sobered me for about three days Then
I started another jamboree I might have got back after the first one
and been a prominent citizen but the second bust settled matters Then
I began to slide on the downgrade straight off and here I am now
I could write you a book about what I have come through if I could
remember it The worst of it is I can see that she wasnt worth losing
anything in life for but Ive lost just everything and Im like the
priestchap in CleopatraI cant get over what I remember If she had
let me down easy and given me warning I should have been awfully cut
up for a time but I should have pulled through She didnt do that
though She lied to me all along and married a curate and I dare say
shell be a virtuous shevicar later on but the little affair broke me
dead and if I had more whisky in me I should be blubbering like a calf
all round this Dive That would have disgusted you wouldnt it

Yes said I

A MENAGERIE ABOARD


It was pyjama time on the Madura in the Bay of Bengal and the
incense of the very early morning cigar went up to the stainless skies
Every one knows pyjama timethe long hour that follows the removal
of the beds from the saloon skylight and the consumption of chota
hazri Most men know too that the choicest stories of many seas
may be picked up thenfrom the longwinded histories of the Colonial
sheepmaster to the crisp anecdotes of the Californian from tales of
battle murder and sudden death told by the Burmahreturned subaltern
to the bland drivel of the globetrotter The Captain tastefully
attired in pale pink sat up on the signalgun and tossed the husk of a
banana overboard

It looked in through my cabinwindow said he and scared me nearly
into a fit We had just been talking about a monkey who appeared to
a man in an omnibus and haunted him till he cut his own throat The
apparition amid howls of incredulity was said to have been the result
of excessive teadrinking The Captains apparition promised to be
better

It was a menageriea whole turnout lock stock and barrel from the
big bear to the little hippopotamus and you can guess the size of it
from the fact that they paid us a thousand pounds in freight only We
got them all accommodated somewhere forward among the deck passengers
and they whooped up terribly all along the ship for two or three days
Among other things such as panthers and leopards there were sixteen
giraffes and we moored em fore and aft as securely as might be but
you cant get a purchase on a giraffe somehow He slopes back too much
from the bows to the stern We were running up the Red Sea I think
and the menagerie fairly quiet One night I went to my cabin not
feeling well About midnight I was waked by something breathing on my
face I was quite calm and collected for I had got it into my head
that it was one of the panthers or at least the bear and I reached
back to the rack behind me for a revolver Then the head began to slide
against my cabinall across itand I said to myself Its the big
python But I looked into its eyesthey were beautiful eyesand saw
it was one of the giraffes Tell you though a giraffe has the eyes of
a sorrowful nun and this creature was just brimming over with liquid
tenderness The sevenfoot neck rather spoilt the effect but Ill
always recollect those eyes

Say did you kiss the critter demanded the orchidhunter en route to
Siam

No I remembered that it was darn valuable and I didnt want to lose
freight on it I was afraid it would break its neck drawing its head
out of my windowI had a big deck cabin of courseso I shoved it out
softly like a hen and the head slid out with those Mary Magdalene
eyes following me to the last Then I heard the quartermaster calling
on heaven and earth for his lost giraffe and then the row began all
up and down the decks The giraffe had sense enough to duck its head to
avoid the awningswe were awned from bow to sternbut it clattered
about like a sick cow the quartermaster jumping after it and it
swinging its long neck like a flail Catch it and hold it said the
quartermaster Catch a typhoon said I Shes going overboard The
spotted fool had heaved one foot over the stern railings and was trying
to get the other to follow It was so happy at getting its head into
the open I thought it would have crowedI dont know whether giraffes
crow but it heaved up its neck for all the world like a crowing cock
Come back to your stable yelled the quartermaster grabbing hold of
the brutes tail

I was nearly helpless with laughing though I knew if the concern
went over it would be no laughing matter for me Well by good luck
she came roundthe quartermaster was a strong man at a ropes end
First of all she slewed her neck round and I could see those tender
loving eyes under the stars sort of saying Cruel man What are you
doing to my tail Then the foot came on board and she bumped herself
up under the awning looking ready to cry with disappointment The
funniest thing was she didnt make any noisea pig would ha roused
the ship in no timeonly every time she dropped her foot on the deck
it was like firing a revolver the hoofs clicked so We headed her
towards the bows back to her mooringsjust like a policeman showing
a shortsighted old woman over a crossing The quartermaster sweated
and panted and swore but she never said anythingonly whacked her
old head despairingly against the awning and the funnel case Her feet
woke up the whole ship and by the time we had her fairly moored fore
and aft the population in their nightgear were giving us advice Then
we took up a yard or two in all the moorings and turned in No other
animal got loose that voyage though the old lady looked at me most
reproachfully every time I came that way and Youve blasted my young
and tender innocence was the expression of her eyes It was all the
quartermasters fault for hauling her tail I wonder she didnt kick
him open Well of course that isnt much of a yarn but I remember
once in the city of Venice we had a Malayan tapir loose on the deck
and we had to lasso him It was this way

Guzl thyar hai said the steward and I fled down the companion and
missed the tale of the tapir

A SMOKE OF MANILA


The man from Manila held the floor Much care had made him very lean
and pale and holloweyed Added to which he smoked the cigars of his
own country and they were bad for the constitution He foisted his
Stinkadores Magnificosas and his Cuspidores Imperiallissimos upon all
who would accept them and wondered that the recipients of his bounty
turned away and were sad There is nothing said he like a Manila
cigar And the pink pyjamas and blue pyjamas and the spotted green
pyjamas all fluttering gracefully in the morning breeze vowed that
there was not and never would be

Do the Spaniards smoke these vile brands to any extent asked the
Young Gentleman travelling for Pleasure as he inspected a fresh box of
Oysters of the East Smoke em said the man from Manila they do
nothing else day and night Ah said the Young Gentleman travelling
for Pleasure in the low voice of one who has received mortal injury
that accounts for the administration of the country being what it is
After a man has tried a couple of these things he would be ready for
any crime

The man from Manila took no heed of the insult I knew a case once
said he when a cigar saved a man from the sin of burglary and landed
him in quod for five years Was he trying to kill the man who gave
him the cigar said the Young Gentleman travelling for Pleasure No
it was this way My firms godowns stand close to a creek That is to
say the creek washes one face of them and there are a few things
in those godowns that might be useful to a man such as piecegoods
and cotton printsperhaps five thousand dollars worth I happened
to be walking through the place one day when for a miracle I was
not smoking That was two years ago Great Csar then he has been
smoking ever since murmured the Young Gentleman travelling for
Pleasure

Was not smoking continued the man from Manila I had no business in
the godowns They were a short cut to my house When halfway through
them I fancied I saw a little curl of smoke rising from behind one of
the bales We stack our bales on low saddles much as ricks are stacked
in England My first notion was to yell I object to fire in godowns on
principle It is expensive whatever the insurance may do Luckily I
sniffed before I shouted and I sniffed good tobacco smoke And this
was in Manila you say interrupted the Young Gentleman travelling for
Pleasure

Yes in the only place in the world where you get good tobacco I knew
we had no bales of the weed in stock and I suspected that a man who
got behind print bales to finish his cigar might be worth looking up I
walked between the bales till I reached the smoke It was coming from
the ground under one of the saddles Thats enough I thought and I
went away to get a couple of the Guarda Civilepolicemen in fact I
knew if there was anything to be extracted from my friend the bobbies
would do it A Spanish policeman carries in the daytime nothing more
than a sixshooter and machete a dirk At night he adorns himself
with a repeating rifle which he fires on the slightest provocation
Well when the policemen arrived they poked my friend out of his
hidingplace with their dirks hauled him out by the hair and kicked
him round the godown once or twice just to let him know that he had
been discovered They then began to question him and under gentle
pressureI thought he would be pulped into a jelly but a Spanish
policeman always knows when to leave offhe made a clean breast of the
whole business He was part of a gang and was to lie in the godown all
that night At twelve oclock a boat manned by his confederates was to
drop down the creek and halt under the godown windows while he was
to hand out our bales That was their little plan He had lain there
about three hours and then he began to smoke I dont think he noticed
what he was doing smoking is just like breathing to a Spaniard He
could not understand how he had betrayed himself and wanted to know
whether he had left a leg sticking out under the saddles Then the
Guarda Civile lambasted him all over again for trifling with the
majesty of the law and removed him after full confession

I put one of my own men under a saddle with instructions to hand out
print bales to anybody who might ask for them in the course of the
night Meantime the police made their own arrangements which were very
comprehensive

At midnight a lumbering old barge big enough to hold about a hundred
bales came down the creek and pulled up under the godown windows
exactly as if she had been one of my own barges The eight ruffians
in her whistled all the national airs of Manila as a signal to the
confederate then cooling his heels in the lockup But my man was
ready He opened the window and held quite a long confab with these
secondhand pirates They were all halfbreeds and Roman Catholics
and the way they called upon all the blessed saints to assist them in
their work was edifying My man began tilting out the bales quite as
quickly as the confederate would have done Only he stopped to giggle
now and again and they spat and swore at him like cats That made him
worse and at last he dropped yelling with laughter over the half door
of the godown goods window Then one boat came up stream and another
down stream and caught the barge stem and stern Four Guarda Civiles
were in each boat consequently eight repeating rifles were pointed
at the barge which was very nicely loaded with our bales The pirates
called on the saints more fluently than ever threw up their hands and
threw themselves on their stomachs That was the safest attitude and
it gave them the chance of cursing their luck the barge the godown
the Guarda Civile and every saint in the calendar They cursed the
saints most for the Guarda Civile thumped em when their remarks
became too personal We made them put all the bales back again Then
they were handed over to justice and got five years apiece If they had
any dollars they would get out the next day If they hadnt they would
serve their full time and no ticketofleave allowed Thats the whole
story

And the only case on record said the Young Gentleman travelling for
Pleasure where a Manila cigar was of any use to any one The man
from Manila lit a fresh Cuspidore and went down to his bath

THE RED LAMP


A strong situationvery strong sirquite the strongest one in the
play in fact

What play said a voice from the bottom of the long chair under the
bulwarks

The Red Lamp

Oh

Conversation ceased and there was an industrious sucking of cheroots
for the space of half an hour before the company adjourned to the
cardroom It was decidedly a night for sleeping on deckwarm as the
Red Sea and more moist than Bengal Unfortunately every square foot
of the deck seemed to be occupied by earlier comers and in despair I
removed myself to the extreme focsle where the anchorchains churn
rustdyed water from the hawseholes and the lascars walk about with
slushpots

The throb of the engines reached this part of the world as a muffled
breathing which might be easily mistaken for the snoring of the
ships cow Occasionally one of the fowls in the coops waked and
cheeped dismally as she thought of tomorrows entres in the saloon
but otherwise all was very very still for the hour was two in the
morning when the crew of a ship are not disposed to be lively None
came to bear me company save the bosuns pet kittens and they were
impolite From where I lay I could look over the whole length of
awning ghostly white in the dark and by their constant fluttering
judged that the ship was pitching considerably The focsle swung up
and down like an uneasy hydraulic lift and a few showers of spray
found their passage through the hawseholes from time to time

Have you ever felt that maddening sense of incompetence which follows
on watching the work of another mans office The civilian is at
home among his despatchboxes and files of pending cases How in
the world does he do it asks the military man The budding officer
can arrange for the movements of two hundred men across country
Incomprehensible says the civilian And so it is with all alien
employs from our own So it was with me I knew that I was lying among
all the materials out of which Clark Russell builds his books of the
seathe rush through the night the gouts of foam the singing of the
wind in the rigging overhead and the black mystery of the waterbut
for the life of me I could make nothing of them all

 A topsail royal flying free
 A bit of canvas was to me
 And it was nothing more

Oh that a man should have but one poor little life and one incomplete
set of experiences to crowd into it I sighed as the bells of the ship
lulled me to sleep and the lookout man crooned a dreary song

I slept far into the night for the clouds gathered over the sky the
stars died out and all grew as black as pitch But we never slackened
speed we beat the foam to left and right with clanking of chains
rattling of bowports and savage noises of ripping and rending from
the cutwater ploughing up to the luminous seabeasts I was roused by
the words of the man in the smokingroom A strong situation sir
very strongquite the strongest in the play in factThe Red Lamp
y know

I thought over the sentence lazily for a time and thensurely there
was a red lamp in the air somewherean intolerable glare that singed
the shut eyelids I opened my eyes and looked forward The lascar was
asleep his face bowed on his knees though he ought to have been
roused by the hum of a rapidly approaching city by the noises of men
and women talking and laughing and drinking I could hear it not half a
mile away it was strange that his ears should be closed

The night was so black that one could hardly breathe and yet where
did the glare from the red lamp come from Not from our ship she was
silent and asleepthe officers on the bridge were asleep there was
no one of four hundred souls awake but myself And the glare of the
red lamp went up to the zenith Small wonder A quarter of a mile in
front of us rolled a big steamer under full steam and she was heading
down on us without a word of warning Would the lookout man never look
out Would their crew be as fast asleep as ours It was impossible for
the other ship hummed with populous noises and there was the defiant
tinkle of a piano rising above all She should have altered her course
or blown a foghorn

I held my breath while an eternity went by counted out by the
throbbing of my heart and the engines I knew that it was my duty
to call but I knew also that no one could hear me Moreover I was
intensely interested in the approaching catastrophe interested you
will understand as one whom it did in no wise concern By the light
of the luminous sea thrown forward in sheets under the forefoot of
the advancing steamer I could discern the minutest details of her
structure from cathead to bridge Abaft the bridge she was crowded
with merrymakersseemed to be in fact a P  O vessel given up to a
ball I wondered as I leaned over the bulwarks what they would say when
the crash camewhether they would shriek very loudlywhether the men
and women would try to rush to our decks or whether we would rush on
to theirs It would not matter in the least for at the speed we were
driving both vessels would go down together locked through the deeps
of the sea It occurred to me then that the sea would be cold and
that instead of choking decently I might be one in a mad rush for the
boatsmight be crippled by a falling spar or wrenched plate and left
on the heeling decks to die Then Terror came to meFear gross and
overwhelming as the bulk of the nightDespair unrelieved by a single
ray of hope

We were not fifty yards apart when the passengers on the stranger
caught sight of us and shrieked aloud I saw a man pick up his child
from one of the benches and futilely attempt to climb the rigging Then
we closedher nameplate ten feet above ours looking down into our
forehatch I heard the grinding as of a hundred querns the ripping of
the tough bowplates and the pistollike report of displaced rivets
followed by the rush of the sea We were sinking in midocean

                                   

Beg y pardon said the quartermaster shaking me by the arm but
you must have been sleeping in the moonlight for the last two hours
and thats not good for the eyes Didnt seem to make you sleep easy
either I opened my eyes heavily My face was swollen and aching for
on my forehead lay the malignant splendour of the moon The glare of
the Red Lamp had vanished with the brilliantlylighted ship but the
ghastly shrieks of her drowning crew continued

Whats that I asked tremulously of the quartermaster Was it real

Pork chops in the saloon tomorrow said the quartermaster The
butcher he got up at four bells to put the old squeaker out of the way
Thems his dying ejaculations

I dragged my bedding aft and went to sleep

THE SHADOW OF HIS HAND


I come from San Jos he said San Jos Calaveras County
California thats my place I pricked up my ears at the mention of
Calaveras County Bret Harte has made that sacred ground

Yes said I politely Always be polite to a gentleman from Calaveras
County For aught you know he may be a lineal descendant of the great
Colonel Starbottle

Did you ever know Vermilyea of San Luis Obispo continued the
stranger chewing the plug of meditation

No said I Heaven alone knows where lies San Luis Obispo but I was
not going to expose my ignorance Besides there might be a story at
the back of it all What was the special weakness of Mister Vermilyea

Vermilyea He weak Lot Vermilyea never had a weakness that you might
call a weakness until subsequent events transpired Then that weakness
developed into White Rye All Westerners drink White Rye On the
Eastern coast they drink Bourbon Lot tried both when his heart was
broken Bothby the quart

Dyou happen to remember what broke his heart I said

This must be your first trip to the States sir or you would
know that Lots heart was broken by his fatherinlaw Lots
congregationhe took to Religionalways said that he had no business
fooling with a fatherinlaw A good many other people said that too
But I always adhered to Lot Why dont you kill the animal Lot I
used to say I cant Hes the father of my wife Lot used to say
Loan him money then and settle him on the other side of the States I
used to say The old clam wont move Lot used to say

Half a minute What was the actual trouble between Vermilyea and his
fatherinlaw Did he borrow money

Im coming to that said the stranger calmly It arrived this way
Lot had a notion to get married Some men get that idea He went to
Frisco and pawned out his heartLot had a most feeling heart and
that was his ruinto a girl who lived at back of Kearney Street Ive
forgotten her given name but the old mans name was Dougherty Guess
he was a naturalised Irishman The old man did not see the merits of
Lot when he went sparking after the girl evenings He fired Lot out off
the stoop three or four times Lot didnt hit him because he was fond
of the daughter He just quit like a lamb the old man welting into him
with anything that came handysticks and besoms and such Lot endured
that being a tough man Every time Lot was fired out he would wait
till the old man was pretty well pumped out Then he used to turn round
and say Whens the wedding to be Dougherty used to ramp round Lot
while the girl hid herself till the breeze abated He had a peculiar
aversion to domiciliary visits from Lot had Dougherty Ive my own
theory on the subject Ill explain it later on At last Dougherty got
tired of Lot and his peacefulness The girl stuck to him for all she
was worth Lot never budged If you want to marry her said the old
man just drop your longsuffering for half an hour Stand up to me
Lot and well run this thing through with our hands If I must I
must said Lot and with that they began the argument up and down the
parlour floor Lot he was fighting for his wife He set considerable
value on the girl The old man he was fighting for the fun of the
affair Lot whipped He handled the old man tenderly out of regard
for his connections All the same he fixed him up pretty thoroughly
When he crawled off the old man he had received his permission to
marry the girl Old man Dougherty ran round Frisco advertising Lot
for the tallest fighter in the town Lot was a respectable sort of man
and considerable absorbed in preparing for his wedding It didnt
please him any to receive invitations from the boss fighting men of
Friscoprofessional invitations you must understand I guess he
cussed the fatherinlaw to be

When he was married he concluded to locate in Frisco and started
business there A married man dont keep his muscle up any Old man
Dougherty he must have counted on that By the time Lots first child
was born he came around suffering for a fight He painted Lots house
crimson Lot endured that He got a hold of the baby and began yanking
it around by the legs to see if it could squeal worth listening to
Lot stretched him Old man howled with delight Lot couldnt well
hand his fatherinlaw over to the police so they had it knuckle
and tooth all round the front floor and the old man he quit by the
window considerably mashed up Lot was fair spent not having kept up
his muscle My notion is that old man Dougherty being a boss fighter
couldnt get his fighting regularly till Lot married into the family
Then he reckoned on a running discussion to warm up his bones Lot was
too fond of his wife to disoblige him Any man in his senses would have
brought the old man before the courts or clubbed him or laid him out
stiff But Lot was always tenderhearted

Soon as old man Dougherty got his senses together off the pavement
he argued that Lot was considerable less of a fighter than he had
been That pleased the old man He was plastered and caulked up by
the doctors and as soon as he could move he interviewed Lot and made
remarks Lot didnt much care what he said but when he came to casting
reflections on the parentage of the baby Lot shut the office door and
played round for half an hour till the walls glittered like the evening
sun Old man Dougherty crawled out but he crowed as he crawled
Praise the blessed saints he said I kin get my fighting along o
my meals Lot ye have prolonged my life a century

Guess Lot would like to see him dead now He is an old man but most
amazing tough He has been fighting Lot for a matter of three years
If Lot made a lucky bit of trade the old man would come along and
fight him for luck If Lot lost a little the old man would fight him
to teach him safe speculation It took all Lots time to keep even with
him No man in business can tend his business and fight in streaks
Lots trade fell off every time he laid himself out to stretch the old
man Worst of it was that when Lot was made a Deacon of his church the
old man fought him most terrible for the honour of the Roman Catholic
Church Lot whipped of course He always whipped Old man Dougherty
went round among the other Deacons and lauded Lot for a boss pugilist
not meaning to hurt Lots prospects Lot had to explain the situation
to the church in general They accepted it

Old man Dougherty he fought on Age had no effect on him Lot always
whipped but nothing would satisfy the old man Lot shook all his teeth
out till his gums were as bare as a sandbar Old man Dougherty came
along lisping his invitation to the dance They fought

When Lot shifted to San Luis Obispo old man Dougherty he came along
toocraving for his fight It was cocktails and plug to him It
grew on him Lot handled him too gently because of the wife The old
man could come to the scratch once a month and always at the most
inconvenient time They fought

Last I heard of Lot he was sinking into the tomb Its not the
fighting he said to me Its the darned monotony of the circus He
knows I can whip him but he wont rest satisfied Lay him out Lot
said I fracture his cranium or gouge him This show is foolish all
round I cant lay him out said Lot Hes my fatherinlaw But
dont it strike you Ive a deal to be thankful for If he had been a
Jew hed have fought on Sundays when I was doing Deacon Ive been too
gentle with him the old man knows my spot place but Ive a deal to be
thankful for

Strikes me that thankfulness of Lots sort is nothing more nor less
than cussed affectation Say

I said nothing

A LITTLE MORE BEEF


A little more beef please said the fat man with the grey whiskers
and the spattered waistcoat You cant eat too much o good beefnot
even when the prices are going up hoof over hock And he settled
himself down to load in a fresh cargo

Now this is how the fat man had come by his meal One thousand miles
away a red Texan steer was preparing to go to bed for the night in the
company of his fellowsmyriads of his fellows From dawn till late
dusk he had loafed across the leagues of grass and grunted savagely as
each mouthful proved to his mind that grass was not what he had known
it in his youth But the steer was wrong That summer had brought great
drought to Montana and Northern Dakota The cattle feed was withering
day by day and the more prudent stock owners had written to the East
for manufactured provender Only the little cactus that grows with the
grasses appeared to enjoy itself The cattle certainly did not and the
cowboys from the very beginning of spring had used language considered
profane even for the cowboy What their ponies said has never been
recorded The ponies had the worst time of all and at each nightly
camp whispered to each other their longings for the winter when
they would be turned out on the freezing rangesgalled from wither
to croup but riderlessthank Heaven riderless On these various
miseries the sun looked down impartial His business was to cake the
ground and ruin the grasses

The cattlethe acres of huddled cattlewere restless In the first
place they were forced to scatter for graze and in the second the
heat told on their tempers and made them prod each other with their
long horns In the heart of the herd you would have thought men were
fighting with singlesticks On the outskirts posted at quartermile
intervals sat the cowboys on their ponies the brims of their hats
tilted over their sunskinned noses their feet out of the big
brownleather hooded stirrups and their hands gripping the horn of the
heavy saddle to keep themselves from falling on to the groundasleep
A cowboy can sleep at full gallop on the other hand he can keep
awake also at full gallop for eight and forty hours and wear down six
unamiable bronchos in the process

Lafe Parmalee Shwink the German who could not ride but had a blind
affection for cattle from the brandingyard to the butchers block
Michigan so called because he said he came from California but spoke
not the Californian tongue Jim from San Diego to distinguish him
from other Jims and The Corpse were the outposts of the herd The
Corpse had won his name from a statement made in the fulness of much
McBrayer whisky that he had once been a graduate of Corpus Christi He
spoke truth but to the wrong audience The inhabitants of the Elite
Saloon after several attempts to get the hang of the name dubbed the
speaker The Corpse and as long as he cinched a broncho or jingled a
spur within four hundred miles of Livingstonyea far in the south
even to the unexplored borders of the sheepeater Indianshe was known
by that unlovely name How he had passed from college to cattle no man
knew and according to the etiquette of the West no man asked He was
not by any means a tenderfoothad no unmanly weakness for washing
did not in the least object to appearing at the wild and wonderful
reunions held nightly in Miss Minnies parlour whose flaring
advertisement did not in the least disturb the proprieties of Wachoma
Junction and in common with his associates was when drunk ready
to shoot at anything or anybody He was not proud He had condescended
to take in hand and educate a young and promising Chicago drummer who
by evil fate had wandered into that wilderness where all his cunning
was of no account and from that youths quivering handoutstretched
by commandhad shot away the top of a wineglass The Corpse was
recognised in the freemasonry of the craft as one of the CMRs
boys and tough at that

The CMR controlled much cattle and their slaughterhouses in
Chicago bubbled the blood of beeves all day long Their saltbeef fed
the sailor on the sea and their iced best firsts the housekeeper
in the London suburbs Not even the firm knew how many cowboys they
employed but all the firm knew that on the fourteenth day of July
their stockyards at Wachoma Junction were to be filled with two
thousand head of cattle ready for immediate shipment to Chicago while
prices yet ruled high and before the grass had withered utterly
Lafe Michigan Jim The Corpse and the others knew this too and were
heartily glad of it because they would be paid up in Chicago for their
halfyears work and would then do their best towards painting that
town in purest vermilion They would get drunk they would gamble and
would otherwise enjoy themselves till they were broke and then they
would hire out again

The sun dropped behind the rolling hills and the cattle halted for
the night cheered and cooled by a little wandering breeze The red
steers mother had been caught in a hailstorm five years ago Till she
went the way of all cowflesh she missed no opportunity of telling her
son to beware of the hot day and the cold wind that does not know its
own mind When it blows five ways at once said she and makes your
horns feel creepy get away my son Follow the timehonoured instinct
of our tribe and run I ranshe looked ruefully at the scars on her
sidebut that was in a barbwire country and it hurt me None the
less run The red steer chewed his cud and the little wind out of
the darkness played round his hornsall five ways at once The cowboys
lifted up their voices in unmelodious song that the cattle might know
where they were and began slowly walking round the recumbent herd Do
anybodys horns feel creepy queried the red steer of his neighbours
My mother told meand he repeated the tale to the edification of
the yearlings and the threeyearolds breathing heavily at his side

The song of the cowboys rose higher The cattle bowed their heads
Their men were at hand They were safe Something had happened to
the quiet stars They were dying out one by one and the wind was
freshening Bless my hoofs muttered a yearling my horns are
beginning to feel creepy Softly the red steer lifted himself from
the ground Come away quoth he to the yearling Come away to the
outskirts and well move My mother said The innocent fool
followed and a white heifer saw them move Being a woman she naturally
bellowed Timber wolves and ran forward blindly into a dun steer
dreaming over clover Followed the thunder of cattle rising to their
feet and the triple crack of a whip The little wind had dropped for a
moment only to fall on the herd with a shriek and a few stinging drops
of hail that stung as keenly as the whips The herd broke into a trot
a canter and then a mad gallop Black fear was behind them black
night in front They headed into the night bellowing with terror
and at their side rode the men with the whips The ponies grunted as
they felt the raking spurs They knew that an allnight gallop lay
before them and woe betide the luckless cayuse that stumbled in that
ride Then fell the hailblinding and choking and flogging in one and
the same stroke The herd opened like a fan The red steer headed a
contingent he knew not whither A man with a whip rode at his right
flank Behind him the lightning showed a field of glimmering horns and
of muzzles flecked with foam a field of red terrorstrained eyes and
shaggy frontlets The man looked back also and his terror was greater
than that of the beasts The herd had surrounded him in the darkness
His salvation lay in the legs of Whisky Peatand Whisky Peat knew
itknew it until an unseen gopher hole received his near forefoot as
he strained every nervein the heart of the flying herd with the red
steer at his flanks Then being only overworked cayuse Whisky
Peat fell and the red steer fancied that there was something soft on
the ground

                                   

It was Michigan Jim and Lafe who at last brought the herd to a
standstill as the dawn was breaking Whats come to The Corpse quoth
Lafe Jim loosened the girths of his quivering pony and made answer
slowly Onless Im a blamed fool the gentleman is now livin up to
his durned appellation bout fifteen miles backwhat there is of him
and the cayuse Lets go and look said Lafe shuddering slightly
for the morning air you must understand was raw Lets go toa
much hotter place than Texas responded Jim Get the steers to the
Junction first Guess whats left of The Corpse will keep

And it did And that was how the fat man in Chicago got his beef It
belonged to the red steer

THE HISTORY OF A FALL


Mere English will not do justice to the event Let us attempt it
according to the custom of the French Thus and so following

Listen to a history of the most painfuland of the most true
You others the Governors the LieutenantGovernors and the
Commissionaires of the Oriental Indias

It is you foolishly outside of the truth in prey to illusions so blind
that I of them remain so stupefiedit is to you that I address myself

Know you Sir Cyril Wollobie KCSI CMG and all the other little
things

He was of the Sacred Order of Yourselfa man responsible
enormouslycharged of the conservation of millions

Of people That is understood The Indian Government conserves not its
rupees

He was the wellloved of kings I have seen the Viceroywhich is the
LorrMaireembrace him of both arms

That was in Simla All things are possible in Simla

Even embraces

His wife Mon Dieu his wife

The aheuried imagination prostrates itself at the remembrance of the
splendours Orientals of the Lady Cyrilthe very respectable the Lady
Wollobie

That was in Simla All things are possible in Simla Even wives In
those days I waswhat you calla Schnobb I am now a much larger
Schnobb Voila the only difference Thus it is true that travel
expands the mind

But let us return to our Wollobies

I admired that man there with the both hands I crawled before the
Lady Wollobieplatonically The man the most brave would be only
platonic towards that lady And I was also afraid Subsequently I
went to a dance The wine equalled not the splendour of the Wollobies
Nor the food But there was upon the floor an open spacelarge and
parklike It protected the dignity Wollobicallisme It was guarded by
AidesdeCamp With blue silk in their coattailsturned up With pink
eyes and white moustaches to ravish Also turned up

To me addressed himself an AidedeCamp

That was in Simla Today I do not speak to AidesdeCamp

I confine myself exclusively to the cabdrivaire He does not know so
much bad language but he can drive better

I approached under the protection of the AidedeCamp the luminosity
of Sir Wollobie

The world entire regarded

The band stopped The lights burned blue A domestic dropped a plate

It was an inspiring moment

From the summit of Jakko fortyfive monkies looked down upon the crisis

Sir Wollobie spoke

To me in that expanse of floor cultured and parklike He said I have
long desired to make your acquaintance

The blood bouilloned in my head I became pink I was aneantied under
the weight of an embarras insubrimable

At that moment Sir Wollobie became oblivious of my personality That
was his custom

Wiping my face upon my coattails I refugied myself among the foules

I had been spoken to by Sir Wollobie That was in Simla That also is
history

                                   

Pass now several years To the day before yesterday

This also is historyfarcical immense tragicomic but true

Know you the Totnam Cortrode

Here lives Maple who sells washing appliances and tables of exotic
legs

Here voyages also a Omnibuse Proletariat

That is to say for One penny

Two pence is the refined volupt of the Aristocrat

I am of the people

Entre nous the connection is not desired by us The people address to
me epithets entirely unprintable I reply that they should wash The
situation is strained Hence the Strike Docks and the Demonstrations
Laborious

Upon the funeste tumbril of the Proletariat I take my seat

I demand air outside upon the roof

I will have all my penny

The tumbril advances

A man aged loses his equilibrium and deposits himself into my lap

Following the custom of the Brutal Londoner I demand the Devil where he
shoves himself

He apologises supplicatorically

I grunt

Encore the tumbril shakes herself

I appropriate the desired seat of the old man

The conductaire cries to loud voice Fare Guvnor

He produces one penny

A reminiscence phantasmal provokes itself

I beat him on the back

It is Sir Wollobie the exEverything

Also the exEverything else

Figure you the situation

He clasps my hand

As a child clasps the hand of its nurse

He demands of me particular rensignments of my health It is to him a
matter important

Other time he regulated the health of fortyfive millions

I riposte I enquire of his liverhis pancreas his abdomen

The sacred internals of Sir Wollobie

He has them all And they all make him ill

He is very lonely He speaks of his wife There is no Lady Wollobie
but a woman in a flat in Bayswater who cries in her sleep for more
curricles

He does not say this but I understand

He derides the Council of the Indian Office He imprecates the
Government

He curses the journals

He has a clob He curses that clob

Females with teeth monstrous explain to him the theory of Government

Men of long hair the psychologues of the paintpots correct him
tenderly but from above

He has known of the actualities of lifeDeath Power Responsibility
Honourthe Good accomplished the effacement of Wrong for forty years

There remains to him a seat in a penny bus

If I do not take him from that

I rap my heels on the knifeboard I sing tra la la I am also well
disposed to larmes

He courbes himself underneath an ulstaire and he damns the fog to
eternity

He wills not that I leave him He desires that I come to dinner

I am grave I think upon Lady Wollobieshorn of chaprassiesat the
Clob Not in Bayswater

I accept He will bore me affreusely but  I have taken his seat

He descends from the tumbril of his humiliation and the street hawker
rolls a barrow up his waistcoat

Then intervenes the fogdense impenetrable hopeless without end

It is because of the fog that there is a drop upon the end of my nose
so chiselled

Gentlemen the Governors the LieutenantGovernors and the Commissaires
behold the doom prepared

I am descended to the gates of your Life in Death Which is Brompton or
Bayswater

You do not believe You will try the constituencies when you return is
it not so

You will fail As others failed

Your seat waits you on the top of an Omnibuse Proletariat

I shall be there

You will embrace me as a shipwrecked man embraces a log You will be
dam glad t see me

I shall grin

Oh Life Oh Death Oh Power Oh Toil Oh Hope Oh Stars Oh Honour Oh
Lodgings Oh Fog Oh Omnibuses Oh Despair Oh Skittles

GRIFFITHS THE SAFE MAN


As the title indicates this story deals with the safeness of Griffiths
the safe man the secure person the reliable individual the sort of
man you would bank with I am proud to write about Griffiths for I owe
him a pleasant day This story is dedicated to my friend Griffiths the
remarkably trustworthy mortal

In the beginning there were points about Griffiths He quoted proverbs
A man who quotes proverbs is confounded by proverbs He is also
confounded by his friends But I never confounded Griffithsnot even
in that supreme moment when the sweat stood on his brow in agony and
his teeth were fixed like bayonets and he swore horribly Even then I
say I sat on my own trunk the trunk that opened and told Griffiths
that I had always respected him but never more than at the present
moment He was so safe y know

Safeness is a matter of no importance to me If my trunk wont lock
when I jump on it thrice I strap it up and go on to something else If
my carpetbag is too full I let the tails of shirts and the ends of
ties bubble over and go down the street with the affair It all comes
right in the end and if it does not what is a man that he should
fight against Fate

But Griffiths is not constructed in that manner He says Safe bind is
safe find That rather is what he used to say He has seen reason
to alter his views Everything about Griffiths is safeentirely safe
His trunk is locked by two hermetical gunmetal doubleend Chubbs
his beddingroll opens to a letter padlock capable of two million
combinations his hatbox has a lever patent safety on it and the
grief of his life is that he cannot lock up the ribs of his umbrella
safely If you could get at his soul you would find it ready strapped
up and labelled for heaven That is Griffiths

When we went to Japan together Griffiths kept all his money under lock
and key I carried mine in my coattail pocket But all Griffiths
contraptions did not prevent him from spending exactly as much as I
did You see when he had worried his way through the big strap and
the little strap and the slidevalve and the spring lock and the key
that turned twice and a quarter he felt as though he had earned any
money he found whereas I could get masses of sinful wealth by merely
pulling out my handkerchiefdollars and five dollars and ten dollars
all mixed up with the tobacco or flying down the road They looked much
too pretty to spend

Safe bind safe find said Griffiths in the treaty port

He never really began to lock things up severely till we got our
passports to travel upcountry He took charge of mine for me on the
ground that I was an imbecile As you are asked for your passport at
every other shop all the hotels most of the places of amusement and
on the top of each hill I got to appreciate Griffiths selfsacrifice
He would be biting a strap with his teeth or calculating the
combinations of his padlocks among a ring of admiring Japanese while I
went for a walk into the interior

Safe bind safe find said Griffiths That was true because I was
bound to find Griffiths somewhere near his beloved keys and straps
He never seemed to see that half the pleasure of his trip was being
strapped and keyed out of him

We never had any serious difficulty about the passports in the whole
course of our wanderings What I purpose to describe now is merely an
incident of travel It had no effect on myself but it nearly broke
Griffiths heart

We were travelling from Kyoto to Otsu along a very dusty road full of
pretty girls Every time I stopped to play with one of them Griffiths
grew impatient He had telegraphed for rooms at the only hotel in Otsu
and was afraid that there would be no accommodation There were only
three rooms in the hotel and Safe bind safe find said Griffiths
He was telegraphing ahead for something

Our hotel was threequarters Japanese and onequarter European If
you walked across it it shook and if you laughed the roof fell off
Strange Japanese came in and dined with you and Jap maidens looked
through the windows of the bathroom while you were bathing

We had hardly put the luggage down before the proprietor asked for
our passports He asked me of all people in the world I have the
passports said Griffiths with pride They are in the yellowhide
bag Turn it very carefully on to the right side my good man You
have no such locks in Japan Im quite certain Then he knelt down
and brought out a bunch of keys as big as his fist You must know that
every Japanese carries a little belaitimade handbag with nickel
fastenings They take an interest in handbags

Safe bind safe Dn the key Whats wrong with it said
Griffiths

The hotel proprietor bowed and smiled very politely for at least five
minutes Griffiths crawling over and under and round and about his bag
the while Its a percussating compensator said he half to himself
Ive never known a percussating compensator do this before He was
getting heated and red in the face

Key stuck eh I told you those fooling little spring locks are sure
to go wrong sooner or later

Fooling little devils Its a percussating comp There goes
the key Now it wont move either way Ill give you the passport
tomorrow Passport kul demang mananacatchee in a little time
Wont that do for you

Griffiths was getting really angry The proprietor was more polite than
ever He bowed and left the room Thats a good little chap said
Griffiths Now well settle down and see what the mischiefs wrong
with this bag You catch one end

Not in the least I said Safe bind safe find You did the
binding How can you expect me to do the finding Im an imbecile unfit
to be trusted with a passport and now Im going for a walk The
Japanese are really the politest nation in the world When the hotel
proprietor returned with a policeman he did not at once thrust the man
on Griffiths notice He put him in the verandah and let him clank his
sword gently once or twice

Little chaps brought a blacksmith said Griffiths but when he saw
the policeman his face became ugly The policeman came into the room
and tried to assist Have you ever seen a fourfoot policeman in white
cotton gloves and a standup collar lunging percussating compensator
look with a fivefoot sword I enjoyed the sight for a few minutes
before I went out to look at Otsu which is a nice town No one
hindered me Griffiths was so completely the head of the firm that had
I set the town on fire he would have been held responsible

I went to a temple and a policeman said passport I said The other
gentleman has got Where is other gentleman said the policeman
syllable by syllable in the Ollendorfian style In the hotel
said I and he waddled off to catch him It seemed to me that I could
do a great deal towards cheering Griffiths all alone in his bedroom
with that wicked bad lock the hotel proprietor the policeman the
roomboy and the girl who helped one to bathe With this idea I stood
in front of four policemen and they all asked for my passport and were
all sent to the hotel syllable by syllableI mean one by one

Some soldiers of the th NI were strolling about the streets and
they were idle It is unwise to let a soldier be idle He may get
drunk When the fourth policeman said Where is other gentleman I
said In the hotel and take soldiersthose soldiers

How many soldiers said the policeman firmly

Take all soldiers I said There were four files in the street just
then The policeman spoke to them and they caught up their big
swordbayonets nearly as long as themselves and waddled after him

I followed them but first I bought some sweets and gave one to a
child That was enough Long before I had reached the hotel I had a
tail of fifty babies These I seduced into the long passage that ran
through the house and then I slid the grating that answers to the big
halldoor That house was fullpit boxes and galleriesfor Griffiths
had created an audience of his own and I also had not been idle

The four files of soldiers and the five policemen were marking time on
the boards of Griffiths room while the landlord and the landlords
wife and the two scullions and the bathgirl and the cookboy and
the boy who spoke English and the boy who didnt and the boy who
tried to and the cook filled all the space that wasnt devoted to
babies asking the foreigner for more sweets

Somewhere in the centre of the mess was Griffiths and a yellowhide
bag I dont think he had looked up once since I left for as he
raised his eyes at my voice I heard him cry Good heavens are they
going to train the guns of the city on me Whats the meaning of the
regiment Im a British subject

What are you looking for I asked

The passportsyour passportsthe doubledyed passports Oh give a
man room to use his arms Get me a hatchet

The passports the passports I said Have you looked in your
greatcoat Its on the bed and theres a blue envelope in it that
looks like a passport You put it there before you left Kyoto

Griffiths looked The landlord looked The landlord took the passport
and bowed The five policemen bowed and went out one by one the th
NI formed fours and went out the household bowed and there was a
long silence Then the bathgirl began to giggle

When Griffiths wanted to speak to me I was on the other side of the
regiment of children in the passage and he had time to reflect before
he could work his way through them

They formed his guardofhonour when he took the bag to the locksmith

I abode on the mountains of Otsu till dinnertime

IT


There was no talk of it for a fortnight We spoke of latitude and
longitude and the proper manufacture of sherry cobblers while the
steamer cut open a glassysmooth sea Then we turned towards China and
drank farewell to the nearer East

We shall reach Hongkong without being it said the nervous lady

Nobody of ordinary strength of mind ever was it said the big fat man
with the voice I kept my eye on the big fat man He boasted too much

The China seas are governed neither by wind nor calm Deep down under
the sapphire waters sits a green and yellow devil who suffers from
indigestion perpetually When he is unwell he troubles the waters above
with his twistings and writhings Thus it happens that it is never
calm in the China seas

The sun was shining brightly when the big fat man with the voice came
up the companion and looked at the horizon

Hah said he calm as ditch water Now I remember when I was in
the Florida in  meeting a tidalwave that turned us upside down
for five minutes and most of the people inside out by Jove He
expatiated at length on the heroism displayed by himself when even the
Captain was down sir

I said nothing but I kept my eyes upon the strong man

The sun continued to shine brightly and it also kept an eye in the
same direction I went to the faroff focsle where the sheep and the
cow and the bosun and the secondclass passengers dwell together in
amity Bosun said I hows her head

Direckly in front of her sir replied that illmannered soul
but we shall be meetin a headsea in half an hour thatll put your
head atween of your legs Go aft an tell that to them firstclass
passengers

I went aft but I said nothing We went later to tiffin and there
was a fine funereal smell of stale curries and tinned meats in the air
Conversation was animated for most of the passengers had been together
for five weeks and had developed two or three promising flirtations
I was a strangera minnow among Tritonsa third man in the cabin
Only those who have been a third man in the cabin know what this means
Suddenly and without warning our ship curtsied It was neither a bob
nor a duck nor a lurch but a long sweeping stately oldfashioned
curtsy Followed a lull in the conversation I was distinctly conscious
that I had left my stomach two feet in the air and waited for the
return roll to join it Prettily the old hooper rides doesnt she
said the strong man I hope she wont do it often said the pretty
lady with the changing complexion

Whahoop Whawhawhawilly whoop said the screw that had
managed to come out of the water and was racing wildly

Good heavens is the ship going down said the fat lady clutching
her own private claret bottle that she might not die athirst The
ship went down at the wordwith a drunken lurch down she went and a
smothered yell from one of the cabins showed that there was water in
the sea The portholes closed with a clash and we rose and fell on
the swell of the bosuns headsea The conversation died out Some
complained that the saloon was stuffy and fled upstairs to the deck
The strong man brought up the rear

Ooshyooshywooshywoggle wop cried a big wave without a head
Get up old girl and he smacked the ship most disrespectfully under
the counter and she squirmed as she took the drift of the next sea

Sheahrides very prettily repeated the strong man as the
companion stairs spurned him from them and he wound his arms round the
nearest steward

Damn prettily said the necked officer Im going to lie down
Never could stand the China seas

Most refreshing thing in the world said the strong man faintly

I took counsel purely with myself which is to say my stomach and
perceived that the worst would not befall me

Come to the focsle then and feel the wind said I to the strong
man The ploversegg eyes of three yellowishgreen girls were upon him

With pleasure said he and I bore him away to where the cutwater
was pulling up the scared flyingfishes as a spaniel flushes game In
front of us was the illimitable blue lightly ridged by the procession
of the big blind rollers Up rose the stem till six feet of the red
paint stood clear above the bluefrom twentythree feet to eighteen I
could count as I leaned over Then the sapphire crashed into splintered
crystal with a musical jar and the white spray licked the anchor
channels as we drove down and down sucking at the sea I kept my eye
upon the strong man and I noticed that his mouth was slightly open
the better to inhale the rushing wind When I looked a second time
he was gone The driven spray was scarcely quicker in its flight My
excellent stomach behaved with temperance and chastity I enjoyed the
focsle and my delight was the greater when I reflected on the strong
man Unless I was much mistaken he would know all about it in half an
hour

I went aft and a lull between two waves heard the petulant pop of a
champagne cork No one drinks champagne after tiffin except It

The strong man had ordered the champagne There were bottles of it
flying about the quarterdeck The engaged couple were sipping it out
of one glass but their faces were averted like our parents of old
They were ashamed

You may go You may go to Hongkong for me shouted halfadozen
little waves together pulling the ship several ways at once She
rolled stately and from that moment settled down to the work of the
evening I cannot blame her for I am sure she did not know her own
strength It didnt hurt her to be on her side and play catandmouse
and pussinthe corner and hideandseek but it destroyed the
passengers One by one they sank into long chairs and gazed at the sky
But even there the little white moved and there was not one stable
thing in heaven above or the waters beneath My virtuous and very
respectable stomach behaved with integrity and resolution I treated
it to a gin cocktail which I sucked by the side of the strong man
who told me in confidence that he had been overcome by the sun at the
focsle Sun fever does not make people cold and clammy and blue I
sat with him and tried to make him talk about the Florida and his
voyages in the past He evaded me and went down below Three minutes
later I followed him with a thick cheroot Into his bunk I went for I
knew he would be helpless He washe washe was He wallowed supine
and I stood in the doorway smoking

What is it said I

He wrestled with his pridehis wicked pridebut he would not tell a
lie

It said he And it was so

                                   

The rolling continues The ship is a shambles and I have six places on
each side of me all to myself

A FALLEN IDOL


Will the public be good enough to look into this business It has sent
Crewe to bed and Mottleby is applying for home leave and Ive lost
my faith in man altogether and the Club gives it up Trivey is the
only man who is unaffected by the catastrophe and he says I told you
so We were all proud of Trivey at the Club and would have crowned
him with wreaths of Bougainvillea had he permitted the liberty But
Trivey was an austere man The utmost that he permitted himself to say
was I can stretch a little bit when Im in the humour We called
him the Monumental Liar Nothing that the Club offered was too good
for Trivey He had the soft chair opposite the thermantidote in the
hot weather and he made up his own four at whist When visitors came
inglobetrotters for choiceTrivey used to unmuzzle himself and tell
tales that sent the globetrotter out of the Club on tiptoe looking for
snakes in his hat and tigers in the compound Whenever a man from a
strange Club came in Trivey used to call for a whisky and gingerwine
and rout that man on all pointsfrom horses upward There was a man
whose nickname was Ananias who came from the Princes Plungers to
look at Trivey and though Trivey was only a civilian the Plunger
man resigned his title to the nickname before eleven oclock He made
it over to Trivey on a card and Trivey hung up the concession in his
quarters We loved Triveyall of us and now we dont love him any
more

A man from the frontier came in and began to tell talessome very
good ones and some better than good He was an outsider but he had
a wonderful imaginationfor the frontier He told six stories before
Trivey brought up his first line and three more before Trivey hurled
his reserves into the fray

When I was at Anungaracharlupillay in Madras said Trivey quietly
there was a rogue elephant cutting about the district And I came
upon him asleep All the Club stopped talking here until Trivey had
finished the story He told us that he in the company of another
man had found the rogue asleep but just as they got up to the
brutes head it woke up with a scream Then Trivey who was careful to
explain that he was a bit powerful about the arms caught hold of
its ears as it rose and hung there kicking the animal in the eyes
which so bewildered it that it stayed screaming and frightened until
Triveys ally shot it behind the shoulder and the villagers ran in
and hamstrung it It evidently died from loss of blood Trivey was
hanging on the ears and kicking hard for nearly fifteen minutes When
the frontier man heard the story he put his hands in front of his
face and sobbed audibly We gave him all the drinks he wanted and he
recovered sufficiently to carry away eighty rupees at whist later on
but his nerve was irretrievably shattered He will be no use on the
frontier any more The rest of the Club were very pleased with Trivey
because these frontier men and especially the guides want a great
deal of keeping in order Trivey was quite modest He was a truly great
soul and popular applause never turned his head As I have said we
loved Trivey till that fatal day when Crewe announced that he had
been transferred for a couple of months to Anungaracharlupillay Oh
said Trivey I dare say theyll remember about my rogue elephant down
there You ask em Crewe Then we felt sorry for Trivey because we
were sure that he was arriving at that stage of mental decay when a man
begins to believe in his own fictions That spoils a mans hand Crewe
wrote up once or twice to Mottleby saying that he would bring back a
story that would make our hair curl Good stories are scarce in Madras
and we rather scoffed at the announcement When Crewe returned it was
easy to see that he was bursting with importance He gave a big dinner
at the Club and invited nearly everybody but Trivey who went off
after dinner to teach a young subaltern to play snooker At coffee
and cheroots Crewe could not restrain himself any longer I say you
Johnnies its all trueevery single word of itand you can throw the
decanter at my head and Ill apologise The whole village was full of
it There was a rogue elephant and it slept and Trivey did catch hold
of its ears and kick it in the eyes and hang on for ten minutes at
least and all the rest of it I neglected my regular work to sift that
story and on my honour the tales an absolute fact The headsman said
so all the shikaries said so and all the villagers corroborated it
Now would a whole village volunteer a lie that would do them no good

You might have heard a cigarash fall after this statement Then
Mottleby said with deep disgust What can you do with a man like
that His best and brightest lie too Tisnt shrieked Crewe
Its a facta nickelplated teakwood Tantalusaction fortyfive
rupee fact That only makes it worse said Mottleby and we all
felt that was true We ran into the billiardroom to talk to Trivey
but he said we had put him off his stroke and that was all the
satisfaction we got out of him Later on he repeated that he was a bit
powerful about the arms and went to bed We sat up half the night
devising vengeance on Trivey We were very angry and there was no hope
of hushing up the tale The man had taken us in completely and now
that weve lost our champion Ananias all the frontier will laugh at
us and we shall never be able to trust a word that Trivey says

I ask with Mottleby What can you do with a man like that

NEW BROOMS

 If seven maids with seven mops
   Swept it for half a year
 Do you suppose the Walrus said
   That they could sweep it clear


Ram Buksh Aryan went to bed with his buffalo five goats three
children and a wife because the evening mists were chilly His hut was
builded on the mud scooped from a green and smelly tank and there were
microbes in the thin blood of Ram Buksh

Ram Buksh went to bed on a charpoy stretched across the blue tepid
drain because the nights were hot and there were more microbes in
his blood Then the rains came and Ram Buksh paddled midthigh deep
in water for a day or two with his buffaloes till he was aware of a
crampsome feeling at the pit of his stomach Mother of my children
said Ram Buksh this is death They gave him cardamoms and capsicums
and gingellyoil and cloves and they prayed for him It is enough
said Ram Buksh and he twisted himself into a knot and died and they
burned him slightlyfor the wood was dampand the rest of him floated
down the river and was caught in an undercurrent at the bank and
there stayed and when Imam Din the Jeweller drank of the stream five
days later he drank Lethe and passed away crying in vain upon his
gods

His family did not report his death to the Municipality for they
desired to keep Imam Din with them Therefore they buried him under
the flagging in the courtyard secretly and by night Twelve days
later Imam Din had made connection with the well of the house and
there was typhus among the women in the zenana but no one knew
anything about itsome died and some did not and Ari Booj the
Faquir added to the interest of the proceedings by joining the
funeral procession and distributing gratis the more malignant forms of
smallpox from which he was just recovering He had come all the way
from Delhi and had slept on no less than fifteen different charpoys
and that was how they got the smallpox into Bahadurgarh But Eshmith
Sahibs Dhobi picked it up from Ari Booj when Imam Dins wife was being
buriedfor he was a merry man and sent home a beautiful sample among
the Sunday shirts So Eshmith Sahib died

He was only a link in the chain which crawled from the highest to the
lowest The wonder was not that men died like sheep but that they
did not die like flies for their lives and their surroundings their
deaths were part of a huge conspiracy against cleanliness And the
people loved to have it so They huddled together in frowsy clusters
while Death mowed his way through them till the scythe blunted against
the unresisting flesh and he had to get a new one They died by fever
tens of thousands in a month they died by cholera a thousand in a
week they died of smallpox scores in the mohulla and by dysentery by
tens in a house and when all other deaths failed they laid them down
and died because their hands were too weak to hold on to life

To and fro stamped the Englishman who is everlastingly at war with the
scheme of things You shall not die he said and he decreed that
there should be no more famines He poured grain down their throats
and when all failed he went down into the strife and died with them
swearing and toiling and working till the last He fought the famine
and put it to flight Then he wiped his forehead and attacked the
pestilence that walketh in the darkness Deaths scythe swept to and
fro around and about him but he only planted his feet more firmly
in the way of it and fought off Death with a dogwhip Live you
ruffian said the Englishman to Ram Buksh as he rode through the
reeking village Jenab said Ram Buksh it is as it was in the
days of our fathers Then stand back while I alter it said the
Englishman and by force and cunning and a brutal disregard of vested
interests he strove to keep Ram Buksh alive Clean your mohullas pay
for clean water keep your streets swept and see that your food is
sound or Ill make your life a burden to you said the Englishman
Sometimes he died but more often Ram Buksh went down and the
Englishman regarded each death as a personal insult

Softly there said the Government of India Youre twisting his
tail You mustnt do that The spread of education forbids and Ram
Buksh is an intelligent voter Let him work out his own salvation

Hm said the Englishman with his head in a midden collectively you
always were a fool Here Ram Buksh the Sirkar says you are to do all
these things for yourself

Jenab says Ram Buksh and fell to breeding microbes with renewed
vigour

Curiously enough it was in the centres of enlightenment that he
prosecuted his experiments most energetically The education had been
spread but so thinly that it could not disguise Ram Bukshs natural
instincts He created an African village and said it was the hub of
the universe and all the dirt of all the roads failed to convince
him that he was not the most advanced person in the world There was
a pause and Ram Buksh got himself fearfully entangled among Boards
and Committees but he valued them as a bowerbird values shells and
red rags See said the Englishman to the Government of India
he is blind on that sideblind by birth training instinct and
associations Fivesixths of him is poor stock raised off poor soil
and hell die on the least provocation Youve no right to let him kill
himself

But hes educated said the Government of India

Ill concede everything said the Englishman Hes a statesman
author poet politician artist and all else that you wish him to
be but he isnt a Sanitary Engineer And while youre training him
he is dying Goodness knows that my share in the Government is very
limited nowadays but Im willing to do all the work while he gets all
the credit if youll only let me have some authority over him in his
mudpie making

But the liberty of the subject is sacred said the Government of
India

I havent any said the Englishman He can trail through my
compounds start shrines in the public roads poison my family have
me in court for nothing ruin my character spend my money and call
me an assassin when all is done I dont object Let me look after his
sanitation

But the days of a paternal Government are over we must depend on the
people Think of what they would say at home said the Government of
India We have issued a resolutionindeed we have

The Englishman sat down and groaned I believe youll issue a
resolution some day notifying your own abolition said he What are
you going to do

Constitute more Boards said the Government of India Boards of
Control and SupervisionFund Boardsall sorts of Boards Nothing
like system It will be at work in three years or so We havent any
money but thats a detail

The Englishman looked at the resolution and sniffed It doesnt touch
the weak point of the country

What will touch the weak point of the country then said the
Government of India

I used to said the Englishman I was the District Officer and I
twisted their tails You have taken away my power and now

Well said the Government of India you seem to think a good deal of
yourself

Never mind me said the Englishman Im an effete relic of the past
But Ram Buksh will die as he used to do

And now we all wait to see which is right

TIGLATH PILESER


Thank Heaven he is dead The municipality sent a cart and a man only
this morning and all the servants aiding with ropes and tackle the
carcase of Tiglath was borne awaya wobbling lump His head was thrust
over the tailboard of the cart Upon it was stamped an expression of
horror and surprise unutterable and grotesque I have put away my
rifle I have cheered my heart with wine and I sit down now to write
the story of Tiglath the Utter Brute His own kind alas will not
read it and thus it will be shorn of instruction but owners will
kindly take notice and when it pleases Heaven to inflict them with
such an animal as Tiglath they will know what to do

To begin with I bought him his vices thick as his barsati for a
hundred and seventy rupees a fivechambered muzzleloading revolver
and a Cawnpore saddle

Of course for that price said Staveley you cant expect
everything Hes not what one would call absolutely sound y know but
theres no end of work in him and if you only give him the butt hell
go like a steamengine

Staveley I answered when you admit that he is not perfection
I perceive that I am in for a really Good Thing Dont hurt your
conscience Staveley Tell me what is his chief viceweakness
partialityanything you choose to call it I shall get to know the
minor defects in the course of nature but what is Tiglaths real
shouk

Staveley reflected a moment Well really I cant quite say old
man straight off the reel y know Hes a oner to go when his heads
turned to home Hes a regular feeder and vaseline will cure that
little eruptionwith its malignant barsatiin no time Oh I forgot
his shouk I dont know exactly how to describe it but he yaws a good
deal said Staveley

He how muches I asked

Yaws said Staveley goes a bit wide upon occasions but a good
coachwan will cure that in one drive My man let him do what he liked
One fifty and a hundred ten and ten is twentyoneseventy Many
thanks indeed Ill send over his bedding and ropes Hes a powerful
upstanding horse though rather picked up just at present

Staveley departed and I was left alone with Tiglath I called him
Tiglath because he resembled a lathy pig Later on I called him Pileser
on account of his shouk but my coachwan a strong masterless man
called him haramzada chor shaitan k bap and oont ki beta
He certainly was a powerful horse being full fifteentwo at the
withers with the girth of a waler and at first the docility of an
Arab There was something wrong with his feetpermanentlybut he
was a considerate beast and never had more than one leg in hospital
at a time The other three were still movable and Tiglath never
grudged them in my service I write this in justice to his memory the
creaking of the wheels of the municipal cart being still in my ears

For a seasonsome twelve daysTiglath was beyond reproach He had
not a cheerful disposition nor did his pendulous underlip add to
his personal beauty but he made no complaints and moved swiftly to
and from office The hot weather gave place to the cool breezes of
October and with the turn of the year the slumbering devil in the soul
of Tiglath spread its wings and crowed aloud I fed him well I had
aided his barsati I had lapped his lame legs in thanda putties and
adorned his sinful body with new harness He rewarded me upon a day
with an exhibition so new and strange that I feared for the moment his
reason had been unhinged Slowly with a malevolent grin Tiglath the
pampered turned at right angles to the carriagea newlyvarnished
oneand backed the front wheels up the verandah steps letting them
down with a bump He then wheeled round and round in the portico and
all but brought the carriage over The show lasted for ten minutes at
the end of which time he trotted peacefully away

I was pained and grievednothing more upon my honour I forbade
the sais to kick Tiglath in the stomach for I was persuaded that
the harness galled him and in this belief at the end of the day
undressed him tenderly and fitted sheepskin all over the said harness
Tiglath ate the sheepskin next day and I did not renew it

A week later I met the Judge It was a purely accidental interview
I would have avoided it as the Judge and I did not love each other
but the shafts of my carriage were through the circular front of his
brougham and Tiglath was rubbing the boss of his headstall tenderly
against the newlyvarnished panels of the same The Judge complained
that he might have been impaled as he sat My coachwan declared on oath
that the horse deliberately ran into the brougham Tiglath tendered no
evidence and I began to mistrust him

At the end of a month I perceived that my friends and acquaintances
avoided me markedly The appearance of Tiglath at the bandstand was
enough to clear a space of ten yards in my immediate neighbourhood I
had to shout to my friends from afar and they shouted back the details
of the little bills which I had to pay their coachbuilders Tiglath
was suffering from carriagecidal mania and the coachwan had asked for
leave Stay with me Ibrahim I said Thou seest how the sahib log
do now avoid us Get a new and a stout chabuq and instruct Tiglath in
the paths of straight walking

He will smash the Heavenborns carriage He is an old and stale
devil but in this matter extreme wise answered Ibrahim Kitto
sahibs filton hath he smashed and Burkitt sahibs brougham gharri
and another tumtum and Staveley sahibs carriage is still being
mended What profit is this horse He feigns blindness and much fear
and in the guise of innocency works evil I will stay sahib but the
blood of this thy new carriage be upon the brutes head and not upon
mine own

I have no space to describe the war of the next few weeks Foiled
in his desire to ruin only neighbours property Tiglath fell back
literally upon his ownmy carriage He tried the verandah step
trick till he bent the springs and wheeled round till the turning
action grew redhot he scraped stealthily by walls he performed
between heavyladen bullocktrains but his chief delight was a pas
de fantasie on a dark night and a high level road Yet what he did
he did staidly and without heat as without remorse He was vetted
thrice and his eyes were pronounced sound After this information
I laid my bones to the battle and acquired a desperate facility of
leaping from the carriage and kicking Tiglath on the stomach as soon as
he wheeled around leaping back at the risk of my life when he set off
at full speed I pressed the lighted end of a cheroot just behind the
collarbuckle I applied fusees to those flaccid nostrils and I beat
him about the head with a stick continually It was necessary but it
was also demoralising A year of Tiglath would have converted me into
a coldblooded vivisectionist or a native bullockdriver Each day I
took stock of the injuries to my carriage I had long since given up
all hope of keeping it in decent repair and each day I devised fresh
torments for Tiglath

He never meant to injure himself I am certain and no one was more
astonished than he when he backed on the Balumon road and dropped the
carriage into a nullah on the night of the Jamabundi Moguls dance I
did not go to the dance I was bent considerably and one side of the
coachwans face was flayed When he had pieced the wreck together he
only said Sahib and I said only Bohat acha But we each knew
what the other meant Next morn Tiglath was stiff and strained I gave
him time to recover and to enjoy life When I heard him squealing to
the grasscutters ponies I knew that the hour had come I ordered
the carriage and myself superintended the funeral toilet of Tiglath
His harness brasses shone like gold his coat like a bottle and he
lifted his feet daintily Had he even then at the eleventh hour given
promise of amendment I should have held my hand But as I entered
the carriage I saw the hunching of his quarters that presaged trouble
Go forward Tiglath my love my pride my delight I murmured For
a surety it is a matter of life and death this day The sais ran to
his head with a fragment of chupatti saved from his all too scanty
rations the man loved him And Tiglath swung round to the left in the
portico round and round swung he till the near ear touched the muzzle
of the shotgun that waited its coming He never flinched he pressed
his fate The coachwan threw down the reins as with four ounces of
No  shot behind the hollow of the root of the ear Tiglath fell In
his death he accomplished the desire of his life for he fell upon the
shaft and broke it into three pieces I looked on him as he lay and of
a sudden the reason of the horror in his eyes was made clear Tiglath
the breaker of carriages the strong the rebellious had passed into
the shadowy spirit land where there was nought to destroy and no power
to destroy it with The ghastly foreknowledge of the flitting soul
was written on the glazing eyeball

I repented me then that I had slain Tiglath for I had no intention
of punishing him in the hereafter

THE LIKES O US


It was the General Officer Commanding riding down the Mall on the
Arab with the perky tail and he condescended to explain some of the
mysteries of his profession But the point on which he dwelt most
pompously was the ease with which the Private Thomas Atkins could be
handled as he called it Only feed him and give him a little work
to do and you can do anything with him said the General Officer
Commanding Theres no refinement about Tommy you know and one
is very like another Theyve all the same ideas and traditions and
prejudices Theyre all big children Fancy any man in his senses
shooting about these hills There was the report of a shotgun in the
valley I suppose theyve hit a dog Happy as the day is long when
theyre out shooting dogs Just like a big child is Tommy He touched
up his horse and cantered away There was a sound of angry voices down
the hillside

All right you soorI wont never forget thismind you not as
long as I live and s elp meIll The sentence finished in what
could be represented by a blaze of asterisks

A deeper voice cut it short Oh no you wont neither Look ahere
you young smitcher If I was to take yer up now and knock off your
ead again that tree could ye say anythin No nor yet do anythin
If I was toAh you would would you There Some one had evidently
sat down with a thud and was swearing nobly I slid over the edge of
the khud down through the long grass and fetched up after the
manner of a sledge with my feet in the broad of the back of Gunner
Barnabas in the Mountain Battery my friend the very strong man He
was sitting upon a mana khakicoloured volcano of blasphemyand was
preparing to smoke My sudden arrival threw him off his balance for a
moment Then readjusting his chair he bade me goodday

Im an me ave bin avin an argment said Gunner Barnabas
placidly I was going for to half kill him an eave im into the
bushes ere but seein that you ave come sir and very welcome when
you do come we will ave a courtmartial instead Shacklock are you
willin The volcano who had been swearing uninterruptedly through
this oration expressed a desire in general and particular terms to
see Gunner Barnabas in Torment and the civilian on the next gridiron

Private Shacklock was a towhaired scrofulous boy of about
twoandtwenty His nose was bleeding profusely and the live air
attested that he had been drinking quite as much as was good for him
He lay stomachdown on a little level spot on the hillside for
Gunner Barnabas was sitting between his shoulderblades and his was
not a weight to wriggle under Private Shacklock could barely draw
breath to swear but he did the best that in him lay Amen said
Gunner Barnabas piously when an unusually brilliant string of oaths
came to an end Seein that this gentleman ere has never seen the
inside o the orsepitals youve gotten in and the clinks youve been
chucked into like a haybundle perhaps Privite Shacklock you will
stop You are amakin of im sick Private Shacklock said that he was
pleased to hear it and would have continued his speech but his breath
suddenly went from him and the unfinished curse died out in a gasp
Gunner Barnabas had put up one of his huge feet Theres just enough
room now for you to breathe Shacklock said he an not enough
for you to try to interrupt the conversashin Im ahavin with this
gentleman Choop Turning to me Gunner Barnabas pulled at his pipe
but showed no hurry to open the conversashin I felt embarrassed
for after all the thus strangely unearthed difference between the
Gunner and the Line man was no affair of mine Dont you go said
Gunner Barnabas He had evidently been deeply moved by something He
dropped his head between his fists and looked steadily at me

I met this child ere said he at Deelallya fishback recruity
as ever was I knowed im at Deelally and I give im a latherin
at Deelally all for to keep im straight e bein such as wants
a latherin an knowin nuthin o the ways o this country Then
I meets im up here a butterflyhuntin as innercent as you
pleaseconvalessin I goes out with im butterflyhuntin and as
you see ere ashootin The gun betwixt us I saw then what I had
overlooked before a Company fowlingpiece lying among some boulders
far down the hill Gunner Barnabas continued I should ha seen where
he had abin to get that drink inside o im Presently e misses
summat Youre a bloomin fool sez I If that had been a Pathan
now I sez Damn your Pathans an you too sez e I strook it
You did not I sez I saw the bark fly Stick to your bloomin
popguns sez e an dont talk to a better man than you I laughed
there knowin what I was an what e was You laugh sez he I
laugh I sez Shacklock an for what should I not laugh sez I
Then go an laugh in Hell sez e for Ill ave none of your
laughin With that e brings up the gun yonder and looses off and I
stretches im there and guv him a little to keep im quiet and puts
im under an while I was thinkin what nex you comes down the ill
an finds us as we was

The Private was the Gunners preyI knew that the affair had fallen
as the Gunner had said for my friend is constitutionally incapable of
lyingand I recognised that in his hands lay the boys fate

What do you think said Gunner Barnabas after a silence broken
only by the convulsive breathing of the boy he was sitting on I
think nothing I said He didnt go at me Hes your property Then
an idea occurred to me Hand him over to his own Company Theyll
school him half dead Got no Compny said Gunner Barnabas Es
a convlessint draftall sixes an sevens Dont matter to them what
he did Thrash him yourself then I said Gunner Barnabas looked
at the man and smiled then caught up an arm as a mother takes up the
dimpled arm of a child and ran the sleeve and shirt up to the elbow
Look at that he said It was a pitiful arm lean and muscleless
Can you mill a man with an arm like thatsuch as I would like to mill
him an such as he deserves I tell you sir an I am not smokin
swaggering as you seeI could take that manSodger e is Lord
elp iman twis off is arms an is legs as if e was a naked
crab See here

Before I could realise what was going to happen Gunner Barnabas rose
up stooped and taking the wretched Private Shacklock by two points of
grasp heaved him up above his head The boy kicked once or twice and
then was still He was very white I could now said Gunner Barnabas
I could now chuck this man where I like Chuck him like a lump o
beef an it would not be too much for him if I chucked Can I thrash
such a man with both ands No nor yet with my right and tied behind
my back an my lef in a sling

He dropped Private Shacklock on the ground and sat upon him as before
The boy groaned as the weight settled but there was a look in his
whitelashed red eyes that was not pleasant

I do not know what I will do said Gunner Barnabas rocking himself
to and fro I know is breed an the way o the likes o them If I
was in is Compny an this ad appened an I ad struck im as I
would ha struck him twould ha all passed off an bin forgot till
the drink was in im againa month maybe or six maybe An when the
drink was frizzin in is ead he would up and loose off in the night
or the day or the evenin All acause of that millin that e would ha
forgotten in betweens That I would be deadkilled by the likes o
im an me the next strongest man but three in the British Army

Private Shacklock not so hardly pressed as he had been found breath
to say that if he could only get hold of the fowlingpiece again the
strongest man but three in the British Army would be seriously crippled
for the rest of his days Hear that said Gunner Barnabas sitting
heavily to silence his chair Hear that you that think things is
funny to put into the papers He would shoot me e would now an so
long as hes drunk or comin out o the drink e will want to shoot
me Look ahere

He turned the boys head sideways his hand round the nape of the
neck his thumb touching the angle of the jaw What do you call those
marks They were the white scars of scrofula with which Shacklock
was eaten up I told Gunner Barnabas this I dont know what that
means I call em murdermarks an signs If a man as these things on
im an drinks so long as es drunk es mada looney But that
doesnt elp if e kills you Look ahere an here The marks were
thick on the jaw and neck Stubbs ad em said Gunner Barnabas to
himself an Lancy ad em an Duggard ad em an wots come to
them Youve got em he said addressing himself to the man he
was handling like a roped calf an sooner or later youll go with the
rest of em But this time I will not do anythingexceptin keep you
here till the drinks dead in you

Gunner Barnabas resettled himself and continued Twice this afternoon
Shacklock you ave been so near dyin that I know no man more so Once
was when I stretched you an might ha wiped off your face with my
boot as you was lyin an once was when I lifted you up in my fists
Was you afraid Shacklock

I were murmured the halfstifled soldier

An once more I will show you how near you can go to Kingdom Come in
my ands He knelt by Shacklocks side the boy lying still as death
If I was to hit you here said he I would break your chest an
you would die If I was to put my and here an my other and here
I would twis your neck an you would die Privite Shacklock If I
was to put my knees here an put your ead so I would pull off your
ead Privite Shacklock an you would die If you think as how I am a
liar say so an Ill show you Do you think so

No whispered Private Shacklock not daring to move a muscle for
Barnabass hand was on his neck

Now remember went on Barnabas neither you will say nothing nor I
will say nothing o what has happened I ha put you to shame before
me an this gentleman here an that is enough But I tell you an
you give eed now it would be better for you to desert than to go on
aservin where you are now If I meets you againif my Battry lays
with your Regment an Privite Shacklock is on the rolls I will first
mill you myself till you cant see and then I will say why I strook
you You must go an look bloomin slippy about it for if you stay
so sure as God made Paythans an weve got to wipe em out youll be
loosing off o unauthorised amminitionin or out o barricks an
youll be anged for it I know your breed an I know what these ere
white marks mean Youre mad Shacklock thats alland here you
stay under me An now choop an lie still

I waited and smoked and Gunner Barnabas smoked till the shadows
lengthened on the hillside and a chilly wind began to blow At dusk
Gunner Barnabas rose and looked at his captive Drinks out o im
now he said

I cant move whimpered Shacklock Ive got the fever back again

Ill carry you said Gunner Barnabas swinging him up and preparing
to climb the hill Goodnight sir he said to me It looks pretty
doesnt it But never you forget an I wont forget neither that this
ere shiverin shakin convalescent ahangin on to my neck is a
ragin tearin devil when es lushyan e a boy

He strode up to the hill with his burden but just before he
disappeared he turned round and shouted Its the likes o im
brings shame on the likes o us Taint we ourselves selp me Gawd

HIS BROTHERS KEEPER


Whist

Cant make up a four

Poker then

Never again with you Robin Tisnt good enough old man

Seeking what he may devour murmured a third voice from behind a
newspaper Stop the punkah and make him go away

Dont talk of it on a night like this Its enough to give a man fits
Youve no enterprise Here Ive taken the trouble to come over after
dinner

On the offchance of skinning some one I dont believe you ever
crossed a horse for pleasure

Thats true I never didand there are only two Johnnies in the Club

Theyve all gone off to the Gaff

Wah Wah They must be pretty hard up for amusement Help me to a
split

Split in this weather Hi bearer do burraburra whiskeypeg
lao and just put all the barf into them that you can find

The newspaper came down with a rustle as the reader said

How the deuce dyou expect a man to improve his mind when you two are
bukking about drinks Qui hai Mera wasti bhi

Oh youre alive are you I thought pegs would fetch you out of that
Game for a little poker

Pokerpokerredhot poker Saveloy youre too generous Cant you
let a man die in peace

Whos going to die

I am please the pigs if it gets much hotter and that bearer doesnt
bring the peg quickly

All right Die away mon ami Only dont do it in the Club thats
all Cant have it littered up with dead members Houligan would
object

By Jove I think I can imagine old Houligan doing it Member dead
in the anteroom Good Gud Bless my soul Impossible to run a Club
this way Call the Babu and see if his last months bill is paid Not
paid Good Gud Bless my soul Impossible to run a Club this way Babu
attach that body till the bill is paid Revel you might just hurry
up your dying once in a way to give us the pleasure of seeing Houligan
perform

Ill die legitimately said Revel Im not going to create a fresh
scandal in the station Ill wait for heatapoplexy or whatever is
going to come and fetch me

This is pukka hotweather talk said Saveloy I come over for
a little honest poker and find two moderately sensible men Revel
and Dallston talking tombs Im sorry Ive thrown away my valuable
evening

Dyou expect us to talk about buttercups and daisies then said
Dallston

No but theres some sort of medium between those and Sudden Death

There isnt I havent seen a daisy for seven years and now I want
to die said Revel plunging luxuriously into his peg

I knew a Johnnie on the Frontier once who did began Dallston
meditatively

Half a minute Bearer cherut lao Tobacco soothes the nerves when a
man is expecting to hear a whacker We know what your Frontier stories
are Martha

Dallston had once in a misguided moment taken the part of Martha in
the burlesque of Faust and the nickname stuck

Tisnt a whacker its a fact He told me so himself

They always do Martha Ive noticed that before But what did he tell
you

He told me that he had died

Was that all Explain him

It was this way The man went down with a bad go of fever and was
off his head About the second day it struck him in the middle of the
night

Steady the Buffs Martha you arent an Irishman yet

Never mind Its too hot to put it correctly In the middle of the
night he woke up quite calm and it struck him that it would be a good
thing to diejust as it might ha struck him that it would be a good
thing to put ice on his head He lay on his bed and thought it over
and the more he thought about it the better sort of bundobust it
seemed to be He was quite calm you know and he said that he could
have sworn that he had no fever on him

Well what happened

Oh he got up and loaded his revolverhe remembers all thisand let
fly with the muzzle to his temple The thing didnt go off so he
turned it up and found hed forgot to load one chamber

Better stop the tale there We can guess whats coming

Hang it Its a true yarn Well he jammed the thing to his head
again and it missed fire and he said that he felt ready to cry with
rage he was so disgusted So he took it by the muzzle and hit himself
on the head with it

Good man Didnt it go off then

No but the blow knocked him silly and he thought he was dead He was
awfully pleased for he had been fiddling over the show for nearly half
an hour He dropped down and died When he got his wits again he was
shaking with the fever worse than ever but he had sense enough to go
and knock up the doctor and give himself into his charge as a lunatic
Then he went clean off his head till the fever wore out

Thats a good story said Revel critically I didnt think you had
it in you at this season of the year

I can believe it said the man they called Saveloy Fever makes one
do all sorts of queer things I suppose your friend was mad with it
when he discovered it would be so healthy to die

Spose so The fever must have been so bad that he felt all
rightsame way that a man who is nearly mad with drink gets to look
sober Well anyhow there was a man who died

Did he tell you what it felt like

He said that he was awfully happy until his fever came back and shook
him up Then he was sick with fear I dont wonder Hed had rather a
narrow escape

Thats nothing said Saveloy I know a man who lived

So do I said Revel Lots of em confound em

Now this takes Marthas story and its quite true

They always are said Martha Ive noticed that before

Never mind Ill forgive you But this happened to me Since you are
talking tombs Ill assist at the sance It was in  or  I have
forgotten which Anyhow it was when I was on the Utamamula Canal
Headworks and I was chumming with a man called Stovey Youve never
met him because he belongs to the Bombay side and if he isnt really
dead by this he ought to be somewhere there now He was a pukka
sweep and I hated him We divided the Canal bungalow between us and
we kept strictly to our own side of the buildings

Hold on I call What was Stovey to look at said Revel

Living picture of the King of Spadesa blackish greasy sort of
ruffian who hadnt any pretence of manners or form He used to dine in
the kit he had been messing about the Canal in all day and I dont
believe he ever washed He had the embankments to look after and I was
in charge of the headworks but he was always contriving to fall foul
of me if he possibly could

I know that sort of man Mullane of Ghoridasahs built that way

Dont know Mullane but Stovey was a sweep Canal work isnt exactly
cheering and it doesnt take you into much society We were like a
couple of rats in a burrow grubbing and scooping all day and turning
in at night into the barn of a bungalow Well this man Stovey didnt
get fever He was so coated with dirt that I dont believe the fever
could have got at him He just began to go mad

Cheerful What were the symptoms

Well his naturally vile temper grew infamous It was really unsafe to
speak to him and he always seemed anxious to murder a coolie or two
With me of course he restrained himself a little but he sulked like
a bear for days and days together As he was the only European society
within sixty miles you can imagine how nice it was for me Hed sit
at table and sulk and stare at the opposite wall by the hourinstead
of doing his work When I pointed out that the Government didnt send
us into these cheerful places to twiddle our thumbs he glared like
a beast Oh he was a thorough hog He had a lot of other endearing
tricks but the worst was when he began to pray

Began tohow much

Pray Hed got hold of an old copy of the War Cry and used to
read it at meals and I suppose that that on the top of tough goat
disordered his intellect One night I heard him in his room groaning
and talking at a fearful rate Next morning I asked him if hed been
taken worse Ive been engaged in prayer he said looking as black
as thunder A mans spiritual concerns are his own property One
nighthed kept up these spiritual exercises for about ten days
growing queerer and queerer every dayhe said Goodnight after
dinner and got up and shook hands with me

Bad sign that said Revel sucking industriously at his cheroot

At first I couldnt make out what the man wanted No fellow shakes
hands with a fellow hes living withleast of all such a beast as
Stovey However I was civil but the minute after hed left the room
it struck me what he was going to do If he hadnt shaken hands Id
have taken no notice I suppose This unusual effusion put me on my
guard

Curious thing You can nearly always tell when a Johnnie means pegging
out He gives himself away by some softening Its human nature What
did you do

Called him back and asked him what the this and that he meant by
interfering with my coolies in the day He was generally hampering
my men but I had never taken any notice of his vagaries till then
In another minute we were arguing away hammer and tongs If it had
been any other man Id a simply thrown the lamp at his head He was
calling me all the mean names under the sun accusing me of misusing my
authority and goodness only knows what all When he had talked himself
down one stretch I had only to say a few words to start him off again
as fresh as a daisy On my word this jabbering went on for nearly
three hours

Why didnt you get coolies and have him tied up if you thought he was
mad asked Revel

Not a safe business believe me Wrongful restraint on your own
responsibility of a man nearly your own standing looks ugly Well
Stovey went on bullying me and complaining about everything Id ever
said or done since I came on the Canal tillhe went fast asleep

Whaat

Went off dead asleep just as if hed been drugged I thought the
brute had had a fit at first but there he was with his head hanging
a little on one side and his mouth open I knocked up his bearer and
told him to take the man to bed We carried him off and shoved him on
his charpoy He was still asleep and I didnt think it worth while
to undress him The fit whatever it was had worked itself out and
he was limp and used up But as I was going to leave the room and
went to turn the lamp down I looked in the glass and saw that he was
watching me between his eyelids When I spun round he seemed asleep
Thats your game is it I thought and I stood over him long enough
to see that he was shamming Then I cast an eye round the room and
saw his Martini in the corner We were all bullumteers on the Canal
works I couldnt find the cartridges so to make all serene I knocked
the breechpin out with the cleaningrod and went to my own room I
didnt go to sleep for some time About one oclockour rooms were
only divided by a door of sorts and my bed was close to itI heard
my friend open a chest of drawers Then he went for the Martini Of
course the breechblock came out with a rattle Then he went back to
bed again and I nearly laughed

Next morning he was doing the genial hailfellowwellmet trick
Said he was afraid hed lost his temper overnight and apologised for
it About half way through breakfasthe was talking thickly about
everything and anythinghe said hed come to the conclusion that a
beard was a beastly nuisance and made one stuffy He was going to shave
his Would I lend him my razors Oh youre a crafty beast you are
I said to myself I told him that I was of the other opinion and
finding my razors nearly worn out had chucked them into the Canal only
the night before He gave me one look under his eyebrows and went on
with his breakfast I was in a stew lest the man should cut his throat
with one of the breakfast knives so I kept one eye on him most of the
time

Before I left the bungalow I caught old Jeewun Singh one of the
mistries on the gates and gave him strict orders that he was to
keep in sight of the Sahib wherever he went and whatever he did and
if he did or tried to do anything foolish such as jumping down the
well Jeewun Singh was to stop him The old man tumbled at once and
I was easier in my mind when I saw how he was shadowing Stovey up and
down the works Then I sat down and wrote a letter to old Baggs the
Civil Surgeon at Chemanghath about sixty miles off telling him how
we stood The runner left about three oclock Jeewun Singh turned up
at the end of the day and gave a full true and particular account of
Stoveys doings Dyou know what the brute had done

Spare us the agony Kill him straight off Saveloy

Hed stopped the runner opened the bag read my letter and torn it
up There were only two letters in the bag both of which Id written
I was pretty average angry but I lay low At dinner he said hed got
a touch of dysentery and wanted some chlorodyne For a man anxious to
depart this life he was about as badly equipped as you could wish
Hadnt even a medicinechest to play with He was no more suffering
from dysentery than I but I said Id give him the chlorodyne and so
I didfifteen drops mixed in a wineglass and when he asked for the
bottle I said that I hadnt any more

That night he began praying again and I just lay in bed and
shuddered He was invoking the most blasphemous curses on my headall
in a whisper for fear of waking me upfor frustrating what he called
his great and holy purpose You never heard anything like it But as
long as he was praying I knew he was alive and he ran his praying half
through the night

Well for the next ten days he was apparently quite rational but I
watched him and told Jeewun Singh to watch him like a cat I suppose he
wanted to throw me off my guard but I wasnt to be thrown I grew thin
watching him Baggs wrote in to say he had gone on tour and couldnt be
found anywhere in particular for another six weeks It was a ghastly
time

One day old Jeewun Singh turned up with a bit of paper that Stovey
had given to one of the lohars as a naksha I thought it was mean
work spying into another mans very plans but when I saw what was on
the paper I gave old Jeewun Singh a rupee It was a beautiful little
breechpin The oneidead idiot had gone back to Martini I never
dreamt of such persistence Tell me when the lohar gives it to the
Sahib I said and I felt more comfy for a few days Even if Jeewun
Singh hadnt split I should have known when the new breechpin was
made The brute came in to dinner with a dashed confident triumphant
air as if hed done me in the eye at last and all through dinner he
was fiddling in his waistcoat pocket He went to bed early I went
too and I put my head against the door and listened like a woman I
must have been shivering in my pyjamas for about two hours before my
friend went for the dismantled Martini He could not get the breechpin
to fit at first He rummaged about and then I heard a file go That
seemed to make too much noise to suit his fancy so he opened the door
and went out into the compound and I heard him about fifty yards off
filing in the dark at that breechpin as if he had been possessed
Well he was you know Then he came back to the light cursing me
for keeping him out of his rest and the peace of Abrahams bosom As
soon as I heard him taking up the Martini I ran round to his door and
tried to enter gaily as the stage directions say Lend me your gun
old man if youre awake I said Theres a howling big brute of a
pariah in my room and I want to get a shot at it I pretended not
to notice that he was standing over the gun but just pranced up and
caught hold of it He turned round with a jump and said Im sick of
this Ill see that dog and if its another of your lies Ill You
know Im not a moral man

Hear hear drowsily from Martha

But I simply darent repeat what he said All right I said still
hanging on to the gun Come along and well bowl him over He
followed me into my room with a face like a fiend in torment And
as truly as Im yarning here there was a huge brindled beast of a
pariah sitting on my bed

Tall sir tall But go on The audience is now awake

Hang it Could I have invented that pariah Stovey dropped of the gun
and flopped down in a corner and yowled I went ee ki ri ki re
like a woman in hysterics pitched the gun forward and loosed off
through a window

And the pariah

He quitted for the time being Stovey was in an awful state He swore
the animal hadnt been there when I called him That was true enough I
firmly believe Providence put it there to save me from being killed by
the infuriated Stovey

Youve too lively a belief in Providence altogether What happened

Stovey tried to recover himself and pass it all over but he let me
keep the gun and went to bed About two days afterwards old Baggs
turned up on tour and I told him Stovey wanted watchingmore than
I could give him I dont know whether Baggs or the pi did it but
he didnt throw any more suicidal splints I was transferred a little
while afterwards

Ever meet the man again

Yes once at Sheik Katan dk bungalowtrailing the big brindle pi
after him

Oh it was real then I thought it was arranged for the occasion

Not a bit It was a pukka pi Stovey seemed to remember me in the
same way that a horse seems to remember I fancy his brain was a
little cloudy We tiffined togetherafter the pi had been fed
if you pleaseand Stovey said to me See that dog He saved my life
once Oh by the way I believe you were there too werent you I
shouldnt care to work with Stovey again

                                   

There was a holy pause in the smokingroom of the Toopare Club

What I like about Saveloys play said Martha looking at the
ceiling is the beautifully artistic way in which he follows up a
flush with a full Go to bed old man

SLEIPNER LATE THURINDA

 There are men both good and wise who hold that in a future state
   Dumb creatures we have cherished here below
 Will give us joyous welcome as we pass the Golden Gate
   Is it folly if I hope it may be so

 The Place Where the Old Horse Died


If there were any explanation available here I should be the first
person to offer it Unfortunately there is not and I am compelled to
confine myself to the facts of the case as vouched for by Hordene and
confirmed by Guj who is the last man in the world to throw away a
valuable horse for nothing

Jale came up with Thurinda to the Shayid Spring meeting and
besides Thurinda his string included Divorce Megs Diversions
and Benoniponies of sorts He won the Officers Scurryfive
furlongswith Benoni on the first day and that sent up the price of
the stable in the evening lotteries for Benoni was the worstlooking
of the three being a pigeontoed splitchested dk horse with a
wonderful gift of blundering in on his shouldersridden out to the
last ouncebut first Next day Jale was riding Divorce in the
Wattle and Dab Stakesround the jump course and she turned over at
the onandoff course when she was leading and managed to break her
neck She never stirred from the place where she dropped and Jale did
not move either till he was carried off the ground to his tent close
to the big shamiana where the lotteries were held He had ricked his
back and everything below the hips was as dead as timber Otherwise he
was perfectly well The doctor said that the stiffness would spread and
that he would die before the next morning Jale insisted upon knowing
the worst and when he heard it sent a pencil note to the Honorary
Secretary saying that they were not to stop the races or do anything
foolish of that kind If he hung on till the next day the nominations
for the third days racing would not be void and he would settle up
all claims before he threw up his hand This relieved the Honorary
Secretary because most of the horses had come from a long distance
and under any circumstance even had the Judge dropped dead in the
box it would have been impossible to have postponed the racing There
was a great deal of money on the third day and five or six of the
owners were gentlemen who would make even one days delay an excuse
Well settling would not be easy No one knew much about Jale He was
an outsider from down country but every one hoped that since he was
doomed he would live through the third day and save trouble

Jale lay on his charpoy in the tent and asked the doctor and the man
who catered to the refreshmentshe was the nearest at the timeto
witness his will I dont know how long my arms will be workable
said Jale and wed better get this business over The private
arrangements of the will concern nobody but Jales friends but there
was one clause that was rather curious Who was that man with the
brindled hair who put me up for a night until the tent was ready The
man who rode down to pick me up when I was smashed Nice sort of fellow
he seemed Hordene said the doctor Yes Hordene Good chap
Hordene He keeps Bull whisky Write down that I give this Johnnie
Hordene Thurinda for his own if he can sell the other ponies
Thurindas a good mare He can enter herpostentryfor the All
Horse Sweep if he likeson the last day Have you got that down I
suppose the Stewardsll recognise the gift No trouble about that
said the doctor All right Give him the other two ponies to sell
Theyre entered for the last day but I shall be dead then Tell him to
send the money to Here he gave an address Now Ill sign and you
sign and thats all This deadness is coming up between my shoulders

Jale lived dying very slowly till the third days racing and up
till the time of the lotteries on the fourth days racing The doctor
was rather surprised Hordene came in to thank him for his gift and
to suggest it would be much better to sell Thurinda with the others
She was the best of them all and would have fetched twelve hundred on
her lookingover merits only Dont you bother said Jale You take
her I rather liked you Ive got no people and that Bull whisky was
firstclass stuff Im pegging out now I think

The lotterytent outside was beginning to fill and Jale heard the
click of the dice Thats all right said he I wish I was there
butImgoing to the drawer Then he died quietly Hordene went into
the lotterytent after calling the doctor Hows Jale said the
Honorary Secretary Gone to the drawer said Hordene settling into
a chair and reaching out for a lottery paper Poor beggar said the
Honorary Secretary Twasnt the fault of our onandoff though The
mare blundered Gentlemen gentlemen Nine hundred and eighty rupees
in the lottery and River of Years for sale The lottery lasted
far into the night and there was a supplementary lottery on the All
Horse Sweep where Thurinda sold for a song and was not bought by
her owner Its not lucky said Hordene and the rest of the men
agreed with him I ride her myself but I dont know anything about
her and I wish to goodness I hadnt taken her said he Oh bosh
Never refuse a horse or a drink however you come by them No one
objects do they Not going to refer this matter to Calcutta are we
Here somebody bid Eleven hundred and fifty rupees in the lottery
and Thurindaabsolutely unknown acquired under the most romantic
circumstances from about the toughest man it has ever been my good
fortune to meetfor sale Hullo Nurji is that you Gentlemen where
a Pagan bids shall enlightened Christians hang back Ten Going going
gone You want haaf sar said the battered native trainer to
Hordene No thanksnot a bit of her for me

The All Horse Sweep was run and won by Thurinda by about a street
and threequarters to be very accurate amid derisive cheers which
Hordene who flattered himself that he knew something about riding
could not understand On pulling up he looked over his shoulder and
saw that the second horse was only just passing the box Now how did
I make such a fool of myself he said as he returned to weigh out
His friends gathered round him and asked tenderly whether this was
the first time that he had got up and whether it was absolutely
necessary that the winning horse should be ridden out when the field
were hopelessly pumped a quarter of a mile behind etc etc
IIthought River of Years was pressing me explained Hordene
River of Years was wallowing absolutely wallowing said a man
before you turned into the straight You rode like ahang itlike a
Militia subaltern

The Shayid Spring meeting broke up and the sportsmen turned their
steps towards the next carcasethe Ghoriah Spring With them went
Thurindas owner the happy possessor of an almost perfect animal
Shes as easy as a Pullman car and about twice as fast he was wont
to say in moments of confidence to his intimates For all her bulk
shes as handy as a polopony a child might ride her and when shes
at the post shes as cuteshes as cute as the bally starter himself
Many times had Hordene said this till at last one unsympathetic
friend answered with When a man bukhs too much about his wife or
his horse its a sure sign hes trying to make himself like em I
mistrust your Thurinda Shes too good or else Or else what
Youre trying to believe you like her Like her I love her I
trust that darling as Im shot if Id trust you Id hack her for
tuppence Hack away then I dont want to hurt your feelings I
dont hack my stable myself but some horses go better for it Come and
peacock at the bandstand this evening To the bandstand accordingly
Hordene came and the lovely Thurinda comported herself with all the
gravity and decorum that might have been expected Hordene rode home
with the scoffer through the dusk discoursing on matters indifferent
Hold up a minute said his friend theres Gagley riding behind
us Then raising his voice Come along Gagley I want to speak
to you about the Race Ball But no Gagley came and the couple went
forward at a trot Hang it Theres that man behind us still
Hordene listened and could clearly hear the sound of a horse trotting
apparently just behind them Come on Gagley Dont play bopeep in
that ridiculous way shouted the friend Again no Gagley Twenty yards
farther there was a crash and a stumble as the friends horse came down
over an unseen rathole How much damaged asked Hordene Sprained
my wrist was the dolorous answer and there is something wrong with
my kneecap There goes my mount tomorrow and this gee is cut like a
cabhorse

On the first day of the Ghoriah meeting Thurinda was hopelessly
ridden out by a native jockey to whose care Hordene had at the last
moment been compelled to confide her You forsaken idiot said
he what made you begin riding as soon as you were clear She had
everything safe if youd only left her alone You rode her out before
the home turn you hog What could I do said the jockey sullenly
I was pressed by another horse Whose other horse There were
twenty yards of daylight between you and the ruck If youd kept her
there even then twouldnt ha mattered But you rode her outyou
rode her out There was another horse and he pressed me to the end
and when I looked round he was no longer there Let us in charity
draw a veil over Hordenes language at this point Goodness knows
whether shell be fit to pull out again for the last event Dn you
and your other horses I wish Id broken your neck before letting you
get up Thurinda was done to a turn and it seemed a cruelty to
ask her to run again in the last race of the day Hordene rode this
time and was careful to keep the mare within herself at the outset
Once more Thurinda left her fieldwith one exceptiona grey horse
that hung upon her flanks and could not be shaken off The mare was
done and refused to answer the call upon her She tried hopelessly
in the straight and was caught and passed by her old enemy River
of Yearsthe chestnut of Kurnaul You rode welllike a native
Hordene was the unflattering comment The mare was ridden out before
River of Years But the grey began Hordene and then ceased for
he knew that there was no grey in the race Blue Point and Diamond
Dust the only greys at the meeting were running in the Arab Handicap

He caught his native jockey What horse dyou say pressed you I
dont know It was a grey with nutmeg tickings behind the saddle
That evening Hordene sought the great Major BlareTyndar who knew
personally the father mother and ancestors of almost every horse
brought from ekka or ship that had ever set foot on an Indian
racecourse Say Major what is a grey horse with nutmeg tickings
behind the saddle A curiosity Wendell Holmes is a grey with
nutmeg on the near shoulder but there is no horse marked your way
now Then after a pause No Im wrongyou ought to know The pony
that got you Thurinda was grey and nutmeg How much Divorce
of course The mare that broke her neck at the Shayid meeting and
killed Jale A big thirteenthree she was I recollect when she was
hacking old Snuffy Beans to office He bought her from a dealer who
had her left on his hands as a rejection when the Pink Hussars were
buying team up country and thenHullo The mans gone Hordene
had departed on receipt of information which he already knew He only
demanded extra confirmation Then he began to argue with himself
bearing in mind that he himself was a sane man neither gluttonous nor
a winebibber with an unimpaired digestion and that Thurinda was to
all appearance a horse of ordinary flesh and exceedingly good blood
Arrived at these satisfactory conclusions he reargued the whole matter

Being by nature intensely superstitious he decided upon scratching
Thurinda and facing the howl of indignation that would follow He
also decided to leave the Ghoriah meet and change his luck But it
would have been sinfulpositively wickedto have left without waiting
for the polomatch that was to conclude the festivities At the last
moment before the match one of the leading players of the Ghoriah team
and Hordenes host discovered that through the kindly foresight of his
head sais every single pony had been taken down to the ground Lend
me a hack old man he shouted to Hordene as he was changing Take
Thurinda was the reply Shell bring you down in ten minutes
And Thurinda was accordingly saddled for Marishs benefit Ill
go down with you said Hordene The two rode off together at a hand
canter By Jove Somebodys sais ll get kicked for this said
Marish looking round Look there Hes coming for the mare Pull
out into the middle of the road What on earth dyou mean Well
if you can take a strayed horse so calmly I cant Didnt you see
what a lather that grey was in What grey The grey that just
passed ussaddle and all Hes got away from the ground I suppose
Now hes turned the corner but you can hear his hoofs Listen There
was a furious gallop of shod horses gradually dying into silence
Come along said Hordene Were late as it is We shall know all
about it on the ground Anybody lost a tat asked Marish cheerily
as they reached the ground No weve lost you Double up Youre
late enough as it is Get up and go in The teams are waiting Marish
mounted his polopony and cantered across Hordene watched the game
idly for a few moments There was a scrimmage a cloud of dust and a
cessation of play and a shouting for saises The umpire clattered
forward and returned What has happened Marish Neck broken
Nobodys fault Pony crossed its legs and came down Games stopped
Thank God he hasnt got a wife Again Hordene pondered as he sat on
his horses back Under any circumstances it was written that he was
to be killed I had no interest in his death and he had his warning
I suppose I cant make out the system that this infernal mare runs
under Why him Anyway Ill shoot her He looked at Thurinda the
calmeyed the beautiful and repented No Ill sell her

What in the world has happened to Thurinda that Hordene is so keen
on getting rid of her was the general question I want money said
Hordene unblushingly and the few who knew how his accounts stood saw
that this was a varnished lie But they held their peace because of
the great love and trust that exists among the ancient and honourable
fraternity of sportsmen

Theres nothing wrong with her explained Hordene Try her as much
as you like but let her stay in my stable until youve made up your
mind one way or the other Nine hundreds my price

Ill take her at that quoth a redhaired subaltern nicknamed
Carrots later Gaja and then for brevitys sake Guj Let me have
her out this afternoon I want her more for hacking than anything else

Guj tried Thurinda exhaustively and had no fault to find with her
Shes all right he said briefly Ill take her Its a cash deal
Virtuous Guj said Hordene pocketing the cheque If you go on like
this youll be loved and respected by all who know you

A week later Guj insisted that Hordene should accompany him on a ride
They cantered merrily for a time Then said the subaltern Listen to
the mares beat a minute will you Seems to me that youve sold me two
horses

Behind the mare was plainly audible the cadence of a swiftly trotting
horse Dyou hear anything said Guj Nonothing but the regular
triplet said Hordene and he lied when he answered Guj looked at
him keenly and said nothing Two or three months passed and Hordene
was perplexed to see his old property running and running well under
the curious title of Sleipnerlate Thurinda He consulted the
Great Major who said I dont know a horse called Sleipner but
I know of one He was a northern bred and belonged to Odin A
mythological beast Exactly Like Bucephalus and the rest of em
He was a great horse I wish I had some of his get in my stable
Why Because he had eight legs When he had used up one set he let
down the other four to come up the straight on Stewards were lenient
in those days Now its all you can do to get a crock with three
sound legs

Hordene cursed the redhaired Guj in his heart for finding out the
mares peculiarity Then he cursed the dead man Jale for his ridiculous
interference with a free gift If it was givenit was given said
Hordene and he has no right to come messing about after it When Guj
and he next met he enquired tenderly after Thurinda The redhaired
subaltern impassive as usual answered Ive shot her Wellyou
know your own affairs best said Hordene Youve given yourself
away said Guj What makes you think I shot a sound horse She might
have been bitten by a mad dog or lamed You didnt say that No
I didnt because Ive a notion that you knew what was wrong with her
Wrong with her She was as sound as a bell I know that Dont
pretend to misunderstand Youll believe me and Ill believe you
in this show but no one else will believe us That mare was a bally
nightmare Go on said Hordene I stuck the noise of the other
horse as long as I could and called her Sleipner on the strength
of it Sleipner was a stallion but thats a detail When it got to
interfering with every race I rode it was more than I could stick
I took her off racing and on my honour since that time Ive been
nearly driven out of my mind by a grey and nutmeg pony It used to trot
round my quarters at night fool about the Mall and graze about the
compound You know that pony It isnt a pony to catch or ride or
hit is it No said Hordene Ive seen it So I shot Thurinda
that was a thousand rupees out of my pocket And old Stiffer whos got
his new crematorium in full blast cremated her I say what was the
matter with the mare Was she bewitched

Hordene told the story of the gift which Guj heard out to the end
Now thats a nice sort of yarn to tell in a messroom isnt it
Theyd call it jumps or insanity said Guj Theres no reason in it
It doesnt lead up to anything It only killed poor Marish and made you
stick me with the mare and yet its true Are you mad or drunk or am
I Thats the only explanation Cant be drunk for nine months on
end and madness would show in that time said Hordene

All right said Guj recklessly going to the window Ill lay that
ghost He leaned out into the night and shouted Jale Jale Jale
Wherever you are There was a pause and then up the compounddrive
came the clatter of a horses feet The redhaired subaltern blanched
under his freckles to the colour of glycerine soap Thurindas
dead he muttered andand all bets are off Go back to your grave
again

Hordene was watching him openmouthed

Now bring me a straitjacket or a glass of brandy said Guj Thats
enough to turn a mans hair white What did the poor wretch mean by
knocking about the earth

Dont know whispered Hordene hoarsely Lets get over to the Club
Im feeling a bit shaky

A SUPPLEMENTARY CHAPTER

 Shall I not one day remember thy Bower
   One day when all days are one day to me
 Thinking I stirred not and yet had the power
   Yearningah God if again it might be

                 The Song of the Bower


This is a base betrayal of confidence but the sin is Mrs Hauksbees
and not mine

If you remember a certain foolish tale called The Education of Otis
Yeere you will not forget that Mrs Mallowe laughed at the wrong
time which was a single and at Mrs Hauksbee which was a double
offence An experiment had gone wrong and it seems that Mrs Mallowe
had said some quaint things about the experimentrix

I am not angry said Mrs Hauksbee and I admire Polly in spite
of her evil counsels to me But I shall waitI shall wait like the
frog footman in Alice in Wonderland and Providence will deliver
Polly into my hands It always does if you wait And she departed
to vex the soul of the Hawley boy who says that she is singularly
uninstruite and childlike He got that first word out of a Ouida
novel I do not know what it means but am prepared to make an
affidavit before the Collector that it does not mean Mrs Hauksbee

Mrs Hauksbees ideas of waiting are very liberal She told the Hawley
boy that he dared not tell Mrs Reiver that she was an intellectual
woman with a gift for attracting men and she offered another man
two waltzes if he would repeat the same thing in the same ears But
he said Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes which means Mistrust all
waltzes except those you get for legitimate asking

The Hawley boy did as he was told because he believes in Mrs
Hauksbee He was the instrument in the hand of a Higher Power and
he wore jharun coats like the scoriac rivers that roll their
sulphurous torrents down Yahek in the realms of the Boreal Pole
that made your temples throb when seen early in the morning I will
introduce him to you some day if all goes well He is worth knowing

Unpleasant things have already been written about Mrs Reiver in other
places

She was a person without invention She used to get her ideas from the
men she captured and this led to some eccentric changes of character
For a month or two she would act  la Madonna and try Theo for a
change if she fancied Theos ways suited her beauty Then she would
attempt the dark and fiery Lilith and so and so on exactly as she
had absorbed the new notion But there was always Mrs Reiverhard
selfish stupid Mrs Reiverat the back of each transformation Mrs
Hauksbee christened her the Magic Lantern on account of this borrowed
mutability It just depends upon the slide said Mrs Hauksbee The
case is the only permanent thing in the exhibition But that thank
Heaven is getting old

There was a Fancy Ball at Government House and Mrs Reiver came
attired in some sort of  costume with her hair pulled up to the
top of her head showing the clear outline on the back of the neck
like the Rcamier engravings Mrs Hauksbee had chosen to be loud not
to say vulgar that evening and went as The Black Deatha curious
arrangement of barred velvet black domino and flamecoloured satin
puffery coming up to the neck and the wrists with one of those
shrieking keelbacked cicalas in the hair The scream of the creature
made people jump It sounded so unearthly in a ballroom

I heard her say to some one Let me introduce you to Madame Rcamier
and I saw a man dressed as Autolycus bowing to Mrs Reiver while The
Black Death looked more than usually saintly It was a very pleasant
evening and Autolycus and Madame RcamierI heard her ask Autolycus
who Madame Rcamier was by the waydanced together ever so much
Mrs Hauksbee was in a meditative mood but she laughed once or twice
in the back of her throat and that meant trouble

Autolycus was Trewinnard the man whom Mrs Mallowe had told Mrs
Hauksbee aboutthe Platonic Paragon as Mrs Hauksbee called him He
was amiable but his moustache hid his mouth and so he did not explain
himself all at once If you stared at him he turned his eyes away
and through the rest of the dinner kept looking at you to see whether
you were looking again He took stares as a tribute to his merits
which were generally known and recognised When he played billiards he
apologised at length between each bad stroke and explained what would
have happened if the red had been somewhere else or the bearer had
trimmed the third lamp or the wind hadnt made the door bang Also
he wriggled in his chair more than was becoming to one of his inches
Little men may wriggle and fidget without attracting notice It doesnt
suit bigframed men He was the Main Girder Boom of the Kutcha Pukka
Bundobust and Benaoti Department and corresponded direct with the Three
Taped Bashaw Every one knows what that means The men in his own
office said that where anything was to be gained even temporarily he
would never hesitate for a moment over handing up a subordinate to be
hanged and drawn and quartered He didnt back up his underlings and
for that reason they dreaded taking responsibility on their shoulders
and the strength of the Department was crippled

A weak Department can and often does do a power of good work simply
because its chief sees it through thick and thin Mistakes may be
born of this policy but it is safe and sounder than giving orders
which may be read in two ways and reserving to yourself the right of
interpretation according to subsequent failure or success Offices
prefer administration to diplomacy They are very like Empires

Hatchett of the Almirah and Thannicutcha vicious little
threecornered Department that was always stamping on the toes of the
Electhad the fairest estimate of Trewinnard when he said I dont
believe he is as good as he is They always quoted that verdict as
an instance of the blind jealousy of the Uncovenanted but Hatchett
was quite right Trewinnard was just as good and no better than Mrs
Mallowe could make him and she had been engaged on the work for three
years Hatchett has a narrowminded partiality for the more than
nakedthe anatomised Truthbut he can gauge a man

Trewinnard had been spoilt by overmuch petting and the devil of
vanity that rides nine hundred and ninetynine men out of a thousand
made him behave as he did He had been too long one womans property
and that belief will sometimes drive a man to throw the best things in
the world behind him from rank perversity Perhaps he only meant to
stray temporarily and then return but in arranging for this excursion
he misunderstood both Mrs Mallowe and Mrs Reiver The one made no
sign she would have died first and the otherwell the highfalutin
mindsome lay was her craze for the time being She had never tried it
before and several men had hinted that it would eminently become her
Trewinnard was in himself pleasant with the great merit of belonging
to somebody else He was what they call intellectual and vain to
the marrow Mrs Reiver returned his lead in the first and hopelessly
outtrumped him in the second suit Put down all that comes after this
to Providence or The Black Death

Trewinnard never realised how far he had fallen from his allegiance
till Mrs Reiver referred to some official matter that he had been
telling her about as ours He remembered then how that word had been
sacred to Mrs Mallowe and how she had asked his permission to use it
Opium is intoxicating and so is whisky but more intoxicating than
either to a certain build of mind is the first occasion on which a
womanespecially if she have asked leave for the honouridentifies
herself with a mans work The second time is not so pleasant The
answer has been given before and the treachery comes to the top and
tastes coppery in the mouth

Trewinnard swallowed the shamehe felt dimly that he was not doing
Mrs Reiver any great wrong by untruthand told and told and continued
to tell for the snare of this form of openheartedness is that no man
unless he be a consummate liar knows where to stop The office door of
all others must be either open wide or shut tight with a shaprassi to
keep off callers

Mrs Mallowe made no sign to show that she felt Trewinnards desertion
till a piece of information that could only have come from one
quarter ran about Simla like quicksilver She met Trewinnard at a
dinner Choose your confidantes better Harold she whispered as
she passed him in the drawingroom He turned salmoncolour and swore
very hard to himself that Babu Durga Charan Laha must gomust gomust
go He almost believed in that greyheaded old oysters guilt

And so another of those upsidedown tragedies that we call a Simla
Season wore through to the endfrom the Birthday Ball to the
tripping to Naldera and Kotghar And fools gave feasts and wise men
ate them and they were bidden to the wedding and sat down to bake and
those who had nuts had no teeth and they staked the substance for the
shadow and carried coals to Newcastle and in the dark all cats were
grey as it was in the days of the great Cur of Meudon

Late in the year there developed itself a battleroyal between the
KPB and B Department and the Almirah and Thannicutch Three columns
of this paper would be needed to supply you with the outlines of the
difficulty and then you would not be grateful Hatchett snuffed the
fray from afar and went into it with his teeth bared to the gums while
his Department stood behind him solid to a man They believed in him
and their answer to the fury of men who detested him was Ah But
youll admit hes dd right in what he says

The head of Trewinnard in a Government Resolution said Hatchett
and he told the daftri to put a new pad on his blotter and smiled
a bleak smile as he spread out his notes Hatchett is a Thug in his
systematic way of butchering a mans reputation

What are you going to do asked Trewinnards Department Sit tight
said Trewinnard which was tantamount to saying Lord knows The
Department groaned and said Which of us poor beggars is to be Jonahed
this time They knew Trewinnards vice

The dispute was essentially not one for the KPB and B under its
then direction to fight out It should have been compromised or at the
worst sent up to the Supreme Government with a private and confidential
note directing justice into the proper paths

Some people say that the Supreme Government is the Devil It is more
like the Deep Sea Anything that you throw into it disappears for
weeks and comes to light hacked and furred at the edges crusted with
weeds and shells and almost unrecognisable The bold man who would dare
to give it a file of loveletters would be amply rewarded It would
overlay them with original comments and marginal notes and work them
piecemeal into DO dockets Few things from a setter or a whirlpool
to a sausagemachine or a hatching hen are more interesting and
peculiar than the Supreme Government

What shall we do said Trewinnard who had fallen from grace into
sin Fight said Mrs Reiver or words to that effect and no one
can say how far aimless desire to test her powers and how far belief
in the man she had brought to her feet prompted the judgment Of the
merits of the case she knew just as much as any ayah

Then Mrs Mallowe upon an evil word that went through Simla put on
her visitinggarb and attired herself for the sacrifice and went to
callto call upon Mrs Reiver knowing what the torture would be
From halfpast twelve till twentyfive minutes to two she sat her
hand upon her cardcase and let Mrs Reiver stab at her all for the
sake of the information Mrs Reiver doubleacted her part but she
played into Mrs Mallowes hand by this defect The assumptions of
ownership the little intentional slips were overdone and so also
was the pretence of intimate knowledge Mrs Mallowe never winced She
repeated to herself And he has trusted thisthis Thing She knows
nothing and she cares nothing and she has digged this trap for him
The main feature of the case was abundantly clear Trewinnard whose
capacities Mrs Mallowe knew to the utmost farthing to whom public
and departmental petting were as the breath of his delicatelycut
nostrilsTrewinnard with his nervous dread of dispraise was
to be pitted against the Paul de Cassagnac of the Almirah and
Thannicutchthe unspeakable Hatchett who fought with the venom of a
woman and the skill of a Red Indian Unless his cause was triply just
Trewinnard was already under the guillotine and if he had been under
this Things dominance small hope for the justice of his case Oh
why did I let him go without putting out a hand to fetch him back
said Mrs Mallowe as she got into her rickshaw

Now Tim her foxterrier is the only person who knows what Mrs
Mallowe did that afternoon and as I found him loafing on the Mall in
a very disconsolate condition and as he recognised me effusively and
suggested going for a monkeyhunta thing he had never done beforemy
impression is that Mrs Mallowe stayed at home till the light fell and
thought If she did this it is of course hopeless to account for her
actions So you must fill in the gap for yourself

That evening it rained heavily and horses mired their riders But not
one of all the habits was so plastered with mud as the habit of Mrs
Mallowe when she pulled up under the scrub oaks and sent in her name by
the astounded bearer to Trewinnard Folly downright folly she said
as she sat in the steam of the dripping horse But its all a horrible
jumble together

It may be as well to mention that ladies do not usually call upon
bachelors at their houses Bachelors would scream and run away
Trewinnard came into the light of the verandah with a nervous
undecided smile upon his lips and he wishedin the bottomless bottom
of his bad hearthe wished that Mrs Reiver was there to see A minute
later he was profoundly glad that he was alone for Mrs Mallowe was
standing in his office room and calling him names that reflected no
credit on his intellect What have you done What have you said she
asked Be quick Be quick And have the horse led round to the back
Can you speak What have you written Show me

She had interrupted him in the middle of what he was pleased to call
his reply for Hatchetts first shell had already fallen in the camp
He stood back and offered her the seat at the duftar table Her elbow
left a great wet stain on the baize for she was soaked through and
through

Say exactly how the matter stands she said and laughed a weak
little laugh which emboldened Trewinnard to say loftily Pardon me
Mrs Mallowe but I hardly recognise your

Idiot Will you show me the papers will you speak and will you be
quick

Her most reverent admirers would hardly have recognised the
softspoken slowgestured quieteyed Mrs Mallowe in the indignant
woman who was drumming on Trewinnards desk He submitted to the voice
of authority as he had submitted in the old times and explained as
quickly as might be the cause of the war between the two Departments
In conclusion he handed over the rough sheets of his reply As she read
he watched her with the expectant sickly halfsmile of the unaccustomed
writer who is doubtful of the success of his work And another smile
followed but died away as he saw Mrs Mallowe read his production
All the old phrases out of which she had so carefully drilled him had
returned the unpruned fluency of diction was there the more luxuriant
for being so long cut back the reckless riotousness of assertion that
sacrificed alleven the vital truth that Hatchett would be so sure
to take advantage offor the sake of scoring a point was there and
through and between every line ran the weak wilful vanity of the man
Mrs Mallowes mouth hardened

And you wrote this she said Then to herself He wrote this

Trewinnard stepped forward with a gesture habitual to him when he
wished to explain Mrs Reiver had never asked for explanations She
had told him that all his ways were perfect Therefore he loved her

Mrs Mallowe tore up the papers one by one saying as she did so
You were going to cross swords with Hatchett Do you know your
own strength Oh Harold Harold it is too pitiable I thoughtI
thought Then the great anger that had been growing in her broke
out and she cried Oh you fool You blind blind blind trumpery
fool Why do I help you Why do I have anything to do with you You
miserable man Sit down and write as I dictate Quickly And I had
chosen you out of a hundred other men Write It is a terrible
thing to be found out by a mere unseeing maleThackeray has said it
It is worse far worse to be found out by a woman and in that hour
after long years to discover her worth For ten minutes Trewinnards
pen scratched across the paper and Mrs Mallowe spoke And that
is all she said bitterly As you value yourselfyour noble
honourable modest selfkeep within that

But that was not allby any means At least as far as Trewinnard was
concerned

He rose from his chair and delivered his soul of many mad and futile
thoughtssuch things as a man babbles when he is deserted of the gods
has missed his hold upon the latchdoor of Opportunityand cannot see
that the ways are shut Mrs Mallowe bore with him to the end and he
stood before herno enviable creature to look upon

A cur as well as a fool she said Will you be good enough to
tell them to bring my horse I do not trust to your honouryou have
nonebut I believe that your sense of shame will keep you from
speaking of my visit

So he was left in the verandah crying Come back like a distracted
guineafowl

                                   

Hes done us in the eye grunted Hatchett as he perused the KPB
and B reply Look at the cunning of the brute in shifting the issue
on to India in that carneying blarneying way Only wait until I can
get my knife into him again Ill stop every bolthole before the hunt
begins

                                   

Oh I believe I have forgotten to mention the success of Mrs
Hauksbees revenge It was so brilliant and overwhelming that she had
to cry in Mrs Mallowes arms for the better part of half an hour
and Mrs Mallowe was just as bad though she thanked Mrs Hauksbee
several times in the course of the interview and Mrs Hauksbee said
that she would repent and reform and Mrs Mallowe said Hush dear
hush I dont think either of us had anything to be proud of And Mrs
Hauksbee said Oh but I didnt mean it Polly I didnt mean it
And I stood with my hat in my hand trying to make two very indignant

CHATAUQUAED

  Tells how the Professor and I found the Precious Rediculouses and
  how they Chautauquaed at us Puts into print some sentiments better
  left unrecorded and proves that a neglected theory will blossom in
  congenial soil Contains fragments of three lectures and a confession

 But these in spite of careful dirt
   Are neither green nor sappy
 Half conscious of the garden squirt
   The Spendlings look unhappy


Out of the silence under the appletrees the Professor spake One leg
thrust from the hammock netting kicked lazily at the blue There was
the crisp crunch of teeth in an apple core

Get out of this said the Professor lazily As it was on the
banks of the Hughli so on the green borders of the Musquash and
the Ohioeternal unrest and the insensate desire to go ahead I
was lapped in a very trance of peace Even the apples brought no
indigestion

Permanent Nuisance what is the matter now I grunted

Glong out of this and go to Niagara said the Professor in jerks
Spread the ink of description through the waters of the Horseshoe
fallsbuy a papoose from the tame wild Indian who lives at the Clifton
Housetake a fiftycent ride on the Maid of the Mistgo over the
falls in a tub

Seriously is it worth the trouble Everybody who has ever been within
fifty miles of the falls has written his or her impressions Everybody
who has never seen the falls knows all about them andbesides I want
some more apples Theyre good in this place ye big fat man I quoted

The Professor retired into his hammock for a while Then he reappeared
flushed with a new thought If you want to see something quite new
lets go to Chautauqua

Whats that

Well its a sort of institution Its an educational idea and it
lives on the borders of a lake in New York State I think youll find
it interesting and I know it will show you a new side of American
life

In blank ignorance I consented Everybody is anxious that I should
see as many sides of American life as possible Here in the East they
demand of me what I thought of their West I dare not answer that it is
as far from their notions and motives as Hindustan from Hobokenthat
the West to this poor thinking is an America which has no kinship
with its neighbour Therefore I congratulated them hypocritically upon
their West and from their lips learn that there is yet another
America that of the Southalien and distinct Into the third
country alas I shall not have time to penetrate The newspapers and
the oratory of the day will tell you that all feeling between the
North and South is extinct None the less the Northerner outside his
newspapers and public men has a healthy contempt for the Southerner
which the latter repays by what seems very like a deeprooted aversion
to the Northerner I have learned now what the sentiments of the great
American nation mean The North speaks in the name of the country the
West is busy developing its own resources and the Southerner skulks in
his tents His opinions do not count but his girls are very beautiful

So the Professor and I took a train and went to look at the educational
idea From sleepy quiet little Musquash we rattled through the coal
and iron districts of Pennsylvania her coke ovens flaring into the
night and her clamorous foundries waking the silence of the woods in
which they lay Twenty years hence woods and cornfields will be gone
and from Pittsburg to Shenango all will be smoky black as Bradford
and Beverly for each factory is drawing to itself a small town and
year by year the demand for rails increases The Professor held forth
on the labour question his remarks being prompted by the sight of a
trainload of Italians and Hungarians going home from mending a bridge

You recollect the Burmese said he The American is like the Burman
in one way He wont do heavy manual labour He knows too much
Consequently he imports the alien to be his handsjust as the Burman
gets hold of the Madrassi If he shuts down all labour immigration he
will have to fill up his own dams cut his cuttings and pile his own
embankments The American citizen wont like that He is racially unfit
to be a labourer in muttee He can invent buy sell and design but
he cannot waste his time on earthworks Iswaste this great people
will resume contract labour immigration the minute they find the aliens
in their midst are not sufficient for the jobs in hand If the alien
gives them trouble they will shoot him

Yes they will shoot him I said remembering how only two days
before some Hungarians employed on a line near Musquash had seen fit
to strike and to roll down rocks on labourers hired to take their
places an amusement which caused the sheriff to open fire with a
revolver and wound or kill it really does not much matter which two
or three of them Only a man who earns ten pence a day in sunny Italy
knows how to howl for as many shillings in America

The composition of the crowd in the cars began to attract my attention
There were very many women and a few clergymen Where you shall find
these two together there also shall be a fad a hobby a theory or a
mission

These people are going to Chautauqua said the Professor Its a
sort of openair collegethey call itbut youll understand things
better when you arrive A grim twinkle in the back of his eye awakened
all my fears

Can you get anything to drink there

No

Are you allowed to smoke

Yees in certain places

Are we staying there over Sunday

No This very emphatically

Feminine shrieks of welcome Theres Sadie Why Maimie is that
yeou Alfs in the smoker Did you bring the baby and a profligate
expenditure of kisses between bonnet and bonnet told me we had struck
a gathering place of the clans It was midnight They swept us this
horde of clamouring women into a Black Maria omnibus and a sumptuous
hotel close to the borders of a lakeLake Chautauqua Morning
showed as pleasant a place of summer pleasuring as ever I wish to
see Smoothcut lawns of velvet grass studded with tenniscourts
surrounded the hotel and ran down to the blue waters which were dotted
with rowboats Young men in wonderful blazers and maidens in more
wonderful tennis costumes women attired with all the extravagance of
unthinking Chicago or the grace of Washington which is Simla filled
the grounds and the neat French nurses and exquisitely dressed little
children ran about together There was pickerelfishing for such as
enjoyed it a bowlingalley unlimited bathing and a toboggan besides
many other amusements all winding up with a dance or a concert at
night Women dominated the sham medival hotel rampaged about the
passages flirted in the corridors and chased unruly children off the
tenniscourts This place was called Lakewood It is a pleasant place
for the unregenerate

We go up the lake in a steamer to Chautauqua said the Professor

But I want to stay here This is what I understand and like

No you dont You must come along and be educated

All the shores of the lake which is eighteen miles long are dotted
with summer hotels camps boathouses and pleasant places of rest You
go there with all your family to fish and to flirt There is no special
beauty in the landscape of tame cultivated hills and decorous woolly
trees but good taste and wealth have taken the place in hand trimmed
its borders and made it altogether delightful

The institution of Chautauqua is the largest village on the lake
I cant hope to give you an idea of it but try to imagine the
Charlesville at Mussoorie magnified ten times and set down in the
midst of hundreds of tiny little hill houses each different from its
neighbour brightly painted and constructed of wood Add something of
the peace of dull Dalhousie flavour with a tincture of missions and
the old Polytechnic Cassells Self Educator and a Monday pop and
spread the result out flat on the shores of Naini Tal Lake which you
will please transport to the Dun But that does not half describe the
idea We watched it through a wicket gate where we were furnished with
a red ticket price forty cents and five dollars if you lost it I
naturally lost mine on the spot and was fined accordingly

Once inside the grounds on the paths that serpentined round the
myriad cottages I was lost in admiration of scores of pretty girls
most of them with little books under their arms and a pretty air
of seriousness on their faces Then I stumbled upon an elaborately
arranged mass of artificial hillocks surrounding a mud puddle and a
wormy streak of slime connecting it with another mud puddle Little
boulders topped with square pieces of putty were strewn over the
hillocksevidently with intention When I hit my foot against one such
boulder painted Jericho I demanded information in aggrieved tones

Hsh said the Professor Its a model of Palestinethe Holy
Landdone to scale and all that you know

Two young people were flirting on the top of the highest mountain
overlooking Jerusalem the mud puddles were meant for the Dead Sea and
the Sea of Galilee and the twisting gutter was the Jordan A small boy
sat on the city Safed and cast his line into Chautauqua Lake On the
whole it did not impress me The hotel was filled with women and a
large blackboard in the main hall set forth the exercises for the day
It seemed that Chautauqua was a sort of educational syndicate cum
hotel cum very mild Rosherville There were annually classes of
young women and young men who studied in the little cottages for two
or three months in the year and went away to selfeducate themselves
There were other classes who learned things by correspondence and yet
other classes made up the teachers All these delights I had missed
but had arrived just in time for a sort of debauch of lectures which
concluded the three months education The syndicate in control had
hired various lecturers whose names would draw audiences and these men
were lecturing about the labour problem the servantgirl question the
artistic and political aspect of Greek life the Pope in the Middle
Ages and similar subjects in all of which young women do naturally
take deep delight Professor Mahaffy what the devil was he doing in
that gallery was the Greek art side man and a Dr Gunsaulus handled
the Pope The latter I loved forthwith He had been to some gathering
on much the same lines as the Chautauqua one and had there been
detected in the open daylight smoking a cigar One whole lighted
cigar Then his congregation or his class or the mothers of both of
them wished to know whether this was the sort of conduct for a man
professing temperance I have not heard Dr Gunsaulus lecture but he
must be a good man Professor Mahaffy was enjoying himself I sat close
to him at tiffin and heard him arguing with an American professor as
to the merits of the American Constitution Both men spoke that the
table might get the benefit of their wisdom whence I argued that even
eminent professors are eminently human

Now for goodness sake behave yourself said the Professor
You are not to ask the whereabouts of a bar You are not to laugh
at anything you see and you are not to go away and deride this
Institution

Remember that advice But I was virtuous throughout and my virtue
brought its own reward The parlour of the hotel was full of committees
of women some of them were Methodist Episcopalians some were
Congregationalists and some were United Presbyterians and some were
faith healers and Christian Scientists and all trotted about with
notebooks in their hands and the expression of Atlas on their faces
They were connected with missions to the heathen and so forth and
their deliberations appeared to be controlled by a male missionary The
Professor introduced me to one of them as their friend from India

Indeed said she and of what denomination are you

II live in India I murmured

You are a missionary then

I had obeyed the Professors orders all too well I am not a
missionary I said with I trust a decent amount of regret in
my tones She dropped me and I went to find the Professor who had
cowardly deserted me and I think was laughing on the balcony It is
very hard to persuade a denominational American that a man from India
is not a missionary The homereturned preachers very naturally convey
the impression that India is inhabited solely by missionaries

I heard some of them talking and saw how all unconsciously they were
hinting the thing which was not But prejudice governs me against my
will When a woman looks you in the face and pities you for having to
associate with heathen and idolatersSikh Sirdar of the north if
you please Mahommedan gentlemen and the simpleminded Jat of the
Punjabwhat can you do

The Professor took me out to see the sights and lest I should be
further treated as a denominational missionary I wrapped myself in
tobacco smoke This ensures respectful treatment at Chautauqua
An amphitheatre capable of seating five thousand people is the
centrepoint of the show Here the lecturers lecture and the concerts
are held and from here the avenues start Each cottage is decorated
according to the taste of the owner and is full of girls The
verandahs are alive with them they fill the sinuous walks they hurry
from lecture to lecture hatless and three under one sunshade they
retail little confidences walking arminarm they giggle for all the
world like uneducated maidens and they walk about and row on the lake
with their very young men The lectures are arranged to suit all
tastes I got hold of one called The Eschatology of Our Saviour It
set itself to prove the length breadth and temperature of Hell from
information garnered from the New Testament I read it in the sunshine
under the trees with these hundreds of pretty maidens pretending to
be busy all round and it did not seem to match the landscape Then
I studied the faces of the crowd Onequarter were old and worn the
balance were young innocent charming and frivolous I wondered how
much they really knew or cared for the art side of Greek life or the
Pope in the Middle Ages and how much for the young men who walked with
them Also what their ideas of Hell might be We entered a place called
a museum all the shows here are of an improving tendency which had
evidently been brought together by feminine hands so jumbled were the
exhibits There was a facsimile of the Rosetta stone with some printed
popular information an Egyptian camel saddle miscellaneous truck
from the Holy Land another model of the same photographs of Rome
badlyblotched drawings of volcanic phenomena the head of the pike
that John Brown took to Harpers Ferry that time his soul went marching
on casts of doubtful value and views of Chautauqua all bundled
together without the faintest attempt at arrangement and all very
badly labelled

It was the apotheosis of Popular Information I told the Professor
so and he said I was an ass which didnt affect the statement in
the least I have seen museums like Chautauqua before and well I
know what they mean If you do not understand read the first part of
Aurora Leigh Lectures on the Chautauqua stamp I have heard before
People dont get educated that way They must dig for it and cry for
it and sit up o nights for it and when they have got it they must
call it by another name or their struggle is of no avail You can get
a degree from this Lawn Tennis Tabernacle of all the arts and sciences
at Chautauqua Mercifully the students are womenfolk and if they
marry the degree is forgotten and if they become schoolteachers they
can only instruct young America in the art of mispronouncing his own
language And yet so great is the perversity of the American girl that
she can scorning tennis and the allurements of boating work herself
nearly to death over the skittles of archology and foreign tongues to
the sorrow of all her friends

Late that evening the contemptuous courtesy of the hotel allotted me
a room in a cottage of quarterinch planking destitute of the most
essential articles of toilette furniture Ten shillings a day was the
price of this shelter for Chautauqua is a paying institution I heard
the Professor next door banging about like a big jackrabbit in a very
small packingcase Presently he entered holding between disgusted
finger and thumb the butt end of a candle his only light and this in
a house that would burn quicker than cardboard if once lighted

Isnt it shameful Isnt it atrocious A dk bungalow khansamah
wouldnt dare to give me a raw candle to go to bed by I say when you
describe this hole rend them to pieces A candle stump Give it em
hot

You will remember the Professors advice to me not long ago Fessor
said I loftily my own room was a windowless dogkennel this
is unseemly We are now in the most civilised country on earth
enjoying the advantages of an Institootion which is the flower of the
civilisation of the nineteenth century and yet you kick up a fuss over
being obliged to go to bed by the stump of a candle Think of the Pope
in the Middle Ages Reflect on the art side of Greek life Remember
the Sabbath day to keep it holy and get out of this Youre filling
twothirds of my room

                                   

Apropos of Sabbath I have come across some lovely reading which
it grieves me that I have not preserved Chautauqua you must know
shuts down on Sundays With awful severity an eminent clergyman has
been writing to the papers about the beauties of the system The
stalls that dispense terrible drinks of Moxie typhoidal milkshakes
and sulphuricacidonlimebred sodawater are stopped boating is
forbidden no steamer calls at the jetty and the nearest railway
station is three miles off and you cant hire a conveyance the
barbers must not shave you and no milkman or butcher goes his rounds
The reverend gentleman enjoys this he must wear a beard I forget
his exact words but they run And thus thank God no one can supply
himself on the Lords day with the luxuries or conveniences that he has
neglected to procure on Saturday Of course if you happen to linger
inside the wicket gateverily Chautauqua is a close preserveover
Sunday you must bow gracefully to the rules of the place But what are
you to do with this frame of mind The owner of it would send missions
to convert the heathen or would convert you at ten minutes notice
and yet if you called him a heathen and an idolater he would probably
be very much offended

Oh my friends I have been to one source of the river of missionary
enterprise and the waters thereof are bitterbitter as hate narrow
as the grave Not now do I wonder that the missionary in the East is at
times to our thinking a little intolerant towards beliefs he cannot
understand and people he does not appreciate Rather it is a mystery
to me that these delegates of an imperious ecclesiasticism have not
a hundred times ere this provoked murder and fire among our wards
If they were true to the iron teachings of Centreville or Petumna or
Chunkhaven when they came they would have done so For Centreville or
Smithson or Squeehawken teach the only true creeds in all the world
and to err from their tenets as laid down by the bishops and the
elders is damnation How it may be in England at the centres of supply
I cannot tell but shall presently learn Here in America I am afraid
of these grim men of the denominations who know so intimately the will
of the Lord and enforce it to the uttermost Left to themselves they
would prayerfully in all good faith and sincerity slide gradually
ere a hundred years from the mental inquisitions which they now
work with some success to an institootionbe sure it would be an
institootion with a journal of its ownnot far different from what
the Torquemada ruled aforetime Does this seem extravagant I have
watched the expression on the mens faces when they told me that they
would rather see their son or daughter dead at their feet than doing
such and such thingstrampling on the grass on a Sunday or something
equally heinousand I was grateful that the law of men stood between
me and their interpretation of the law of God They would assuredly
slay the body for the souls sake and account it righteousness And
this would befall not in the next generation perhaps but in the next
for the very look I saw in a Eusufzais face at Peshawar when he turned
and spat in my tracks I have seen this day at Chautauqua in the face of
a preacher The will was there but not the power

The Professor went up the lake on a visit taking my ticket of
admission with him and I found a child aged seven fishing with a
worm and pin and spent the rest of the afternoon in his company He
was a delightful young citizen full of information and apparently
ignorant of denominations We caught sun fish and catfish and pickerel
together

The trouble began when I attempted to escape through the wicket on the
jetty and let the creeds fight it out among themselves Without that
ticket I could not go unless I paid five dollars That was the rule to
prevent people cheating

You see quoth a man in charge youve no idea of the meanness of
these people Why there was a lady this seasona prominent member of
the Baptist connectionwe know but we cant prove it that she had two
of her hired girls in a cellar when the grounds were being canvassed
for the annual polltax of five dollars a head So she saved ten
dollars We cant be too careful with this crowd Youve got to produce
that ticket as a proof that you havent been living in the grounds for
weeks and weeks

For weeks and weeks The blue went out of the sky as he said it But
I wouldnt stay here for one week if I could help it I answered

No more would I he said earnestly

Returned the Professor in a steamer and him I basely left to make
explanations about that ticket while I returned to Lakewoodthe nice
hotel without any regulations I feared that I should be kept in those
terrible grounds for the rest of my life

And it turned out an hour later that the same fear lay upon the
Professor also He arrived heated but exultant having baffled the
combined forces of all the denominations and recovered the fivedollar
deposit I wouldnt go inside those gates for anything he said I
waited on the jetty What do you think of it all

It has shown me a new side of American life I responded I never
want to see it againand Im awfully sorry for the girls who take it
seriously I suppose the bulk of them dont They just have a good
time But it would be better

How

If they all got married instead of pumping up interest in a
bricbrac museum and advertised lectures and having their names in
the papers One never gets to believe in the proper destiny of woman
until one sees a thousand of em doing something different I dont
like Chautauqua Theres something wrong with it and I havent time to
find out where But it is wrong

THE BOW FLUME CABLECAR


See those things yonder He looked in the direction of the Market
Street cablecars which moved without any visible agency were
conveying the good people of San Francisco to a picnic somewhere
across the harbour The stranger was not more than seven feet high
His face was burnished copper his hands and beard were fiery red and
his eyes a baleful blue He had thrust his large frame into a suit of
black clothes which made no pretensions toward fitting him and his
cheek was distended with plugtobacco Those cars he said more to
himself than to me run upon a concealed cable worked by machinery
and thats what broke our syndicate at Bow Flume Concealed machinery
noconcealed ropes Dont you mix yourself with them They are
ontrustworthy

These cars work comfortably I ventured They run over people now
and then but that doesnt matter

Certainly not not in Friscoby no means Its different out
yonder He waved a palmleaf fan in the direction of Mission
Dolores among the sandhills Then without a moments pause and in
a low and melancholy voice he continued Young feller all patent
machinery is a monopoly and dont you try to bust it or else it will
bust you Bout five years ago I was at Bow Flumea minintown
way back yonderbeyond the Sacramento I ran a saloon there with
OGradyHowlin OGrady so called on account of the noise he made
when intoxicated I never christened my saloon any highsoundin
name but owing to my happy trick of firing out men who was too full
of bugjuice and disposed to be promiscuous in their dealins the
boys called it The Wake Up an Git Bar OGrady my partner was an
unreasonable inventorman He invented a check on the whisky barls
that wasnt no good except lettin the whisky run off at odd times and
shutting down when a man was most thirstiest I remember half Bow Flume
city firing their sixshooters into a caskand Bourbon at thatwhich
was refusing to run on account of OGradys patent doublecheck tap
But that wasnt what I started to tell you aboutnot by a long ways
OGrady went to Frisco when the Bow Flume saloon was booming He hed
a good time in Frisco kase he came back with a very bad head and no
clothes worth talkin about He had been jailed most time but he had
investigated the mechanism of these cars yonderwhen he wasnt in the
cage He came back with the liquor for the saloon and the boys whooped
round him for half a day singing songs of glory Boys says OGrady
when a half of Bow Flume were lying on the floor kissing the cuspidors
and singing Way Down the Swanee River being full of some new stuff
OGrady had got up from Friscoboys says OGrady I have the
makings of a company in me You know the road from this saloon to Bow
Flume is bad and most perpendicular That was the exact state of
the case Bow Flume city was three hundred feet above our saloon The
boys used to roll down and get full and any that happened to be sober
rolled them up again when the time came to get Some dropped into the
caon that waybad payers mostly You see a man held all the hill
Bow Flume was built on and he wanted forty thousand dollars for a
fortyfive by hundred lot o ground We kept the whisky and the boys
came down for it The exercise disposed them to thirst Boys says
OGrady as you know I have visited the great metropolis of Frisco
Then they had drinks all round for Frisco And I have been jailed a
few while enjoying the sights Then they had drinks all round for the
jail that held OGrady But he says I have a proposal to make
More drinks on account of the proposal I have got a hold of the idea
of those Frisco cablecars Some of the idea I got in Frisco The
rest I have invented says OGrady Then they drank all round for the
invention

I am coming to the point OGrady made a companythe drunkest I ever
sawto run a cablecar on the Frisco model from Wake Up an Git
Saloon to Bow Flume The boys put in about four thousand dollars
for Bow Flume was squirling gold then Theres nary shanty there now
OGrady put in four thousand dollars of his own and I was roped in for
as much OGrady desired the concern to represent the resources of Bow
Flume We got a car built in Frisco for two thousand dollars with an
elegant bar at one endnickelplated fixings and ruby glass

The notion was to dispense liquor en route A Bow Flume man could
put himself outside two drinks in a minute and a half the same not
being pressed for urgent business The boys graded the road for love
and we run a rope in a little trough in the middle That rope ran
swift and any blame fool that had his foot cut off fooling in the
middle of the road might ha found salvation by using our Bow Flume
Palace Car The boys said that was square OGrady took the contract
for building the engine to wind the rope He called his show a muleit
was a crossbreed between a threshing machine and an elevator ram
I dont think he had followed the Frisco patterns He put all our
dollars into that blamed barroom on the car knowing what would please
the boys best They didnt care much about the machinery so long as
the car hummed

We charged the boys a dollar a head per trip One free drink included
That paidpaid likeParadise They liked the motion OGrady was
engineer and another man sort of tended to the rope engine when he
wasnt otherwise engaged Those cablecars run by gripping on to the
rope You know that When the grips off the car is braked down and
stands still There ought to have been two cars by rightone to run up
and the other down But OGrady had a blamed invention for reversing
the engine so the cable ran both waysup to Bow Flume and down to
the saloonthe terminus being in front of our door A man could kick
a friend slick from the bar into the car The boys appreciated that
The Bow Flume Palace Car Company earned twenty on the hundred in three
months besides the profits of the drinks We might have lasted to this
day if OGrady hadnt tinkered his blamed engine up on top of Bow Flume
Hill The boys complained the show didnt hum sufficient They required
railroad speed OGrady ran em up and down at fourteen miles an hour
and his latest improvement was to touch twentyfour The strain on the
brakes was terriblequite terrible But every time OGrady raised the
record the boys gave him a testimonial Twasnt in human nature not
to crowd ahead after that Testimonials demoralise the publickest of
men

I rode on the car that memorial day Just as we started with a double
load of boys and a razzledazzle assortment of drinks something
went zip under the car bottom We proceeded with velocity All the
prominent members of the company were aboard The grip has got
snubbed on the rope says OGrady quite quietly Boys this will
be the biggest smash on record Somethings going to happen We
proceeded at the rate of twentyfour miles an hour till the end of
our journey I dont know what happened there We could get clear of
the rope anyways at the point where it turned round a pulley to start
up hill again We struckstruck the stoop of the Wake Up an Git
Saloonmy saloonand the next thing I knew was feeling of my legs
under an assortment of matchwood and broken glass representing liquor
and fixtures to the tune of eight thousand The car had been flicked
through the saloon bringing down the entire roof on the floor It
had then bucked out into the firmament describing a parabola over
the bluff at the back of the saloon and was lying at the foot of
that bluff three hundred feet below like a busted kaleidoscopeall
nickel shavings and bits of red glass OGrady and most of the
prominent members of the company were deadvery deadand there wasnt
enough left of the saloon to pay for a drink I took in the situation
lying on my stomach at the edge of the bluff and I suspicioned that
any lawsuits that might arise would be complicated by shooting So I
quit Bow Flume by the back trail I guess the coroner judged that there
were no summonsleastways I never heard any more about it Since that
time Ive had a distrust to cablecars The rope breaking is no great
odds bekase you can stop the car but its getting the grip tangled
with the running rope that spreads ruin and desolation over thriving
communities and prevents the development of local resources

IN PARTIBUS


  The buses run to Battersea
        The buses run to Bow
      The buses run to Westbourne Grove
        And Nottinghill also
  But I am sick of London town
    From Shepherds Bush to Bow

  I see the smut upon my cuff
    And feel him on my nose
  I cannot leave my window wide
    When gentle zephyr blows
  Because he brings disgusting things
    And drops em on my cloes

  The sky a greasy souptoureen
    Shuts down atop my brow
  Yes I have sighed for London town
    And I have got it now
  And half of it is fog and filth
    And half is fog and row

  And when I take my nightly prowl
    Tis passing good to meet
  The pious Briton lugging home
    His wife and daughter sweet
  Through four packed miles of seething vice
    Thrust out upon the street

  Earth holds no horror like to this
    In any land displayed
  From Suez unto Sandy Hook
    From Calais to Port Said
  And twas to hide their heathendom
    The beastly fog was made

  I cannot tell when dawn is near
    Or when the day is done
  Because I always see the gas
    And never see the sun
  And now methinks I do not care
    A cuss for either one

  But stay there was an orange or
    An aged egg its yolk
  It might have been a Pears balloon
    Or Barnums latest joke
  I took it for the sun and wept
    To watch it through the smoke

  Its Oh to see the morn ablaze
    Above the mangotope
  When homeward through the dewy cane
    The little jackals lope
  And half Bengal heaves into view
    Newwashedwith sunlight soap

  Its Oh for one deep whisky peg
    When Christmas winds are blowing
  When all the men you ever knew
    And all youve ceased from knowing
  Are entered for the Tournament
    And everything thats going

  But I consort with longhaired things
    In velvet collarrolls
  Who talk about the Aims of Art
    And theories and goals
  And moo and coo with womenfolk
    About their blessed souls

  But that they call psychology
    Is lack of liver pill
  And all that blights their tender souls
    Is eating till theyre ill
  And their chief way of winning goals
    Consists in sitting still

  Its Oh to meet an Army man
    Set up and trimmed and taut
  Who does not spout hashed libraries
    Or think the next mans thought
  And walks as though he owned himself
    And hogs his bristles short

  Hear now a voice across the seas
    To kin beyond my ken
  If ye have ever filled an hour
    With stories from my pen
  For pitys sake send some one here
    To bring me news of men

  The buses run to Islington
    To Highgate and Soho
  To Hammersmith and Kew therewith
    And Camberwell also

I


 To Lieutenant John McHail
 st Kumharsen PNI
   Hakaiti via Tharanda
     Assam


Dear Old Man Your handwriting is worse than ever but as far as I can
see among the loops and fishhooks you are lonesome and want to be
comforted with a letter I knew you wouldnt write to me unless you
needed something You dont tell me that you have left your regiment
but from what you say about my battalion my men and so forth it
seems as if you were raising military police for the benefit of the
Chins If thats the case I congratulate you The pay is good Ouless
writes to me from some new fort something or other saying that he
has struggled into a billet of Rs  Military Police and instead
of being chased by writters as he used to be is ravaging the country
round Shillong in search of a wife I am very sorry for the Mrs Ouless
of the future

That doesnt matter You probably know more about the boys yonder than
I do If youll only send me from time to time some record of their
movements Ill try to tell you of things on this side of the water You
say You dont know what it is to hear from town I say You dont
know what it is to hear from the dehat Now and again men drift
in with news but I dont like hotweather khubber Its all of
the domestic occurrence kind Old Hat Constable came to see me the
other day You remember the click in his throat before he begins to
speak He sat still clicking at quarterhour intervals and after each
click hed say Dye remember Mistress SoanSo Well shes dead o
typhoid at Naogong When it wasnt Mistress SoanSo it was a man
I stood four clicks and four deaths and then I asked him to spare me
the rest You seem to have had a bad season taking it all round and
the women seem to have suffered most Is that so

We dont die in London We go out of town and we make as much fuss
about it as if we were going to the Neva Now I understand why the
transport is the first thing to break down when our army takes the
field The Englishman is cumbrous in his movements and very particular
about his baskets and hampers and trunksnot less than seven of
eachfor a fiftymile journey Leave season began some weeks ago and
there is a burrachoop along the streets that you could shovel with
a spade All the people that say they are everybody have gonequite
two hundred miles away Some of em are even on the Continentand the
clubs are full of strange folk I found a Reform man at the Savage a
week ago He didnt say what his business was but he was dusty and
looked hungry I suppose he had come in for food and shelter

Like the rest Im on leave too I converted myself into a Government
Secretary awarded myself one month on full pay with the chance of an
extension and went off Then it rained and hailed and rained again
and I ran up and down this tiny country in trains trying to find a dry
place After ten days I came back to town having been stopped by the
sea four times I was rather like a kitten at the bottom of a bucke
chasing its own tail So Im sitting here under a grey muggy sky
wondering what sort of time they are having at Simla Its August now
The rains would be nearly over all the theatricals would be in full
swing and Jakko Hill would be just Paradise Youre probably pink with
prickly heat Sit down quietly under the punkah and think of Umballa
station hot as an oven at four in the morning Think of the dakgharry
slobbering in the wet and the first little cold wind that comes round
the first corner after the tonga is clear of Kalka Theres a wind
you and I know well Its blowing over the grass at Dugshai this
very moment and theres a smell of hot fir trees all along and along
from Solon to Simla and some happy man is flying up that road with
fragments of a tongabar in his eye his pet terrier under his arm his
thick clothes on the backseat and the certainty of a months pure joy
in front of him Instead of which youre being stewed at Hakaiti and
Im sitting in a secondhand atmosphere above a sausageshop watching
three sparrows playing in a dirtygreen tree and pretending that its
summer I have a view of very many streets and a river Except the
advertisements on the walls there isnt one speck of colour as far
as my eye can reach The very cat who is an amiable beast comes
off black under my hand and I darent open the window for fear of
smuts And this is better than a soaked and sobbled country with the
cornshocks standing like plovers eggs in green moss and the oats
lying flat in moist lumps We havent had any summer and yesterday I
smelt the raw touch of the winter Just one little whiff to show that
the year had turned Oh what a happy land is England

I cannot understand the white man at home You remember when we went
out together and landed at the Apollo Bunder with all our sorrows
before us and went to Watsons Hotel and saw the snakecharmers You
said Itll take me all my lifetime to distinguish one nigger from
another That was eight years ago Now you dont call them niggers
any more and youre supposedquite wronglyto have an insight into
native character or else you would never have been allowed to recruit
for the Kumharsens I feel as I felt at Watsons They are so deathlily
alike especially the more educated They all seem to read the same
books and the same newspapers telling em what to admire in the same
books and they all quote the same passages from the same books and
they write books on books about somebody elses books and they are
penetrated to their bootheels with a sense of the awful seriousness
of their own views of the moment Above that they seem to be most
curiously and beyond the right of ordinary people divorced from the
knowledge or fear of death Of course every man conceives that every
man except himself is bound to die you remember how Hallatt spoke the
night before he went out but these men appear to be like children in
that respect

I cant explain exactly but it gives an air of unreality to their
most earnest earnestnesses and when a young man of views and culture
and aspirations is in earnest the trumpets of Jericho are silent
beside him Because they have everything done for them they know how
everything ought to be done and they are perfectly certain that wood
pavements policemen shops and gaslight come in the regular course
of nature You can guess with these convictions how thoroughly and
cocksurely they handle little trifles like colonial administration the
wants of the army municipal sewage housing of the poor and so forth
Every third common need of average men is in their mouths a tendency
or a movement or a federation affecting the world It never seems to
occur to em that the human instinct of getting as much as possible for
money paid or failing money for threats and fawnings is about as
old as Cain and the burden of their bat is Me an a few mates o
mine are going to make a new world

As long as men only write and talk they must think that way I suppose
Its compensation for playing with little things And that reminds me
Do you know the University smile You dont by that name but sometimes
young civilians wear it for a very short time when they first come
out SomethingI wonder if its our brutal chaff or a billiardcue
or whichtakes it out of their faces and when they next differ with
you they do so without smiling But that smile flourishes in London
Ive met it again and again It expresses tempered grief sorrow at
your complete inability to march with the march of progress at the
Universities and a chastened contempt There is one man who wears it
as a garment He is frivolously youngnot more than thirtyfive or
fortyand all these years no one has removed that smile He knows
everything about everything on this earth and above all he knows all
about men under any and every condition of life He knows all about
the aggressive militarism of you and your friends he isnt quite sure
of the necessity of an army he is certain that colonial expansion
is nonsense and he is more than certain that the whole step of all
our Empire must be regulated by the knowledge and foresight of the
workingman Then he smilessmiles like a seraph with an MA degree
What can you do with a man like that He has never seen an unmade road
in his life I think he believes that wheat grows on a tree and that
beef is dug from a mine He has never been forty miles from a railway
and he has never been called upon to issue an order to anybody except
his wellfed servants Isnt it wondrous And there are battalions
and brigades of these men in town removed from the fear of want
living until they are seventy or eighty sheltered fed drained and
administered expending their vast leisure in talking and writing

But the real fun begins much lower down the line Ive been associating
generally and very particularly with the men who say that they are
the only men in the world who workand they call themselves the
workingman Now the workingman in America is a nice person He says he
is a man and behaves accordingly That is to say he has some notion
that he is part and parcel of a great country At least he talks that
way But in this town you can see thousands of men meeting publicly
on Sundays to cry aloud that everybody may hear that they are poor
downtrodden helotsin fact the pore workinman At their clubs and
pubs the talk is the same Its the utter want of selfrespect that
revolts My friend the tobacconist has a cousin who is apparently
sound in mind and limb aged twentythree cleareyed and upstanding
He is a skibbo by tradea painter of sorts He married at twenty
and he has two children He can spend threequarters of an hour talking
about his downtrodden condition He works under another Rajmistri
who has saved money and started a little shop of his own He hates that
Rajmistri he loathes the police and his views on the lives and
customs of the aristocracy are strange He approves of every form of
lawlessness and he knows that everybody who holds authority is sure
to be making a good thing out of it Of himself as a citizen he never
thinks Of himself as an Ishmael he thinks a good deal He is entitled
to eight hours work a day and some time offsaid time to be paid for
he is entitled to free education for his childrenand he doesnt want
no bloomin clergyman to teach em he is entitled to houses especially
built for himself because he pays the bulk of the taxes of the country
He is not going to emigrate not he he reserves to himself the right
of multiplying as much as he pleases the streets must be policed for
him while he demonstrates immediately under my window by the way for
ten consecutive hours and I am probably a thief because my clothes
are better than his The proposition is a very simple one He has no
duties to the State no personal responsibility of any kind and hed
sooner see his children dead than soldiers of the Queen The Government
owes him everything because he is a pore workinman When the Guards
tried their Boardschool mutiny at the Wellington Barracks my friend
was jubilant What did I tell you he said You see the very
soldiers wont stand it

Whats it

Bein treated like machines instead of flesh and blood Course they
wont

The popular evening paper wrote that the Guards with perfect justice
had rebelled against being treated like machines instead of flesh and
blood Then I thought of a certain regiment that lay in Mian Mir for
three years and dropped four hundred men out of a thousand It died of
fever and cholera There were no pretty nursemaids to work with it in
the streets because there were no streets I saw how the Guards amused
themselves and how their sergeants smoked in uniform I pitied the
Guards with their cruel sentrygoes their three nights out of bed
and their unlimited supply of love and liquor

Another man not a workman told me that the Guards riotits
impossible as you know to call this kickup of the fatted flunkies
of the army a mutinywas only a schoolboys prank and he could not
see that if it was what he said it was the Guards were no regiment
and should have been wiped out decently and quietly There again the
futility of a sheltered people cropped up You mustnt treat a man like
a machine in this country but you cant get any work out of a man till
he has learned to work like a machine D has just come home for a
few months from the charge of a mountain battery on the frontier He
used to begin work at eight and he was thankful if he got off at six
most of the time on his feet When he went to the Black Mountain he was
extensively engaged for nearly sixteen hours a day and that on food
at which the pore workinman would have turned up his statelifted
nose D on the subject of labour as understood by the white man in
his own home is worth hearing Though coarseconsiderably coarse But
D doesnt know all the hopeless misery of the business When the
small pig oyster furniture carpet builder or general shopman works
his way out of the ruck he turns round and makes his old friends and
employes sweat He knows how near he can go to flaying em alive before
they kick and in this matter he is neither better nor worse than a
bunnia or a havildar of our own blessed country Its the small
employer of labour that skins his servant exactly as the fortypound
householder works her one white servant to the bone and goes to drop
pennies into the plate to convert the heathen in the East

Just at present as you have read the person who calls himself the
pore workinmanthe man I saw kicking fallen men in the mud by the
docks last winterhas discovered a real fine new original notion
and he is working it for all he is worth He calls it the solidarity
of labour bundobast but its castefour thousand years old caste
of Menuwith old shetts mahajuns guildtolls excommunication
and all the rest of it All things considered there isnt anything
much older than casteit began with the second generation of man on
earthbut to read the advance papers on the subject youd imagine it
was a revelation from Heaven The real fun will beginas it has begun
and ended many times beforewhen the caste of skilled labourthats
the pore workinmanare pushed up and knocked about by the lower and
unrecognised castes who will form castes of their own and outcaste on
the decision of their own punchayats How these castes will scuffle
and fight among themselves and how astonished the Englishman will be

He is naturally lawless because he is a fighting animal and his
amazingly sheltered condition has made him inconsequent I dont like
inconsequent lawlessness Ive seen it down at Bow Street at the
docks by the GPO and elsewhere Its chief home of course is in
that queer place called the House of Commons but no one goes there who
isnt forced by business Its shut up at present and the persons
who belong to it are loose all over the face of the country I dont
thinkbut I wont swearthat any of them are spitting at policemen
One man appears to have been poaching others are advocating various
forms of murder and outrageand nobody seems to care The residue
talkjust heavens how they talk and what wonderful fictions they
tell And they firmly believe being ignorant of the mechanism of
Government that they administer the country In addition certain of
their newspapers have elaborately worked up a famine in Ireland that
could be engineered by two Deputy Commissioners and four average Stunts
into a woe and a calamity that is going to overshadow the peace of
the nationeven the Empire I suppose they have their own sense of
proportion but they manage to keep it to themselves very successfully
What do you who have seen half a countryside in deadly fear of its
life suppose that this people would do if they were chukkered and
gabraowed If they really knew what the fear of death and the dread
of injury implied If they died very swiftly indeed and could not
count their futile lives enduring beyond next sundown Some of the men
from yourI mean ourpart of the world say that they would be afraid
and break and scatter and run But there is no room in the island to
run The sea catches you midwaist at the third step I am curious to
see if the cholera of which these people stand in most lively dread
gets a firm foothold in London In that case I have a notion that
there will be scenes and panics They live too well here and have too
much to make life worth clinging toclubs and shop fronts and gas
and theatres and so forththings that they affect to despise and
whereon and whereby they live like leeches But I have written enough
It doesnt exhaust the subject but you wont be grateful for other
epistles De Vitre of the Poona Irregular Moguls will have it that
they are a tiddyiddy people He says that all their visible use is
to produce loans for the colonies and men to be used up in developing
India I honestly believe that the average Englishman would faint
if you told him it was lawful to use up human life for any purpose
whatever He believes that it has to be developed and made beautiful
for the possessor and in that belief talkatively perpetrates cruelties
that would make Torquemada jump in his grave Go to Alipur if you want
to see I am off to foreign partsforty miles awayto catch fish for
my friend the charcat also to shoot a little bird if I have luck

 Yours

 To Captain J McHail
   st Kumharsen NI
     Hakaiti via Tharanda

Captain Sahib Bahadur The last Pi gives me news of your step and
Im more pleased about it than many Youve been cavalry quick in
your promotion Eight years and your company Allahu But it must have
been that long lean horsehead of yours that looks so wise and says so
little that has imposed upon the authorities My best congratulations
Let out your belt two holes and be happy as I am not

Did I tell you in my last about going to Woking in search of a grave
The dust and the grime and the grey and the sausageshop told on
my spirits to such an extent that I solemnly took a train and went
gravehunting through the Necropolislocally called the Necrapolis
I wanted an eligible entirely detached site in a commanding
positionsix by three and bricked throughout I found it but the only
drawback was that I must go back to town to the head office to buy it
One doesnt go to town to haggle for tombspace so I deferred the
matter and went fishing All the same there are very nice graves at
Woking and I shall keep my eye on one of em

Since that date I seem to have been in four or five places because
there are labels on the bag One of the places was Plymouth where
I found half a regiment at field exercises on the Hoe They were
practising the attack in three lines with the mixed rush at the end
even as it is laid down in the drillbook and they charged subduedly
across the Hoe The people laughed I was much more inclined to cry
Except the Major there didnt seem to be anything more than twenty
years old in the regiment and oh but it was pink and white and chubby
and undersizedjust made to die succulently of disease I fancied
that some of our battalions out with you were more or less young and
exposed but a home battalion is a crche and it scares one to
watch it Eminent and distinguished Generals get up after dinnerIve
listened to two of emand explain that though the home battalion can
only be regarded as a feeder to the foreign yet all our battalions can
be regarded as efficient and if they arent efficient we shall find
in our military reserve the nucleushow I loath that lying wordof
the Lord knows what but the speeches always end with allusions to the
spirit of the English their glorious past and the certainty that when
the hour of need comes the nation will emerge victorious If sic
the Engineer of the Hungerford Bridge told the Southeastern Railway
that because a main girder had stood for thirty years without need of
renewal it was therefore sure to stand for another fifty he would
probably get the sack Our military authorities dont get the sack
They are allowed to make speeches in public Some day if we live long
enough we shall see the glories of the past and the sublime instinct
of an ancient people without one complete army corps pitted against
a few unsentimental longrange guns and some efficiently organised
troops Then the band will begin to play and it will not play Rule
Britannia until it has played some funny tunes first

Do you remember Tighe He was in the Deccan Lancers and retired because
he got married He is in Ireland now and I met him the other day
idle unhappy and dying for some work to do Mrs Tighe is equally
miserable She wants to go back to Poona instead of administering a
big barrack of a house somewhere at the back of a bog I quote Tighe
here He has you may remember a pretty tongue about him and he was
describing to me at length how a home regiment behaves when it is
solemnly turned out for a week or a month training under canvas

About four in the mornin me dear boy they begin pitchin their
tents for the next dayfour hours to pitch it and the tent ropes a
howlin tangle when alls said and sworn Then they tie their horses
with strings to their big toes and go to bed in hollows and caves in
the earth till the rain falls and the tents are flooded and then me
dear boy the men and the horses and the ropes and the vegetation of
the country cuddle each other till the morning for the companys sake
And next day it all begins again Just when they are beginning to
understand how to camp they are all put back into their boxes and half
of em have lung disease

But what is the use of snarling and grumbling The matter will adjust
itself later on and the one nation on earth that talks and thinks most
of the sanctity of human life will be a little astonished at the waste
of life for which it will be responsible In those days my captain
the man who can command seasoned troops and have made the best use of
those troops will be sought after and petted and will rise to honour
Remember the Hakaiti when next you measure the naked recruit

Let us revisit calmer scenes Ive been down for three perfect days
to the seaside Dont you remember what a really fine day means A
milkwhite sea as smooth as glass with bluewhite heat haze hanging
over it one little wave talking to itself on the sand warm shingle
four bathing machines cliff in the background and half the babies
in Christendom paddling and yelling It was a queer little place
just near enough to the main line of traffic to be overlooked from
morning till night There was a babyan Ollendorfian babywith whom
I fell madly in love She lived down at the bottom of a great white
sunbonnet talked French and English in a clear belllike voice and
of such I fervently hope will the Kingdom of Heaven be When she found
that my French wasnt equal to hers she condescendingly talked English
and bade me build her houses of stones and draw cats for her through
half the day After I had done everything that she ordered she went
off to talk to some one else The beach belonged to that baby and
every soul on it was her servant for I know that we rose with shouts
when she paddled into three inches of water and sat down gasping
Mon Dieu Je suis mort I know you like the little ones so I
dont apologise for yarning about them She had a sister aged seven
and onehalfa lovely child without a scrap of selfconsciousness
and enormous eyes Here comes a real tragedy The girland her name
was Violethad fallen wildly in love with a little fellow of nine
They used to walk up the single street of the village with their arms
round each others necks Naturally she did all the little wooings
and Hugh submitted quietly Then devotion began to pall and he didnt
care to paddle with Violet Hereupon as far as I can gather she
smote him on the head and threw him against a wall Anyhow it was
very sweet and natural and Hugh told me about it when I came down
Shes so unrulable he said I didnt hit her back but I was very
angry Of course Violet repented but Hugh grew suspicious and at
the psychological moment there came down from town a destroyer of
delights and a separator of companions in the shape of a tricycle
Also there were many little boys on the beachrude shouting romping
little chapswho said Come along Hullo and used the wicked word
beastly Among these Hugh became a person of importance and began to
realise that he was a man who could say beastly and Come on with
the best of em He preferred to run about with the little boys on wars
and expeditions and he wriggled away when Violet put her arm round
his waist Violet was hurt and angry and I think she slapped Hugh
Relations were strained when I arrived because one morning Violet
after asking permission invited Hugh to come to lunch And that bad
Spanisheyed boy deliberately filled his bucket with the cold seawater
and dashed it over Violets pink ankles Joking apart this seems to
be about the best way of refusing an invitation that civilisation can
invent Try it on your Colonel She was madly angry for a moment and
then she said Let me carry you up the beach cause of the shingles
in your toes This was divine but it didnt move Hugh and Violet
went off to her mother She sat down with her chin in her hand looking
out at the sea for a long time very sorrowfully Then she said and
it was her first experience I know that Hugh cares more for his
horrid bicycle than he does for me and if he said he didnt I wouldnt
believe him

Up to date Hugh has said nothing He is running about playing with the
bold bad little boys and Violet is sitting on a breakwater trying
to find out why things are as they are Its a nice tale and tales
are scarce these days Have you noticed how small and elemental is the
stock of them at the worlds disposal Men foregathered at that little
seaside place and manlike exchanged stories They were all the same
stories One had heard em in the East with Eastern variations and in
the West with Western extravagances tacked on Only one thing seemed
new and it was merely a phrase used by a groom in speaking of an
illconditioned horse No sir hes not ill in a manner o speaking
but hes so to speak generally unfriendly with his innards as a usual
thing

I entrust this to you as a sacred gift See that it takes root in the
land Unfriendly with his innards as a usual thing Remember Its
better than laboured explanations in the rains And I fancy its raw

And now But I had nearly forgotten Were a nation of grumblers and
thats why other people call AngloIndians bores I write feelingly
because M just home on long leave has for the second time sat on
my devoted head for two hours simply and solely for the purpose of
swearing at the AccountantGeneral He has given me the whole history
of his pay prospects and promotion twice over and in case I should
misunderstand wants me to dine with him and hear it all for the third
time If M would leave the AG alone he is a delightful man
as we all know but hes loose in London now buttonholing English
friends and quoting leave and paycodes to them He wants to see
a Member of Parliament about something or other and I believe he
spends his nights rolled up in a rezai on the stairs of the India
Office waiting to catch a secretary I like the India Office They
are so beautifully casual and lazy and their rooms look out over the
Green Park and they are never tired of admiring the view Now and
then a man comes in to report himself and the secretaries and the
undersecretaries and the chaprassies play battledore and shuttlecock
with him until they are tired

Some time since when I was better more serious and earnest than I
am now I preached a jehad up and down those echoing corridors
and suggested the abolition of the India Office and the purchase of a
fourpoundten American revolving bookcase to hold all the documents on
India that were of public value or could be comprehended by the public
Now I am more frivolous because I am dropping gently into that grave at
Woking and yet I believe in the bookcase India is bowed down with too
much duftar as it is and the House of Correction Revision Division
and Supervision cannot do her much good I saw a committee or a council
file in the other day Only one desirable tale came to me out of that
office If youve heard it before stop me It began with a cutting
from an obscure Welsh paper I think A mana gardenerwent mad
announced that Lord Cross was the Messiah and burned himself alive on a
pile of garden refuse Thats the first part I never could get at the
second but I am credibly informed that the work of the India Office
stood still for three weeks while the entire staff took council how to
break the news to the Secretary of State I believe it still remains
unbroken

                                   

Decidedly leave in England is a disappointing thing Ive wandered
into two stations since I wrote the last Nothing but the labels on the
bag remainoh and a memory of a weighingin at an East End fishing
club That was an experience I foregathered with a man on the top
of a bus and we became great friends because we both agreed that
gorgetackle for pike was only permissible in very weedy streams He
repeated his views which were my views nearly ten times and in
the evening invited me to this weighingin at well say rooms of
the Lea and Chertsey Piscatorial Anglers Benevolent Brotherhood We
assembled in a room at the top of a publichouse the walls ornamented
with stuffed fish and waterbirds and the anglers came in by twos and
threes and I was introduced to all of em as the genelman I met just
now This seemed to be good enough for all practical purposes There
were ten and five shilling prizes and the affable and energetic clerk
of the scales behaved as though he were weighingin for the Lucknow
races The take of the day was one pound fifteen ounces of dace and
roach about twenty fingerlings and the winner who is in charge of a
railway bookstall described minutely how he had caught each fish As
a matter of fact roachfishing in the Lea and Thames is a fine art
Then there were drinksmodest little drinksand they called upon me
for a sentiment You know how things go at the sergeants messes and
some of the lodges In a moment of brilliant inspiration I gave free
fishing in the parks and brought down the whole house Sah free
fishing for coarse fish in the Serpentine and the Green Park water
would hurt nobody and do a great deal of good to many The stocking
of the waterbut what does this interest you The Englishman moves
slowly He is just beginning to understand that it is not sufficient
to set apart a certain amount of land for a lung of London and to turn
people into it with There get along and play unless he gives em
something to play with Thirty years hence he will almost allow cafs
and hired bands in Hyde Park

To return for a moment to the fish club I got away at eleven and in
darkness and despair had to make my way west for leagues and leagues
across London I was on the Mile End Road at midnight and there lost
myself and learned something more about the policeman He is haughty
in the East and always afraid that he is being chaffed I honestly
only wanted sailing directions to get homeward One policeman said
Get along You know your way as well as I do And yet another You
go back to the country where you comed from You aint doin no good
ere It was so deadly true that I couldnt answer back and there
wasnt an expensive cab handy to prove my virtue and respectability
Next time I visit the Lea and Chertsey Affabilities Ill find out
something about trains Meantime I keep holiday dolefully There is not
anybody to play with me They have all gone away to their own places
Even the Infant who is generally the idlest man in the world writes
me that he is helping to steer a tenton yacht in Scottish seas When
she heels over too much the Infant is driven to the OP side and she
rights herself The Infants host says Isnt this bracing Isnt this
delightful And the Infant who lives in dread of a chill bringing
back his Indian fever has to say Yees and pretend to despise
overcoats

Wallah This is a cheerful world

THE ADORATION OF THE MAGE


This is a slim thin little story but it serves to explain a great
many things I picked it up in a fourwheeler in the company of an
eminent novelist a pinkeyed young gentleman who lived on his income
and a gentleman who knew more than he ought and I preserved it
thinking it would serve to interest you It may be an old story but
the GWKTHO whom for the sake of brevity we will call Captain
Kydd declared that his best friend had heard it himself Consequently
I doubted its newness more than ever For when a man raises his voice
and vows that the incident occurred opposite his own Club window all
the listening world know that they are about to hear what is vulgarly
called a cracker This rule holds good in London as well as in Lahore
When we left the house of the highly distinguished politician who had
been entertaining us we stepped into a London Particular which has
nothing whatever to do with the story but was interesting from the
little fact that we could not see our hands before our faces The
black brutal fog had turned each gasjet into a pinprick of light
visible only at six inches range There were no houses there were no
pavements There were no points of the compass There were only the
eminent novelist the young gentleman with the pink eyes Captain Kydd
and myself holding each others shoulders in the gloom of Tophet Then
the eminent novelist delivered himself of an epigram

Lets go home said he

Let us try said Captain Kydd and incontinently fell down an area
into somebodys kitchen yard and disappeared into chaos When he
had climbed out again we heard a something on wheels swearing even
worse than Captain Kydd was all among the railings of a square So
we shouted and presently a fourwheeler drove gracefully on to the
pavement

Im trying to get ome said the cabby But if you gents make it
worth while  though heaven knows ow we ever shall Guess arf
a crown apiece might  and anyow I wont promise anywheres in
particular

The cabby kept his word nobly He did not find anywheres in particular
but he found several places First he discovered a pavement kerb and
drove pressing his wheel against it till we came to a lamppost
and that we hit grievously Then he came to what ought to have been
a corner but was a bus and we embraced the thing amid terrific
language Then he sailed out into nothing at allblank fogand there
he commended himself to heaven and his horse to the other place
while the eminent novelist put his head out of the window and gave
directions I begin to understand now why the eminent novelists
villains are so lifelike and his plots so obscure He has a marvellous
breadth of speech but no ingenuity in directing the course of events
We drove into the island of refuge near the Brompton Oratory just when
he was telling the cabby to be sure and avoid the Regents Park Canal

Then we began to talk about the weather and Mister Gladstone
If an Englishman is unhappy he always talks about Mister
Gladstone in terms of reproof The eminent novelist was a
socialisticNeoPlasticUnionisticDemagoglot Radical of the Extreme
Left and that is the latest novelty of the thing yet invented He
withdrew his head to answer Captain Kydds arguments which were
forcible Well youll admit hes all sorts of a madman said Captain
Kydd sweetly

Hes a saint said the eminent novelist and he moves in an
atmosphere that you and those like you cannot breathe

Yes I always said it was a pretty thick fog Now I know its as thick
as this one I say were on the pavement again we shall be in a shop
in a minute said Captain Kydd

But I wanted to see the eminent novelist fight so I reintroduced
Mister Gladstone while the cab crawled up a wall

Its not exactly a wholesome atmosphere said Captain Kydd when the
novelist had finished speaking That reminds me of a storyperfectly
true story In the old days before he went off his chump

Yahhh said the eminent novelist wrapping himself in his Inverness

went off his nut he used to consort a good deal with his friends
on his own sidevisit em y know and deliver addresses out of
their own bedroom windows and steal their postcards and generally be
friendly Well one man he stayed with had a house a country house y
know and in the garden there was a path which was supposed to divide
Kent and Surrey or some counties They led the old man forth for his
walk y know and followed him in gangs to hear that the weather was
fine and of course his host pointed out the path the old man took in
the situation and put one I daresay they had strewn roseleaves on it
or spread it with homespun trousers Anyhow one leg on one side of
the path and the other on the other and with one of those wonderful
flashes of humour that come to him when he chooses to frisk among his
friends he said Now I am in Kent and in Surrey at the same time

Captain Kydd ceased speaking as the cab tried to force a way into the
South Kensington Museum

Well whats there in that said the eminent novelist

Oh nothing much Lets see how it goes afterwards Mrs Gladstone
who was close behind him turned round and whispered to the hostess in
an ecstatic shriek Oh Mrs Whateverhernamewas you will plant a
tree there wont you

By Jove said the young gentleman with the pink eyes

I dont believe it said the eminent novelist

I said nothing but it seemed very likely Captain Kydd laughed Well
I dont consider that sort of atmosphere exactly wholesome y know

And when the cab had landed us in the drinkingfountain in High Street
Kensington and the horse fell down and the cabby collected our
halfcrowns and gave us his beery blessing and I had to grope my way
home on foot it occurred to me that perhaps you might be interested
in that anecdote As I have said it explains a great deal more than
appears at first sight

A DEATH IN THE CAMP


Two awful catastrophes have occurred One Englishman in London is dead
and I have scandalised about twenty of his nearest and dearest friends

He was a man nearly seventy years old engaged in the business of an
architect and immensely respected That was all I knew about him till
I began to circulate among his friends in these parts trying to cheer
them up and make them forget the fog

Hush said a man and his wife Dont you know he died yesterday of a
sudden attack of pneumonia Isnt it shocking

Yes said I vaguely Awfly shocking Has he left his wife provided
for

Oh hes very well off indeed and his wife is quite old But just
thinkit was only in the next street it happened Then I saw that
their grief was not for Strangeways deceased but for themselves

How old was he I said

Nearly seventy or maybe a little over

About time for a man to rationally expect such a thing as death I
thought and went away to another house where a young married couple
lived

Isnt it perfectly ghastly said the wife Mr Strangeways died last
night

So I heard said I Well he had lived his life

Yes but it was such a shockingly short illness Why only three weeks
ago he was walking about the street And she looked nervously at her
husband as though she expected him to give up the ghost at any minute

Then I gathered with the knowledge of the length of his sickness that
her grief was not for the late Mr Strangeways and went away thinking
over men and women I had known who would have given a thousand years in
Purgatory for even a week wherein to arrange their affairs and who
were anything but well off

I passed on to a third house full of children and the shadow of death
hung over their heads for father and mother were talking of Mr
Strangeways end Most shocking said they It seems that his wife
was in the next room when he was dying and his only son called her
so she just had time to take him in her arms before he died He was
unconscious at the last Wasnt it awful

When I went away from that house I thought of men and women without
a week wherein to arrange their affairs and without any money who
were anything but unconscious at the last and who would have given a
thousand years in Purgatory for one glimpse at their mothers their
wives or their husbands I reflected how these people died tended by
hirelings and strangers and I was not in the least ashamed to say
that I laughed over Mr Strangeways death as I entered the house of a
brother in his craft

Heard of Strangeways death said he Most hideous thing Why he
had only a few days before got news of his designs being accepted by
the Burgoyne Cathedral If he had lived he would have been working out
the details nowwith me And I saw that this mans fear also was not
on account of Mr Strangeways And I thought of men and women who had
died in the midst of wrecked work then I sought a company of young
men and heard them talk of the dead Thats the second death among
people I know within the year said one Yes the second death said
another

I smiled a very large smile

And you know said a third who was the oldest of the party theyve
opened the new road by the head of Tresillion Road and the wind
blows straight across that level square from the Parks Everything is
changing about us

He was an old man I said

Yees More than middleaged said they

And he outlived his reputation

Oh no or how would he have taken the designs for the Burgoyne
Cathedral Why the very day he died

Yes said I He died at the end of a completed workhis design
finished his prize awarded

Yes but he didnt live to

And his illness lasted seventeen days of twentyfour hours each

Yes

And he was tended by his own kith and kin dying with his head on his
wifes breast his hand in his only sons hand without any thought of
their possible poverty to vex him Are these things so

Yees said they Wasnt it shocking

Shocking I said Get out of this place Go forth run about and
see what death really means You have described such dying as a god
might envy and a king might pay half his ransom to make certain of
Wait till you have seen menstrong men of thirtyfive with little
children die at two days notice penniless and alone and seen it not
once but twenty times wait till you have seen the young girl die
within a fortnight of the wedding or the lover within three days of
his marriage or the mothersixty little minutesbefore her son can
come to her side wait till you hesitate before handling your daily
newspaper for fear of reading of the death of some young man that you
have dined with drank with shot with lent money to and borrowed
money from and tested to the uttermosttill you dare not hope for the
death of an old man but when you are strongest count up the tale of
your acquaintances and friends wondering how many will be alive six
months hence Wait till you have heard men calling in the death hour on
kin that cannot come till you have dined with a man one night and seen
him buried on the next Then you can begin to whimper about loneliness
and change and desolation Here I foamed at the mouth

And do you mean to say drawled a young gentleman that there is any
society in which that sort of holocaust goes on

I do said I Its not society its life And they laughed

But this is the old tale of Pharaohs chariotwheel and flyingfish

If I tell them yarns they say How true How true If I try to
present the truth they say What superb imagination

But you understand dont you

A REALLY GOOD TIME


There are times when one wants to get into pyjamas and stretch and
loll and explain things generally This is one of those times It
is impossible to stand at ease in London and the inhabitants are so
abominably egotistical that one cannot shout I I I for two minutes
without another man joining in with Me too Which things are an
allegory

The amusement began with a gentleman of infinite erudition offering to
publish my autobiography I was to write a string of legendshe would
publish them and would I forward a cheque for five guineas to cover
incidental expenses To him I explained that I wanted five guinea
cheques myself very much indeed and that emboldened by his letter
which gave me a very fair insight into his character I was even then
maturing his autobiography which I hoped to publish before long
with illustrations and would he forward a cheque for five guineas to
cover incidental expenses This brought me an eightpage compilation
of contumely He was grieved to find that he had been mistaken in my
character which he had believed was at least elevated He begged me
to remember that the first letter had been written in the strictest
confidence and that if I notated one tittle of the said repository
he would unkennel the bloodhounds of the law and hunt me down An
autobiography on the lines that I had so flippantly proposed was
libel without benefit of authorship and I had better lend him two
guineasIOU enclosedto salve his lacerated feelings I replied
that I had his autobiography by me in manuscript and would post it
to his address VPP two guineas and onehalf He evidently knew
nothing about the VPP and the correspondence stopped It is really
very hard for an AngloIndian to get along in London Besides my
autobiography is not a thing I should care to make public before
extensive Bowdlerisation

These things however only led up to much worse I dare not grin over
them unless I step aside Eastward I wrote stories all about little
pieces of India carefully arranged and expurgated for the English
public Then various people began to write about them One gentleman
pointed out that I had taken the wellworn themes of passion love
despair and fate and thanks to the singular fascination of my
style had wrought them into new and glowing fabricks instinct with the
eternal vitality of the East For three days after this chit I was
almost too proud to speak to the housemaid with the fanteeth there
is a story about her that I will tell another time On the fourth day
another gentleman made clear that that beautiful style was tortuous
elaborated and inept and it was only on account of the newness of
the subjects handled so crabbedly that I arrested the attention of
the public for a day Then I wept before the housemaid and she
called me a real gentleman because I gave her a shilling

Then I tried an allround cannonpublished one thing under one name
and another under another and sat still to watch A gentleman who
also speaks with authority on Literature and Art came to me and said
I dont deny that there is a great deal of clever and superficial
fooling in that last thing of yours in theIve forgotten what it was
calledbut do you yourself think that you have that curious subtle
grip on and instinct of matters Oriental that that other man shows in
his study of native life And he mentioned the name of my Other Self
I bowed my head and my shoulders shook with repentance and grief
No said I Its so true said he Yes said I So feeling
said he Indeed it is said I Such honest work too said he
Oh awful said I Think it over said he and try to follow his
path I will said I And when he left I danced sarabands with the
housemaid of the fanteeth till she wanted to know whether I had bought
spirruts

Then another man came along and sat on my sofa and hailed me as a
brother And I know that we are kindred souls said he because I
feel sure that you have evolved all the dreamy mystery and curious
brutality of the British soldier from the pure realm of fancy I
did I said If you went into a barrackroom you would see at
once Faugh said he What have we to do with barrackrooms The
pure air of fancy feeds us both keep to that If you are trammelled
by the bitter borne truth you are lost You die the death of
Zola Invention is the only test of creation Of course said I
Zolas a bold bad man Not a patch on you I hadnt caught his
name but I fancied that would prevent him flinging himself about
on my sofa which is a cheap one I dont say that altogether he
said He has his strong points But he is deficient in imaginative
constructiveness You I see from what you have said will belong
to the NeoGynekalistic school I knew Gyne meant something about
cowkilling and was prepared to hedge when he said goodbye and
wrote an article about my ways and works which brought another man to
my door spouting foam

Great Landors ghost he said What under the stars has possessed
you to join the Gynekalistic lot I havent I said I believe in
municipal regulation of slaughterhouses if there is a strong Deputy
Commissioner to control the Muhammadan butchers especially in the
hot weather but This is madness said he Your reputation is
at stake You must make it clear to the world that you have nothing
whatever to do with the flatulent unballasted fiction of Do you
suppose the world cares a tuppeny dam said I

Then he raged afresh and left me pointing out that the Gynewallahs
wrote about nothing but womenwhich seems rather an unlimited
subjectand that I would die the death of a French author whose name I
have forgotten But it wasnt Zola this time

I asked the housemaid what in the world the Gynekalisthenics were La
sir said she its only their way of being rude That fat gentleman
with the long hair tried to kiss me when I opened the door I slapped
his fat chops for him

Now the crisis is at its height All the entire round world composed
as far as I can learn of the Gynekalistic and the antiGynekalistic
man and two or three loafers are trying to find out to what school
I rightly belong They seem to use what they are pleased to call my
reputation as a bolster through which to stab at the foe One gentleman
is proving that I am a bit of a blackguard probably reduced from the
ranks rather an impostor and a considerable amount of plagiarist The
other man denies the reduction from the ranks withholds judgment about
the plagiarism but would like in the interest of the publicwho
are at present exclusively occupied with Barnumto prove it true
and is convinced that my style is hermaphroditic I have all the
money on the first man He is on the eve of discovering that I stole a
dead Tommys diary just before I was drummed out of the service for
desertion and have lived on the proceeds ever since Do yew know
as the Private Secretary said at Simla this year its remarkably hard
for an AngloIndian to get along in England

ON EXHIBITION


It makes me blush pink all over to think about it but none the less
I have brought the tale to you confident that you will understand An
invitation to tea arrived at my address The English are very peculiar
people about their tea They dont seem to understand that it is a
function at which any one who is passing down the Mall may present
himself They issue formal cardsjust as if teadrinking were like
dancing My invitation said that I was to tea from  till  PM
and there was never a word of lawntennis on the whole of the card I
knew the English were heavy eaters but this amazed me What in the
wide world thought I will they find to do for an hour and a half
Perhaps theyll play games as its near Christmas time They cant
sit out in the verandah and chabutras are impossible

Wherefore I went to this house prepared for anything There was a
fine show of damp wraps in the hall and a cheerful babble of voices
from the other side of the drawingroom door The hostess ran at me
vehemently shouting Oh I am so glad you have come We were all
talking about you As the room was entirely filled with strangers
chiefly female I reflected that they couldnt have said anything very
bad Then I was introduced to everybody and some of the people were
talking in couples and didnt want to be interrupted in the least
and some were behind settees and some were in difficulty with their
teacups and one and all had exactly the same name That is the worst
of a lisping hostess

Almost before I had dropped the last limp hand a burly ruffian with a
beard rumbled in my ear I trust you were satisfied with my estimate
of your powers in last weeks Concertina

Now I dont see the Concertina because its too expensive but I
murmured Immense immense Most gratifying Totally undeserved And
the ruffian said In a measure yes Not wholly I flatter myself
that

Oh not in the least said I No sugar thanks This to the
hostess who was waving Sally Lunns under my nose A female who could
not have been less than seven feet high came on half speed ahead
through the fog of the teasteam and docked herself on the sofa just
like an Inman liner

Have you ever considered said she the enormous moral
responsibility that rests in the hands of one who has the gift
of literary expression In my own casebut you surely know my
collaborator

A much huger woman arrived cast anchor and docked herself on the
other side of the sofa She was the collaborator Together they
confided to me that they were desperately in earnest about the
amelioration of something or other Their collective grievance against
me was that I was not in earnest

We have studied your worksall said the fivethousandton
fourmaster and we cannot believe that you are in earnest Oh no
I said hastily I never was Then I saw that that was the wrong thing
to say for the eightthousandton palace Cunarder signalled to the
sister ship saying You see my estimate was correct

Now my complaint against him is that he is too savagely farouche
said a weedy young gentleman with tow hair who ate Sally Lunns like a
workhouse orphan Faroucherie in his age is a fatal mistake

I reflected a moment on the possibility of getting that young gentleman
out into a large and dusty maidan and gently chukkering him before
chota hazri He looked too sleek to me as he then stood But I said
nothing because a tinytiny woman with beadyblack eyes shrilled I
disagree with you entirely He is too much bound by the tradition of
the commonplace I have seen in his later work signs that he is afraid
of his public You must never be afraid of your public

Then they began to discuss me as though I were dead and buried under
the hearthrug and they talked of tones and notes and lights and
shades and tendencies

And which of us do you think is correct in her estimate of your
character said the tinytiny woman when they had made me out a a
giddy Lothario b a savage c a preRafaelite angel d coequal
and coeternal with half a dozen gentlemen whose names I had never
heard e flippant f penetrated with pathos g an open atheist
h a young man of the Roman Catholic faith with a mission in life

I smiled idiotically and said I really didnt know

Then a man entered whom I knew and I fled to him for comfort Have I
missed the fun he asked with a twinkle in his eye

I explained snorting what had befallen

Ay said he quietly you didnt go the right way to work You should
have stood on the hearthrug and fired off epigrams Thats what I did
after I had written Down in the Doldrums and was fed with crumpets
in consequence

A woman plumped down by my side and twisted her hands into knots and
hung her eyes over her cheekbones I thought it was too many muffins
till she said Tell me oh tell me was suchandsuch in such a one
of your bookswas he real Was he quite real Oh how lovely How
sweet How precious She alluded to that drunken ruffian Mulvaney who
would have driven her into fits had he ever set foot on her doorstep in
the flesh I caught the half of a wink in my friends eye as he removed
himself and left me alone to tell fibs about the evolution of Private
Mulvaney I said anything that came uppermost and my answers grew so
wild that the woman departed

Then I heard the hostess whispering to a girl a nice round healthy
English maiden Go and talk to him she said Talk to him about his
books

I gritted my teeth and waited till the maiden was close at hand and
about to begin There was a lovely young man at the end of the room
sucking a stick and I felt sure that the maiden would much have
preferred talking to him She smiled prefatorily

Its hot here I said lets go over to the window and I plumped
down on a threeseated settee with my back to the young man leaving
only one place for the maiden I was right I signalled up the man who
had written Down in the Doldrums and talked to him as fast as I knew
how When he had to go and the young man with him the maiden became
enthusiastic not to say gushing But I knew that those compliments
were for value received Then she explained that she was going out to
India to stay with her married aunt wherefore she became as a sister
unto me on the spot Her mamma did not seem to know much about Indian
outfits and I waxed eloquent on the subject

Its all nonsense I said to fill your boxes with things that can
be made just as well in the country What you want are walkingdresses
and dinnerdresses as good as ever you can get and gloves tinned
up and odds and ends of things generally All the rest unless
youre extravagant the dharzee can make in the verandah Take
underclothing for instance I was conscious that my loud and cheerful
voice was ploughing through one of those ghostly silences that
sometimes fall upon a company The English only wear their outsides in
company They have nothing to do with underclothing I could feel that
without being told So the silence cut short the one matter in which I
could really have been of use

On the pavement my friend who wrote Down in the Doldrums was waiting
to walk home with me What in the world does it all mean I said
Nothing said he Youve been asked there as a small deputy lion to
roar in place of a much bigger man You growled though

I should have done much worse if Id known I grunted Ah said he
you havent arrived at the real fun of the show Wait till theyve
made you jump through hoops and your turns over and you can sit on
a sofa and watch the new men being brought up and put through their
paces Youve nothing like that in India How do you manage your
parties

And I thought of smoothcut lawns in the gloaming and tables spread
under mighty trees and men and women all intimately acquainted with
each other strolling about in the lightest of raiment and the old
dowagers criticising the badminton and the young men in ridingboots
making rude remarks about the claret cup and the host circulating
through the mob and saying Hah Piggy or Bobby or Flatnose as the
nickname might be have another peg and the hostess soothing the
bashful youngsters and talking khitmatgars with the Judges wife and
the last new bride hanging on her husbands arm and saying Isnt it
almost time to go home Dicky dear and the little fat owls chuckling
in the bougainvilleas and the horses stamping and squealing in
the carriagedrive and everybody saying the most awful things about
everybody else but prepared to do anything for anybody else just the
same and I gulped a great gulp of sorrow and homesickness

You wouldnt understand said I to my friend Lets go to a
pothouse where cabbies call and drink something

THE THREE YOUNG MEN

LONDON IN THE FOG


Curiouser and curiouser as Alice in Wonderland said when she found
her neck beginning to grow Each day under the smoke brings me new and
generally unpleasant discoveries The latest are most on my mind I
hasten to transfer them to yours

At first and several times afterwards I very greatly desired to talk
to a thirteentwo subalternnot because he or I would have anything
valuable to say to each other but just because he was a subaltern I
wanted to know all about that evergreen polopony that can turn on
a sixpence and the secondhand second charger that by a series of
perfectly unprecedented misfortunes just failed to win the Calcutta
Derby Then too I wished to hear of many old friends across the
sea and who had got his company and why and where the new Generals
were going next cold weather and how the CommanderinChief had been
enlivening the Simla season So I looked east and west and north and
south but never a thirteentwo subaltern broke through the fog except
onceand he had grown a fifteenone cot down and wore a tall hat
and frock coat and was begging for coppers from the HorseGuards By
the way if you stand long enough between the mounted sentriesthe
men who look like reflectors stolen from Christmas treesyou will
presently meet every human being you ever knew in India When I am
not happythat is to say once a dayI run off and play on the
pavement in front of the HorseGuards and watch the expressions on the
gentlemens faces as they come out But this is a digression

After some daysI grew lonelier and lonelier every hourI went away
to the other end of the town and catching a friend said Lend me a
mana young manto play with I dont feel happy I want rousing I
have liver And the friend said Ah yes of course What you want
is congenial society something that will stir you upa fellowmind
Now let me introduce you to a thoroughly nice young man Hes by way of
being an ardent NeoAlexandrine and has written some charming papers
on the Ethics of the Wood Pavement Concealing my almost visible
rapture I murmured Oh bliss as they used to say at the Gaiety and
extended the hand of friendship to a young gentleman attired after the
fashion of the NeoAlexandrines who appear to be a subcaste of social
priests His hand was a limp hand his face was very smooth because
he had not yet had time to grow any hair and he wore a cloak like a
policemans cloak but much more so On his finger was a cameoring
about three inches wide and round his neck the weather being warm
was a fawn olive and deadleaf comforter of soft silkthe sort of
thing any rightminded man would give to his mother or his sister
without being asked

We looked at each other cautiously for some minutes Then he said
What do you think of the result of the Brighton election Beautiful
beautiful I said watching his eye which saddened One of the
worstthat is entirely the most absurd reductio ad absurdum of the
principle of the narrow and narrowminded majority imposing a will
which is necessarily incult on a minority animated by I forget
exactly what he said they were animated by but it was something very
fine

When I was at Oxford he said Haward of Exeterhe spoke as one
speaks of Smith of Asiaalways inculcated at the UnionBy the way
you do not know I suppose anything of the life at Oxford No I
said anxious to propitiate but I remember some boys once who seduced
an ekka and a pony into a Majors tent at a camp of exercise laced
up the door and let the Major fight it out with the horse I told
that little incident in my best style and was three parts through it
before I discovered that he was looking pained and shocked

Thatahwas not the side of Oxford that I had in mind when I was
saying that Haward of Exeter And he explained all about Mr
Haward who appeared to be a young gentleman rising twentythree
of wonderful mental attainments and as pernicious a prig as I ever
dreamed about Mr Haward had schemes for the better management of
creation my friend told me them allsocial political and economical

Then just as I was feeling faint and very much in need of a drink
he launched without warning upon the boundless seas of literature
He wished to know whether I had read the works of Messrs Guy de
Maupassant Paul Bourget and Pierre Loti This in the tone of a teacher
of Euclid I replied that all my French was confined to the Vie
Parisienne and translations of Zolas novels with illustrations Here
we parted London is very large and I do not think we shall meet any
more

I thanked our Mutual Friend for his kindness and asked for another
young man to play with This gentleman was even younger than the
last but quite as cocksure He told me in the course of half a
cigar that only men of mediocre calibre went into the army which
was a brutalising profession that he suffered from nerves and an
uncontrollable desire to walk up and down the room and sob that was
too many cigarettes and that he had never set foot out of England
but knew all about the world from his own theories Thought Dickens
coarse Scott jingling and meretricious and had not by any chance read
the novels of Messrs Guy de Maupassant Paul Bourget and Pierre Loti

Him I left quickly but sorry that he could not do a six weeks
training with a Middlesex militia regiment where he would really get
something to sob for The novel business interested me I perceived
that it was a fashion like his tie and his collars and I wanted
to work it to the fountainhead To this end I procured the whole
Shibboleth from Guy de Maupassant even unto Pierre Loti by way of
Bourget Unwholesome was a mild term for these interesting books which
the young men assured me that they read for style When a fat Major
makes that remark in an Indian Club everybody hoots and laughs But
you must not laugh overseas especially at young gentlemen who have
been to Oxford and listened to Mr Haward of Exeter

Then I was introduced to another young man who said he belonged to
a movement called Toynbee Hall where I gathered young gentlemen
took an indecent interest in the affairs of another caste whom with
rare tact they called the poor and told them generally how to
order their lives Such was the manner and general aggressiveness of
this third young gentleman that if he had told me that coats were
generally worn and good for the protection of the body I should have
paraded Bond Street in my shirt What the poor thought of him I could
not tell but there is no room for it in this letter He said that
there was going to be an upheaval of the classesthe English are
very funny about their castes They dont know how to handle them
one little bit and never allow them to draw water or build huts in
peaceand the entire social fabric was about to be remodelled on
his recommendations and the world would be generally altered past
recognition No he had never seen anything of the world but close
acquaintance with authorities had enabled him to form dispassionate
judgments on the subjects and had I by any chance read the novels of
Guy de Maupassant Pierre Loti and Paul Bourget

It was a mean thing to do but I couldnt help it I had read em I
put him on so to speak far back in Paul Bourget who is a genial sort
of writer I pinned him to one book He could not escape from Paul
Bourget He was fed with it till he confessedand he had been quite
ready to point out its beautiesthat we could not take much interest
in the theories put forward in that particular book Then I said Get
a dictionary and read him which severed our budding friendship

Thereafter I sought our Mutual Friend and walked up and down his room
sobbing or words to that effect Good gracious said my friend Is
that whats troubling you Now I hold the ravaging rights over half
a dozen fields and a bit of a wood You can pot rabbits there in the
evenings sometimes and anyway you get exercise Come along

So I went I have not yet killed anything but it seems wasteful to
drive good powder and shot after poor little bunnies when there are so
many other things in the world that would be better for an ounce and
a half of number five at sixty yardsnot enough to disable but just
sufficient to sting and be pricked out with a penknife

I should like to wield that penknife

MY GREAT AND ONLY


Whether Macdougal or Macdoodle be his name the principle remains the
same as Mrs Nickleby said The gentleman appeared to hold authority
in London and by virtue of his position preached or ordained that
musichalls were vulgar if not improper Subsequently I gathered
that the gentleman was inciting his associates to shut up certain
musichalls on the ground of the vulgarity aforesaid and I saw with
my own eyes that unhappy little managers were putting notices into the
corners of their programmes begging the audience to report each and
every impropriety That was pitiful but it excited my interest

Now to the upright and impartial mindwhich is mineall the
diversions of Heathendomwhich is the Britishare of equal
ethnological value And it is true that some human beings can be
more vulgar in the act of discussing etchings editions of luxury
or their own emotions than other human beings employed in swearing
at each other across the street Therefore following a chain of
thought which does not matter I visited very many theatres whose
licenses had never been interfered with There I discovered men and
women who lived and moved and behaved according to rules which in no
sort regulate human life by tradition dead and done with and after
the customs of the more immoral ancients and Barnum At one place the
lodginghouse servant was an angel and her mother a Madonna at a
second they sounded the loud timbrel oer a whirl of bloody axes mobs
and brownpaper castles and said it was not a pantomime but Art
at a third everybody grew fabulously rich and fabulously poor every
twenty minutes which was confusing at a fourth they discussed the
Nudities and Lewdities in falsepalate voices supposed to belong to
the aristocracy and that tasted copper in the mouth at a fifth they
merely climbed up walls and threw furniture at each other which is
notoriously the custom of spinsters and small parsons Next morning the
papers would write about the progress of the modern drama that was the
silver paper pantomime and graphic presentment of the realities of
our highly complex civilisation That was the angel housemaid By the
way when an Englishman has been doing anything more than unusually
Pagan he generally consoles himself with overcivilisation Its the
martyrtonervesdear note in his equipment

I went to the musichallsthe less frequented onesand they were
almost as dull as the plays but they introduced me to several
elementary truths Ladies and gentlemen in eccentric but not
altogether unsightly costumes told me a that if I got drunk I should
have a head next morning and perhaps be fined by the magistrate b
that if I flirted promiscuously I should probably get into trouble
c that I had better tell my wife everything and be good to her or
she would be sure to find out for herself and be very bad to me d
that I should never lend money or e fight with a stranger whose form
I did not know My friends if I may be permitted to so call them
illustrated these facts with personal reminiscences and drove them home
with kicks and prancings At intervals circular ladies in pale pink and
white would low to their audience to the effect that there was nothing
half so sweet in life as Loves Young Dream and the billycock hats
would look at the fourandelevenpenny bonnets and they saw that it
was good and clasped hands on the strength of it Then other ladies
with shorter skirts would explain that when their husbands

 Stagger home tight about two
   An cant light the candle
   We taik the broom andle
 An show em what women can do

Naturally the billycocks seeing what might befall thought things
over again and you heard the bonnets murmuring softly under the clink
of the lagerglasses Not me Bill Not me Now these things are
basic and basaltic truths Anybody can understand them They are as old
as Time Perhaps the expression was occasionally what might be called
coarse but beer is beer and best in a pewter though you can if you
please drink it from Venetian glass and call it something else The
halls give wisdom and not too lively entertainment for sixpenceticket
good for four penorth of refreshments chiefly inky porterand the
people who listen are respectable folk living under very grey skies who
derive all the light side of their life the food for their imagination
and the crystallised expression of their views on Fate and Nemesis
from the affable ladies and gentlemen singers They require a few
green and gold maidens in short skirts to kick before them Herein
they are no better and no worse than folk who require fifty girls very
much undressed and a setting of music or pictures that wont let
themselves be seen on account of their age and varnish or statues and
coins All animals like salt but some prefer rocksalt red or black
in lumps But this is a digression

Out of my many visits to the hallI chose one hall you understand
and frequented it till I could tell the mood it was in before I had
passed the ticketpollwas born the Great Idea I served it as a slave
for seven days Thought was not sufficient experience was necessary
I patrolled Westminster Blackfriars Lambeth the Old Kent Road and
many many more miles of pitiless pavement to make sure of my subject
At even I drank my lager among the billycocks and lost my heart to
a bonnet Goethe and Shakespeare were my precedents I sympathised
with them acutely but I got my Message A chancecaught refrain of a
song which I understand is protectedto its maker I convey my most
grateful acknowledgmentsgave me what I sought The rest was made up
of four elementary truths some humour and though I say it who should
leave it to the press pathos deep and genuine I spent a penny on a
paper which introduced me to a Great and Only who wanted new songs
The people desired them really He was their ambassador and taught
me a great deal about the propertyright in songs concluding with
a practical illustration for he said my verses were just the thing
and annexed them It was long before he could hit on the stepdance
which exactly elucidated the spirit of the text and longer before he
could jingle a pair of huge brass spurs as a dancinggirl jingles her
anklets That was my notion and a good one

The Great and Only possessed a voice like a bull and nightly roared
to the people at the heels of one who was winning triple encores
with a priceless ballad beginning deep down in the bass We was
shopmatesboozin shopmates I feared that song as Rachel feared
Ristori A greater than I had written it It was a grim tragedy
lighted with lucid humour wedded to music that maddened But my Great
and Only had faith in me and II clung to the Great Heart of the
Peoplemy peoplefour hundred when its all full sir I had not
studied them for nothing I must reserve the description of my triumph
for another Turnover

There was no portent in the sky on the night of my triumph A
barrowful of onions indeed upset itself at the door but that was
a coincidence The hall was crammed with billycocks waiting for We
was shopmates The great heart beat healthily I went to my beer the
equal of Shakespeare and Molire at the wings in a first night What
would my public say Could anything live after the abandon of We
was shopmates What if the redcoats did not muster in their usual
strength O my friends never in your songs and dramas forget the
redcoat He has sympathy and enormous boots

I believed in the redcoat in the great heart of the people above all
in myself The conductor who advertised that he doctored bad songs
had devised a pleasant little lilting air for my needs but it struck
me as weak and thin after the thunderous surge of the Shopmates
I glanced at the gallerythe redcoats were there The fiddlebows
creaked and with a jingle of brazen spurs a foragecap over his
left eye my Great and Only began to chuck it off his chest Thus

 At the back o the Knightsbridge Barricks
   When the fog was agatherin dim
 The Lifeguard talked to the Undercook
   An the girl she talked to im

Twiddleiddleiddlelumtumtum said the violins

Lingalingalingalingtingling said the spurs of the Great
and Only and through the roar in my ears I fancied I could catch a
responsive hoofbeat in the gallery The next four lines held the
house to attention Then came the chorus and the borrowed refrain
It tookit went home with a crisp click My Great and Only saw his
chance Superbly waving his hand to embrace the whole audience he
invited them to join him in

 You may make a mistake when youre mashing a tart
   But youll learn to be wise when youre older
 And dont try for things that are out of your reach
   And thats what the girl told the soldier soldier soldier
 And thats what the girl told the soldier

I thought the gallery would never let go of the longdrawn howl on
soldier They clung to it as ringers to the kicking bellrope Then
I envied no onenot even Shakespeare I had my house hookedgaffed
under the gills netted speared shot behind the shoulderanything
you please That was pure joy With each verse the chorus grew louder
and when my Great and Only had bellowed his way to the fall of the
Lifeguard and the happy lot of the Undercook the gallery rocked again
the reserved stalls shouted and the pewters twinkled like the legs
of the demented balletgirls The conductor waved the now frenzied
orchestra to softer Lydian strains My Great and Only warbled piano

 At the back o Knightsbridge Barricks
   When the fogs agatherin dim
 The Lifeguard waits for the Undercook
   But she wont wait for im

Tararararararararah rang a horn clear and fresh as a
swordcut Twas the apotheosis of virtue

 Shes married a man in the poultry line
   That lives at Ighgate Ill
 An the Lifeguard walks with the ousemaid now
   An awful pause she cant foot the bill

Who shall tell the springs that move masses I had builded better
than I knew Followed yells shrieks and wildest applause Then as a
wave gathers to the curlover singer and sung to fill their chests
and heave the chorus through the quivering roofalto horns basses
drowned and lost in the floodto the beachlike boom of beating feet

 Oh think o my song when youre gowin it strong
   An your boots is too little to old yer
 An dont try for things that is out of your reach
   An thats what the girl told the soldier soldier soholdier

Ow Hi Yi Whahup Phew Whew Pwhit Bang Wang Crrrash There was
ample time for variations as the horns uplifted themselves and ere the
held voices came down in the foam of sound

 Thats what the girl told the soldier

Providence has sent me several joys and I have helped myself to
others but that night as I looked across the sea of tossing
billycocks and rocking bonnets my work as I heard them give tongue
not once but four timestheir eyes sparkling their mouths twisted
with the taste of pleasureI felt that I had secured Perfect Felicity
I am become greater than Shakespeare I may even write plays for
the Lyceum but I never can recapture that first fine rapture that
followed the Upheaval of the AngloSaxon four hundred of him and her
They do not call for authors on these occasions but I desired no need
of public recognition I was placidly happy The chorus bubbled up
again and again throughout the evening and a redcoat in the gallery
insisted on singing solos about a swine in the poultry line whereas
I had written man and the pewters began to fly and afterwards the
long streets were vocal with various versions of what the girl had
really told the soldier and I went to bed murmuring I have found my
destiny

But it needs a more mighty intellect to write the Songs of the People
Some day a man will rise up from Bermondsey Battersea or Bow and he
will be coarse but clearsighted hard but infinitely and tenderly
humorous speaking the peoples tongue steeped in their lives and
telling them in swinging urging dinging verse what it is that their
inarticulate lips would express He will make them songs Such songs
And all the little poets who pretend to sing to the people will scuttle
away like rabbits for the girl which as you have seen of course
is wisdom will tell that soldier which is Hercules bowed under his
labours all that she knows of Life and Death and Love

And the same they say is a Vulgarity

THE BETRAYAL OF CONFIDENCES


That was its real name and its nature was like unto it but what else
could I do You must judge for me

They brought a cardthe housemaid with the fanteeth held it gingerly
between black finger and blacker thumband it carried the name Mr
RH Hoffer in old Gothic letters A hasty rush through the file of
bills showed me that I owed nothing to any Mr Hoffer and assuming my
sweetest smile I bade Fan of the Teeth show him up Enter stumblingly
an entirely canarycoloured young person about twenty years of age
with a suspicious bulge in the bosom of his coat He had grown no hair
on his face his eyes were of a delicate watergreen and his hat
was a brown billycock which he fingered nervously As the room was
blue with tobaccosmoke and Latakia at that he coughed even more
nervously and began seeking for me I hid behind the writingtable and
took notes What I most noted was the bulge in his bosom When a man
begins to bulge as to that portion of his anatomy hit him in the eye
for reasons which will be apparent later on

He saw me and advanced timidly I invited him seductively to the only
other chair and Whats the trouble said I

I wanted to see you said he

I am me said I

III thought you would be quite otherwise said he

I am on the contrary completely this way said I Sit still take
your time and tell me all about it

He wriggled tremulously for three minutes and coughed again I
surveyed him and waited developments The bulge under the bosom
crackled Then I frowned At the end of three minutes he began

I wanted to see what you were like said he

I inclined my head stiffly as though all London habitually climbed the
storeys on the same errand and rather wearied me

Then he delivered himself of a speech which he had evidently got by
heart He flushed painfully in the delivery

I am flattered I said at the conclusion Its beastly gratifying
What do you want

Advice if you will be so good said the young man

Then you had better go somewhere else said I

The young man turned pink But I thought after I had read your
worksall your works on my wordI had hoped that you would
understand me and I really have come for advice The bulge crackled
more ominously than ever

I understand perfectly said I You are oppressed with vague and
nameless longings are you not

I am terribly said he

You do not wish to be as other men are You desire to emerge from the
common herd to make your mark and so forth

Yes said he in an awestricken whisper That is my desire

Also said I you love excessively in several places at once
cooks housemaids governesses schoolgirls and the aunts of other
people

But one only said he and the pink deepened to beetroot

Consequently said I you have written muchyou have written
verses

It was to teach me to write prose only to teach me to write prose
he murmured You do it yourself because I have bought your worksall
your works

He spoke as if he had purchased dunghills en bloc

We will waive that question I said loftily Produce the verses

Theythey arent exactly verses said the young man plunging his
hand into his bosom

I beg your pardon I meant will you be good enough to read your
fiveact tragedy

Howhow in the world did you know said the young man more
impressed than ever

He unearthed his tragedy the title of which I have given and began
to read I felt as though I were walking in a dream having been till
then ignorant of the fact that earth held young men who held fiveact
tragedies in their insides The young man gave me the whole of the
performance from the preliminary scene where nothing more than an
eruption of Vesuvius occurs to mar the serenity of the manager till
the very end where the Roman sentry of Pompeii is slowly banked up
with ashes in the presence of the audience and dies murmuring through
his helmetvizor SPQRRIPRSVP or words to that effect

For three hours and onehalf he read to me And then I made a mistake

Sir said I whos your Ma and Pa

I havent got any said he and his lower lip quivered

Where do you live I said

At the back of Tarporley Mews said he

How said I

On eleven shillings a week said he

I was pretty well educated and if you dont stay too long they will
let you read the books in the Holywell Street stalls

And you wasted your money buying my books said I with a lump the
size of a bolster in my throat

I got them secondhand four and sixpence said he and some I
borrowed

Then I collapsed I didnt weep but I took the tragedy and put it in
the fire and called myself every name that I knew

This caused the young man to sob audibly partly from emotion and
partly from lack of food

I took off my hat to him before I showed him out and we went to a
restaurant and I arranged things generally on a financial basis

Would that I could let the tale stop here But I cannot

Three days later a man came to see me on business an objectionable man
of uncompromising truth Just before he departed he said D you know
anything about the struggling author of a tragedy called The Betrayal
of Confidences

Yes said I One of the few poor souls who in the teeth of grinding
poverty keep alight

At the back of Tarporley Mews said he On eleven shillings a week

On the mischief said I

He didnt happen to tell you that he considered you the finest
subtlest truest and so forth of all the living so forths did he

He may have said something out of the fulness of an overladen heart
You know how unbridled is the enthusiasm of

Young gentlemen who buy your books with their last farthing You
didnt soak it all in by any chance give him a good meal and half a
sovereign as well did you

I own up I said I did all that and more But how do you know

Because he victimised me in the same way a fortnight ago

Thank you for that I said but I burned his disgusting manuscripts
And he wept

There unless he keeps a duplicate you have scored one

But considering the matter impartially it seems to me that the game is
not more than fifteen all in any light

It makes me blush to think about it

THE NEW DISPENSATIONI

LONDON IN A FOGNOVEMBER


Things have happenedbut that is neither here nor there What I
urgently require is a servanta nice fat Mussulman khitmatgar
who is not above doing bearers work on occasion Such a man I would
go down to Southampton or Tilbury to meet would usher tenderly into
a firstclass carriage I always go third myself and wrap in the
warmest of flannel He should be Jenab and I would be O Tum
When he died as he assuredly would in this weather I would bury him
in my best back garden and write mortuary verses for publication in the
KohiNur or whatever vernacular paper he might read I want in
short a servant and this is why I am writing to you

The English who by the way are unmitigated barbarians maintain
cottonprint housemaids to do work which is the manifest portion of a
man Besides which no properly constructed person cares to see a white
woman waiting upon his needs filling coalscuttles these are very
mysterious beasts and tidying rooms The young homebred Englishman
does not object and one of the most tantalising sights in the world
is that of the young man of the housethe son newly introduced to
shavingwater and great on the subject of maintaining authorityit is
tantalising I say to see this young cub hectoring a miserable little
slavey for not having lighted a fire or put his slippers in their
proper place The next time a big bold man from the frontier comes
home I shall hire him to kick a few young gentlemen of my acquaintance
all round their own drawingrooms while I lecture on my theory that
this sort of thing accounts for the perceptible lack of chivalry in
the modern Englishman Now if you or I or anybody else raved over and
lectured at Kadir Baksh or Ram Singh or Jagesa on the necessity of
obeying orders and the beauty of reverencing our noble selves our men
would laugh or if the lecture struck them as too longwinded would ask
us if our livers were out of order and recommend dawai The housemaid
must stand with her eyes on the ground while the young whelp sticks
his hands under the tail of his dressinggown and explains her duty to
her This makes me ill and sicksick for Kadir Baksh who rose from
the earth when I called him who knew the sequence of my papers and
the ordering of my paltry garments and I verily believed loved me
not altogether for the sake of lucre He said he would come with me to
Belait because though the sahib says he will never return to India
yet I know and all the other nauker log know that return is his
fate

Being a fool I left Kadir Baksh behind and now I am alone with
housemaids who will under no circumstances sleep on the mat outside
the door Even as I write one of these persons is cleaning up my room
Kadir Baksh would have done his work without noise She tramps and
scuffles and what is much worse snuffles horribly Kadir Baksh would
have saluted me cheerfully and began some sort of a yarn of the It
hath reached me O Auspicious King order and perhaps we should have
debated over the worthlessness of Dunni the sais or the chances of
a little coldweather expedition or the wisdom of retaining a fresh
chaprassisome intimate friend of Kadir Baksh But now I have no
horses and no chaprassis and this smuttyfaced girl glares at me
across the room as though she expected I was going to eat her

She must have a soul of her owna life of her ownand perhaps a few
amusements I cant get at these things She says Ho yuss and
Ho no and if I hadnt heard her chattering to the liftboy on the
stairs I should think that her education stopped at these two phrases
Now I knew all about Kadir Baksh his hopes and his savingshis
experiences in the past and the health of the little ones He was a
mana human man remarkably like myself and he knew that as well as
I A housemaid is of course not a man but she might at least be a
woman My wanderings about this amazing heathen city have brought me
into contact with very many English mem sahibs who seem to be eaten
up with the fear of letting their servants get above their position
or presume or do something which would shake the foundations of the
fourmile cab radius They seem to carry on a sort of catandmouse war
when the husband is at office and they have nothing much to do Later
at places where their friends assemble they recount the campaign and
the other women purr approvingly and say You did quite right my
dear It is evident that she forgets her place

All this is edifying to the stranger and gives him a great idea of
the dignity that has to be bolstered and buttressed eight hours of
the twentyfour against the incendiary attacks of an eighteenpound
includingbeermoney sleepsinagarretatthetopofthehouse
servantgirl There is a finecrusted slaveholding instinct in the
hearts of a good many deepbosomed matronsa throw back to the
times when we trafficked in black ivory At teatables and places
where they eat muffins it is called dignity Now your Kadir Baksh or
my Kadir Baksh who is a downtrodden and oppressed heathen the young
gentlemen who bullyrag white women assure me that we are in the habit
of kicking our dependents and beating them with umbrellas daily
would ask for his chits and probably say something sarcastic ere he
drifted out of the compound gate if you nagged or worried his noble
self He does not know much about the meaner forms of dignity but
he is entirely sound on the subject of izzat and the fact of his
cracking an azure and Oriental jest with you in the privacy of your
dressingroom or seeing you at your incoherent worst when you have an
attack of fever does not in the least affect his general deportment in
public where he knows that the honour of his sahib is his own honour
and dons a new kummerbund on the strength of it

I have tried to deal with those housemaids in every possible way
To sling a blunt Annie or Mary or Jane at a girl whose only
fault is that she is a heavyhanded incompetent strikes me as rather
an insult seeing that the girl may have a brother and that if you
had a sister who was a servant you would object to her being howled
at upstairs and downstairs by her given name But only ladies maids
are entitled to their surnames They are not nice people as a caste
and they regard the housemaids as the chamar regards the mehter
Consequently I have to call these girls by their Christian names and
cock my feet up on a chair when they are cleaning the grate and pass
them in the halls in the morning as though they didnt exist Now the
morning salutation of your Kadir Baksh or my Kadir is a performance
which Turveydrop might envy These persons dont understand a nod they
think it as bad as a wink I believe Respect and courtesy are lost
upon them and I suppose I must gather my dressinggown into a tail and
swear at them in the bloodless voice affected by the British female
whohave I mentioned thisis a highly composite heathen when she
comes in contact with her sister clay downstairs

The softer methods lay one open to harder suspicions Not long
ago there was trouble among my shirts I fancied buttons grew on
neckbands Kadir Baksh and the durzie encouraged me in the belief
When the leadcoloured linen they cannot wash by the way in this
stronghold of infidels shed its buttons I cast about for a means
of renewal There was a housemaid and she was not very ugly and
I thought she could sew I knew I could not Therefore I strove to
ingratiate myself with her believing that a little interest combined
with a little capital would fix those buttons more firmly than
anything else Subsequently and after an intervalthe buttons were
dropping like autumn leavesI kissed her The buttons were attached at
once So unluckily was the housemaid for I gathered that she looked
forward to a lifetime of shirtsewing in an official capacity and my
Revenue Board contemplated no additional establishment My shirts are
buttonsome but my character is blasted Oh I wish I had Kadir Baksh

This is only the first instalment of my troubles The heathen in these
parts do not understand me so if you will allow I will come to you for
sympathy from time to time I am a child of calamity

THE NEW DISPENSATIONII


Writing of Kadir Baksh so wrought up my feelings that I could not rest
till I had at least made an attempt to get a budli of some sort
The black man is essential to my comfort I fancied I might in this
city of barbarism catch a brokendown native strayed from his home and
friends who would be my friend and humble pardnerthe sort of man y
know who would sleep on a rug somewhere near my chambers I have forty
things to tell you about chambers but they come later and generally
look after my things In the intervals of labour I would talk to him in
his own tongue and we would go abroad together and explore London

Do you know the Albert Docks The BritishIndia steamers go thence
to the sunshine They sometimes leave a lascar or two on the wharf
and in fact the general tone of the population thereabouts is brown
and umber I was in no case to be particular Anything dusky would do
for me so long as it could talk Hindustani and sew buttons I went
to the docks and walked about generally among the railway lines and
packingcases till I found a man selling toothcombs which is not a
paying trade He was ragged even to furriness and very unwashed But
he came from the East What are you I said and the look of the
missionary that steals over me in moments of agitation deluded that
toothcomb man into answering Sar I am native kilistian but he
put five more syllables into the last word

There is no Christianity in the docks worth a toothcomb I dont want
your beliefs I want your jat said I

I am Tamil said he and my name is Ramasawmy

It was an awful thing to lower oneself to the level of a Colonel of
the Madras Army and come down to being tended by a Ramasawmy but
beggars cannot be choosers I pointed out to him that the toothcomb
trade was a thing lightly to be dropped and taken up He might injure
his health by a washing but he could not much hurt his prospects by
coming along with me and trying his hand at bearers work Could he
work Oh yes he didnt mind work He had been a servant in his time
Several servants in fact

Could he wash himself

Yees he might do that if I gave him a coata thick
coatafterwards and especially took care of the toothcombs for they
were his little all

Had he any character of any kind

He thought for a minute and then said cheerfully Not a little dam
Thereat I loved him because a man who can speak the truth in minor
matters may be trusted with important things such as shirts

We went home together till we struck a public bath mercifully divided
into three classes I got him to go into the third without much
difficulty When he came out he was in the way of cleanliness and
before he had time to expostulate I ran him into the second Into the
first he would not go till I had bought him a cheap ulster He came
out almost clean That cost me three shillings altogether The ulster
was half a sovereign and some other clothes were thirty shillings
Even these things could not hide from me that he looked an unusually
villainous creature

At the chambers the trouble began The people in charge had race
prejudices very strongly and I had to point out that he was a
civilised native Christian anxious to improve his Englishit was
fluent but unchastenedbefore they would give him some sort of a crib
to lie down in The housemaids called him the Camel I introduced him
as the Tamil but they knew nothing of the ethnological subdivisions
of India They called him that there beastly camel and I saw by the
light in his eye he understood only too well

Coming up the staircase he confided to me his views about the
housemaids He had lived at the docks too long I said they werent He
said they were

Then I showed him his duties and he stood long in thought before
the wardrobe He evidently knew more than a little of the work but
whenever he came to a more than unusually dilapidated garment he said
No good for you I take and he took Then he put all the buttons
on in the smoking of a pipe and asked if there was anything else I
weakly said No He said Goodbye and faded out of the house The
housekeeper of the chambers said he would never return

But he did At three in the morning home he came and naturally
possessing no latchkey rang the bell A policeman interfered taking
him for a burglar and I was roused by the racket I explained he was
my servant and the policeman said He do swear wonderful Taint
any language I know most of it but some Ive heard at Poplar Then
I dragged the Camel upstairs He was quite sober and said he had
been waiting at the docks He must wait at the docks every time a
BritishIndia steamer came in A lascar on the Rewah had stabbed him
in the side three voyages ago and he was waiting for his man Maybe
he have died he said but if he have not died I catch him and cut
his liver out Then he curled himself up on the mat and slept as
noiselessly as a child

Next morning he inspected the humble breakfast bloater which did not
meet with his approval for he instantly cut it in two pieces fried
it with butter dusted it with pepper and miraculously made of it a
dish fit for a king When the shockheaded boy came to take away the
breakfast things he counted every piece of crockery into his quaking
hand and said If you break one dam thing I cut your dam liver out and
fly him with butter Consequently the housemaids said they were not
going to clean the rooms as long as the Camel abode within The Camel
put his head out of the door and said they need not He cleaned the
rooms with his own hand and without noise filled my pipe made the
bed filled a pipe for himself and sat down on the hearthrug while
I worked When thought carried him away to the lascar of the Rewah
he would brandish the poker or take out his knife and whet it on the
brickwork of the grate It was a soothing sound to work to At one
oclock he said that the Chyebassa would be in and he must go He
demanded no money saw that my tiffin was served and fled He returned
at six oclock singing a hymn A lascar on the Chyebassa had told
him that the Rewah was due in four days and that his friend was not
dead but ripe for the knife That night he got very drunk while I was
out and frightened the housemaids All the chambers were in an uproar
but he crawled out of the skylight on the roof and sat there till I
came home

In the dawn he was very penitent He had misarranged his drink the
original intention being to sleep it off on my hearthrug but a
housemaid had invited a friend up to the chambers to look at him and
the whispered comments and giggles made him angry All next day he was
restless but attentive He urged me to fly to foreign shores and take
him with me When other inducements failed he reiterated that he was a
native kilistian and whetted his knife more furiously than ever
You do not like this place I do not like this place Let us travel
dam quick Let us go on the sea I cook blotters I told him this
was impossible but that if he stayed in my service we might later go
abroad and enjoy ourselves

But he would not rest and sleep on the rug and tend my shirts On the
morning of the Rewahs arrival he went away and from his absence I
fancied he had fallen into the hands of the law But at midnight he
came back weak and husky

Have got him said he simply and dragged his ulster down from the
wall wrapping it very tightly round him Now I go way

He went into the bedroom and began counting over the tale of the
weeks wash the boots and so forth All right he called into the
other room Then came in to say goodbye walking slowly

Whats your name marshter said he I told him He bowed and
descended the staircase painfully I had not paid him a penny and
since he did not ask for it counted on his returning at least for
wages

It was not till next morning that I found big dark drops on most of my
clean shirts and the housemaid complained of a trail of blood all down
the staircase

The Camel had received payment in full from other hands than mine

THE LAST OF THE STORIES


  Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better than that a man
  should rejoice in his own works for that is his portion

 Ecc iii 

Kench with a long hand lazy one I said to the punkah coolie But
I am tired said the coolie Then go to Jehannum and get another man
to pull I replied which was rude and when you come to think of it
unnecessary

Happy thoughtgo to Jehannum said a voice at my elbow I turned
and saw seated on the edge of my bed a large and luminous Devil
Im not afraid I said Youre an illusion bred by too much tobacco
and not enough sleep If I look at you steadily for a minute you will
disappear You are an ignis fatuus

Fatuous yourself answered the Devil blandly Do you mean to say
you dont know me He shrivelled up to the size of a blob of
sediment on the end of a pen and I recognised my old friend the Devil
of Discontent who lived in the bottom of the inkpot but emerges
half a day after each story has been printed with a host of useless
suggestions for its betterment

Oh its you is it I said Youre not due till next week Get back
to your inkpot

Hush said the Devil I have an idea

Too late as usual I know your ways

No Its a perfectly practicable one Your swearing at the coolie
suggested it Did you ever hear of a man called Dantecharmin fellow
friend o mine

Dante once prepared to paint a picture I quoted

Yes I inspired that notionbut never mind Are you willing to play
Dante to my Virgil I cant guarantee a ninecircle Inferno any more
than you can turn out a cantoed epic but theres absolutely no risk
andit will run to three columns at least

But what sort of Hell do you own I said I fancied your operations
were mostly above ground You have no jurisdiction over the dead

Sainted Leopardi rapped the Devil resuming natural size Is
that all you know Im proprietor of one of the largest Hells in

Characters What Characters

All the characters that are drawn in books painted in novels
sketched in magazine articles thumbnailed in feuilletons or in
any way created by anybody and everybody who has had the fortune or
misfortune to put his or her writings into print

That sounds like a quotation from a prospectus What do you herd
Characters for Arent there enough souls in the Universe

Who possess souls and who do not For aught you can prove man may be
soulless and the creatures he writes about immortal Anyhow about a
hundred years after printing became an established nuisance the loose
Characters used to blow about interplanetary space in legions which
interfered with traffic So they were collected and their charge
became mine by right Would you care to see them Your own are there

That decides me But is it hotter than Northern India

On my Devildom no Put your arms round my neck and sit tight Im
going to dive

He plunged from the bed headfirst into the floor There was a smell of
jaildurrie and damp earth and then fell the black darkness of night

                                   

We stood before a door in a topless wall from the further side of
which came faintly the roar of infernal fires

But you said there was no danger I cried in an extremity of terror

No more there is said the Devil Thats only the Furnace of First
Edition Will you go on No other human being has set foot here in the
flesh Let me bring the door to your notice Pretty design isnt it A
joke of the Masters

I shuddered for the door was nothing more than a coffin the backboard
knocked out set on end in the thickness of the wall As I hesitated
the silence of space was cut by a sharp shrill whistle like that of
a live shell which rapidly grew louder and louder Get away from the
door said the Devil of Discontent quickly Heres a soul coming to
its place I took refuge under the broad vans of the Devils wings
The whistle rose to an earsplitting shriek and a naked soul flashed
past me

Always the same said the Devil quietly These little writers
are so anxious to reach their reward Hm I dont think he likes
hisn though A yell of despair reached my ears and I shuddered
afresh Who was he I asked Hackwriter for a pornographic firm in
Belgium exporting to London youll understand presentlyand now
well go in said the Devil I must apologise for that creatures
rudeness He should have stopped at the distancesignal for lineclear
You can hear the souls whistling there now

Are they the souls of men I whispered

Yeswritermen Thats why they are so shrill and querulous Welcome
to the Limbo of Lost Endeavour

They passed into a domed hall more vast than visions could embrace
crowded to its limit by men women and children Round the eye of the
dome ran a flickering fire that terrible quotation from Job Oh
that mine enemy had written a book

Neat isnt it said the Devil following my glance Another joke
of the Masters Man of Us y know In the old days we used to put
the Characters into a disused circle of Dantes Inferno but they grew
overcrowded So Balzac and Thophile Gautier were commissioned to write
up this building It took them three years to complete and is one of
the finest under earth Dont attempt to describe it unless you are
quite sure you are equal to Balzac and Gautier in collaboration Look
at the crowds and tell me what you think of them

I looked long and earnestly and saw that many of the multitude were
cripples They walked on their heels or their toes or with a list to
the right or left A few of them possessed odd eyes and particoloured
hair more threw themselves into absurd and impossible attitudes and
every fourth woman seemed to be weeping

Who are these I said

Mainly the population of threevolume novels that never reach the
sixshilling stage See that beautiful girl with one grey eye and one
brown and the black and yellow hair Let her be an awful warning to
you how you correct your proofs She was created by a careless writer a
month ago and he changed all colours in the second volume So she came
here as you see her There will be trouble when she meets her author
He cant alter her now and she says shell accept no apology

But when will she meet her author

Not in my department Do you notice a general air of expectancy
among all the Characters They are waiting for their authors Look
That explains the system better than I can

A lovely maiden at whose feet I would willingly have fallen and
worshipped detached herself from the crowd and hastened to the door
through which I had just come There was a prolonged whistle without
a soul dashed through the coffin and fell upon her neck The girl with
the particoloured hair eyed the couple enviously as they departed arm
in arm to the other side of the hall

That man said the Devil wrote one magazine story of twentyfour
pages ten years ago when he was desperately in love with a flesh and
blood woman He put all his heart into the work and created the girl
you have just seen The flesh and blood woman married some one else and
diedits a way they havebut the man has this girl for his very
own and she will everlastingly grow sweeter

Then the Characters are independent

Slightly Have you never known one of your Characterseven yoursget
beyond control as soon as they are made

Thats true Where are those two happy creatures going

To the Levels Youve heard of authors finding their levels We keep
all the Levels here As each writer enters he picks up his Characters
or they pick him up as the case may be and to the Levels he goes

I should like to see

So you shall when you come through that door a second
timewhistling I cant take you there now

Do you keep only the Characters of living scribblers in this hall

We should be crowded out if we didnt draft them off somehow Step
this way and Ill take you to the Master One moment though Theres
John Ridd with Lorna Doone and there are Mr Maliphant and the
Bormalacksclannish folk those Besant Charactersdont let the twins
talk to you about Literature and Art Come along Whats here

The white face of Mr John Oakhurst gambler broke through the press
I wish to explain said he in a level voice that had I been
consulted I should never have blown out my brains with the Duchess and
all that Poker Flat lot I wish to add that the only woman I ever loved
was the wife of Brown of Calaveras He pressed his hand behind him
suggestively All right Mr Oakhurst I said hastily I believe
you Kin you set it right he asked dropping into the Doric of
the Gulches I caught a triggers clothmuffled click Just heavens
I groaned Must I be shot for the sake of another mans Characters
Oakhurst levelled his revolver at my head but the weapon was struck
up by the hand of Yuba Bill You durned fool said the stagedriver
Hevnt I told you no one but a blamed idiot shoots at sight now
Let the galoot go You kin see by his eyes hes no party to your
matrimonial arrangements Oakhurst retired with an irreproachable bow
but in my haste to escape I fell over Caliban his head in a melon and
his tame orc under his arm He spat like a wildcat

Manners none customs beastly said the Devil Well take the Bishop
with us They all respect the Bishop And the great Bishop Blougram
joined us calm and smiling with the news for my private ear that
Mr Gigadibs despised him no longer

We were arrested by a knot of seminude Bacchantes kissing a clergyman
The Bishops eyes twinkled and I turned to the Devil for explanation

Thats Robert Elsmerewhats left of him said the Devil Those are
French feuilleton women and scourings of the Opera Comique He has
been lecturing em and they dont like it He lectured me said
the Bishop with a bland smile He has been a nuisance ever since he
came here By the Holy Law of Proportion he had the audacity to talk
to the Master Called him a potbellied barbarian That is why he
is walking so stiffly now said the Devil Listen Marie Pigeonnier
is swearing deathless love to him On my word we ought to segregate
the French characters entirely By the way your regiment came in very
handy for Zolas importations

My regiment I said How do you mean

You wrote something about the Tyneside TailTwisters just enough to
give the outline of the regiment and of course it came down hereone
thousand and eighty strong I told it off in hollow squares to pen
up the RougonMacquart series There they are I looked and saw the
Tyneside TailTwisters ringing an inferno of struggling shouting
blaspheming men and women in the costumes of the Second Empire Now and
again the shadowy ranks brought down their butts on the toes of the
crowd inside the square and shrieks of pain followed You should have
indicated your men more clearly they are hardly up to their work
said the Devil If the Zola tribe increase Im afraid I shall have
to use up your two companies of the Black Tyrone and two of the Old
Regiment

I am proud I began

Go slow said the Devil You wont be half so proud in a little
while and I dont think much of your regiments anyway But they are
good enough to fight the French Can you hear Coupeau raving in the
left angle of the square He used to run about the hall seeing pink
snakes till the childrens storybook Characters protested Come
along

Never since Caxton pulled his first proof and made for the world a
new and most terrible God of Labour had mortal man such an experience
as mine when I followed the Devil of Discontent through the shifting
crowds below the motto of the Dome A fewa very fewof the faces
were of old friends but there were thousands whom I did not recognise
Men in every conceivable attire and of every possible nationality
deformed by intention or the impotence of creation that could not
createblind unclean heroic mad sinking under the weight of
remorse or with eyes made splendid by the light of love and fixed
endeavour women fashioned in ignorance and mourning the errors of
their creator life and thought at variance with body and soul perfect
women such as walk rarely upon this earth and horrors that were women
only because they had not sufficient selfcontrol to be fiends little
children fair as the morning who put their hands into mine and made
most innocent confidences loathsome lankhaired infantsaints
curious as to the welfare of my soul and delightfully mischievous
boys generalled by the irrepressible Tom Sawyer who played among
murderers harlots professional beauties nuns Italian bandits and
politicians of state

The ordered peace of Arthurs Court was broken up by the incursions
of Mr John Wellington Wells and Dagonet the jester found that his
antics drew no attention so long as the dealer in magic and spells
taking Tristrams harp sang pattersongs to the Round Table while a
Zulu Impi headed by Allan Quatermain wheeled and shouted in sham
fight for the pleasure of Little Lord Fauntleroy Every century and
every type was jumbled in the confusion of one colossal fancyball
where all the characters were living their parts

Aye look long said the Devil You will never be able to describe
it and the next time you come you wont have the chance Look long
and look atGoods passing with a maiden of the ZuVendi must have
suggested the idealook at their legs I looked and for the second
time noticed the lameness that seemed to be almost universal in the
Limbo of Lost Endeavour Brave men and stalwart to all appearance had
one leg shorter than the other some paced a few inches above the
floor never touching it and others found the greatest difficulty in
preserving their feet at all The stiffness and laboured gait of these
thousands was pitiful to witness I was sorry for them I told the
Devil as much

Hm said he reflectively thats the worlds work Rather cockeye
aint it They do everything but stand on their feet You could
improve them I suppose There was an unpleasant sneer in his tone
and I hastened to change the subject

Im tired of walking I said I want to see some of my own
Characters and go on to the Master whoever he may be afterwards

Reflect said the Devil Are you certaindo you know how many they
be

Nobut I want to see them Thats what I came for

Very well Dont abuse me if you dont like the view There are
oneandfifty of your make up to date andits rather an appalling
thing to be confronted with fiftyone children However heres a
special favourite of yours Go and shake hands with her

A limpjointed staringeyed doll was hirpling towards me with a
strained smile of recognition I felt that I knew her only too wellif
indeed she were she Keep her off Devil I cried stepping back I
never made that She began to weep and she began to cry Lord ha
mercy on me this is none of I Youre very rude toMrs Hauksbee
and she wants to speak to you said the Devil My face must have
betrayed my dismay for the Devil went on soothingly Thats as she
is remember I knew you wouldnt like it Now what will you give
if I make her as she ought to be No I dont want your soul thanks
I have it already and many others of better quality Will you when
you write your story own that I am the best and greatest of all
the Devils The doll was creeping nearer Yes I said hurriedly
Anything you like Only I cant stand her in that state

Youll have to when you come next again Look No connection with
Jekyll and Hyde The Devil pointed a lean and inky finger towards the
doll and lo radiant bewitching with a smile of dainty malice her
high heels clicking on the floor like castanets advanced Mrs Hauksbee
as I had imagined her in the beginning

Ah she said You are here so soon Not dead yet That will come
Meantime a thousand congratulations And now what do you think of
me She put her hands on her hips revealed a glimpse of the smallest
foot in Simla and hummed Just look at thatjust look at this And
then youll see Im not amiss

Shell use exactly the same words when you meet her next time said
the Devil warningly You dowered her with any amount of vanity if
you left outExcuse me a minute Ill fetch up the rest of your
menagerie But I was looking at Mrs Hauksbee

Well she said Am I what you expected I forgot the Devil and
all his works forgot that this was not the woman I had made and
could only murmur rapturously By Jove You are a beauty Then
incautiously And you stand on your feet Good heavens said
Mrs Hauksbee Would you at my time of life have me stand on my
head She folded her arms and looked me up and down I was grinning
imbecilelythe woman was so alive Talk I said absently I want to
hear you talk I am not used to being spoken to like a coolie she
replied Never mind I said that may be for outsiders but I made
you and Ive a right

You have a right You made me My dear sir if I didnt know that we
should bore each other so inextinguishably hereafter I should read
you an hours lecture this instant You made me I suppose you will
have the audacity to pretend that you understand methat you ever
understood me Oh man manfoolish man If you only knew

Is that the person who thinks he understands us Loo drawled a voice
at her elbow The Devil had returned with a cloud of witnesses and it
was Mrs Mallowe who was speaking

Ive touched em all up said the Devil in an aside You couldnt
stand em raw But dont run away with the notion that they are your
work I show you what they ought to be You must find out for yourself
how to make em so

Am I allowed to remodel the batchup above I asked anxiously

Litera scripta manet Thats in the Delectus and Eternity He
turned round to the semicircle of Characters Ladies and gentlemen
who are all a great deal better than you should be by virtue of my
power let me introduce you to your maker If you have anything to say
to him you can say it

What insolence said Mrs Hauksbee between her teeth This isnt
a Peterhoff drawingroom I havent the slightest intention of being
leveed by this person Polly come here and well watch the animals
go by She and Mrs Mallowe stood at my side I turned crimson with
shame for it is an awful thing to see ones Characters in the solid

Wal said Gilead P Beck as he passed I would not be you at this
precise moment of time not for all the ile in the univarsal airth
No sirr I thought my dinnerparty was soulshatterin but its
mushmush and milkto your circus Let the good work go on

I turned to the company and saw that they were men and women standing
upon their feet as folks should stand Again I forgot the Devil who
stood apart and sneered From the distant door of entry I could hear
the whistle of arriving souls from the semidarkness at the end of
the hall came the thunderous roar of the Furnace of First Edition
and everywhere the restless crowds of Characters muttered and rustled
like windblown autumn leaves But I looked upon my own people and was
perfectly content as man could be

I have seen you study a new dress with just such an expression of
idiotic beatitude whispered Mrs Mallowe to Mrs Hauksbee Hush
said the latter He thinks he understands Then to me Please trot
them out Eternity is long enough in all conscience but that is no
reason for wasting it Proceed or shall I call them up Mrs
Vansuythen Mr Boult Mrs Boult Captain Kurrel and the Major The
European population in Kashima in the Dosehri hills the actors in the
Wayside Comedy moved towards me and I saw with delight that they were
human So you wrote about us said Mrs Boult About my confession
to my husband and my hatred of that Vansuythen woman Did you think
that you understood Are all men such fools That woman is bad
form said Mrs Hauksbee but she speaks the truth I wonder what
these soldiers have to say Gunner Barnabas and Private Shacklock
stopped saluted and hoped I would take no offence if they gave it as
their opinion that I had not got them down quite right I gasped

A spurred Hussar succeeded his wife on his arm It was Captain
Gadsby and Minnie and close behind them swaggered Jack Mafflin the
BrigadierGeneral in his arms Had the cheek to try to describe our
life had you said Gadsby carelessly Hahmm Spose he understood
Minnie Mrs Gadsby raised her face to her husband and murmured
Im sure he didnt Pip while Poor Dear Mamma still in her
ridinghabit hissed Im sure he didnt understand me And these
also went their way

One after another they filed byTrewinnard the pet of his Department
Otis Yeere lean and lanthornjawed Crook ONeil and Bobby Wick arm in
arm Janki Meah the blind miner in the Jimahari coal fields Afzul
Khan the policeman the murderous Pathan horsedealer Durga Dass the
bunnia Boh Da Thone the dacoit Dana Da weaver of false magic the
Leander of the Barhwi ford Peg Barney drunk as a coot Mrs Delville
the dowd Dinah Shadd large redcheeked and resolute Simmons Slane
and Losson Georgie Porgie and his Burmese helpmate a shadow in a high
collar who was all that I had ever indicated of the Hawley Boythe
nameless men and women who had trod the Hill of Illusion and lived in
the Tents of Kedar and last His Majesty the King

Each one in passing told me the same tale and the burden thereof was
You did not understand My heart turned sick within me Wheres Wee
Willie Winkie I shouted Little children dont lie

A clatter of ponys feet followed and the child appeared habited as
on the day he rode into Afghan territory to warn Coppys love against
the bad men Ive been playing he sobbed playing on ve Levels
wiv Jackanapes and Lollo an he says Im only just borrowed Im
isnt borrowed Im Willie Wiinkie Veres Coppy

Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings whispered the Devil who
had drawn nearer You know the rest of the proverb Dont look as if
you were going to be shot in the morning Here are the last of your
gang

I turned despairingly to the Three Musketeers dearest of all my
children to meto Privates Mulvaney Ortheris and Learoyd Surely the
Three would not turn against me as the others had done I shook hands
with Mulvaney Terence how goes Are you going to make fun of me
too Tis not for me to make fun av you sorr said the Irishman
knowin as I du know fwat good friends weve been for the matter av
three years

Fower said Ortheris twas in the Helanthami barricks H block we
was become acquaint an eres thankin you kindly for all the beer
weve drunk twix that and now

Four ut is then said Mulvaney He an Dinah Shadd are your
friends but He stood uneasily

But what I said

Savin your presence sorr an its more than onwillin I am to be
hurtin you you did not ondersthand On my sowl an honour sorr you
did not ondersthand Come along you two

But Ortheris stayed for a moment to whisper Its Gawds own trewth
but theres this ere to think Taint the bloomin belt thats wrong
as Peg Barney sez when hes up for bein dirty on prade Taint the
bloomin belt sir its the bloomin pipeclay Ere I could seek an
explanation he had joined his companions

For a private soldier a singularly shrewd man said Mrs Hauksbee
and she repeated Ortheriss words The last drop filled my cup and I
am ashamed to say that I bade her be quiet in a wholly unjustifiable
tone I was rewarded by what would have been a notable lecture on
propriety had I not said to the Devil Change that woman to a dd
doll again Change em all back as they wereas they are Im sick of
them

Poor wretch said the Devil of Discontent very quietly They are
changed

The reproof died on Mrs Hauksbees lips and she moved away
marionettefashion Mrs Mallowe trailing after her I hastened after
the remainder of the Characters and they were changed indeedeven as
the Devil had said who kept at my side

They limped and stuttered and staggered and mouthed and staggered round
me till I could endure no more

So I am the master of this idiotic puppetshow am I I said
bitterly watching Mulvaney trying to come to attention by spasms

In saecula saeculorum said the Devil bowing his head and you
neednt kick my dear fellow because they will concern no one but
yourself by the time you whistle up to the door Stop reviling me and
uncover Heres the Master

Uncover I would have dropped on my knees had not the Devil prevented
me at sight of the portly form of Maitre Franois Rabelais some
time Cur of Meudon He wore a smokestained apron of the colours
of Gargantua I made a sign which was duly returned An Entered
Apprentice in difficulties with his rough ashlar Worshipful Sir
explained the Devil I was too angry to speak

Said the Master rubbing his chin Are those things yours Even so
Worshipful Sir I muttered praying inwardly that the Characters would
at least keep quiet while the Master was near He touched one or two
thoughtfully put his hand upon my shoulder and started By the Great
Bells of Notre Dame you are in the fleshthe warm fleshthe flesh I
quitted so longah so long And you fret and behave unseemly because
of these shadows Listen now I even I would give my Three Panurge
Gargantua and Pantagruel for one little hour of the life that is in
you And I am the Master

But the words gave me no comfort I could hear Mrs Mallowes joints
crackingor it might have been merely her stays

Worshipful Sir he will not believe that said the Devil Who live
by shadows lust for shadows Tell him something more to his need

The Master grunted contemptuously And he is flesh and blood Know
this then The First Law is to make them stand upon their feet and
the Second is to make them stand upon their feet and the Third is to
make them stand upon their feet But for all that Trajan is a fisher
of frogs He passed on and I could hear him say to himself One
hourone minuteof life in the flesh and I would sell the Great
Perhaps thrice over

Well said the Devil youve made the Master angry seen about all
there is to be seen except the Furnace of First Edition and as the
Master is in charge of that I should avoid it Now youd better go
You know what you ought to do

I dont need all Hell

Pardon me Better men than you have called this Paradise

All Hell I said and the Master to tell me what I knew before
What I want to know is how Go and find out said the Devil We
turned to the door and I was aware that my Characters had grouped
themselves at the exit They are going to give you an ovation Think
o that now said the Devil I shuddered and dropped my eyes while
oneandfifty voices broke into a wailing song whereof the words so
far as I recollect ran

 But we brought forth and reared in hours
   Of change alarm surprise
 What shelter to grow ripe is ours
   What leisure to grow wise

I ran the gauntlet narrowly missed collision with an impetuous soul I
hoped he liked his Characters when he met them and flung free into
the night where I should have knocked my head against the stars But
the Devil caught me

                                   

The brainfever bird was fluting across the grey dewy lawn and the
punkah had stopped again Go to Jehannum and get another man to
pull I said drowsily Exactly said a voice from the inkpot

Now the proof that this story is absolutely true lies in the fact that
there will be no other to follow it

Professor Michael S Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenbergtm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone For forty years he produced and
distributed Project Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support

Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the US unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility wwwgutenbergorg

Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to
