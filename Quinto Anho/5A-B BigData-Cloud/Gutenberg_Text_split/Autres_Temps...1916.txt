I

Mrs Lidcote as the huge menacing mass of New York defined itself far
off across the waters shrank back into her corner of the deck and sat
listening with a kind of unreasoning terror to the steady onward drive
of the screws

She had set out on the voyage quietly enoughin what she called her
reasonable moodbut the week at sea had given her too much time to
think of things and had left her too long alone with the past

When she was alone it was always the past that occupied her She
couldnt get away from it and she didnt any longer care to During
her long years of exile she had made her terms with it had learned
to accept the fact that it would always be there huge obstructing
encumbering bigger and more dominant than anything the future could
ever conjure up And at any rate she was sure of it she understood
it knew how to reckon with it she had learned to screen and manage and
protect it as one does an afflicted member of ones family

There had never been any danger of her being allowed to forget the past
It looked out at her from the face of every acquaintance it appeared
suddenly in the eyes of strangers when a word enlightened them Yes
the Mrs Lidcote dont you know It had sprung at her the first day
out when across the diningroom from the captains table she had
seen Mrs Lorin Boulgers revolving eyeglass pause and the eye behind
it grow as blank as a dropped blind The next day of course the
captain had asked You know your ambassadress Mrs Boulger and she
had replied that No she seldom left Florence and hadnt been to Rome
for more than a day since the Boulgers had been sent to Italy She was
so used to these phrases that it cost her no effort to repeat them And
the captain had promptly changed the subject

No she didnt as a rule mind the past because she was used to it and
understood it It was a great concrete fact in her path that she had to
walk around every time she moved in any direction But now in the
light of the unhappy event that had summoned her from Italythe sudden
unanticipated news of her daughters divorce from Horace Pursh and
remarriage with Wilbour Barkleythe past her own poor miserable past
started up at her with eyes of accusation became to her disordered
fancy like the afflicted relative suddenly breaking away from nurses
and keepers and publicly parading the horror and misery she had all the
long years so patiently screened and secluded

Yes there it had stood before her through the agitated weeks since the
news had comeduring her interminable journey from India where Leilas
letter had overtaken her and the feverish halt in her apartment in
Florence where she had had to stop and gather up her possessions for a
fresh startthere it had stood grinning at her with a new balefillness
which seemed to say Oh but youve got to look at me now because
Im not only your own past but Leilas present

Certainly it was a masterstroke of those archironists of the shears
and spindle to duplicate her own story in her daughters Mrs Lidcote
had always somewhat grimly fancied that having so signally failed to
be of use to Leila in other ways she would at least serve her as a
warning She had even abstained from defending herself from making
the best of her case had stoically refused to plead extenuating
circumstances lest Leilas impulsive sympathy should lead to deductions
that might react disastrously on her own life And now that very thing
had happened and Mrs Lidcote could hear the whole of New York saying
with one voice Yes Leilas done just what her mother did With such
an example what could you expect

Yet if she had been an example poor woman she had been an awful one
she had been she would have supposed of more use as a deterrent than
a hundred blameless mothers as incentives For how could any one who
had seen anything of her life in the last eighteen years have had the
courage to repeat so disastrous an experiment

Well logic in such cases didnt count example didnt count nothing
probably counted but having the same impulses in the blood and that was
the dark inheritance she had bestowed upon her daughter Leila hadnt
consciously copied her she had simply taken after her had been a
projection of her own longpast rebellion

Mrs Lidcote had deplored when she started that the Utopia was a
slow steamer and would take eight full days to bring her to her unhappy
daughter but now as the moment of reunion approached she would
willingly have turned the boat about and fled back to the high seas It
was not only because she felt still so unprepared to face what New York
had in store for her but because she needed more time to dispose of
what the Utopia had already given her The past was bad enough
but the present and future were worse because they were less
comprehensible and because as she grew older surprises and
inconsequences troubled her more than the worst certainties

There was Mrs Boulger for instance In the light or rather the
darkness of new developments it might really be that Mrs Boulger
had not meant to cut her but had simply failed to recognize her
Mrs Lidcote had arrived at this hypothesis simply by listening to the
conversation of the persons sitting next to her on decktwo lively
young women with the latest Paris hats on their heads and the latest
New York ideas in them These ladies as to whom it would have been
impossible for a person with Mrs Lidcotes oldfashioned categories to
determine whether they were married or unmarried nice or horrid or
any one or other of the definite things which young women in her
youth and her society were conveniently assumed to be had revealed
a familiarity with the world of New York that again according to Mrs
Lidcotes traditions should have implied a recognized place in it But
in the present fluid state of manners what did anything imply except
what their hats impliedthat no one could tell what was coming next

They seemed at any rate to frequent a group of idle and opulent people
who executed the same gestures and revolved on the same pivots as Mrs
Lidcotes daughter and her friends their Coras Matties and Mabels
seemed at any moment likely to reveal familiar patronymics and once
one of the speakers summing up a discussion of which Mrs Lidcote had
missed the beginning had affirmed with headlong confidence Leila Oh
Leilas all right

Could it be her Leila the mother had wondered with a sharp thrill of
apprehension If only they would mention surnames But their talk leaped
elliptically from allusion to allusion their unfinished sentences
dangled over bottomless pits of conjecture and they gave their
bewildered hearer the impression not so much of talking only of their
intimates as of being intimate with every one alive

Her old friend Franklin Ide could have told her perhaps but here was
the last day of the voyage and she hadnt yet found courage to ask him
Great as had been the joy of discovering his name on the passengerlist
and seeing his friendly bearded face in the throng against the taffrail
at Cherbourg she had as yet said nothing to him except when they had
met Of course Im going out to Leila

She had said nothing to Franklin Ide because she had always
instinctively shrunk from taking him into her confidence She was sure
he felt sorry for her sorrier perhaps than any one had ever felt
but he had always paid her the supreme tribute of not showing it His
attitude allowed her to imagine that compassion was not the basis of his
feeling for her and it was part of her joy in his friendship that it
was the one relation seemingly unconditioned by her state the only one
in which she could think and feel and behave like any other woman

Now however as the problem of New York loomed nearer she began to
regret that she had not spoken had not at least questioned him about
the hints she had gathered on the way He did not know the two ladies
next to her he did not even as it chanced know Mrs Lorin Boulger
but he knew New York and New York was the sphinx whose riddle she must
read or perish

Almost as the thought passed through her mind his stooping shoulders
and grizzled head detached themselves against the blaze of light in the
west and he sauntered down the empty deck and dropped into the chair at
her side

Youre expecting the Barkleys to meet you I suppose he asked

It was the first time she had heard any one pronounce her daughters
new name and it occurred to her that her friend who was shy and
inarticulate had been trying to say it all the way over and had at last
shot it out at her only because he felt it must be now or never

I dont know I cabled of course But I believe shes attheyre
athis place somewhere

Oh Barkleys yes near Lenox isnt it But shes sure to come to
town to meet you

He said it so easily and naturally that her own constraint was relieved
and suddenly before she knew what she meant to do she had burst out
She may dislike the idea of seeing people

Ide whose absent shortsighted gaze had been fixed on the slowly
gliding water turned in his seat to stare at his companion

Who Leila he said with an incredulous laugh

Mrs Lidcote flushed to her faded hair and grew pale again It took
me a long timeto get used to it she said

His look grew gently commiserating I think youll find he paused
for a wordthat things are different nowaltogether easier

Thats what Ive been wonderingever since we started She was
determined now to speak She moved nearer so that their arms touched
and she could drop her voice to a murmur You see it all came on me in
a flash My going off to India and Siam on that long trip kept me
away from letters for weeks at a time and she didnt want to tell me
beforehandoh I understand that poor child You know how good shes
always been to me how shes tried to spare me And she knew of course
what a state of horror Id be in She knew Id rush off to her at once
and try to stop it So she never gave me a hint of anything and she
even managed to muzzle Susy Suffernyou know Susy is the one of the
family who keeps me informed about things at home I dont yet see how
she prevented Susys telling me but she did And her first letter the
one I got up at Bangkok simply said the thing was overthe divorce I
meanand that the very next day shedwell I suppose there was no
use waiting and he seems to have behaved as well as possible to have
wanted to marry her as much as

Who Barkley he helped her out I should say so Why what do you
suppose He interrupted himself Hell be devoted to her I assure
you

Oh of course Im sure he will Hes written mereally beautifully
But its a terrible strain on a mans devotion Im not sure that Leila
realizes

Ide sounded again his little reassuring laugh Im not sure that you
realize Theyre all right

It was the very phrase that the young lady in the next seat had applied
to the unknown Leila and its recurrence on Ides lips flushed Mrs
Lidcote with fresh courage

I wish I knew just what you mean The two young women next to methe
ones with the wonderful hatshave been talking in the same way

What About Leila

About a Leila I fancied it might be mine And about society in
general All their friends seem to be divorced some of them seem
to announce their engagements before they get their decree One of
themher name was Mabelas far as I could make out her husband
found out that she meant to divorce him by noticing that she wore a new
engagementring

Well you see Leila did everything regularly as the French say Ide
rejoined

Yes but are these people in society The people my neighbours talk
about

He shrugged his shoulders It would take an arbitration commission a
good many sittings to define the boundaries of society nowadays But
at any rate theyre in New York and I assure you youre not youre
farther and farther from it

But Ive been back there several times to see Leila She hesitated
and looked away from him Then she brought out slowly And Ive never
noticedthe least changeinin my own case

Oh he sounded deprecatingly and she trembled with the fear of having
gone too far But the hour was past when such scruples could restrain
her She must know where she was and where Leila was Mrs Boulger
still cuts me she brought out with an embarrassed laugh

Are you sure Youve probably cut her if not now at least in the
past And in a cut if youre not first youre nowhere Thats what keeps
up so many quarrels

The word roused Mrs Lidcote to a renewed sense of realities But the
Purshes she saidthe Purshes are so strong There are so many of
them and they all back each other up just as my husbands family did
I know what it means to have a clan against one Theyre stronger than
any number of separate friends The Purshes will never forgive Leila
for leaving Horace Why his mother opposed his marrying her because
ofof me She tried to get Leila to promise that she wouldnt see me
when they went to Europe on their honeymoon And now shell say it was
my example

Her companion vaguely stroking his beard mused a moment upon this
then he asked with seeming irrelevance What did Leila say when you
wrote that you were coming

She said it wasnt the least necessary but that Id better come
because it was the only way to convince me that it wasnt

Well then that proves shes not afraid of the Purshes

She breathed a long sigh of remembrance Oh just at first you
knowone never is

He laid his hand on hers with a gesture of intelligence and pity
Youll see youll see he said

A shadow lengthened down the deck before them and a steward stood
there proffering a Marconigram

Oh now I shall know she exclaimed

She tore the message open and then let it fall on her knees dropping
her hands on it in silence

Ides enquiry roused her Its all right

Oh quite right Perfectly She cant come but shes sending Susy
Suffern She says Susy will explain After another silence she added
with a sudden gush of bitterness As if I needed any explanation

She felt Ides hesitating glance upon her Shes in the country

Yes Prevented last moment Longing for you expecting you Love from
both Dont you see the poor darling that she couldnt face it

No I dont He waited Do you mean to go to her immediately

It will be too late to catch a train this evening but I shall take
the first tomorrow morning She considered a moment Perhaps its
better I need a talk with Susy first Shes to meet me at the dock and
Ill take her straight back to the hotel with me

As she developed this plan she had the sense that Ide was still
thoughtfully even gravely considering her When she ceased he
remained silent a moment then he said almost ceremoniously If your
talk with Miss Suffern doesnt last too late may I come and see you
when its over I shall be dining at my club and Ill call you up at
about ten if I may Im off to Chicago on business tomorrow morning
and it would be a satisfaction to know before I start that your
cousins been able to reassure you as I know she will

He spoke with a shy deliberateness that even to Mrs Lidcotes troubled
perceptions sounded a longsilenced note of feeling Perhaps the
breaking down of the barrier of reticence between them had released
unsuspected emotions in both The tone of his appeal moved her curiously
and loosened the tight strain of her fears

Oh yes comedo come she said rising The huge threat of New York
was imminent now dwarfing under long reaches of embattled masonry the
great deck she stood on and all the little specks of life it carried
One of them drifting nearer took the shape of her maid followed by
luggageladen stewards and signing to her that it was time to go below
As they descended to the main deck the throng swept her against Mrs
Lorin Boulgers shoulder and she heard the ambassadress call out to
some one over the vexed sea of hats So sorry I should have been
delighted but Ive promised to spend Sunday with some friends at
Lenox




II

Susy Sufferns explanation did not end till after ten oclock and she
had just gone when Franklin Ide who complying with an old New York
tradition had caused himself to be preceded by a long white box of
roses was shown into Mrs Lidcotes sittingroom

He came forward with his shy halfhumorous smile and taking her hand
looked at her for a moment without speaking

Its all right he then pronounced

Mrs Lidcote returned his smile Its extraordinary Everythings
changed Even Susy has changed and you know the extent to which Susy
used to represent the old New York Theres no old New York left it
seems She talked in the most amazing way She snaps her fingers at the
Purshes She told meme that every woman had a right to happiness
and that selfexpression was the highest duty She accused me of
misunderstanding Leila she said my point of view was conventional
She was bursting with pride at having been in the secret and wearing
a brooch that Wilbour Barkleyd given her Franklin Ide had seated
himself in the armchair she had pushed forward for him under the
electric chandelier He threw back his head and laughed What did I
tell you

Yes but I cant believe that Susys not mistaken Poor dear she has
the habit of lost causes and she may feel that having stuck to me she
can do no less than stick to Leila

But she didntdid sheopenly defy the world for you She didnt
snap her fingers at the Lidcotes

Mrs Lidcote shook her head still smiling No It was enough to defy
my family It was doubtful at one time if they would tolerate her
seeing me and she almost had to disinfect herself after each visit I
believe that at first my sisterinlaw wouldnt let the girls come down
when Susy dined with her

Well isnt your cousins present attitude the best possible proof that
times have changed

Yes yes I know She leaned forward from her sofacorner fixing her
eyes on his thin kindly face which gleamed on her indistinctly
through her tears If its true itsits dazzling She says Leilas
perfectly happy Its as if an angel had gone about lifting gravestones
and the buried people walked again and the living didnt shrink from
them

Thats about it he assented

She drew a deep breath and sat looking away from him down the long
perspective of lampfringed streets over which her windows hung

I can understand how happy you must be he began at length

She turned to him impetuously Yes yes Im happy But Im lonely
toolonelier than ever I didnt take up much room in the world before
but nowwhere is there a corner for me Oh since Ive begun to confess
myself why shouldnt I go on Telling you this lifts a gravestone from
me You see before this Leila needed me She was unhappy and I knew
it and though we hardly ever talked of it I felt that in a way the
thought that Id been through the same thing and down to the dregs of
it helped her And her needing me helped me And when the news of
her marriage came my first thought was that now shed need me more
than ever that shed have no one but me to turn to Yes under all my
distress there was a fierce joy in that It was so new and wonderful
to feel again that there was one person who wouldnt be able to get on
without me And now what you and Susy tell me seems to have taken my
child from me and just at first thats all I can feel

Of course its all you feel He looked at her musingly Why didnt
Leila come to meet you

That was really my fault You see Id cabled that I was not sure of
being able to get off on the Utopia and apparently my second cable
was delayed and when she received it shed already asked some people
over Sundayone or two of her old friends Susy says Im so glad they
should have wanted to go to her at once but naturally Id rather have
been alone with her

You still mean to go then

Oh I must Susy wanted to drag me off to Ridgefield with her over
Sunday and Leila sent me word that of course I might go if I wanted
to and that I was not to think of her but I know how disappointed she
would be Susy said she was afraid I might be upset at her having people
to stay and that if I minded she wouldnt urge me to come But if
they dont mind why should I And of course if theyre willing to go
to Leila it must mean

Of course Im glad you recognize that Franklin Ide exclaimed
abruptly He stood up and went over to her taking her hand with one of
his quick gestures Theres something I want to say to you he began


The next morning in the train through all the other contending
thoughts in Mrs Lidcotes mind there ran the warm undercurrent of what
Franklin Ide had wanted to say to her

He had wanted she knew to say it once before when nearly eight
years earlier the hazard of meeting at the end of a rainy autumn in
a deserted Swiss hotel had thrown them for a fortnight into unwonted
propinquity They had walked and talked together borrowed each others
books and newspapers spent the long chill evenings over the fire in the
dim lamplight of her little pitchpine sittingroom and she had been
wonderfully comforted by his presence and hard frozen places in her had
melted and she had known that she would be desperately sorry when he
went And then just at the end in his odd indirect way he had let her
see that it rested with her to have him stay She could still relive the
sleepless night she had given to that discovery It was preposterous of
course to think of repaying his devotion by accepting such a sacrifice
but how find reasons to convince him She could not bear to let
him think her less touched less inclined to him than she was the
generosity of his love deserved that she should repay it with the truth
Yet how let him see what she felt and yet refuse what he offered How
confess to him what had been on her lips when he made the offer Ive
seen what it did to one man and there must never never be another
The tacit ignoring of her past had been the element in which their
friendship lived and she could not suddenly to him of all men begin
to talk of herself like a guilty woman in a play Somehow in the end
she had managed it had averted a direct explanation had made him
understand that her life was over that she existed only for her
daughter and that a more definite word from him would have been almost
a breach of delicacy She was so used to be having as if her life were
over And at any rate he had taken her hint and she had been able to
spare her sensitiveness and his The next year when he came to Florence
to see her they met again in the old friendly way and that till now
had continued to be the tenor of their intimacy

And now suddenly and unexpectedly he had brought up the question
again directly this time and in such a form that she could not evade
it putting the renewal of his plea after so long an interval on the
ground that on her own showing her chief argument against it no longer
existed

You tell me Leilas happy If shes happy she doesnt need youneed
you that is in the same way as before You wanted I know to be
always in reach always free and available if she should suddenly call
you to her or take refuge with you I understood thatI respected it
I didnt urge my case because I saw it was useless You couldnt I
understood well enough have felt free to take such happiness as life
with me might give you while she was unhappy and as you imagined
with no hope of release Even then I didnt feel as you did about it I
understood better the trend of things here But ten years ago the change
hadnt really come and I had no way of convincing you that it was
coming Still I always fancied that Leila might not think her case was
closed and so I chose to think that ours wasnt either Let me go on
thinking so at any rate till youve seen her and confirmed with your
own eyes what Susy Suffern tells you




III

All through what Susy Suffern told and retold her during their
fourhours flight to the hills this plea of Ides kept coming back to
Mrs Lidcote She did not yet know what she felt as to its bearing on
her own fate but it was something on which her confused thoughts
could stay themselves amid the welter of new impressions and she was
inexpressibly glad that he had said what he had and said it at that
particular moment It helped her to hold fast to her identity in the
rush of strange names and new categories that her cousins talk poured
out on her

With the progress of the journey Miss Sufferns communications grew
more and more amazing She was like a cicerone preparing the mind of an
inexperienced traveller for the marvels about to burst on it

You wont know Leila Shes had her pearls reset Sargents to paint
her Oh and I was to tell you that she hopes you wont mind being the
least bit squeezed over Sunday The house was built by Wilbours father
you know and its rather oldfashionedonly ten spare bedrooms Of
course thats small for what they mean to do and shell show you the
new plans theyve had made Their idea is to keep the present house as a
wing She told me to explainshes so dreadfully sorry not to be able
to give you a sittingroom just at first Theyre thinking of Egypt for
next winter unless of course Wilbour gets his appointment Oh didnt
she write you about that Why he wants Borne you knowthe second
secretaryship Or rather he wanted England but Leila insisted that if
they went abroad she must be near you And of course what she says is
law Oh they quite hope theyll get it You see Horaces uncle is in
the Cabinetone of the assistant secretariesand I believe he has a
good deal of pull

Horaces uncle You mean Wilbours I suppose Mrs Lidcote
interjected with a gasp of which a fraction was given to Miss Sufferns
flippant use of the language

Wilbours No I dont I mean Horaces Theres no bad feeling between
them I assure you Since Horaces engagement was announcedyou didnt
know Horace was engaged Why hes marrying one of Bishop Thorburys
girls the redhaired one who wrote the novel that every ones talking
about This Flesh of Mine Theyre to be married in the cathedral Of
course Horace can because it was Leila whobut as I say theres
not the least feeling and Horace wrote himself to his uncle about
Wilbour

Mrs Lidcotes thoughts fled back to what she had said to Ide the day
before on the deck of the Utopia I didnt take up much room before
but now where is there a corner for me Where indeed in this crowded
topsyturvey world with its headlong changes and helterskelter
readjustments its new tolerances and indifferences and accommodations
was there room for a character fashioned by slower sterner processes and
a life broken under their inexorable pressure And then in a flash
she viewed the chaos from a new angle and order seemed to move upon the
void If the old processes were changed her case was changed with them
she too was a part of the general readjustment a tiny fragment of the
new pattern worked out in bolder freer harmonies Since her daughter had
no penalty to pay was not she herself released by the same stroke The
rich arrears of youth and joy were gone but was there not time enough
left to accumulate new stores of happiness That of course was what
Franklin Ide had felt and had meant her to feel He had seen at once
what the change in her daughters situation would make in her view of
her own It was almostwondrously enoughas if Leilas folly had been
the means of vindicating hers



Everything else for the moment faded for Mrs Lidcote in the glow of her
daughters embrace It was unnatural it was almost terrifying to find
herself standing on a strange threshold under an unknown roof in a big
hall full of pictures flowers firelight and hurrying servants and
in this spacious unfamiliar confusion to discover Leila bareheaded
laughing authoritative with a strange young man jovially echoing her
welcome and transmitting her orders but once Mrs Lidcote had her child
on her breast and her childs Its all right you old darling in her
ears every other feeling was lost in the deep sense of wellbeing that
only Leilas hug could give

The sense was still with her warming her veins and pleasantly
fluttering her heart as she went up to her room after luncheon A
little constrained by the presence of visitors and not altogether sorry
to defer for a few hours the long talk with her daughter for which she
somehow felt herself tremulously unready she had withdrawn on the plea
of fatigue to the bright luxurious bedroom into which Leila had again
and again apologized for having been obliged to squeeze her The room
was bigger and finer than any in her small apartment in Florence but it
was not the standard of affluence implied in her daughters tone about
it that chiefly struck her nor yet the finish and complexity of its
appointments It was the look it shared with the rest of the house and
with the perspective of the gardens beneath its windows of being part
of an establishmentof something solid avowed founded on sacraments
and precedents and principles There was nothing about the place or
about Leila and Wilbour that suggested either passion or peril their
relation seemed as comfortable as their furniture and as respectable as
their balance at the bank

This was in the whole confusing experience the thing that confused
Mrs Lidcote most that gave her at once the deepest feeling of security
for Leila and the strongest sense of apprehension for herself Yes
there was something oppressive in the completeness and compactness of
Leilas wellbeing Ide had been right her daughter did not need her
Leila with her first embrace had unconsciously attested the fact in
the same phrase as Ide himself and as the two young women with the hats
Its all right you old darling she had said and her mother sat
alone trying to fit herself into the new scheme of things which such a
certainty betokened

Her first distinct feeling was one of irrational resentment If such a
change was to come why had it not come sooner Here was she a woman
not yet old who had paid with the best years of her life for the theft
of the happiness that her daughters contemporaries were taking as
their due There was no sense no sequence in it She had had what she
wanted but she had had to pay too much for it She had had to pay the
last bitterest price of learning that love has a price that it is worth
so much and no more She had known the anguish of watching the man she
loved discover this first and of reading the discovery in his eyes It
was a part of her history that she had not trusted herself to think
of for a long time past she always took a big turn about that haunted
corner But now at the sight of the young man downstairs so openly and
jovially Leilas she was overwhelmed at the senseless waste of her own
adventure and wrung with the irony of perceiving that the success
or failure of the deepest human experiences may hang on a matter of
chronology

Then gradually the thought of Ide returned to her I chose to think
that our case wasnt closed he had said She had been deeply touched
by that To every one else her case had been closed so long Finis was
scrawled all over her But here was one man who had believed and waited
and what if what he believed in and waited for were coming true If
Leilas all right should really foreshadow hers

As yet of course it was impossible to tell She had fancied indeed
when she entered the drawingroom before luncheon that a toosudden
hush had fallen on the assembled group of Leilas friends on the
slender vociferous young women and the lounging golfstockinged young
men They had all received her politely with the kind of petrified
politeness that may be either a tribute to age or a protest at laxity
but to them of course she must be an old woman because she was Leilas
mother and in a society so dominated by youth the mere presence of
maturity was a constraint

One of the young girls however had presently emerged from the group
and attaching herself to Mrs Lidcote had listened to her with a
blue gaze of admiration which gave the older woman a sudden happy
consciousness of her longforgotten social graces It was agreeable to
find herself attracting this young Charlotte Wynn whose mother had been
among her closest friends and in whom something of the soberness and
softness of the earlier manners had survived But the little colloquy
broken up by the announcement of luncheon could of course result in
nothing more definite than this reminiscent emotion

No she could not yet tell how her own case was to be fitted into the
new order of things but there were more peopleolder people Leila
had put itarriving by the afternoon train and that evening at dinner
she would doubtless be able to judge She began to wonder nervously who
the newcomers might be Probably she would be spared the embarrassment
of finding old acquaintances among them but it was odd that her
daughter had mentioned no names

Leila had proposed that later in the afternoon Wilbour should take
her mother for a drive she said she wanted them to have a nice quiet
talk But Mrs Lidcote wished her talk with Leila to come first and
had moreover at luncheon caught stray allusions to an impending
tennismatch in which her soninlaw was engaged Her fatigue had been a
sufficient pretext for declining the drive and she had begged Leila to
think of her as peacefully resting in her room till such time as they
could snatch their quiet moment

Before tea then you duck Leila with a last kiss had decided and
presently Mrs Lidcote through her open window had heard the fresh
loud voices of her daughters visitors chiming across the gardens from
the tenniscourt




IV

Leila had come and gone and they had had their talk It had not lasted
as long as Mrs Lidcote wished for in the middle of it Leila had been
summoned to the telephone to receive an important message from town and
had sent word to her mother that she couldnt come back just then
as one of the young ladies had been called away unexpectedly and
arrangements had to be made for her departure But the mother and
daughter had had almost an hour together and Mrs Lidcote was happy
She had never seen Leila so tender so solicitous The only thing that
troubled her was the very excess of this solicitude the exaggerated
expression of her daughters annoyance that their first moments together
should have been marred by the presence of strangers

Not strangers to me darling since theyre friends of yours her
mother had assured her

Yes but I know your feeling you queer wild mother I know how youve
always hated people Hated people Had Leila forgotten why
And thats why I told Susy that if you preferred to go with her to
Ridgefield on Sunday I should perfectly understand and patiently wait
for our good hug But you didnt really mind them at luncheon did you
dearest

Mrs Lidcote at that had suddenly thrown a startled look at her
daughter I dont mind things of that kind any longer she had simply
answered

But that doesnt console me for having exposed you to the bother of it
for having let you come here when I ought to have ordered you off to
Ridgefield with Susy If Susy hadnt been stupid shed have made you go
there with her I hate to think of you up here all alone

Again Mrs Lidcote tried to read something more than a rather obtuse
devotion in her daughters radiant gaze Im glad to have had a rest
this afternoon dear and later

Oh yes later when all this fuss is over well more than make up for
it shant we you precious darling And at this point Leila had been
summoned to the telephone leaving Mrs Lidcote to her conjectures

These were still floating before her in cloudy uncertainty when Miss
Suffern tapped at the door

Youve come to take me down to tea Id forgotten how late it was
 Mrs Lidcote exclaimed

Miss Suffern a plump peering little woman with prim hair and a
conciliatory smile nervously adjusted the pendent bugles of her
elaborate black dress Miss Suffern was always in mourning and always
commemorating the demise of distant relatives by wearing the discarded
wardrobe of their next of kin It isnt exactly mourning she would
say but its the only stitch of black poor Julia hadand of course
George was only my mothers stepcousin

As she came forward Mrs Lidcote found herself humorously wondering
whether she were mourning Horace Purshs divorce in one of his mothers
old black satins

Oh did you mean to go down for tea Susy Suffern peered at her a
little fluttered Leila sent me up to keep you company She thought it
would be cozier for you to stay here She was afraid you were feeling
rather tired

I was but Ive had the whole afternoon to rest in And this wonderful
sofa to help me

Leila told me to tell you that shed rush up for a minute before
dinner after everybody had arrived but the train is always dreadfully
late Shes in despair at not giving you a sittingroom she wanted to
know if I thought you really minded

Of course I dont mind Its not like Leila to think I should Mrs
Lidcote drew aside to make way for the housemaid who appeared in the
doorway bearing a table spread with a bewildering variety of teacakes

Leila saw to it herself Miss Suffern murmured as the door closed
Her one idea is that you should feel happy here

It struck Mrs Lidcote as one more mark of the subverted state of
things that her daughters solicitude should find expression in the
multiplicity of sandwiches and the pipinghotness of muffins but then
everything that had happened since her arrival seemed to increase her
confusion

The note of a motorhorn down the drive gave another turn to her
thoughts Are those the new arrivals already she asked

Oh dear no they wont be here till after seven Miss Suffern
craned her head from the window to catch a glimpse of the motor It
must be Charlotte leaving

Was it the little Wynn girl who was called away in a hurry I hope its
not on account of illness

Oh no I believe there was some mistake about dates Her mother
telephoned her that she was expected at the Stepleys at Fishkill and
she had to be rushed over to Albany to catch a train

Mrs Lidcote meditated Im sorry Shes a charming young thing I
hoped I should have another talk with her this evening after dinner

Yes its too bad Miss Sufferns gaze grew vague

You do look tired you know she continued seating herself at
the teatable and preparing to dispense its delicacies You must go
straight back to your sofa and let me wait on you The excitement has
told on you more than you think and you mustnt fight against it any
longer Just stay quietly up here and let yourself go Youll have Leila
to yourself on Monday

Mrs Lidcote received the teacup which her cousin proffered but showed
no other disposition to obey her injunctions For a moment she stirred
her tea in silence then she asked Is it your idea that I should stay
quietly up here till Monday

Miss Suffern set down her cup with a gesture so sudden that it
endangered an adjacent plate of scones When she had assured herself of
the safety of the scones she looked up with a fluttered laugh Perhaps
dear by tomorrow youll be feeling differently The air here you
know

Yes I know Mrs Lidcote bent forward to help herself to a scone
Whos arriving this evening she asked

Miss Suffern frowned and peered You know my wretched head for names
Leila told mebut there are so many

So many She didnt tell me she expected a big party

Oh not big but rather outside of her little group And of course as
its the first time shes a little excited at having the older set

The older set Our contemporaries you mean

Whyyes Miss Suffern paused as if to gather herself up for a leap
The Ashton Gileses she brought out

The Ashton Gileses Really I shall be glad to see Mary Giles again It
must be eighteen years said Mrs Lidcote steadily

Yes Miss Suffern gasped precipitately refilling her cup

The Ashton Gileses and who else

Well the Sam Fresbies But the most important person of course is
Mrs Lorin Boulger

Mrs Boulger Leila didnt tell me she was coming

Didnt she I suppose she forgot everything when she saw you But the
party was got up for Mrs Boulger You see its very important that she
shouldwell take a fancy to Leila and Wilbour his being appointed
to Rome virtually depends on it And you know Leila insists on Rome in
order to be near you So she asked Mary Giles whos intimate with the
Boulgers if the visit couldnt possibly be arranged and Marys cable
caught Mrs Boulger at Cherbourg Shes to be only a fortnight in
America and getting her to come directly here was rather a triumph

Yes I see it was said Mrs Lidcote

You know shes ratherrather fussy and Mary was a little doubtful
if

If she would on account of Leila Mrs Lidcote murmured

Well yes In her official position But luckily shes a friend of the
Barkleys And finding the Gileses and Fresbies here will make it all
right The times have changed Susy Suffern indulgently summed up

Mrs Lidcote smiled Yes a few years ago it would have seemed
improbable that I should ever again be dining with Mary Giles and
Harriet Fresbie and Mrs Lorin Boulger

Miss Suffern did not at the moment seem disposed to enlarge upon this
theme and after an interval of silence Mrs Lidcote suddenly resumed
Do they know Im here by the way

The effect of her question was to produce in Miss Suffern an exaggerated
access of peering and frowning She twitched the teathings about
fingered her bugles and looking at the clock exclaimed amazedly
Mercy Is it seven already

Not that it can make any difference I suppose Mrs Lidcote
continued But did Leila tell them I was coming

Miss Suffern looked at her with pain Why you dont suppose dearest
that Leila would do anything

Mrs Lidcote went on For of course its of the first importance as
you say that Mrs Lorin Boulger should be favorably impressed in order
that Wilbour may have the best possible chance of getting Borne

I told Leila youd feel that dear You see its actually on your
accountso that they may get a post near youthat Leila invited Mrs
Boulger

Yes I see that Mrs Lidcote abruptly rising from her seat turned
her eyes to the clock But as you say its getting late Oughtnt we
to dress for dinner

Miss Suffern at the suggestion stood up also an agitated hand
among her bugles I do wish I could persuade you to stay up here this
evening Im sure Leilad be happier if you would Really youre much
too tired to come down

What nonsense Susy Mrs Lidcote spoke with a sudden sharpness her
hand stretched to the bell When do we dine At halfpast eight Then I
must really send you packing At my age it takes time to dress

Miss Suffern thus projected toward the threshold lingered there to
repeat Leilall never forgive herself if you make an effort youre not
up to But Mrs Lidcote smiled on her without answering and the icy
lightwave propelled her through the door




V

Mrs Lidcote though she had made the gesture of ringing for her maid
had not done so

When the door closed she continued to stand motionless in the middle
of her soft spacious room The fire which had been kindled at twilight
danced on the brightness of silver and mirrors and sober gilding and
the sofa toward which she had been urged by Miss Suffern heaped up
its cushions in inviting proximity to a table laden with new books and
papers She could not recall having ever been more luxuriously housed
or having ever had so strange a sense of being out alone under the
night in a windbeaten plain She sat down by the fire and thought

A knock on the door made her lift her head and she saw her daughter
on the threshold The intricate ordering of Leilas fair hair and the
flying folds of her dressinggown showed that she had interrupted her
dressing to hasten to her mother but once in the room she paused a
moment smiling uncertainly as though she had forgotten the object of
her haste

Mrs Lidcote rose to her feet Time to dress dearest Dont scold I
shant be late

To dress Leila stood before her with a puzzled look Why I thought
dearI mean I hoped youd decided just to stay here quietly and rest

Her mother smiled But Ive been resting all the afternoon

Yes butyou know you do look tired And when Susy told me just now
that you meant to make the effort

You came to stop me

I came to tell you that you neednt feel in the least obliged

Of course I understand that

There was a pause during which Leila vaguely averting herself from
her mothers scrutiny drifted toward the dressingtable and began to
disturb the symmetry of the brushes and bottles laid out on it

Do your visitors know that Im here Mrs Lidcote suddenly went on

Do theyOf coursewhy naturally Leila rejoined absorbed in
trying to turn the stopper of a saltsbottle

Then wont they think it odd if I dont appear

Oh not in the least dearest I assure you theyll all understand
 Leila laid down the bottle and turned back to her mother her face
alight with reassurance

Mrs Lidcote stood motionless her head erect her smiling eyes on her
daughters Will they think it odd if I do

Leila stopped short her lips half parted to reply As she paused the
colour stole over her bare neck swept up to her throat and burst into
flame in her cheeks Thence it sent its devastating crimson up to her
very temples to the lobes of her ears to the edges of her eyelids
beating all over her in fiery waves as if fanned by some imperceptible
wind

Mrs Lidcote silently watched the conflagration then she turned away
her eyes with a slight laugh I only meant that I was afraid it might
upset the arrangement of your dinnertable if I didnt come down If you
can assure me that it wont I believe Ill take you at your word and
go back to this irresistible sofa She paused as if waiting for her
daughter to speak then she held out her arms Run off and dress
dearest and dont have me on your mind She clasped Leila close
pressing a long kiss on the last afterglow of her subsiding blush I do
feel the least bit overdone and if it wont inconvenience you to have
me drop out of things I believe Ill basely take to my bed and stay
there till your party scatters And now run off or youll be late and
make my excuses to them all




VI

The Barkleys visitors had dispersed and Mrs Lidcote completely
restored by her two days rest found herself on the following Monday
alone with her children and Miss Suffern

There was a note of jubilation in the air for the party had gone
off so extraordinarily well and so completely as it appeared to the
satisfaction of Mrs Lorin Boulger that Wilbours early appointment
to Rome was almost to be counted on So certain did this seem that the
prospect of a prompt reunion mitigated the distress with which Leila
learned of her mothers decision to return almost immediately to
Italy No one understood this decision it seemed to Leila absolutely
unintelligible that Mrs Lidcote should not stay on with them till their
own fate was fixed and Wilbour echoed her astonishment

Why shouldnt you as Leila says wait here till we can all pack up and
go together

Mrs Lidcote smiled her gratitude with her refusal After all its not
yet sure that youll be packing up

Oh you ought to have seen Wilbour with Mrs Boulger Leila triumphed

No you ought to have seen Leila with her Leilas husband exulted

Miss Suffern enthusiastically appended I do think inviting Harriet
Fresbie was a stroke of genius

Oh well be with you soon Leila laughed So soon that its really
foolish to separate

But Mrs Lidcote held out with the quiet firmness which her daughter
knew it was useless to oppose After her long months in India it was
really imperative she declared that she should get back to Florence
and see what was happening to her little place there and she had been
so comfortable on the Utopia that she had a fancy to return by the
same ship There was nothing for it therefore but to acquiesce in her
decision and keep her with them till the afternoon before the day of
the Utopias sailing This arrangement fitted in with certain projects
which during her two days seclusion Mrs Lidcote had silently
matured It had become to her of the first importance to get away as
soon as she could and the little place in Florence which held her
past in every fold of its curtains and between every page of its books
seemed now to her the one spot where that past would be endurable to
look upon

She was not unhappy during the intervening days The sight of Leilas
wellbeing the sense of Leilas tenderness were after all what she
had come for and of these she had had full measure Leila had never
been happier or more tender and the contemplation of her bliss and the
enjoyment of her affection were an absorbing occupation for her mother
But they were also a sharp strain on certain overtightened chords and
Mrs Lidcote when at last she found herself alone in the New York hotel
to which she had returned the night before embarking had the feeling
that she had just escaped with her life from the clutch of a giant hand

She had refused to let her daughter come to town with her she had even
rejected Susy Sufferns company She wanted no viaticum but that of her
own thoughts and she let these come to her without shrinking from them
as she sat in the same highhung sittingroom in which just a week
before she and Franklin Ide had had their memorable talk

She had promised her friend to let him hear from her but she had not
kept her promise She knew that he had probably come back from Chicago
and that if he learned of her sudden decision to return to Italy it
would be impossible for her not to see him before sailing and as she
wished above all things not to see him she had kept silent intending to
send him a letter from the steamer

There was no reason why she should wait till then to write it The
actual moment was more favorable and the task though not agreeable
would at least bridge over an hour of her lonely evening She went up
to the writingtable drew out a sheet of paper and began to write his
name And as she did so the door opened and he came in

The words she met him with were the last she could have imagined herself
saying when they had parted How in the world did you know that I was
here

He caught her meaning in a flash You didnt want me to then He
stood looking at her I suppose I ought to have taken your silence as
meaning that But I happened to meet Mrs Wynn who is stopping here
and she asked me to dine with her and Charlotte and Charlottes
young man They told me theyd seen you arriving this afternoon and I
couldnt help coming up

There was a pause between them which Mrs Lidcote at last surprisingly
broke with the exclamation Ah she did recognize me then

Recognize you He stared Why

Oh I saw she did though she never moved an eyelid I saw it by
Charlottes blush The child has the prettiest blush I saw that her
mother wouldnt let her speak to me

Ide put down his hat with an impatient laugh Hasnt Leila cured you of
your delusions

She looked at him intently Then you dont think Margaret Wynn meant to
cut me

I think your ideas are absurd

She paused for a perceptible moment without taking this up then she
said at a tangent Im sailing tomorrow early I meant to write to
youtheres the letter Id begun

Ide followed her gesture and then turned his eyes back to her face
You didnt mean to see me then or even to let me know that you were
going till youd left

I felt it would be easier to explain to you in a letter

What in Gods name is there to explain She made no reply and he
pressed on It cant be that youre worried about Leila for Charlotte
Wynn told me shed been there last week and there was a big
party arriving when she left Fresbies and Gileses and Mrs Lorin
Boulgerall the board of examiners If Leila has passed that shes
got her degree

Mrs Lidcote had dropped down into a corner of the sofa where she had
sat during their talk of the week before I was stupid she began
abruptly I ought to have gone to Ridgefield with Susy I didnt see
till afterward that I was expected to

You were expected to

Yes Oh it wasnt Leilas fault She sufferedpoor darling she was
distracted But shed asked her party before she knew I was arriving

Oh as to that Ide drew a deep breath of relief I can understand
that it must have been a disappointment not to have you to herself just
at first But after all you were among old friends or their children
the Gileses and Fresbiesand little Charlotte Wynn He paused a moment
before the last name and scrutinized her hesitatingly Even if they
came at the wrong time you must have been glad to see them all at
Leilas

She gave him back his look with a faint smile I didnt see them

You didnt see them

No That is excepting little Charlotte Wynn That child is exquisite
We had a talk before luncheon the day I arrived But when her mother
found out that I was staying in the house she telephoned her to leave
immediately and so I didnt see her again

The colour rushed to Ides sallow face I dont know where you get such
ideas

She pursued as if she had not heard him Oh and I saw Mary Giles for
a minute too Susy Suffern brought her up to my room the last evening
after dinner when all the others were at bridge She meant it
kindlybut it wasnt much use

But what were you doing in your room in the evening after dinner

Why you see when I found out my mistake in cominghow embarrassing
it was for Leila I meanI simply told her I was very tired and
preferred to stay upstairs till the party was over

Ide with a groan struck his hand against the arm of his chair I
wonder how much of all this you simply imagined

I didnt imagine the fact of Harriet Fresbies not even asking if
she might see me when she knew I was in the house Nor of Mary Giless
getting Susy at the eleventh hour to smuggle her up to my room when
the others wouldnt know where shed gone nor poor Leilas ghastly fear
lest Mrs Lorin Boulger for whom the party was given should guess I
was in the house and prevent her husbands giving Wilbour the second
secretaryship because shed been obliged to spend a night under the same
roof with his motherinlaw

Ide continued to drum on his chairarm with exasperated fingers You
dont know that any of the acts you describe are due to the causes you
suppose

Mrs Lidcote paused before replying as if honestly trying to measure
the weight of this argument Then she said in a low tone I know that
Leila was in an agony lest I should come down to dinner the first night
And it was for me she was afraid not for herself Leila is never afraid
for herself

But the conclusions you draw are simply preposterous There are
narrowminded women everywhere but the women who were at Leilas knew
perfectly well that their going there would give her a sort of social
sanction and if they were willing that she should have it why on earth
should they want to withhold it from you

Thats what I told myself a week ago in this very room after my first
talk with Susy Suffern She lifted a misty smile to his anxious eyes
Thats why I listened to what you said to me the same evening and why
your arguments half convinced me and made me think that what had
been possible for Leila might not be impossible for me If the new
dispensation had come why not for me as well as for the others I cant
tell you the flight my imagination took

Franklin Ide rose from his seat and crossed the room to a chair near her
sofacorner All I cared about was that it seemedfor the momentto
be carrying you toward me he said

I cared about that too Thats why I meant to go away without seeing
you They gave each other grave look for look Because you see I
was mistaken she went on We were both mistaken You say its
preposterous that the women who didnt object to accepting Leilas
hospitality should have objected to meeting me under her roof And so it
is but I begin to understand why Its simply that society is much too
busy to revise its own judgments Probably no one in the house with me
stopped to consider that my case and Leilas were identical They only
remembered that Id done something which at the time I did it was
condemned by society My case has been passed on and classified Im the
woman who has been cut for nearly twenty years The older people have
half forgotten why and the younger ones have never really known its
simply become a tradition to cut me And traditions that have lost their
meaning are the hardest of all to destroy

Ide sat motionless while she spoke As she ended he stood up with
a short laugh and walked across the room to the window Outside the
immense black prospect of New York strung with its myriad lines of
light stretched away into the smoky edges of the night He showed it to
her with a gesture

What do you suppose such words as youve been usingsociety
tradition and the restmean to all the life out there

She came and stood by him in the window Less than nothing of course
But you and I are not out there Were shut up in a little tight round
of habit and association just as were shut up in this room Remember
I thought Id got out of it once but what really happened was that the
other people went out and left me in the same little room The only
difference was that I was there alone Oh Ive made it habitable now
Im used to it but Ive lost any illusions I may have had as to an
angels opening the door

Ide again laughed impatiently Well if the door wont open why not
let another prisoner in At least it would be less of a solitude

She turned from the dark window back into the vividly lighted room

It would be more of a prison You forget that I know all about that
Were all imprisoned of courseall of us middling people who dont
carry our freedom in our brains But weve accommodated ourselves to our
different cells and if were moved suddenly into new ones were likely
to find a stone wall where we thought there was thin air and to knock
ourselves senseless against it I saw a man do that once

Ide leaning with folded arms against the windowframe watched her in
silence as she moved restlessly about the room gathering together
some scattered books and tossing a handful of torn letters into the
paperbasket When she ceased he rejoined All you say is based on
preconceived theories Why didnt you put them to the test by coming
down to meet your old friends Dont you see the inference they would
naturally draw from your hiding yourself when they arrived It looked as
though you were afraid of themor as though you hadnt forgiven them
Either way you put them in the wrong instead of waiting to let them put
you in the right If Leila had buried herself in a desert do you suppose
society would have gone to fetch her out You say you were afraid for
Leila and that she was afraid for you Dont you see what all these
complications of feeling mean Simply that you were too nervous at the
moment to let things happen naturally just as youre too nervous now
to judge them rationally He paused and turned his eyes to her face
Dont try to just yet Give yourself a little more time Give me a
little more time Ive always known it would take time

He moved nearer and she let him have her hand

With the grave kindness of his face so close above her she felt like a
child roused out of frightened dreams and finding a light in the room

Perhaps youre right she heard herself begin then something within
her clutched her back and her hand fell away from him

I know Im right trust me he urged Well talk of this in Florence
soon

She stood before him feeling with despair his kindness his patience
and his unreality Everything he said seemed like a painted gauze let
down between herself and the real facts of life and a sudden desire
seized her to tear the gauze into shreds

She drew back and looked at him with a smile of superficial reassurance
You are rightabout not talking any longer now Im nervous and
tired and it would do no good I brood over things too much As you
say I must try not to shrink from people She turned away and glanced
at the clock Why its only ten If I send you off I shall begin
to brood again and if you stay we shall go on talking about the same
thing Why shouldnt we go down and see Margaret Wynn for half an hour

She spoke lightly and rapidly her brilliant eyes on his face As she
watched him she saw it change as if her smile had thrown a too vivid
light upon it

Oh nonot tonight he exclaimed

Not tonight Why what other night have I when Im off at
dawn Besides I want to show you at once that I mean to be more
sensiblethat Im not going to be afraid of people any more And I
should really like another glimpse of little Charlotte He stood
before her his hand in his beard with the gesture he had in moments of
perplexity Come she ordered him gaily turning to the door

He followed her and laid his hand on her arm Dont you thinkhadnt
you better let me go first and see They told me theyd had a tiring day
at the dressmakers I daresay they have gone to bed

But you said theyd a young man of Charlottes dining with them Surely
he wouldnt have left by ten At any rate Ill go down with you and
see It takes so long if one sends a servant first She put him gently
aside and then paused as a new thought struck her Or wait my maids
in the next room Ill tell her to go and ask if Margaret will receive
me Yes thats much the best way

She turned back and went toward the door that led to her bedroom but
before she could open it she felt Ides quick touch again

I believeI remember nowCharlottes young man was suggesting that
they should all go outto a musichall or something of the sort Im
sureIm positively sure that you wont find them

Her hand dropped from the door his dropped from her arm and as they
drew back and faced each other she saw the blood rise slowly through his
sallow skin redden his neck and ears encroach upon the edges of his
beard and settle in dull patches under his kind troubled eyes She had
seen the same blush on another face and the same impulse of compassion
she had then felt made her turn her gaze away again

A knock on the door broke the silence and a porter put his head into
the room

Its only just to know how many pieces therell be to go down to the
steamer in the morning

With the words she felt that the veil of painted gauze was torn in
tatters and that she was moving again among the grim edges of reality

Oh dear she exclaimed I never can remember Wait a minute I
shall have to ask my maid

She opened her bedroom door and called out Annette
