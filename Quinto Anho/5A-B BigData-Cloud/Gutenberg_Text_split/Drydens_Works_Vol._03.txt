  SIR MARTIN MARALL
  OR THE
  FEIGNED INNOCENCE

  A
  COMEDY




SIR MARTIN MARALL


Sir Martin MarAll is imitated from the French of Moliere
nor even with that qualification is it entirely the work of
Dryden William Cavendish Duke of Newcastle renowned for
his loyalty and gallantry during the civil wars whether in compliance
with the general custom amongst the men of wit and honour
at the court of Charles or in order to place himself upon a
level with that voluminous authoress his Duchess thought fit to
compose several plays Amongst other lucubrations he translated
Molieres LEtourdi and presented it to our author by
whom it was adapted for the stage From respect to his Grace
it was published anonymously until  when it appeared with
Drydens name The noble Duke being far more eminent as a soldier
and an equestrian than as an author it may be readily allowed
that what is diverting in the piece has been inserted by our
author Upon the stage indeed the repeated and incorrigible
blunders of Sir Martin must have appeared very diverting since
the play ran for no less than thirtythree nights and was four
times acted at court Nokes who acted this unfortunate coxcomb
with inimitable humour is said to have contributed much
to this uncommon success Molieres play is followed with considerable
exactness allowing for such variations as the change of
the scene from Paris to London appeared naturally to demand
One remarkable difference occurs in the conclusion Coelie is in
the original at length united to her inconsiderate and blundering
admirer Mrs Millisent the corresponding character in Sir Martin
Marall rewards with her hand and fortune the ingenious
Warner who has all along laboured to gain her for his master
The alternative was a little embarrassing but the decorum of the
French stage would not have permitted the union of a lady with
an intriguing domestic nor would an English audience have been
less shocked with seeing her bestowed on a fool Besides Sir
Martin Marall is a more contemptible character than Lelie who
is less conceited and foolish than thoughtless and inconsequential
But although the character of a menial was not quite so low in
the th as in the th centuryfor pages and the higher class
of attendants in a noblemans family were often men of some
birthyet there is much grossness in the conduct of the lady
who in pure admiration of wit marries a man who never thought
of her

LAmant Indiscret of Quinault another French play has
also been consulted by Dryden in furbishing forth the Duke of
Newcastles labours In that part of the play which occasions
its second title of The feigned Innocence the reader will hardly
find wit enough to counterbalance the want of delicacy

Sir Martin Marall was performed by the Duke of Yorks servants
probably at the desire of the Duke of Newcastle as Dryden
was engaged to write for the other house It seems to have
been acted in  and was published but without the authors
name in 




PROLOGUE


  Fools which each man meets in his dish each day
  Are yet the great regalios of a play
  In which to poets you but just appear
  To prize that highest which cost them so dear
  Fops in the town more easily will pass
  One story makes a statutable ass
  But such in plays must be much thicker sown
  Like yolks of eggs a dozen beat to one
  Observing poets all their walks invade
  As men watch woodcocks gliding through a glade
  And when they have enough for comedy
  They stow their several bodies in a pye
  The poets but the cook to fashion it
  For gallants you yourselves have found the wit
  To bid you welcome would your bounty wrong
  None welcome those who bring their cheer along

SCENECovent Garden

Footnote A Swashbuckler seems to have been a title for those who
retained the old blunt manners of Queen Elizabeths time when sword and
buckler were the common weapons Of old when Englishmen were fenced
with bucklers as with a rampier nothing was more common with them
than to fight about taking the right or left hand on the wall or upon
any unpleasing countenance clashing of swords was then daily music in
every street MORYSONS Itinerary Part III Book ivThe buckler
was disused in the latter end of Queen Elizabeths reign but those who
affected the oldfashioned blunt boisterous manners common when that
ancient weapon was used in brawls were like old Moody in the play
still termed Swashbucklers




SIR MARTIN MARALL




ACT I SCENE I


Enter WARNER solus

Warn Where the devil is this master of mine he is ever out of the
way when he should do himself good This tis to serve a coxcomb one
that has no more brains than just those I carry for him Well of all
fops commend me to him for the greatest hes so opinioned of his own
abilities that he is ever designing somewhat and yet he sows his
stratagems so shallow that every daw can pick them up From a plotting
fool the Lord deliver me Here he comesO it seems his cousins with
him then it is not so bad as I imagined

Enter Sir MARTIN MARALL and Lady DUPE

L Dupe I think twas well contrived for your access to lodge her in
the same house with you

Sir Mart Tis pretty well I must confess

Warn Had he plotted it himself it had been admirable
                                                               Aside

L Dupe For when her father Moody writ to me to take him lodgings I
so ordered it the choice seemed his not mine

Sir Mart I have hit of a thing myself sometimes when wiser heads
have missed it but that might be mere luck

L Dupe Fortune does more than wisdom

Sir Mart Nay for that you shall excuse me I will not value any
mans fortune at a rush except he have wit and parts to bear him out
But when do you expect them

L Dupe This tide will bring them from Gravesend You had best let
your man go as from me and wait them at the stairs in Durhamyard

Sir Mart Lord cousin what ado is here with your counsel As though
I could not have thought of that myself I could find in my heart not to
send him nowstay a littleI could soon find out some other way

Warn A minutes stay may lose your business

Sir Mart Well go then but you must grant if he had staid I could
have found a better wayyou grant it

L Dupe For once I will not stand with you Exit WARNER Tis a
sweet gentlewoman this Mrs Millisent if you can get her

Sir Mart Let me alone for plotting

L Dupe But by your favour sir tis not so easy her father has
already promised her and the young gentleman comes up with them I
partly know the manbut the old squire is humoursome hes stout and
plain in speech and in behaviour he loves none of the fine town tricks
of breeding but stands up for the old Elizabeth way in all things This
we must work upon

Sir Mart Sure you think you have to deal with a fool cousin

Enter Mrs CHRISTIAN

L Dupe O my dear niece I have some business with you
                                                            Whispers

Sir Mart Well madam Ill take one turn here in the Piazzas a
thousand things are hammering in this head tis a fruitful noddle
though I say it
                                                       Exit Sir MART

L Dupe Go thy ways for a most conceited foolbut to our business
cousin You are young but I am old and have had all the
loveexperience that a discreet lady ought to have and therefore let
me instruct you about the love this rich lord makes to you

Chr You know madam hes married so that we cannot work upon that
ground of matrimony

L Dupe But there are advantages enough for you if you will be wise
and follow my advice

Chr Madam my friends left me to your care therefore I will wholly
follow your counsel with secrecy and obedience

L Dupe Sweetheart it shall be the better for you another day Well
then this lord that pretends to you is crafty and false as most men
are especially in love therefore we must be subtle to meet with all
his plots and have countermines against his works to blow him up

Chr As how madam

L Dupe Why girl hell make fierce love to you but you must not
suffer him to ruffle you or steal a kiss But you must weep and sigh
and say youll tell me ont and that you will not be used so and play
the innocent just like a child and seem ignorant of all

Chr I warrant you Ill be very ignorant madam

L Dupe And be sure when he has towsed you not to appear at supper
that night that you may fright him

Chr No madam

L Dupe That he may think you have told me

Chr Ay madam

L Dupe And keep your chamber and say your head aches

Chr O most extremely madam

L Dupe And lock the door and admit of no night visits At supper
Ill ask wheres my cousin and being told you are not well Ill start
from the table to visit you desiring his lordship not to incommode
himself for I will presently wait on him again

Chr But how when you are returned madam

L Dupe Then somewhat discomposed Ill say I doubt the meazles or
smallpox will seize on you and then the girl is spoiled saying poor
thing her portion is her beauty and her virtue and often send to see
how you do by whispers in my servants ears and have those whispers of
your health returned to mine If his lordship thereupon asks how you
do I will pretend it was some other thing

Chr Right madam for that will bring him further in suspence

L Dupe A hopeful girl then will I eat nothing that night feigning
my grief for you but keep his lordship company at meal and seem to
strive to put my passion off yet shew it still by small mistakes

Chr And broken sentences

L Dupe A dainty girl and after supper visit you again with promise
to return strait to his lordship but after I am gone send an excuse
that I have given you a cordial and mean to watch that night in person
with you

Chr His lordship then will find the prologue of his trouble doubting
I have told you of his ruffling

L Dupe And more than that fearing his father should know of it and
his wife who is a termagant lady But when he finds the coast is clear
and his late ruffling known to none but you he will be drunk with joy

Chr Finding my simple innocence which will inflame him more

L Dupe Then what the lions skin has failed him in the foxs
subtlety must next supply and that is just sweetheart as I would have
it for crafty folks treaties are their advantage especially when his
passion must be satisfied at any rate and you keep shop to set the
price of love so now you see the market is your own

Chr Truly madam this is very rational and by the blessing of
heaven upon my poor endeavours I do not doubt to play my part

L Dupe My blessing and my prayers go along with thee

Enter Sir JOHN SWALLOW Mrs MILLISENT and ROSE her maid

Chr I believe madam here is the young heiress you expect and with
her he who is to marry her

L Dupe However I am Sir Martins friend I must not seem his enemy

Sir John Madam this fair young lady begs the honour to be known to
you

Mill My father made me hope it madam

L Dupe Sweet lady I believe you have brought all the freshness of
the country up to town with you
                                                         They salute

Mill I came up madam as we countrygentlewomen use at an
Easterterm to the destruction of tarts and cheesecakes to see a new
play buy a new gown take a turn in the park and so down again to
sleep with my forefathers

Sir John Rather madam you are come up to the breaking of many a
poor heart that like mine will languish for you

Chr I doubt madam you are indisposed with your voyage will you
please to see the lodgings your father has provided for you

Mill To wait upon you madam

L Dupe This is the door there is a gentleman will wait you
immediately in your lodging if he might presume on your commands
                                                        In a whisper

Mill You mean Sir Martin Marall I am glad he has entrusted his
passion with so discreet a person In a whisper Sir John let me
entreat you to stay here that my father may have intelligence where to
find us

Sir John I shall obey you madam
                                                        Exeunt women

Enter Sir MARTIN MARALL

Sir John Sir Martin Marall most happily encountered how long have
you been come to town

Sir Mart Some three days since or thereabouts But I thank God I
am very weary ont already

Sir John Why whats the matter man

Sir Mart My villainous old luck still follows me in gaming I never
throw the dice out of my hand but my gold goes after them If I go to
piquet though it be but with a novice int he will picque and
repicque and capot me twenty times together and which most mads me I
lose all my sets when I want but one of up

Sir John The pleasure of play is lost when one loses at that
unreasonable rate

Sir Mart But I have sworn not to touch either cards or dice this half
year

Sir John The oaths of losing gamesters are most minded they
forswear play as an angry servant does his mistress because he loves
her but too well

Sir Mart But I am now taken up with thoughts of another nature I am
in love sir

Sir John Thats the worst game you could have played at scarce one
woman in an hundred will play with you upon the square You venture at
more uncertainty than at a lottery For you set your heart to a whole
sex of blanks But is your mistress widow wife or maid

Sir Mart I can assure you sir mine is a maid the heiress of a
wealthy family fair to a miracle

Sir John Does she accept your service

Sir Mart I am the only person in her favour

Enter WARNER

Sir John Is she of town or country

Warn Hows this
                                                               Aside

Sir Mart She is of Kent near Canterbury

Warn What does he mean This is his rival
                                                               Aside

Sir John Near Canterbury say you I have a small estate lies
thereabouts and more concernments than one besides

Sir Mart Ill tell you then Being at Canterbury it was my fortune
once in the Cathedral church

Warn What do you mean sir to intrust this man with your affairs
thus

Sir Mart Trust him why hes a friend of mine

Warn No matter for that hark you a word sir

Sir Mart Prythee leave fooling and as I was sayingI was in the
church when I first saw this fair one

Sir John Her name sir I beseech you

Warn For heavens sake sir have a care

Sir Mart Thou art such a coxcombHer names Millisent

Warn Now the pox take you sir what do you mean

Sir John Millisent say you Thats the name of my mistress

Sir Mart Lord what luck is that now well sir it happened one of
her gloves fell down I stooped to take it up and in the stooping
made her a compliment

Warn The devil cannot hold him now will this thickskulled master of
mine tell the whole story to his rival

Sir Mart Youll say twas strange sir but at the first glance we
cast on one another both our hearts leaped within us our souls met at
our eyes and with a tickling kind of pain slid to each others breast
and in one moment settled as close and warm as if they long had been
acquainted with their lodging I followed her somewhat at a distance
because her father was with her

Warn Yet hold sir

Sir Mart Saucy rascal avoid my sight must you tutor meSo sir
not to trouble you I enquired out her fathers house without whose
knowledge I did court the daughter and both then and often since
coming to Canterbury I received many proofs of her kindness to me

Warn You had best tell him too that I am acquainted with her maid
and manage your love underhand with her

Sir Mart Well remembered ifaith I thank thee for that I had
forgot it I protest My valet de chambre whom you see here with me
grows me acquainted with her woman

Warn O the devil

Sir Mart In fine sir this maid being much in her mistresss
favour so well solicited my cause that in fine I gained from fair
mistress Millisent an assurance of her kindness and an engagement to
marry none but me

Warn Tis very well you have made a fair discovery

Sir John A most pleasant relation I assure you You are a happy man
sir but what occasion brought you now to London

Sir Mart That was in expectation to meet my mistress here she writ
me word from Canterbury she and her father shortly would be here

Sir John She and her father said you sir

Warn Tell him sir for heavens sake tell him all

Sir Mart So I will sir without your bidding Her father and she are
come up already thats the truth ont and are to lodge by my
contrivance in yon house the master of which is a cunning rascal as any
in townhim I have made my own for I lodge there

Warn You do ill sir to speak so scandalously of my landlord

Sir Mart Peace or Ill break your fools head so that by his means
I shall have free egress and regress when I please sir without her
fathers knowledge

Warn I am out of patience to hear this

Sir John Methinks you might do well sir to speak openly to her
father

Sir Mart Thank you for that ifaith in speaking to old Moody I may
soon spoil all

Warn So now he has told her fathers name tis past recovery

Sir John Is her fathers name Moody say you

Sir Mart Is he of your acquaintance

Sir John Yes sir I know him for a man who is too wise for you to
overreach I am certain he will never marry his daughter to you

Sir Mart Why theres the jest of it He shall never know it Tis
but your keeping of my counsel Ill do as much for you mun

Sir John No sir Ill give you better trouble not yourself about
this lady her affections are otherwise engaged to my knowledgehark
in your earher father hates a gamester like a devil Ill keep your
counsel for that too

Sir Mart Nay but this is not all dear Sir John

Sir John This is all I assure you Only I will make bold to seek
your mistress out another lodging
                                                       Exit Sir JOHN

Warn Your affairs are now put into an excellent posture thank your
incomparable discretion this was a stratagem my shallow wit could never
have reached to make a confident of my rival

Sir Mart I hope thou art not in earnest man Is he my rival

Warn Slife he has not found it out all this while well sir for a
quick apprehension let you alone

Sir Mart How the devil camest thou to know ont and why the devil
didst thou not tell me ont

Warn To the first of your devils I answer her maid Rose told me
ont To the second I wish a thousand devils take him that would not
hear me

Sir Mart O unparallelled misfortune

Warn O unparallelled ignorance why he left her father at the
waterside while he led the daughter to her lodging whither I directed
him so that if you had not laboured to the contrary fortune had placed
you in the same house with your mistress without the least suspicion of
your rival or of her father But tis well you have satisfied your
talkative humour I hope you have some new project of your own to set
all right again For my part I confess all my designs for you are
wholly ruined the very foundations of them are blown up

Sir Mart Prythee insult not over the destiny of a poor undone lover
I am punished enough for my indiscretion in my despair and have nothing
to hope for now but death

Warn Death is a bugword things are not brought to that extremity
Ill cast about to save all yet

Enter Lady DUPE

L Dupe O Sir Martin yonder has been such a stir within Sir John
I fear smokes your design and by all means would have the old man
remove his lodging pray God your man has not played false

Warn Like enough I have I am coxcomb sufficient to do it my master
knows that none but such a great calf as I could have done it such an
overgrown ass a selfconceited idiot as I

Sir Mart Nay Warner

Warn Pray sir let me alone What is it to you if I rail upon
myself Now could I break my own loggerhead

Sir Mart Nay sweet Warner

Warn What a good master have I and I to ruin him O beast

L Dupe Not to discourage you wholly Sir Martin this storm is
partly over

Sir Mart As how dear cousin

L Dupe When I heard Sir John complain of the landlord I took the
first hint of it and joined with him saying if he were such an one I
would have nothing to do with him In short I rattled him so well that
Sir John was the first who did desire they might be lodged with me not
knowing that I was your kinswoman

Sir Mart Pox ont now I think ont I could have found out this
myself

Warn Are you there again sir Now as I have a soul

Sir Mart Mum good Warner I did but forget myself a little I leave
myself wholly to you and my cousin get but my mistress for me and
claim whatever reward you can desire

Warn Hope of reward will diligence beget Find you the money and
Ill find the wit
                                                              Exeunt




ACT II SCENE I


Enter Lady DUPE and Mrs CHRISTIAN

Chr It happened madam just as you said it would but was he so
concerned for my feigned sickness

L Dupe So much that Moody and his daughter our new guests take
notice of the trouble but the cause was kept too close for strangers to
divine

Chr Heaven grant he be but deep enough in love and then

L Dupe And then thou shalt distil him into gold my girl Yonder he
comes Ill not be seen you know your lesson child
                                                                Exit

Chr A poor weak innocent creature as I am heaven of his mercy how I
quake and tremble I have not yet clawed off your last ill usage and
now I feel my old fit come again my ears tingle already and my back
shuts and opens ay just so it began before

Lord Nay my sweet mistress be not so unjust to suspect any new
attempt I am too penitent for my last fault so soon to sin again I
hope you did not tell it to your aunt

Chr The more fool I I did not

Lord You never shall repent your goodness to me but may not I
presume there was some little kindness in it which moved you to conceal
my crime

Chr Methought I would not have mine aunt angry with you for all this
earthly good but yet Ill never be alone with you again

Lord Pretty innocence let me sit nearer to you You do not
understand what love I bear you I vow it is so pure my souls not
sullied with one spot of sin Were you a sister or a daughter to me
with a more holy flame I could not burn

Chr Nay now you speak high words I cannot understand you

Lord The business of my life shall be but how to make your fortune
and my care and study to advance and see you settled in the world

Chr I humbly thank your lordship

Lord Thus I would sacrifice my life and fortunes and in return you
cruelly destroy me

Chr I never meant you any harm not I

Lord Then what does this white enemy so near me Touching her hand
gloved Sure tis your champion and you arm it thus to bid defiance
to me

Chr Nay fie my lord In faith you are to blame
                                               Pulling her hand away

Lord But I am for fair wars an enemy must first be searched for
privy armour ere we do engage
                                                  Pulls at her glove

Chr What does your lordship mean

Lord I fear you bear some spells and charms about you and madam
thats against the law of arms

Chr My aunt charged me not to pull off my glove for fear of
sunburning my hand

Lord She did well to keep it from your eyes but I will thus preserve
it
                                               Hugging her bare hand

Chr Why do you crush it so nay now you hurt me nayif you squeeze

Lord The devil take me if I can answer her a word all my senses are

Chr Neer stir my lord I must cry out

Lord Then I must stop your mouththis ruby for a kissthat is but

Chr This is worse and worse

Enter Lady DUPE

L Dupe My lord heaven bless me what makes your lordship here

Lord I was just wishing for you madam your niece and I have been so
laughing at the blunt humour of your countrygentleman I must go pass
an hour with him
                                                           Exit LORD

Chr You made a little too much haste I was just exchanging a kiss
for a ruby

L Dupe No harm done it will make him come on the faster Never full
gorge an hawk you mean to fly The next will be a necklace of pearl I
warrant you

Chr But what must I do next

L Dupe Tell him I grew suspicious and examined you whether he made
not love which you denied Then tell him how my maids and daughters
watch you so that you tremble when you see his lordship

Chr And that your daughters are so envious that they would raise a
false report to ruin me

L Dupe Therefore you desire his lordship as he loves you of which
you are confident henceforward to forbear his visits to you

Chr But how if he should take me at my word

L Dupe Why if the worst come to the worst he leaves you an honest
woman and theres an end ont But fear not that hold out his
messages and then hell write and that is it my bird which you must
drive it to Then all his letters will be such ecstasies such vows and
promises which you must answer short and simply yet still ply out of
them your advantages

Chr But madam hes in the house he will not write

L Dupe You foolhell write from the next chamber to you and
rather than fail send his page post with it upon a hobbyhorse Then
grant a meeting but tell me of it and Ill prevent him by my being
there hell curse me but I care not When you are alone hell urge
his lust which answer you with scorn and anger

Chr As thus ant please you madam What Does he think I will be
damnd for him Defame my family ruin my name to satisfy his pleasure

L Dupe Then he will be profane in his arguments urge natures laws
to you

Chr Byr lady and those are shrewd arguments but I am resolved Ill
stop my ears

L Dupe Then when he sees no other thing will move you hell sign a
portion to you beforehand Take hold of that and then of what you will
                                                              Exeunt

SCENE II

Enter Sir JOHN Mrs MILLISENT and ROSE

Sir John Now fair Mrs Millisent you see your chamber your father
will be busy a few minutes and in the mean time permits me the
happiness to wait on you

Mill Methinks you might have chose us better lodgings this house is
full the other we saw first was more convenient

Sir John For you perhaps but not for me You might have met a lover
there but I a rival

Mill What rival

Sir John You know Sir Martin I need not name it to you

Mill I know more men besides him

Sir John But you love none besides him Can you deny your affection
to him

Mill You have vexed me so I will not satisfy you

Sir John Then I perceive I am not likely to be so much obliged to
you as I was to him

Mill This is romanceIll not believe a word ont

Sir John Thats as you please However tis believed his wit will
not much credit your choice Madam do justice to us both pay his
ingratitude and folly with your scorn my service with your love By
this time your father stays for me I shall be discreet enough to keep
this fault of yours from him the lawyers wait for us to draw your
jointure and I would beg your pardon for my absence but that my crime
is punished in itself

Mill Could I suspect this usage from a favoured servant

Rose First hear Sir Martin ere you quite condemn him consider tis
a rival who accused him

Mill Speak not a word in his behalf Methought too Sir John called
him fool

Rose Indeed he has a rare way of acting a fool and does it so
naturally it can be scarce distinguished

Mill Nay he has wit enough thats certain

Rose How blind love is

Enter WARNER

Mill How now whats his business I wonder after such a crime if
his master has the face to send him to me

Rose How durst you venture hither If either Sir John or my old
master see you

catch you here

Warn Twenty to one I am gone before and save them a labour

Mill Ill have no whispering

Mill Your master then is innocent

Warn Why could your ladyship suspect him guilty Pray tell me do
you think him ungrateful or a fool

Mill I think him neither

Warn Take it from me you see not the depth of him But when he knows
what thoughts you harbour of him as I am faithful and must tell him I
wish he does not take some pet and leave you

Mill Thou art not mad I hope to tell him ont if thou dost Ill
be sworn Ill forswear it to him

Warn Upon condition then youll pardon me Ill see what I can do to
hold my tongue

Mill This evening in St Jamess Park Ill meet him

Mill Pray stay a little sir

Warn At the door He must pass just by me and if he sees me I
am but a dead man

Sir John Why are you thus concerned why do you hold me

Mill Only a word or two I have to tell you Tis of importance to
you

Sir John Give me leave

Mill I must not before I discover the plot to you

Sir John What plot

Mill Sir Martins servant like a rogue comes hither to tempt me
from his master to have met him

Warn At the door Now would I had a good bag of gunpowder at my
breech to ram me into some hole

Mill For my part I was so startled at the message that I shall
scarcely be myself these two days

Sir John Oh that I had the rascal I would teach him to come upon
such errands

Warn Oh for a gentle composition now An arm or leg I would give
willingly

Sir John What answer did you make the villain

Mill I overreached him clearly by a promise of an appointment of a
place I named where I never meant to come But would have had the
pleasure first to tell you how I served him

Sir John And then to chide your mean suspicion of me indeed I
wondered you should love a fool But where did you appoint to meet him

Mill In GraysInn walks

Warn By this light she has put the change upon him O sweet
womankind how I love thee for that heavenly gift of lying

Sir John For this evening I will be his mistress he shall meet
another Penelope than he suspects

Mill But stay not long away

Warn Entering Is he gone madam

Mill As far as GraysInn walks Now I have time to walk the other
way and see thy master

Warn Rather let him come hither I have laid a plot shall send his
rival far enough from watching him ere long

Mill Art thou in earnest

Warn Tis so designed fate cannot hinder it Our landlord where we
lie vexed that his lodgings should be so left by Sir John is resolved
to be revenged and I have found the way Youll see the effects ont
presently

Rose O heavens the door opens again and Sir John is returned once

Warn When you know all I shall deserve it sir I came to sound the
virtue of your mistress which I have done so cunningly I have at last
obtained the promise of a meeting But my good master whom I must
confess more generous than wise knowing you had a passion for her is
resolved to quit And sir that you may see how much he loves you sent
me in private to advise you still to have an eye upon her actions

Sir John Take this diamond for thy good news and give thy master my
acknowledgments

reckoning was wiped out

Sir Mart Then why did my landlord disguise himself to make a fool of

as a whiff of tobacco was formerly in the midst of a discourse for a
thinking while

SCENE III

Enter WARNER and ROSE


Rose A mischief upon all fools do you think your master has not done
wisely First to mistake our old mans humour then to dispraise the
plays and lastly to discover his acquaintance with my mistress My
old master has taken such a jealousy of him that he will never admit
him into his sight again

Warn Thou makest thyself a greater fool than he by being angry at
what he cannot help I have been angry with him too but these friends
have taken up the quarrel Shews gold Look you he has sent these
mediators to mitigate your wrath Here are twenty of them have made a
long voyage from Guinea to kiss your hands And when the match is made
there are an hundred more in readiness to be your humble servants

Rose Rather than fall out with you Ill take them but I confess it
troubles me to see so loyal a lover have the heart of an emperor and
yet scarce the brains of a cobler

Warn Well what device can we two beget betwixt us to separate Sir
John Swallow and thy mistress

Rose I cannot on the sudden tell but I hate him worse than foul
weather without a coach

Warn Then Ill see if my project be luckier than thine Where are the
papers concerning the jointure I have heard you speak of

Rose They lie within in three great bags some twenty reams of paper
in each bundle with six lines in a sheet But there is a little paper
where all the business lies

Warn Where is it Canst thou help me to it

Rose By good chance he gave it to my custody before he set out for
London You came in good time here it is I was carrying it to him
just now he sent for it

Warn Was there ever such a lucky rogue as I I had always a good
opinion of my wit but could never think I had so much as now I find I
have now gained an opportunity to carry away Mrs Millisent for my
master to get his mistress by means of his rival to receive all his
happiness where he could expect nothing but misery After this exploit
I will have Lilly draw me in the habit of a hero with a laurel on my
temples and an inscription below it This is Warner the flower of
servingmen

Enter Messenger

Your unknown servant

Warn So heres another trick of fortune as unexpected for bad as
the other was for good Nothing vexes me but that I had made my game
cocksure and then to be backgammoned It must needs be the devil that
writ this letter he owed my master a spite and has paid him to the
purpose And here he comes as merry too he little thinks what
misfortune has befallen him and for my part I am ashamed to tell him

Enter Sir MARTIN laughing

Warn I wish you may have cause for all this mirth

Sir Mart Hereafter Warner be it known unto thee I will endure no
more to be thy Maygame Thou shalt no more dare to tell me I spoil thy
projects and discover thy designs for I have played such a prize
without thy help of my own motherwit tis true I am hasty sometimes
and so do harm but when I have a mind to shew myself theres no man in
England though I sayt comes near me as to point of imagination Ill
make thee acknowledge I have laid a plot that has a soul int

Warn Pray sir keep me no longer in ignorance of this rare
invention

Sir Mart Know then Warner that when I left thee I was possessed
with a terrible fear that my mistress should be married Well thought
I to myselfand mustering up all the forces of my wit I did produce
such a stratagem

Warn But what was it

Sir Mart I feigned a letter as from an unknown friend to Moody
wherein I gave him to understand that if his daughter went out this
afternoon she would infallibly be snapped by some young fellows that
lay in wait for her

Warn Very good

Sir Mart That which follows is yet better for he I sent assures me
that in that very nick of time my letter came her father was just
sending her abroad with a very foolish rascally fellow that was with
him

Warn And did you perform all this aGods name Could you do this
wonderful miracle without giving your soul to the devil for his help

Sir Mart I tell thee man I did it and it was done by the help of
no devil but this familiar of my own brain how long would it have been
ere thou couldst have thought of such a project Martin said to his
man Whos the fool now

Warn Whos the fool why who uses to be the fool he that ever was
since I knew him and ever will be so

Sir Mart What a pox I think thou art grown envious not one word in
my commendation

Warn Faith sir my skill is too little to praise you as you deserve
but if you would have it according to my poor ability you are one that
had a knock in your cradle a conceited lackwit a designing ass a
hairbrained fop a confounded busybrain with an eternal windmill in
it this in short sir is the contents of your panegyric

Sir Mart But what the devil have I done to set you thus against me

Warn Only this sir I was the foolish rascally fellow that was with
Moody and your worship was he to whom I was to bring his daughter

Sir Mart But how could I know this I am no witch

Warn No Ill be sworn for you you are no conjurer Will you go
sir

Sir Mart Will you hear my justification

Warn Shall I see the back of you speak not a word in your defence

Lord Here he isI must venture on him for the tyranny of this old
lady is unsupportable since I have made her my confident there passes
not an hour but she passes a pull at my pursestrings I shall be
ruined if I do not quit myself of her suddenly I find now by sad
experience that a mistress is much more chargeable than a wife and
after a little time too grows full as dull and insignificantMr
Warner have you a mind to do yourself a courtesy and me another

Warn I think my lord the question need not be much disputed for I
have always had a great service for your lordship and some little
kindness for myself

Lord What if you should propose mistress Christian as a wife to your
master You know hes never like to compass tother

Warn I cannot tell that my lord

Lord Five hundred pounds are yours at the day of marriage

Warn Five hundred pounds tis true the temptation is very sweet and
powerful the devil I confess has done his part and many a good
murder and treason have been committed at a cheaper rate but yet

Lord What yet

Warn To confess the truth I am resolved to bestow my master upon
that other lady as difficult as your lordship thinks it for the
honour of my wit is engaged in it Will it not be the same to your
lordship were she married to any other

Lord The very same

Warn Come my lord not to dissemble with you any longer I know
where it is that your shoe wrings you I have observed something in the
house betwixt some parties that shall be nameless And know that you
have been taking up linen at a much dearer rate than you might have had
it in any drapers in town

Lord I see I have not danced in a net before you

Warn As for that old lady whom hell confound she is the greatest
jilt in nature cheat is her study all her joy to cozen she loves
nothing but herself and draws all lines to that corrupted centre

Lord I have found her out though late First Ill undertake I neer
enjoyed her niece under the rate of five hundred pounds atime never
was womans flesh held up so high Every night I find out for a new
maidenhead and she has sold it me as often as ever Mother Temple

old lady and your mistress

way to matrimony

Rose Or servingman like ready to carry up the hot meat for your
master and then to fall upon the cold yourself

warm work ont In the first place then I must acquaint you that I

Mood O son here has been the most villainous tragedy against you

Sir John What tragedy Has there been any blood shed since I went

Mood No blood shed but as I told you a most damnable tragedy

Warn A tragedy Ill be hanged if he does not mean a stratagem

Mood Jack sauce if I say it is a tragedy it shall be a tragedy in
spite of you teach your grandam how to piss What I hope I am old
enough to spout English with you sir

Sir John But what was the reason you came not after me

Mood Twas well I did not Ill promise you there were those would
have made bold with mistress Bride and if she had stirred out of doors
there were whipsters abroad ifaith padders of maidenheads that would
have trussed her up and picked the lock of her affections ere a man
could have said whats this But by good luck I had warning of it by
a friends letter

Sir John The remedy for all such dangers is easy you may send for a
parson and have the business despatched at home

Mood A match ifaith do you provide a domine and Ill go tell
her our resolutions and hearten her up against the day of battle
                                                                Exit

Sir John Now I think ont this letter must needs come from Sir
Martin a plot of his upon my life to hinder our marriage

Warn I see sir youll still mistake him for a wit but Im much
deceived if that letter came not from another hand

Sir John From whom I prythee

Warn Nay for that you shall excuse me sir I do not love to make a
breach between persons that are to be so near related

Sir John Thou seemest to imply that my mistress was in the plot

Warn Can you make a doubt ont Do you not know she ever loved him
and can you hope she has so soon forsaken him You may make yourself
miserable if you please by such a marriage

Sir John When she is once mine her virtue will secure me

Warn Her virtue

Sir John What do you make a mock ont

Warn Not I I assure you sir I think it no such jesting matter

Sir John Why is she not honest

Warn Yes in my conscience is she for Sir Martins tongues no
slander

Sir John But does he say to the contrary

Warn If one would believe himwhich for my part I do nothe has
in a manner confessed it to me

Sir John Hell and damnation

Warn Courage sir never vex yourself Ill warrant you tis all a
lie

Sir John But how shall I be sure tis so

Warn When you are married youll soon make trial whether she be a
maid or no

Sir John I do not love to make that experiment at my own cost

Warn Then you must never marry

Sir John Ay but they have so many tricks to cheat a man which are
entailed from mother to daughter through all generations theres no
keeping a lock for that door for which every one has a key

Warn As for example their drawing up their breaths withoh you
hurt me can you be so cruel then the next day she steals a visit to
her lover that did you the courtesy beforehand and in private tells
him how she cozened you twenty to one but she takes out another lesson
with him to practise the next night

Sir John All this while miserable I must be their Maygame

Warn Tis well if you escape so for commonly he strikes in with
you and becomes your friend

Sir John Deliver me from such a friend that stays behind with my
wife when I gird on my sword to go abroad

Warn Ay theres your man sir besides he will be sure to watch
your haunts and tell her of them that if occasion be she may have
wherewithal to recriminate at least she will seem to be jealous of you
and who would suspect a jealous wife

Sir John All manner of ways I am most miserable

Warn But if she be not a maid when you marry her she may make a
good wife afterwards tis but imagining you have taken such a mans
widow

Sir John If that were all but the man will come and claim her again

Warn Examples have been frequent of those that have been wanton and
yet afterwards take up

Sir John Ay the same thing they took up before

Warn The truth is an honest simple girl thats ignorant of all
things maketh the best matrimony There is such pleasure in instructing
her the best is theres not one dunce in all the sex such a one with
a good fortune

Sir John Ay but where is she Warner

Warn Near enough but that you are too far engaged

Sir John Engaged to one that hath given me the earnest of cuckoldom
beforehand

Warn What think you then of Mrs Christian here in the house Theres
five thousand pounds and a better penny

Sir John Ay but is she fool enough

Warn Shes none of the wise virgins I can assure you

Sir John Dear Warner step into the next room and inveigle her out
this way that I may speak to her

Warn Remember above all things you keep this wooing secret if it
takes the least wind old Moody will be sure to hinder it

Sir John Dost thou think I shall get her aunts consent

Warn Leave that to me

have abused me well such a servant as this Warner is a jewel

Enter WARNER and Mrs CHRISTIAN to him

Warn There she is sir now Ill go to prepare her aunt

Chr Im but a gentlewoman forsooth

Sir John Well then sweet mistress if I get your friends consent

Chr My old lady may do what she will forsooth but by my truly I

Sir John Well sweetheart then instead of wooing you I must woo my
old lady

Chr Indeed gentleman my old lady is married already Cry you mercy
forsooth I think you are a knight

Sir John Happy in that title only to make you a lady

Chr Believe me Mr Knight I would not be a lady it makes folks
proud and so humorous and so ill huswifes forsooth

Sir John Pahshes a baby the simplest thing that ever yet I knew

Enter Lord Lady DUPE Mistress CHRISTIAN ROSE and WARNER

Lord Your promise is admirably made good to me that Sir John Swallow
should be this night married to Mrs Christian instead of that he is
more deeply engaged than ever with old Moody

Warn I cannot help those ebbs and flows of fortune

L Dupe I am sure my niece suffers most int hes come off to her
with a cold compliment of a mistake in his mistresss virtue which he
has now found out by your masters folly to be a plot of yours to
separate them

Chr To be forsaken when a woman has given her consent

Lord Tis the same scorn as to have a town rendered up and
afterwards slighted

Rose You are a sweet youth sir to use my lady so when she depended
on you is this the faith of a valet de chambre I would be ashamed to
be such a dishonour to my profession it will reflect upon us in time
we shall be ruined by your good example

Warn As how my dear lady embassadress

Rose Why they say the women govern their ladies and you govern us
So if you play fast and loose not a gallant will bribe us for our good
wills the gentle guinea will now go to the ordinary which used as duly
to steal into our hands at the stairfoot as into Mr Doctors at
parting

Lord Nights come and I expect your promise

L Dupe Fail with me if you think good sir

Chr I give no more time

Rose And if my mistress go to bed a maid tonight

Warn Heyday you are dealing with me as they do with the bankrupts
call in all your debts together theres no possibility of payment at
this rate but Ill coin for you all as fast as I can I assure you

L Dupe But you must not think to pay us with false money as you
have done hitherto

Rose Leave off your mountebank tricks with us and fall to your
business in good earnest

Warn Faith and I will Rose for to confess the truth I am a kind
of mountebank I have but one cure for all your diseases that is that
my master may marry Mrs Millisent for then Sir John Swallow will of
himself return to Mrs Christian

Lord He says true and therefore we must all be
helping to that design

Warn Ill put you upon something give me but a thinking time In the
first place get a warrant and bailiffs to arrest Sir John Swallow upon
a promise of marriage to Mrs Christian

Lord Very good

L Dupe Well all swear it

Warn I never doubted your ladyship in the least madamfor the rest

Warn Rose wheres thy lady

Mill above What have you to say to her

Warn Only to tell you madam I am going forward in the great work of
projection

Mill I know not whether you will deserve my thanks when the works
done

Warn Madam I hope you are not become indifferent to my master

Mill If he should prove a fool after all your crying up his wit I
shall be a miserable woman

Warn A fool that were a good jest ifaith but how comes your
ladyship to suspect it

Rose I have heard madam your greatest wits have ever a touch of
madness and extravagance in them so perhaps has he

Warn Theres nothing more distant than wit and folly yet like east
and west they may meet in a point and produce actions that are but a
hairs breadth from one another

Rose Ill undertake he has wit enough to make one laugh at him a
whole day together Hes a most comical person

Mill For all this I will not swear he is no fool he has still
discovered all your plots

Warn O madam thats the common fate of your Machiavelians they
draw their designs so subtle that their very fineness breaks them

Mill However Im resolved to be on the sure side I will have
certain proof of his wit before I marry him

Warn Madam Ill give you one he wears his clothes like a great
sloven and thats a sure sign of wit he neglects his outward parts
besides he speaks French sings dances plays upon the lute

Mill Does he do all this say you

Warn Most divinely madam

Mill I ask no more then let him give me a serenade immediately but
let him stand in view Ill not be cheated

Warn He shall dot madamBut how the devil knows for he sings
like a screechowl and never touched the lute
                                                               Aside

Mill Youll seet performed

Warn Now I think ont madam this will but retard our enterprise

Mill Either let him dot or see me no more

Warn Well it shall be done madam but wheres your father will not
he overhear it

Mill As good hap is hes below stairs talking with a seaman that
has brought him news from the East Indies

Warn What concernment can he have there

Mill He had a bastard son there whom he loved extremely but not
having any news from him these many years concluded him dead this son
he expects within these three days

Warn When did he see him last

Mill Not since he was seven years old

Warn A sudden thought comes into my head to make him appear before
his time let my master pass for him and by that means he may come into
the house unsuspected by your father or his rival

Mill According as he performs his serenade Ill talk with
youmake hasteI must retire a little
                                             Exit MILL from above

Rose Ill instruct him most rarely he shall never be found out but

Warn Faith I am a little nonplusd on the sudden but a warm
consolation from thy lips Rose would set my wits a working again

Rose Adieu Warner
                                                                Exit

Warn Hang your white pelf Sure sir by your largess you mistake me

muse and quite dulled her

Sir Mart How angry the poor devil is In fine thou art as choleric
as a cook by a fireside

Warn I am overheated like a gun with continual discharging my wit
Slife sir I have rarified my brains for you till they are
evaporated but come sir do something for yourself like a man I have
engaged you shall give to your mistress a serenade in your proper
person Ill borrow a lute for you

Sir Mart Ill warrant thee Ill dot man

Warn You never learned I do not think you know one stop

Sir Mart Tis no matter for that sir Ill play as fast as I can

window and set two candles by you take my landlords lute in your
hand and fumble on it and make grimaces with your mouth as if you

consequently your mistress who will come to her balcony over against
you will think it to be you and at the end of every tune Ill ring
the bell that hangs between your chamber and mine that you may know
when to have done

Sir Mart Why this is fair play now to tell a man beforehand what he
must do gramercy ifaith boy now if I fail thee

Warn About your business then your mistress and her maid appear

Enter Mrs MILLISENT and ROSE with a candle by them above

Rose We shall have rare music

Mill I wish it prove so for I suspect the knight can neither play
nor sing

Rose But if he does you are bound to pay the music madam

Mill Ill not believe it except both my ears and eyes are witnesses

Rose But tis night madam and you cannot see him yet he may play
admirably in the dark

Mill Wheres my father

Rose You need not fear him hes still employed with that same
seaman and I have set Mrs Christian to watch their discourse that
betwixt her and me Warner may have wherewithal to instruct his master

Mill But yet theres fear my father will find out the plot

Rose Not in the least for my old lady has provided two rare
disguises for the master and the man

Mill Peace I hear them beginning to tune the lute

Rose And see madam where your true knight Sir Martin is placed
yonder like Apollo with his lute in his hand and his rays about his
head SIR MARTIN appears at the adverse window a tune is played when
it is done WARNER rings and SIR MARTIN holds Did he not play
most excellently Madam

Mill He played well and yet methinks he held his lute but
untowardly

Rose Dear madam peace now for the song

  THE SONGB

         Blind love to this hour
    Had never like me a slave under his power
        Then blest be the dart
        That he threw at my heart
          For nothing can prove
    A joy so great as to be wounded with love

          My days and my nights
    Are filled to the purpose with sorrows and frights
        From my heart still I sigh
        And my eyes are neer dry
          So that Cupid be praised
    I am to the top of loves happiness raised

           My souls all on fire
    So that I have the pleasure to doat and desire
        Such a pretty soft pain
        That it tickles each vein
          Tis the dream of a smart
    Which makes me breathe short when it beats at my heart

          Sometimes in a pet
    When I am despised I my freedom would get
        But strait a sweet smile
        Does my anger beguile
          And my heart does recal
    Then the more I do struggle the lower I fall

          Heaven does not impart
    Such a grace as to love unto every ones heart
        For many may wish
        To be wounded and miss
          Then blest be loves fire
    And more blest her eyes that first taught me desire

The Song being done WARNER rings again but SIR MARTIN continues
fumbling and gazing on his Mistress

Mill A pretty humoured song But stay methinks he plays and sings
still and yet we cannot hear him Play louder Sir Martin that we may
have the fruits ont

Warn Peeping Death this abominable fool will spoil all again
Damn him he stands making his grimaces yonder and he looks so
earnestly upon his mistress that he hears me not
                                                         Rings again

Mill Ah ah have I found you out sir Now as I live and breathe
this is pleasant Rose his man played and sung for him and he it
seems did not know when he should give over
                                              MILL and ROSE laugh

Warn They have found him out and laugh yonder as if they would
split their sides Why Mr Fool Oaf Coxcomb will you hear none of
your names

Mill Sir Martin Sir Martin take your mans counsel and keep time
with your music

Sir Mart Peeping Hah What do you say madam How does your
ladyship like my music

Mill O most heavenly just like the harmony of the spheres that is
to be admired and never heard

Warn You have ruined all by your not leaving off in time

Sir Mart What the devil would you have a man do when my hand is in
Well omy conscience I think there is a fate upon me
                                                        Noise within

Mill Look Rose whats the matter

Rose Tis Sir John Swallow pursued by the bailiffs madam according
to our plot it seems they have dogged him thus late to his lodging

Mill Thats well for though I begin not to love this fool yet I am
glad I shall be rid of him
                                             Exeunt MILL and ROSE

Enter SIR JOHN pursued by three Bailiffs over the stage

puppets tis to no purpose whatever I do for him

Enter SIR JOHN and SIR MARTIN having driven away the Bailiffs

Warn Thats impossible thou hast a skull so thick no sword can
pierce it but much good may it do you sir with the fruits of your
valour You rescued your rival when he was to be arrested on purpose
to take him off from your mistress

Sir Mart Why this is ever the fate of ingenious men nothing thrives

Rose This child in his fathers time he durst not own but bred him
privately in the isle of Ely till he was seven years old and from
thence sent him with one Bonaventure a merchant for the East Indies

lived up and down in the Moguls country unheard of by his father till

Drawwater a vintner at the Rose

question to me knowing how thou hast used me

Warn Now sir you may see what comes of your indiscretion and

EPILOGUE


  As country vicars when the sermons done
  Run headlong to the benediction
  Well knowing though the better sort may stay
  The vulgar rout will run unblest away
  So we when once our play is done make haste
  With a short epilogue to close your taste
  In thus withdrawing we seem mannerly
  But when the curtains down we peep and see
  A jury of the wits who still stay late
  And in their club decree the poor plays fate
  Their verdict back is to the boxes brought
  Thence all the town pronounces it their thought
  Thus gallants we like Lilly can foresee
  But if you ask us what our doom will be
  We by tomorrow will our fortune cast
  As he tells all things when the year is past




  THE

  TEMPEST


  OR THE

  ENCHANTED ISLAND


  A

  COMEDY




THE TEMPEST


In this alteration of the Tempest Dryden acknowledges his obligation
to Sir William Davenant whom he extols for his quick and piercing
imagination Sir William was the son of an innkeeper in Oxford whose
house was frequented by our immortal Shakespeare and hence an
illfounded tradition ascribed to him a paternal interest in young
Davenant But this slander on Shakespeares moral character has been
fully refuted in the Prolegomena to Johnson and Steevens edition of his
plays Davenant was appointed poet laureat upon the death of Ben Jonson
During the civil wars he distinguished himself on the royal side was
lieutenantgeneral of ordnance to the earl of Newcastle and was
knighted by Charles at the siege of Gloucester He was afterwards much
trusted by Henrietta the queendowager and was finally made prisoner
by an English man of war in attempting to convey a colony of loyalists
to Virginia After a long captivity in the Tower he was liberated
through the intercession of the lordkeeper Whitelocke the wisest and
most temperate of the counsellors of the ruling power Through his
countenance Sir William was protected or connived at in bringing
forward certain interludes and operas even during the rigid sway of
fanaticism After the restoration he became manager of a company of
players called the duke of Yorks servants in distinction to the
kings company which was directed by Killigrew He introduced upon the
stage much pomp in dress scenery and decoration as if to indemnify
the theatrical muses for the poor shifts to which they had been reduced
during the usurpation Sir William Davenant died in  at the age of


Gondibert his greatest performance incurred when first published
more ridicule and in latter times more neglect than its merits
deserve An epic poem in elegiac stanzas must always be tedious
because no structure of verse is more unfavourable to narration than
that which almost peremptorily requires each sentence to be restricted
or protracted to four lines But the liveliness of Davenants
imagination which Dryden has pointed out as his most striking
attribute has illuminated even the dull and dreary path which he has
chosen and perhaps few poems afford more instances of vigorous
conceptions and even felicity of expression than the neglected
GondibertC

The alteration of the Tempest was Davenants last work and it seems to
have been undertaken chiefly with a view to give room for scenical
decoration Few readers will think the play much improved by the
introduction of the sealanguage which Davenant had acquired during the
adventurous period of his life Nevertheless the ludicrous contest
betwixt the sailors for the dukedom and viceroyship of a barren island
gave much amusement at the time and some of the expressions were long
after proverbialD Much cannot be said for Davenants ingenuity in
contrasting the character of a woman who had never seen a man with
that of a man who had never seen a woman or in inventing a sister
monster for Caliban The majestic simplicity of Shakespeares plan is
injured by thus doubling his characters and his wild landscape is
converted into a formal parterre where each alley has its brother In
sketching characters drawn from fancy and not from observation the
palm of genius must rest with the first inventor others are but
copyists and a copy shews no where to such disadvantage as when placed
by the original Besides although we are delighted with the feminine
simplicity of Miranda it becomes unmanly childishness in Hippolito and
the premature coquetry of Dorinda is disgusting when contrasted with
the maidenly purity that chastens the simplicity of Shakespeares
heroine The latter seems to display as it were by instinct the innate
dignity of her sex the former to shew even in solitude the germ of
those vices by which in a voluptuous age the female character becomes
degraded The wild and savage character of Caliban is also sunk into low
and vulgar buffoonery

Dryden has not informed us of the share he had in this alteration It
was probably little more than the care of adapting it to the stage The
prologue is one of the most masterly tributes ever paid at the shrine of
Shakespeare

From the epilogue the Tempest appears to have been acted in 
Although Dryden was under engagements to the kings company this play
was performed by the dukes servants probably because written in
conjunction with Davenant their manager It was not published until



Footnotes

Footnote C An excellent critical essay upon the beauties and defects
of Davenants epic may be found in Aikins Miscellanies Those who are
insensible to theme rits of the poem may admire the courage of the
author who wrote some part of it when he conceived himself within a
week of being hanged A tradition prevails that his life was saved by
Milton whose life in return he saved at the Restoration Were the
story true how vast was the requital

PREFACE

The writing of prefaces to plays was probably invented by some very
ambitious poet who never thought he had done enough Perhaps by some
ape of the French eloquence which uses to make a business of a letter
of gallantry an examen of a farce and in short a great pomp and
ostentation of words on every trifle This is certainly the talent of
that nation and ought not to be invaded by any other They do that out
of gaiety which would be an impositionE upon us

We may satisfy ourselves with surmounting them in the scene and safely
leave them those trappings of writings and flourishes of the pen with
which they adorn the borders of their plays and which are indeed no
more than good landscapes to a very indifferent picture I must proceed
no farther in this argument lest I run myself beyond my excuse for
writing this Give me leave therefore to tell you reader that I do
not set a value on any thing I have written in this play but out of
gratitude to the memory of Sir William Davenant who did me the honour
to join me with him in the alteration of it

It was originally Shakespeares a poet for whom he had particularly a
high veneration and whom he first taught me to admire The play itself
had formerly been acted with success in the Black Friars And our
excellent Fletcher had so great a value for it that he thought fit to
make use of the same design not much varied a second time Those who
have seen his SeaVoyage may easily discern that it was a copy of
Shakespeares Tempest The storm the desert island and the woman who
had never seen a man are all sufficient testimonies of it But Fletcher
was not the only poet who made use of Shakespeares plot Sir John
Suckling a professed admirer of our author has followed his footsteps
in his Goblins his Regmella being an open imitation of
Shakespeares Miranda and his spirits though counterfeit yet are
copied from Ariel But Sir William Davenant as he was a man of a
quick and piercing imagination soon found that somewhat might be added
to the design of Shakespeare of which neither Fletcher nor Suckling had
ever thought And therefore to put the last hand to it he designed
the counterpart to Shakespeares plot namely that of a man who had
never seen a woman that by this means those two characters of innocence
and love might the more illustrate and commend each other This
excellent contrivance he was pleased to communicate to me and to desire
my assistance in it I confess that from the very first moment it so
pleased me that I never writ any thing with more delight I must
likewise do him that justice to acknowledge that my writing received
daily his amendments and that is the reason why it is not so faulty as
the rest which I have done without the help or correction of so
judicious a friend The comical parts of the sailors were also of his
invention and for the most part his writing as you will easily
discover by the style In the time I writ with him I had the
opportunity to observe somewhat more nearly of him than I had formerly
done when I had only a bare acquaintance with him I found him then of
so quick a fancy that nothing was proposed to him on which he could
not suddenly produce a thought extremely pleasant and surprising and
those first thoughts of his contrary to the old Latin proverb were not
always the least happy And as his fancy was quick so likewise were the
products of it remote and new He borrowed not of any other and his
imaginations were such as could not easily enter into any other man
His corrections were sober and judicious and he corrected his own
writings much more severely than those of another man bestowing twice
the time and labour in polishing which he used in invention It had
perhaps been easy enough for me to have arrogated more to myself than
was my due in the writing of this play and to have passed by his name
with silence in the publication of it with the same ingratitude which
others have used to him whose writings he hath not only corrected as
he hath done this but has had a greater inspection over them and
sometimes added whole scenes together which may as easily be
distinguished from the rest as true gold from counterfeit by the
weight But besides the unworthiness of the action which deterred me
from it there being nothing so base as to rob the dead of his
reputation I am satisfied I could never have received so much honour
in being thought the author of any poem how excellent soever as I
shall from the joining my imperfections with the merit and name of
Shakespeare and Sir William Davenant

PROLOGUE

As when a trees cut down the secret root Lives under ground and
thence new branches shoot So from old Shakespeares honoured dust
this day Springs up and buds a newreviving play Shakespeare who
taught by none did first impart To Fletcher wit to labouring Jonson
art He monarchlike gave those his subjects law And is that nature
which they paint and draw Fletcher reached that which on his heights
did grow Whilst Jonson crept and gathered all below This did his
love and this his mirth digest One imitates him most the other best
If they have since outwrit all other men Tis with the drops which fell
from Shakespeares pen The storm which vanished on the neighbouring
shore Was taught by Shakespeares Tempest first to roar That innocence
and beauty which did smile In Fletcher grew on this enchanted isle
But Shakespeares magic could not copied be Within that circle none
durst walk but he I must confess twas bold nor would you now That
liberty to vulgar wits allow Which works by magic supernatural things
But Shakespeares power is sacred as a kings Those legends from old
priesthood were received And he then writ as people then believed But
if for Shakespeare we your grace implore We for our theatre shall want
it more Who by our dearth of youths are forced to employ One of our
women to present a boy And thats a transformation you will say
Exceeding all the magic in the play Let none expect in the last act
to find Her sex transformed from man to womankind Whateer she was
before the play began All you shall see of her is perfect man Or if
your fancy will be farther led To find her womanit must be abed

ACT I

SCENE IThe front of the stage is opened and the band of twentyfour
violins with the harpsicals and theorbos which accompany the voices
are placed between the pit and the stage While the overture is playing
the curtain rises and discovers a new frontispiece joined to the great
pilasters on each side of the stage This frontispiece is a noble arch
supported by large wreathed columns of the Corinthian order the
wreathings of the columns are beautified with roses wound round them
and several Cupids flying about them On the cornice just over the
capitals sits on either side a figure with a trumpet in one hand and
a palm in the other representing Fame A little farther on the same
cornice on each side of a compasspediment lie a lion and a unicorn
the supporters of the royal arms of England In the middle of the arch
are several angels holding the kings arms as if they were placing
them in the midst of that compasspediment Behind this is the scene
which represents a thick cloudy sky a very rocky coast and a
tempestuous sea in perpetual agitation This tempest supposed to be
raised by magick has many dreadful objects in it as several spirits
in horrid shapes flying down amongst the sailors then rising and
crossing in the air And when the ship is sinking the whole house is
darkened and a shower of fire falls upon them This is accompanied with
lightning and several claps of thunder to the end of the storm

SCENE IIIn the midst of the shower of fire the scene changes The
cloudy sky rocks and sea vanish and when the lights return discover
that beautiful part of the island which was the habitation of
PROSPERO Tis composed of three walks of cypresstrees each sidewalk
leads to a cave in one of which PROSPERO keeps his daughter in the
other HIPPOLITO The middlewalk is of great depth and leads to an
open part of the island

Enter PROSPERO and MIRANDA


  Prosp Miranda wheres your sister

  Mir I left her looking from the pointed rock
  At the walks end on the huge beat of waters

  Prosp It is a dreadful object

  Mir If by your art
  My dearest father you have put them in
  This roar allay them quickly

  Prosp I have so ordered
  That not one creature in the ship is lost
  I have done nothing but in care of thee
  My daughter and thy pretty sister
  You both are ignorant of what you are
  Not knowing whence I am nor that Im more
  Than Prospero master of a narrow cell
  And thy unhappy father

  Mir I neer endeavoured
  To know more than you were pleased to tell me

  Prosp I should inform thee farther

  Mir You often sir began to tell me what I am
    But then you stopt

  Prosp The hours now come
  Obey and be attentive Canst thou remember
  A time before we came into this cell
  I do not think thou canst for then thou wert not
  Full three years old

  Mir Certainly I can sir

  Prosp Tell me the image then of any thing
  Which thou dost keep in thy remembrance still

  Mir Sir had I not four or five women once that tended me

  Prosp Thou hadst and more Miranda What seest thou else
  In the dark backward and abyss of time
  If thou rememberest aught ere thou camst here
  Then how thou camst thou mayest remember too

  Mir Sir that I do not

  Prosp Fifteen years since Miranda
  Thy father was the duke of Milan and
  A prince of power

  Mir Sir are not you my father

  Prosp Thy mother was all virtue and she said
  Thou wast my daughter and thy sister too

  Mir O heavens what foul play had we that
  We hither came or wast a blessing that we did

  Prosp Both both my girl

  Mir But sir I pray proceed

  Prosp My brother and thy uncle called Antonio
  To whom I trusted then the manage of my state
  While I was wrapped with secret studiesthat false uncle
  Having attained the craft of granting suits
  And of denying them whom to advance
  Or lop for overtoppingsoon was grown
  The ivy which did hide my princely trunk
  And sucked my verdure out Thou attendst not

  Mir O good sir I do

  Prosp I thus neglecting worldly ends and bent
  To closeness and the bettering of my mind
  Waked in my false brother an evil nature He did believe
  He was indeed the duke because he then
  Did execute the outward face of sovereignty
  Dost thou still mark me

  Mir Your story would cure deafness

  Prosp This false duke
  Needs would be absolute in Milan and confederate
  With Savoys duke to give him tribute and
  To do him homage

  Mir False man

  Prosp This duke of Savoy being an enemy
  To me inveterate strait grants my brothers suit
  And on a night mated to his design
  Antonio opened the gates of Milan and
  In the dead of darkness hurried me thence
  With thy young sister and thy crying self

  Mir But wherefore did they not that hour destroy us

  Prosp They durst not girl in Milan for the love
  My people bore me in short they hurried us
  Away to Savoy and thence aboard a bark at Nissas port
  Bore us some leagues to sea where they prepared
  A rotten carcase of a boat not rigged
  No tackle sail nor mast the very rats
  Instinctively had quit it

  Mir Alack what trouble
  Was I then to you

  Prosp Thou and thy sister were
  Two cherubims which did preserve me You both
  Did smile infused with fortitude from heaven

  Mir How came we ashore

  Prosp By providence divine
  Some food we had and some fresh water which
  A nobleman of Savoy called Gonzalo
  Appointed master of that black design
  Gave us with rich garments and all necessaries
  Which since have steaded much And of his gentleness
  Knowing I loved my books he furnished me
  From mine own library with volumes which
  I prize above my dukedom

  Mir Would I might see that man

  Prosp Here in this island we arrived and here
  Have I your tutor been But by my skill
  I find that my midheaven doth depend
  On a most happy star whose influence
  If I now court not but omit my fortunes
  Will ever after droop Here cease more questions
  Thou art inclined to sleep Tis a good dulness
  And give it way I know thou canst not chuse
                                                    She falls asleep
  Come away my spirit I am ready now approach
  My Ariel come

Enter ARIEL

  Ariel All hail great master grave
  Sir hail I come to answer thy best pleasure
  Be it to fly to swim to shoot into the fire
  To ride into the curled clouds to thy strong bidding
  Task Ariel and all his qualities

  Prosp Hast thou spirit performed to point
  The tempest that I bade thee

  Ariel To every article
  I boarded the dukes ship now on the beak
  Now in the waste the deck in every cabin
  I flamed amazement and sometimes I seemed
  To burn in many places on the topmast
  The yards and bowsprit I did flame distinctly
  Nay once I rained a shower of fire upon them

  Prosp My brave spirit
  Who was so firm so constant that this coil
  Did not infect his reason

  Ariel Not a soul
  But felt a fever of the mind and played
  Some tricks of desperation all
  But mariners plunged in the foaming brine
  And quit the vessel The dukes son Ferdinand
  With hair upstaring more like reeds than hair
  Was the first man that leaped cried Hell is empty
  And all the devils are here

  Prosp Why thats my spirit
  But was not this nigh shore

  Ariel Close by my master

  Prosp But Ariel are they safe

  Ariel Not a hair perished
  In troops I have dispersed them round this isle
  The dukes son I have landed by himself
  Whom I have left warming the air with sighs
  In an odd angle of the isle and sitting
  His arms enfolded in this sad knot

  Prosp Say how thou hast disposed the mariners
  Of the dukes ship and all the rest othe fleet

  Ariel Safely in harbour
  Is the dukes ship in the deep nook where once
  Thou calledst me up at midnight to fetch dew
  From the still vexed Bermoothes there shes hid
  The mariners all under hatches stowed
  Whom with a charm joined to their suffered labour
  I have left asleep And for the rest othe fleet
  Which I dispersed they all have met again
  And are upon the Mediterranean float
  Bound sadly home for Italy
  Supposing that they saw the dukes ship wrecked
  And his great person perish

  Prosp Ariel thy charge
  Exactly is performed But theres more work
  What is the time othe day

  Ariel Past the mid season

  Prosp At least two glasses
  The time tween six and now must by us both
  Be spent most preciously

  Ariel Is there more toil
  Since thou dost give me pains let me remember
  Thee what thou hast promised which is not yet
  Performed me

  Prosp How now moody
  What ist thou canst demand

  Ariel My liberty

  Prosp Before the time be outno more

  Ariel I prythee
  Remember I have done thee faithful service
  Told thee no lies made thee no mistakings
  Served without or grudge or grumblings
  Thou didst promise to bate me a full year

  Prosp Dost thou forget
  From what a torment I did free thee

  Ariel No

  Prosp Thou dost and thinkst it much to tread the ooze
  Of the salt deep
  To run against the sharp wind of the north
  To do my business in the veins of the earth
  When it is baked with frost

  Ariel I do not sir

  Prosp Thou liest malignant thingHast thou forgot
  The foul witch Sycorax who with age and envy
  Was grown into a hoop Hast thou forgot her

  Ariel No sir

  Prosp Thou hast Where was she born Speak tell me

  Ariel Sir in Argier

  Prosp Oh was she soI must
  Once every month recount what thou hast been
  Which thou forgettest This damned Witch Sycorax
  For mischiefs manifold and sorceries
  Too terrible to enter human hearing
  From Argier thou knowst was banished
  But for one thing she did
  They would not take her lifeIs not this true

  Ariel Ay sir

  Prosp This blueeyed hag was hither brought with child
  And here was left by the sailors Thou my slave
  As thou reportst thyself wast then her servant
  And cause thou wast a spirit too delicate
  To act her earthy and abhorred commands
  Refusing her grand hests she did confine thee
  By help of her more potent ministers
  In her unmitigable rage into a cloven pine
  Within whose rift imprisoned thou didst painfully
  Remain a dozen years within which space she died
  And left thee there where thou didst vent thy groans
  As fast as millwheels strike Then was this isle
  Save for two brats which she did litter here
  The brutish Caliban and his twinsister
  Two freckled hagborn whelps not honoured with
  A human shape

  Ariel Yes Caliban her son and Sycorax his sister

  Prosp Dull thing I say soHe
  That Caliban and she that Sycorax
  Whom I now keep in service Thou best knowst
  What torment I did find thee in thy groans
  Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts
  Of everangry bears it was a torment
  To lay upon the damned which Sycorax
  Could neer again undo It was my art
  When I arrived and heard thee that made the pine
  To gape and let thee out

  Ariel I thank thee master

  Prosp If thou more murmurest I will rend an oak
  And peg thee in his knotty entrails till thou
  Hast howled away twelve winters more

  Ariel Pardon master
  I will be correspondent to command
  And be a gentle spirit

  Prosp Do so and after two days Ill discharge thee

  Ariel Thanks my great master But I have yet one request

  Prosp Whats that my spirit

  Ariel I know that this days business is important
  Requiring too much toil for one alone
  I have a gentle spirit for my love
  Who twice seven years has waited for my freedom
  Let it appear it will assist me much
  And we with mutual joy shall entertain
  Each other This I beseech you grant me

  Prosp You shall have your desire

  Ariel Thats my noble masterMilcha
                                 MILCHA flies down to his assistance

  Milc I am here my love

  Ariel Thou art free Welcome my dear
  What shall we do Say say what shall we do

  Prosp Be subject to no sight but mine invisible
  To every eyeball else Hence with diligence
  Anon thou shalt know more
                              They both fly up and cross in the air
  Thou hast slept well my child
                                                              To MIR

  Mir The sadness of your story put heaviness in me

  Prosp Shake it offCome on Ill now call Caliban
  my slave who never yields us a kind answer

  Mir Tis a creature sir I do not love to look on

  Prosp But as it is we cannot miss him He does make our fire fetch
  in our wood and serve in offices that profit usWhat ho slave
  Caliban thou earth thou speak

  Calib within Theres wood enough within

  Prosp Thou poisonous slave got by the devil himself
  Upon thy wicked dam come forth

Enter CALIBAN

Calib As wicked dew as eer my mother brushed with ravens feather
from unwholesome fens drop on you both A southwest wind blow on you
and blister you all oer

Prosp For this be sure tonight thou shalt have cramps
sidestitches that shall pen thy breath up Urchins shall prick thee
till thou bleedst Thou shalt be pinched as thick as honeycombs each
pinch more stinging than the bees which made them

Calib I must eat my dinner This islands mine by Sycorax my mother
which thou tookst from me When thou earnest first thou stroakdst me
and madest much of me wouldst give me water with berries int and
teach me how to name the bigger light and how the less that burn by
day and night and then I loved thee and showed thee all the qualities
of the isle the freshsprings brinepits barren places and fertile
Cursed be I that I did so All the charms of Sycorax toads beetles
bats light on thee for I am all the subjects that thou hast I first
was mine own lord and here thou stayest me in this hard rock while
thou dost keep from me the rest othe island

Prosp Thou most lying slave whom stripes may move not kindness I
have used thee filth as thou art with human care and lodged thee in
mine own cell till thou didst seek to violate the honour of my
children

Calib Oh ho oh ho would it had been done Thou didst prevent me
I had peopled else this isle with Calibans

Prosp Abhorred slave who neer wouldst any print of goodness take
being capable of all ill I pitied thee took pains to make thee speak
taught thee each hour one thing or other When thou didst not savage
know thy own meaning but wouldst gabble like a thing most brutish I
endowed thy purposes with words which made them knownBut thy wild
race though thou didst learn had that int which good natures could
not abide to be with therefore wast thou deservedly pent up into this
rock

Calib You taught me language and my profit by it is that I know to
curse The red botch rid you for learning me your language

  Prosp Hagseed hence
  Fetch us in fuel and be quick
  To answer other businessShrugst thou malice
  If thou neglectest or dost unwillingly
  What I command Ill rack thee with old cramps
  Fill all thy bones with aches make thee roar
  That beasts shall tremble at thy din

  Calib No prythee
  I must obey His art is of such power
  It would controul my dams god Setebos
  And make a vassal of him

  Prosp So slave hence
                              Exeunt PROSP and CALIB severally

  Enter DORINDA

  Dor Oh sister what have I beheld

  Mir What is it moves you so

  Dor From yonder rock
  As I my eyes cast down upon the seas
  The whistling winds blew rudely on my face
  And the waves roared at first I thought the war
  Had been between themselves but straight I spied
  A huge great creature

  Mir O you mean the ship

  Dor Ist not a creature thenIt seemed alive

  Mir But what of it

  Dor This floating ram did bear his horns above
  All tied with ribbands ruffling in the wind
  Sometimes he nodded down his head awhile
  And then the waves did heave him to the moon
  He clambering to the top of all the billows
  And then again he curtsied down so low
  I could not see him Till at last all sidelong
  With a great crack his belly burst in pieces

  Mir There all had perished
  Had not my fathers magic art relieved them
  But sister I have stranger news to tell you
  In this great creature there were other creatures
  And shortly we may chance to see that thing
  Which you have heard my father call a man

  Dor But what is that For yet he never told me

  Mir I know no more than youBut I have heard
  My father say we women were made for him

  Dor What that he should eat us sister

  Mir No sure you see my father is a man and yet
  He does us good I would he were not old

  Dor Methinks indeed it would be finer if
  We two had two young fathers

  Mir No sister no If they were young my father
  Said we must call them brothers

  Dor But pray how does it come that we two are
    Not brothers then and have not beards like him

  Mir Now I confess you pose me

  Dor How did he come to be our father too

  Mir I think he found us when we both were little
  And grew within the ground

  Dor Why could he not find more of us Pray sister
  Let you and I look up and down one day
  To find some little ones for us to play with

  Mir Agreed but now we must go in This is
  The hour wherein my fathers charm will work
  Which seizes all who are in open air
  The effect of this great art I long to see
  Which will perform as much as magic can

  Dor And I methinks more long to see a man
                                                              Exeunt




ACT II SCENE I

The scene changes to the wilder part of the Island It is composed of
divers sorts of trees and barren places with a prospect of the sea at a
great distance


Enter STEPHANO MUSTACHO and VENTOSO

Vent The runlet of brandy was a loving runlet and floated after us
out of pure pity

Must This kind bottle like an old acquaintance swam after it And

  Vent Tis well we have found something since we landed
  I prythee fill a sup and let it go round
  Where hast thou laid the runlet

Must In the hollow of an old tree

Vent Fill apace we cannot live long in this barren island and we
may take a sup before death as well as others drink at our funerals

Must This is prize brandy we steal custom and it costs nothing
Lets have two rounds more

Vent Master what have you saved

Vent But come master sorrow is dry Theres for you again

Vent This isles our own thats our comfort for the duke the
prince and all their train are perished

Must Our ship is sunk and we can never get home again We must een

orderly heaven will drive shipwrecks ashore to make us all rich
Therefore let us carry good consciences and not eat one another

my sceptre for I was master at sea and will be duke on land You
Mustacho have been my mate and shall be my viceroy

SCENE IICypress trees and a Cave

Enter PROSPERO alone


  Prosp Tis not yet fit to let my daughters know
  I keep the infant duke of Mantua
  So near them in this isle
  Whose father dying bequeathed him to my care
  Till my false brother when he designed to usurp
  My dukedom from me exposed him to that fate
  He meant for me
  By calculation of his birth I saw
  Death threatning him if till some time were past
  He should behold the face of any woman
  And now the dangers nighHippolito

Enter HIPPOLITO

  Hip Sir I attend your pleasure

  Prosp How I have loved thee from thy infancy
  Heaven knows and thou thyself canst bear me witness
  Therefore accuse not me of thy restraint

  Hip Since I knew life youve kept me in a rock
  And you this day have hurried me from thence
  Only to change my prison not to free me
  I murmur not but I may wonder at it

  Prosp O gentle youth fate waits for thee abroad
  A black star threatens thee and death unseen
  Stands ready to devour thee

  Hip You taught me
  Not to fear him in any of his shapes
  Let me meet death rather than be a prisoner

  Prosp Tis pity he should seize thy tender youth

  Hip Sir I have often heard you say no creature
  Lived in this isle but those which man was lord of
  Why then should I fear

  Prosp But here are creatures which I named not to thee
  Who share mans sovereignty by natures laws
  And oft depose him from it

  Hip What are those creatures sir

  Prosp Those dangerous enemies of men called women

  Hip Women I never heard of them before
  What are women like

  Prosp Imagine something between young men and angels
  Fatally beauteous and have killing eyes
  Their voices charm beyond the nightingales
  They are all enchantment Those who once behold them
  Are made their slaves for ever

  Hip Then I will wink and fight with them

  Prosp Tis but in vain
  Theyll haunt you in your very sleep

  Hip Then Ill revenge it on them when I wake

  Prosp You are without all possibility of revenge
  They are so beautiful that you can neer attempt
  Nor wish to hurt them

  Hip Are they so beautiful

  Prosp Calm sleep is not so soft nor winter suns
  Nor summer shades so pleasant

  Hip Can they be fairer than the plumes of swans
  Or more delightful than the peacocks feathers
  Or than the gloss upon the necks of doves
  Or have more various beauty than the rainbow
  These I have seen and without danger wondered at

  Prosp All these are far below them Nature made
  Nothing but woman dangerous and fair
  Therefore if you should chance to see them
  Avoid them straight I charge you

  Hip Well since you say they are so dangerous
  Ill so far shun them as I may with safety
  Of the unblemished honour which you taugt me
  But let them not provoke me for Im sure
  I shall not then forbear them

  Prosp Go in and read the book I gave you last
  Tomorrow I may bring you better news

  Hip I shall obey you sir
                                                            Exit HIP

  Prosp So so I hope this lesson has secured him
  For I have been constrained to change his lodging
  From yonder rock where first I bred him up
  And here have brought him home to my own cell
  Because the shipwreck happened near his mansion
  I hope he will not stir beyond his limits
  For hitherto he hath been all obedience
  The planets seem to smile on my designs
  And yet there is one sullen cloud behind
  I would it were dispersed

Enter MIRANDA and DORINDA

  How my daughters
  I thought I had instructed them enough
  Children retire why do you walk this way

  Mir It is within our bounds sir

  Prosp But both take heed that path is very
  dangerous remember what I told you

  Dor Is the man that way sir

  Prosp All that you can imagine ill is there
  The curled lion and the rugged bear
  Are not so dreadful as that man

  Mir Oh me why stay we here then

  Dor Ill keep far enough from his den I warrant him

  Mir But you have told me sir you are a man
  And yet you are not dreadful

  Prosp Ay child but I
  Am a tame man old men are tame by nature
  But all the danger lies in a wild young man

  Dor Do they run wild about the woods

  Prosp No they are wild within doors in chambers and in closets

  Dor But father I would stroak them and make them gentle then sure
  they would not hurt me

  Prosp You must not trust them child No woman can come near them
  but she feels a pain full nine months Well I must in for new affairs
  require my presence Be you Miranda your sisters guardian
                                                           Exit PROS

  Dor Come sister shall we walk the other way
  The man will catch us else We have but two legs
  And he perhaps has four

  Mir Well sister though he have yet look about you

  Dor Come back that way is towards his den

  Mir Let me alone Ill venture first for sure he can
  Devour but one of us at once

  Dor How dare you venture

  Mir Well find him sitting like a hare ins form
  And he shall not see us

  Dor Ay but you know my father charged us both

  Mir But who shall tell him ont well keep each others counsel

  Dor I dare not for the world

  Mir But how shall we hereafter shun him if we do not know him first

  Dor Nay I confess I would fain see him too
  I find it in my nature because my father has forbidden me

  Mir Ay theres it sister if he had said nothing I had been quiet
  Go softly and if you see him first be quick and beckon me away

  Dor Well if he does catch me Ill humble myself to him and ask him
  pardon as I do my father when I have done a fault

  Mir And if I can but escape with life I had rather be in pain nine
  months as my father threatened than lose my longing
                                                              Exeunt


SCENE III

Enter HIPPOLITO


  Hip Prospero has often said that nature makes
  Nothing in vain Why then are women made
  Are they to suck the poison of the earth
  As gaudy coloured serpents are Ill ask
  That question when next I see him here

Enter MIRANDA and DORINDA peeping

  Dor O sister there it is it walks about
  Like one of us

  Mir Ay just so and has legs as we have too

  Hip It strangely puzzles me Yet tis most likely
  Women are somewhat between men and spirits

  Dor Hark it talkssure this is not it my father meant
  For this is just like one of us Methinks
  I am not half so much afraid ont as
  I was see now it turns this way

  Mir Heaven what a goodly thing it is

  Dor Ill go nearer it

  Mir O no tis dangerous sister Ill go to it
  I would not for the world that you should venture
  My father charged me to secure you from it

  Dor I warrant you this is a tame man dear sister
  Hell not hurt me I see it by his looks

  Mir Indeed he will but go back and he shall eat me first Fie are
  you not ashamed to be so inquisitive

  Dor You chide me for it and would give him yourself

  Mir Come back or I will tell my father
  Observe how he begins to stare already
  Ill meet the danger first and then call you

  Dor Nay sister you shall never vanquish me in kindness Ill
  venture you no more than you will me

  Prosp within Miranda child where are you

  Mir Do you not hear my father call Go in

  Dor Twas you he named not me I will but
  say my prayers and follow you immediately

  Mir Well sister youll repent it
                                                            Exit MIR

  Dor Though I die for it I must have the other peep

  Hip What thing is that Seeing her Sure tis some infant of
  The sun dressed in his fathers gayest beams
  And comes to play with birds My sight is dazzled
  And yet I find Im loth to shut my eyes
  I must go nearer itbut stay a while
  May it not be that beauteous murderer woman
  Which I was charged to shun Speak what art thou
  Thou shining vision

  Dor Alas I know not but Im told I am
  A woman do not hurt me pray fair thing

  Hip Id sooner tear my eyes out than consent
  To do you any harm though I was told
  A woman was my enemy

  Dor I never knew
  What twas to be an enemy nor can I eer
  Prove so to that which looks like you For though
  Ive been charged by him whom yet I neer disobeyed
  To shun your presence yet Id rather die
  Than lose it therefore I hope you will not have the heart
  To hurt me Though I fear you are a man
  The dangerous thing of which I have been warned
  Pray tell me what you are

  Hip I must confess I was informed I am a man
  But if I fright you I shall wish I were some other creature
  I was bid to fear you too

  Dor Ah me Heaven grant we be not poison to
  Each other Alas can we not meet but we must die

  Hip I hope not so for when two poisonous creatures
  Both of the same kind meet yet neither dies
  Ive seen two serpents harmless to each other
  Though they have twined into a mutual knot
  If we have any venom in us sure we cannot be
  More poisonous when we meet than serpents are
  You have a hand like minemay I not gently touch it
                                                      Takes her hand

  Dor Ive touched my fathers and my sisters hands
  And felt no pain but now alas theres something
  When I touch yours which makes me sigh Just so
  Ive seen two turtles mourning when they met
  Yet mines a pleasing grief and so methought
  Was theirs For still they mourned and still they seemed
  To murmur too and yet they often met

  Hip Oh heavens I have the same sense too your hand
  Methinks goes through me I feel it at my heart
  And find it pleases though it pains me

  Prosp within Dorinda

  Dor My father calls again ah I must leave you

  Hip Alas Im subject to the same command

  Dor This is my first offence against my father
  Which he by severing us too cruelly does punish

  Hip And this is my first trespass too But he
  Hath more offended truth than we have him
  He said our meeting would destructive be
  But I no death but in our parting see
                                                    Exeunt severally

  Gonz Beseech your grace be merry You have cause
  So have we all of joy for our strange escape
  Then wisely good sir weigh our sorrow with
  Our comfort

  Alon Prythee peace you cram these words
  Into my ears against my stomach how
  Can I rejoice when my dear son perhaps
  This very moment is made a meal to some strange fish

  Anto Sir he may live
  I saw him beat the billows under him
  And ride upon their backs I do not doubt
  He came alive to land

  Alon No no hes gone
  And you and I Antonio were those
  Who caused his death

  Anto How could we help it

  Alon Then then we should have helped it
  When thou betraydst thy brother Prospero
  And Mantuas infant sovereign to my power
  And when I too ambitious took by force
  Anothers right Then lost we Ferdinand
  Then forfeited our navy to this tempest

  Anto Indeed we first broke truce with heaven
  You to the waves an infant prince exposed
  And on the waves have lost an only son
  I did usurp my brothers fertile lands
  And now am cast upon this desertisle

  Gonz These sirs tis true were crimes of a black dye
  But both of you have made amends to heaven
  By your late voyage into Portugal
  Where in defence of christianity
  Your valour has repulsed the Moors of Spain

  Alon O name it not Gonzalo
  No act but penitence can expiate guilt
  Must we teach heaven what price to set on murder
  What rate on lawless power and wild ambition
  Or dare we traffic with the powers above
  And sell by weight a good deed for a bad
                                                 A flourish of music

  Gonz Music and in the air sure we are shipwrecked
  On the dominions of some merry devil

  Anto This isles enchanted ground for I have heard
  Swift voices flying by my ear and groans
  Of lamenting ghosts

  Alon I pulled a tree and blood pursued my hand
  Heaven deliver me from this dire place
  And all the afteractions of my life
  Shall mark my penitence and my bounty

  Hark the sounds approach us
                                   The stage opens in several places

  Anto Lo the earth opens to devour us quick
  These dreadful horrors and the guilty sense
  Of my foul treason have unmanned me quite

  Alon We on the brink of swift destruction stand
  No means of our escape is left
                          Another flourish of voices under the stage

  Anto Ah what amazing sounds are these we hear

  Gonz What horrid masque will the dire fiends present

  SUNG UNDER THE STAGE

         With the mischievous devil of Pride

   Dev In the lowest and darkest caverns of hell

   Dev Who are the chief leaders of the damned host

   Dev   Proud monarchs who tyrannize most

   Dev     Damned princes there
         The worst of torments bear

   Dev Who on earth all others in pleasures excel
            Must feel the worst torments of hell
                                         They rise singing this chorus

  Anto O heavens what horrid visions this
    How they upbraid us with our crimes

  Alon What fearful vengeance is in store for us

   Dev Tyrants by whom their subjects bleed
            Should in pains all others exceed

   Dev And barbarous monarchs who their neighbours invade
           And their crowns unjustly get
         And such who their brothers to death have betrayed
           In hell upon burning thrones shall be set

   Dev In hell in hell with flames they shall reign
  Chor  And for ever for ever shall suffer the pain

  Anto O my soul for ever for ever shall suffer the pain

  Alon Has heaven in all its infinite stock of mercy
    No overflowings for us poor miserable guilty men

  Gonz Nothing but horrors do encompass us
    For ever for ever must we suffer

  Alon For ever we shall perish O dismal words
  For ever

   Dev Who are the pillars of the tyrants court

   Dev Rapine and Murder his crown must support

   Dev His cruelty does tread
         On orphans tender breasts and brothers dead

   Dev Can heaven permit such crimes should be
             Attended with felicity

   Dev No tyrants their sceptres uneasily bear
         In the midst of their guards they their consciences fear

   Dev Care their minds when they wake unquiet will keep
  Chor  And we with dire visions disturb all their sleep

  Anto Oh horrid sight how they stare upon us
    The fiend will hurry us to the dark mansion
    Sweet heaven have mercy on us

  Enter MURDER

  Murder There long they could not stay
          Down the steep hill they run

  Anto Heaven has heard me they are vanished

  Alon But they have left me all unmanned
  I feel my sinews slacken with the fright
  And a cold sweat trills down oer all my limbs
  As if I were dissolving into water
  Oh Prospero my crimes against thee sit heavy on my heart

  Anto And mine against him and young Hippolito

  Anto Lead from this cursed ground
  The seas in all their rage are not so dreadful
  This is the region of despair and death

  Alon Beware all fruit but what the birds have pecked
  The shadows of the trees are poisonous too
  A secret venom slides from every branch
  My conscience does distract me O my son
  Why do I speak of eating or repose
  Before I know thy fortune

  And you who feed the flames by which earths entrails burn

  All but the fixed and solid centre shake
  Come drive these wretches to that part of the isle
  Where nature never yet did smile
  Cause fogs and storms whirlwinds and earthquakes there
  There let them howl and languish in despair
  Rise and obey the powerful prince of the air

  With charming airs Thence I have followed it
  Or it has drawn me rather but tis gone
  No it begins again

SCENE IIThe Cypress Trees and Cave

Enter PROSPERO and MIRANDA


  Prosp Excuse it not Miranda for to you
  The elder and I thought the more discreet
  I gave the conduct of your sisters actions

  Mir Sir when you called me thence I did not fail
  To mind her of her duty to depart

  Prosp How can I think you did remember hers
  When you forgot your own did you not see
  The man whom I commanded you to shun

  Mir I must confess I saw him at a distance

  Prosp Did not his eyes infect and poison you
  What alteration found you in yourself

  Mir I only wondered at a sight so new

  Prosp But have you no desire once more to see him
  Come tell me truly what you think of him

  Mir As of the gayest thing I ever saw
  So fine that it appeared more fit to be
  Beloved than feared and seemed so near my kind
  That I did think I might have called it sister

  Prosp You do not love it

  Mir How is it likely that I should
  Except the thing had first loved me

  Prosp Cherish those thoughts You have a generous soul
  And since I see your mind not apt to take
  The light impressions of a sudden love
  I will unfold a secret to your knowledge
  That creature which you saw is of a kind
  Which nature made a prop and guide to yours

  Mir Why did you then propose him as an object
  Of terror to my mind You never used
  To teach me any thing but godlike truths
  And what you said I did believe as sacred

  Prosp I feared the pleasing form of this young man
  Might unawares possess your tender breast
  Which for a nobler guest I had designed
  For shortly my Miranda you shall see
  Another of this kind the full blown flower
  Of which this youth was but the opening bud
  Go in and send your sister to me

  Mir Heaven still preserve you sir
                                                            Exit MIR

  Prosp And make thee fortunate

Enter DORINDA

  Oh come hither you have seen a man today
  Against my strict command

  Dor Who I Indeed I saw him but a little sir

  Prosp Come come be clear Your sister told me all

  Dor Did she
  Truly she would have seen him more than I
  But that I would not let her

  Prosp Why so

  Dor Because methought he would have hurt me less
  Than he would her
  But if I knew youd not be angry with me
  I could tell you sir that he was much to blame

  Prosp Ha was he to blame
  Tell me with that sincerity I taught you
  How you became so bold to see the man

  Dor I hope you will forgive me sir because
  I did not see him much till he saw me
  Sir he would needs come in my way and stared
  And stared upon my face and so I thought
  I would be revenged of him and therefore
  I gazed on him as long but if I eer
  Come near a man again

  Prosp I told you he
  Was dangerous but you would not be warned

  Dor Pray be not angry sir if I tell you
  You are mistaken in him for he did
  Me no great hurt

  Prosp But he may do you more harm hereafter

  Dor No sir Im as well as eer I was in all my life
  But that I cannot eat nor drink for thought of him
  That dangerous man runs ever in my mind

  Prosp The way to cure you is no more to see him

  Dor Nay pray sir say not so I promised him
  To see him once again and you know sir
  You charged me I should never break my promise

  Prosp Would you see him who did you so much mischief

  Dor I warrant you
  I did him as much harm as he did me
  For when I left him sir he sighed so as it grieved
  My heart to hear him

  Prosp Those sighs were poisonous they infected you
  You say they grieved you to the heart

  Dor Tis true but yet his looks and words were gentle

  Prosp These are the daydreams of a maid in love
  But still I fear the worst

  Dor O fear not him sir

  Prosp You speak of him with too much passion tell me
  And on your duty tell me true Dorinda
  What passed betwixt you and that horrid creature

  Dor How horrid sir if any else but you
  Should call it so indeed I should be angry

  Prosp Go to You are a foolish girl but answer
  To what I ask what thought you when you saw it

  Dor At first it stared upon me and seemed wild
  And then I trembled yet it looked so lovely
  That when I would have fled away my feet
  Seemed fastened to the ground when it drew near
  And with amazement asked to touch my hand
  Which as a ransom for my life I gave
  But when he had it with a furious gripe
  He put it to his mouth so eagerly
  I was afraid he would have swallowed it

  Prosp Well what was his behaviour afterwards

  Dor He on a sudden grew so tame and gentle
  That he became more kind to me than you are
  Then sir I grew I know not how and touching
  His hand again my heart did beat so strong
  As I lacked breath to answer what he asked

  Prosp Youve been too fond and I should chide you for it

  Dor Then send me to that creature to be punished

  Prosp Poor child Thy passion like a lazy ague
  Has seized thy blood instead of striving thou humourest
  And feedst thy languishing disease Thou fightst
  The battles of thy enemy and tis one part of what
  I threatened thee not to perceive thy danger

  Dor Danger sir
  If he would hurt me yet he knows not how
  He hath no claws nor teeth nor horns to hurt me
  But looks about him like a callowbird
  Just straggling from the nest Pray trust me sir
  To go to him again

  Prosp Since you will venture
  I charge you bear yourself reservedly to him
  Let him not dare to touch your naked hand
  But keep at distance from him

  Dor This is hard

  Prosp It is the way to make him love you more
  He will despise you if you grow too kind

  Dor Ill struggle with my heart to follow this
  But if I lose him by it will you promise
  To bring him back again

  Prosp Fear not Dorinda
  But use him ill and hell be yours for ever

  Dor I hope you have not cozened me again
                                                            Exit DOR


  Prosp Now my designs are gathering to a head

  Ariel What would my potent master Here I am

  Prosp Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service
  Did worthily perform and I must use you

  Ariel On the fourth my lord and on the sixth
  You said our work should cease

  Prosp And so it shall
  And thou shalt have the open air at freedom

  Ariel Thanks my great lord

  Prosp But tell me first my spirit
  How fares the duke my brother and their followers

  Ariel Confined together as you gave me order
  In the limegrove which weatherfends your cell
  Within that circuit up and down they wander
  But cannot stir one step beyond their compass

  Prosp How do they bear their sorrows

  Ariel The two dukes appear like men distracted their
  Attendants brimfull of sorrow mourning over them
  But chiefly he you termed the good Gonzalo
  His tears run down his beard like winter drops
  From eaves of reeds your vision did so work them
  That if you now beheld them your affections
  Would become tender

  Prosp Dost thou think so spirit

  Ariel Mine would sir were I human

  Prosp And mine shall
  Hast thou who art but air a touch a feeling
  Of their afflictions and shall not I a man
  Like them one who as sharply relish passions
  As they be kindlier moved than thou art
  Though they have pierced me to the quick with injuries
  Yet with my nobler reason gainst my fury
  I will take part the rarer action is
  In virtue than in vengeance Go my Ariel
  Refresh with needful food their famished bodies
  With shows and chearful musick comfort them

  Ariel Presently master

  Prosp With a twinkle ArielBut stay my spirit
  What is become of my slave Caliban
  And Sycorax his sister

  Ariel Potent sir
  They have cast off your service and revolted
  To the wrecked mariners who have already
  Parcelled your island into governments

  Prosp No matter I have now no need of them
  But spirit now I stay thee on the wing
  Haste to perform what I have given in charge
  But see they keep within the bounds I set them

  Ariel Ill keep them in with walls of adamant
  Invisible as air to mortal eyes
  But yet unpassable

  Prosp Make haste then
                                                    Exeunt severally

  Alon If both resolve I will adventure too

  Gonz The devil may fright me yet he shall not starve me
                    Two Spirits descend and fly away with the table

  Alon Heaven behold it is as you suspected
  Tis vanished
  Shall we be always haunted with these fiends

  Anto Here we shall wander till we famish

  on it when men will be godly out of season

  Anto Yonders another table lets try that

  A slave to chance that Im as weary of
  Her flatteries as her frowns but here I am

  Ariel Here I am

  Ferd Ha art thou so the spirits turned an echo
  This might seem pleasant could the burden of
  My griefs accord with any thing but sighs
  And my last words like those of dying men
  Need no reply Fain I would go to shades
  Where few would wish to follow me

  Ariel Follow me

  Ferd This evil spirit grows importunate
  But Ill not take his counsel

  Ariel Take his counsel

  Ferd It may be the devils counsel Ill never take it

  Ariel Take it

  Ferd I will discourse no more with thee
  Nor follow one step further

  Some spirit tempts me to a precipice
  Ill try if it will answer when I sing
  My sorrows to the murmur of this brook

  Ferd           Why shouldst thou stay

  Ariel          Why shouldst thou stay

  Ferd  Where the winds whistle and where the streams creep
         Under yon willowtree fain would I sleep

  Ferd  What cares or pleasures can be in this isle

  Lord how it looks about Sir I confess
  it carries a brave form But tis a spirit

  Prosp No girl it eats and sleeps and has such senses
  As we have This young gallant whom thou seest
  Was in the wreck were he not somewhat stained
  With grief beautys worst canker thou mightst call him
  A goodly person he has lost his company
  And strays about to find them

  Mir I might call him
  A thing divine for nothing natural
  I ever saw so noble

  Prosp It goes on
  As my soul prompts it Spirit fine spirit
  Ill free thee within two days for this
                                                               Aside

  Ferd Shes sure the mistress on whom these airs attend
  Fair excellence if as your form declares
  You are divine be pleased to instruct me how
  You will be worshipped so bright a beauty
  Cannot sure belong to human kind

  Mir I am like you a mortal if such you are

  Ferd My language too O heavens I am the best
  Of them who speak this speech when Im in my
  Own country

  Prosp How the best what wert thou if
  The duke of Savoy heard thee

  Ferd As I am now
  Who wonders to hear thee speak of Savoy
  He does hear me and that he does I weep
  Myself am Savoy whose fatal eyes neer since at ebb beheld
  The duke my father wrecked

  Mir Alack for pity

  Prosp At the first sight they have changed eyes
  Dear Ariel Ill set thee free for this
                                                               Aside
  Young sir a word

  Mir Why speaks my father so ungently This is
  The third man that I ever saw the first
  Whom eer I sighed for sweet heaven move my father
  To be inclined my way

  Ferd O if a virgin
  And your affections not gone forth Ill make you
  Mistress of Savoy

  Prosp Soft sir one word more
  Theyre in each others power but this swift business
  I must uneasy make lest too light winning
  Make the prize lightOne word more Thou usurpst
  The name not due to thee hast put thyself
  Upon this island as a spy to get
  The government from me the lord of it

  Ferd No as Im a man

  Mir Theres nothing ill can dwell in such a temple
  If the evil spirit hath so fair a house
  Good things will strive to dwell with it

  Prosp No more Speak not for him he is a traitor
  Come thou art my prisoner and shalt be in bonds
  Seawater shalt thou drink thy food shall be

  Till my enemy has more power
                                He draws and is charmed from moving

  Mir O dear father make not too rash a trial
  Of him for he is gentle and not fearful

  Prosp My child my tutor put thy sword up
  Traitor who makst a show but darst not strike
  Thy conscience is possessed with guilt
  Come from thy ward
  For I can here disarm thee with this wand
  And make thy weapon drop

  Mir Beseech you father

  Prosp Hence Hang not on my garment

  Mir Sir have pity
  Ill be his surety

  Prosp Silence one word more
  Shall make me chide thee if not hate thee What
  An advocate for an impostor sure
  Thou thinkst there are no more such shapes as his
  To the most of men this is a Caliban
  And they to him are angels

  Mir My affections are then most humble
  I have no ambition to see a goodlier man

  Prosp Come on obey
  Thy nerves are in their infancy again
  And have no vigour in them

  Ferd So they are
  My spirits as in a dream are all bound up
  My fathers loss the weakness which I feel
  The wreck of all my friends and this mans threats
  To whom I am subdued would seem light to me
  Might I but once a day thorough my prison
  Behold this maid All corners else o the earth
  Let liberty make use of I have space
  Enough in such a prison

  Prosp It works Come on
  Thou hast done well fine Ariel Follow me
  Hark what thou shalt do for me

  Mir Be of comfort
  My fathers of a better nature sir
  Than he appears by speech This is unwonted
  Which now came from him

  Prosp Thou shalt be free as mountain winds
  But then
  Exactly do all points of my command

  Ariel To a syllable

  Ferd As soon thou mayst divide the waters when
  Thou strikst em which pursue thy bootless blow
  And meet when it is past

  Prosp Go practise your philosophy within
  And if you are the same you speak yourself
  Bear your afflictions like a princeThat door
  Shews you your lodging

  Ferd Tis in vain to strive I must obey

  Prosp This goes as I would wish it
  Now for my second care Hippolito
  I shall not need to chide him for his fault
  His passion is become his punishment
  Come forth Hippolito

Enter HIPPOLITO

  Hip Tis Prosperos voice

  Prosp Hippolito I know you now expect
  I should severely chide you You have seen
  A woman in contempt of my commands

  Hip But sir you see I am come off unharmed
  I told you that you need not doubt my courage

  Prosp You think you have received no hurt

  Hip No none sir
  Try me again wheneer you please Im ready
  I think I cannot fear an army of them

  Prosp How much in vain it is to bridle nature
                                                               Aside
  Well what was the success of your encounter

  Hip Sir we had none we yielded both at first
  For I took her to mercy and she me

  Prosp But are you not much changed from what you were

  Hip Methinks I wish and wishfor what I know not
  But still I wishYet if I had that woman
  She I believe could tell me what I wish for

  Prosp What would you do to make that woman yours

  Hip Id quit the rest othe world that I might live
  Alone with her she never should be from me
  We two would sit and look till our eyes ached

  Prosp Youd soon be weary of her

  Hip O sir never

  Prosp But youll grow old and wrinkled as you see
  Me now and then you will not care for her

  Hip You may do what you please but sir we two
  Can never possibly grow old

  Prosp You must Hippolito

  Hip Whether we will or no sir who shall make us

  Prosp Nature which made me so

  Hip But you have told me that her works are various
  She made you old but she has made us young

  Prosp Time will convince you
  Meanwhile be sure you tread in honours paths
  That you may merit her And that you may not
  Want fit occasions to employ your virtue
  In this next cave there is a stranger lodged
  One of your kind young of a noble presence
  And as he says himself of princely birth
  He is my prisoner and in deep affliction
  Visit and comfort him it will become you

  Hip It is my duty sir
                                                            Exit HIP

  Prosp True he has seen a woman yet he lives
  Perhaps I took the moment of his birth
  Amiss Perhaps my art itself is false
  On what strange grounds we build our hopes and fears
  Mans life is all a mist and in the dark
  Our fortunes meet us
  If fate be not then what can we foresee
  Or how can we avoid it if it be
  If by free will in our own paths we move
  How are we bounded by decrees above
  Whether we drive or whether we are driven
  If ill tis ours if good the act of heaven
                                                                Exit

  Ferd Your pity noble youth doth much oblige me
  Indeed twas sad to lose a father so

  Hip Ay and an only father too for sure
  You said you had but one

  Ferd But one father Hes wondrous simple
                                                               Aside

  Hip Are such misfortunes frequent in your world
  Where many men live

  Ferd Such are we born to
  But gentle youth as you have questioned me
  So give me leave to ask you what you are

  Hip Do not you know

  Ferd How should I

  Hip I well hoped
  I was a man but by your ignorance
  Of what I am I fear it is not so
  Well Prospero this is now the second time
  You have deceived me

  Ferd Sir there is no doubt
  You are a man But I would know of whence

  Hip Why of this world I never was in yours

  Ferd Have you a father

  Hip I was told I had one
  And that he was a man yet I have been
  So much deceived I dare not tellt you for
  A truth But I have still been kept a prisoner
  For fear of women

  Ferd They indeed are dangerous
  For since I came I have beheld one here
  Whose beauty pierced my heart

  Hip How did she pierce You seem not hurt

  Ferd Alas the wound was made by her bright eyes
  And festers by her absence
  But to speak plainer to you sir I love her

  Hip Now I suspect that loves the very thing
  That I feel tooPray tell me truly sir
  Are you not grown unquiet since you saw her

  Ferd I take no rest

  Hip Just just my disease
  Do you not wish you do not know for what

  Ferd O no I know too well for what I wish

  Hip There I confess I differ from you sir
  But you desire she may be always with you

  Ferd I can have no felicity without her

  Hip Just my conditionAlas gentle sir
  Ill pity you and you shall pity me

  Ferd I love so much that if I have her not
  I find I cannot live

  Hip How do you love her
  And would you have her too That must not be
  For none but I must have her

  Ferd But perhaps we do not love the same
  All beauties are not pleasing alike to all

  Hip Why are there more fair women sir
  Besides that one I love

  Ferd Thats a strange question There are many more
  Besides that beauty which you love

  Hip I will have all
  Of that kind if there be a hundred of them

  Ferd But noble youth you know not what you say

  Hip Sir they are things I love I cannot be
  Without themO how I rejoiceMore women

  Ferd Sir if you love you must be tied to one

  Hip Tied How tied to her

  Ferd To love none but her

  Hip But sir I find it is against my nature
  I must love where I like and I believe I may like all
  All that are fair Come bring me to this woman
  For I must have her

  Ferd His simplicity
  Is such that I can scarce be angry with him
                                                               Aside
  Perhaps sweet youth when you behold her you
  Will find you do not love her

  Hip I find already
  I love because she is another woman

  Ferd You cannot love two women both at once

  Hip Sure tis my duty to love all who do
  Resemble her whom Ive already seen
  Ill have as many as I can that are
  So good and angellike as she I love
  And will have yours

  Ferd Pretty youth you cannot

  Hip I can do any thing for that I love

  Ferd I may perhaps by force restrain you from it

  Hip Why do so if you can But either promise me
  To love no woman or you must try your force

  Ferd I cannot help it I must love

  Hip Well you may love
  For Prospero taught me friendship too You shall
  Love me and other men if you can find them
  But all the angel women shall be mine

  Ferd I must break off this conference or he
  Will urge me else beyond what I can bear
                                                               Aside
  Sweet youth some other time we will speak
  Farther concerning both our loves at present
  I am indisposed with weariness and grief
  And would if youre so pleased retire a while

  Hip Some other time be it but sir remember
  That I both seek and much entreat your friendship
  For next to women I find I can love you

  Ferd I thank you sir I will consider of it
                                                           Exit FERD

  Hip This stranger does insult and comes into
  My world to take those heavenly beauties from me
  Which I believe I am inspired to love
  And yet he said he did desire but one
  He would be poor in love but Ill be rich
  I now perceive that Prospero was cunning
  For when he frightened me from womankind
  Those precious things he for himself designed
                                                                Exit

ACT IV SCENE I


Cypress trees and a Cave

Enter PROSPERO and MIRANDA

  Prosp Your suit has pity int and has prevailed
  Within this cave he lies and you may see him
  But yet take heed let prudence be your guide
  You must not stay your visit must be short
                                                         Shes going
  One thing I had forgot insinuate into his mind
  A kindness to that youth whom first you saw
  I would have friendship grow betwixt them

  Mir You shall be obeyed in all things

  Prosp Be earnest to unite their very souls

  Mir I shall endeavour it

  Prosp This may secure
  Hippolito from that dark danger which
  My art forebodes for friendship does provide
  A double strength to oppose the assaults of fortune
                                                          Exit PROSP

Enter FERDINAND

  Ferd To be a prisoner where I dearly love
  Is but a double tie a link of fortune
  Joined to the chain of love but not to see her
  And yet to be so near her theres the hardship
  I feel myself as on a rack stretched out
  And nigh the ground on which I might have ease
  Yet cannot reach it

  Mir Sirmy lordwhere are you

  Ferd Is it your voice my love or do I dream

  Mir Speak softly it is I

  Ferd O heavenly creature
  Ten times more gentle than your fathers cruel
  How on a sudden all my griefs are vanished

  Mir How do you bear your prison

  Ferd Tis my palace
  While you are here and love and silence wait
  Upon our wishes do but think we chuse it
  And tis what we would chuse

  Mir Im sure what I would
  But how can I be certain that you love me
  Look tot for I will die when you are false
  Ive heard my father tell of maids who died
  And haunted their false lovers with their ghosts

  Ferd Your ghost must take another form to fright me
  This shape will be too pleasingDo I love you
  O heaven O earth bear witness to this sound
  If I prove false

  Mir O hold you shall not swear
  For heaven will hate you if you prove forsworn

  Ferd Did I not love I could no more endure
  This undeserved captivity than I
  Could wish to gain my freedom with the loss
  Of you

  Mir I am a fool to weep at what
  Im glad of But I have a suit to you
  And that sir shall
  Be now the only trial of your love

  Ferd Youve said enough never to be denied
  Were it my life for you have far oerbid
  The price of all that human life is worth

  Mir Sir tis to love one for my sake who for
  His own deserves all the respect which you
  Can ever pay him

  Ferd You mean your father Do not think his usage
  Can make me hate him when he gave you being
  He then did that which cancelled all these wrongs

  Mir I meant not him for that was a request
  Which if you love I should not need to urge

  Ferd Is there another whom I ought to love
  And love him for your sake

  Mir Yes such a one
  Who for his sweetness and his goodly shape
  If I who am unskilled in forms may judge
  I think can scarce be equalled Tis a youth
  A stranger too as you are

  Ferd Of such a graceful feature and must I
  For your sake love him

  Mir Yes sir Do you scruple
  To grant the first request I ever made
  Hes wholly unacquainted with the world
  And wants your conversation You should have
  Compassion on so mere a stranger

  Ferd Those need compassion whom you discommend
  Not whom you praise

  Mir Come you must love him for my sake
  You shall

  Ferd Must I for yours and cannot for my own
  Either you do not love or think that I dont
  But when you bid me love him I must hate him

  Mir Have I so far offended you already
  That he offends you only for my sake
  Yet sure you would not hate him if you saw
  Him as Ive done so full of youth and beauty

  Ferd O poison to my hopes
  When he did visit me and I did mention
  This beauteous creature to him he then did tell
  Me he would have her
                                                               Aside

  Mir Alas what mean you

  Ferd It is too plain Like most of her frail sex
  Shes false but has not learned the art to hide it
  Nature has done her part she loves variety
  Why did I think that any woman could
  Be innocent because shes young No no
  Their nurses teach them change when with two nipples
  They do divide their liking
                                                               Aside

  Mir I fear I have offended you and yet
  I meant no harm But if you please to hear me
                                                      A noise within
  Hark sir now I am sure my father comes
  I know his steps Dear love retire a while
  I fear Ive staid too long

  Ferd Too long indeed and yet not long enough
  Oh jealousy Oh love how you distract me
                                                           Exit FERD

  Mir He appears displeased with that young man I know
  Not why But till I find from whence his hate proceeds
  I must conceal it from my fathers knowledge
  For he will think that guiltless I have caused it
  And suffer me no more to see my love

Enter PROSPERO

  Prosp Now I have been indulgent to your wish
  You have seen the prisoner

  Mir Yes

  Prosp And he spoke to you

  Mir He spoke but he received short answers from me

  Prosp How like you his converse

  Mir At second sight
  A man does not appear so rare a creature

  Prosp I find she loves him much because she hides it
  Love teaches cunning even to innocence
                                                               Aside
  Well go in

  Mir Forgive me truth for thus disguising thee
  If I can make him think I do not love
  The stranger much hell let me see him oftener
                                                            Exit MIR

  Prosp Stay stayI had forgot to ask her
  What she has said of young Hippolito
  Oh here he comes and with him my Dorinda
  Ill not be seen let their loves grow in secret
                                                                Exit


SCENE II

Enter HIPPOLITO and DORINDA

  Hip But why are you so sad

  Dor But why are you so joyful

  Hip I have within me
  All all the various music of the woods
  Since last I saw you I have heard brave news
  I will tell you and make you joyful for me

  Dor Sir when I saw you first I through my eyes
  Drew something in I know not what it is
  But still it entertains me with such thoughts
  As make me doubtful whether joy becomes me

  Hip Pray believe me
  As Im a man Ill tell you blessed news
  Ive heard there are more women in the world
  As fair as you are too

  Dor Is this your news You see it moves not me

  Hip And I will have them all

  Hip Ill have you too
  But are not you acquainted with these women

  But pray wheres that one woman

  Dor Who my sister

  Hip Is she your sister Im glad of that You shall
  Help me to her and I will love you for it
                                             Offers to take her hand

  Dor Away I will not have you touch my hand
  My fathers counsel which enjoined reservedness
  Was not in vain I see
                                                               Aside

  Hip What makes you shun me

  Dor You need not care youll have my sisters hand

  Hip Why must not he who touches hers touch yours

  Dor You mean to love her too

  Hip Do not you love her
  Then why should I not do so

  Dor Shes my sister
  And therefore I must love her But you cannot
  Love both of us

  Hip I warrant you I can
  Oh that you had more sisters

  Dor You may love her
  But then Ill not love you

  Hip O but you must
  One is enough for you but not for me

  Dor My sister told me she had seen another
  A man like you and she liked only him
  Therefore if one must be enough for her
  He is that one and then you cannot have her

  Hip If she like him she may like both of us

  Dor But how if I should change and like that man
  Would you be willing to permit that change

  Hip No for you liked me first

  Dor So you did me

  Hip But I would never have you see that man
  I cannot bear it

  Dor Ill see neither of you

  Hip Yes me you may for we are now acquainted
  But hes the man of whom your father warned you
  O hes a terrible huge monstrous creature
  Im but a woman to him

  Dor I will see him
  Except youll promise not to see my sister

  Hip Yes for your sake I needs must see your sister

  Dor But shes a terrible huge creature too
  If I were not her sister she would eat me
  Therefore take heed

  Hip I heard that she was fair
  And like you

  Dor No indeed shes like my father
  With a great beard twould fright you to look on her
  Therefore that man and she may go together
  They are fit for nobody but one another

  Hip Looking in Yonder he comes with glaring eyes fly fly
  Before he sees you

  Dor Must we part so soon

  Hip Youre a lost woman if you see him

  Dor I would not willingly be lost for fear
  You should not find me Ill avoid him
                                                            Exit DOR

  Hip She fain would have deceived me but I know
  Her sister must be fair for shes a woman
  All of a kind that I have seen are like
  To one another All the creatures of
  The rivers and the woods are so

Enter FERDINAND

  Ferd O well encountered you are the happy man
  Youve got the hearts of both the beauteous women

  Hip How sir pray are you sure ont

  Ferd One of them charged me to love you for her sake

  Hip Then I must have her

  Ferd No not till I am dead

  Hip How dead whats thatBut whatsoeer it be
  I long to have her

  Ferd Time and my grief may make me die

  Hip But for a friend you should make haste I neer
  Asked any thing of you before

  Ferd I see your ignorance
  And therefore will instruct you in my meaning
  The woman whom I love saw you and loved you
  Now sir if you love her youll cause my death

  Hip Be sure Ill do it then

  Ferd But I am your friend
  And I request you that you would not love her

  Hip When friends request unreasonable things
  Sure theyre to be denied You say shes fair
  And I must love all who are fair for to tell you
  A secret sir which I have lately found
  Within myself theyre all made for me

  Ferd Thats but a fond conceit Youre made for one
  And one for you

  Hip You cannot tell me sir
  I know Im made for twenty hundred women
  I mean if there so many be ithe world
  So that if I once see her I shall love her

  Ferd Then do not see her

  Hip Yes sir I must see her
  For I would fain have my heart beat again
  Just as it did when I first saw her sister

  Ferd I find I must not let you see her then

  Hip How will you hinder me

  Ferd By force of arms

  Hip By force of arms
  My arms perhaps may be as strong as yours

  Ferd Hes still so ignorant that I pity him
  And fain would avoid force AsidePray do not see her
  She was mine first you have no right to her

  Hip I have not yet considered what is right
  But sir I know my inclinations are
  To love all women and I have been taught
  That to dissemble what I think is base
  In honour then of truth I must declare
  That I do love and I will see your woman

  Ferd Would you be willing I should see and love
  Your woman and endeavour to seduce her
  From that affection which she vowed to you

  Hip I would not you should do it but if she
  Should love you best I cannot hinder her
  But sir for fear she should I will provide
  Against the worst and try to get your woman

  Ferd But I pretend no claim at all to yours
  Besides you are more beautiful than I
  And fitter to allure unpractised hearts
  Therefore I once more beg you will not see her

  Hip Im glad you let me know I have such beauty
  If that will get me women they shall have it
  As far as ere twill go Ill never want them

  Ferd Then since you have refused this act of friendship
  Provide yourself a sword for we must fight

  Hip A sword whats that

  Ferd Why such a thing as this

  Hip What should I do with it

  Ferd You must stand thus
  And push against me while I push at you
  Till one of us fall dead

  Hip This is brave sport
  But we have no swords growing in our world

  Ferd What shall we do then to decide our quarrel

  Hip Well take the sword by turns and fight with it

  Ferd Strange ignorance AsideYou must defend your life
  And so must I But since you have no sword
  Take this Gives him his sword For in a corner of my cave
  I found a rusty one perhaps twas his
  Who keeps me prisner here That I will fit
  When next we meet prepare yourself to fight

  Hip Make haste then this shall neer be yours again
  I mean to fight with all the men I meet
  And when theyre dead their women shall be mine

  Ferd I see you are unskilful I desire not
  To take your life but if you please well fight
  On these conditions he who first draws blood
  Or who can take the others weapon from him
  Shall be acknowledged as the conqueror
  And both the women shall be his

  Hip Agreed
  And every day Ill fight for two more with you

  Ferd But win these first

  Hip Ill warrant you Ill push you
                                                    Exeunt severally

                                              HIP thrusts and falls

  Ferd O help help help
  Unhappy man what have I done

  Hip Im going to a cold sleep but when I wake
  Ill fight again Pray stay for me
                                                              Swoons

  Ferd Hes gone
  Hes gone O stay sweet lovely youth Help help

Enter PROSPERO

  Prosp What dismal noise is that

  Ferd O see sir see
  What mischief my unhappy hand has wrought

  Prosp Alas how much in vain doth feeble art
  Endeavour to resist the will of heaven
                                                            Rubs HIP
  Hes gone for ever O thou cruel son
  Of an inhuman father all my designs
  Are ruined and unravelled by this blow
  No pleasure now is left me but revenge

  Ferd Sir if you knew my innocence

  Prosp Peace peace
  Can thy excuses give me back his life
  What Ariel sluggish spirit where art thou

Enter ARIEL

  Ariel Here at thy beck my lord

  Prosp Ay now thou comest
  When fate is past and not to be recalled
  Look there and glut the malice of thy nature
  For as thou art thyself thou canst not but
  Be glad to see young virtue nipt i the blossom

  Ariel My lord the Being high above can witness
  I am not glad we airy spirits are not of
  A temper so malicious as the earthy
  But of a nature more approaching good
  For which we meet in swarms and often combat
  Betwixt the confines of the air and earth

  Prosp Why didst thou not prevent at least foretel
  This fatal action then

  Ariel Pardon great sir
  I meant to do it but I was forbidden
  By the ill genius of Hippolito
  Who came and threatened me if I disclosed it
  To bind me in the bottom of the sea
  Far from the lightsome regions of the air
  My native fields above a hundred years

  Prosp Ill chain thee in the north for thy neglect
  Within the burning bowels of Mount Hecla
  Ill singe thy airy wings with sulphrous flames
  And choke thy tender nostrils with blue smoke
  At evry hickup of the belching mountain
  Thou shalt be lifted up to taste fresh air
  And then fall down again

  Ariel Pardon dread lord

  Prosp No more of pardon than just heaven intends thee
  Shalt thou eer find from me Hence fly with speed
  Unbind the charms which hold this murderers father
  And bring him with my brother straight before me

  Ariel Mercy my potent lord and Ill outfly
  Thy thought
                                                          Exit ARIEL

  Ferd O heavens what words are these I heard
  Yet cannot see who spoke em Sure the woman
  Whom I loved was like this some airy vision

  Prosp No murderer shes like thee of mortal mould
  But much too pure to mix with thy black crimes
  Yet she has faults and must be punished for them
  Miranda and Dorinda where are ye
  The will of heavens accomplished I have now
  No more to fear and nothing left to hope
  Now you may enter

Enter MIRANDA and DORINDA

  Mir My love is it permitted me to see
  You once again

  Prosp You come to look your last
  I will for ever take him from your eyes
  But on my blessing speak not nor approach him

  Dor Pray father is not this my sisters man
  He has a noble form but yet hes not
  So excellent as my Hippolito

  Prosp Alas poor girl thou hast no man Look yonder
  Theres all of him thats left

  Dor Why was there ever any more of him
  He lies asleep sir shall I waken him
                             She kneels by HIPPOLITO and jogs him

  Ferd Alas hes never to be waked again

  Dor My love my love wilt thou not speak to me
  I fear you have displeased him sir and now
  He will not answer me hes dumb and cold too
  But Ill run straight and make a fire to warm him
                                             Exit DORINDA running

Enter ALONZO GONZALO ANTONIO and ARIEL invisible

  Alon Never were beasts so hunted into toils
  As we have been pursued by dreadful shapes
  But is not that my son O Ferdinand
  If thou art not a ghost let me embrace thee

  Ferd My father O sinister happiness
  Is it decreed I should recover you
  Alive just in that fatal hour when this
  Brave youth is lost in death and by my hand

  Ant Heaven what new wonders this

  Gonz This isle is full of nothing else

  Prosp You stare upon me as you neer had seen me
  Have fifteen years so lost me to your knowledge
  That you retain no memory of Prospero

  Gonz The good old duke of Milan

  Prosp I wonder less
  That thou Antonio knowest me not because
  Thou didst long since forget I was thy brother
  Else I had neer been here

  Ant Shame choaks my words

  Alonz And wonder mine

  Prosp For you usurping prince
                                                            To ALONZ
  Know by my art you were shipwrecked on this isle
  Where after I a while had punished you
  My vengeance would have ended I designed
  To match that son of yours with this my daughter

  Alonz Pursue it still I am most willing to it

  Prosp So am not I No marriages can prosper
  Which are with murderers made look on that corpse
  This whilst he lived was young Hippolito
  That infant duke of Mantua sir whom you
  Exposed with me and here I bred him up
  Till that bloodthirsty man that Ferdinand
  But why do I exclaim on him when justice
  Calls to unsheath her sword against his guilt

  Alonz What do you mean

  Prosp To execute heavens laws
  Here I am placed by heaven here I am prince
  Though you have dispossessed me of my Milan
  Blood calls for blood your Ferdinand shall die
  And I in bitterness have sent for you
  To have the sudden joy of seeing him alive
  And then the greater grief to see him die

  Alonz And thinkst thou I or these will tamely stand
  To view the execution
                                            Lays hand upon his sword

  Ferd Hold dear father
  I cannot suffer you to attempt against
  His life who gave her being whom I love

  Prosp Nay then appear my guardsI thought no more
  To use their aid Im cursed because I used it
                                  He stamps and many Spirits appear
  But they are now the ministers of heaven
  Whilst I revenge this murder

  Alonz Have I for this
  Found thee my son so soon again to lose thee
  Antonio Gonzalo speak for pity

  Ferd Adieu my fairest mistress
                                                              To MIR

  Mir Now I can hold no longer I must speak
  Though I am loth to disobey you sir
  Be not so cruel to the man I love
  Or be so kind to let me suffer with him

  Ferd Recall that prayer or I shall wish to live
  Though death be all the mends that I can make

  Prosp This night I will allow you Ferdinand
  To fit you for your death that caves your prison

  Alonz Ah Prospero hear me speak You are a father
  Look on my age and look upon his youth

  Prosp No more all you can say is urged in vain
  I have no room for pity left within me
  Do you refuse help Ariel with your fellows
  To drive them in Alonzo and his son
  Bestow in yonder cave and here Gonzalo
  Shall with Antonio lodge
                        Spirits drive them in as they are appointed

Enter DORINDA

  Dor Sir I have made a fire shall he be warmed

  Prosp Hes dead and vital warmth will neer return

  Dor Dead sir whats that

  Prosp His soul has left his body

  Dor When will it come again

  Prosp O never never
  He must be laid in earth and there consume

  Dor He shall not lie in earth you do not know
  How well he loves me Indeed hell come again
  He told me he would go a little while
  But promised me he would not tarry long

  Prosp Hes murdered by the man who loved your sister
  Now both of you may see what tis to break
  A fathers precept you would needs see man
  And by that sight are made for ever wretched
  Hippolito is dead and Ferdinand
  Must die for murdering him

  Mir Have you no pity

  Prosp Your disobedience has so much incensed me
  That I this night can leave no blessing with you
  Help to convey the body to my couch
  Then leave me to mourn over it alone
                                       They bear off the body of HIP

Enter MIRANDA and DORINDA again ARIEL behind them

  Ariel Ive been so chid for my neglect by Prospero
  That I must now watch all and be unseen

  Mir Sister I say again twas long of you
  That all this mischief happened

  Dor Blame not me
  For your own fault your curiosity
  Brought me to see the man

  Mir You safely might
  Have seen him and retired but you would needs
  Go near him and converse you may remember
  My father called me thence and I called you

  Dor That was your envy sister not your love
  You called me thence because you could not be
  Alone with him yourself but I am sure
  My man had never gone to heaven so soon
  But that yours made him go
                                                              Crying

  Mir Sister I could not wish that either of them
  Should go to heaven without us but it was
  His fortune and you must be satisfied

  Dor Ill not be satisfied My father says
  Hell make your man as cold as mine is now
  And when he is made cold my father will
  Not let you strive to make him warm again

  Mir In spite of you mine never shall be cold

  Dor Im sure twas he that made me miserable
  And I will be revenged Perhaps you think
  Tis nothing to lose a man

  Mir Yes but there is
  Some difference betwixt my Ferdinand
  And your Hippolito

  Dor Ay theres your judgment
  Yours is the oldest man I ever saw
  Except it were my father

  Mir Sister no more
  It is not comely in a daughter when
  She says her fathers old

  Dor But why do I
  Stay here whilst my cold love perhaps may want me
  Ill pray my father to make yours cold too

  Mir Sister Ill never sleep with you again

  Dor Ill never more meet in a bed with you
  But lodge on the bare ground and watch my love

  Mir And at the entrance of that cave Ill lie
  And echo to each blast of wind a sigh
             Exeunt severally looking discontentedly on one another

  Ariel Harsh discord reigns throughout this fatal isle
  At which good angels mourn ill spirits smile
  Old Prospero by his daughters robbed of rest
  Has in displeasure left them both unblest
  Unkindly they abjure each others bed
  To save the living and revenge the dead
  Alonzo and his son are prisoners made
  And good Gonzalo does their crimes upbraid
  Antonio and Gonzalo disagree
  And would though in one cave at distance be
  The seamen all that cursed wine have spent
  Which still renewed their thirst of government
  And wanting subjects for the food of power
  Each would to rule alone the rest devour
  The monsters Sycorax and Caliban
  More monstrous grow by passions learned from man
  Even I not framed of warring elements
  Partake and suffer in these discontents
  Why should a mortal by enchantments hold
  In chains a spirit of etherial mould
  Accursed magic we ourselves have taught
  And our own power has our subjections wrought
                                                                Exit




ACT V SCENE I


Enter PROSPERO and MIRANDA

  Prosp You beg in vain I cannot pardon him
  He has offended heaven

  Mir Then let heaven punish him

  Prosp It will by me

  Mir Grant him at least some respite for my sake

  Prosp I by deferring justice should incense
  The deity against myself and you

  Mir Yet I have heard you say the powers above
  Are slow in punishing and should not you
  Resemble them

  Prosp The argument is weak
  But I want time to let you see your errors
  Retire and if you love him pray for him
                                                          Hes going

  Mir And can you be his judge and executioner

  Prosp I cannot force Gonzalo or my brother
  Much less the father to destroy the son
  It must be then the monster Caliban
  And hes not here but Ariel strait shall fetch him

Enter ARIEL

  Ariel My potent lord before thou callest I come
  To serve thy will

  Prosp Then spirit fetch me here my savage slave

  Ariel My lord it does not need

  Prosp Art thou then prone to mischief wilt thou be
  Thyself the executioner

  Ariel Think better of thy airy minister
  Who for thy sake unbidden this night has flown
  Oer almost all the habitable world

  Prosp But to what purpose was all thy diligence

  Ariel When I was chidden by my mighty lord
  For my neglect of young Hippolito
  I went to view his body and soon found
  His soul was but retired not sallied out
  Then I collected
  The best of simples underneath the moon
  The best of balms and to the wound applied
  The healing juice of vulnerary herbs
  His only danger was his loss of blood
  But now hes waked my lord and just this hour
  He must be dressed again as I have done it
  Anoint the sword which pierced him with this weaponsalve
  and wrap it close from air till I have
  time to visit him again

  Prosp Thou art my faithful servant
  It shall be done be it your task Miranda
  Because your sister is not present here
  While I go visit your dear Ferdinand
  From whom I will a while conceal the news
  That it may be more welcome

  Mir I obey you
  And with a double duty sir For now
  You twice have given me life

  Prosp My Ariel follow me
                                                    Exeunt severally


SCENE II

HIPPOLITO discovered on a couch DORINDA by him

  Dor How do you find yourself

  Hip Im somewhat cold
  Can you not draw me nearer to the sun
  I am too weak to walk

  Dor My love Ill try
                          She draws the chair nearer to the audience
  I thought you never would have walked again
  They told me you were gone to heaven
  Have you been there

  Hip I know not where I was

  Dor I will not leave you till you promise me
  You will not die again

  Hip Indeed I will not

  Dor You must not go to heaven unless we go
  Together for I have heard my father say
  That we must strive to be each others guide
  The way to it will else be difficult
  Especially to those who are so young
  But I much wonder what it is to die

  Hip Sure tis to dream a kind of breathless sleep
  When once the souls gone out

  Dor What is the soul

  Hip A small blue thing that runs about within us

  Dor Then I have seen it in a frosty morning
  Run smoaking from my mouth

  Hip But dear Dorinda
  What is become of him who fought with me

  Dor O I can tell you joyful news of him
  My father means to make him die today
  For what he did to you

  Hip That must not be
  My dear Dorinda go and beg your father
  He may not die it was my fault he hurt me
  I urged him to it first

  Dor But if he live hell never leave killing you

  Hip O no I just remember when I fell asleep
  I heard him calling me a great way off
  And crying over me as you would do
  Besides we have no cause of quarrel now

  Dor Pray how began your difference first

  Hip I fought with him for all the women in the world

  Dor That hurt you had was justly sent from heaven
  For wishing to have any more but me

  Hip Indeed I think it was but I repent it
  The fault was only in my blood for now
  Tis gone I find I do not love so many

  Dor In confidence of this Ill beg my father
  That he may live Im glad the naughty blood
  That made you love so many is gone out

  Hip My dear go quickly lest you come too late
                                                            Exit DOR

Enter MIRANDA at the other door with HIPPOLITOS sword wrapt up

  Hip Whos this who looks so fair and beautiful
  As nothing but Dorinda can surpass her
  O I believe it is that angel woman
  Whom she calls sister

  Mir Sir I am sent hither
  To dress your wound how do you find your strength

  Hip Fair creature I am faint with loss of blood

  Mir I am sorry for it

  Hip Indeed and so am I
  For if I had that blood I then should find
  A great delight in loving you

  Mir But sir
  I am anothers and your love is given
  Already to my sister

  Hip Yet I find
  That if you please I can love still a little

  Mir I cannot be inconstant nor should you

  Hip O my wound pains me

  Mir I am come to ease you
                                               She unwraps the sword

  Hip Alas I feel the cold air come to me
  My wound shoots worse than ever
                                    She wipes and anoints the sword

  Mir Does it still grieve you

  Hip Now methinks theres something
  Laid just upon it

  Mir Do you find no ease

  Hip Yes yes upon the sudden all the pain
  Is leaving me Sweet heaven how I am eased

Enter FERDINAND and DORINDA to them

  Ferd to Dor Madam I must confess my life is yours
  I owe it to your generosity

  Dor I am overjoyed my father lets you live
  And proud of my good fortune that he gave
  Your life to me

  Mir How gave his life to her

  Hip Alas I think she said so and he said
  He owed it to her generosity

  Ferd But is not that your sister with Hippolito

  Dor So kind already

  Ferd I came to welcome life and I have met
  The cruellest of deaths

  Hip My dear Dorinda with another man

  Dor Sister what business have you here

  Mir You see I dress Hippolito

  Dor Youre very charitable to a stranger

  Mir You are not much behind in charity
  To beg a pardon for a man whom you
  Scarce ever saw before

  Dor Henceforward let your surgery alone
  For I had rather he should die than you
  Should cure his wound

  Mir And I wish Ferdinand had died before
  He owed his life to your entreaty

  Ferd to Hip Sir I am glad you are so well recovered
  You keep your humour still to have all women

  Hip Not all sir you except one of the number
  Your new love there Dorinda

  Mir Ah Ferdinand can you become inconstant
  If I must lose you I had rather death
  Should take you from me than you take yourself

  Ferd And if I might have chose I would have wished
  That death from Prospero and not this from you

  Dor Ay now I find why I was sent away
  That you might have my sisters company

  Hip Dorinda kill me not with your unkindness
  This is too much first to be false yourself
  And then accuse me too

  Ferd We all accuse
  Each other and each one denies their guilt
  I should be glad it were a mutual error
  And therefore first to clear myself from fault
  Madam I beg your pardon while I say
  I only love your sister
                                                              To DOR

  Mir O blest word
  Im sure I love no man but Ferdinand

  Dor Nor I heaven knows but my Hippolito

  Hip I never knew I loved so much before
  I feared Dorindas constancy but now
  I am convinced that I loved none but her
  Because none else can recompense her loss

  Ferd Twas happy then we had this little trial
  But how we all so much mistook I know not

  Mir I have only this to say in my defence
  My father sent me hither to attend
  The wounded stranger

  Dor And Hippolito
  Sent me to beg the life of Ferdinand

  Ferd From such small errors left at first unheeded
  Have often sprung sad accidents in love
  But see our fathers and our friends are come
  To mix their joys with ours

Enter PROSPERO ALONZO ANTONIO and GONZALO

  Alon to Prosp Let it no more be thought of
  Your purpose though it was severe was just
  In losing Ferdinand I should have mourned
  But could not have complained

  Pros Sir I am glad
  Kind heaven decreed it otherwise

  Dor O wonder
  How many goodly creatures are there here
  How beauteous mankind is

  Hip O brave new world
  That has such people int

  Alon to Ferd Now all the blessings
  Of a glad father compass thee about
  And make thee happy in thy beauteous choice

  Gonz Ive inward wept or should have spoken ere this
  Look down sweet heaven and on this couple drop
  A blessed crown for it is you chalked out
  The way which brought us hither

  Anto Though penitence
  Forced by necessity can scarce seem real
  Yet dearest brother I have hope my blood
  May plead for pardon with you I resign
  Dominion which tis true I could not keep
  But heaven knows too I would not

  Prosp All past crimes
  I bury in the joy of this blessed day

  Alon And that I may not be behind in justice
  To this young prince I render back his dukedom
  And as the duke of Mantua thus salute him

  Hip What is it that you render back methinks
  You give me nothing

  Prosp You are to be lord
  Of a great people and oer towns and cities

  Hip And shall these people be all men and women

  Gonz Yes and shall call you lord

  Hip Why then Ill live no longer in a prison
  But have a whole cave to myself hereafter

  Prosp And that your happiness may be complete
  I give you my Dorinda for your wife
  She shall be yours for ever when the priest
  Has made you one

  Hip How can he make us one Shall I grow to her

  Prosp By saying holy words you shall be joined
  In marriage to each other

  Dor I warrant you those holy words are charms
  My father means to conjure us together

  Prosp My Ariel told me when last night you quarrelled
                                                    To his daughters
  You said you would for ever part your beds
  But what you threatened in your anger heaven
  Has turned to prophecy
  For you Miranda must with Ferdinand
  And you Dorinda with Hippolito
  Lie in one bed hereafter

  Alon And heaven make
  Those beds still fruitful in producing children
  To bless their parents youth and grandsires age

  Mir to Dor If children come by lying in a bed
  I wonder you and I had none between us

  Dor Sister it was our fault we meant like fools
  To look em in the fields and they it seems
  Are only found in beds

  Hip I am oerjoyed
  That I shall have Dorinda in a bed
  Well lie all night and day together there
  And never rise again

  Ferd Aside to him Hippolito You yet
  Are ignorant of your great happiness
  But there is something which for your own and fair
  Dorindas sake I must instruct you in

  Hip Pray teach me quickly
  How men and women in your world make love
  I shall soon learn I warrant you

Enter ARIEL driving in STEPHANO TRINCALO MUSTACHO VENTOSO
CALIBAN and SYCORAX

  Prosp Why thats my dainty Ariel I shall miss thee
  But yet thou shalt have freedom

  Gonz O look sir look The master and the sailors
  The boatswain toomy prophecy is out
  That if a gallows were on land that man
  Could neer be drowned

  Alon Now blasphemy what not one oath ashore
  Hast thou no mouth by land Why starest thou so
                                                         To TRINCALO

  Trinc What more dukes yet I must resign my dukedom
  But tis no matter I was almost starved int

  Our gallant ship again and were her master
  Id willingly give all my island for her

  Vent And I my viceroyship

  Trinc I shall need no hangman for I shall even
  hang myself now my friend Butt has shed his last
  drop of life Poor Butt is quite departed

  Anto They talk like madmen

  Prosp No matter time will bring em to themselves
  And now their wine is gone they will not quarrel
  Your ship is safe and tight and bravely rigged
  As when you first set sail

  Alon This news is wonderful

  Ariel Was it well done my lord

  Prosp Rarely my diligence

  Gonz But pray sir what are those misshapen creatures

  Prosp Their mother was a witch and one so strong
  She would controul the moon make flows and ebbs
  And deal in her command without her power

  Syc O Setebos these be brave spirits indeed

  Prosp Go sirrah to my cell and as you hope
  For pardon trim it up
                                                            To CALIB

  Calib Most carefully I will be wise hereafter
  What a dull fool was I to take those drunkards
  For gods when such as these were in the world

  Prosp Sir I invite your highness and your train
  To my poor cave this night a part of which
  I will employ in telling you my story

  Alon No doubt it must be strangely taking sir

  Prosp When the morn draws Ill bring you to your ship
  And promise you calm seas and happy gales
  My Ariel thats thy charge Then to the elements
  Be free and fare thee well

  Ariel Ill do it master

  Prosp Now to make amends
  For the rough treatment you have found today
  Ill entertain you with my magic art
  Ill by my power transform this place and call
  Up those that shall make good my promise to you


SCENE IIChanges to the Rocks with the arch of Rocks and calm Sea
Music playing on the Rocks

  Prosp Neptune and your fair Amphitrite rise
  Oceanus with your Tethys too appear
  All ye seagods and goddesses appear
  Come all ye Tritons all ye Nereids come
  And teach your saucy element to obey
  For you have princes now to entertain
  And unsoiled beauties with fresh youthful lovers

NEPTUNE AMPHITRITE OCEANUS and TETHYS appear in a Chariot drawn
with Seahorses on each side of the Chariot SeaGods and Goddesses
Tritons and Nereids

  Alon This is prodigious

  Anto Ah what amazing objects do we see

  Gonz This art doth much exceed all human skill


  SONG

  Amph    My lord great Neptune for my sake
           Of these bright beauties pity take
                 And to the rest allow
                   Your mercy too
           Let this enraged element be still
             Let olus obey my will
           Let him his boisterous prisoners safely keep
             In their dark caverns and no more
           Let them disturb the bosom of the deep
             Till these arrive upon their wishedfor shore

  Nept    So much my Amphitrites love I prize
           That no commands of hers I can despise
             Tethys no furrows now shall wear
           Oceanus no wrinkles on his brow
             Let your serenest looks appear
           Be calm and gentle now

  Nept and Amph
          Be calm ye great parents of the floods and the springs
          While each Nereid and Triton plays revels and sings

  Ocean   Confine the roaring winds and we
            Will soon obey you cheerfully

  Chorus of Trit  Ner
         Tie up the winds and well obey
         Upon the floods well sing and play
         And celebrate a Halcyon day

           Here the Dancers mingle with the Singers and perform a dance

  Nept    Great nephew olus make no noise
           Muzzle your roaring boys                    OLUS appears

  Amph    Let em not bluster to disturb our ears
           Or strike these noble passengers with fears

  Nept    Afford em only such an easy gale
           As pleasantly may swell each sail

  Amph    While fell seamonsters cause intestine jars
           This empire you invade by foreign wars

  Nept    But you shall now be still
           And shall obey my Amphitrites will

  olus descends
         You Ill obey who at one stroke can make
         With your dread trident the whole earth to quake
          Come down my blusterers swell no more
           Your stormy rage give oer
                                      Winds from the four corners appear

           Let all black tempests cease
             And let the troubled ocean rest
           Let all the sea enjoy as calm a peace
             As where the halcyon builds her quiet nest
               To your prisons below
               Down down you must go
           You in the earths entrails your revels may keep
           But no more till I call shall you trouble the deep
                                                          Winds fly down
           Now they are gone all stormy wars shall cease
           Then let your trumpeters proclaim a peace

  Amph    Tritons my sons your trumpets sound
           And let the noise from neighbouring shores rebound

  Chorus Sound a calm
          Sound a calm
          Sound a calm
                a calm
          Sound a calm

Here the Tritons at every repeat of Sound a calm changing their
figure and postures seem to sound their wreathed trumpets made of
shells

A symphony of music like trumpets to which four
Tritons dance

  Nept    See see the heavens smile all your troubles are past
           Your joys by black clouds shall no more be oercast

  Amph    On this barren isle ye shall lose all your fears
           Leave behind all your sorrows and banish your cares

  Both   And your loves and your lives shall in safety enjoy
          No influence of stars shall your quiet destroy

  Chorus of all
          And your loves c
          No influence c
                                Here the Dancers mingle with the Singers

  Ocean   Well safely convey you to your own happy shore
           And yours and your countrys soft peace will restore

  Tethys  To treat you blest lovers as you sail on the deep
           The Tritons and seanymphs their revels shall keep

  Both   On the swift dolphins backs they shall sing and shall play
          They shall guard you by night and delight you by day

  Chorus of all
          On the swift c
          And shall guard c

                                               A dance of twelve Tritons

  Mir What charming things are these

  Dor What heavenly power is this

  Prosp Now my Ariel be visible
  And let the rest of your arial train
  Appear and entertain them with a song
  And then farewell my longloved Ariel


SCENE IIIChanges to the Rising Sun and a number of Arial Spirits
in the Air ARIEL flying from the Sun advances towards the Pit

  Alon Heaven What are these we see

  Prosp They are spirits with which the air abounds
  In swarms but that they are not subject
  To poor feeble mortal eyes

  Anto O wondrous skill

  Gonz O power divine

  ARIEL and the rest sing the following Song

    Where the bee sucks there suck I
    In a cowslips bed I lie
    There I couch when owls do cry
    On the swallows wings I fly
    After summer merrily
  Merrily merrily shall I live now
  Under the blossom that hangs on the bough

  Song ended ARIEL speaks hovering in the air

  Ariel My noble master
  May theirs and your blest joys never impair
  And for the freedom I enjoy in air
  I will be still your Ariel and wait
  On airy accidents that work for fate
  Whatever shall your happiness concern
  From your still faithful Ariel you shall learn

  Prosp Thou hast been always diligent and kind
  Farewell my longloved Ariel thou shalt find
  I will preserve thee ever in my mind
  Henceforth this isle to the afflicted be
  A place of refuge as it was to me
  The promises of blooming spring live here
  And all the blessings of the ripening year
  On my retreat let heaven and nature smile
  And ever flourish the Enchanted Isle

EPILOGUE


  Gallants by all good signs it does appear
  That sixtysevens a very damning year
  For knaves abroad and for ill poets here

  Among the muses theres a general rot
  The rhiming monsieur and the Spanish plot
  Defy or court alls one they go to pot

  The ghosts of poets walk within this place
  And haunt us actors wheresoeer we pass
  In visions bloodier than King Richards was

  For this poor wretch he has not much to say
  But quietly brings in his part oth play
  And begs the favour to be damned today

  He sends me only like a sheriffs man here
  To let you know the malefactors near
  And that he means to die en cavalier

  For if you should be gracious to his pen
  The example will prove ill to other men
  And youll be troubled with them all again

  COMEDY




  TO HIS GRACE
  WILLIAM
  DUKE OF NEWCASTLEG

  ONE OF HIS MAJESTYS
  MOST HONOURABLE PRIVY COUNCIL AND OF THE
  MOST NOBLE ORDER OF THE GARTER c

                                   

MAY IT PLEASE YOUR GRACE

Amongst those few persons of wit and honour whose favourable opinion I
have desired your own virtue and my great obligations to your grace
have justly given you the precedence For what could be more glorious to
me than to have acquired some part of your esteem who are admired and
honoured by all good men who have been for so many years together
the pattern and standard of honour to the nation and whose whole life
has been so great an example of heroic virtue that we might wonder how
it happened into an age so corrupt as ours if it had not likewise been
a part of the former As you came into the world with all the advantages
of a noble birth and education so you have rendered both yet more
conspicuous by your virtue Fortune indeed has perpetually crowned
your undertakings with success but she has only waited on your valour
not conducted it She has ministered to your glory like a slave and has
been led in triumph by it or at most while honour led you by the hand
to greatness fortune only followed to keep you from sliding back in the
ascent That which Plutarch accounted her favour to Cymon and Lucullus
was but her justice to your grace and never to have been overcome
where you led in person as it was more than Hannibal could boast so it
was all that Providence could do for that party which it had resolved
to ruin Thus my lord the last smiles of victory were on your arms
and everywhere else declaring for the rebels she seemed to suspend
herself and to doubt before she took her flight whether she were able
wholly to abandon that cause for which you foughtH

But the greatest trials of your courage and constancy were yet to come
Many had ventured their fortunes and exposed their lives to the utmost
dangers for their king and country who ended their loyalty with the
war and submitting to the iniquity of the times chose rather to
redeem their former plenty by acknowledging an usurper than to suffer
with an unprofitable fidelity as those meaner spirits called it for
their lawful sovereign But as I dare not accuse so many of our
nobility who were content to accept their patrimonies from the clemency
of the conqueror and to retain only a secret veneration for their
prince amidst the open worship which they were forced to pay to the
usurper who had dethroned him so I hope I may have leave to extol
that virtue which acted more generously and which was not satisfied
with an inward devotion to monarchy but produced itself to view and
asserted the cause by open martyrdom Of these rare patterns of loyalty
your grace was chief Those examples you could not find you made Some
few Catos there were with you whose invincible resolution could not be
conquered by that usurping Csar Your virtue opposed itself to his
fortune and overcame it by not submitting to it The last and most
difficult enterprize he had to effect when he had conquered three
nations was to subdue your spirit and he died weary of that war and
unable to finish it

In the mean time you lived more happily in your exile than the other
on his throne Your loyalty made you friends and servants amongst
foreigners and you lived plentifully without a fortune for you lived
on your own desert and reputation The glorious name of the valiant and
faithful Newcastle was a patrimony which could never be exhausted

Thus my lord the morning of your life was clear and calm and though
it was afterwards overcast yet in that general storm you were never
without a shelter And now you are happily arrived to the evening of a
day as serene as the dawn of it was glorious but such an evening as I
hope and almost prophecy is far from night Tis the evening of a
summers sun which keeps the daylight long within the skies The
health of your body is maintained by the vigour of your mind Neither
does the one shrink from the fatigue of exercise nor the other bend
under the pains of study Methinks I behold in you another Caius
Marius who in the extremity of his age exercised himself almost every
morning in the Campus Martius amongst the youthful nobility of Rome
And afterwards in your retirements when you do honour to poetry by
employing part of your leisure in it I regard you as another Silius
Italicus who having passed over his consulship with applause
dismissed himself from business and from the gown and employed his
age amongst the shades in the reading and imitation of Virgil

In which lest any thing should be wanting to your happiness you have
by a rare effect of fortune found in the person of your excellent
lady not only a lover but a partner of your studies a lady whom our
age may justly equal with the Sappho of the Greeks or the Sulpitia of
the Romans who by being taken into your bosom seems to be inspired
with your genius and by writing the history of your lifeI in so
masculine a style has already placed you in the number of the heroes
She has anticipated that great portion of fame which envy often hinders
a living virtue from possessing which would indeed have been given to
your ashes but with a later payment and of which you could have no
present use except it were by a secret presage of that which was to
come when you were no longer in a possibility of knowing it So that if
that were a praise or satisfaction to the greatest of emperors which
the most judicious of poets gives him

    Prsenti tibi maturos largimur honores c

that the adoration which was not allowed to Hercules and Romulus till
after death was given to Augustus living then certainly it cannot be
denied but that your grace has received a double satisfaction the one
to see yourself consecrated to immortality while you are yet alive the
other to have your praises celebrated by so dear so just and so pious
an historian

It is the consideration of this that stops my pen though I am loth to
leave so fair a subject which gives me as much field as poetry could
wish and yet no more than truth can justify But to attempt any thing
of a panegyric were to enterprize on your ladys right and to seem to
affect those praises which none but the duchess of Newcastle can
deserve when she writes the actions of her lord I shall therefore
leave that wider space and contract myself to those narrow bounds
which best become my fortune and employment

I am obliged my lord to return you not only my own acknowledgments
but to thank you in the names of former poets the names of Jonson and
DAvenantJ seem to require it from me that those favours which you
placed on them and which they wanted opportunity to own in public yet
might not be lost to the knowledge of posterity with a forgetfulness
unbecoming of the Muses who are the daughters of memory And give me
leave my lord to avow so much of vanity as to say I am proud to be
their remembrancer For by relating how gracious you have been to them
and are to me I in some measure join my name with theirs And the
continued descent of your favours to me is the best title which I can
plead for my succession I only wish that I had as great reason to be
satisfied with myself in the return of our common acknowledgments as
your grace may justly take in the conferring them For I cannot but be
very sensible that the present of an ill comedy which I here make you
is a very unsuitable way of giving thanks for them who themselves
have written so many better This pretends to nothing more than to be a
foil to those scenes which are composed by the most noble poet of our
age and nation and to be set as a watermark of the lowest ebb to
which the wit of my predecessor has sunk and run down in me But
though all of them have surpassed me in the scene there is one part of
glory in which I will not yield to any of them I mean my lord that
honour and veneration which they had for you in their lives and which I
preserve after them more holily than the vestal fires were maintained
from age to age but with a greater degree of heat and of devotion
than theirs as being with more respect and passion than they ever were

  Your GRACES

             Most obliged most humble

                    and most obedient Servant

                           JOHN DRYDEN


Footnote G William Cavendish duke of Newcastle distinguished himself
in the civil wars of Charles I He might have possessed himself of Hull
had the king more early resolved on an open rupture with the parliament
When the war broke out he levied an army of  men secured the
northern counties for the king and raised the siege of York The
invasion of the Scots prevented his farther success but he defeated the
parliamentary forces in several actions and shewed all the talents of a
great soldier After the loss of the battle of Marston Moor which
Prince Rupert hazarded in opposition to his advice he left England in
disgust and did not return till the Restoration He was much respected
when abroad and acquired the favour of many princes and amongst
others of Don John of Austria His skill in the equestrian art was
perhaps as great a recommendation as his noble birth and unstained
loyalty During the wars he had been raised from the rank of earl to
that of marquis and after the Restoration he was created duke of
Newcastle He wrote several plays of which we know only the names The
Country Captain Variety The Humourous Lovers and The Triumphant
Widow He also translated Molieres LEtourdi which our author
converted into Sir Martin Marall But his most noted work is a
splendid folio on Horsemanship with engravings in which after his
grace has been represented in every possible attitude and dress he is
at length depicted mounted on Pegasus and in the act of ascending from
a circle of Houyhnhnms kneeling around him in the act of adoration

His once celebrated duchess was Margaret daughter of Sir Charles Lucas
She was his graces second wife and married to him during his exile A
most voluminous author she wrote nineteen plays besides philosophical
essays letters and orations For the former she has condescended to
leave the following apology

The Latin phrases I could never tell But Jonson could which made him
write so well Greek Latin poets I could never read Nor their
historians but our English Speed I could not steal their wit nor
plots outtake All my plays plots my own poor brain did make From
Plutarchs story I neer took a plot Nor from romances nor from Don
Quixote

Her graces assiduity was equal to her originality She kept a bevy of
maidens of honour who were obliged at all hours of the night to
attend the summons of her bell with a light and materials to register
her graces conceptions which we beg the reader to understand were
all of a literary or philosophical nature

The good duchesss conceptions are now forgotten but it should not be
forgotten that her kind solicitude soothed and supported her husband
through a weary exile of eighteen years when their fortunes were
reduced to the lowest ebb In gratitude he appears to have encouraged
her pursuits and admired the productions of her muse In the Sessions
of Poets he is introduced as founding upon her literary pretensions
rather than his own

    Newcastle ands horse for entrance next strives
      Wellstuffed was his cloakbag and so was his breeches
    And

    Whoop quoth Apollo what a devil have we here
      Put up thy wifes trumpery good noble marquis
    And home again home again take thy career
      To provide her fresh straw and a chamber that dark is

Such were the noble personages whom Dryden deemed worthy of the fine
strains of eulogy conveyed in this dedication

Footnote H This compliment is overstrained But though Charles gained
many advantages after the earl of Newcastle had left England the north
was irrecoverably lost to his cause

Footnote I The duchess wrote her husbands Life which was translated
into Latin It is certainly the best of her graces performances

Newcastle Jonson has addressed several verses to him and composed a
Masque for the splendid entertainment which he gave to Charles I at
his house at Wellbeck when the king was on his first northern
journey




AN EVENINGS LOVE


Our author acknowledges that this play of The Mock Astrologer is
founded on Le feint Astrologue by the younger Corneille which he
in his turn had imitated from El Astrologo fingido of Calderon But
Dryden has also laid Moliere under contribution Most part of the
quarrelling scene betwixt Wildblood and Jacintha in the fourth act is
literally copied from that betwixt Lucile Eraste Marinette and Gros
Ren in Le Depit Amoureux The absurd loquacity of Don Alonzo and
his friends mode of silencing him by ringing a bell in his ears is
imitated from the scene betwixt Albert and Metaphraste in the same
play and it must be allowed it is an expedient which might be more
decently resorted to against an inundation of nonsense from a pedantic
schoolmaster as in Moliere than to stop the mouth of a noble old
Spaniard the uncle of Don Lopez mistress The play itself is more
lively than most of Drydens comedies Wildblood and Jacintha are far
more pleasant than their prototypes Celadon and Florimel and the
Spanish bustle of the plot is well calculated to keep up the attention
The character of Aurelia was perhaps suggested by the Precieuses
Ridicules of Moliere but cannot with any justice be said to be
copied from them The Preface contains some excellent remarks on the old
comedy There is also an elaborate defence the first our poet deigned
to make against the charge of plagiarism On this point he quotes the
words of Charles II who had only desired that they who accused
Dryden of theft would steal him such plays as Drydens And he
vindicates the right of an author to take his plot where he could best
find it in history or romance providing that the conduct and
disposition of the action with the dialogue character and poetical
ornaments were original Our authors use of the terms and technical
phrases of judicial astronomy intimate his acquaintance with that
pretended science in which he is known to have placed some confidence

The Mock Astrologer appears to have been acted and published in 




  THE

  PREFACE

                                   

I had thought reader in this preface to have written somewhat
concerning the difference betwixt the plays of our age and those of our
predecessors on the English stage To have shewn in what parts of
dramatic poesy we were excelled by Ben Jonson I mean humour and
contrivance of comedy and in what we may justly claim precedence of
Shakespeare and Fletcher namely in heroic plays But this design I have
waved on second considerations at least deferred it till I publish The
Conquest of Granada where the discourse will be more proper I had also
prepared to treat of the improvement of our language since Fletchers
and Jonsons days and consequently of our refining the courtship
raillery and conversation of plays But as I am willing to decline that
envy which I should draw on myself from some old opiniatre judges of
the stage so likewise I am prest in time so much that I have not
leisure at present to go through with it Neither indeed do I value
a reputation gained from comedy so far as to concern myself about it
any more than I needs must in my own defence For I think it in its
own nature inferior to all sorts of dramatick writing Low comedy
especially requires on the writers part much of conversation with the
vulgar and much of ill nature in the observation of their follies But
let all men please themselves according to their several tastes That
which is not pleasant to me may be to others who judge better And to
prevent an accusation from my enemies I am sometimes ready to imagine
that my disgust of low comedy proceeds not so much from my judgment as
from my temper which is the reason why I so seldom write it and that
when I succeed in it I mean so far as to please the audience yet I am
nothing satisfied with what I have done but am often vexed to hear the
people laugh and clap as they perpetually do where intended them no
jest while they let pass the better things without taking notice of
them Yet even this confirms me in my opinion of slighting popular
applause and of contemning that approbation which those very people
give equally with me to the zany of a mountebank or to the appearance
of an antick on the theatre without wit on the poets part or any
occasion of laughter from the actor besides the ridiculousness of his
habit and his grimaces

But I have descended before I was aware from comedy to farce which
consists principally of grimaces That I admire not any comedy equally
with tragedy is perhaps from the sullenness of my humour but that I
detest those farces which are now the most frequent entertainments of
the stage I am sure I have reason on my side Comedy consists though
of low persons yet of natural actions and characters I mean such
humours adventures and designs as are to be found and met with in the
world Farce on the other side consists of forced humours and
unnatural events Comedy presents us with the imperfections of human
nature Farce entertains us with what is monstrous and chimerical The
one causes laughter in those who can judge of men and manners by the
lively representation of their folly or corruption The other produces
the same effect in those who can judge of neither and that only by its
extravagances The first works on the judgment and fancy the latter on
the fancy only There is more of satisfaction in the former kind of
laughter and in the latter more of scorn But how it happens that an
impossible adventure should cause our mirth I cannot so easily imagine
Something there may be in the oddness of it because on the stage it is
the common effect of things unexpected to surprise us into a delight
and that is to be ascribed to the strange appetite as I may call it of
the fancy which like that of a longing woman often runs out into the
most extravagant desires and is better satisfied sometimes with loam
or with the rinds of trees than with the wholesome nourishments of
life In short there is the same difference betwixt farce and comedy
as betwixt an empirick and a true physician Both of them may attain
their ends but what the one performs by hazard the other does by
skill And as the artist is often unsuccessful while the mountebank
succeeds so farces more commonly take the people than comedies For to
write unnatural things is the most probable way of pleasing them who
understand not nature And a true poet often misses of applause because
he cannot debase himself to write so ill as to please his audience

After all it is to be acknowledged that most of those comedies which
have been lately written have been allied too much to farce And this
must of necessity fall out till we forbear the translation of French
plays For their poets wanting judgment to make or to maintain true
characters strive to cover their defects with ridiculous figures and
grimaces While I say this I accuse myself as well as others And this
very play would rise up in judgment against me if I would defend all
things I have written to be natural But I confess I have given too much
to the people in it and am ashamed for them as well as for myself that
I have pleased them at so cheap a rate Not that there is any thing here
which I would not defend to an illnatured judge for I despise their
censures who I am sure would write worse on the same subject but
because I love to deal clearly and plainly and to speak of my own
faults with more criticism than I would of another poets Yet I think
it no vanity to say that this comedy has as much of entertainment in
it as many others which have been lately written And if I find my own
errors in it I am able at the same time to arraign all my
contemporaries for greater As I pretend not that I can write humour so
none of them can reasonably pretend to have written it as they ought
Jonson was the only man of all ages and nations who has performed it
well and that but in three or four of his comedies The rest are but a
crambe bis cocta the same humours a little varied and written worse
Neither was it more allowable in him than it is in our present poets
to represent the follies of particular persons of which many have
accused him Parcere personis dicere de vitiis is the rule of plays
And Horace tells you that the old comedy amongst the Grecians was
silenced for the too great liberties of the poets

    In vitium libertas excidit et vim
    Dignam lege regi Lex est accepta chorusque
    Turpiter obticuit sublato jure nocendi

Of which he gives you the reason in another place where having given
the precept

    Neve immunda crepent ignominiosaque dicta

He immediately subjoins

    Offenduntur enim quibus est equus et pater et res

But Ben Jonson is to be admired for many excellencies and can be taxed
with fewer failings than any English poet I know I have been accused as
an enemy of his writings but without any other reason than that I do
not admire him blindly and without looking into his imperfections For
why should he only be exempted from those frailties from which Homer
and Virgil are not free Or why should there be any ipse dixit in our
poetry any more than there is in our philosophy I admire and applaud
him where I ought Those who do more do but value themselves in their
admiration of him and by telling you they extol Ben Jonsons way
would insinuate to you that they can practise it For my part I declare
that I want judgment to imitate him and should think it a great
impudence in myself to attempt it To make men appear pleasantly
ridiculous on the stage was as I have said his talent and in this he
needed not the acumen of wit but that of judgment For the characters
and representations of folly are only the effects of observation and
observation is an effect of judgment Some ingenious men for whom I
have a particular esteem have thought I have much injured Ben Jonson
when I have not allowed his wit to be extraordinary But they confound
the notion of what is witty with what is pleasant That Ben Jonsons
plays were pleasant he must want reason who denies But that
pleasantness was not properly wit or the sharpness of conceit but the
natural imitation of folly Which I confess to be excellent in its kind
but not to be of that kind which they pretend Yet if we will believe
Quintilian in his chapter de movendo risu he gives his opinion of
both in these following words Stulta reprehendere facillimum est nam
per se sunt ridicula et  derisu non procul abest risus Sed rem
urbanam facit aliqua ex nobis adjectio

And some perhaps would be apt to say of Jonson as it was said of
Demosthenesnon displicuisse illi jocos sed non contigisse I will
not deny but that I approve most the mixt way of comedy that which is
neither all wit nor all humour but the result of both Neither so
little of humour as Fletcher shews nor so little of love and wit as
Jonson neither all cheat with which the best plays of the one are
filled nor all adventure which is the common practice of the other I
would have the characters well chosen and kept distant from interfering
with each other which is more than Fletcher or Shakespeare did But I
would have more of the urbana venusta salsa faceta and the rest
which Quintilian reckons up as the ornaments of wit and these are
extremely wanting in Ben Jonson As for repartee in particular as it
is the very soul of conversation so it is the greatest grace of comedy
where it is proper to the characters There may be much of acuteness in
a thing well said but there is more in a quick reply Sunt enim long
venustiora omnia in respondendo qum in provocando Of one thing I am
sure that no man ever will decry wit but he who despairs of it
himself and who has no other quarrel to it but that which the fox had
to the grapes Yet as Mr Cowley who had a greater portion of it than
any man I know tells us in his Character of Witrather than all
wit let there be none I think there is no folly so great in any poet
of our age as the superfluity and waste of wit was in some of our
predecessors particularly we may say of Fletcher and of Shakespeare
what was said of Ovid In omni ejus ingenio facilius quod rejici qum
quod adjici potest invenies The contrary of which was true in Virgil
and our incomparable Jonson

Some enemies of repartee have observed to us that there is a great
latitude in their characters which are made to speak it and that it is
easier to write wit than humour because in the characters of humour
the poet is confined to make the person speak what is only proper to it
whereas all kind of wit is proper in the character of a witty person
But by their favour there are as different characters in wit as in
folly Neither is all kind of wit proper in the mouth of every ingenious
person A witty coward and a witty brave must speak differently
Falstaff and the Liar speak not like Don John in the Chances
and Valentine in Wit without Money And Jonsons Truewit in the
Silent Woman is a character different from all of them Yet it
appears that this one character of wit was more difficult to the
author than all his images of humour in the play for those he could
describe and manage from his observations of men this he has taken at
least a part of it from books Witness the speeches in the first act
translated verbatim out of Ovid De Arte Amandi To omit what
afterwards he borrowed from the sixth satire of Juvenal against women

However if I should grant that there were a greater latitude in
characters of wit than in those of humour yet that latitude would be
of small advantage to such poets who have too narrow an imagination to
write it And to entertain an audience perpetually with humour is to
carry them from the conversation of gentlemen and treat them with the
follies and extravagancies of Bedlam

I find I have launched out farther than I intended in the beginning of
this preface and that in the heat of writing I have touched at
something which I thought to have avoided It is time now to draw
homeward and to think rather of defending myself than assaulting
others I have already acknowledged that this play is far from perfect
But I do not think myself obliged to discover the imperfections of it to
my adversaries any more than a guilty person is bound to accuse himself
before his judges It is charged upon me that I make debauched persons
such as they say my Astrologer and Gamester are my protagonists or
the chief persons of the drama and that I make them happy in the
conclusion of my play against the law of comedy which is to reward
virtue and punish vice I answer first that I know no such law to
have been constantly observed in comedy either by the ancient or modern
poets Chrea is made happy in the Eunuch after having deflowered a
virgin and Terence generally does the same through all his plays where
you perpetually see not only debauched young men enjoy their
mistresses but even the courtezans themselves rewarded and honoured in
the catastrophe The same may be observed in Plautus almost everywhere
Ben Jonson himself after whom I may be proud to err has given me more
than once the example of it That in The Alchemist is notorious where
Face after having contrived and carried on the great cozenage of the
play and continued in it without repentance to the last is not only
forgiven by his master but enriched by his consent with the spoils of
those whom he had cheated And which is more his master himself a
grave man and a widower is introduced taking his mans counsel
debauching the widow first in hope to marry her afterward In the
Silent Woman Dauphine who with the other two gentlemen is of the
same character with my Celadon in the Maiden Queen and with
Wildblood in this professes himself in love with all the collegiate
ladies and they likewise are all of the same character with each other
excepting only Madam Otter who has something singular Yet this
naughty Dauphine is crowned in the end with the possession of his
uncles estate and with the hopes of enjoying all his mistresses and
his friend Mr Truewit the best character of a gentleman which Ben
Jonson ever made is not ashamed to pimp for him As for Beaumont and
Fletcher I need not allege examples out of them for that were to quote
almost all their comedies But now it will be objected that I patronise
vice by the authority of former poets and extenuate my own faults by
recrimination I answer that as I defend myself by their example so
that example I defend by reason and by the end of all dramatic poesy
In the first place therefore give me leave to shew you their mistake
who have accused me They have not distinguished as they ought betwixt
the rules of tragedy and comedy In tragedy where the actions and
persons are great and the crimes horrid the laws of justice are more
strictly observed and examples of punishment to be made to deter
mankind from the pursuit of vice Faults of this kind have been rare
amongst the ancient poets for they have punished in Oedipus and in
his posterity the sin which he knew not he had committed Medea is
the only example I remember at present who escapes from punishment
after murder Thus tragedy fulfils one great part of its institution
which is by example to instruct But in comedy it is not so for the
chief end of it is divertisement and delight and that so much that it
is disputed I think by Heinsius before Horaces Art of Poetry
whether instruction be any part of its employment At least I am sure it
can be but its secondary end for the business of the poet is to make
you laugh when he writes humour he makes folly ridiculous when wit
he moves you if not always to laughter yet to a pleasure that is more
noble And if he works a cure on folly and the small imperfections in
mankind by exposing them to public view that cure is not performed by
an immediate operation For it works first on the illnature of the
audience they are moved to laugh by the representation of deformity
and the shame of that laughter teaches us to amend what is ridiculous in
our manners This being then established that the first end of comedy
is delight and instruction only the second it may reasonably be
inferred that comedy is not so much obliged to the punishment of faults
which it represents as tragedy For the persons in comedy are of a
lower quality the action is little and the faults and vices are but
the sallies of youth and the frailties of human nature and not
premeditated crimes such to which all men are obnoxious not such as
are attempted only by few and those abandoned to all sense of virtue
such as move pity and commiseration not detestation and horror such
in short as may be forgiven not such as must of necessity be punished
But lest any man should think that I write this to make libertinism
amiable or that I cared not to debase the end and institution of
comedy so I might thereby maintain my own errors and those of better
poets I must further declare both for them and for myself that we
make not vicious persons happy but only as Heaven makes sinners so
that is by reclaiming them first from vice For so it is to be supposed
they are when they resolve to marry for then enjoying what they
desire in one they cease to pursue the love of many So Chrea is
made happy by Terence in marrying her whom he had deflowered and so
are Wildblood and the Astrologer in this play

There is another crime with which I am charged at which I am yet much
less concerned because it does not relate to my manners as the former
did but only to my reputation as a poet a name of which I assure the
reader I am nothing proud and therefore cannot be very solicitous to
defend it I am taxed with stealing all my plays and that by some who
should be the last men from whom I would steal any part of them There
is one answer which I will not make but it has been made for me by him
to whose grace and patronage I owe all things

    Et spes et ratio studiorum in Csare tantum

and without whose command they should no longer be troubled with any
thing of minethat he only desired that they who accused me of
theft would always steal him plays like mine But though I have reason
to be proud of this defence yet I should wave it because I have a
worse opinion of my own comedies than any of my enemies can have It is
true that wherever I have liked any story in a romance novel or
foreign play I have made no difficulty nor ever shall to take the
foundation of it to build it up and to make it proper for the English
stage And I will be so vain to say it has lost nothing in my hands
But it always cost me so much trouble to heighten it for our theatre
which is incomparably more curious in all the ornaments of dramatic
poesy than the French or Spanish that when I had finished my play it
was like the hulk of Sir Francis Drake so strangely altered that there
scarcely remained any plank of the timber which first built it To
witness this I need go no farther than this play it was first Spanish
and called El Astrologo Fingido then made French by the younger
Corneille and is now translated into English and in print under the
name of The Feigned Astrologer What I have performed in this will
best appear by comparing it with those You will see that I have
rejected some adventures which I judged were not divertising that I
have heightened those which I have chosen and that I have added others
which were neither in the French nor Spanish And besides you will
easily discover that the walk of the Astrologer is the least
considerable in my play For the design of it turns more on the parts of
Wildblood and Jacinta who are the chief persons in it I have
farther to add that I seldom use the wit and language of any romance or
play which I undertake to alter because my own invention as bad as it
is can furnish me with nothing so dull as what is there Those who have
called Virgil Terence and Tasso plagiaries though they much injured
them had yet a better colour for their accusation for Virgil has
evidently translated Theocritus Hesiod and Homer in many places
besides what he has taken from Ennius in his own language Terence was
not only known to translate Menander which he avows also in his
prologues but was said also to be helped in those translations by
Scipio the African and Llius And Tasso the most excellent of modern
poets and whom I reverence next to Virgil has taken both from Homer
many admirable things which were left untouched by Virgil and from
Virgil himself where Homer could not furnish him Yet the bodies of
Virgils and Tassos poems were their own and so are all the ornaments
of language and elocution in them The same if there were any thing
commendable in this play I could say for it But I will come nearer to
our own countrymen Most of Shakespeares plays I mean the stories of
them are to be found in the Hecatomithi or Hundred Novels of
Cinthio I have myself read in his Italian that of Romeo and Juliet
the Moor of Venice and many others of them Beaumont and Fletcher had
most of theirs from Spanish novels Witness The Chances The Spanish
Curate Rule a Wife and have a Wife The Little French Lawyer and
so many others of them as compose the greatest part of their volume in
folio Ben Jonson indeed has designed his plots himself but no man
has borrowed so much from the ancients as he has done and he did well
in it for he has thereby beautified our language

But these little critics do not well consider what is the work of a
poet and what the graces of a poem the story is the least part of
either I mean the foundation of it before it is modelled by the art of
him who writes it who forms it with more care by exposing only the
beautiful parts of it to view than a skilful lapidary sets a jewel On
this foundation of the story the characters are raised and since no
story can afford characters enough for the variety of the English stage
it follows that it is to be altered and enlarged with new persons
accidents and designs which will almost make it new When this is
done the forming it into acts and scenes disposing of actions and
passions into their proper places and beautifying both with
descriptions similitudes and propriety of language is the principal
employment of the poet as being the largest field of fancy which is
the principal quality required in him for so much the word Greek
poits implies Judgment indeed is necessary in him but it is fancy
that gives the lifetouches and the secret graces to it especially in
serious plays which depend not much on observation For to write
humour in comedy which is the theft of poets from mankind little of
fancy is required the poet observes only what is ridiculous and
pleasant folly and by judging exactly what is so he pleases in the
representation of it

But in general the employment of a poet is like that of a curious
gunsmith or watchmaker the iron or silver is not his own but they are
the least part of that which gives the value the price lies wholly in
the workmanship And he who works dully on a story without moving
laughter in a comedy or raising concernment in a serious play is no
more to be accounted a good poet than a gunsmith of the Minories is to
be compared with the best workman of the town

But I have said more of this than I intended and more perhaps than I
needed to have done I shall but laugh at them hereafter who accuse me
with so little reason and withal contemn their dulness who if they
could ruin that little reputation I have got and which I value not yet
would want both wit and learning to establish their own or to be
remembered in after ages for any thing but only that which makes them
ridiculous in this




PROLOGUE


  When first our poet set himself to write
  Like a young bridegroom on his weddingnight
  He laid about him and did so bestir him
  His muse could never lie in quiet for him
  But now his honeymoon is gone and past
  Yet the ungrateful drudgery must last
  And he is bound as civil husbands do
  To strain himself in complaisance to you
  To write in pain and counterfeit a bliss
  Like the faint smacking of an afterkiss
  But you like wives ill pleased supply his want
  Each writing monsieur is a fresh gallant
  And though perhaps twas done as well before
  Yet still theres something in a new amour
  Your several poets work with several tools
  One gets you wits another gets you fools
  This pleases you with some bystroke of wit
  This finds some cranny that was never hit
  But should these janty lovers daily come
  To do your work like your good man at home
  Their fine smalltimbered wits would soon decay
  These are gallants but for a holiday
  Others you had who oftner have appeared
  Whom for mere impotence you have cashiered
  Such as at first came on with pomp and glory
  But overstraining soon fell flat before ye
  Their useless weight with patience long was born
  But at the last you threw them off with scorn
  As for the poet of this present night              
  Though now he claims in you a husbands right      
  He will not hinder you of fresh delight            
  He like a seaman seldom will appear
  And means to trouble home but thrice ayear
  That only time from your gallants hell borrow
  Be kind today and cuckold him tomorrow

ACT I SCENE I


Don LOPEZ and a Servant walking over the stage Enter another
Servant and follows him

  Serv Don Lopez

  Lop Any new business

  Serv My master had forgot this letter
  Which he conjures you as you are his friend
  To give Aurelia from him

  Lop Tell Don Melchor
  Tis a hard task which he enjoins me
  He knows I love her and much more than he
  For I love her alone but he divides
  His passion betwixt two Did he consider
  How great a pain tis to dissemble love
  He would never practise it

  Serv He knows his fault but cannot mend it

  Lop To make the poor Aurelia believe
  Hes gone for Flanders whilst he lies concealed
  And every night makes visits to her cousin
  When will he leave this strange extravagance

  Serv When he can love one more or tother less

  Lop Before I loved myself I promised him
  To serve him in his love and Ill perform it
  Howeer repugnant to my own concernments

  Serv You are a noble cavalier
                                                        Exit Servant

Enter BELLAMY WILDBLOOD and MASKALL

   Serv Sir your guests of the English ambassadors retinue

  Lop Cavaliers will you please to command my coach to take the air
  this evening

  Bel We have not yet resolved how to dispose of ourselves but
  however we are highly acknowledging to you for your civility

  Lop You cannot more oblige me than by laying your commands on me

  Wild We kiss your hand
                                             Exeunt LOPEZ and Serv

  Bel Give the Don his due he entertained us nobly this carnival

  Wild Give the devil the Don for any thing I liked in his
  entertainment

  Bel I hope we had variety enough

Wild Ay it looked like variety till we came to taste it there were
twenty several dishes to the eye but in the palate nothing but spices
I had a mind to eat of a pheasant and as soon as I got it into my
mouth I found I was chewing a limb of cinnamon then I went to cut a
piece of kid and no sooner it had touched my lips but it turned to red
pepper At last I began to think myself another kind of Midas that
every thing I touched should be turned to spice

Bel And for my part I imagined his Catholic majesty had invited us
to eat his Indies But prythee lets leave the discourse of it and
contrive together how we may spend the evening for in this hot country
tis as in the creation the evening and the morning make the day

Wild I have a little serious business

Bel Put it off till a fitter season For the truth is business is
then only tolerable when the world and the flesh have no baits to set
before us for the day

Wild But mine perhaps is public business

Bel Why is any business more public than drinking and wenching Look
on those grave plodding fellows that pass by us as though they were
meditating the reconquest of Flanders Fly them to a mark and Ill
undertake three parts of four are going to their courtezans I tell
thee Jack the whisking of a silk gown and the rush of a tabby
petticoat are as comfortable sounds to one of these rich citizens as
the chink of their pieces of eight

Wild This being granted to be the common design of human kind it is
more than probable it is yours therefore Ill leave you to the
prosecution of it

Bel Nay good Jack mine is but a mistress in embryo the possession
of her is at least some days off and till that time thy company will
be pleasant and may be profitable to carry on the work I would use
thee like an under kind of chemist to blow coals it will be time
enough for me to be alone when I come to projection

Wild You must excuse me Frank I have made an appointment at the
gaminghouse

Bel What to do there I prythee To misspend that money which kind
fortune intended for a mistress Or to learn new oaths and curses to
carry into England That is not itI heard you were to marry when you
left home Perhaps that may be still running in your head and keep you
virtuous

Wild Marriage quotha what dost thou think
I have been bred in the deserts of Africa or among the savages of
America Nay if I had I must needs have known better things than so
the light of nature would not have let me go so far astray

Bel Well what think you of the Prado this evening

Wild Pox upont tis worse than our contemplative HydePark

Bel Oh but we must submit to the custom of the country for
courtship Whatever the means are we are sure the end is still the same
in all places But who are these

Enter DON ALONZO DE RIBERA with his two Daughters THEODOSIA and
JACINTHA and BEATRIX their Woman passing by

Theo Do you see those strangers sister that eye us so earnestly

Jac Yes and I guess them to be feathers of the English ambassadors
train for I think I saw them at the grand audienceand have the
strongest temptation in the world to talk to them A mischief on this
modesty

Beat A mischief of this father of yours that haunts you so

Jac Tis very true Beatrix for though I am the younger sister I
should have the grace to lay modesty first aside However sister let
us pull up our veils and give them an essay of our faces
                  They pull up their veils and pull them down again

Wild Ah Bellamy undone undone Dost thou see those beauties

Bel Prythee Wildblood hold thy tongue and do not spoil my
contemplation I am undoing myself as fast as ever I can too

Wild I must go to them

Bel Hold madman Dost thou not see their father Hast thou a mind to
have our throats cut

Wild By a Hector of fourscore Hang our throats What a lover and
cautious
                                               Is going towards them

Alon Come away daughters we shall be late else

Bel Look you they are on the wing already

Wild Prythee dear Frank lets follow them I long to know who they
are

Mask Let me alone Ill dog them for you

Bel I am glad ont for my shoes so pinch me I can scarce go a step
farther

Wild Cross the way there lives a shoemaker Away quickly that we may
not spoil our design
                                              Exeunt BEL and WILD

Alon offers to go off Now friend whats your business to
follow us

Mask Noble Don tis only to recommend my service to you A certain
violent passion I have had for your worship since the first moment that
I saw you

Alon I never saw thee before to my remembrance

Mask No matter sir true love never stands upon ceremon
y

Alon Prythee be gone my saucy companion or
Ill clap an alguazil upon thy heels I tell thee I have no need of thy
service

Mask Having no servant of your own I cannot in good manners leave
you destitute

Alon Ill beat thee if thou followest me

Mask I am your spaniel sir the more you beat me the better Ill

Alon Let me entreat thee to be gone the boys will hoot at me to see
me followed thus against my will

Mask Shall you and I concern ourselves for what the boys do sir
Pray do you hear the news at court

Alon Prythee whats the news to thee or me

Mask Will you be at the next juego de cannas

Alon If I think good

Mask Pray go on sir we can discourse as we walk together And
whither were you now agoing sir

Alon To the devil I think

Mask O not this year or two sir by your age

Jac My father was never so matched for talking in all his life
before he who loves to hear nothing but himself Prythee Beatrix
stay behind and see what this impudent Englishman would have

Beat Sir if youll let my master go Ill be his pawn

Mask Well sir I kiss your hand in hope to wait on you another
time

Alon Let us mend our pace to get clear of him

Theo If you do not hell be with you again like Atalanta in the
fable and make you drop another of your golden apples
                                   Exeunt ALON THEO and JACINTHA
                                MASKALL whispers BEATRIX the while

Beat How much good language is here thrown away to make me betray my
ladies

Mask If you will discover nothing of them let me discourse with you
a little

Beat As little as you please

Mask They are rich I suppose

Beat Now you are talking of them again But they are as rich as they
are fair

Mask Then they have the Indies Well but their names my sweet
mistress

Beat Sweet servant their names are

Mask Their names areout with it boldly

Beat A secretnot to be disclosed

Mask A secret say you Nay then I conjure you as you are a woman
tell it me

Beat Not a syllable

Mask Why then as you are a waitingwoman as you are the sieve of
all your ladys secrets tell it me

Beat You lose your labour nothing will strain through me

Mask Are you so well stopped in the bottom

Beat It was enjoined me strictly as a secret

Mask Was it enjoined thee strictly and canst thou hold it Nay
then thou art invincible But by that face that more than ugly face
which I suspect to be under thy veil disclose it to me

Beat By that face of thine which is a natural visor I will not tell
thee

Mask By thy

Beat No more swearing I beseech you

Mask That womans worth little that is not worth an oath Well get
thee gone now I think ont thou shalt not tell me

Beat Shall I not Who shall hinder me They are Don Alonzo de
Riberas daughters

Mask Out out Ill stop my ears

Beat They live hard by in the Calle maior

Mask O infernal tongue

Beat And are going to the next chapel with their father

Mask Wilt thou never have done tormenting me In my conscience anon
thou wilt blab out their names too

Beat Their names are Theodosia and Jacintha

Mask And wheres your great secret now

Beat Now I think I am revenged on you for running down my poor old
master

Mask Thou art not fully revenged till thou hast told me thy own name
too

Beat Tis Beatrix at your service sir pray remember I wait on
them

Mask Now I have enough I must be going

Beat I perceive you are just like other men when you have got your
ends you care not how soon you are going Farewellyoull be constant

Mask If thy face when I see it do not give me occasion to be
otherwise

Beat You shall take a sample that you may praise it when you see it
next
                                               She pulls up her veil

Enter WILDBLOOD and BELLAMY

Wild Look theres your dog with a duck ins mouthOh shes got

Beat Well Maskall what news of the ladies of the lake

next chapel

Wild Away then let us lose no time I thank heaven I never found
myself better inclined to godliness than at this present
                                                              Exeunt


SCENE IIA Chapel

Enter ALONZO THEODOSIA JACINTHA BEATRIX other Ladies and
Cavaliers at their devotions

Alon By that time you have told your beads Ill be again with you
                                                                Exit

Jac Do you think the Englishmen will come after us

Beat Do you think they can stay from you

Jac For my part I feel a certain qualm upon my heart which makes me
believe I am breeding love to one of them

Theo How love Jacintha in so short a time Cupids arrow was well
feathered to reach you so suddenly

Jac Faith as good at first as at last sister tis a thing that
must be done and therefore tis best dispatching it out othe way

Theo But you do not mean to tell him so whom you love

Jac Why should I keep myself and servant in
pain for that which may be cured at a days warning

Beat My lady tells you true madam long tedious courtship may be
proper for cold countries where their frosts are long a thawing but
heaven be praised we live in a warm climate

Theo The truth is in other countries they have opportunities of
courtship which we have not they are not mewed up with double locks
and grated windows but may receive addresses at their leisure

Jac But our love here is like our grass if it be not mowed quickly
tis burnt up

Enter BELLAMY WILDBLOOD and MASKALL They look about them

Theo Yonder are your gallants send you comfort of them I am for my
devotions

Jac Now for my heart can I think of no other prayer but only that
they may not mistake us Why sister sister will you pray What injury
have I ever done you that you should pray in my company If your
servant Don Melchor were here we should have you mind heaven as little
as the best of us

Beat They are at a loss madam shall I put up my veil that they may
take aim

Jac No let them take their fortune in the dark We shall see what
archers these English are

Bel Which are they thinkst thou

Wild Theres no knowing them they are all children of darkness

Bel Ill be sworn they have one sign of godliness among them theres
no distinction of persons here

Wild Pox othis blindmansbuff they may be ashamed to provoke a
man thus by their keeping themselves so close

Bel You are for the youngest you say tis the eldest has smitten
me And here I fix if I am right happy man be his dole
                                                        By THEODOSIA

  Wild Ill take my fortune here
                                                         By JACINTHA
  Madam I hope a stranger may take the liberty without offence to
  offer his devotions by you

Jac That sir would interrupt mine without being any advantage to
your own

Wild My advantage madam is very evident for the kind saint to
whom you pray may by the neighbourhood mistake my devotions for
yours

Jac O sir our saints can better distinguish between the prayers of
a Catholic and a Lutheran

Wild I beseech you madam trouble not yourself for my religion for
though I am a heretic to the men of your country to your ladies I am a
very zealous Catholic and for fornication and adultery I assure you I
hold with both churches

Theo to Bel Sir if you will not be more devout be at least more
civil you see you are observed

Bel And pray madam what do you think the lookers on imagine I am
employed about

Theo I will not trouble myself to guess

Bel Why by all circumstances they must conclude that I am making
love to you and methinks it were scarce civil to give the opinion of
so much good company the lie

Theo If this were true you would have little reason to thank them
for their divination

Bel Meaning I should not be loved again

Theo You have interpreted my riddle and may take it for your pains

Enter ALONZO and goes apart to his devotion

Beat Madam your father is returned

Bel She has nettled me would I could be revenged on her

Wild Do you see their father Let us make as though we talked to one
another that we may not be suspected

Beat You have lost your Englishmen

Jac No no tis but design I warrant you You shall see these
island cocks wheel about immediately
                                 The English gather up close to them

Beat Perhaps they thought they were observed

Wild to Bel Talk not of our country ladies I declare myself for the
Spanish beauties

Bel Prythee tell me what thou canst find to doat on in these
Castilians

Wild Their wit and beauty

Theo Now for our champion St Jago for Spain

Bel Faith I can speak no such miracles of either for their beauty
tis much as the Moors left it not altogether so deep a black as the
true Ethiopian a kind of beauty that is too civil to the lookerson to
do them any mischief

Jac This was your frowardness that provoked
him sister

Theo But they shall not carry it off so

Bel As for their wit you may judge it by their breeding which is
commonly in a nunnery where the want of mankind while they are there
makes them value the blessing ever after

Theo Prythee dear Jacintha tell me what kind of creatures were
those we saw yesterday at the audience Those I mean that looked so
like Frenchmen in their habits but only became their apishness so much
worse

Jac Englishmen I think they called them

Theo Cry you mercy they were of your wild English indeed that is
a kind of northern beast that is taught its feats of activity in
Monsieurland and for doing them too lubberly is laughed at all the
world over

Bel Wildblood I perceive the women understand little of discourse
their gallants do not use them to it They get upon their jennets and
prance before their ladies windows there the palfrey curvets and
bounds and in short entertains them for his master

Wild And this horseplay they call making love

Beat Your father madam

Alon Daughters what cavaliers are those which were talking by you

Jac Englishmen I believe sir at their devotionsCavalier would
you would try to pray a little better than you have rallied
                                                       Aside to WILD

Wild Hang me if I put all my devotions out of order for you I
remember I prayed but on Tuesday last and my time comes not till
Tuesday next

Mask You had as good pray sir she will not stir till you have Say
any thing

Wild Fair lady though I am not worthy of the least of your favours
yet give me the happiness this evening to see you at your fathers door
that I may acquaint you with part of my sufferings
                                                        Aside to JAC

Alon Come daughters have you done

Jac Immediately sirCavalier I will not fail to be there at the
time appointed if it be but to teach you more wit henceforward than
to engage your heart so lightly
                                                       Aside to WILD

Wild I have engaged my heart with so much zeal and true devotion to
your divine beauty that

Alon What means this cavalier

Jac Some zealous ejaculation

Alan May the saint hear him

Jac Ill answer for her
                                         Exeunt Father and Daughters

Wild Now Bellamy what success

Bel I prayed to a more marble saint than that
was in the shrine but you it seems have been successful

Wild And so shalt thou let me alone for both

Bel If youll undertake it Ill make bold to indulge my love and
within these two hours be a desperate inamorato I feel I am coming
apace to it

Wild Faith I can love at any time with a wish at my rate I give my
heart according to the old law of pawns to be returned me before
sunset

Bel I love only that I may keep my heart warm for a mans a pool if
love stir him not and to bring it to that pass I first resolve whom to
love and presently after imagine I am in love for a strong imagination
is required in a lover as much as in a witch

Wild And is this all your receipt

Bel These are my principal ingredients as for piques jealousies
duels daggers and halters I let them alone to the vulgar

Wild Prythee lets round the street a little till Maskall watches
for their woman

Bel Thats well thought on He shall about it immediately We will
attempt the mistress by the maid Women by women still are best
betrayed
                                                              Exeunt




ACT II SCENE I


Enter WILDBLOOD BELLAMY and MASKALL

Wild Did you speak with her woman

Mask Yes but she was in haste and bid me wait her hereabouts when
she returned

Bel Then you have discovered nothing more

Mask Only in general that Donna Theodosia is engaged elsewhere so
that all your courtship will be to no purposeBut for your mistress
sir To WILD she is waded out of her depth in love to you already

Wild Thats very hard when I am scarce kneedeep with her Tis
true I have given her hold of my heart but if she take not heed it
will slip through her fingers

Bel You are prince of the soil sir and may take your pleasure when
you please but I am the eve to your holiday and must fast for being
joined to you

Wild Were I as thou art I would content myself with having but one
fair flight at her without wearying myself on the wing for a retrieve
for when all is done the quarry is but a woman

Bel Thank you sir you would fly them both yourself and while I
turn tail we should have you come gingling with your bells in the neck
of my partridge Do you remember who encouraged me to love and promised
me his assistance

Wild Ay while there was hope Frank while there was hope but
theres no contending with ones destiny

Bel Nay it may be I care as little for her as another man but
while she flies before me I must follow I can love a woman first with
ease but if she begins to fly before me I grow opiniatre as the
devil

Wild What a secret have you found out Why tis the nature of all
mankind We love to get our mistresses and purr over them as cats do
over mice and let them go a little way and all the pleasure is to pat
them back again But yours I take it Frank is gone too far Prythee
how long dost thou intend to love at this rate

Bel Till the evil constellation be past over me Yet I believe it
would hasten my recovery if I knew whom she loved

Mask You shall not be long without that satisfaction

Wild St the door opens and two women are coming out

Bel By their stature they should be thy gracious mistress and
Beatrix

Wild Methinks you should know your cue then and withdraw

Bel Well Ill leave you to your fortune but if you come to close
fighting I shall make bold to run in and part you
                                  BELLAMY and MASKALL withdrawing

Wild Yonder she comes with full sails ifaith Ill hail her amain
for England

Enter JACINTHA and BEATRIX at the other end of the stage

Beat You do love him then

Jac Yes most vehemently

Beat But set some bounds to your affection

Jac None but fools confine their pleasure What usurer ever thought
his coffers held too much No Ill give myself the swing and love
without reserve If I keep a passion Ill not starve it in my service

Beat But are you sure he will deserve this kindness

Jac I never trouble myself so long beforehand Jealousies and
disquiets are the dregs of an amour but Ill leave mine before I have
drawn it off so low When it once grows troubled Ill give vent to a
fresh draught

Beat Yet it is but prudence to try him first no pilot ventures on an
unknown coast without sounding

Jac Well to satisfy thee I am content partly too because I find
a kind of pleasure in laying baits for him

Beat The two great virtues of a lover are constancy and liberality
if he possess those two you may be happy in him

Jac Nay if he be not lord and master of both those qualities I
disown himBut who goes there

Beat He I warrant you madam for his servant told me he was waiting
hereabout

Jac Watch the door give me notice if any come

  Beat Ill secure you madam
                                                           Exit BEAT

Jac To WILD What have you laid an ambush for me

Wild Only to make a reprisal of my heart

Jac Tis so wild that the lady who has it in her keeping would be
glad she were well rid ont it does so flutter about the cage Tis a
mere Bajazet and if it be not let out the sooner will beat out its
brains against the grates

Wild I am afraid the lady has not fed it and tis wild for hunger

Jac Or perhaps it wants company shall she put another to it

Wild Ay but then it were best to trust them out of the cage
together let them hop about at liberty

Jac But if they should lose one another in the wide world

Wild Theyll meet at night I warrant them

Jac But is not your heart of the nature of those birds that breed in
one country and go to winter in another

Wild Suppose it does so yet I take my mate along with me And now
to leave our parables and speak in the language of the vulgar what
think you of a voyage to merry England

Jac Just as sops frog did of leaping into a deep well in a
drought If he ventured the leap there might be water but if there
were no water how should he get out again

Wild Faith we live in a good honest country where we are content
with our old vices partly because we want wit to invent more new A
colony of Spaniards or spiritual Italians planted among us would make
us much more racy Tis true our variety is not much but to speak
nobly of our way of living tis like that of the sun which rises and
looks upon the same thing he saw yesterday and goes to bed again

Jac But I hear your women live most blessedly there is no such thing
as jealousy among the husbands if any man has horns he bears them as
loftily as a stag and as inoffensively

Wild All this I hope gives you no ill character of the country

Jac But what need we go into another climate as our love was born
here so let it live and die here and be honestly buried in its native
country

Wild Faith agreed with all my heart For I am none of those
unreasonable lovers that propose to themselves the loving to eternity
The truth is a month is commonly my stint but in that month I love
so dreadfully that it is after a twelvemonths rate of common love

Jac Or would not a fortnight serve our turn for in troth a month
looks somewhat dismally tis a whole Egyptian year If a moon changes
in my love I shall think my Cupid grown dull or fallen into an
apoplexy

Wild Well I pray heaven we both get off as clear as we imagine for
my part I like your humour so damnably well that I fear I am in for a
week longer than I proposed I am half afraid your Spanish planet and my
English one have been acquainted and have found out some byroom or
other in the twelve houses I wish they have been honourable

Jac The best way for both were to take up in time yet I am afraid
our forces are engaged so far that we must make a battle ont What
think you of disobliging one another from this day forward and shewing
all our ill humours at the first which lovers use to keep as a reserve
till they are married

Wild Or let us encourage one another to a breach by the dangers of
possession I have a song to that purpose

Jac Pray let me hear it I hope it will go to the tune of one of our
Passacalles


  SONG

    You charmed me not with that fair face
      Though it was all divine
    To be anothers is the grace
      That makes me wish you mine
    The gods and fortune take their part
      Who like young monarchs fight
    And boldly dare invade that heart
      Which is anothers right
    First mad with hope we undertake
      To pull up every bar
    But once possessed we faintly make
      A dull defensive war
    Now every friend is turned a foe
      In hope to get our store
    And passion make us cowards grow
      Which made us brave before

Jac Believe it cavalier you are a dangerous person Do you hold
forth your gifts in hopes to make me love you less

Wild They would signify little if we were once married Those
gaieties are all nipt and frostbitten in the marriagebed ifaith

Jac I am sorry to hear tis so cold a place But tis all one to us
who do not mean to trouble it The truth is your humour pleases me
exceedingly how long it will do so I know not but so long as it does
I am resolved to give myself the content of seeing you For if I should
once constrain myself I might fall in love in good earnest But I have
stayed too long with you and would be loth to surfeit you at first

Wild Surfeit me madam why you have but tantalized me all this
while

Jac What would you have

Wild A hand or lip or any thing that you can spare when you have
conjured up a spirit he must have some employment or hell tear you
apieces

Jac Well heres my picture to help your contemplation in my
absence

Wild You have already the original of mine But some revenge you must
allow me A locket of diamonds or some such trifle the next time I
kiss your hand

Jac Fie fie you do not think me mercenary Yet now I think ont
Ill put you into our Spanish mode of love Our ladies here use to be
the bankers of their servants and to have their gold in keeping

Wild This is the least trial you could have made of me I have some
three hundred pistoles by me those Ill send by my servant

Jac Confess freely you mistrust me But if you find the least qualm
about your gold pray keep it for a cordial

Wild The cordial must be applied to the heart and mines with you
madam Well I say no more but these are dangerous beginnings for
holding on I find my month will have more than oneandthirty days
int

Enter BEATRIX running

Beat Madam your father calls in haste for you
and is looking for you about the house

Jac Adieu servant be a good manager of your stock of love that it
may hold out your month I am afraid youll waste so much of it before
tomorrow night that youll shine but with a quarter moon upon me

Wild It shall be a crescent
                                 Exeunt WILD and JAC severally
                  BEATRIX is going and MASKALL runs and stops her

Mask Pay your ransom you are my prisoner

Beat What do you fight after the French fashion take towns before
you declare a war

Mask I shall be glad to imitate them so far to be in the middle of
the country before you could resist me

Beat Well what composition monsieur

Mask Deliver up your ladys secret what makes her so cruel to my
master

Beat Which of my ladies and which of your masters For I suppose
we are factors for both of them

Mask Your eldest lady Theodosia

Beat How dare you press your mistress to an inconvenience

Mask My mistress I understand not that language
the fortune of the valet ever follows that of the master and his is
desperate if his fate were altered for the better I should not care if
I ventured upon you for the worse

Beat I have told you already Donna Theodosia loves another

Mask Has he no name

Beat Let it suffice he is born noble though without a fortune His
poverty makes him conceal his love from her father but she sees him
every night in private and to blind the world about a fortnight ago
he took a solemn leave of her as if he were going into Flanders In the
mean time he lodges at the house of Don Lopez de Gamboa and is himself
called Don Melchor de Guzman

Mask Don Melchor de Guzman O heavens

Beat What amazes you

Theo Within Why Beatrix where are you

Beat You hear I am calledAdieu and be sure you keep my counsel

Mask Come sir you see the coast is clear
                                                           Exit BEAT

Enter BELLAMY

Bel Clear dost thou say No tis full of rocks and quicksands Yet
nothing vexes me so much as that she is in love with such a poor rogue

Mask But that she should lodge privately in the same house with us
twas oddly contrived of fortune

Bel Hang him rogue methinks I see him perching like an owl by
day and not daring to flutter out till moonlight The rascal invents
love and brews his compliments all day and broaches them at night
just as some of our dry wits do their stories before they come into
company Well if I could be revenged on either of them

Mask Here she comes again with Beatrix but good sir moderate your
passion

Enter THEODOSIA and BEATRIX

Bel Nay madam you are known and must not pass till I have spoken
with you
                                    BEL lifts up THEODOSIAS veil

Theo This rudeness to a person of my quality may cost you dear Pray
when did I give you encouragement for so much familiarity

Bel When you scorned me in the chapel

Theo The truth is I denied you as heartily as I could that I might
not be twice troubled with you

Bel Yet you have not this aversion for all the world However I was
in hope though the day frowned the night might prove as propitious to
me as it is to others

Theo I have now a quarrel both to the sun and moon because I have
seen you both by their lights

Bel Spare the moon I beseech you madam she is a very trusty planet
to you

Beat O Maskall you have ruined me

Mask Dear sir hold yet

Bel Away

Theo Pray sir expound your meaning for I confess I am in the
dark

Bel Methinks you should discover it by moonlight Or if you would
have me speak clearer to you give me leave to wait on you at a midnight
assignation and that it may not be discovered Ill feign a voyage
beyond sea as if I were going a captaining to Flanders

Mask A pox on his memory he has not forgot one syllable

Theo Ah Beatrix you have betrayed and sold me

Beat You have betrayed and sold yourself madam by your own rashness
to confess it heaven knows I have served you but too faithfully

Theo Peace impudence and see my face no more

Mask Do you know what work you have made sir

Bel Let her see what she has got by slighting me

Mask You had best let Beatrix be turned away for me to keep If you
do I know whose purse shall pay fort

Bel Thats a curse I never thought on Cast about quickly and save
all yet Range quest and spring a lie immediately

Theo To BEAT Never importune me farther you shall go theres no
removing me

Beat Well this is ever the reward of innocence
                                                               Going

Mask Stay guiltless virgin stay thou shalt not go

Theo Why who should hinder it

Mask That will I in the name of truthif this hardbound lie would
but come from me
                                                               Aside
Madam I must tell you it lies in my power to appease this tempest with
one word

Beat Would it were come once

Mask Nay sir tis all one to me if you turn me away upont I can
hold no longer

Theo What does the fellow mean

Mask For all your noddings and your mathematical grimacesin short
madam my master has been conversing with the planets and from them has
had the knowledge of your affairs

Bel This rogue amazes me

Mask I care not sir I am for truth that will shame you and all
your devils In short madam this master of mine that stands before
you without a word to say for himself so like an oaf as I might say
with reverence to him

Bel The rascal makes me mad

Mask Is the greatest astrologer in Christendom

Theo Your master an astrologer

Mask A most profound one

Bel Why you dog you do not consider what an improbable lie this is
which you know I can never make good Disgorge it you cormorant or
Ill pinch your throat out
                                             Takes him by the throat

Mask Tis all in vain sir you are and shall be an astrologer
whatever I suffer you know all things see into all things foretell
all things and if you pinch more truth out of me I will confess you
are a conjurer

Bel How sirrah a conjurer

Mask I mean sir the devil is in your fingers Own ityou had best
sir and do not provoke me farther While he is speaking BELLAMY
stops his mouth by fits What did not I see you an hour ago turning
over a great folio with strange figures in it and then muttering to
yourself like any poet and then naming Theodosia and then staring up
in the sky and then poring upon the ground so that betwixt God and
the devil madam he came to know your love

Bel Madam if ever I knew the least term in astrology I am the
arrantest son of a whore breathing

Beat O sir for that matter you shall excuse my lady Nay hide
your talents if you can sir

Theo The more you pretend ignorance the more we are resolved to
believe you skilful

Bel Youll hold your tongue yet
                                                             To MASK

Mask You shall never make me hold my tongue except you conjure me to
silence What did you not call me to look into a crystal and there
shewed me a fair garden and a Spaniard stalking in his narrow
breeches and walking underneath a window I should know him again
amongst a thousand

Beat Don Melchor in my conscience madam

Bel This rogue will invent more stories of me than eer were
fathered upon Lilly

Mask Will you confess then do you think Ill stain my honour to
swallow a lie for you

Bel Well a pox on you I am an astrologer

Beat O are you so sir

Theo I hope then learned sir as you have been
curious in enquiring into my secrets you will be so much a cavalier as
to conceal them

Bel You need not doubt me madam I am more in your power than you
can be in mine Besides if I were once known in town the next thing
for aught I know would be to bring me before the fathers of the
inquisition

Beat Well madam what do you think of me now I have betrayed you I
have sold you how can you ever make me amends for this imputation I
did not think you could have used me so
                                   Cries and claps her hands at her

Theo Nay prythee Beatrix do not cry Ill
leave off my new gown tomorrow and thou shalt have it

Beat No Ill cry eternally you have taken away my good name from
me and you can never make me recompenceexcept you give me your new
gorget too

Theo No more words thou shalt have it girl

Beat O madam your father has surprised us

Enter DON ALONZO and frowns

Bel Then Ill begone to avoid suspicion

Theo By your favour sir you shall stay a little the happiness of
so rare an acquaintance ought to be cherished on my side by a longer
conversation

Alon Theodosia what business have you with this cavalier

Theo That sir which will make you as ambitious of being known to
him as I have been Under the habit of a gallant he conceals the
greatest astrologer this day living

Alon You amaze me daughter

Theo For my own part I have been consulting with him about some
particulars of my fortunes past and future both which he has resolved
me with that admirable knowledge

Bel Yes faith sir I was foretelling her of a disaster that
severely threatened her Andone thing I foresee already by my stars
that I must bear up boldly or I am lost
                                                               Aside

Mask To BEL Never fear him sir hes an
ignorant fellow and credulous I warrant him

Alon Daughter be not too confident in your belief theres nothing
more uncertain than the old prophecies of these Nostradamusses but of
what nature was the question which you asked him

Theo What should be my fortune in marriage

Alon And pray what did you answer sir

Bel I answered her the truth that she is in danger of marrying a
gentleman without a fortune

Theo And this sir has put me in such a fright

Alon Never trouble yourself about it daughter follow my advice and
I warrant you a rich husband

Bel But the stars say she shall not follow your advice If it happens
otherwise Ill burn my folio volumes and my manuscripts too I assure
you that sir

Alon Be not too confident young man I know
somewhat in astrology myself for in my younger
years I studied it and though I say it made
some small proficiency in it

Bel Marry heaven forbid
                                                               Aside

Alon And I could only find it was no way demonstrative but
altogether fallacious

Mask On what a rock have we split ourselves

Bel Now my ignorance will certainly come out

Beat Sir remember you are old and crazy sir and if the evening air
should take youbeseech you sir retire

Alon Knowledge is to be preferred before health I must needs discuss
a point with this learned cavalier concerning a difficult question in
that art which almost gravels me

Mask How I sweat for him Beatrix and myself too who have brought
him into this prmunire

Beat You must be impudent for our old man will stick like a burr to
you now hes in a dispute

Alon What judgment may a man reasonably form from the trine aspect of
the two infortunes in angular houses

Bel Thats a matter of nothing sir Ill turn my man loose to you
for such a question
                                              Puts MASKALL forward

Alon Come on sir I am the qurent

Mask Meaning me sir I vow to God and your worship knows it I
never made that science my study in the least sir

Bel The gleanings of mine are enough for that Why you impudent
rogue you hold forth your gifts or IllWhat a devil must I be
pestered with every trivial question when theres not a master in town
of any science but has his usher for these mean offices

Theo Try him in some deeper question sir you see he will not put
himself forth for this

Alon Then Ill be more abstruse with him What think you sir of the
taking Hyleg or of the best way of rectification for a nativity Have
you been conversant in the Centiloquium of Trismegistus What think you
of Mars in the tenth when tis his own house or of Jupiter
configurated with malevolent planets

Bel I thought what your skill was to answer your question in two
words Mars rules over the martial and Jupiter over the jovial and so
of the rest sir

Alon This every schoolboy could have told me

Bel Why then you must not ask such schoolboys questions But your
carcase sirrah shall pay for this
                                                    Aside to MASKALL

Alon You seem not to understand the terms sir

Bel By your favour sir I know there are five of them do not I know
your Michaelmas your Hillary your Easter your Trinity and your Long
Vocation term sir

Alon I do not understand a word of this jargon

Bel It may be not sir I believe the terms are not the same in Spain
they are in England

Mask Did one ever hear so impudent an ignorance

Alon The terms of art are the same every where

Bel Tell me that you are an old man and they are altered since you
studied them

Alon That may be I must confess however if you please to discourse
something of the art to me you shall find me an apt scholar

Enter a Servant to ALONZO

Ser Sir
                                                            Whispers

Alon Sir I am sorry a business of importance
calls me hence but Ill wait on you some other time to discourse more
at large of astrology

Bel Is your business very pressing

Alon It is I assure you sir

Bel I am very sorry for I should have instructed you in such rare
secrets I have no fault but that I am too communicative

Alon Ill dispatch my business and return immediately come away
daughter
                                 Exeunt ALON THEO BEAT and Serv

Bel A devil on his learning he had brought me to
my last legs I was fighting as low as ever was Squire Widdrington

Mask Who would have suspected it from that wicked elder

Bel Suspected it why twas palpable from his very physiognomy he
looks like Haly and the spirit Fircue in the fortunebook

Enter WILDBLOOD

Wild How now Bellamy in wrath prythee whats the matter

Bel The story is too long to tell you but this rogue here has made
me pass for an arrant fortuneteller

Mask If I had not I am sure he must have passed for an arrant mad
man he had discovered in a rage all that Beatrix had confessed to me
concerning her mistresss love and I had no other way to bring him off
but to say he knew it by the planets

Wild And art thou such an oaf to be vexed at this as the adventure
may be managed it may make the most pleasant one in all the carnival

Bel Death I shall have all Madrid about me in these two days

Wild Nay all Spain ifaith as fast as I can divulge thee Not a
ship shall pass out from any port but shall ask thee for a wind thou
shalt have all the trade of Lapland within a month

Bel And do you think it reasonable for me to stand defendant to all
the impertinent questions that the town can ask me

Wild Thou shalt dot boy Pox on thee thou dost not know thine own
happiness thou wilt have the ladies come to thee and if thou dost not
fit them with fortunes thou art bewitched

Mask Sir tis the easiest thing in nature you need but speak
doubtfully or keep yourself in general terms and for the most part
tell good rather than bad fortune

Wild And if at any time thou venturest at particulars have an
evasion ready like Lilly as thusIt will infallibly happen if our
sins hinder notI would undertake with one of his almanacks to give
very good content to all Christendom and what good luck fell not out in
one kingdom should in another

Mask The pleasure ont will be to see how all his customers will
contribute to their own deceiving and verily believe he told them that
which they told him

Bel Umph now I begin to taste it I am like the drunken tinker in
the play a great prince and never knew it

Wild A great prince a great Turk we shall have thee within these
two days do grace to the ladies by throwing out a handkerchief life
I could feast upon thy fragments

Bel If the women come you shall be sure to help me to undergo the
burden for though you make me an astronomer I am no Atlas to bear
all upon my back But who are these

Enter Musicians with disguises and some in their hands

Wild You know the men if their masking habits were off they are the
music of our ambassadors retinue My project is to give our mistress a
serenade this being the last evening of the carnival and to prevent
discovery here are disguises for us too

Bel Tis very well come Maskall help on with them while they tune
their instruments

Wild Strike up gentlemen well entertain them with a song a
lAngloise pray be ready with your chorus


                    SONG

      After the pangs of a desperate lover
    When day and night I have sighed all in vain
      Ah what a pleasure it is to discover
    In her eyes pity who causes my pain

      When with unkindness our love at a stand is
    And both have punished ourselves with the pain
      Ah what a pleasure the touch of her hand is
    Ah what a pleasure to press it again

      When the denial comes fainter and fainter
    And her eyes give what her tongue does deny
      Ah what a trembling I feel when I venture
    Ah what a trembling does usher my joy

      When with a sigh she accords me the blessing
    And her eyes twinkle twixt pleasure and pain
      Ah what a joy tis beyond all expressing
    Ah what a joy to hearshall we again

THEODOSIA and JACINTHA above JACINTHA throws down her
handkerchief with a favour tied to it

Jac Ill musicians must be rewarded There cavalier tis to buy your
silence
                                             Exeunt women from above

Wild By this light which at present is scarce an oath an
handkerchief and a favour
            Music and guittars tuning on the other side of the Stage

Bel Hark Wildblood do you hear Theres more melody On my life
some Spaniards have taken up this post for the same design

Wild Ill be with their catguts immediately

Bel Prythee be patient we shall lose the sport else

Don LOPEZ and Don MELCHOR disguised with Servants and Musicians on
the other side

Wild Tis some rival of yours or mine Bellamy for he addresses to
this window

Bel Damn him lets fall on then

 The two Spaniards and the English fight The Spaniards are beaten off
   the Stage the Musicians on both sides and Servants fall confusedly
   one over the other They all get off only MASKALL remains upon the
   ground

Mask Rising So alls past and I am safe A pox on these
fighting masters of mine to bring me into this danger with their
valours and magnanimities When I go aserenading again with them Ill
give them leave to make fiddlestrings of my smallguts

To him Don LOPEZ

Lop Who goes there

Mask Tis Don Lopez by his voice

Lop The same and by yours you should belong to my two English
guests Did you hear no tumult hereabouts

Mask I heard a clashing of swords and men a fighting

Lop I had my share int but how came you here

Mask I came hither by my masters order to see if you were in any
danger

Lop But how could he imagine I was in any

Mask Tis all one for that sir he knew it byHeaven what was I
a going to say I had like to have discovered all

Lop I find there is some secret int and you dare not trust me

Mask If you will swear on your honour to be very secret I will tell
you

Lop As I am a cavalier and by my beard I will

Mask Then in few words he knew it by astrology or magic

Lop You amaze me Is he conversant in the occult sciences

Mask Most profoundly

Lop I always thought him an extraordinary person but I could never
imagine his head lay that way

Mask He shewed me yesterday in a glass a ladys maid at London
whom I well knew and with whom I used to converse on a pallet in a
drawingroom while he was paying his devotions to her lady in the
bedchamber

Lop Lord what a treasure for a state were here and how much might
we save by this man in foreign intelligence

Mask And just now he shewed me how you were assaulted in the dark by
foreigners

Lop Could you guess what countrymen

Mask I imagined them to be Italians

Lop Not unlikely for they played most furiously at our backsides

Mask I will return to my master with the good news of your safety
but once again be secret or disclose it to none but friendsSo
theres one woodcock more in the springe
                                                                Exit

Lop Yes I will be very secret for I will tell it only to one
person but she is a woman I will to Aurelia and acquaint her with the
skill of this rare artist She is curious as all women are and tis
probable will desire to look into the glass to see Don Melchor whom
she believes absent so that by this means without breaking my oath to
him he will be discovered to be in town Then his intrigue with
Theodosia will come to light too for which Aurelia will I hope
discard him and receive me I will about it instantly

Success in love on diligence depends No lazy lover eer attained his
ends
                                                                Exit




ACT III SCENE I


Enter BELLAMY and MASKALL

Bel Then they were certainly Don Lopez and Don Melchor with whom we
fought

Mask Yes sir

Bel And when you met Lopez he swallowed all you told him

Mask As greedily as if it had been a new saints miracle

Bel I see twill spread

Mask And the fame of it will be of use to you in your next amour for
the women you know run mad after fortunetellers and preachers

Bel But for all my bragging this amour is not yet worn off I find
constancy and once a night come naturally upon a man towards thirty
only we set a face ont and call ourselves inconstant for our
reputation

Mask But what say the stars sir

Bel They move faster than you imagine for I have got me an argol
and an English almanack by help of which in one half hour I have
learned to cant with an indifferent good grace Conjunction opposition
trine square and sextile are now no longer bugbears to me I thank my
stars fort

Enter WILDBLOOD

Monsieur Wildblood in good time What you have been taking pains too
to divulge my talent

Wild So successfully that shortly there will be no talk in town but
of you only Another miracle or two and a sharp sword and you stand
fair for a new prophet

Bel But where did you begin to blow the trumpet

Wild In the gaminghouse where I found most of the townwits the
prosewits playing and the versewits rooking

Bel All sorts of gamesters are so superstitious that I need not
doubt of my reception there

Wild From thence I went to the latter end of a comedy and there
whispered it to the next man I knew who had a woman by him

Mask Nay then it went like a train of powder if once they had it
by the end

Wild Like a squib upon a line ifaith it ran through one row and
came back upon me in the next At my going out I met a knot of
Spaniards who were formally listening to one who was relating it but
he told the story so ridiculously with his marginal notes upon it
that I was forced to contradict him

Bel Twas discreetly done

Wild Ay for you but not for me What says he must such Borachos
as you take upon you to vilify a man of science I tell you hes of my
intimate acquaintance and I have known him long for a prodigious
personWhen I saw my Don so fierce I thought it not wisdom to quarrel
for so slight a matter as your reputation and so withdrew

Bel A pox of your success now shall I have my chamber besieged
tomorrow morning There will be no stirring out for me but I must be
fain to take up their questions in a cleftcane or a beggingbox as
they do charity in prisons

Wild Faith I cannot help what your learning
has brought you to Go in and study I foresee you will have but few
holidays In the mean time Ill not fail to give the world an account
of your endowments Farewell Ill to the gaminghouse
                                                           Exit WILD

Mask O sir here is the rarest adventure and which is more come
home to you

Bel What is it

Mask A fair lady and her woman wait in the outer room to speak with
you

Bel But how know you she is fair

Mask Her woman plucked up her veil when she spoke to me so that
having seen her this evening I know her mistress to be Donna Aurelia
cousin to your mistress Theodosia and who lodges in the same house with
her She wants a star or two I warrant you

Bel My whole constellation is at her service But what is she for a
woman

Mask Fair enough as Beatrix has told me but sufficiently
impertinent She is one of those ladies who make ten visits in an
afternoon and entertain her they see with speaking ill of the last
from whom they parted In few words she is one of the greatest
coquettes in Madrid and to shew she is one she cannot speak ten words
without some affected phrase that is in fashion

Bel For my part I can suffer any impertinence from a woman provided
she be handsome My business is with her beauty not with her morals
let her confessor look to them

Mask I wonder what she has to say to you

Bel I know not but I sweat for fear I should be gravelled

Mask Venture out of your depth and plunge boldly sir I warrant you
will swim

Bel Do not leave me I charge you but when I look mournfully upon
you help me out

Enter AURELIA and CAMILLA

  Mask Here they are already
                                             AUR plucks up her veil

Aur How am I dressed tonight Camilla is nothing disordered in my
head

Cam Not the least hair madam

Aur No let me see Give me the counsellor of the graces

Cam The counsellor of the graces madam

Aur My glass I mean What will you never be so spiritual as to
understand refined language

Cam Madam

Aur Madam me no madam but learn to retrench your words and say
maam as yes maam and no maam as other ladies women do Madam
tis a year in pronouncing

Cam Pardon me madam

Aur Yet again ignorance Pardon madam fie fie what a
superfluity is there and how much sweeter the cadence isparn me
maam and for your ladyship your lashipOut upont what a furious
indigence of ribbands is here upon my head This dress is a libel to my
beauty a mere lampoon Would any one that had the least revenue of
common sense have done this

Cam Maam the cavalier approaches your laship

Bel to Mask Maskall pump the woman and see if you can discover
any thing to save my credit

Aur Out upon it now I should speak I want assurance

Bel Madam I was told you meant to honour me with your commands

Aur I believe sir you wonder at my confidence in this visit but I
may be excused for waving a little modesty to know the only person of
the age

Bel I wish my skill were more to serve you madam

Aur Sir you are an unfit judge of your own merits For my own part
I confess I have a furious inclination for the occult sciences but at
present tis my misfortune
                                                               Sighs

Bel But why that sigh madam

Aur You might spare me the shame of telling you since I am sure you
can divine my thoughts I will therefore tell you nothing

Bel What the devil will become of me now
                                                               Aside

Aur You may give me an essay of your science by declaring to me the
secret of my thoughts

Bel If I know your thoughts madam tis in vain for you to disguise
them to me Therefore as you tender your own satisfaction lay them
open without bashfulness

Aur I beseech you let us pass over that chapter for I am shamefaced
to the last point Since therefore I cannot put off my modesty
succour it and tell me what I think

Bel Madam madam that bashfulness must be laid aside Not but that I
know your business perfectly and will if you please unfold it to you
all immediately

Aur Favour me so far I beseech you sir for I furiously desire it

Bel But then I must call up before you a most dreadful spirit with
head upon head and horns upon horns Therefore consider how you can
endure it

Aur This is furiously furious but rather than fail of my
expectances Ill try my assurance

Bel Well then I find you will force me to this unlawful and
abominable act of conjuration Remember the sin is yours too

Aur I espouse the crime also

Bel I see when a woman has a mind tot shell never boggle at a
sin Pox on her what shall I do AsideWell Ill tell you your
thoughts madam but after that expect no farther service from me for
tis your confidence must make my art successfulWell you are
obstinate then I must tell you your thoughts

Aur Hold hold sir I am content to pass over that chapter rather
than be deprived of your assistance

Bel Tis very well what need these circumstances between us two
Confess freely is not love your business

Aur You have touched me to the quick sir

Bel Look you there you see I knew it nay Ill tell you more tis
a man you love

Aur O prodigious science I confess I love a man most furiously to
the last point sir

Bel Now proceed lady your way is open I am resolved Ill not tell
you a word farther

Aur Well then since I must acquaint you with what you know much
better than myself I will tell you I loved a cavalier who was noble
young and handsome this gentleman is since gone for Flanders now
whether he has preserved his passion inviolate or not is that which
causes my inquietude

Bel Trouble not yourself madam hes as constant as a romance hero

Aur Sir your good news has ravished me most furiously but that I
may have a confirmation of it I beg only that you would lay your
commands upon his genius or idea to appear to me this night that I
may have my sentence from his mouth This sir I know is a slight
effect of your science and yet will infinitely oblige me

Bel What the devil does she call a slight effect AsideWhy
lady do you consider what you say you desire me to shew you a man
whom yourself confess to be in Flanders

Aur To view him in a glass is nothing I would speak with him in
person I mean his idea sir

Bel Ay but madam there is a vast sea betwixt us and Flanders and
water is an enemy to conjuration A witchs horse you know when he
enters into water returns into a bottle of hay again

Aur But sir I am not so ill a geographer or to speak more
properly a chorographer as not to know there is a passage by land from
hence to Flanders

Bel Thats true madam but magic works in a direct line Why should
you think the devil such an ass to go about Gad hell not stir a step
out of his road for you or any man

Aur Yes for a lady sir I hope hes a person that wants not that
civility for a lady especially a spirit that has the honour to belong
to you sir

Bel For that matter hes your servant madam but his education has
been in the fire and hes naturally an enemy to water I assure you

Aur I beg his pardon for forgetting his antipathy but it imports
not much sir for I have lately received a letter from my servant that
he is yet in Spain and stays for a wind in St Sebastians

Bel Now I am lost past all redemptionMaskall must you be
smickering after wenches while I am in calamity
                                                               Aside

Mask It must be he Ill venture ont AsideAlas sir I was
complaining to myself of the condition of poor Don Melchor who you
know is windbound at St Sebastians

Bel Why you impudent villain must you offer to name him publicly
when I have taken so much care to conceal him all this while

Aur Mitigate your displeasure I beseech you and without making
farther testimony of it gratify my expectances

Bel Well madam since the sea hinders not you shall have your
desire Look upon me with a fixed eyesoor a little more
amorously if you pleasegood Now favour me with your hand

Aur Is it absolutely necessary you should press my hand thus

Bel Furiously necessary I assure you madam for now I take
possession of it in the name of the idea of Don Melchor Now madam I
am farther to desire of you to write a note to his genius wherein you
desire him to appear and this we men of art call a compact with the
ideas

Aur I tremble furiously

  Bel Give me your hand Ill guide it
                                                          They write

Mask to Cam Now lady mine what think you of my master

Cam I think I would not serve him for the world Nay if he can know
our thoughts by looking on us we women are hypocrites to little
purpose

Mask He can do that and more for by casting his eyes but once upon
them he knows whether they are maids better than a whole jury of
midwives

Cam Now heaven defend me from him

Mask He has a certain small familiar which he carries still about
him that never fails to make discovery

Cam See they have done writing not a word more for fear he knows
my voice

Bel One thing I had forgot madam you must subscribe your name to
it

Aur There tis farewell cavalier keep your promise for I expect
it furiously

  Cam If he sees me I am undone
                                                     Hiding her face

Bel Camilla

Cam starts and shrieks Ah he has found me I am ruined

Bel You hide your face in vain for I see into your heart

Cam Then sweet sir have pity on my frailty for if my lady has the
least inkling of what we did last night the poor coachman will be
turned away
                                                 Exit after her Lady

Mask Well sir how like you your new profession

Bel Would I were well quit ont I sweat all over

Mask But what fainthearted devils yours are that will not go by
water Are they all Lancashire devils of the brood of Tybert and
Grimalkin that they dare not wet their feet

Bel Mine are honest land devils good plain footposts that beat
upon the hoof for me But to save their labour here take this and in
some disguise deliver it to Don Melchor

Mask Ill serve it upon him within this hour when he sallies out to
his assignation with Theodosia Tis but counterfeiting my voice a
little for he cannot know me in the dark But let me see what are the
words

Reads Don Melchor if the magic of love have any power upon your
spirit I conjure you to appear this night before me You may guess the
greatness of my passion since it has forced me to have recourse to art
but no shape which resembles you can fright
                                                               AURELIA

Bel Well I am glad theres one point gained for by this means he
will be hindered tonight from entertaining TheodosiaPox on him is
he here again

Enter Don ALONZO

Alon Cavalier Inglis I have been seeking you
I have a present in my pocket for you read it by your art and take it

Bel That I could do easily But to shew you I am generous Ill none
of your present do you think I am mercenary

Alon I know you will say now tis some astrological question and so
tis perhaps

Bel Ay tis the devil of a question without dispute

Alon No tis within dispute Tis a certain difficulty in the art
a problem which you and I will discuss with the arguments on both
sides

Bel At this time I am not problematically given I have a humour of
complaisance upon me and will contradict no man

Alon Well but discuss a little

Bel By your favour Ill not discuss for I see by the stars that
if I dispute today I am infallibly threatened to be thought ignorant
all my life after

Alon Well then well but cast an eye together upon my eldest
daughters nativity

Bel Nativity

Alon I know what you would say now that there wants the table of
direction for the five hylegiacalls the ascendant medium coeli sun
moon and stars But well take it as it is

Bel Never tell me that sir

Alon I know what you would say again sir

Bel Tis well you do for Ill be sworn I do not
                                                               Aside

Alon You would say sir

Bel I say sir there is no doing without the sun and moon and all
that sir and so you may make use of your paper for your occasions
Come to a man of art without the sun and moon and all that sir
                                                            Tears it

Alon Tis no matter this shall break no squares betwixt us
Gathers up the torn papers I know what you would say now that men
of parts are always choleric I know it by myself sir
                                         He goes to match the papers

Enter Don LOPEZ

Lop Don Alonzo in my house this is a most happy opportunity to put
my other design in execution for if I can persuade him to bestow his
daughter on Don Melchor I shall serve my friend though against his
will and when Aurelia sees she cannot be his perhaps she will accept
my love

Alon I warrant you sir tis all pieced right both top sides and
bottom for look you sir here was Aldeboran and there Cor
Scorpii

Lop Don Alonzo I am happy to see you under my roof and shall take
it

Alon I know what you would say sir that though I am your neighbour
this is the first time I have been hereTo BELLAMY But come
sir by Don Lopez permission let us return to our nativity

Bel Would thou wert there in thy mothers belly again
                                                               Aside

Lop But sennor
                                                           To ALONZO

Alon It needs not sennor Ill suppose your compliment you would
say that your house and all things in it are at my serviceBut let
us proceed without this interruption

Bel By no means sir this cavalier is come on purpose to perform the
civilities of his house to you

Alon But good sir

Bel I know what you would say sir
                                        Exeunt BELLAMY and MASKALL

Lop No matter let him go sir I have long desired
this opportunity to move a suit to you in the behalf of a friend of
mine if you please to allow me the hearing of it

Alon With all my heart sir

Lop He is a person of worth and virtue and is infinitely ambitious
of the honour

Alon Of being known to me I understand you sir

Lop If you will please to favour me with your patience which I beg
of you a second time

Alon I am dumb sir

Lop This cavalier of whom I was speaking is in love

Alon Satisfy yourself sir Ill not interrupt you

Lop Sir I am satisfied of your promise

Alon If I speak one syllable more the devil take me Speak when you
please

Lop I am going sir

Alon You need not speak twice to me to be silent Though I take it
somewhat ill of you to be tutored

  Lop This eternal old man will make me mad
                                                               Aside

Alon Why when do you begin sir How long must a man wait for you
Pray make an end of what you have to say quickly that I may speak in my
turn too

Lop This cavalier is in love

Alon You told me that before sir do you speak oracles that you
require this strict attention Either let me share the talk with you or
I am gone

Lop Why sir I am almost mad to tell you and you will not suffer
me

Alon Will you never have done sir I must tell you sir you have
tattled long enough and tis now good manners to hear me speak Heres
a torrent of words indeed a very impetus dicendi will you never have
done

Lop I will be heard in spite of you

    This next speech of LOPEZ and the next of ALONZOS with both
  their replies are to be spoken at one time both raising their voices
 by little and little till they bawl and come up close to shoulder one
 another

Lop Theres one Don Melchor de Guzman a friend and acquaintance of
mine that is desperately in love with your eldest daughter Donna
Theodosia

Alon At the same time Tis the sentence of a philosopher
Loquere ut te videam speak that I may know thee now if you take
away the power of speaking from me
                      Both pause a little then speak together again

Lop Ill try the language of the law sure the devil cannot outtalk
that gibberishFor this Don Melchor of Madrid aforesaid as premised
I request move and supplicate that you would give bestow marry and
give in marriage this your daughter aforesaid to the cavalier
aforesaidNot yet thou devil of a man thou shalt be silent
                                                Exit LOPEZ running

Alon At the same time with LOPEZS last speech and after LOPEZ
is run out Oh how I hate abominate detest and abhor these
perpetual talkers disputants controverters and duellers of the
tongue But on the other side if it be not permitted to prudent men to
speak their minds appositely and to the purpose and in few words if
I say the prudent must be tonguetied then let great nature be
destroyed let the order of all things be turned topsyturvy let the
goose devour the fox let the infants preach to their greatgrandsires
let the tender lamb pursue the wolf and the sick prescribe to the
physician let fishes live upon dry land and the beasts of the earth
inhabit in the water let the fearful hare

Enter LOPEZ with a bell and rings it in his ears

  Alon Help help murder murder murder
                                              Exit ALONZO running

Lop There was no way but this to be rid of him

Enter a Servant

Serv Sir there are some women without in masquerade and I
believe persons of quality who are come to play here

Lop Bring them in with all respect

Enter again the Servant after him JACINTHA BEATRIX and other
Ladies and Gentlemen all masqued

Lop Cavaliers and ladies you are welcome I wish I had more company
to entertain youOh here comes one sooner than I expected

Enter WILDBLOOD and MASKALL

  Wild I have swept your gaming house ifaith Ecce signum
                                                          Shows gold

Lop Well heres more to be had of these ladies if it be your
fortune

Wild The first stakes I would play for should be their veils and
visor masks

Jac to Beat Do you think he will not know us

Beat If you keep your design of passing for an African

Jac Well now I shall make an absolute trial of him for being thus
incognita I shall discover if he make love to any of you As for the
gallantry of his serenade we will not be indebted to him for we will
make him another with our guitars

Beat Ill whisper your intention to the servant who shall deliver it
to Don Lopez
                                          BEAT whispers to the Serv

Serv to Lopez Sir the ladies have commanded me to tell you that
they are willing before they play to present you with a dance and to
give you an essay of their guitars

Lop They much honour me

A DANCE

After the dance the Cavaliers take the Ladies and court them
WILDBLOOD takes JACINTHA

Wild While you have been singing lady I have been praying I mean
that your face and wit may not prove equal to your dancing for if they
be theres a heart gone astray to my knowledge

Jac If you pray against me before you have seen me youll curse me
when you have looked on me

Wild I believe I shall have cause to do so if your beauty be as
killing as I imagine it

Jac Tis true I have been flattered in my own country with an
opinion of a little handsomeness but how it will pass in Spain is a
question

Wild Why madam are you not of Spain

Jac No sir of Morocco I only came hither to
see some of my relations who are settled here and turned Christians
since the expulsion of my countrymen the Moors

Wild Are you then a Mahometan

Jac A Mussulman at your service

Wild A Mussulwoman say you I protest by your voice I should have
taken you for a Christian lady of my acquaintance

Jac It seems you are in love then If so I have done with you I
dare not invade the dominions of another lady especially in a country
where my ancestors have been so unfortunate

Wild Some little liking I might have but that was only a
morningdew tis drawn up by the sunshine of your beauty I find your
African Cupid is a much surer archer than ours of Europe Yet would I
could see you one look would secure your victory

Jac Ill reserve my face to gratify your imagination with it make
what head you please and set it on my shoulders

Wild Well madam an eye a nose or a lip shall break no squares
The face is but a spans breadth of beauty and where there is so much
besides Ill never stand with you for that

Jac But in earnest do you love me

Wild Ay by Alla do I most extremely You have wit in abundance
you dance to a miracle you sing like an angel and I believe you look
like a cherubim

Jac And can you be constant to me

Wild By Mahomet can I

Jac You swear like a Turk sir but take heed for our prophet is a
severe punisher of promise breakers

Wild Your prophets a cavalier I honour your prophet and his law
for providing so well for us lovers in the other world black eyes and
fresh maidenheads every day go thy way little Mahomet ifaith thou
shalt have my good word But by his favour lady give me leave to tell
you that we of the uncircumcised in a civil way as lovers have
somewhat the advantage of your mussulman

Jac The company are rejoined and set to play we must go to them
Adieu and when you have a thought to throw away bestow it on your
servant Fatima
                                             She goes to the company

Wild This lady Fatima pleases me most infinitely Now am I got among

Wildbloods make among the Cids and the Bens of the Arabians

Beat to Jac False or true madam

Jac False as hell but by heaven Ill fit him fort Have you the
highrunning dice about you

Beat I got them on purpose madam

Jac You shall see me win all their money and when I have done Ill
return in my own person and ask him for the money which he promised
me

Beat Twill put him upon a strait to be surprised But let us to the
table the company stays for us
                                                     The company sit

Wild What is the ladies game sir

Lop Most commonly they use raffle that is to throw with three dice
till duplets and a chance be thrown and the highest duplet wins
except you throw in and in which is called raffle and that wins all

Wild I understand it Come lady tis no matter what I lose the
greatest stake my heart is gone already
                                                         To JACINTHA

Wild So I have a good chance two quarters and a sice

Jac Two sixes and a trey wins it
                                                    Sweeps the money

Wild Tol de ra tol de rapox and cursetol de ra What the devil
did I mean to play with this brunette of Afric The Ladies rise
Will you be gone already ladies

Lop You have won our money but however we are acknowledging to you
for the honour of your company
                                JAC makes a sign of farewell to WILD

Wild Farewell lady Fatima
                                      Exeunt all but WILD and MASK

Mask All the company took notice of your concernment

Wild Tis no matter I do not love to fret inwardly as your silent
losers do and in the mean time be ready to choak for want of vent

Mask Pray consider your condition a little a younger brother in a
foreign country living at a high rate your money lost and without
hope of a supply Now curse if you think good

Wild No now I will laugh at myself most unmercifully for my
condition is so ridiculous that tis past cursing The pleasantest part
of the adventure is that I have promised three hundred pistoles to
Jacintha But there is no remedy they are now fair Fatimas

Mask Fatima

Wild Ay ay a certain African lady of my acquaintance whom you know
not

Mask But who is here sir

Enter JACINTHA and BEATRIX in their own shapes

Wild Madam what happy star has conducted you hither to nightA
thousand devils of this fortune
                                                               Aside

Jac I was told you had ladies here and fiddles so I came partly for
the divertisement and partly out of jealousy

Wild Jealousy Why sure you do not think me a pagan an infidel But
the companys broke up you see Am I to wait upon you home or will
you be so kind to take a hard lodging with me tonight

Jac You shall have the honour to lead me to my fathers

Wild No more words then lets away to prevent discovery

Beat For my part I think he has a mind to be rid of you

Wild No But if your lady should want sleep twould spoil the lustre
of her eyes tomorrow There were a conquest lost

Jac I am a peaceable princess and content with my own I mean your
heart and purse for the truth is I have lost my money tonight in
masquerade and am come to claim your promise of supplying me

Wild You make me happy by commanding me Tomorrow morning my servant
shall wait upon you with three hundred pistoles

Jac But I left my company with promise to return to play

Wild Play on tick and lose the Indies Ill discharge it all
tomorrow

Jac Tonight if youll oblige me

Wild Maskall go and bring me three hundred pistoles immediately

Mask Are you mad sir

Wild Do you expostulate you rascal How he stares Ill be hanged if
he have not lost my gold at play If you have confess you had best
and perhaps Ill pardon you but if you do not confess Ill have no
mercy Did you lose it

Mask Sir tis not for me to dispute with you

Wild Why then let me tell you you did lose it

Jac Ay as sure as eer he had it I dare swear for him But commend
me to you for a kind master that can let your servant play off three
hundred pistoles without the least sign of anger to him

Beat Tis a sign he has a greater bank in store to comfort him

Wild Well madam I must confess I have more than I will speak of at
this time but till you have given me satisfaction

Jac Satisfaction why are you offended sir

Wild Heaven that you should not perceive it in me I tell you I am
mortally offended with you

Jac Sure tis impossible

Wild You have done nothing I warrant to make a man jealous Going
out a gaming in masquerade at unseasonable hours and losing your money
at play that loss above all provokes me

Beat I believe you because she comes to you for more
                                                               Aside

Jac Is this the quarrel Ill clear it immediately

Wild Tis impossible you should clear it Ill stop my ears if you
but offer it Theres no satisfaction in the point

Jac Youll hear me

Wild To do this in the beginning of an amour and to a jealous
servant as I am had I all the wealth of Peru I would not let go one
maravedis to you

Jac To this I answer

Wild Answer nothing for it will but inflame the quarrel betwixt us
I must come to myself by little and little and when I am ready for
satisfaction I will take it But at present it is not for my honour to
be friends

Beat Pray let us neighbour princes interpose a little

Wild When I have conquered you may interpose but at present the
mediation of all Christendom would be fruitless

Jac Though Christendom can do nothing with you yet I hope an African
may prevail Let me beg you for the sake of the lady Fatima

Wild I begin to suspect that lady Fatima is no better than she
should be If she be turned Christian again I am undone

Jac By Alla I am afraid ont too By Mahomet I am

Wild Well well madam any man may be overtaken with an oath but I
never meant to perform it with her You know no oaths are to be kept
with infidels But

Jac No the love you made was certainly a design of charity you had
to reconcile the two religions Theres scarce such another man in
Europe to be sent apostle to convert the Moor ladies

Wild Faith I would rather widen their breaches than make them up

Jac I see theres no hope of a reconcilement with you and therefore
I give it over as desperate

Wild You have gained your point you have my money and I was only
angry because I did not know twas you who had it

Jac This will not serve your turn sir what I have got I have
conquered from you

Wild Indeed you use me like one thats conquered for you have
plundered me of all I had

Jac I only disarmed you for fear you should rebel again for if you
had the sinews of war I am sure you would be flying out

Wild Dare but to stay without a new servant till I am flush again
and I will love you and treat you and present you at that unreasonable
rate that I will make you an example to all unbelieving mistresses

Jac Well I will try you once more but you must make haste then
that we may be within our time methinks our love is drawn out so
subtle already that tis near breaking

Wild I will have more care of it on my part than the kindred of an
old pope have to preserve him

Jac Adieu for this time I wipe off your score till you are caught
tripping in some new amour
                                                        Exeunt Women

Mask You have used me very kindly sir I thank you

Wild You deserved it for not having a lie ready for my occasions A
good servant should be no more without it than a soldier without his
arms But prythee advise me whats to be done to get Jacintha

Mask You have lost her or will lose her by your submitting If we
men could but learn to value ourselves we should soon take down our
mistresses from all their altitudes and make them dance after our
pipes longer perhaps than we had a mind tot But I must make haste or
I shall lose Don Melchor

Wild Call Bellamy well both be present at thy enterprize Then Ill
once more to the gaminghouse with my small stock for my last refuge
If I win I have wherewithal to mollify Jacintha

  If I throw out Ill bear it off with huffing
  And snatch the money like a bullyruffin
                                                              Exeunt




ACT IV SCENE I


Enter BELLAMY WILDBLOOD MASKALL in a Visor

Bel Here comes one and in all probability it must be Don Melchor
going to Theodosia

Mask Stand close and you shall see me serve the writ upon him

Enter Don MELCHOR

Wild Now Maskall

Mask I stayed here sir by express order from the lady Aurelia to
deliver you this note and to desire you from her to meet her
immediately in the garden

Mel Do you hear friend

Mask Not a syllable more sir I have performed my orders
                                        MASK retires to his Masters

Mel Hes gone and tis in vain for me to look after him What
envious devil has discovered to Aurelia that I am in town It must be
Don Lopez who to advance his own pretensions to her has endeavoured
to ruin mine

Wild It works rarely

Mel But I am resolved to see Aurelia if it be but to defeat him
                                                            Exit MEL

Wild Lets make haste after him I long to see the end of this
adventure

Mask Sir I think I see some women coming yonder

Bel Well Ill leave you to your adventures while I prosecute my
own

Wild I warrant you have made an assignation to instruct some lady in
the mathematics

Bel Ill not tell you my design because if it does not succeed you
shall not laugh at me
                                                            Exit Bel

Enter BEATRIX and JACINTHA in the habit of a Mulatto

Wild Let us withdraw a little and see if they will come this way

Beat We are right madam tis certainly your Englishman and his
servant with him But why this second trial when you engaged to break
with him if he failed in the first

Jac Tis true he has been a little inconstant choleric or so

Beat And it seems you are not contented with those vices but are
searching him for more This is the folly of a bleeding gamester who
will obstinately pursue a losing hand

Jac On tother side you would have me throw up my cards before the
game be lost Let me make this one more trial when he has money
whether he will give it me and then if he fails

Beat Youll forgive him again

Jac Hes already in purgatory but the next offence shall put him in
the pit past all redemption prythee sing to draw him nearer Sure he
cannot know me in this disguise

Beat Make haste then for I have more irons in the fire When I have
done with you I have another assignation of my Lady Theodosias to Don
Melchor


  SONG

    Calm was the even and clear was the sky
      And the newbudding flowers did spring
    When all alone went Amyntas and I
      To hear the sweet nightingale sing
    I sate and he laid him down by me
      But scarcely his breath he could draw
    For when with a fear he began to draw near
      He was dashed with A ha ha ha ha

    He blushed to himself and lay still for a while
      And his modesty curbed his desire
    But strait I convinced all his fear with a smile
      Which added new flames to his fire

    O Sylvia said he you are cruel
      To keep your poor lover in awe
    Then once more he prest with his hand to my breast
      But was dashed with A ha ha ha ha

    I knew twas his passion that caused all his fear
      And therefore I pitied his case
    I whispered him softly Theres nobody near
      And laid my cheek close to his face
    But as he grew bolder and bolder
      A shepherd came by us and saw
    And just as our bliss we began with a kiss
      He laughed out with A ha ha ha ha

Wild If you dare be the Sylvia lady I have brought you a more
confident Amyntas than that bashful gentleman in your song
                                             Goes to lay hold of her

Jac Hold hold sir I am only an ambassadress sent you from a lady
I hope you will not violate the laws of nations

Wild I was only searching for your letters of credence but methinks
with that beauty you look more like a herald that comes to denounce war
to all mankind

Jac One of the ladies in the masque tonight has taken a liking to
you and sent you by me this purse of gold in recompence of that she
saw you lose

Wild And she expects in return of it that I should wait on her Ill
dotwhere lives she I am desperately in love with her

Jac Why can you love her unknown

Wild I have a bank of love to supply every ones occasions some for
her some for another and some for you charge what you will upon me
I pay all at sight and without questioning who brought the bill

Jac Heyday you dispatch your mistresses as fast as if you meant to
oerrun all womankind Sure you aim at the universalmonarchy

Wild Now I think ont I have a foolish fancy to send the lady a
taste of my love by thee

Jac Tis impossible your love should be so humble to descend to a
mulatto

Wild One would think so but I cannot help it Gad I think the
reason is because theres something more of sin in thy colour than in
ours I know not whats the matter but a turkeycock is not more
provoked at red than I bristle at the sight of black Come be kinder
to me Young and slip an opportunity Tis an evening lost out of your
life

Jac These fine things you have said over a thousand times your cold
compliments the cold pye of love which you serve up to every guest
whom you invite

Wild Come because thou art very moving heres part of the gold
which thou broughtst to corrupt me for thy lady Truth is I had
promised a sum to a Spanish lady but thy eyes have allured it from me

Jac Youll repent it tomorrow

Wild Let tomorrow starve or provide for himself as tonight has
done Tomorrow is a cheat in love and I will not trust it

Jac Ay but heaven that sees all things

Wild Heaven that sees all things will say nothing That is all
eyes and no tongue Et la lune et les estoilesyou know the song

Jac A poor slave as I am

Wild It has been always my humour to love downward I love to stoop
to my prey and to have it in my power to souse at when I please When
a man comes to a great lady he is fain to approach her with fear and
reverence methinks theres something of godliness int

Jac Yet I cannot believe but the meanness of my habit must needs
scandalize you

Wild I tell thee my friend and so forth that I exceedingly honour
coarse linen tis as proper sometimes in an under garment as a coarse
towel is to rub and scrub me

Jac Now I am altogether of the other side I can love no where but
above me Methinks the rattling of a coach and six sounds more
eloquently than the best harangue a wit could make me

Wild Do you make no more esteem of a wit then

Jac His commendations serve only to make others have a mind to me he
does but say grace to me like a chaplain and like him is the last
that shall fall on He ought to get no more by it than a poor
silkweaver does by the ribband which he works to make a gallant fine

Wild Then what is a gentleman to hope from you

Jac To be admitted to pass my time with while a better comes To be
the lowest step in my staircase for a knight to mount upon him and a
lord upon him and a marquis upon him and a duke upon him till I get
as high as I can climb

Wild For aught I see the great ladies have the appetites which you
slaves should have and you slaves the pride which ought to be in
ladies For I observe that all women of your condition are like women
of the playhouse still picking at each other who shall go the best
dressed and the richest habits till you work up one another by your
high flying as the heron and jerfalcon do If you cannot outshine
your fellow with one lover you fetch her up with another And in
short all you get by it is only to put finery out of countenance and
to make the ladies of quality go plain because they will avoid the
scandal of your bravery

Beat Running in Madam come away I hear company in the garden

Wild You are not going

Jac Yes to cry out a rape if you follow me

Wild However I am glad you have left your treasure behind you
Farewell fairy

Jac Farewell changelingCome Beatrix
                                                        Exeunt Women

Mask Do you know how you came by this money sir You think I
warrant that it came by fortune

Wild No sirrah I know it came by my own industry Did not I come
out diligently to meet this gold in the very way it was to come What
could fate do less for me They are such thoughtless and undesigning
rogues as you that make a drudge of poor Providence and set it a
shifting for you Give me a brave fellow like myself that if you throw
him down into the world lights every where upon his legs and helps
himself without being beholden to fate that is the hospital of fools

Mask But after all your jollity what think you if it was Jacintha
that gave it you in this disguise I am sure I heard her call Beatrix as
she went away

Wild Umh thou awakenst a most villainous apprehension in me
methought indeed I knew the voice but the face was such an evidence
against it if it were so she is lost for ever

Mask And so is Beatrix

Wild Now could I cut my throat for madness

Mask Now could I break my neck for despair if I could find a
precipice absolutely to my liking

Wild Tis in vain to consider ont Theres but one way go you
Maskall and find her out and invent some excuse for me and be sure to
beg leave I may come and wait upon her with the gold before she sleeps

Mask In the mean time youll be thinking at your lodging

Wild But make haste then to relieve me for I think over all my
thoughts in half an hour
                                                           Exit MASK

Wild Solus Hang it now I think ont I shall be but melancholic
at my lodging Ill go pass my hour at the gaminghouse and make use of
this money while I have tools to win more to it Stay let me seeI
have the box and throw My Don he sets me ten pistoles I nick him Ten
more I sweep them too Now in all reason he is nettled and sets me
twenty I win them too Now he kindles and butters me with forty They
are all my own In fine he is vehement and bleeds on to fourscore or
an hundred and I not willing to tempt fortune come away a moderate
winner of two hundred pistoles


SCENE II

The SCENE opens and discovers AURELIA and CAMILLA Behind them a
table and lights set on it The Scene is a Garden with an arbour in it

The gardendoor opens How now Aurelia and Camilla in expectation of
Don Melchor at the garden door Ill away least I prevent the design
and within this half hour come sailing back with full pockets as
wantonly as a laden galleon from the Indies
                                                                Exit

Aur But dost thou think the Englishman can keep his promise For I
confess I furiously desire to see the idea of Don Melchor

Cam But madam if you should see him it will not be he but the
devil in his likeness and then why should you desire it

Aur In effect tis a very dark enigma and one must be very spiritual
to understand it But be what it will body or phantom I am resolved to
meet it

Cam Can you do it without fear

Aur No I must avow it I am furiously fearful but yet I am resolved
to sacrifice all things to my love Therefore let us pass over that
chapter
                                              Don MELCHOR without

Cam Do you hear madam theres one treading already how if it be
he

Aur If it be he that is to say his spectre that is to say his
phantom that is to say his idea that is to say he and not he

Cam Crying out Ah madam tis he himself but hes as big again
as he used to be with eyes like saucers Ill save myself
                                                Runs under the table

Enter Don MELCHOR They both shriek

Aur Oh heaven humanity is not able to support it
                                                             Running

Mel Dear Aurelia what mean you

Aur The tempter has imitated his voice too avoid avoid spectre

Cam If he should find me under the table now

Mel Is it thus my dear that you treat your servant

Aur I am not thy dear I renounce thee spirit of darkness

Mel This spirit of darkness is come to see an angel of light by her
command and to assure her of his constancy that he will be hers
eternally

Aur Away infernal tis not thee tis the true Don Melchor that I
would see

Mel Hell and furies

Aur Heaven and angels Ah
                                                 Runs out shrieking

Mel This is a riddle past my finding out to send for me and then to
shun me but heres one shall resolve it for me Camilla what dost thou
there

Cam Help help I shall be carried away bodily
          She rises up overthrows the table and lights and runs out
                                                      The scene shuts

Mel Alone Why Aurelia Camilla they are both run out of
hearing this amazes me what can the meaning of it be Sure she has
heard of my unfaithfulness and was resolved to punish me by this
contrivance to put an affront upon me by this abrupt departure as I
did on her by my seeming absence

Enter THEODOSIA and BEATRIX

Theo Don Melchor is it you my love that have frighted Aurelia so
terribly

Mel Alas madam I know not but coming hither by your appointment
and thinking myself secure in the night without disguise perhaps it
might work upon her fancy because she thought me absent

Theo Since tis so unluckily fallen out that she knows you are at
Madrid it can no longer be kept a secret therefore you must now
pretend openly to me and run the risk of a denial from my father

Mel O madam theres no question but hell refuse me For alas
what is it he can see in me worthy of that honour Or if he should be
so partial to me as some in the world are to think me valiant
learned and not altogether a fool yet my want of fortune would weigh
down all

Theo When he has refused you his consent I may
with justice dispose of myself and that while you are constant shall
never be to any but yourself In witness of which accept this diamond
as a pledge of my hearts firmness to you

Beat Madam your father is coming this way

Theo Tis no matter do not stir since he must know you are
returned let him now see you

Enter Don ALONZO

Alon Daughter what make you here at this unseasonable hour

Theo Sir

Alon I know what you would say that you heard a noise and ran
hither to see what it might beBless us who is this with you

Mel Tis your servant Don Melchor just returned from St Sebastians

Alon But sir I thought you had been upon the sea for Flanders

Mel I had so designed it

Alon But why came you back from St Sebastians

Mel As for that sir tis not material

Theo An unexpected lawsuit has called him back from St Sebastians

Alon And how fares my soninlaw that lives there

Mel In Catholic health sir

Alon Have you brought no letters from him

Mel I had sir but I was set upon by the way by picarons and in
spite of my resistance robbed and my portmanteau taken from me

Theo And this was that which he was now desiring me to excuse to
you

Alon If my credit friends or counsel can do you any service in
your suit I hope you will command them freely

Mel When I have dispatched some private business I shall not fail to
trouble you till then humbly kisses your hands the most obliged of
your servants
                                                        Exit MELCHOR

Alon Daughter now this cavalier is gone what occasion brought you
out so lateI know what you would say that it is melancholy a
tincture of the hypochondria you mean But what cause have you for this
melancholy Give me your hand and answer me without ambages or
ambiguities

Theo He will find out I have given away my ringI must prevent
himSir I am ashamed to confess it to you but in hope of your
indulgence I have lost the table diamond you gave me

Alon You would say The fear of my displeasure has caused the
perturbation in you well do not disquiet yourself too much you say
tis gone I say so too Tis stolen and that by some thief I take it
But I will go and consult the astrologer immediately
                                                         He is going

Theo What have I done To avoid one inconvenience I have run into
another This devil of an astrologer will discover that Don Melchor has
it
                                                               Aside

Alon When did you lose this diamond The minute and second I should
know but the hour will serve for the degree ascending

Theo Sir the precise time I know not but it was betwixt six and
seven in the evening as near as I can guess

Alon Tis enough by all the stars Ill have it for you Therefore
go in and suppose it on your finger

Beat Ill watch you at a distance sir that my Englishman may have
wherewithal to answer you
                                            Aside Exeunt THEO BEAT

Alon This melancholy wherewith my daughter laboureth isaI know
what I would say is a certain species of the hysterical disease or a
certain motion caused by a certain appetite which at a certain time
heaveth in her like a certain motion of an earthquake

Enter BELLAMY

Bel This is the place and very near the time that Theodosia appoints
her meeting with Don Melchor He is this night otherwise disposed of
with Aurelia Tis but trying my fortune to tell her of his infidelity
and my love If she yields she makes me happy if not I shall be sure
Don Melchor has not planted the arms of Spain in the fort before me
However Ill push my fortune as sure as I am an Englishman

Alon Sennor Inglis I know your voice though I cannot perfectly
discern you

Bel How the devil came he to cross me

Alon I was just coming to have asked another favour of you

Bel Without ceremony command me sir

Alon My daughter Theodosia has lost a fair diamond from her finger
the time betwixt six and seven this evening now I desire you sir to
erect a scheme for it and if it be lost or stolen to restore it to
me This is all sir

Bel There is no end of this old fellow thus will he bait me from day
to day till my ignorance be found out
                                                               Aside

Alon Now is he casting a figure by the art of memory and making a
judgment of it to himself This astrology is a very mysterious
speculation
                                                               Aside

Bel Tis a madness for me to hope I can deceive him longer Since
then he must know I am no astrologer Ill discover it myself to him
and blush once for all
                                                               Aside

Alon Well sir and what do the stars hold forth What says nimble
master Mercury to the matter

Bel Sir not to keep you longer in ignorance I must ingenuously
declare to you that I am not the man for whom you take me Some
smattering in astrology I have which my friends by their indiscretion
have blown abroad beyond my intentions But you are not a person to be
imposed on like the vulgar Therefore to satisfy you in one word my
skill goes not far enough to give you knowledge of what you desire from
me

Alon You have said enough sir to persuade me of your science if
fame had not published it yet this very humility of yours were enough
to confirm me in the belief of it

Bel Death you make me mad sir Will you have me swear As I am a
gentleman a man of the town one who wears good cloaths eats drinks
and wenches abundantly I am a damned ignorant and senseless fellow

Enter BEATRIX

Alon How now gentlewomanWhat are you going to relief by
moonshine

Beat I was going on a very charitable office to help a friend that
was gravelled in a very doubtful business

Bel Some good news fortune I beseech thee

Beat But now I have found this learned gentleman I shall make bold
to propound a question to him from a lady

Alon I will have my own question first resolved

Bel O sir tis from a lady

Beat If you please sir Ill tell it in your earMy lady has given
Don Melchor the ring in whose company her father found her just now at
the gardendoor
                                                        In a whisper

Bel Aloud Come to me tomorrow and you shall receive an answer

Beat Your servant sir
                                                        Exit BEATRIX

Alon Sir I shall take it very unkindly if you satisfy any other and
leave me in this perplexity

Bel Sir if my knowledge were according

Alon No more of that sir I beseech you

Bel Perhaps I may know something by my art concerning it but for
your quiet I wish you would not press me

Alon Do you think I am not master of my passions

Bel Since you will needs know what I would willingly have concealed
the person who has your diamond is he whom you saw last in your
daughters company

Alon You would say tis Don Melchor de Guzman Who the devil would
have suspected him of such an action But he is of a decayed family and
poverty it seems has enforced him to it Now I think ont better he
has een stolen it for a fee to bribe his lawyer to requite a lie with
a theft Ill seek him out and tell him part of my mind before I sleep
                                                           Exit ALON

Bel So once more I am at liberty But this astrology is so
troublesome a scienceWould I were well rid ont

Enter Don LOPEZ and a Servant

Lop Astrology does he say O cavalier is it you not finding you
at home I came on purpose to seek you out I have a small request to
the stars by your mediation

Bel Sir for pity let them shine in quiet a little for what for
ladies and their servants and younger brothers they scarce get a
holiday in a twelvemonth

Lop Pray pardon me if I am a little curious of my destiny since
all my happiness depends on your answer

Bel Well sir what is it you expect

Lop To know whether my love to a lady will be successful

Bel Tis Aurelia he means AsideSir in one word I answer
you that your mistress loves another one who is your friend But
comfort yourself the dragons tail is between him and home he never
shall enjoy her

Lop But what hope for me

Bel The stars have partly assured me you shall be happy if you
acquaint her with your passion and with the doubledealing of your
friend who is false to her

Lop You speak like an oracle But I have engaged my promise to that
friend to serve him in his passion to my mistress

Bel We English seldom make such scruples women are not comprised in
our laws of friendship They are fer natur our common game like
hare and partridge Every man has equal right to them as he has to the
sun and elements

Lop Must I then betray my friend

Bel In that case my friend is a Turk to me if he will be so
barbarous as to retain two women to his private use I will be factious
for all distressed damsels who would much rather have their cause tried
by a full jury than a single judge

Lop Well sir I will take your counsel and if I err the fault be
on love and you
                                                            Exit LOP

Bel Were it not for love I would run out of the town thats the
short ont for I have engaged myself in so many promises for the sun
and moon and those little mincedmeats of them that I must hide before
my day of payment comes In the mean time I forget Theodosia but now I
defy the devil to hinder me

As he is going out he meets AURELIA and almost justles her down
With her CAMILLA enters

Aur What rudeness is this

Bel Madam Aurelia is it you

Aur Monsieur Bellamy

Bel The same madam

Aur My uncle told me he left you here And indeed I came hither to
complain of you For you have treated me so inhumanly that I have some
reason to resent it

Bel What occasion can I have given you for a complaint

Aur Don Melchor as I am informed by my uncle is effectively at
Madrid So that it was not his idea but himself in person whom I saw
And since you knew this why did you conceal it from me

Bel When I spoke with you I knew it not But I discovered it in the
erecting of my figure Yet if instead of his idea I constrained
himself to come in spite of his resolution to remain concealed I think
I have shown a greater effect of my art than what I promised

Aur I render myself to so convincing an argument But by overhearing
a discourse just now betwixt my cousin Theodosia and her maid I find
that he has concealed himself upon her account which has given me
jealousy to the last point for to avow an incontestible truth my
cousin is furiously handsome

Bel Madam madam trust not your ears too far she talked on purpose
that you might hear her But I assure you the true cause of Don
Melchors concealment was not love of her but jealousy of you He staid
in private to observe your actions Build upont madam he is
inviolably yours

Aur Then will he sacrifice my cousin to me

Bel Tis furiously true madam

Aur O most agreeable assurance

Cam Albricias madam for my good news Don Melchor is coming this
way I know him by his voice but he is in company with another person

Aur It will not be convenient to give him any umbrage by seeing me
with another person therefore I will go before do you stay here and
conduct him to my apartment Goodnight sir
                                                                Exit

Bel I have promised Don Lopez he shall possess her and I have
promised her she shall possess Don Melchor Tis a little difficult I
confess as to the matrimonial part of it But if Don Melchor will be
civil to her and she be civil to Don Lopez my credit is safe without
the benefit of my clergy But all this is nothing to Theodosia
                                                            Exit BEL

Enter Don ALONZO and Don MELCHOR

Cam Don Melchor a word in private

Mel Your pleasure ladySir I will wait on you immediately

Cam I am sent to you from a fair lady who bears you no ill will You
may guess whom I mean

Mel Not by my own merits but by knowing whom you serve But I
confess I wonder at her late strange usage when she fled from me

Cam That was only a mistake but I have now by her command been in
a thousand places in quest of you

Mel You overjoy me

Cam And where amongst the rest do you think I have been looking
you

Mel Pray refresh my memory

Cam In that same street by the same shopyou know where by a good
token

Mel By what token

Cam Just by that shop where out of your nobleness you promised me
a new silk gown

Mel O now I understand you

Cam Not that I press you to a performance

Mel Take this and please yourself in the choice of it
                                                     Gives her money

Cam Nay dear sir now you make me blush in faith Iam ashamedI
swear tis only because I would keep something for your sakebut my
lady expects you immediately in her apartment

Mel Ill wait on her if I can possibly Exit CAM But if I can
prevail with Don Alonzo for his daughter then will I again consider
which of the ladies best deserves me Aside Sir I beg your pardon
for this rudeness in leaving you
                                                             To ALON

Alon I cannot possibly resolve with myself to tell him openly he is a
thief but Ill gild the pill for him to swallow
                                                               Aside

Mel I believe he has discovered our amour How he surveys me for a
soninlaw
                                                               Aside

Alon Sir I am sorry for your sake that true nobility is not always
accompanied with riches to support it in its lustre

Mel You have a just exception against the capriciousness of destiny
yet if I were owner of any noble qualities which I am not I should
not much esteem the goods of fortune

Alon But pray conceive me sir your father did not leave you
flourishing in wealth

Mel Only a very fair seat in Andalusia with all the pleasures
imaginable about it That alone were my poor deserts accordingwhich
I confess they are notwere enough to make a woman happy in it

Alon But give me leave to come to the point I beseech you sir I
have lost a jewel which I value infinitely and I hear it is in your
possession But I accuse your wants not you for it

Mel Your daughter is indeed a jewel but she were not lost were she
in possession of a man of parts

Alon A precious diamond sir

Mel But a man of honour sir

Alon I know what you would say sirthat a man of honour is not
capable of an unworthy action and therefore I do not accuse you of
the theft I suppose the jewel was only put into your hands

Mel By honourable ways I assure you sir

Alon Sir sir will you restore my jewel

Mel Will you please sir to give me leave to be the unworthy
possessor of her I know how to use her with that respect

Alon I know what you would say sir but if it belong to our family
otherwise I assure you it were at your service

Mel As it belongs to your family I covet it not that I plead my own
deserts sir

Alon Sir I know your deserts but I protest I cannot part with it
For I must tell you this diamond ring was originally my
greatgrandfathers

Mel A diamond ring sir do you mean

Alon By your patience sir when I have done you may speak your
pleasure I only lent it to my daughter but how she lost it and how
it came upon your finger I am yet in tenebris

Mel Sir

Alon I know it sir but spare yourself the trouble Ill speak for
you you would say you had it from some other hand I believe it sir

Mel But sir

Alon I warrant you sir Ill bring you off without your
speakingfrom another hand you had it and now sir as you say sir
and as I am saying for you sir you are loth to part with it

Mel Good sirlet me

Alon I understand you already sirthat you have taken a fancy to
it and would buy it but to that I answer as I did before that it is
a relick of my family Now sir if you can urge aught farther you have
liberty to speak without interruption

Mel This diamond you speak of I confess

Alon But what need you confess sir before you are accused

Mel You promised you would hear me in my turn sir but

Alon But as you were saying it is needless because I have already
spoken for you

Mel The truth is sir I was too presumptuous to take this pledge
from Theodosia without your knowledge but you will pardon the
invincible necessity when I tell you

Alon You need not tell me I know your necessity was the reason of
it and that place and opportunity have caused your error

Mel This is the goodest old man I ever knew he prevents me in my
motion for his daughter
                                                               Aside
Since sir you know the cause of my errors and are pleased to lay part
of the blame upon youth and opportunity I beseech you favour me so far
to accept me as fair Theodosia already has

Alon I conceive you sirthat I would accept of your excuse Why
restore the diamond and tis done

Mel More joyfully than I received it And with it I beg the honour
to be received by you as your soninlaw

Alon My soninlaw this is the most pleasant proposition I ever
heard

Mel I am proud you think it so but I protest I think not I deserve
this honour

Alon Nor I I assure you sir marry my daughterha ha ha

Mel But sir

Alon I know what you would say sirthat there is too much hazard in
the profession of a thief and therefore you would marry my daughter to
become rich without venturing your neck fort I beseech you sir
steal on be apprehended and if you please be hanged it shall make
no breach betwixt us For my part Ill keep your counsel and so good
night sir
                                                           Exit ALON

Mel Is the devil in this old man first to give me occasion to
confess my love and when he knew it to promise he would keep my
counsel But who are these Ill not be seen but to my old appointment
with Theodosia and desire her to unriddle it
                                                            Exit MEL


SCENE III

Enter MASKALL JACINTHA and BEATRIX

Mask But madam do you take me for a man of honour

Jac No

Mask Why theres it if you had I would have sworn that my master
has neither done nor intended you any injury I suppose youll grant he
knew you in your disguise

Beat Nay to know her and use her so is an aggravation of his
crime

Mask Unconscionable Beatrix would you two have all the carnival to
yourselves He knew you madam and was resolved to countermine you in
all your plots But when he saw you so much piqued he was too good
natured to let you sleep in wrath and sent me to you to disabuse you
for if the business had gone on till tomorrow when Lent begins you
would have grown so peevish as all good Catholics are with fasting
that the quarrel would never have been ended

Jac Well this mollifies a little I am content he shall see me

Mask But that you may be sure he knew you he will bring the
certificate of the purse along with him

Jac I shall be glad to find him innocent

Enter WILDBLOOD at the other end of the stage

Wild No mortal man ever threw out so often It could not be me it
must be the devil that did it He took all the chances and changed them
after I had thrown them But Ill be even with him for Ill never
throw one of his dice more

Mask Madam tis certainly my master and he is so zealous to make
his peace that he could not stay till I called him to youSir

Wild Sirrah Ill teach you more manners than to leave me another
time You rogue you have lost me two hundred pistoles you and the
devil your accomplice you by leaving me to myself and he by tempting
me to play it off

Mask Is the wind in that door Heres like to be fine doings

Wild O mischief am I fallen into her ambush I must face it out with
another quarrel
                                                               Aside

Jac Your man has been treating your accommodation tis half made
already

Wild Ay on your part it may be

Jac He says you knew me

Wild Yes I do know you so well that my poor heart aches fort I
was going to bed without telling you my mind but upon consideration I
am come

Jac To bring the money with you

Wild To declare my grievances which are great and many

Mask Well for impudence let thee alone

Wild As in the first place

Jac Ill hear no grievances wheres the money

Beat Ay keep to that madam

Wild Do you think me a person to be so used

Jac We will not quarrel wheres the money

Wild By your favour we will quarrel

Beat Money money

Wild I am angry and can hear nothing

Beat Money money money money

Wild Do you think it a reasonable thing to put on two disguises in a
night to tempt a man Help me Maskall for I want arguments
abominably I thank heaven I was never so barbarously used in all my
life

Jac He begins to anger me in good earnest

Mask A thing so much against the rules of modesty So indecent a
thing

Wild Ay so indecent a thing Nay now I do not wonder at myself for
being angry And then to wonder I should love her in those disguises To
quarrel at the natural desires of human kind assaulted by powerful
temptations I am enraged at that

Jac Heyday you had best quarrel too for my bringing you the money

Wild I have a grudging to you fort Maskall the money Maskall
now help or we are gone

Mask Would she offer to bring money to you first to affront your
poverty

Wild Ay to affront my poverty But thats no great matter and
then

Mask And then to bring you money sir I stick fast sir

Wild Forward you dog and invent or Ill cut your throat And
then as I was saying to bring me money

Mask Which is the greatest and most sweet of all temptations and to
think you could resist it Being also aggravated by her handsomeness
who brought it

Wild Resist it No I would she would understand it I know better
what belongs to flesh and blood than so

Beat to Jac This is plain confederacy I smoke it he came on
purpose to quarrel with you break first with him and prevent it

Jac If it be come to that once the devil take the hindmost Ill not
be last in love for that will be a dishonour to my sex

Wild And then

Jac Hold sir there needs no more you shall fall out and Ill
gratify you with a new occasion I only tried you in hope you would be
false and rather than fail of my design brought gold to bribe you
tot

Beat As people when they have an ill bargain are content to lose by
it that they may get it off their hands

Mask Beatrix while our principals are engaged I hold it not for our
honour to stand idle

Beat With all my heart Please you let us draw off to some other
ground

Mask I dare meet you on any spot but one

Wild I think we shall do well to put it to an issue this is the last
time you shall ever be troubled with my addresses

Jac The favour had been greater to have spared this too

Mask Beatrix let us dispatch or theyll break off before us

Beat Break as fast as thou wilt I am as brittle as thou art for thy
heart

Wild Because I will absolutely break off with you I will keep
nothing that belongs to you therefore take back your picture and your
handkerchief

Jac I have nothing of yours to keep therefore take back your liberal
promises Take them in imagination

Wild Not to be behindhand with you in your frumps I give you back
your purse of gold Take you thatin imagination

Jac To conclude with you take back your oaths and protestations
they are never the worse for the wearing I assure you Therefore take
them spick and span new for the use of your next mistress

Mask Beatrix follow your leader heres the sixpenny whittle you
gave me with the mutton haft I can spare it for knives are of little
use in Spain

Beat Theres your scissars with the stinking brass chain to them
Tis well there was no love betwixt us for they had been too dull to
cut it

Mask Theres the dandriff comb you lent me

Beat Theres your ferretribbanding for garters

Mask I would never have come so near as to have taken them from you

Beat For your letter I have it not about me but upon reputation
Ill burn it

Mask And for yours I have already put it to a fitting
employmentCourage sir how goes the battle on your wing

Wild Just drawing off on both sides Adieu Spain

Jac Farewell old England

Beat Come away in triumph the days your own madam

Mask Ill bear you off upon my shoulders sir we have broke their
hearts

Wild Let her go first then Ill stay and keep the honour of the
field

Jac Ill not retreat if you stay till midnight

Wild Are you sure then we have done loving

Jac Yes very sure I think so

Wild Tis well you are so for otherwise I feel my stomach a little
maukish I should have doubted another fit of love were coming up

Jac No no your inconstancy secures you enough for that

Wild Thats it which makes me fear my own returning Nothing vexes
me but that you should part with me so slightly as though I were not
worth your keeping Well tis a sign you never loved me

Jac Tis the least of your care whether I did or did not It may be
it had been more for the quiet of myself if Ibut tis no matter
Ill not give you that satisfaction

Wild But whats the reason you will not give it me

Jac For the reason that we are quite broke off

Wild Why are we quite quite broke off

Jac Why are we not

Wild Well since tis past tis past but a pox of all foolish
quarrelling for my part

Jac And a mischief of all foolish disguisements for my part

Wild But if it were to do again with another mistress I would even
plainly confess I had lost my money

Jac And if I had to deal with another servant I would learn more wit
than to tempt him in disguises for thats to throw a Veniceglass to
the ground to try if it would not break

Wild If it were not to please you I see no necessity of our parting

Jac I protest I do it only out of complaisance to you

Wild But if I should play the fool and ask your pardon you would
refuse it

Jac No never submit for I should spoil you again with pardoning
you

Mask Do you hear this Beatrix They are just upon the point of
accommodation we must make haste or theyll make a peace by
themselves and exclude us from the treaty

Beat Declare yourself the aggressor then and Ill take you into
mercy

Wild The worst that you can say of me is that I have loved you
thrice over

Jac The prime articles between Spain and England are sealed for the
rest concerning a more strict alliance if you please well dispute
them in the garden

Wild But in the first place let us agree on the article of
navigation I beseech you

Beat These leagues offensive and defensive will be too strict for
us Maskall A treaty of commerce will serve our turn

Mask With all my heart and when our loves are veering Well make no
words but fall to privateering
                                   Exeunt the men leading the women




ACT V SCENE I


Enter LOPEZ AURELIA and CAMILLA

Lop Tis true if he had continued constant to you I should have
thought myself obliged in honour to be his friend but I could no longer
suffer him to abuse a person of your worth and beauty with a feigned
affection

Aur But is it possible Don Melchor should be false to love Ill be
sworn I did not imagine such a treachery could have been in nature
especially to a lady who had so obliged him

Lop Twas this madam which gave me the confidence to wait upon you
at an hour which would be otherwise unseasonable

Aur You are the most obliging person in the world

Lop But to clear it to you that he is false he is at this very
minute at an assignation with your cousin in the garden I am sure he
was endeavouring it not an hour ago

Aur I swear this evenings air begins to incommode me extremely with
a cold but yet in hope of detecting this perjured man I am content
to stay abroad

Lop But withal you must permit me to tell you madam that it is but
just I should have some share in a heart which I endeavour to redeem
In the law of arms you know that they who pay the ransom have right
to dispose of the prisoner

Aur The prize is so very inconsiderable that tis not worth the
claiming

Lop If I thought the boon were small I would not importune my
princess with the asking it But since my life depends upon the grant

Cam Maam I must needs tell your laship that Don Lopez has
deserved you for he has acted all along like a cavalier and more for
your interest than his own Besides maam Don Melchor is as poor as he
is false For my part I shall never endure to call him master

Aur Don Lopez go along with me I can promise nothing but I swear I
will do my best to disengage my heart from this furious tender which I
have for him

Cam If I had been a man I could never have forsaken you Ah those
languishing casts maam and that pouting lip of your laship like a
cherrybough weighed down with the weight of fruit

Aur And that sigh too I think is not altogether disagreeable but
something charmante and mignonne

Cam Well Don Lopez youll be but too happy

Lop If I were once possessor

Enter BELLAMY and THEODOSIA

Theo O we are surprised

Bel Fear nothing madam I think I know them Don Lopez

Lop Our famous astrologer how come you here

Bel I am infinitely happy to have met you with Donna Aurelia that
you may do me the favour to satisfy this lady of a truth which I can
scarce persuade her to believe

Lop I am glad our concernments are so equal for I have the like
favour to ask from Donna Theodosia

Theo Don Lopez is too noble to be refused any thing within my power
and I am ready to do him any service after I have asked my cousin if
ever Don Melchor pretended to her

Aur Tis the very question which I was furiously resolved to have
asked of you

Theo I must confess he has made some professions to me And withal I
will acknowledge my own weakness so far as to tell you I have given way
he should often visit me when the world believed him absent

Aur O cavalier astrologer how have you betrayed me did you not
assure me that Don Melchors tender and inclination was for me only

Bel I had it from his star madam I do assure you and if that
twinkled false I cannot help it The truth is theres no trusting the
planet of an inconstant man he was moving to you when I looked on it
and if since it has changed the course I am not to be blamed for it

Lop Now madam the truth is evident And for this cavalier he might
easily be deceived in Melchor for I dare affirm it to you both he
never knew to which of you he was most inclined For he visited one and
writ letters to the other

Bel to Theo Then madam I must claim your promise since I have
discovered to you that Don Melchor is unworthy of your favours that you
would make me happy who amongst my many imperfections can never be
guilty of such a falsehood

Theo If I have been deceived in Melchor whom I have known so long
you cannot reasonably expect I should trust you at a days
acquaintance

Bel For that madam you may know as much of me in a day as you can
in all your life All my humours circulate like my blood at farthest
within twentyfour hours I am plain and true like all my countrymen
you see to the bottom of me as easily as you do to the gravel of a
clear stream in autumn

Lop You plead so well sir that I desire you would speak for me too
My cause is the same with yours only it has not so good an advocate

Aur Since I cannot make myself happy I will have the glory to
felicitate another and therefore I declare I will reward the
fidelity of Don Lopez

Theo All that I can say at present is that I will never be Don
Melchors The rest time and your service must make out

Bel I have all I can expect to be admitted as eldest servant as
preferment falls I hope you will remember my seniority

Cam Maam Don Melchor

Aur Cavaliers retire a little we shall see to which of us he will
make his court
                                                    The men withdraw

Enter DON MELCHOR

Don Melchor I thought you had been abed before this time

Mel Fair Aurelia this is a blessing beyond expectation to see you
again so soon

Aur What important business brought you hither

Mel Only to make my peace with you before I slept You know you are
the saint to whom I pay my devotions

Aur And yet it was beyond your expectances to meet me This is
furiously incongruous

Theo advancing Don Melchor whither were you bound so late

Mel What shall I say I am so confounded that I know not to which of
them I should excuse myself
                                                               Aside

Theo Pray answer me truly to one question Did you ever make any
addresses to my cousin

Mel Fie fie madam theres a question indeed

Aur How monster of ingratitude can you deny the declaration of your
passion to me

Mel I say nothing madam

Theo Which of us is it for whom you are concerned

Mel For that madam you must excuse me I have more discretion than
to boast a ladys favour

Aur Did you counterfeit an address to me

Mel Still I say nothing madam but I will satisfy either of you in
private for these matters are too tender for public discourse

Enter LOPEZ and BELLAMY hastily with their swords drawn

Bellamy and Lopez This is strange

Lop Ladies we would not have disturbed you but as we were walking
to the garden door it opened suddenly against us and we confusedly
saw by moonlight some persons entering but who they were we know not

Bel You had best retire into the gardenhouse and leave us to take
our fortunes without prejudice to your reputations

Enter WILDBLOOD MASKALL JACINTHA and BEATRIX

Wild To Jacintha entering Do not fear madam I think I heard my
friends voice

Bel Marry hang you is it you that have given us this hot alarm

Wild Theres more in it than you imagine the whole house is up For
seeing you two and not knowing you after I had entered the
gardendoor I made too much haste to get out again and have left the
key broken in it With the noise one of the servants came running in
whom I forced back and doubtless he is gone for company for you may
see lights running through every chamber

Theo Jac What will become of us

Bel We must have recourse to our former resolution Let the ladies
retire into the gardenhouse And now I think on it you gentlemen
shall go in with them and leave me and Maskall to bear the brunt of it

Mask Me sir I beseech you let me go in with the ladies too dear
Beatrix speak a good word for me I protest tis more out of love to
thy company than for any fear I have

Bel You dog I have need of your wit and counsel We have no time to
deliberate Will you stay sir
                                                          To MASKALL

Mask No sir tis not for my safety

Bel Will you in sir
                                                          To MELCHOR

Mel No sir tis not for my honour to be assisting to you Ill to
Don Alonzo and help to revenge the injury you are doing him

Bel Then we are lost I can do nothing

Wild Nay an you talk of honour by your leave sir I hate your
Spanish honour ever since it spoiled our English plays with faces
about and tother side
                                  Falls upon him and throws him down

Mel What do you mean you will not murder me Must valour be
oppressed by multitudes

Wild Come yarely my mates every man to his share of the burden
Come yarely hay
                   The four men take him each by a limb and carry him
                                                 out he crying murder

Theo If this Englishman save us now I shall admire his wit

Beat Good wits never think themselves admired till they are well
rewarded You must pay him in specie madam give him love for his wit

Enter the Men again

Bel Ladies fear nothing but enter into the gardenhouse
with these cavaliers

Mask O that I were a cavalier too
                                                  Is going with them

Bel Come you back sirrah Stops him Think yourselves as safe as
in a sanctuary only keep quiet whatever happens

Jac Come away then they are upon us
                                      Exeunt all but BEL and MASK

Mask Hark I hear the foe coming Methinks they threaten too sir
pray let me go in for a guard to the ladies and poor Beatrix I can
fight much better when there is a wall betwixt me and danger

Bel Peace I have occasion for your wit to help me to lie

Mask Sir upon the faith of a sinner you have had my last lie
already I have not one more to do me credit as I hope to be saved
sir

Bel Victoire victoire knock under you rogue and confess me
conqueror and you shall see Ill bring all off

Enter DON ALONZO and six Servants with lights and swords drawn

Alon Search about there

Bel Fear nothing do but vouch what I shall say

Mask For a passive lie I can yet do something

Alon Stand who goes there

Bel Friends

Alon Friends Who are you

Bel Noble Don Alonzo such as are watching for your good

Alon Is it you Sennor Inglis Why all this noise and tumult Where
are my daughters and my niece But in the first place though last
named how came you hither sir

Bel I came hitherby astrology sir

Mask My masters in heavens send him good shipping with his lie and
all kind devils stand his friends

Alon How by astrology sir Meaning you came hither by art magic

Bel I say by pure astrology sir I foresaw by my art a little after
I had left you that your niece and daughters would this night run a
risque of being carried away from this very garden

Alon O the wonders of this speculation

Bel Thereupon I called immediately for my sword and came in all
haste to advertise you but I see theres no resisting destiny for just
as I was entering the garden door I met the women with their gallants
all under sail and outward bound

Mask Thereupon what does me he but draws by my advice

Bel How now Mr Rascal Are you itching to be in
                                                               Aside

Mask Pray sir let me go snip with you in this lie and be not too
covetous of honour You know I never stood with you now my courage is
come to me I cannot resist the temptation
                                                               Aside

Bel Content tell on

Mask So in short sir we drew first I and then my master but
being overpowered they have escaped us so that I think you may go to
bed and trouble yourself no further for gone they are

Bel You tell a lie you have curtailed my invention You are not fit
to invent a lie for a bawd when she would wheedle a young squire
                                                               Aside

Alon Call up the officers of justice Ill have the town searched
immediately

Bel Tis in vain sir I know by my art youll
never recover them Besides tis an affront to my friends the stars
who have otherwise disposed of them

Enter a Servant

Ser Sir the key is broken in the gardendoor and the door locked
so that of necessity they must be in the garden yet

Alon Disperse yourselves some into the wilderness some into the
alleys and some into the parterre You Diego go try to get out the
key and run to the corrigidor for his assistance In the mean time
Ill search the gardenhouse myself
                                     Exeunt all the servants but one

Mask Ill be unbetted again if you please sir and leave you all
the honour of it
                                                  To BELLAMY aside

Alon Come cavalier let us in together

Bel holding him Hold sir for the love of heaven you are not
mad

Alon We must leave no place unsearched A light there

Bel Hold I say do you know what you are undertaking And have you
armed yourself with resolution for such an adventure

Alon What adventure

Bel A word in privateThe place you would go into is full of
enchantments there are at this time for aught I know a legion of
spirits in it

Alon You confound me with wonder sir

Bel I have been making there my magical operations to know the event
of your daughters flight and to perform it rightly have been forced
to call up spirits of several orders And there they are humming like a
swarm of bees some stalking about upon the ground some flying and
some sticking upon the walls like rearmice

Mask The devils in him hes got off again

Alon Now sir I shall try the truth of your friendship to me To
confess the secret of my soul to you I have all my life been curious to
see a devil and to that purpose have conned Agrippa through and
through and made experiment of all his rules Pari die et incremento
Lun and yet could never compass the sight of one of these
dmoniums If you will ever oblige me let it be on this occasion

Mask Theres another storm arising

Bel You shall pardon me sir Ill not expose you to that peril for
the world without due preparations of ceremony

Alon For that sir I always carry a talisman about me that will
secure me And therefore I will venture in a Gods name and defy them
all at once
                                                            Going in

Mask How the pox will he get off from this

Bel Well sir since you are so resolved send off your servant that
there may be no noise made ont and well take our venture

Alon Pedro leave your light and help the fellows to search the
garden
                                                        Exit Servant

Mask What does my incomprehensible master mean

Bel Now I must tell you sir you will see that which will very
much astonish you if my art fail me not Goes to the door You
spirits and intelligences that are within there stand close and
silent at your peril and fear nothing but appear in your own shapes
boldlyMaskall open the door

    MASKALL goes to one side of the scene which draws and discovers
     THEO JAC AUR BEAT CAM LOP WILD standing all without motion
     in a rank

Now sir what think you

Alon They are here they are here We need search no farther Ah you
ungracious baggages
                                                   Going toward them

Bel Stay or youll be torn in pieces These are the very shapes I
conjured up and truly represent to you in what company your niece and
daughters are this very moment

Alon Why are they not they I durst have sworn that some of them had
been my own flesh and bloodLook one of them is just like that rogue
your comrade
                            WILD shakes his head and frowns at him

Bel Do you see how you have provoked that English devil Take heed of
him if he gets you once into his clutches
                                                 WILD embracing JAC

Alon He seems to have got possession of the spirit of my Jacintha by
his hugging her

Bel Nay I imagined as much Do but look upon his physiognomyyou
have read Baptista Porta Has he not the leer of a very lewd debauched
spirit

Alon He has indeed Then theres my niece Aurelia with the spirit of
Don Lopez but thats well enough and my daughter Theodosia all alone
Pray how comes that about

Bel Shes provided for with a familiar too One that is in this very
room with you and by your elbow but Ill shew you him some other time

Alon And that baggage Beatrix how I would swinge her if I had her
here Ill lay my life she was in the plot for the flight of her
mistresses
                                        BEAT claps her hands at him

Bel Sir you do ill to provoke her for being the spirit of a woman
she is naturally mischievous You see she can scarce hold her hands from
you already

Mask Let me alone to revenge your quarrel upon Beatrix If eer she
come to light Ill take a course with her I warrant you sir

Bel Now come away sir you have seen enough the spirits are in pain
whilst we are here We keep them too long condensed in bodies if we
were gone they would rarify into air immediatelyMaskall shut the
door
                              MASK goes to the scene and it closes

Alon Monstrum hominis O prodigy of science

Enter two Servants with Don MELCHOR

Bel Now help me with a lie Maskall or we are lost

Mask Sir I could never lie with man or woman in a fright

Serv Sir we found this gentleman bound and gagged and he desired us
to bring him to you with all haste imaginable

Mel O sir sir your two daughters and your niece

Bel They are gone he knows itBut are you mad sir to set this
pernicious wretch at liberty

Mel I endeavoured all that I was able

Mask Now sir I have it for you Aside to his masterHe was
endeavouring indeed to have got away with them for your daughter
Theodosia was his prize But we prevented him and left him in the
condition in which you see him

Alon I thought somewhat was the matter that Theodosia had not a
spirit by her as her sister had

Bel This was he I meant to shew you

Mel Do you believe him sir

Bel No no believe him sir You know his truth ever since he stole
your daughters diamond

Mel I swear to you by my honour

Alon Nay a thief I knew him and yet after that he had the
impudence to ask me for my daughter

Bel Was he so impudent The case is plain sir put him quickly into
custody

Mel Hear me but one word sir and Ill discover all to you

Bel Hear him not sir for my art assures me if he speaks one
syllable more he will cause great mischief

Alon Will he so Ill stop my ears away with him

Mel Your daughters are yet in the garden hidden by this fellow and
his accomplices

Alon At the same time drowning him Ill stop my ears Ill stop
my ears

Bel Mask At the same time also A thief a thief away with him

Alon He thought to have borne us down with his confidence

Enter another Servant

Serv Sir with much ado we have got out the key and opened the door

Alon Then as I told you run quickly to the corrigidor and desire
him to come hither in person to examine a malefactor WILDBLOOD
sneezes within Hark what noise is that within I think one sneezes

Bel One of the devils I warrant you has got a cold with being so
long out of the fire

Alon Bless his devilship as I may say
                                             WILDBLOOD sneezes again

Serv To Don ALONZO This is a mans voice do not suffer yourself
to be deceived so grossly sir

Mask A mans voice thats a good one indeed that you should live to
these years and yet be so silly as not to know a man from a devil

Alon Theres more int than I imagined Hold
up your torch and go in first Pedro and Ill follow
you

Mask No let me have the honour to be your usher
                                         Takes the torch and goes in

Mask Within Help help help

Alon Whats the matter

Bel Stir not upon your life sir

Enter MASKALL again without the torch

Mask I was no sooner entered but a huge giant seized my torch and
felled me along with the very whiff of his breath as he passed by me

Alon Bless us

Bel At the door to them within Pass out now while you have
time in the dark The officers of justice will be here immediately the
gardendoor is open for you

Alon What are you muttering there sir

Bel Only dismissing these spirits of darkness that they may trouble
you no furtherGo out I say
                 They all come out upon the stage groping their way
                                WILDBLOOD falls into ALONZOS hands

Alon I have caught somebody Are these your spirits Another light

Mask Slipping between ALON and WILD Tis Maskall you have
caught sir do you mean to strangle me that you press me so hard
between your arms

Alon Letting WILD go Is it thee Maskall I durst have sworn
it had been another

Bel Make haste now before the candle comes
                                  AURELIA falls into ALONZOS arms

Alon Now I have another

Aur Tis Maskall you have caught sir

Alon No I thank you niece this artifice is too gross I know your
voice a little better What ho bring lights there

Bel Her impertinence has ruined all

Enter Servants with lights and swords drawn

Serv Sir the corrigidor is coming according to your desire In the
mean time we have secured the garden doors

Alon Im glad ont Ill make some of them severe examples

Wild Nay then as we have lived merrily so let us die together But
well shew the Don some sport first

Theo What will become of us

Jac Well die for company Nothing vexes me but that I am not a man
to have one thrust at that malicious old father of mine before I go

Lop Let us break our way through the corrigidors band

Jac A match ifaith Well venture our bodies with you You shall
put the baggage in the middle

Wild He that pierces thee I say no more but I shall be somewhat
angry with himTo ALON In the mean time I arrest you sir in
the behalf of this good company As the corrigidor uses us so well
use you

Alon You do not mean to murder me

Bel You murder yourself if you force us to it

Wild Give me a razor there that I may scrape his weeson that the
bristles may not hinder me when I come to cut it

Bel What need you bring matters to that extremity You have your
ransom in your hand Here are three men and there are three women you
understand me

Jac If not heres a sword and theres a throat you understand me

Alon This is very hard

Theo The propositions are good and marriage is as honourable as it
used to be

Beat You had best let your daughters live branded with the name of
strumpets for whatever befals the men that will be sure to be their
share

Alon I can put them into a nunnery

All the Women A nunnery

Jac I would have thee to know thou graceless old man that I defy a
nunnery Name a nunnery once more and I disown thee for my father

Lop You know the custom of the country in this case sir Tis
either death or marriage The business will certainly be public and if
they die they have sworn you shall bear them company

Alon Since it must be so run Pedro and stop the corrigidor Tell
him it was only a carnival merriment which I mistook for a rape and
robbery

Jac Why now you are a dutiful father again and I receive you into
grace

Bel Among the rest of your mistakes sir I must desire you to let my
astrology pass for one My mathematics and art magic were only a
carnival device and now thats ending I have more mind to deal with
the flesh than with the devil

Alon No astrologer tis impossible

Mask I have known him sir these seven years and dare take my oath
he has been always an utter stranger to the stars and indeed to any
thing that belongs to heaven

Lop Then I have been cozened among the rest

Theo And I but I forgive him

Beat I hope you will forgive me madam who have been the cause ont
but what he wants in astrology he shall make up to you some other way
Ill pass my word for him

Alon I hope you are both gentlemen

Bel As good as the cid himself sir

Alon And for your religion right Romans

Wild As ever was Mark Anthony

Alon For your fortunes and courages

Mask They are both desperate sir especially their fortunes

Theo To BEL You should not have had my consent so soon but only
to revenge myself upon the falseness of Don Melchor

Aur I must avow that gratitude for Don Lopez is as prevalent with
me as revenge against Don Melchor

Alon Lent you know begins tomorrow when thats over marriage
will be proper

Jac If I stay till after Lent I shall be to marry when I have no
love left Ill not bate you an ace of tonight father I mean to bury
this man ere Lent be done and get me another before Easter

Alon Well make a night ont then
                                                Giving his daughters

Wild Jacintha Wildblood welcome to me Since our stars have doomed
it so we cannot help it but twas a mere trick of fate to catch us
thus at unawares to draw us in with a what do you lack as we passed
by Had we once separated tonight we should have had more wit than
ever to have met again tomorrow

Jac Tis true we shot each other flying We were both upon the wing
I find and had we passed this critical minute I should have gone for
the Indies and you for Greenland ere we had met in a bed upon
consideration

Mask You have quarrelled twice tonight without bloodshed beware the
third time

Jac Apropos I have been retrieving an old song of a lover that was
ever quarrelling with his mistress I think it will fit our amour so
well that if you please Ill give it you for an epithalamium and you
shall sing it
                                                   Gives him a paper

Wild I never sung in all my life nor ever durst try when I was
alone for fear of braying

Jac Just me up and down but for a frolic lets sing together for
I am sure if we cannot sing now we shall never have cause when we are
married

Wild Begin then give me my key and Ill set my voice tot

Jac Fa la fa la fa la

Wild Fala fala fala Is this your best upon the faith of a virgin

Jac Ay by the muses I am at my pitch

Wild Then do your worst and let the company be judge who sings

Wild I shall be revenged with putting you into your smock anon St
George for me

Jac St James for me Come start sir


  SONG

  Damon     Celimena of my heart
              None shall eer bereave you
              If with your good leave I may
              Quarrel with you once a day
              I will never leave you

  Celimena  Passions but an empty name
              Where respect is wanting
              Damon you mistake your aim
              Hang your heart and burn your flame
              If you must be ranting

  Damon     Love as dull and muddy is
              As decaying liquor
              Anger sets it on the lees
              And refines it by degrees
              Till it works the quicker

  Celimena  Love by quarrels to beget
              Wisely you endeavour
              With a grave physicians wit
              Who to cure an ague fit
              Put me in a fever

  Damon     Anger rouses love to fight
              And his only bait is
              Tis the spur to dull delight
              And is but an eager bite
              When desire at height is

  Celimena  If such drops of heat can fall
              In our wooing weather
              If such drops of heat can fall
              We shall have the devil and all
              When we come together

Wild Your judgment gentlemen a man or a maid

Bel An you make no better harmony after you are married than you
have before you are the miserablest couple in Christendom

Wild Tis no great matter if I had had a good voice she would have
spoiled it before tomorrow

Bel When Maskall has married Beatrix you may learn of her

Mask You shall put her life into a lease then

Wild Upon condition that when I drop into your house from hunting I
may set my slippers at your door as a Turk does at a Jews that you
may not enter

Theo And while you refresh yourself within he shall wind the horn
without

Mask Ill throw up my lease first

Bel Why thou wouldst not be so impudent to marry Beatrix for
thyself only

Beat For all his ranting and tearing now Ill pass my word he shall
degenerate into as tame and peaceable a husband as a civil woman would
wish to have

Enter Don MELCHOR with a Servant

Mel Sir

Alon I know what you would say but your discovery comes too late
now

Mel Why the ladies are found

Aur But their inclinations are lost I can assure you

Jac Look you sir there goes the game Your platefleet is divided
half for Spain and half for England

Theo You are justly punished for loving two

Mel Yet I have the comfort of a cast lover I will think well of
myself and despise my mistresses
                                                                Exit

DANCE

Bel Enough enough lets end the carnival abed

Wild And for these gentlemen wheneer they try May they all speed
as soon and well as I
                                                              Exeunt




EPILOGUE


  My part being small I have had time today
  To mark your various censures of our play
  First looking for a judgment or a wit
  Like Jews I saw them scattered through the pit
  And where a knot of smilers lent an ear
  To one that talked I knew the foe was there
  The club of jests went round he who had none
  Borrowed othe next and told it for his own
  Among the rest they kept a fearful stir
  In whispering that he stole the Astrologer
  And said betwixt a French and English plot
  He eased his halftired muse on pace and trot
  Up starts a Monsieur new come oer and warm
  In the French stoop and the pullback othe arm
  Morbleu dit il and cocks I am a rogue
  But he has quite spoiled the feigned Astrologue
  Pox says another heres so great a stir
  With a son of a whore farce thats regular
  A rule where nothing must decorum shock
  Damme tis as dull as dining by the clock
  An evening Why the devil should we be vext
  Whether he gets the wench this night or next
  When I heard this I to the poet went           
  Told him the house was full of discontent       
  And asked him what excuse he could invent       
  He neither swore or stormed as poets do
  But most unlike an author vowed twas true
  Yet said he used the French like enemies
  And did not steal their plots but made them prize
  But should he all the pains and charges count
  Of taking them the bill so high would mount
  That like prizegoods which through the office come
  He could have had them much more cheap at home
  He still must write and banquierlike each day
  Accept new bills and he must break or pay
  When through his hands such sums must yearly run
  You cannot think the stock is all his own
  His haste his other errors might excuse
  But theres no mercy for a guilty muse
  For like a mistress she must stand or fall
  And please you to a height or not at all




  TYRANNIC LOVE

  OR THE

  ROYAL MARTYR

  A

  TRAGEDY




TYRANNIC LOVE


The Royal Martyr is one of Drydens most characteristic productions
The character of Maximin in particular is drawn on his boldest plan
and only equalled by that of Almanzor in the Conquest of Granada
Indeed although in action the latter exhibits a larger proportion of
that extravagant achievement peculiar to the heroic drama it may be
questioned whether the language of Maximin does not abound more with
the flights of fancy which hover betwixt the confines of the grand and
the bombast and which our author himself has aptly termed the Dalilahs
of the theatre Certainly in some of those rants which occasionally
burst from the emperor our poet appears shorn of his locks as for
example

    Look to it Gods for you the aggressors are
    Keep you your rain and sunshine in your skies
    And Ill keep back my flame and sacrifice
    Your trade of heaven will soon be at a stand
    And all your goods lie dead upon your hand

Indeed Dryden himself acknowledged in the Dedication to the Spanish
Friar that some verses of Maximin and Almanzor cry vengeance upon him
for their extravagance and heartily wishes them in the same fire with
Statius and Chapman But he pleads in apology that he knew they were
bad enough to please even when he wrote them although he is now
resolved no longer to seek credit from the approbation of fools Johnson
has doubted with apparent reason whether this confession be
sufficiently ample and whether the poet did not really give his love to
those enticing seducers of his imagination although he contemned them
in his more sober judgment In the Prologue he has boldly stated and
justified his determination to rush forwards and hazard the disgrace of
a fall rather than the loss of the race Certainly a genius which
dared so greatly as that of Dryden cannot always be expected to check
its flight upon the verge of propriety and we are often hurried along
with it into the extravagant and bombast when we can seldom discover
the error till a second reading of the passage Take for example the
often quoted account of the death of Charinus

    With a fierce haste he led our troops the way
    While fiery showers of sulphur on him rained
    Nor left he till the battlements he gained
    There with a forest of their darts he strove
    And stood like Capaneus defying Jove
    With his broad sword the boldest beating down
    While fate grew pale lest he should win the town
    And turned the iron leaves of its dark book
    To make new dooms or mend what it mistook
    Till sought by many deaths he sunk though late
    And by his fall asserted doubtful fate

Although this passage upon examination will be found to contain much
tumid bombast yet like others in the same tone it conveys at first
a dark impression of grandeur and sublimity which only vanishes on a
critical examination Such passages pronounced with due emphasis on the
stage will always meet with popular applause They are like the
fanciful shapes into which a mist is often wreathed it requires a near
approach and an attentive consideration to discover their emptiness
and vanity On the other hand we meet with many passages in Maximin
where the impression of sublimity becomes more deep in proportion to
the attention we bestow on them Such is the speech of St Catharine to
her mother

    Could we live always life were worth our cost
    But now we keep with care what must be lost
    Here we stand shivering on the bank and cry
    When we should plunge into eternity
    One moment ends our pain
    And yet the shock of death we dare not stand
    By thought scarce measured and too swift for sand
    Tis but because the living death neer knew
    They fear to prove it as a thing thats new
    Let me the experiment before you try
    Ill show you first how easy tis to die

In the same scene occurs an instance of a different kind of beauty less
commonly found in Dryden The tender description given by Felicia of her
attachment to her child in infancy is exquisitely beautiful

The introduction of magic and of the astral spirits who have little to
do with the catastrophe was perhaps contrived for the sake of music and
scenery The supernatural has however been fashionable at all periods
and we learn from a passage in the dedication to Prince Arthur that
the Duchess of Monmouth whom Dryden calls his first and best patroness
was pleased with the parts of airy and earthy spirits and with that
fairy kind of writing which depends upon the force of imagination It
is probable therefore that in a play inscribed to her husband that
style of composition was judiciously intermingled to which our poet
knew the duchess was partial There is much fine description in the
first account of the wizard but the lyrical dialogue of the spirits is
rather puerile and is ridiculed with great severity in the
Rehearsal

Mr Malone has fixed the first acting of this play to the end of  or
beginning of  It was printed in  and a revised edition came
forth in 




  TO THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS PRINCE

  JAMES

  DUKE OF MONMOUTH AND BUCCLEUGH

  ONE OF HIS MAJESTYS MOST HONOURABLE PRIVYCOUNCIL AND KNIGHT OF THE
  MOST NOBLE ORDER OF THE GARTER CK


Sir

The favourable reception which your excellent lady afforded to one of my
former playsL has encouraged me to double my presumption in
addressing this to your graces patronage So dangerous a thing it is to
admit a poet into your family that you can never afterwards be free
from the chiming of ill verses perpetually sounding in your ears and
more troublesome than the neighbourhood of steeples I have been
favourable to myself in this expression a zealous fanatick would have
gone farther and have called me the serpent who first presented the
fruit of my poetry to the wife and so gained the opportunity to seduce
the husband Yet I am ready to avow a crime so advantageous to me but
the world which will condemn my boldness I am sure will justify and
applaud my choice All men will join with me in the adoration which I
pay you they would wish only I had brought you a more noble sacrifice
Instead of an heroick play you might justly expect an heroick poem
filled with the past glories of your ancestors and the future
certainties of your own Heaven has already taken care to form you for
an hero You have all the advantages of mind and body and an
illustrious birth conspiring to render you an extraordinary person The
Achilles and the Rinaldo are present in you even above their originals
you only want a Homer or a Tasso to make you equal to them Youth
beauty and courage all which you possess in the height of their
perfection are the most desirable gifts of heaven and heaven is never
prodigal of such treasures but to some uncommon purpose So goodly a
fabric was never framed by an Almighty architect for a vulgar guest He
shewed the value which he set upon your mind when he took care to have
it so nobly and so beautifully lodged To a graceful fashion and
deportment of body you have joined a winning conversation and an easy
greatness derived to you from the best and bestbeloved of princes
And with a great power of obliging the world has observed in you a
desire to oblige even beyond your power This and all that I can say
on so excellent and large a subject is only history in which fiction
has no part I can employ nothing of poetry in it any more than I do in
that humble protestation which I make to continue ever

    Your Graces most obedient

PREFACE

I was moved to write this play by many reasons Amongst others the
commands of some persons of honour for whom I have a most particular
respect were daily sounding in my ears that it would be of good
example to undertake a poem of this nature Neither were my own
inclinations wanting to second their desires I considered that pleasure
was not the only end of poesy and that even the instructions of
morality were not so wholly the business of a poet as that the precepts
and examples of piety were to be omitted For to leave that employment
altogether to the clergy were to forget that religion was first taught
in verse which the laziness or dulness of succeeding priesthood
turned afterwards into prose and it were also to grant which I never
shall that representations of this kind may not as well be conducing to
holiness as to good manners Yet far be it from me to compare the use
of dramatick poesy with that of divinity I only maintain against the
enemies of the stage that patterns of piety decently represented and
equally removed from the extremes of superstition and profaneness may
be of excellent use to second the precepts of our religion By the
harmony of words we elevate the mind to a sense of devotion as our
solemn musick which is inarticulate poesy does in churches and by the
lively images of piety adorned by action through the senses allure the
soul which while it is charmed in a silent joy of what it sees and
hears is struck at the same time with a secret veneration of things
celestial and is wound up insensibly into the practice of that which it
admires Now if instead of this we sometimes see on our theatres the
examples of vice rewarded or at least unpunished yet it ought not to
be an argument against the art any more than the extravagances and
impieties of the pulpit in the late times of rebellion can be against
the office and dignity of the clergy

But many times it happens that poets are wrongfully accused as it is
my own case in this very play where I am charged by some ignorant or
malicious persons with no less crimes than profaneness and irreligion

The part of Maximin against which these holy critics so much declaim
was designed by me to set off the character of St Catharine And
those who have read the Roman history may easily remember that
Maximin was not only a bloody tyrant vastus corpore animo ferus as
Herodian describes him but also a persecutor of the church against
which he raised the Sixth Persecution So that whatsoever he speaks or
acts in this tragedy is no more than a record of his life and manners
a picture as near as I could take it from the original If with much
pains and some success I have drawn a deformed piece there is as much
of art and as near an imitation of nature in a lazar as in a Venus
Maximin was an heathen and what he speaks against religion is in
contempt of that which he professed He defies the gods of Rome which
is no more than St Catharine might with decency have done If it be
urged that a person of such principles who scoffs at any religion
ought not to be presented on the stage why then are the lives and
sayings of so many wicked and profane persons recorded in the Holy
Scriptures I know it will be answered That a due use may be made of
them that they are remembered with a brand of infamy fixed upon them
and set as seamarks for those who behold them to avoid And what other
use have I made of Maximin have I proposed him as a pattern to be
imitated whom even for his impiety to his false gods I have so
severely punished Nay as if I had foreseen this objection I purposely
removed the scene of the play which ought to have been at Alexandria in
Egypt where St Catharine suffered and laid it under the walls of
Aquileia in Italy where Maximin was slain that the punishment of his
crime might immediately succeed its execution

This reader is what I owed to my just defence and the due reverence
of that religion which I profess to which all men who desire to be
esteemed good or honest are obliged I have neither leisure nor
occasion to write more largely on this subject because I am already
justified by the sentence of the best and most discerning prince in the
world by the suffrage of all unbiassed judges and above all by the
witness of my own conscience which abhors the thought of such a crime
to which I ask leave to add my outward conversation which shall never
be justly taxed with the note of atheism or profaneness

In what else concerns the play I shall be brief For the faults of the
writing and contrivance I leave them to the mercy of the reader For I
am as little apt to defend my own errors as to find those of other
poets Only I observe that the great censors of wit and poetry
either produce nothing of their own or what is more ridiculous than any
thing they reprehend Much of ill nature and a very little judgment go
far in finding the mistakes of writers

I pretend not that any thing of mine can be correct This poem
especially which was contrived and written in seven weeks though
afterwards hindered by many accidents from a speedy representation
which would have been its just excuse

Yet the scenes are every where unbroken and the unities of place and
time more exactly kept than perhaps is requisite in a tragedy or at
least than I have since preserved them in the Conquest of Granada

I have not everywhere observed the equality of numbers in my verse
partly by reason of my haste but more especially because I would not
have my sense a slave to syllables

It is easy to discover that I have been very bold in my alteration of
the story which of itself was too barren for a play and that I have
taken from the church two martyrs in the persons of Porphyrius and the
empress who suffered for the Christian faith under the tyranny of
Maximin

I have seen a French play called the Martyrdom of St Catharine But
those who have read it will soon clear me from stealing out of so dull
an author I have only borrowed a mistake from him of one Maximin for
another for finding him in the French poet called the son of a
Thracian herdsman and an Alane woman I too easily believed him to have
been the same Maximin mentioned in Herodian Till afterwards consulting
Eusebius and Metaphrastes I found the Frenchman had betrayed me into an
error when it was too late to alter it by mistaking that first Maximin
for a second the contemporary of Constantine the Great and one of the
usurpers of the eastern empire

But neither was the other name of my play more fortunate for as some
who had heard of a tragedy of St Catharine imagined I had taken my plot
from thence so others who had heard of another play called LAmour
Tyrannique with the same ignorance accused me to have borrowed my
design from it because I have accidentally given my play the same
title not having to this day seen it and knowing only by report that
such a comedy is extant in French under the name of Monsieur Scudery

As for what I have said of astral or arial spirits it is no invention
of mine but taken from those who have written on that subject Whether
there are such beings or not it concerns not me it is sufficient for
my purpose that many have believed the affirmative and that these
heroic representations which are of the same nature with the epic are
not limited but with the extremest bounds of what is credible

For the little critics who pleased themselves with thinking they have
found a flaw in that line of the prologue

    And he who servilely creeps after sense Is safe cM

as if I patronized my own nonsense I may reasonably suppose they have
never read Horace Serpit humi tutus c are his words He who
creeps after plain dull common sense is safe from committing
absurdities but can never reach any height or excellence of wit and
sure I could not mean that any excellence were to be found in
nonsense With the same ignorance or malice they would accuse me for
usingempty arms when I write of a ghost or shadow which has only
the appearance of a body or limbs and is empty or void of flesh and
blood and vacuis amplectitur ulnis was an expression of Ovids on
the same subject Some fool before them had charged me in The Indian
Emperor with nonsense in these words

    And follow fate which does too fast pursue

Which was borrowed from Virgil in the eleventh of his neids

    Eludit gyro interior sequiturque sequentemN

I quote not these to prove that I never writ nonsense but only to
shew that they are so unfortunate as not to have found it

                                                              VALE

PROLOGUE


  Selflove which never rightly understood
  Makes poets still conclude their plays are good
  And malice in all critics reigns so high
  That for small errors they whole plays decry
  So that to see this fondness and that spite
  Youd think that none but madmen judge or write
  Therefore our poet as he thinks not fit
  T impose upon you what he writes for wit
  So hopes that leaving you your censures free      
  You equal judges of the whole will be               
  They judge but half who only faults will see       
  Poets like lovers should be bold and dare
  They spoil their business with an overcare
  And he who servilely creeps after sense
  Is safe but neer will reach an excellence
  Hence tis our poet in his conjuring
  Allowed his fancy the full scope and swing
  But when a tyrant for his theme he had
  He loosed the reins and bid his muse run mad
  And though he stumbles in a full career
  Yet rashness is a better fault than fear
  He saw his way but in so swift a pace
  To chuse the ground might be to lose the race
  They then who of each trip the advantage take
  Find but those faults which they want wit to make

SCENE IA Camp or Pavilion Royal

Enter MAXIMIN CHARINUS PLACIDIUS ALBINUS VALERIUS APOLLONIUS
and Guards

  Max Thus far my arms have with success been crowned
  And found no stop or vanquished what they found
  The German lakes my legions have oerpast
  With all the bars which art or nature cast
  My foes in watery fastnesses inclosed
  I fought alone to their whole war exposed
  Did first the depth of trembling marshes sound
  And fixed my eagles in unfaithful ground
  By force submitted to the Roman sway
  Fierce nations and unknowing to obey
  And now for my reward ungrateful Rome
  For which I fought abroad rebels at home

  Alb Yet tis their fear which does this war maintain
  They cannot brook a martial monarchs reign
  Your valour would their sloth too much accuse
  And therefore like themselves they princes chuse

  Plac Two tame gownd princes who at ease debate
  In lazy chairs the business of the state
  Who reign but while the people they can please
  And only know the little arts of peace

  Char In fields they dare not fight where honour calls
  But breathe a faint defiance from their walls
  The very noise of war their souls does wound
  They quake but hearing their own trumpets sound

  Val An easy summons but for form they wait
  And to your fame will open wide the gate

  Plac I wish our fame that swift success may find
  But conquests sir are easily designed
  However soft within themselves they are
  To you they will be valiant by despair
  For having once been guilty well they know
  To a revengeful prince they still are so

  Alb Tis true that since the senates succours came
  They grow more bold

  Max That senates but a name
  Or they are pageant princes which they make
  That power they give away they would partake
  Two equal powers two different ways will draw
  While each may check and give the other law
  True they secure propriety and peace
  But are not fit an empire to increase
  When they should aid their prince the slaves dispute
  And fear success should make him absolute
  They let foes conquer to secure the state
  And lend a sword whose edge themselves rebate

  Char When to increase the gods you late are gone
  Ill swiftly chuse to die or reign alone
  But these half kings our courage cannot fright
  The thrifty state will bargain ere they fight
  Give just so much for every victory
  And rather lose a fight than overbuy

  Max Since all delays are dangerous in war
  Your men Albinus for assault prepare
  Crispinus and Meniphilus I hear
  Two consulars these Aquileians cheer
  By whom they may if we protract the time
  Be taught the courage to defend their crime

  Plac Put off the assault but only for this day
  No loss can come by such a small delay

  Char We are not sure tomorrow will be ours
  Wars have like love their favourable hours
  Let us use all for if we lose one day
  That white one in the crowd may slip away

  Max Fates dark recesses we can never find
  But fortune at some hours to all is kind
  The lucky have whole days which still they chuse
  The unlucky have but hours and those they lose

  Plac I have consulted one who reads heavens doom
  And sees as present things which are to come
  Tis that Nigrinus made by your command
  A tribune in the new Pannonian band
  Him have I seen on Isters banks he stood
  Where last we wintered bind the headlong flood
  In sudden ice and where most swift it flows
  In crystal nets the wondring fishes close
  Then with a moments thaw the streams enlarge
  And from the mesh the twinkling guests discharge
  In a deep vale or near some ruined wall
  He would the ghosts of slaughtered soldiers call
  Who slow to wounded bodies did repair
  And loth to enter shivered in the air
  These his dread wand did to short life compel
  And forced the fates of battles to foretel

  Max Tis wonderous strange But good Placidius say
  What prophecies Nigrinus of this day

  Plac In a lone tent all hung with black I saw
  Where in a square he did a circle draw
  Four angles made by that circumference
  Bore holy words inscribed of mystic sense
  When first a hollow wind began to blow
  The sky grew black and bellied down more low
  Around the fields did nimble lightning play
  Which offered us by fits and snatched the day
  Midst this was heard the shrill and tender cry
  Of wellpleased ghosts which in the storm did fly
  Danced to and fro and skimmed along the ground
  Till to the magic circle they were bound
  They coursing it while we were fenced within
  We saw this dreadful scene of fate begin

  Char Speak without fear what did the vision shew

  Plac A curtain drawn presented to our view
  A town besieged and on the neighbouring plain
  Lay heaps of visionary soldiers slain
  A rising mist obscured the gloomy head
  Of one who in imperial robes lay dead
  Near this in fetters stood a virgin crowned
  Whom many Cupids strove in vain to wound
  A voiceTomorrow still Tomorrow rung
  Anotherlo lo Pan sung

  Char Visions and oracles still doubtful are
  And neer expounded till the event of war
  The gods foreknowledge on our swords will wait
  If we fight well they must foreshow good fate

To them a Centurion

  Cent A rising dust which troubles all the air
  And this way travels shews some army near

  Char I hear the sound of trumpets from afar
                                                        Exit ALBINUS

  Max It seems the voice of triumph not of war

To them ALBINUS again

  Alb Health and success our emperor attends
  The forces marching on the plain are friends
  Porphyrius whom you Egypts prtor made
  Is come from Alexandria to your aid

  Max It well becomes the conduct and the care
  Of one so famed and fortunate in war
  You must resign Placidius your command
  To him I promised the prtorian band
  Your duty in your swift compliance show
  I will provide some other charge for you

  Plac May Csars pleasure ever be obeyed
  With that submission which by me is paid
  Now all the curses envy ever knew
  Or could invent Porphyrius pursue
                                                               Aside

  Alb Placidius does too tamely bear his loss
                                                         To CHARINUS
  This new pretender will all power engross
  All things must now by his direction move
  And you sir must resign your fathers love

  Char Yes every name to his repute must bow
  There grow no bays for any other brow
  He blasts my early honour in the bud
  Like some tall tree the monster of the wood
  Oershading all which under him would grow
  He sheds his venom on the plants below

  Alb You must some noble action undertake
  Equal with his your own renown to make

  Char I am not for a slothful envy born
  Ill dot this day in the dire visions scorn
  He comes We two like the twin stars appear
  Never to shine together in one sphere
                                          Exeunt CHAR and ALBINUS

Enter PORPHYRIUS attended

  Max Porphyrius welcome welcome as the light
  To cheerful birds or as to lovers night
  Welcome as what thou bringst me victory

  Por That waits sir on your arms and not on me
  You left a conquest more than half achieved
  And for whose easiness I almost grieved
  Yours only the Egyptian laurels are
  I bring you but the reliques of your war
  The Christian princess to receive your doom
  Is from her conquered Alexandria come
  Her mother in another vessel sent
  A storm surprised nor know I the event
  Both from your bounty must receive their state
  Or must on your triumphant chariot wait

  Max From me they can expect no grace whose minds
  An execrable superstition blinds

  Apol The gods who raised you to the worlds command
  Require these victims from your grateful hand

  Por To minds resolved the threats of death are vain
  They run to fires and there enjoy their pain
  Not Mucius made more haste his hand to expose
  To greedy flames than their whole bodies those

  Max How to their own destruction they are blind
  Zeal is the pious madness of the mind

  Por They all our famed philosophers defy
  And would our faith by force of reason try

  Apol I beg it sir by all the powers divine
  That in their right this combat may be mine

  Max It shall and fifty doctors of our laws
  Be added to you to maintain the cause

Enter BERENICE the Empress VALERIA daughter to the Emperor and
EROTION

  Plac The empress and your daughter sir are here

  Por What dangers in those charming eyes appear
                                              Looking on the Empress
  How my old wounds are opened at this view
  And in my murderers presence bleed anew

  Max I did expect your coming to partake
                                                       To the Ladies
  The general gladness which my triumphs make
  You did Porphyrius as a courtier know
  But as a conqueror behold him now

  Ber You know I read it in your blushing face
                                                              To POR
  To merit better than receive a grace
  And I know better silently to own
  Than with vain words to pay your service done

  Por Princes like gods reward ere we deserve
                                           Kneeling to kiss her hand
  And pay us in permitting us to serve
  O might I still grow here and never move
                                                               Lower

  Ber How dangerous are these ecstacies of love
  He shews his passion to a thousand eyes
  He cannot stir nor can I bid him rise
  That word my heart refuses to my tongue
                                                               Aside

  Max Madam you let the general kneel too long

  Por Too long as if eternity were so
                                                               Aside

  Ber Rise good Porphyriussince it must be so
                                                               Aside

  Por Like hermits from a vision I retire
                                                              Rising
  With eyes too weak to see what I admire
                                                               Aside

  Val The empress knows your worth but sir there be
                                To PORPHYRIUS who kisses her hand
  Those who can value it as high as she
  And tis but just since in my fathers cause
  You fought your valour should have my applause

  Plac O jealousy how art thou eagleeyed
  She loves and would her love in praises hide
  How am I bound this rival to pursue
  Who ravishes my love and fortune too
                                                               Aside
                                   A dead march within and trumpets

  Max Somewhat of mournful sure my ears does wound
  Like the hoarse murmurs of a trumpets sound
  And drums unbraced with soldiers broken cries

Enter ALBINUS

  Albinus whence proceeds this dismal noise

  Alb Too soon youll know what I want words to tell

  Max How fares my son Is my Charinus well
  Not answer me Oh my prophetic fear

  Alb How can I speak or how sir can you hear
  Imagine that which you would most deplore
  And that which I would speak is it or more

  Max Thy mournful message in thy looks I read
  Is he oh that I live to ask it dead

  Alb Sir

  Max Stay if thou speakst that word thou speakst thy last
  Some God now if he dares relate whats past
  Say but hes dead that God shall mortal be

  Alb Then what I dare not speak look back and see
                                  CHARINUS borne in dead by soldiers

  Max See nothing eyes henceforth but death and woe
  Youve done me the worst office you can do
  Youve shewn me destinys preposterous crime
  An unripe fate disclosed ere natures time

  Plac Assuage great prince your passion lest you shew
  Theres somewhat in your soul which fate can bow

  Por Fortune should by your greatness be controuled
  Arm your great mind and let her take no hold

  Max To tame philosophers teach constancy
  There is no farther use of it in me
  Godsbut why name I you
  All that was worth a prayer to you is gone
  I ask not back my virtue but my son

  Alb His too great thirst of fame his ruin brought
  Though sir beyond all human force he fought

  Plac This was my vision of this fatal day

  Alb With a fierce haste he led our troops the way
  While fiery showers of sulphur on him rained
  Nor left he till the battlements he gained
  There with a forest of their darts he strove
  And stood like Capaneus defying Jove
  With his broad sword the boldest beating down
  While fate grew pale lest he should win the town
  And turned the iron leaves of its dark book
  To make new dooms or mend what it mistook
  Till sought by many deaths he sunk though late
  And by his fall asserted doubtful fate

  Val Oh my dear brother whom heaven let us see
  And would not longer suffer him to be

  Max And didst not thou a death with honour chuse
                                                              To ALB
  But impudently livst to bring this news
  After his loss how didst thou dare to breathe
  But thy base ghost shall follow him in death
  A decimation I will strictly make
  Of all who my Charinus did forsake
  And of each legion each centurion
  Shall diePlacidius see my pleasure done

  Por Sir you will lose by this severity
  Your soldiers hearts

  Max Why they take pay to die

  Por Then spare Albinus only

  Max I consent
  To leave his life to be his punishment
  Discharged from trust branded with infamy
  Let him live on till he ask leave to die

  Ber Let me petition for him

  Max I have said
  And will not be intreated but obeyed
  But empress whence does your compassion grow

  Ber You need not ask it since my birth you know
  The race of Antonines was named the good
  I draw my pity from my royal blood

  Max Still must I be upbraided with your line
  I know you speak it in contempt of mine
  But your late brother did not prize me less
  Because I could not boast of images
  And the Gods own me more when they decreed
  A Thracian shepherd should your line succeed

  Ber The Gods O do not name the powers divine
  They never mingled their decrees with thine
  My brother gave me to thee for a wife
  And for my dowry thou didst take his life

  Max The Gods by many victories have shewn
  That they my merits and his death did own

  Ber Yes they have owned it witness this just day
  When they begin thy mischiefs to repay
  See the reward of all thy wicked care
  Before thee thy succession ended there
  Yet but in part my brothers ghost is pleased
  Restless till all the groaning world be eased
  For me no other happiness I own
  Than to have borne no issue to thy throne

  Max Provoke my rage no farther lest I be
  Revenged at once upon the gods and thee

  Por What horrid tortures seize my labouring mind
  O only excellent of all thy kind
  To hear thee threatened while I idle stand
  Heaven was I born to fear a tyrants hand
                                                               Aside

  Max to Ber Hence from my sightthy blood
  If thou dost stay

  Ber Tyrant too well to that thou knowest the way
                                                               Going

  Por Let baser souls from falling fortunes fly
  Ill pay my duty to her though I die
                                                   Exit leading her

  Max What made Porphyrius so officious be
  The action looked as done in scorn of me

  Val It did indeed some little freedom shew
  But somewhat to his services you owe

  Max Yet if I thought it his presumption were

  Plac Perhaps he did not your displeasure hear

  Max My anger was too loud not to be heard

  Plac Im loth to think he did it not regard

  Max How not regard

  Val Placidius you foment
  On too light grounds my fathers discontent
  But when an action does two faces wear
  Tis justice to believe what is most fair
  I think that knowing what respect there rests
  For her late brother in the soldiers breasts
  He went to serve the emperor and designed
  Only to calm the tempest in her mind
  Lest some sedition in the camp should rise

  Max I ever thought him loyal as hes wise
  Since therefore all the Gods their spite have shewn
  To rob my age of a successive throne
  And you who now remain
  The only issue of my former bed
  In empire cannot by your sex succeed
  To bind Porphyrius firmly to the state
  I will this day my Csar him create
  And daughter I will give him you for wife

  Val O day the best and happiest of my life

  Plac O day the most accurst I ever knew
                                                               Aside

  Max See to my son performed each funeral due
  Then to the toils of war we will return
  And make our enemies our losses mourn
                                                              Exeunt

SCENE IThe Royal Camp

Enter BERENICE and PORPHYRIUS

  Ber Porphyrius you too far did tempt your fate
  In owning her the emperor does hate
  Tis true your duty to me it became
  But praising that I must your conduct blame

  Por Not to have owned my zeal at such a time
  Were to sin higher than your tyrants crime

  Ber Twas too much my disgrace to accompany
  A silent wish had been enough for me

  Por Wishes are aids faint servants may supply
  Who ask heaven for you what themselves deny
  Could I do less than my respect to pay
  Where I before had given my heart away

  Ber You fail in that respect you seem to bear
  When you speak words unfit for me to hear

  Por Yet you did once accept those vows I paid

  Ber Those vows were then to Berenice made
  But cannot now be heard without a sin
  When offered to the wife of Maximin

  Por Has then the change of fortune changed your will
  Ah why are you not Berenice still
  To Maximin you once declared your hate
  Your marriage was a sacrifice to th state
  Your brother made it to secure his throne
  Which this man made a step to mount it on

  Ber Whatever Maximin has been or is
  I am to bear since heaven has made me his
  For wives who must themselves of power divest
  When they love blindly for their peace love best

  Por If mutual love be vowed when faith you plight
  Then he who forfeits first has lost his right

  Ber Husbands a forfeiture of love may make
  But what avails the forfeit none can take
  As in a general wreck
  The pirate sinks with his illgotten gains
  And nothing to anothers use remains
  So by his loss no gain to you can fall
  The sea and vast destruction swallows all

  Por Yet he who from the shore the wreck descries
  May lawfully enrich him with the prize

  Ber Who sees the wreck can yet no title plead
  Till he be sure the owner first is dead

  Por If that be all the claim I want to love
  This pirate of your heart Ill soon remove
  And at one stroke the world and you set free

  Ber Leave to the care of heaven that world and me

  Por Heaven as its instrument my courage sends

  Ber Heaven neer sent those who fight for private ends
  We both are bound by trust and must be true
  I to his bed and to his empire you
  For he who to the bad betrays his trust
  Though he does good becomes himself unjust

  Por When Brutus did from Csar Rome redeem
  The act was good

  Ber But was not good in him
  You see the Gods adjudged it parricide
  By dooming the event on Csars side
  Tis virtue not to be obliged at all
  Or not conspire our benefactors fall

  Por You doom me then to suffer all this ill
  And yet I doom myself to love you still

  Ber Dare not Porphyrius suffer then with me
  Since what for him I for myself decree

  Por How can I bear those griefs you disapprove

  Ber To ease them Ill permit you still to love

  Por That will but haste my death if you think fit
  Not to reward but barely to permit
  Love without hope does like a torture wound
  Which makes me reach in pain to touch the ground

  Ber If hope then to your life so needful be
  Hope still

  Por Blest news

  Ber But hope in heaven not me

  Por Love is too noble such deceits to use
  Referring me to heaven your gift I lose
  So princes cheaply may our wants supply
  When they give that their treasurers deny

  Ber Love blinds my virtueIf I longer stay
  It will grow dark and I shall lose my way

  Por One kiss from this fair hand can be no sin
  ask not that you gave to Maximin
  In full reward of all the pains Ive past
  Give me but one

  Ber Then let it be your last

  Por Tis gone
  Like soldiers prodigal of their arrears
  One minute spends the pay of many years
  Let but one more be added to the sum
  And pay at once for all my pains to come

  Ber Unthrifts will starve if we beforehand give
                                               Pulling back her hand
  Ill see you shall have just enough to live

Enter EROTION

  Ero Madam the emperor is drawing near
  And comes they say to seek Porphyrius here

  Ber Alas

  Por I will not ask what he intends
  My life or death alone on you depends

  Ber I must withdraw but must not let him know
                                                               Aside
  How hard the precepts of my virtue grow
  But whateer fortune is for me designed
  Sweet heaven be still to brave Porphyrius kind
                                                   Exit with EROTION

  Por Shes gone unkindly and refused to cast
  One glance to feed me for so long a fast

Enter MAXIMIN PLACIDIUS and guards

  Max Porphyrius since the Gods have ravished one
  I come in you to seek another son
  Succeed him then in my imperial states
  Succeed in all but his untimely fate
  If I adopt you with no better grace
  Pardon a fathers tears upon my face
  And give them to Charinus memory
  May they not prove as ominous to thee

  Por With what misfortunes heaven torments me still
  Why must I be obliged to one so ill
                                                               Aside

  Max Those offers which I made you sir were such
  No private man should need to balance much

  Por Who durst his thoughts to such ambition lift
                                                            Kneeling
  The greatness of it made me doubt the gift
  The distance was so vast that to my view
  It made the object seem at first untrue
  And now tis near the sudden excellence
  Strikes through and flashes on my tender sense

  Max Yet heaven and earth which so remote appear
                                                         Raising him
  Are by the air which flows betwixt them near
  And twixt us two my daughter be the chain
  One end with me and one with you remain

  Por You press me down with such a glorious fate
                                                      Kneeling again
  I cannot rise against the mighty weight
  Permit I may retire some little space
  And gather strength to bear so great a grace
                                                         Exit bowing

  Plac How love and fortune lavishly contend
  Which should Porphyrius wishes most befriend
  The midstreams his I creeping by the side
  Am shouldered off by his impetuous tide
                                                               Aside

Enter VALERIUS hastily

  Val I hope my business may my haste excuse
  For sir I bring you most surprising news
  The Christian princess in her tent confers
  With fifty of our learned philosophers
  Whom with such eloquence she does persuade
  That they are captives to her reasons made
  I left them yielding up their vanquished cause
  And all the soldiers shouting her applause
  Even Apollonius does but faintly speak
  Whose voice the murmurs of the assistants break

  Max Conduct this captive Christian to my tent
  She shall be brought to speedy punishment
  I must in time some remedy provide
                                                            Exit VAL
  Lest this contagious error spread too wide

  Plac To infected zeal you must no mercy shew
  For from religion all rebellions grow

  Max The silly crowd by factious teachers brought
  To think that faith untrue their youth was taught
  Run on in new opinions blindly bold
  Neglect contemn and then assault the old
  The infectious madness seizes every part
  And from the head distils upon the heart
  And first they think their princes faith not true
  And then proceed to offer him a new
  Which if refused all duty from them cast
  To their new faith they make new kings at last

  Plac Those ills by malcontents are often wrought
  That by their prince their duty may be bought
  They head those holy factions which they hate
  To sell their duty at a dearer rate
  But sir the tribune is already here
  With your fair captive

  Max Bid them both appear

Enter St CATHERINE VALERIUS APOLLONIUS and Guards

  See where she comes with that high air and mein
  Which marks in bonds the greatness of a queen
  What pity tisbut I no charms must see
  In her who to our gods is enemy
  Fair foe of heaven whence comes this haughty pride
                                                              To her
  Or is it frenzy does your mind misguide
  To scorn our worship and new gods to find

  S Cath Nor pride nor frenzy but a settled mind
  Enlightened from above my way does mark

  Max Though heaven be clear the way to it is dark

  S Cath But where our reason with our faith does go
  Were both above enlightened and below
  But reason with your fond religion fights
  For many gods are many infinites
  This to the first philosophers was known
  Who under various names adored but one
  Though your vain poets after did mistake
  Who every attribute a god did make
  And so obscene their ceremonies be
  As good men loath and Cato blushed to see

  Max War is my provincePriest why stand you mute
  You gain by heaven and therefore should dispute

  Apol In all religions as in ours there are
  Some solid truths and some things popular
  The popular in pleasing fables lie
  The truths in precepts of morality
  And these to human life are of that use
  That no religion can such rules produce

  S Cath Then let the whole dispute concluded be
  Betwixt these rules and christianity

  Apol And what more noble can your doctrine preach
  Than virtue which philosophy does teach
  To keep the passions in severest awe
  To live to reason natures greatest law
  To follow virtue as its own reward
  And good and ill as things without regard

  S Cath Yet few could follow those strict rules they gave
  For human life will human frailties have
  And love of virtue is but barren praise
  Airy as fame nor strong enough to raise
  The actions of the soul above the sense
  Virtue grows cold without a recompence
  We virtuous acts as duty do regard
  Yet are permitted to expect reward

  Apol By how much more your faith reward assures
  So much more frank our virtue is than yours

  S Cath Blind men you seek een those rewards you blame
  But ours are solid yours an empty name
  Either to open praise your acts you guide
  Or else reward yourselves with secret pride

  Apol Yet still our moral virtues you obey
  Ours are the precepts though applied your way

  S Cath Tis true your virtues are the same we teach
  But in our practice they much higher reach
  You but forbid to take anothers due
  But we forbid even to desire it too
  Revenge of injuries you virtue call
  But we forgiveness of our wrongs extol
  Immodest deeds you hinder to be wrought
  But we proscribe the least immodest thought
  So much your virtues are in ours refined
  That yours but reach the actions ours the mind

  Max Answer in short to what you heard her speak
                                                             To APOL

  Apol Where truth prevails all arguments are weak
  To that convincing power I must give place
  And with that truth that faith I will embrace

  Max O traitor to our godsbut more to me
  Darst thou of any faith but of thy princes be
  But sure thou ravst thy foolish error find
  Cast up the poison that infects thy mind
  And shun the torments thou art sure to feel

  Apol Nor fire nor torture nor revenging steel
  Can on my soul the least impression make
  How gladly truth I suffer for thy sake
  Once I was ignorant of what was so
  But never can abandon truth I know
  My martyrdom I to thy crown prefer
  Truth is a cause for a philosopher

  S Cath Lose not that courage which heaven does inspire
                                                             To APOL
  But fearless go to be baptised in fire
  Think tis a triumph not a danger near
  Give him your blood but give him not a tear
  Go and prepare my seat and hovering be
  Near that bright space which is reserved for me

  Max Hence with the traitor bear him to his fate

  Apol Tyrant I fear thy pity not thy hate
  A life eternal I by death obtain

  Max Go carry him where he that life may gain
                                      Exeunt APOL VAL and Guards

  Plac From this enchantress all these ills are come
  You are not safe till you pronounce her doom
  Each hour she lives a legion sweeps away
  Shell make your army martyrs in a day

  Max Tis just This Christian sorceress shall die
  Would I had never proved her sorcery
  Not that her charming tongue this change has bred
  I fear tis something that her eyes have said
  I love and am ashamed it should be seen
                                                               Aside

  Max Consider shes a queen

  Plac Those claims in Cleopatra ended were

  Max How many Cleopatras live in her
                                                                 Aside

  Plac When you condemned her sir she was a queen

  Max No slave she only was a captive then

  S Cath My joyful sentence you defer too long

  Max I never knew that life was such a wrong
  But if you needs will dieit shall be so
  Yet think it does from your perverseness flow
  Men say indeed that I in blood delight
  But you shall findhaste take her from my sight
  For Maximin I have too much confest
  And for a lover not enough exprest
  Absent I may her martyrdom decree
  But one look more will make that martyr me
                                        Exit St CATHARINE guarded

  Plac What is it sir that shakes your mighty mind

  Max Somewhat I am ashamed that thou shouldst find

  Plac If it be love which does your soul possess

  Max Are you my rival that so soon you guess

  Plac Far mighty prince be such a crime from me
                                                            Kneeling
  Which with the pride includes impiety
  Could you forgive it yet the gods above
  Would never pardon me a Christian love

  Max Thou liestTheres not a God inhabits there
  But for this Christian would all heaven forswear
  Even Jove would try more shapes her love to win      
  And in new birds and unknown beasts would sin      
  At least if Jove could love like Maximin            

  Plac A captive sir who would a martyr die

  Max She courts not death but shuns captivity
  Great gifts and greater promises Ill make
  And what religion ist but they can shake
  She shall live highDevotion in distress
  Is born but vanishes in happiness

  Plac Solus His son forgot his empress unappeased
  How soon the tyrant with new love is seized
  Love various minds does variously inspire
  He stirs in gentle natures gentle fire
  Like that of incense on the altars laid
  But raging flames tempestuous souls invade
  A fire which every windy passion blows
  With pride it mounts and with revenge it glows
  But I accursed who servilely must move
  And sooth his passion for his daughters love
  Small hope tis true attends my mighty care
  But of all passions love does last despair

ACT III


SCENE IThe Royal Pavilion

Enter MAXIMIN PLACIDIUS Guards and Attendants

  Max This love that never could my youth engage
  Peeps out his coward head to dare my age
  Where hast thou been thus long thou sleeping form
  That wakst like drowsy seamen in a storm
  A sullen hour thou chusest for thy birth
  My love shoots up in tempests as the earth
  Is stirred and loosened in a blustring wind
  Whose blasts to waiting flowers her womb unbind

  Plac Forgive me if I say your passions are
  So rough as if in love you would make war
  But love is soft
  And with soft beauty tenderly complies
  In lips it laughs and languishes in eyes

  Max There let it laugh or like an infant weep
  I cannot such a supple passion keep
  Mine stiff with age and stubborn as my arms
  Walks upright stoops not to but meets her charms

  Plac Yet fierceness suits not with her gentle kind
  They brave assaults but may be undermined

  Max Till I in those mean arts am better read
  Court thou and fawn and flatter in my stead

Enter St CATHARINE

  She comes and now methinks I could obey
  Her form glides through me and my heart gives way
  This iron heart which no impression took
  From wars melts down and runs if she but look
                                                        Exit MAXIMIN

  Plac Madam I from the emperor am come
  To applaud your virtue and reverse your doom
  He thinks whatever your religion be
  This palm is owing to your constancy

  S Cath My constancy from him seeks no renown
  Heaven that proposed the course will give the crown

  Plac But monarchs are the gods vicegerents here
  Heaven gives rewards but what it gives they bear
  From heaven to you the Egyptian crown is sent
  Yet tis a prince who does the gift present

  S Cath The deity I serve had he thought fit
  Could have preserved my crown unconquered yet
  But when his secret Providence designed
  To level that he levelled too my mind
  Which by contracting its desires is taught
  The humble quiet of possessing nought

  Plac To stoicks leave a happiness so mean
  Your virtue does deserve a nobler scene
  You are not for obscurity designed
  But like the sun must cheer all human kind

  S Cath No happiness can be where is no rest
  Th unknown untalked of man is only blest
  He as in some safe cliff his cell does keep
  From whence he views the labours of the deep
  The goldfraught vessel which mad tempests beat
  He sees now vainly make to his retreat
  And when from far the tenth wave does appear
  Shrinks up in silent joy that hes not there

  Plac You have a pilot who your ship secures
  The monarch both of earth and seas is yours
  He who so freely gives a crown away
  Yet asks no tribute but what you may pay
  One smile on him a greater wealth bestows
  Than Egypt yields when Nilus overflows

  S Cath I cannot wholly innocent appear
  Since I have lived such words as these to hear
  O heaven which dost of chastity take care

  Plac Why do you lose an unregarded prayer
  If happiness as you believe be rest
  That quiet sure is by the gods possest
  Tis greatness to neglect or not to know
  The little business of the world below

  S Cath This doctrine well befitted him who thought
  A casual world was from wild atoms wrought
  But such an order in each chance we see
  Chained to its cause as that to its decree
  That none can think a workmanship so rare
  Was built or kept without a workmans care

To them MAXIMIN Attendants and Guards

  Max Madam you from Placidius may have heard
  Some news which will your happiness regard
  For what a greater happiness can be
  Than to be courted and be loved by me
  The Egyptian crown I to your hands remit
  And with it take his heart who offers it
                                                     She turns aside
  Do you my person and my gift contemn

  S Cath My hopes pursue a brighter diadem

  Max Can any brighter than the Roman be
  I find my proffered love has cheapend me
  Since you neglect to answer my desires
  Know princess you shall burn in other fires
  Why should you urge me to so black a deed
  Think all my anger did from love proceed

  S Cath Nor threats nor promises my mind can move
  Your furious anger nor your impious love

  Max The love of you can never impious be
  You are so pure
  That in the act twould change the impiety
  Heaven would unmake it sin

  S Cath I take myself from that detested sight
  To my respect thou hast no longer right
  Such power in bonds true piety can have
  That I command and thou art but a slave
                                                       Exit St CATH


  Max To what a height of arrogance she swells
  Pride or illnature still with virtue dwells
  Her death shall set me free this very hour
  But is her death within a lovers power
  Wild with my rage more wild with my desire
  Like meeting tidesbut mine are tides of fire
  What petty promise wast that caused this frown

  Plac You heard No less than the Egyptian crown

  Max Throw Egypts by and offer in the stead
  Offerthe crown on Berenices head
  I am resolved to double till I win
  About it straight and send Porphyrius in
                                                           Exit PLAC
  We look like eagles towering in the sky
  While her high flight still raises mine more high

To him PORPHYRIUS

  Por I come sir to expect your great commands

  Max My happiness lies only in thy hands
  And since I have adopted thee my son
  Ill keep no secret from thy breast unknown
  Led by the interest of my rising fate
  I did espouse this empress whom I hate
  And therefore with less shame I may declare
  That I the fetters of thy captive wear

  Por Sir you amaze me with so strange a love

  Max Pity my son those flames you disapprove
  The cause of love can never be assigned
  Tis in no face but in the lovers mind

  Por Yet there are beauties which attract all hearts
  And all mankind lies open to their darts
  Whose sovereignty without dispute we grant
  Such graces sure your empress does not want

  Max Beauty has bounds
  And can no more to every heart be so
  Than any coin through every land can go
  Some secret grace which is but so to me
  Though not so great may yet more powerful be
  All guard themselves when stronger foes invade      
  Yet by the weak surprises may be made             
  But you my son are not to judge but aid          

  Por What is it sir you can require of me

  Max I would from Berenices bonds be free
  This yoke of marriage from us both remove
  Where two are bound to draw though neither love

  Por Neither the gods nor man will give consent
  To put in practice your unjust intent

  Max Both must consent to that which I decree

  Por The soldiers love her brothers memory
  And for her sake some mutiny will stir

  Max Our parting therefore shall be sought by her
  Go bid her sue for a divorce or die
  Ill cut the knot if she will not untie
  Haste to prepare her and thyself return
  Thy Hymens torch this day with mine shall burn
                                                                Exit

  Por Rather my funeraltorch for though I know
  Valerias fair and that she loves me too
  Gainst her my soul is armed on every part
  Yet there are secret rivets to my heart
  Where Berenices charms have found the way
  Subtle as lightnings but more fierce than they
  How shall I this avoid or gain that love
  So near the rock I to the port must move

To him VALERIA attended

  Val Porphyrius now my joy I may express
  Nor longer hide the love I must possess
  Should I have staid till marriage made us one
  You might have thought it was by duty done
  But of my heart I now a present make
  And give it you ere it be yours to take
  Accept it as when early fruit we send
  And let the rareness the small gift commend

  Por Great monarchs like your father often give
  What is above a subject to receive
  But faithful officers should countermand
  And stop the gift that passes through their hand
  And to their prince that mass of wealth restore
  Which lavished thus would make whole nations poor

  Val But to this gift a double right you have
  My father gives but what before I gave

  Por In vain you such unequal presents make
  Which I still want capacity to take
  Such fatal bounty once the Gauls did show
  They threw their rings but threw their targets too
  Bounty so placed does more like ruin look
  You pour the ocean on a narrow brook

  Val Yet if your love before prepares a boat
  The stream so poured drowns not but makes it float

  Por But when the vessel is on quicksands cast
  The flowing tide does more the sinking haste

  Val And on what quicksands can your heart be thrown
  Can you a love besides Valerias own

  Por If he who at your feet his heart would lay
  Be met with first and robbed upon the way
  You may indeed the robbers strength accuse
  But pardon him who did the present lose

  Val Who is this thief that does my right possess
  Name her and then we of her strength may guess
  From whence does your unwonted silence come

  Por She bound and gagged me and has left me dumb

  Val But of my wrongs I will aloud complain
  False man thou wouldst excuse thyself in vain
  For thee I did a maidens blush forsake
  And owned a love thou hast refused to take

  Por Refused itlike a miser midst his store
  Who grasps and grasps till he can hold no more
  And when his strength is wanting to his mind
  Looks back and sighs on what he left behind

  Val No I resume that heart thou didst possess
  My father shall my injuries redress
  With me thou losest his imperial crown
  And speedy death attends upon his frown

  Por You may revenge your wrongs a nobler way
  Command my death and I will soon obey

  Val No live for on thy life my cure depends
  In debtors deaths all obligation ends
  Twill be some ease ungrateful thee to call
  And bankruptlike say trusting him lost all

  Por Upbraided thus what generous man would live
  But fortune will revenge what you forgive
  When I refuse as in few hours I must
  This offered grace your father will be just

  Val Be just say rather he will cruel prove
  To kill that only person I can love
  Yet so it is
  Your interest in the army is so high
  That he must make you his or you must die
  It is resolved whoeer my rival be
                                                Aside after a pause
  Ill show that I deserve him more than she
  And if at last he does ungrateful prove
  My constancy itself rewards my love
                                                                Exit

  Por Shes gone and gazing round about I see
  Nothing but death or glorious misery
  Here empire stands if I could love displace
  There hopeless love with more imperial grace
  Thus as a sinking hero compassed round
  Beckons his bravest foe for his last wound
  And him into his part of fame does call
  Ill turn my face to love and there Ill fall

To him BERENICE and EROTION

  Ber I come Porphyrius to congratulate
  This happy change of your exalted fate
  You to the empire are I hear designed
  And fair Valeria must the alliance bind

  Por Would heaven had my succession so decreed
  That I in all might Maximin succeed
  He offers me the imperial crown tis true
  I would succeed him but it is in you

  Ber In me I never did accept your love
  But you I see would handsomely remove
  And I can give you leave without a frown
  I always thought you merited a crown

  Por I never sought that crown but on your brow
  But you with such indifference would allow
  My change that you have killed me with that breath
  I feel your scorn cold as the hand of death

  Ber Youll come to life in your Valerias arms
  Tis true I cannot boast of equal charms
  Or if I could I never did admit
  Your love to me but only suffered it
  I am a wife and can make no return
  And twere but vain in hopeless fires to burn

  Por Unkind can you whom only I adore
  Set open to your slave the prisondoor
  You use my heart just as you would afford
  A fatal freedom to some harmless bird
  Whom breeding you neer taught to seek its food
  And now let fly to perish in the wood

  Ber Then if you will love on and disobey
  And lose an empire for my sake you may
  Will a kind look from me pay all this score
  For you well know you must expect no more

  Por All I deserve it will not all I wish
  But I will brave the tyrants rage for this
  If I refuse my death must needs ensue
  But you shall see that I dare die for you

  Ber Would you for me
  A beauty and an empire too deny
  I love you now so wellthat you shall die
  Die mine tis all I can with honour give
  Nor should you die if after I would live
  But when your marriage and your death I view
  That makes you false but this will keep you true

  Por Unbind thy brows and look abroad to see
  O mighty love thy mightiest victory

  Ber And yetis there no other way to try
  Tis hard to say I love and let you die

  Por Yes there remains some help which you might give
  If you as I would die for love would live

  Ber If death for love be sweet sure life is more
  Teach me the means your safety to restore

  Por Your tyrant the Egyptian princess loves
  And to that height his swelling passion moves
  That fearing in your death the soldiers force
  He from your bed does study a divorce

  Ber The Egyptian princess I disputing heard
  And as a miracle her mind regard
  But yet I wish that this divorce be true
                                                      Gives her hand

  Por Tis madam but it must be sought by you
  By this he will all mutinies prevent
  And this as well secures your own content

  Ber I hate this tyrant and his bed I loath
  But once submitting I am tied to both
  Tied to that honour which all women owe
  Though not their husbands person yet their vow
  Something so sacred in that bond there is
  That none should think there could be aught amiss
  And if there be we should in silence hide
  Those faults which blame our choice when they are spied

  Por But since to all the world his crimes are known
  And by himself the civil wars begun
  Would you the advantage of the fight delay
  If striking first you were to win the day

  Ber I would like Jews upon their sabbath fall
  And rather than strike first not strike at all

  Por Against yourself you sadly prophecy
  You either this divorce must seek or die

  Ber Then death from all my griefs shall set me free

  Por And would you rather chuse your death than me

  Ber My earthly part
  Which is my tyrants right death will remove
  Ill come all soul and spirit to your love
  With silent steps Ill follow you all day
  Or else before you in the sun beams play
  Ill lead you thence to melancholy groves
  And there repeat the scenes of our past loves
  At night I will within your curtains peep
  With empty arms embrace you while you sleep
  In gentle dreams I often will be by
  And sweep along before your closing eye
  All dangers from your bed I will remove
  But guard it most from any future love
  And when at last in pity you will die
  Ill watch your birth of immortality
  Then turtlelike Ill to my mate repair
  And teach you your first flight in open air
                                         Exit BERENICE and ERATION

  Por She has but done what honour did require
  Nor can I blame that love which I admire
  But then her death
  Ill stand betwixt it first shall pierce my heart
  We will be stuck together on his dart
  But yet the danger not so high does grow
  Ill charge death first perhaps repulse him too
  But if oerpowered I must be overcome
  Forced back Ill fight each inch into my tomb
                                                                Exit




ACT IV


SCENE IAn Indian cave

Enter PLACIDIUS and NIGRINUS NIGRINUS with two drawn swords held
upward in his hands

  Plac All other means have failed to move her heart
  Our last resource is therefore to your art

  Nig Of wars and bloodshed and of dire events
  Of fates and fighting kings their instruments
  I could with greater certainty foretell
  Love only does in doubts and darkness dwell
  For like a wind it in no quarter stays
  But points and veers each hour a thousand ways
  On women love depends and they on will
  Chance turns their orb while destiny sits still

  Plac Leave nothing unattempted in your power
  Remember you oblige an emperor

  Nig An earthy fiend by compact me obeys
  But him to light intents I must not raise
  Some astral forms I must invoke by prayer
  Framed all of purest atoms of the air
  Not in their natures simply good or ill
  But most subservient to bad spirits will
  Nakar of these does lead the mighty band
  For eighty legions move at his command
  Gentle to all but far above the rest
  Mild Nakar loves his soft Damilcar best
  In airy chariots they together ride
  And sip the dew as through the clouds they glide
  These are the spirits which in love have power

  Plac Haste and invoke them in a happy hour

  Nig And so it proves For counting seven from noon
  Tis Venus hour and in the waxing moon
  With chalk I first describe a circle here
  Where these etherial spirits must appear
  Come in come in for here they will be strait
  Around around the place I fumigate
  My fumigation is to Venus just
  The souls of roses and red corals dust
  A lump of Sperma Ceti and to these
  The stalks and chips of Lignum Aloes
  And last to make my fumigation good
  Tis mixt with sparrows brains and pigeons blood
                                        NIGRINUS takes up the swords
  They come they come they come I hear them now

  Plac A deathlike damp sits cold upon my brow
  And misty vapours swim before my sight

  Nig They come not in a shape to cause your fright

NAKAR and DAMILCAR descend in clouds and sing

  Nakar Hark my Damilcar we are called below

  Dam Let us go let us go
  Go to relieve the care
  Of longing lovers in despair

  Nakar Merry merry merry we sail from the east
  Half tippled at a rainbow feast

  Dam In the bright moonshine while winds whistle loud
  Tivy tivy tivy we mount and we fly
  All racking along in a downy white cloud
  And lest our leap from the sky should prove too far
  We slide on the back of a newfalling star

  Nakar And drop from above
  In a jelly of love

  Dam But now the suns down and the elements red
  The spirits of fire against us make head

  Nakar They muster they muster like gnats in the air
  Alas I must leave thee my fair
  And to my light horsemen repair

  Dam O stay for you need not to fear them tonight
  The wind is for us and blows full in their sight
  And oer the wide ocean we fight
  Like leaves in the autumn our foes will fall down
  And hiss in the water

  Both And hiss in the water and drown

  Nakar But their men lie securely intrenched in a cloud
  And a trumpeterhornet to battle sounds loud

  Dam Now mortals that spy
  How we tilt in the sky
  With wonder will gaze
  And fear such events as will neer come to pass

  Nakar Stay you to perform what the men will have done

  Dam Then call me again when the battle is won

  Both So ready and quick is a spirit of air
  To pity the lover and succour the fair
  That silent and swift the little soft god
  Is here with a wish and is gone with a nod
                    The clouds part NAKAR flies up and DAMILCAR down

  Nig I charge thee spirit stay and by the power
                                                         To DAMILCAR
  Of Nakars love and of this holy wand
  On the north quarter of my circle stand
  Seven foot around for my defence I take
  To all my questions faithful answers make
  So mayest thou live thy thousand years in peace
  And see thy airy progeny increase
  So mayest thou still continue young and fair
  Fed by the blast of pure therial air
  And thy full term expired without all pain
  Dissolve into thy astral source again

  Dam Name not my hated rival Gemory
  And Ill speak true whateer thy questions be

  Nig Thy rivals hated name I will refrain
  Speak shall the emperor his love obtain

  Dam Few hours shall pass before your emperor shall be
  Possessed of that he loves or from that love be free

  Plac Shall I enjoy that beauty I adore

  Dam She suppliantlike ere long thy succour shall implore
  And thou with her thou lovest in happiness mayst live
  If she not dies before who all thy joys can give

  Nig Say what does the Egyptian princess now

  Dam A gentle slumber sits upon her brow

  Nig Go stand before her in a golden dream
  Set all the pleasures of the world to shew
  And in vain joys let her loose spirit flow

  Dam Twice fifty tents remove her from your sight
  But Ill cut through them all with rays of light
  And covering other objects to your eyes
  Shew where entranced in silent sleep she lies

DAMILCAR stamps and the bed arises with St CATHARINE in it

  DAMILCAR singing

    You pleasing dreams of love and sweet delight
    Appear before this slumbering virgins sight
    Soft visions set her free
    From mournful piety
    Let her sad thoughts from heaven retire
    And let the melancholy love
    Of those remoter joys above
    Give place to your more sprightly fire
    Let purling streams be in her fancy seen
    And flowery meads and vales of chearful green
    And in the midst of deathless groves
    Soft sighing wishes lie
    And smiling hopes fast by
    And just beyond them everlaughing loves

A SCENE of a Paradise is discovered

  Plac Some pleasing objects do her mind employ
  For on her face I read a wandering joy


  SONG

  Dam Ah how sweet it is to love
        Ah how gay is young desire
        And what pleasing pains we prove
        When we first approach loves fire
          Pains of love be sweeter far
          Than all other pleasures are

       Sighs which are from lovers blown
        Do but gently heave the heart
        Even the tears they shed alone
        Cure like trickling balm their smart
          Lovers when they lose their breath
          Bleed away in easy death

       Love and time with reverence use
        Treat them like a parting friend
        Nor the golden gifts refuse
        Which in youth sincere they send
          For each year their price is more
          And they less simple than before

       Love like springtides full and high
        Swells in every youthful vein
        But each tide does less supply
        Till they quite shrink in again
          If a flow in age appear
          Tis but rain and runs not clear

At the end of the Song a Dance of Spirits After which AMARIEL the
GuardianAngel of St CATHARINE descends to soft music with a flaming
sword The spirits crawl off the stage amazedly and DAMILCAR runs to
a corner of it

  Amar From the bright empire of eternal day
  Where waiting minds for heavens commission stay
  Amariel flies A darted mandate came
  From that great will which moves this mighty frame
  Bid me to thee my royal charge repair
  To guard thee from the dmons of the air
  My flaming sword above them to display
  All keen and ground upon the edge of day
  The flat to sweep the visions from thy mind
  The edge to cut them through that stay behind
  Vain spirits you that shunning heavens high noon
  Swarm here beneath the concave of the moon
  What folly or what rage your duty blinds
  To violate the sleep of holy minds
  Hence to the task assigned you here below
  Upon the ocean make loud tempests blow
  Into the wombs of hollow clouds repair
  And crush out thunder from the bladdered air
  From pointed sunbeams take the mists they drew
  And scatter them again in pearly dew
  And of the bigger drops they drain below
  Some mould in hail and others stamp in snow

  Dam Mercy bright spirit I already feel
  The piercing edge of thy immortal steel
  Thou prince of day from elements art free
  And I all body when compared to thee
  Thou treadst the abyss of light
  And where it streams with open eyes canst go
  We wander in the fields of air below
  Changelings and fools of heaven and thence shut out
  Wildly we roam in discontent about
  Gross heavyfed next man in ignorance and sin
  And spotted all without and dusky all within
  Without thy sword I perish by thy sight
  I reel and stagger and am drunk with light

  Amar If eer again thou on this place art found
  Full fifty years Ill chain thee under ground
  The damps of earth shall be thy daily food
  All swoln and bloated like a dungeon toad
  And when thou shalt be freed yet thou shalt lie
  Gasping upon the ground too faint to fly
  And lag below thy fellows in the sky

  Dam O pardon pardon this accursed deed
  And I no more on magic fumes will feed
  Which drew me hither by their powerful steams

  Amar Go expiate thy guilt in holy dreams
                                                            Exit DAM
  But thou sweet saint henceforth disturb no more
                                                          To S CATH
  With dreams not thine thy thoughts to heaven restore
                              The Angel ascends and the scene shuts

  Nig Some holy being does invade this place
  And from their duty does my spirits chase
  I dare no longer near it make abode
  No charms prevail against the Christians God
                                                                Exit

  Plac How doubtfully these spectres fate foretell
  In double sense and twilight truth they dwell
  Like fawning courtiers for success they wait
  And then come smiling and declare for fate

Enter MAXIMIN and PORPHYRIUS attended by VALERIUS and guards

  But see the tyrant and my rival come
  I like the fiends will flatter in his doom
  None but a fool distasteful truth will tell
  So it be new and please tis full as well
                  PLAC whispers with the Emperor who seems pleased

  Max You charm me with your news which Ill reward
  By hopes we are for coming joys prepared
  Possess her love or from that love be free
  Heaven speaks me fair If she as kind can prove
  I shall possess but never quit my love
  Go tell me when she wakes
                                                           Exit PLAC
                            PORPHYRIUS seems to beg something of him
  Porphyrius no
  She has refused and I will keep my vow

  Por For your own sake your cruel vow defer
  The times unsafe your enemies are near
  And to displease your men when they should fight

  Max My looks alone my enemies will fright
  And oer my men Ill set my careful spies
  To watch rebellion in their very eyes
  No more I cannot bear the least reply

  Por Yet tyrant thou shalt perish ere she die
                                                               Aside

Enter VALERIA

  Valeria here how fortune treats me still
  With various harms magnificently ill

  Max Valeria I was sending to your tent
                                                              To VAL
  But my commands your presence does prevent
  This is the hour wherein the priest shall join
  Your holy loves and make Porphyrius mine

  Val Now hold my heart and Venus I implore
  Be judge if she he loves deserves him more
                                                               Aside

  Por Past hope and all in vain I would preserve
  My life not for myself but her I serve
                                                               Aside

  Val I come great sir your justice to demand
                                                      To the Emperor

  Max You cannot doubt it from a fathers hand

  Por Sir I confess before her suit be known
  And by myself condemned my crime I own
  I have refused

  Val Peace peace while I confess
  I have refused thee for unworthiness

  Por I am amazed

  Max What riddles do you use
  Dare either of you my commands refuse

  Val Yes I dare own howeer twas wisely done
  To adopt so mean a person for your son
  So low you should not for your daughter chuse
  And therefore sir this marriage I refuse

  Max You liked the choice when first I thought it fit

  Val I had not then enough considered it

  Max And you have now considered it too much
  Secrets of empire are not safe to touch

  Por Let not your mighty anger rise too high
  Tis not Valeria merits it but I
  My own unworthiness so well I knew
  That from her love I consciously withdrew

  Val Thus rather than endure the little shame
  To be refused you blast a virgins name
  You to refuse and I to be denied
  Learn more discretion or be taught less pride

  Por O heaven in what a labyrinth am I led
  I could get out but she detains the thread
  Now must I wander on till I can see
  Whether her pity or revenge it be
                                                               Aside

  Max With what childs anger do you think you play
  Ill punish both if either disobey

  Val Since all the fault was mine I am content
  Porphyrius should not share the punishment

  Por Blind that I was till now that could not see
  Twas all the effect of generosity
  She loves me even to suffer for my sake
  And on herself would my refusal take
                                                               Aside

  Max Children to serve their parents intrest live
  Take heed what doom against yourself you give
                                                              To VAL

  Por Since she must suffer if I do not speak
  Tis time the laws of decency to break
  She told me sir that she your choice approved
  And though I blush to own it said she loved
  Loved me desertless who with shame confest
  Another flame had seized upon my breast
  Which when too late the generous princess knew
  And feared your justice would my crime pursue
  Upon herself she makes the tempest fall
  And my refusal her contempt would call

  Val He raves sir and to cover my disdain
  Unhandsomely would his denial feign
  And all means failing him at last would try
  To usurp the credit of a scorn and die
  But let him live His punishment shall be
  The grief his pride will bring for losing me

  Max You both obnoxious to my justice are
  And daughter you have not deserved my care
  Tis my command you strictly guarded be
  Till your fantastic quarrel you agree

  Por Sir

  Max Ill not hear you speak her crime is plain
  She owns her pride which you perhaps may feign
  She shall be prisoner till she bend her mind
  To that which is for both of you designed

  Val Youll find it hard my freeborn will to bound

  Max Ill find that power oer wills which heaven neer found
  Freewills a cheat in any one but me
  In all but kings tis willing slavery
  An unseen fate which forces the desire
  The will of puppets danced upon a wire
  A monarch is
  The spirit of the world in every mind
  He may match wolves to lambs and make it kind
  Mine is the business of your little fates
  And though you war like petty wrangling states
  Youre in my hand and when I bid you cease
  You shall be crushed together into peace

  Val Thus by the world my courage will be prized
                                                               Aside
  Seeming to scorn who am alas despised
  Dying for loves fulfilling honours laws
  A secret martyr while I own no cause
                                                            Exit VAL

  Max Porphyrius stay theres some thing I would hear
  You said you loved and you must tell me where

  Por All heaven is to my sole destruction bent
                                                               Aside

  Max You would it seems have leisure to invent

  Por Her name in pity sir I must forbear
  Lest my offences you revenge on her

  Max My promise for her life I do engage

  Por Will that sir be remembered in your rage

  Max Speak or your silence more my rage will move
  Twill argue that you rival me in love

  Por Can you believe that my ambitious flame
  Should mount so high as Berenices name

  Max Your guilt dares not approach what it would hide
  But draws me off and lapwinglike flies wide
  Tis not my wife but mistress you adore
  Though that affront yet this offends me more
  Who courts my wife
  Does to my honour more injurious prove
  But he who courts my mistress wrongs my love

  Por The Egyptian princess neer could move my heart

  Max You could not perish by a nobler dart

  Por Sir I presume not beauties to compare
  But in my eyes my princess is as fair

  Max Your princess then it seems though you deny
  Her name you love you own her quality

  Por Though not by birth or title so yet she
  Who rules my heart a princess is to me

  Max No no
  Tis plain that word you unawares did use
  And told a truth which now you would excuse
  Besides my wife and mistress here are none
  Who can the title of a princess own

  Por There is one more
  Your daughter sir Let that your doubt remove

  Max But she is not that princess whom you love

  Por I named not love though it might doubtful seem
  Shes fair and is that princess I esteem

  Max Go and to passion your esteem improve
  While I command her to receive your love
                                                            Exit POR

Enter ST CATHARINE

  S Cath I come not now as captive to your power
  To beg but as high heavens ambassador
  The laws of my religion to fulfil
  Heaven sends me to return you good for ill
  Your empress to your love I would restore
  And to your mind the peace it had before

  Max While in anothers name you peace declare
  Princess you in your own proclaim a war
  Your too great power does your design oppose
  You make those breaches which you strive to close

  S Cath That little beauty which too much you prize
  Seeks not to move your heart or draw your eyes
  Your love to Berenice is due alone
  Love like that power which I adore is one
  When fixed to one it safe at anchor rides
  And dares the fury of the winds and tides
  But losing once that hold to the wide ocean borne
  It drives away at will to every wave a scorn

  Max If to new persons I my love apply
  The stars and nature are in fault not I
  My loves are like my old prtorian bands
  Whose arbitrary power their prince commands
  I can no more make passion come or go
  Than you can bid your Nilus ebb or flow
  Tis lawless and will love and where it list
  And thats no sin which no man can resist
  Those who impute it to me as a crime
  Would make a god of me before my time

  S Cath A god indeed after the Roman stile
  An eagle mounting from a kindled pile
  But you may make yourself a god below
  For kings who rule their own desires are so
  You roam about and never are at rest
  By new desires that is new torments still possest
  Qualmish and loathing all you had before
  Yet with a sickly appetite to more
  As in a feverish dream you still drink on
  And wonder why your thirst is never gone
  Love like a ghostly vision haunts your mind
  Tis still before you what you left behind

  Max How can I help those faults which nature made
  My appetite is sickly and decayed
  And you forbid me change the sick mans ease
  Who cannot cure must humour his disease

  S Cath Your mind should first the remedy begin
  You seek without the cure that is within
  The vain experiments you make each day
  To find content still finding it decay
  Without attempting more should let you see
  That you have sought it where it neer could be
  But when you place your joys on things above
  You fix the wandering planet of your love
  Thence you may see
  Poor human kind all dazed in open day
  Err after bliss and blindly miss their way
  The greatest happiness a prince can know
  Is to love heaven above do good below

To them BERENICE and Attendants

  Ber That happiness may Berenice find
  Leaving these empty joys of earth behind
  And this frail being where so short a while
  The unfortunate lament and prosperous smile
  Yet a few days and those which now appear
  In youth and beauty like the blooming year
  In lifes swift scene shall change and cares shall come
  And heavy age and deaths relentless doom

  S Cath Yet man by pleasures seeks that fate which he would shun
  And sucked in by the stream does to the whirlpool run

  Max How madam are you to new ways inclined
  I fear the Christian sect perverts your mind
                                                              To BER

  Ber Yes tyrant know that I their faith embrace
  And own it in the midst of my disgrace
  That faith which abject as it seems to thee
  Is nobler than thy purple pageantry
  A faith which still with nature is at strife
  And looks beyond it to a future life
  A faith which vicious souls abhor and fear
  Because it shows eternity too near
  And therefore every one
  With seeming scorn of it the rest deceives
  All joining not to own what each believes

  S Cath O happy queen whom power leads not astray
  Nor youths more powerful blandishments betray

  Ber Your arguments my reason first inclined
  And then your bright example fixed my mind

  Max With what a holy empress am I blest
  What scorn of earth dwells in her heavenly breast
  My crowns too mean but He whom you adore
  Has one more bright of martyrdom in store
  She dies and I am from the envy freed
                                                               Aside
  She has I thank her her own death decreed
  No soldier now will in her rescue stir
  Her death is but in complaisance to her
  Ill haste to gratify her holy will
  Heaven grant her zeal may but continue still
  Tribune a guard to seize the empress strait
                                                              To VAL
  Secure her person prisoner to the state

  Val going to her Madam believe tis with regret I come
  To execute my angry princes doom

Enter PORPHYRIUS

  Por What is it I behold Tribune from whence
  Proceeds this more than barbarous insolence

  Val Sir I perform the emperors commands

  Por Villain hold off thy sacrilegious hands
  Or by the godsretire without reply
  And if he asks who bid thee say twas I
                                          VAL retires to a distance

  Ber Too generously your safety you expose
  To save one moment her whom you must lose

  Por Twixt you and death ten thousand lives there stand
  Have courage madam the prtorian band
  Will all oppose your tyrants cruelty

  S Cath And I have heaven implored she may not die
  As some to witness truth heavens call obey
  So some on earth must to confirm it stay

  Por What faith what witness is it that you name

  Ber Knowing what she believes my faiths the same

  Por How am I crossed what way soeer I go
  To the unlucky every thing is so
  Now fortune thou hast shown thy utmost spite
  The soldiers will not for a Christian fight
  And madam all that I can promise now
  Is but to die before death reaches you

  Ber Now death draws near a strange perplexity
  Creeps coldly on me like a fear to die
  Courage uncertain dangers may abate
  But who can bear the approach of certain fate

  S Cath The wisest and the best some fear may show
  And wish to stay though they resolve to go

  Ber As some faint pilgrim standing on the shore
  First views the torrent he would venture oer
  And then his inn upon the farther ground
  Loth to wade through and lother to go round
  Then dipping in his staff does trial make
  How deep it is and sighing pulls it back
  Sometimes resolved to fetch his leap and then
  Runs to the bank but there stops short again
  So I at once
  Both heavenly faith and human fear obey
  And feel before me in an unknown way
  For this blest voyage I with joy prepare
  Yet am ashamed to be a stranger there

  S Cath You are not yet enough prepared to die
  Earth hangs too heavy for your soul to fly

  Por One way and heaven I hope inspires my mind
  I for your safety in this strait can find
  But this fair queen must further my intent

  S Cath Name any way your reason can invent

  Por to Ber Though your religion which I cannot blame
  Because my secret soul avows the same
  Has made your life a forfeit to the laws
  The tyrants newborn passion is the cause
  Were this bright princess once removed away
  Wanting the food the flame would soon decay
  And Ill prepare a faithful guard this night
  To attend her person and secure her flight

  Ber to S Cath By this way I shall both from death be freed
  And you unforced to any wicked deed

  S Cath Madam my thoughts are with themselves at strife
  And heaven can witness how I prize your life
  But tis a doubtful conflict I must try
  Betwixt my pity and my piety
  Staying your precious life I must expose
  Going my crown of martyrdom I lose

  Por Your equal choice when heaven does thus divide
  You should like heaven still lean on mercys side

  S Cath The will of heaven judged by a private breast
  Is often whats our private interest
  And therefore those who would that will obey
  Without their interest must their duty weigh
  As for myself I do not life despise
  But as the greatest gift of nature prize
  My sex is weak my fears of death are strong
  And whateer is its being would prolong
  Were there no sting in death for me to die
  Would not be conquest but stupidity
  But if vain honour can confirm the soul
  And sense of shame the fear of death controul
  How much more then should faith uphold the mind
  Which showing death shows future life behind

  Ber Of deaths contempt heroic proofs you give
  But madam let my weaker virtue live
  Your faith may bid you your own life resign
  But not when yours must be involved with mine
  Since then you do not think me fit to die
  Ah how can you that life I beg deny

  S Cath Heaven does in this my greatest trial make
  When I for it the care of you forsake
  But I am placed as on a theatre
  Where all my acts to all mankind appear
  To imitate my constancy or fear
  Then madam judge what course I should pursue
  When I must either heaven forsake or you

  Por Were saving Berenices life a sin
  Heaven had shut up your flight from Maximin

  S Cath Thus with short plummets heavens deep will we sound
  That vast abyss where human wit is drowned
  In our small skiff we must not launch too far
  We here but coasters not discoverers are
  Faiths necessary rules are plain and few
  We many and those needless rules pursue
  Faith from our hearts into our heads we drive
  And make religion all contemplative
  You on heavens will may witty glosses feign
  But that which I must practise here is plain
  If the Allgreat decree her life to spare
  He will the means without my crime prepare
                                                        Exit St CATH

  Por Yet there is one way left it is decreed
  To save your life that Maximin shall bleed
  Midst all his guards I will his death pursue
  Or fall a sacrifice to love and you

  Ber So great a fear of death I have not shown
  That I would shed his blood to save my own
  My fear is but from human frailty brought
  And never mingled with a wicked thought

  Por Tis not a crime since one of you must die
  Or is excused by the necessity

  Ber I cannot to a husbands death consent
  But by revealing will your crime prevent
  The horror of this deed
  Against the fear of death has armed my mind
  And now less guilt in him than you I find
  If I a tyrant did detest before
  I hate a rebel and a traitor more
  Ungrateful man
  Remember whose successor thou art made
  And then thy benefactors life invade
  Guards to your charge I give your prisoner back
  And will from none but heaven my safety take
                                     Exit with VALERIUS and Guards

  Por Solus Tis true what she has often urged before
  Hes both my father and my emperor
  O honour how canst thou invent a way
  To save my queen and not my trust betray
  Unhappy I that eer he trusted me
  As well his guardianangel may his murderer be
  And yetlet honour faith and virtue fly
  But let not love in Berenice die
  She lives
  Thats put beyond dispute as firm as fate
  Honour and faith let argument debate

Enter MAXIMIN and VALERIUS talking and Guards

  Max Tis said but I am loth to think it true
                                                              To POR
  That my late orders were contemned by you
  That Berenice from her guards you freed

  Por I did it and I glory in the deed

  Max How glory my commands to disobey

  Por When those commands would your renown betray

  Max Who should be judge of that renown you name
  But I

  Por Yes I and all who love your fame

  Max Porphyrius your replies are insolent

  Por Sir they are just and for your service meant
  If for religion you our lives will take
  You do not the offenders find but make
  All faiths are to their own believers just
  For none believe because they will but must
  Faith is a force from which theres no defence
  Because the reason it does first convince
  And reason conscience into fetters brings
  And conscience is without the power of kings

  Max Then conscience is a greater prince than I
  At whose each erring call a king may die
  Who conscience leaves to its own free command
  Puts the worst weapon in a rebels hand

  Por Its empire therefore sir should bounded be
  And but in acts of its religion free
  Those who ask civil power and conscience too
  Their monarch to his own destruction woo
  With needful arms let him secure his peace
  Then that wild beast he safely may release

  Max I can forgive these liberties you take
  While but my counsellor yourself you make
  But you first act your sense and then advise
  That is at my expence you will be wise
  My wife I for religion do not kill
  But she shall diebecause it is my will

  Por Sir I acknowledge I too much have done
  And therefore merit not to be your son
  I render back the honours which you gave
  My libertys the only gift I crave

  Max You take too muchbut ere you lay it down
  Consider what you part with in a crown
  Monarchs of cares in policy complain
  Because they would be pitied while they reign
  For still the greater troubles they confess
  They know their pleasures will be envied less

  Por Those joys I neither envy nor admire
  But beg I from the troubles may retire

  Max What soul is this which empire cannot stir
  Supine and tame as a philosopher
  Know then thou wert adopted to a throne
  Not for thy sake so much as for my own
  My thoughts were once about thy death at strife
  And thy successions thy reprieve for life

  Por My life and death are still within your power
  But your succession I renounce this hour
  Upon a bloody throne I will not sit
  Nor share the guilt of crimes which you commit

  Max If you are not my Csar you must die

  Por I take it as the nobler destiny

  Max I pity thee and would thy faults forgive
  But thus presuming on thou canst not live

  Por Sir with your throne your pity I restore
  I am your foe nor will I use it more
  Now all my debts of gratitude are paid
  I cannot trusted be nor you betrayed
                                                            Is going

  Max Stay stay in threatening me to be my foe
  You give me warning to conclude you so
  Thou to succeed a monarch in his seat

Enter PLACIDIUS

  No fool thou art too honest to be great
  Placidius on your life this prisoner keep
  Our enmity shall end before I sleep

  Plac I still am ready sir wheneer you please
                                                              To POR
  To do you such small services as these

  Max The sight with which my eyes shall first be fed
  Must be my empress and this traitors head

  Por Whereer thou standst Ill level at that place
  My gushing blood and spout it at thy face
  Thus not by marriage we our blood will join
  Nay more my arms shall throw my head at thine
                                                        Exit guarded

  Max There go adoption I have now decreed
  That Maximin shall Maximin succeed
  Old as I am in pleasures I will try
  To waste an empire yet before I die
  Since life is fugitive and will not stay
  Ill make it fly more pleasantly away
                                                                Exit




ACT V SCENE I


Enter VALERIA and PLACIDIUS

  Val If as you say you silently have been
  So long my lover let my power be seen
  One hours discourse before Porphyrius die
  Is all I ask and you too may be by

  Plac I must not break
  The order which the emperor did sign

  Val Has then his hand more power with you than mine

  Plac This hand if given would far more powerful be
  Than all the monarchs of the world to me
  But tis a bait which would my heart betray
  And when Im fast will soon be snatched away

  Val O say not so for I shall ever be
  Obliged to him who once obliges me

  Plac Madam Ill wink and favour the deceit
  But know fair cozener that I know the cheat
  Though to these eyes I nothing can refuse
  Ill not the merit of my ruin lose
  It is enough I see the hook and bite
  But first Ill pay my death with my delight
                                           Kisses her hand and exit

  Val What can I hope from this sad interview
  And yet my brave design I will pursue
  By many signs I have my rival found
  But fortune him as deep as me does wound
  For if he loves the empress his sad fate
  More moves my pity than his scorn my hate

To her PLACIDIUS with PORPHYRIUS

  Plac I am perhaps the first
  Who forced by fate and in his own despite
  Brought a loved rival to his mistress sight

  Val But in revenge let this your comfort be
  That you have brought a man who loves not me
  However lay your causeless envy by
  He is a rival who must quickly die

  Por And yet I could with less concernment bear
  That death of which you speak than see you here
  So much of guilt in my refusal lies
  That debtorlike I dare not meet your eyes

  Val I do not blame you if you love elsewhere
  And would to heaven I could your sufferings bear
  Or once again could some new way invent
  To take upon myself your punishment
  I sent for you to let you know that still
  Though now I want the power I have the will

  Plac Can all this ocean of your kindness be
  Poured upon him and not one drop on me

  Val Tis poured but falls from this ungrateful man
  Like drops of water from a rising swan
  Upon his breast no sign of wet remains
  He bears his love more proudly than his chains

  Por This thankless man his death will soon remove
  And quickly end so undeserved a love

  Val Unthankful as you are I know not why
  But still I love too well to see you die
  Placidius can you love and see my grief
  And for my sake not offer some relief

  Plac Not all the gods his ruin shall prevent
  Your kindness does but urge his punishment
  Besides what can I for his safety do
  He has declared himself your fathers foe

  Val Give out he has escaped and set him free
  And if you please lay all the fault on me

  Por O do not on those terms my freedom name
  Freed by your danger I should die with shame

  Plac I must not farther by your prayers be won
  All I could do I have already done
                                                              To her

  Val To bring Porphyrius only to my sight
  Was not to show your pity but your spite
  Would you but half oblige her you adore
  You should not have done this or should do more

  Plac Alas what hope can there be left for me
  When I must sink into the mine I see
  My heart will fall before you if I stay
  Each word you speak saps part of it away
  Yet all my fortune on his death is set
  And he may love her though he loves not yet
  He mustand yet she says he must not die
  O if I could but wink I could deny

To them ALBINUS

  Alb The emperor expects your prisoner strait
  And with impatience for his death does wait

  Plac Nay then it is too late my love to weigh
  Your pardon madam if I must obey
                                                        Exit ALBINUS

  Por I am prepared he shall not long attend

  Val Then here my prayers and my submissions end
  Placidius know that hour in which he dies
  My death so well I love shall wait on his

  Plac O madam do not fright me with your death

  Val My life depends alone upon his breath
  But if I live in him you do not know
  How far my gratitude to you may go
  I do not promisebut it so may prove
  That gratitude in time may turn to love
  Try me

  Plac Now I consider it I will
                                                     Musing a little
  Tis in your power to save him or to kill
  Ill run the hazard to preserve his life
  If after that you vow to be my wife

  Val Nay good Placidius now you are too hard
  Would you do nothing but for mere reward
  Like usurers to men in want you prove
  When you would take extortion for my love

  Plac You have concluded then that he must die
                                               Going with PORPHYRIUS

  Val O stay if no price else his life can buy
  My love a ransom for his life I give
  Let my Porphyrius for another live
                            Holding her handkerchief before her face

  Por You too much value the small merchandise
  My lifes oerrated when your loves the price

Enter ALBINUS

  Alb I long have listened to your generous strife
  As much concerned for brave Porphyrius life
  For mine I to his favour owed this day
  Which with my future service I will pay

  Plac Lest any your intended flight prevent
  Ill lead you first the backway to my tent
  Thence in disguise you may the city gain
  While some excuse for your escape I feign

  Val Farewell I must not see you when you part
                                               Turning her face away
  For that last look would break my tender heart
  Yetlet it breakI must have one look more
                                                      Looking on him
  Nay now Im less contented than before
  For that last look draws on another too
  Which sure I need not to remember you
  For everyet I must one glance repeat
  But quick and short as starving people eat
  So much humanity dwell in your breast
  Sometimes to think on her who loves you best
                              Goinghe takes her hand and kisses it

  Por My wandering steps wherever fortune bear
  Your memory I in my breast will wear
  Which as a precious amulet I still
  Will carry my defence and guard from ill
  Though to my former vows I must be true
  Ill ever keep one love entire for you
  That love which brothers with chaste sisters make
  And by this holy kiss which now I take
  From your fair hand
  This common sun which absent both shall see
  Shall neer behold a breach of faith in me

  Val Go go my death will your short vows restore
  Youve said enough and I can hear no more
                Exeunt VAL one way and POR and ALB another

  Plac Love and good nature how do you betray
  Misleading those who see and know their way
  I whom deep arts of state could neer beguile
  Have sold myself to ruin for a smile
  Nay I am driven so low that I must take
  That smile as alms given for my rivals sake

Enter MAXIMIN talking with VALERIUS

  Max And why was I not told of this before

  Val Sir she this evening landed on the shore
  For with her daughter being prisoner made
  She in another vessel was conveyed

  Max Bring hither the Egyptian princess strait
                                                             To PLAC
  And you Valerius on her mother wait
                                                            Exit VAL

  Plac The mother of the Egyptian princess here

  Max Porphyrius death I will a while defer
  And this new opportunity improve
  To make my last effort upon her love
                                                           Exit PLAC
  Those who have youth may long endure to court
  But he must swiftly catch whose race is short
  I in my autumn do my siege begin
  And must make haste ere winter comes to win
  This hourno longer shall my pains endure
  Her love shall ease me or her death shall cure

Enter at one door FELICIA and VALERIUS at the other St CATHARINE
and PLACIDIUS

  S Cath O my dear mother

  Fel With what joy I see
  My dearest daughter from the tempest free

  S Cath Dearer than all the joys vain empire yields
  Or than to youthful monarchs conquered fields
  Before you camemy soul
  All filled with heaven did earthly joys disdain
  But you pull back some part of me again

  Plac You see sir she can own a joy below

  Max It much imports me that this truth I know

  Fel How dreadful death does on the waves appear
  Where seas we only see and tempests hear
  Such frightful images did then pursue
  My trembling soul that scarce I thought of you

  Plac All circumstances to your wish combine
  Her fear of death advances your design
                                                              To MAX

  Fel But to that only power we serve I prayed
  Till He who bid it rise the tempest laid

  Max You are a Christian then
                                                          To FELICIA
  For death this very hour you must prepare
  I have decreed no Christians life to spare

  Fel For death I hope you but my courage try
  Whatever I believe I dare not die
  Heaven does not sure that seal of faith require
  Or if it did would firmer thoughts inspire
  A womans witness can no credit give
  To truths divine and therefore I would live

  Max I cannot give the life which you demand
  But that and mine are in your daughters hand
  Ask her if she will yet her love deny
  And bid a monarch and her mother die

  Fel Now mighty prince you cancel all my fear
  My life is safe when it depends on her
  How can you let me languish thus in pain
                                                          To St CATH
  Make haste to cure those doubts which yet remain
  Speak quickly speak and ease me of my fear

  S Cath Alas I doubt it is not you I hear
  Some wicked fiend assumes your voice and face
  To make frail nature triumph over grace
  It cannot be
  That she who taught my childhood piety
  Should bid my riper age my faith deny
  That she who bid my hopes this crown pursue
  Should snatch it from me when tis just in view

  Fel Peace peace too much my ages shame you show
  How easy tis to teach how hard to do
  My labouring thoughts are with themselves at strife
  I dare not die nor bid you save my life

  Max You must do one and that without delay
  Too long already for your death I stay
  I cannot with your small concerns dispense
  For deaths of more importance call me hence
  Prepare to execute your office strait
                                                       To his Guards

  Fel O stay and let them but one minute wait
  Such quick commands for death you would not give
  If you but knew how sweet it were to live

  Max Then bid her love

  Fel Is duty grown so weak
                                                     To St CATHARINE
  That loves a harder word than death to speak

  S Cath Oh

  Fel Mistake me not I never can approve
  A thing so wicked as the tyrants love
  I ask you would but some false promise give
  Only to gain me so much time to live
                                           Privately to St CATHARINE

  S Cath That promise is a step to greater sin
  The hold once lost we seldom take again
  Each bound to heaven we fainter essays make
  Still losing somewhat till we quite go back

  Max Away I grant no longer a reprieve

  Fel O do but beg my life and I may live
                                                          To St CATH
  Have you not so much pity in your breast
  He stays to have you make it your request

  S Cath To beg your life
  Is not to ask a grace of Maximin
  It is a silent bargain for a sin
  Could we live always life were worth our cost
  But now we keep with care what must be lost
  Here we stand shivering on the bank and cry
  When we should plunge into eternity
  One moment ends our pain
  And yet the shock of death we dare not stand
  By thought scarce measured and too swift for sand
  Tis but because the living death neer knew
  They fear to prove it as a thing thats new
  Let me the experiment before you try
  Ill show you first how easy tis to die

  Max Draw then that curtain and let death appear
  And let both see how easy twill be there

The SCENE opens and shews the Wheel

  Fel Alas what torments I already feel

  Max Go bind her hand and foot beneath that wheel
  Four of you turn the dreadful engine round
  Four others hold her fastened to the ground
  That by degrees her tender breasts may feel
  First the rough razings of the pointed steel
  Her paps then let the bearded tenters stake
  And on each hook a gory gobbet take
  Till the upper flesh by piecemeal torn away
  Her beating heart shall to the sun display

  Fel My dearest daughter at your feet I fall
                                                            Kneeling
  Hear oh yet hear your wretched mothers call
  Think at your birth ah think what pains I bore
  And can your eyes behold me suffer more
  You were the child which from your infancy
  I still loved best and then you best loved me
  About my neck your little arms you spread
  Nor could you sleep without me in the bed
  But sought my bosom when you went to rest
  And all night long would lie across my breast
  Nor without cause did you that fondness show
  You may remember when our Nile did flow
  While on the bank you innocently stood
  And with a wand made circles in the flood
  That rose and just was hurrying you to death
  When I from far all pale and out of breath
  Ran and rushed in
  And from the waves my floating pledge did bear
  So much my love was stronger than my fear
  But you

  Max Woman for these long tales your lifes too short
  Go bind her quickly and begin the sport

  Fel No in her arms my sanctuarys placed
  Thus I will cling for ever to her waist
                                             Running to her daughter

  Max What must my will by women be controuled
  Haste draw your weapons and cut off her hold

  S Cath Thus my last duty to you let me pay
                                                  Kissing her mother
  Yet tyrant I to thee will never pray
  Tho hers to save I my own life would give
  Yet by my sin my mother shall not live
  To thy foul lust I never can consent
  Why dost thou then defer my punishment
  I scorn those Gods thou vainly dost adore
  Contemn thy empire but thy bed abhor
  If thou wouldst yet a bloodier tyrant be
  I will instruct thy rage begin with me

  Max I thank thee that thou dost my anger move
  It is a tempest that will wreck my love
  Ill pull thee hence close hidden as thou art
                                          Claps his hand to his breast
  And stand with my drawn sword before my heart
  Yes you shall be obeyed though I am loth
  Go and while I can bid you bind them both
  Go bind them ere my fit of love return
  Fire shall quench fire and anger love shall burn
  Thus I prevent those follies I should do
  And tis the nobler fever of the two

  Fel Torn piece by piece alas what horrid pains

  S Cath Heaven is all mercy who that death ordains
  And that which heaven thinks best is surely so
  But bare and naked shame to undergo
  Tis somewhat more than death
  Exposed to lawless eyes I dare not be
  My modesty is sacred heaven to thee
  Let not my body be the tyrants spoil
  Nor hands nor eyes thy purity defile
                       AMERIEL descends swiftly with a flaming sword
                       and strikes at the Wheel which breaks in pieces
                       then he ascends again

  Max Is this the effect of all your boasted skill
  These brittle toys to execute my will
  A puppetshew of death I only find
  Where I a strong and sinewy pain designed
  By what weak infant was this engine wrought

  Val From Bilbilis the tempered steel was brought
  Metal more tough the anvil neer did beat
  Nor from the forge did hissing waters heat

  Plac I saw a youth descend all heavenly fair
  Who in his hand a flaming sword did bear
  And whirlwindlike around him drove the air
  At his raised arm the rigid iron shook
  And bending backwards fled before the stroke

  Max What miracles the tricks of heaven to me
  Ill try if she be wholly iron free
  If not by sword then she shall die by fire
  And one by one her miracles Ill tire
  If proof against all kind of death she be
  My loves immortal and shes fit for me

  S Cath No heaven has shewn its power and now thinks fit
  Thee to thy former fury to remit
  Had providence my longer life decreed
  Thou from thy passion hadst not yet been freed
  But heaven which suffered that my faith to prove
  Now to itself does vindicate my love
  A power controuls thee which thou dost not see
  And thats a miracle it works in thee

  Max The truth of this new miracle well try
  To prove it you must take the pains to die
  Bring me their heads

  Fel That mercy tyrant thou denyst to me
  At thy last breath may heaven refuse to thee
  My fears are going and I death can view
  I see I see him there thy steps pursue
  And with a lifted arm and silent pace
  Stalk after thee just aiming in his chace

  S Cath No more dear mother ill in death it shews
  Your peace of mind by rage to discompose
  No streak of blood the relics of the earth
  Shall stain my soul in her immortal birth
  But she shall mount all pure a white and virgin mind
  And full of all that peace which there she goes to find
                  Exeunt St CATHARINE and FELICIA with VALERIUS
                   and guards The scene shuts

  Max Shes gone and pulled my heartstrings as she went
  Were penitence no shame I could repent
  Yet tis of bad example she should live
  For I might get the ill habit to forgive
  Thou soft seducer of my heart away
  Who lingring wouldst about its confines stay
  To watch when some rebellion would begin
  And ready at each sigh to enter in
  In vain for thou
  Dost on the outside of the body play
  And when drawn nearest shalt be whirld away
  What ails me that I cannot lose thy thought
  Command the empress hither to be brought
                                                             To PLAC
  I in her death shall some diversion find
  And rid my thoughts at once of womankind

  Plac Tis well he thinks not of Porphyrius yet
                                                         Aside Exit

  Max How hard it is this beauty to forget
  My stormy rage has only shook my will
  She crept down lower but she sticks there still
  Fool that I am to struggle thus with love
  Why should I that which pleases me remove
  True she should die were she concerned alone
  But I love not for her sake but my own
  Our Gods are Gods cause they have power and will
  Who can do all things can do nothing ill
  Ill is rebellion gainst some higher power
  The world may sin but not its emperor
  My empress then shall die my princess live
  If this be sin I do myself forgive

To him VALERIUS

  Val Your wills obeyed for mighty emperor
  The princess and her mother are no more

  Max She is not dead

  Val Great sir your will was so

  Max That was my will of half an hour ago
  But now tis altered I have changed her fate
  She shall not die

  Val Your pity comes too late
  Betwixt her guards she seemed by bridemen led
  Her checks with chearful blushes were oerspread
  When smiling to the axe she bowed her head
  Just at the stroke
  therial music did her death prepare
  Like joyful sounds of spousals in the air
  A radiant light did her crownd temples gild
  And all the place with fragrant scents was filled
  The balmy mist came thickening to the ground
  And sacred silence covered all around
  But when its work performed the cloud withdrew
  And day restored us to each others view
  I sought her head to bring it on my spear
  In vain I sought it for it was not there
  No part remained but from afar our sight
  Discovered in the air long tracts of light
  Of charming notes we heard the last rebounds
  And music dying in remoter sounds

  Max And dost thou think
  This lame account fit for a lovesick king
  Go from the other world a better bring
          Kills him then sets his foot on him and speaks on
  When in my breast two mighty passions strove
  Thou hadst erred better in obeying love
  Tis true that way thy death had followed too
  But I had then been less displeased than now
  Now I must live unquiet for thy sake
  And this poor recompence is all I take
                                                     Spurns the body

Here the Scene opens and discovers BERENICE on a scaffold the
guards by her and amongst them PORPHYRIUS and ALBINUS like Moors
as all the guards are PLACIDIUS enters and whispers the Emperor
whilst PORPHYRIUS speaks

  Por From Berenice I cannot go away
  But like a ghost must near my treasure stay

  Alb Night and this shape secure them from their eyes

  Por Have courage then for our bold enterprize
  Duty and faith no tie on me can have
  Since I renounced those honours which he gave

  Max The time is come we did so long attend
                                                              To BER
  Which must these discords of our marriage end
  Yet Berenice remember you have been
  An empress and the wife of Maximin

  Ber I will remember I have been your wife
  And therefore dying beg from heaven your life
  Be all the discords of our bed forgot
  Which virtue witness I did never spot
  What errors I have made though while I live
  You cannot pardon to the dead forgive

  Max How much she is to piety inclined
  Behead her while shes in so good a mind

  Por Stand firm Albinus now the time is come
  To free the empress

  Alb And deliver Rome

  Por Within I feel my hot blood swell my heart
  And generous trembling in each outward part
  Tis done tyrant this is thy latest hour
                                        PORPHYRIUS and ALBINUS draw
                                         and are making at the Emperor

  Ber Look to yourself my lord the emperor
  Treason help help my lord
                         MAXIMIN turns and defends himself the Guards
                          set on PORPHYRIUS and ALBINUS

  Max Disarm them but their lives I charge you spare
                                             After they are disarmed
  Unmask them and discover who they are
  Good Gods is it Porphyrius whom I see

  Plac I wonder how he gained his liberty

  Max Traitor

  Por Know tyrant I can hear that name
  Rather than son and bear it with less shame
  Traitors a name which were my arm yet free
  The Roman senate would bestow on thee
  Ah madam you have ruined my design
                                                              To BER
  And lost your life for I regard not mine
  Too ill a mistress and too good a wife

  Ber It was my duty to preserve his life

  Max Now I perceive
                                                              To POR
  In what close walk your mind so long did move
  You scorned my throne aspiring to her love

  Ber In death Ill own a love to him so pure
  As will the test of heaven itself endure
  A love so chaste as conscience could not chide
  But cherish it and keep it by its side
  A love which never knew a hot desire
  But flamed as harmless as a lambent fire
  A love which pure from soul to soul might pass
  As light transmitted through a crystal glass
  Which gave Porphyrius all without a sin
  Yet kept entire the right of Maximin

  Max The best return that I to both can make
  Shall be to suffer for each others sake

  Por Barbarian do not dare her blood to shed
  Who from my vengeance saved thy cursed head
  A flight no honour ever reached before
  And which succeeding ages will adore

  Ber Porphyrius I must die
  That common debt to nature paid must be
  But I have left a debt unpaid to thee
  To Maximin
  I have performed the duty of a wife
  But saving his I cast away thy life
  Ah what ill stars upon our loves did shine
  That I am more thy murdrer than he mine

  Max Make haste

  Por So hasty none in execution are
  But they allow the dying time for prayer
  Farewell sweet saint my prayer shall be to you
  My love has been unhappy but twas true
  Remember meAlas what have I said
  You must die too
  But yet remember me when you are dead

  Ber If I die first I will
  Stop short of heaven and wait you in a cloud
  For fear we lose each other in the crowd

  Por Love is the only coin in heaven will go
  Then take all with you and leave none below

  Ber Tis want of knowledge not of love I fear
  Lest we mistake when bodies are not there
  O as a mark that I could wear a scroll
  With this inscriptionBerenices soul

  Por That needs not sure for none will be so bright
  So pure or with so small allays of light

  Max From my full eyes fond tears begin to start
  Dispatchthey practise treason on my heart

  Por Adieu This farewell sigh I as my last bequeath
  Catch ittis love expiring in a breath

  Ber This sigh of mine shall meet it half the way
  As pledges given that each for other stay

Enter VALERIA and CYDON

  Val What dismal scene of death is here prepard

  Max Now strike

  Val They shall not strike till I am heard

  Max From whence does this new impudence proceed
  That you dare alter that which I decreed

  Val Ah sir to what strange courses do you fly
  To make yourself abhorred for cruelty
  The empire groans under your bloody reign
  And its vast body bleeds in every vein
  Gasping and pale and fearing more it lies
  And now you stab it in the very eyes
  Your Csar and the partner of your bed
  Ah who can wish to live when they are dead
  If ever gentle pity touchd your breast
  I cannot speakmy tears shall speak the rest
                                                 Weeping and sobbing

  Por She adds new grief to what I felt before
  And fate has now no room to put in more

  Max Away thou shame and slander of my blood
                                                          To VALERIA
  Who taught thee to be pitiful or good

  Val What hope have I
  The name of virtue should prevail with him
  Who thinks even it for which I plead a crime
  Yet nature sure some argument may be
  If them you cannot pity pity me

  Max I will and all the world shall judge it so
  I will the excess of pity to you shew
  You ask to save
  A dangerous rebel and disloyal wife
  And I in mercywill not take your life

  Val You more than kill me by this cruelty
  And in their persons bid your daughter die
  I honour Berenices virtue much
  But for Porphyrius my love is such
  I cannot will not live when he is gone

  Max Ill do that cure for you which on myself is done
  You must like me your lovers life remove
  Cut off your hope and you destroy your love
  If it were hard I would not bid you try
  The medicine but tis but to let him die
  Yet since you are so soft which you call good
  And are not yet confirmed enough in blood
  To see his death
  Your frailty shall be favoured with this grace
  That they shall suffer in another place
  If after they are dead their memory
  By any chance into your mind be brought
  Laugh and divert it with some other thought
  Away with them

  Exeunt BERENICE PORPHYRIUS and ALBINUS carried off by Guards

  Val Since prayers nor tears can bend his cruel mind
                                                   Looking after POR
  Farewell the best and bravest of mankind
  How I have loved heaven knows but theres a fate
  Which hinders me from being fortunate
  My fathers crimes hang heavy on my head
  And like a gloomy cloud about me spread
  I would in vain be pious thats a grace
  Which heaven permits not to a tyrants race

  Max Hence to her tent the foolish girl convey

  Val Let me be just before I go away
  Placidius I have vowed to be your wife
  Take then my hand tis yours while I have life
  One moment here I must anothers be
  But this Porphyrius gives me back to thee
  Stabs herself twice and then PLACIDIUS wrests the Dagger from her

  Plac Help help the princess help

  Max What rage has urged this act which thou hast done

  Val Thou tyrant and thy crimes have pulled it on
  Thou who canst death with such a pleasure see
  Now take thy fill and glut thy sight in me
  ButIll the occasion of my death forget
  Save him I love and be my father yet
  I can no morePorphyrius my dear

  Cyd Alas she raves and thinks Porphyrius here

  Val Have I not yet deserved thee now I die
  Is Berenice still more fair than I
  Porphyrius do not swim before my sight
  Stand still and let me let me aim aright
  Stand still but while thy poor Valeria dies
  And sighs her soul into her lovers eyes
                                                                Dies

  Plac Shes gone from earth and with her went away
  All of the tyrant that deserved to stay
  Ive lost in her all joys that life can give
  And only to revenge her death would live
                                                               Aside

  Cyd The gods have claimed her and we must resign

  Max What had the Gods to do with me or mine
  Did I molest your heaven
  Why should you then make Maximin your foe
  Who paid you tribute which he need not do
  Your altars I with smoke of gums did crown
  For which you leaned your hungry nostrils down
  All daily gaping for my incense there
  More than your sun could draw you in a year
  And you for this these plagues on me have sent
  But by the Gods by Maximin I meant
  Henceforth I and my world
  Hostility with you and yours declare
  Look to it Gods for you the aggressors are
  Keep you your rain and sunshine in your skies
  And Ill keep back my flame and sacrifice
  Your trade of heaven shall soon be at a stand
  And all your goods lie dead upon your hand

  Plac Thus tyrant since the Gods the aggressors are
                                                        Stabbing him
  Thus by this stroke they have begun the war
            MAXIMIN struggles with him and gets the dagger from him

  Max Thus I return the strokes which they have given
                                                  Stabbing PLACIDIUS
  Thus traitor thus and thus I would to heaven
          PLACIDIUS falls and the Emperor staggers after him
           and sits down upon him the Guards come to help the Emperor

  Max Stand off and let me ere my strength be gone
  Take my last pleasure of revenge alone

Enter a Centurion

  Cent Arm arm the camp is in a mutiny
  For Rome and liberty the soldiers cry
  Porphyrius moved their pity as he went
  To rescue Berenice from punishment
  And now he heads their new attempted crime

  Max Now I am down the Gods have watchd their time
  You think
  To save your credit feeble deities
  But I will give myself the strength to rise
                       He strives to get up and being up staggers
  It wonnot be
  My body has not power my mind to bear
  I must return againand conquer here
                                             Sits down upon the body
  My coward body does my will controul
  Farewell thou base deserter of my soul
  Ill shake this carcase off and be obeyed
  Reign an imperial ghost without its aid
  Go soldiers take my ensigns with you fight
  And vanquish rebels in your sovereigns right
  Before I die
  Bring me Porphyrius and my empress dead
  I would brave heaven in my each hand a head

  Plac Do not regard a dying tyrants breath
  He can but look revenge on you in death
                                                     To the Soldiers

  Max Vanquished and darst thou yet a rebel be
  Thus I can more than look revenge on thee
                                                     Stabs him again

  Plac Oh I am gone
                                                                Dies

  Max And after thee I go
  Revenging still and following evn to the other world my blow
                                                     Stabs him again
  And shoving back this earth on which I sit
  Ill mount and scatter all the Gods I hit
                                                                Dies

Enter PORPHYRIUS BERENICE ALBINUS Soldiers PORPHYRIUS looks on
the Bodies entering and speaks

  Por Tis done before this mighty work of fate
  And I am glad your swords are come too late
  He was my prince and though a bloody one
  I should have conquered and have mercy shewn
  Sheath all your swords and cease your enmity
  They are not foes but Romans whom you see

  Ber He was my tyrant but my husband too
  And therefore duty will some tears allow

  Por Placidius here
  And fair Valeria new deprived of breath
  Who can unriddle this dumbshow of death

  Cyd When sir her father did your life deny
  She killed herself that she with you might die
  Placidius made the emperors death his crime
  Who dying did revenge his death on him
                       PORPHYRIUS kneels and takes VALERIAS hand

  Por For thy dear sake I vow each week I live
  One day to fasting and just grief Ill give
  And what hard fate did to thy life deny
  My gratitude shall pay thy memory

  Cent Meantime to you belongs the imperial power
  We with one voice salute you emperor

  Sold Long life Porphyrius emperor of the Romans

  Por Too much my countrymen your love you shew
  That you have thought me worthy to be so
  But to requite that love I must take care
  Not to engage you in a civil war
  Two emperors at Rome the senate chose
  And whom they chuse no Roman should oppose
  In peace or war let monarchs hope or fear
  All my ambition shall be bounded here
                                           Kissing BERENICES hand

  Ber I have too lately been a princes wife
  And fear the unlucky omen of the life
  Like a rich vessel beat by storms to shore
  Twere madness should I venture out once more
  Of glorious trouble I will take no part
  And in no empire reign but of your heart

  Por Let to the winds your golden eagles fly
                                                     To the Soldiers
  Your trumpets sound a bloodless victory
  Our arms no more let Aquileia fear
  But to her gates our peaceful ensigns bear
  While I mix cypress with my myrtle wreath
  Joy for your life and mourn Valerias death
                                                              Exeunt




  EPILOGUE

  SPOKEN BY
  MRS ELLENO WHEN SHE WAS TO BE CARRIED OFF DEAD BY THE BEARERS


TO THE BEARER

  Hold are you mad You damnd confounded dog
  I am to rise and speak the epilogue

TO THE AUDIENCE

  I come kind gentlemen strange news to tell ye
  I am the ghost of poor departed Nelly
  Sweet ladies be not frighted Ill be civil
  Im what I was a little harmless devil
  For after death we spirits have just such natures
  We had for all the world when human creatures
  And therefore I that was an actress here
  Play all my tricks in hell a goblin there
  Gallants look tot you say there are no sprites
  But Ill come dance about your beds at nights
  And faith youll be in a sweet kind of taking
  When I surprise you between sleep and waking
  To tell you true I walk because I die
  Out of my calling in a tragedy
  O poet damnd dull poet who could prove
  So senseless to make Nelly die for love
  Nay whats yet worse to kill me in the prime
  Of Easterterm in tart and cheesecake time
  Ill fit the fop for Ill not one word say
  To excuse his godly outoffashion play
  A play which if you dare but twice sit out
  Youll all be slandered and be thought devout
  But farewell gentlemen make haste to me
  Im sure eer long to have your company
  As for my epitaph when I am gone
  Ill trust no poet but will write my own
  Here Nelly lies who though she lived a slattern
  Yet died a princess acting in St Catharine
