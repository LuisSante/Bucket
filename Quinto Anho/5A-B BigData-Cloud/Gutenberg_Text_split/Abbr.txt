Walther Von Koenigsburg woke up a few moments after the earth shuttle
had passed Venus As he gazed back at the lonely shrouded planet
abandoned long ago when Man won freedom to colonize more habitable
worlds in deep space Walther realized that in just a matter of minutes
his long pilgrimage would be over Soon he would walk down the ramp and
set foot on Earththe almost mythical homeland of his people Walther
was young enough and old enough not to be ashamed of the sudden
choking in his throat the moisture in his eyes

A light touch on his shoulder brought him back to the shuttle ship The
pert stewardess smiled at his start

Wyslgsr she asked pleasantly

Or at least thats what it sounded like to Walther whose ears were
still ringing from the take off at the Cyngus III shuttleport

I beg your pardon he began Im afraid

For a moment she looked startled then her full red lips parted in
another bright smile

Oh Im sorry she exclaimed I didnt realize  I just asked
Sir whether you had been sleeping

She spoke with the mechanical stilted perfection he had first noted
when transferring from the Aldebaran liner at the shuttleport He had
wondered briefly about the source of the accent but had been too
polite to ask

The stewardess put a small pillow in his lap then placed a tray on
it The recessed compartments of the tray held a cup of steaming black
coffee a piece of pastry that reminded Walther of apfelstrudel and a
papercovered booklet entitled Easy Earth Dictionary and Orientation
Manual Stamped on the cover in the manner of an official seal were
the words Prepared under the authorization of Happy Time Ltd

Thank you said Walther then he grinned buoyantly eager to share
these moments of excitement at being so close to Earth But I dont
think Ill need the dictionary

Tiny frown lines appeared between the stewardesss carefully arched
eyebrows

Hg suv rthsr she inquired uncertainly

I dont understand

The stewardess managed a professional smile that was edged with just
the faintest touch of impatience

Thats what I thought What I asked Sir was how long since youve
been on Earth

This is my first visit

Then you had better study the dictionary she said firmly

Oh no I really dont need it Walthers inner excitement showed
in the flush of his fair Nordic complexion He turned toward her in a
burst of confidence You see my people always kept alive their native
languages My fathers side of the family was German  and down
through all the generations theyve managed to teach the language to
their children It was the same way with my mothers family who were
English Pride came into his voice I could speak both languages
by the time I was four

And youve never taken this shuttle from Cyngus

Ive never been on Cyngus beforenor on Aldebaran VIDeneb IIor
Arcturus IX explained Walther naming the farflung way station across
the galaxy He added Im on my way in from NeustadtAndromeda you
know

Respect replaced the hint of impatience in the stewardesss smile
which instantly became more personal Not for generations had a
colonist from the Andromeda galaxy boarded this shuttle the Andromeda
run across  light years of space could be made only by
special charter at a fantastic cost This blonde young man with
the stubborn chin and sensitive mouth was obviously a colonial of
tremendous wealth

The pilots buzzer sounded and a red light flickered on the Passenger
Instruction panel

I have to go forward now the stewardess said regretfully Were
entering the warp and its time to prepare for landing Maybe
later

She let the invitation trail off and left him with a very special
smile

Walther understood the smile He was a young man but he was no fool
In the trading centers of Andromeda many women smiled at him that way
when they learned he was a Von Koenigsburg from Neustadt

He dunked the pastry in the black coffee took a generous bite and
settled back to be alone with his thoughts An earth woman was not an
essential part of the dream that had taken him on this quixotic voyage
True there might be a woman who would come to love him enough so that
she would leave the old world culture and graciousness of Earth for
the colonial life on the immense frontier of Andromeda But being of
an age where the dreams of youth are merging with practicality Walther
rather doubted he would find such a woman

He didnt doubt that the rest of his dream would come gloriously to
life

While the shuttleship whirled without motion through the voidless void
of hyper space Walther smiled at the prospect ahead Six months to
immerse himself in the wonder of Earths culture Six months to enjoy
the whole of it instead of nourishing the few precious fragments kept
alive by his family through the first centuries of colonial life in the
new galaxy

Delightful evenings at the symphony and the opera Beethoven Verdi
Brahms Schubert and Wagner WagnerPerhaps he would even be able
to attend a performance of Die Meistersinger Walther smiled to
himself His great great grandfather who had first discovered the
incredibly rich mines forests and black loam of Neustadt had started
the tradition of naming the first son Walther after the whimsical
Meistersinger Walther von der Vogelweide

Then there would be leisurely afternoons in the great libraries and
museums All the great classics of literature and art instead of
the few faded pictures and the handful of volumes in the high beamed
library of his family castle The infrequent ships that traveled
between the fringes of the two galaxies had little room for books
and art treasures Three years ago on the occasion of Walthers
twentyfirst birthday his mother had broken down in tears as she told
of trying for half a decade to order a set of Goethe as a coming of
age present for him But after the request had finally reached Earth
some clerk had garbled the order and sent a fourpage booklet that
apparently was some kind of puzzlebook for children

Now he could steep himself in Goethe Schiller Dickens Maupassant
Tolstoi

And best of all the conversation The delicate art of communicating
mind with mind What tales he would have to tell when he sat again in
the family banquet hall How his mothers eyes would sparkle How his
father would roar with delight as he recounted some rapierlike bon
mot

But all this was only the small part of the dream The small personal
part The dream itself was so much bigger as big as a dream must be
to carry over from youth to manhood He had first dreamed it as a boy
sitting on the hearth rug with his knees tucked up under his chin
watching the great leaping fire while behind him in the shadows his
grandfather played on the old violin Meditation his grandfather
had called it By a long ago composer of Earth a man strangely named
Thais His grandfather couldnt play very much of it but the fragment
had lodged in Walthers heart and would be there to the end of his life

Walthers dream was indeed a grand dream shaped of a melody and
leaping flames He would not spend his lifetime wresting more wealth
from the riches of Neustadt That had been done for him the challenge
was gone But someday he would make the journey to Earth and bring
back with him enough of the beauty and culture to make Neustadt a
miniature Earth out on the rim of Andromeda

It was indeed a grand dream He would spend his wealth for books and
music and treasures of art He would try to bring back artists and
teachers too and from Neustadt would spread the wonder of the new
old culture it would reach out to all the colonies of the Andromeda
galaxy giving texture to life And it would be there like a shining
beacon when Man made his next great step across space across the
millions of light years to the Camora galaxy and beyond

The stewardess again touched his shoulder with a gesture that was not
entirely according to shuttleship regulations

Were through the warp and are now in orbit she said Well land at
Uniport in three minutes

Uniport The fabled entry port of Earth It was the new hub the
pulsing heart of the homeland It was the syndrome of all Earth
culture and its stratoways reached out like spokes of a spidery wheel
to every city of the planet

Walthers knees were a little shaky as he moved down the ramp and
the moisture in the corners of his eyes was not caused by the sleety
December wind that whipped across the vast landing area He was on
Earth He was the first of his people to return to the fatherland that
had cradled them and sent them out into the universe

When the stewardess said goodby to him at the foot of the ramp she
looked both puzzled and disappointed Her smile had been an invitation
and she had sensed the tug of it in his answering grin But he only
tipped his hat and went on into the customs office

He felt like a small boy suddenly confronted by so many delights that
he knew not which to sample first

                                   

Destination

The customs officers blue pencil poised over the question on the
Uniport entry form Walther shrugged carelessly

Oh Ill look around Uniport awhile then visit other cities  New
York  London  Vienna I have six months you know

I knowIm sure youll enjoy your happy time But you must have a
destinationsomeplace where you can be contacted or leave forwarding
addresses The officials voice was patient but it had the curious
mechanical quality Walther had noted in speech of the pretty young
stewardess

Can you recommend good lodging

The Uniport landing provides excellent facilities and youll be among
other travelers until you have a chance to adjust yourself to happy
time activities

Oh no I dont want to waste a moment I want to live among the
people of Earth from this very first night

The customs officer peered at Walthers entry permit

Andromeda  thats what I thought He shook his head dubiously
You have your Orientation Manual

Walther fumbled in the pockets of his greatcoat

I must have left it on the shuttleship but I dont need it

The official pressed another copy of the manual firmly into Walthers
hands

It is required he said First visitors are not allowed to leave the
Uniport landing without one

Walther was too happy to argue He shoved the manual into one of
pockets

If I may suggest Sir said the customs officer his eyes widening as
he looked over Walthers letters of credit You will find the Hotel
Altair most comfortable Its where all important visitors in Uniport
stay

The next few moments went by so quickly they left Walther a little
dazed A servorobot took his bags and led him to a monorail car which
whisked him off to the hotel

Gdegr said the doorman another servorobot in a brilliant scarlet
uniform Its waxlike features were set in a perpetual smile

Walther blinked

Im sorry he began I

Thayr said the majestic robot taking Walthers handtooled overnight
bag and motioning imperiously for two bellhop robots to bring the rest
of the luggage Silent and smiling they leaped to obey

The desk clerk was a human and greeted Walther with an efficient

Wemtalr

He offered Walther a pen and a registration card on which appeared some
undecipherable combination of letters

Walther began to have a sense of unreality about the whole thing as if
he were still daydreaming in the Venus warp

Really he said I seem to be quite confused

With a smile of sudden comprehension the clerk produced a Manual and
thumbed rapidly through its pages He pointed to a phrase with the tip
of his pen and Walther read

What price room do you desire

Opposite these words was the phonetic jumble

Whprumuirer

Walther shrugged to indicate that price was not important but his
thoughts were spinning And they were still spinning when the robot
bellhop left him alone in his suite The possibility of a language
barrier on Earth was something he had never considered With only six
months planned for his visit it would be impossible to learn a new
language and still do all he had dreamed of doing

But the Von Koenigsburgs were noted for their stubbornness Walthers
chin set and he opened the Manual to learn what this was all about

He promptly realized that this was a Manual only for the most
elementary needs of conversation and that a great amount of study
would be necessary for normal discourse The first section of the
Manual devoted a short chapter to each of the basic languages of
Earth Turning from one to another Walther discovered that an extreme
degree of condensation had taken place in all languages It was as
though a form of speedwriting and shorthand had been vocalized

But why What did it mean

Walther found a partial explanation in the Orientation section which
began

Be brief

Soyez bref

Mach es kurz

Sea breze

In a score of languages firsttime visitors were admonished that an
understanding of these two words was essential to getting maximum
enjoyment out of their stay on Earth

Even in an earlier age the introduction pointed out the words Be
Brief expressed the essence of a new way of life a life in which
pace and tempo were all important Later as technology and automation
relieved man of the burden of labor he realized that tempo was equally
important to fullest enjoyment of his happy time hours You will
understand this better after a few pleasant days on Earth

There was a false ring to the words that heightened Walthers sense of
forboding

Under the glass top of his dressing table he saw several brightly
colored attractively illustrated notices One in particular caught
his attention It showed a young woman with lovely and poignantly
expressive features Her hands were outstretched as though she were
singing or engaged in a dramatic scene

With the help of his Manual Walther ascertained that the young woman
was named Maria Piavi and that she was an Italian operatic soprano
appearing currently in Uniport with a New York company

Walthers buoyancy began to return What better way to become
acquainted with Earths culture than to spend his first evening at the
opera He removed the announcement with Maria Piavis picture from
under the glass and stood it upright against the mirror

Dinner in the hotels main dining room was a confusing interlude The
cuisine was superb the robot waiter faultlessalthough Walther was
beginning to weary of their fixed smiles But more irritating was the
flicker of huge tridimensional television screens on the walls of the
dining room When he deciphered his bill he saw he had been taxed for
the TV entertainment

After dinner he showed the opera announcement to the hotel clerk
and asked how to get there The clerk wrote down the number of the
monorail car he was to take but when Walther learned the opera house
was only six blocks away he decided to walk The clerk was aghast at
this and followed him all the way to the sidewalk waving his arms and
protesting in an hysterical jumble of consonants

                                   

The opera house itself was a revelation All he had dreamed of
and more The frescoed facade The dazzling marquee The crowd of
elegantly dressed men and women animatedly speaking their strange
syllables as they watched a floor show in the lobby When the floor
show ended and the crowd shifted to the far end where a pantomimist
was beginning his act Walther had a dear view of the lifesize cutout
of Maria Piavi in the center of the lobby

He stood in front of it staring with unashamed admiration There was
an earthiness and warmth about her that reminded him of the young women
of his own planet Paradoxically there was also an air of remoteness
and rigid selfdiscipline a sense of emotion eternally controlled
He wondered which was the real Maria Beside her picture was the
photograph of a peppery old man whom Walther was able to identify as
Willy Fritsh The consonants under his name said he was now a producer
and had formerly directed for many years

Walther purchased his ticket without too much difficulty The lights
blinked and he followed the crowd into the orchestra section

As he sank into the luxury of upholstered seat Walther opened his
senses to the sounds and sights about him the tingling scent of the
lovely women the ebb and flow of indistinguishable conversation the
strange short bursts of music which he found to be emanating from a
tiny jeweled radio in the purse of the woman who sat next to him

His excitement and anticipation grew still greater when he carefully
deciphered the program and discovered that Maria Piavi was to sing
Gilda in Rigoletto this very evening What unbelievable good luck
Rigoletto to commemorate his first evening on Earth Walther vaguely
knew the story of the opera but from earliest childhood he could
remember his mother singing snatches of Caro Nome and La donna e
mobile Now he would hear the entire arias the full score of this
masterpiece

Suddenly all was quiet The orchestra rose swiftly into view in front
of the stage The whitehaired leader bowed There was an eruption of
applause as brief as the crack of a rocket breaking the sound barrier
The golden baton rose a glorious burst of music filled the opera house
and the velvet curtain zipped upward so rapidly that the blinking of an
eye would have missed it

The opening scene of festal entertainment in the hall of the ducal
palace was a masterpiece in conception but the gay cavaliers and
ladies the Dukes twentysecond condensation of the Questa o quella
ballata the plotting with Rigoletto and the mocking of Monterone were
all accomplished and done with before Walther knew what was happening

Then he realized that he was looking upon a tremendous revolving stage
divided into many exquisite sets Each set appeared majestically
established itself often with an almost indiscernable pause and then
moved out of view to be replaced by the next

The second scene was the deserted street outside Rigolettos cottage
Rigoletto appeared and disappeared Gilda and the disguised Duke
flashed through their duets the orchestra set up the briefest of
fanfares and the lovely Maria Piavi moved to the center of the stage
to sing Gildas immortal aria

    Caro nome che il me cor

The words electrified Walther to the edge of his seat Here were the
first naturally spoken words of the opera the words of Gilda as she
expressed joy at learning the name of her lover Walthers mother had
sung the haunting words on many an evening as he drifted off to sleep
in his nursery But he had never heard them phrased so beautifully as
they came now from the lips of Maria Piavi After the numbing shock of
the first scene they started the blood throbbing in his temples again

But they were the last words he understood of the aria

Using the archaic phrase with superb showmanship to startle her
audience Maria swung with flawless technique into a contraction of
verse and music that somehow managed to convey the beauty of both in
the few seconds that she held the center of the stage It was like
passing a star just before you entered hyperspace You saw it for an
instant it awed and choked you with its wonder and then it vanished
into a nothingness that was deeper than night

There was so much beauty in the fragment that Walther ached to hear the
rest of the aria But Gilda had been abducted to the Dukes palace and
the stage had revolved far into Act II before Walther could assimilate
the realization that no more of Caro Nome would be heard this
evening or any evening

Nothing mattered after this not even the Dukes halfminute
condensation of La donna e mobile The stage picked up momentum
thunder and lightning flashed the murdered Gildas body was discovered
by her father in the sack beside the river the final curtain swooped
down over the grisly horror the orchestra disappeared lights flashed
on and Walther found himself being hurried along with the pleased
audience toward the exit where servorobots were passing out handbills
and pointing to a theatre across the street

The entire opera had lasted eleven minutes

                                   

Stunned his dream crumbling Walther stood outside the opera house
and watched the crowd disappear into the theatre across the street or
plunge into passing monorail cars The wind of the late afternoon was
gone A light snow was falling it melted on his cheeks and powdered
the fur collar of his greatcoat Some of the younger couples didnt
immediately board the monorail They walked around to the stage exit
and waited laughing and chattering Walther joined them

In a few moments members of the cast began to appear They waved gaily
at friends in the crowd

Maria came out in the company of two young men followed closely by the
peppery brighteyed little man whom Walther recognized from the lobby
poster as being Willy Fritsh the producer The young couples closed
around them applauding Walther shouldered his way toward the center
of the group

Maria was laughing with excitement This was the warm earthy Maria
not the exquisite almost aloof artist Walther had seen on the stage
She was a fulllipped gay Italian girl who was enjoying the plaudits
of her friends She was bundled in a white fur and her teeth flashed
as she tossed back a rippling comment to one of the young men standing
near Walther

As they started to move away Walther stepped forward in sudden
desperation

I beg pardon he said Can you wait while I try to ask one question

Maria looked startled and one of her escorts stepped quickly between
her and Walther

Whtstywt the young man snapped

Walther flushed at the tone He wasnt used to being spoken to this
way certainly not by anyone his own age His jaw set as he held on to
his self control and continued thumbing through the Manual

Then he noticed that Maria was being hurried along by her other escort
He tried to step around the young man blocking his path

The young man put out his arm and pushed against Walthers shoulder as
if to shove him back into the crowd

Out of the corner of his eye Walther saw Willy Fritsh hurrying forward
to intervene But his own reflexes were already in motion His left
hand flashed up the back of it struck the young man in the chest
Walther didnt intend it to be a blow merely a warning He even
managed to check it before it landed But to his bewilderment the
young man staggered back slumped to his knees gasping for breath

The other escort though whitefaced with fear hurled himself at
Walther

Still trying to maintain a measure of control Walther merely blocked
the second escort by thrusting out the palm of his hand The young man
toppled backward and the whole scene began to take on a nevernever
land quality

Girls screamed in terror the crowd around Walther scrambled out of his
reach Maria stared at him wideeyed but didnt move

Im terribly sorry Walther blurted

There was a shrill whistle a drumbeat of running feet on the cold
sidewalk Walther moved forward to help the young men to their feet
They shrank away from him and then he was surrounded by three armed
police officers shouting a gibberish of commands

Finally Willy Fritsh made himself heard He pointed to Walthers
manual and spoke a few patient words of explanation When one of the
officers still seemed unsatisfied Willy turned to Walther with a
twinkle in his eyes

They want to know if you are a professional pugilist

Walther felt immeasureably relieved at hearing these naturally spoken
words

Good Lord no he gasped

He took out his entry permits his identification certificate and his
letters of credit impressively drawn up on the stationery of the
InterGalactic Exchange Union on Deneb II

When the doubting officer saw the amount of the credits his hands
shook and he handed the papers back to Walther as if they were state
documents The officers helped the two young men to their feet
admonished them sharply tipped their hats to Walther and hurried back
to their posts

Willy regarded Walther quizzically

Well young man you seem to have very persuasive ways

At home it had been easy for Walther to slip from English to German
He did it now in the stress of the moment

Ich kann Ihnen nicht sagen wie leid es mir tut

He was in the middle of his apology before he realized he was talking
German He broke off in confusion Willys pink cheeks crinkled with
amusement

Ist schon gut Ich spreche auch das alte Deutsch

Willy went on to explain

As a young man I translated many of the German masters into our modern
happy time presentations Now what is it you wanted to ask Miss Maria

Walther addressed his question to Willy but he looked at Maria as he
spoke

I  I wanted to ask if she would ever consider singing Rigoletto in
its original form I would be happy to pay all expenses

Im sure you would Willy said drily But Miss Maria sings only the
pure happy time essence of Rigoletto Not for more than a century has
Verdis original version been sung on Earth

Maria looked puzzled during the interchange Willy translated for her
and she nodded in vigorous endorsement of his words There was a titter
of laughter from the young couples who had crowded around them again

Walther drew himself very erect

Thank you he said

He turned on his heel and walked into the darkness beyond the stage
exit He walked blindly into the snow flurries not caring where his
steps were taking him But he had not gone two hundred yards before he
realized he was being followed

                                   

Walther stopped and waited

The footsteps behind him drew closer A slight shadow bulked out of the
darkness and Walther heard Willy Fritsh say in German

Dont be alarmed young man

Willy came up and linked his arm through Walthers

Keep on walkingIts a cold night

The chill air rattled in Willys throat as he panted from the pace of
overtaking Walther When he caught his breath he asked

What sort of world do you come from Its quite amazing that someone
from the Andromeda galaxy should ask for the original Rigoletto

Walther told the old producer something of his home and family Willy
questioned him closely on several points and finally seemed satisfied

When they come from the stars he murmured

I beg your pardon

It is nothingjust the title of an old classic

At the next corner Willy stopped I leave you here

He stepped closer to Walther and lowered his voice even though there
was nothing around them but darkness and drifting snow

Would you care to sample a bit of Bohemia my boy

WellI guess so Walther answered doubtfully

Tomorrow evening then at eight  Avenue B apartment  Can you
remember that

 Avenue B apartment 

I must emphasize the need for discretion on your part There will be
important people present

Why do you trust me Walther challenged

Because I am an old fool chuckled Willy Fritsh

The chuckle emboldened Walther to ask one more question

Will Maria be there

Now you are a fool

Willy took a step away then returned flicked on his cigarette lighter
and studied Walther thoughtfully

Or maybe not he murmured Maybe not Perhaps Maria could be there
this once

He snapped out the lighter

With another chuckle Willy disappeared into the darkness

 Avenue B apartment  Eight oclock tomorrow evening The
directions whirled all night through Walthers fitful sleep They
intermingled with a strange company of servorobots unintelligible
phrases the dry chuckle of Willy Fritsh and the haunting voice of
Maria Piavi beginning an aria she would never finish

The next day Walther determined to find out how the cult of brevity
had changed other fields of Earths culture He went first to the
library where foreboding hardened into bitter reality Classic after
classic was cut to its essence Hamlet was reduced to a total reading
time of seven minutes But the old librarian seemed embarrassed about
this

By mutual reference to the Manual she managed to convey to him that a
new edition would be out soon and that it would be edited down to five
minutes reading time Did he want to sign up for a copy

Walther gave her a stricken look and silently shook his head

Puzzled she led him to the other classics on his list Each was a new
blow Great Expectations was cut to twenty pages all of Thoreau to
one thin pamphlet Henry James to a pocketsize digest of less than ten
pages Leaves of Grass to a few lines of verse

Walthers sense of loss became more than personal He saw uncounted
generations of boys who would never know Whitman who might never have
time for the open road in the Spring the sweet springtime of life The
road and the poem they were part of each other Without one the other
could not live

The fire of Walthers dream flamed up fiercely within him There was
yet time for beauty in Andromeda Time for quiet and thinking and true
leisure Somehow he must rescue the treasures of the ages from the
tomb of Earth and let them live again threequarters of a million
light years away

He beckoned to the old librarian and laboriously communicated his
question

The originals of these classicswhere are they

She frowned in bewilderment He pointed to the proper words again and
gestured with his hands to indicate a large book

A smile of understanding replaced her frown She consulted a larger
edition of his own Manual and wrote

Digesters Vaultslower six levels

He wrote back

Can I go down there

After some delay she encoded the answer

Only authorized happy time Digesters are permitted in the vaults

Walther thanked her glumly His spirits were so depressed that not even
the digested version of the Bible shocked him too greatly The Old
Testament amounted to eleven pages in rather large type the Gospel of
St Mark was three paragraphs the Acts of the Apostles spanned less
than half a page

Walther left the library and the icy wind roused him from depression
It lashed him to anger to a desperate unreasoning anger that drove
him to find somewhere on Earth an ember of the old culture Somewhere
he had to find such an ember and bring it back to Neustadt where it
would flame again

He managed to get directions to the Vienna stratowaycar Surely in
Vienna he would find some trace of the spirit left by Mozart and Haydn
Beethoven Schubert and Strauss

Ten minutes later when he left the stratoway in the Platz terminal
near the Vienna Ring his heart beat a little faster This was indeed
the old Vienna as he had envisaged it from the few pictures he had
seen and the many stories he had been told The buildings on the Ring
were in good repair and not substantially altered There was the Burg
Theatre the Art and History Museum the buttressed facade of the
ancient Opera House the soaring twin spires of the Votive Church It
was like seeing an old woodcut come to life

But for Walther that was all that came to life in Vienna The Burg
Theatre was currently presenting Faust in what was billed as a
brilliant new production scaled down to seventeen minutes Walther
sadly recalled Goethes prophetic line Mein Lied ertont der unbekaten
Menge My song sounds to the unknown multitude

Wandering outside the city itself into the footpaths of the
Wienerwald Walther tried to lose himself among the gentle slopes and
the old trees that cut latticework into the sky He came suddenly upon
the village of Tullnerzing where from a tiny sidewalk cafe music of
a stringed ensemble came in short quick bursts It was scherzo speeded
up a hundredfold with not three but an infinite number of quarter
notes blurred into what sounded like a single beat

These were the Vienna woods How could he ever tell his mother and
father Heartsick he returned to the Platz and found the Berlin
stratoway

In Berlin his bitterness grew He had known the Unter den Linden must
have changed through the centuries but he was not prepared for such
a pace of life such a frenzy of leisure Better not to have left
Andromeda Better always to have lived with a dream

The sight of two elderly burghers drinking beer reminded him of his
own great grandfather and gave him a heartening twinge of nostalgia
But as he stepped close to their table he saw that as they sipped
from their miniature steins the fingers of their free hands beat out a
rhythmic accompaniment to the convolutions of an adagio team imaged on
the tabletop television screen

The final irony came to him when he read the lines of Schiller carved
over the entrance to a museum near the Brandenburg Gate Because
they were cut deep into the old stone they could not be erased or
condensed They were there to give their ironic message to a world that
could no longer read them

Only through the morning gateway of the beautiful did you enter the
land of knowledge

And beneath them was Schillers immortal warning to the artist

    Der Menschheit Wurde ist in eure Hand gegeben

    Bewahret sie

Walther copied the entire passage on the back of his Manual This
at least he could take back with him These words he could preserve
for the artists who would someday create their works of beauty on the
frontier of Andromeda As he copied them Walther felt that the words
were also a personal message from Schiller to himself

    The dignity of Mankind is placed in your hands

    Preserve it

    Whether it sinks or rises depends on you

    The holy spell of poetry

    Serves a wise world order

    May it guide man to that great sea

    Where harmony prevails

The words sustained Walthers spirits until he left the stratoway in
Paris and went to the Louvre He had told himself that by this time
nothing could shock him that he could take any blow But the Louvre
was a new shock all over again

Translating a title with the help of his Manual and the servorobot
guide Walther found that the thin wavering line about two inches
long against a background of misty blue was the Mona Lisa

The servorobot explained after much searching among its tapes for
words

This is the spirit of the famous Mona Lisa smile The Happy Time
artist has cleverly removed all nonessential detail so that you can
get the meaning of the picture in the minimum amount of time

Walther studied the thin wavering line This then was Da Vincis
eternal enigma of womanhood Perhaps it explained why he felt there
were two Marias Could there be one whole woman in a culture of
fragmented lives

The portraits of Holbein were reduced to a few sprinkles of geometric
designs shot through with a single brilliant color The nudes of
Watteau Rubens and Velazquez were little more than shadow curves

In the east wing of the Louvre the servorobot pointed to a series of
larger paintings Each of these Walther learned summarized the entire
life work of a single artist Here it was possible to see all of Titian
or Michaelangelo or Van Gogh on one simplified canvas

Where were the originals of these classics In the cultural vaults at
Uniport the servorobot explained Only authorized Happy Time artists
could work with them

Afterwards Walther was never quite certain what happened to the
rest of his day Distraught he wandered around the Earth changing
from stratoway to stratoway scarcely paying any heed to his next
destination Rome Athens Moscow Jerusalem Everywhere the pace of
leisure was the same Capetown New Delhi Tibet Tokyo San Francisco
Everywhere he saw something that crumbled his dream a little more The
Buddhist monk pausing for ten seconds of meditation while he counted
his beads not one by one but in groups of twenty the World Government
Chamber where the Senator from the United States filibustered a
proposal to death by speaking for the unprecedented period of four
minutes the cafe near the school where teenage boys and girls
immense numbers of them danced snapped their fingers and shrieked
ecstatically as the latest popular record exploded in a wild threenote
burst of sound

It was seven oclock in the evening before Walther became aware of the
time He was half the Earth and just one hour away from his meeting
with Willy Fritsh

 Avenue B apartment 

A bit of Bohemia Willy had promised him The words disturbed Walther
He had been disappointed so often in his twentyfour hours on Earth
that he didnt feel like bracing himself for another letdown Nor did
he feel in the mood for a gay evening if that was what Willy had meant

Would Maria be there

Walther shook his head angrily He was indeed a fool if he expected
anything after this day

                                   

 Avenue B was only a few moments by monorail from the Hotel Altair
A gentlefaced woman who reminded Walther of his own mother answered
his knock on the door of Apartment 

Kdftc she inquired politely

Walther stared at her Was this all a cruel joke played by Willy
Fritsh Certainly this elderly woman this quiet building contained no
Bohemia to be spoken of with discretion

Excuse me he muttered not even bothering to consult his Manual He
bowed and backed away Im afraid Ive made a mistake

She stayed him with a small gesture of her delicate fingers Glancing
swiftly up and down the hall she beckoned him inside When the door
was closed she smiled a bright welcome and spoke in the old tongue

Youre the young man from Andromeda

Walther felt the tension inside him beginning to relax He nodded and
she took his arm

Willy told usweve been expecting you

She led him from the small foyer into a large tastefully furnished
living room Walther glanced around uncertainly but his first
impression proved correct There was no one else here

The woman urged him forward with a light touch of her fingertips

We must be so careful she murmured

She guided him through the living room past the kitchen and one
bedroom and then opened the door of what appeared to be the entrance
to a second bedroom

This room was unexpectedly large and contained many people They were
talking with great animation but hushed abruptly as he entered

The young man from Andromeda his hostess announced

The dry voice of Willy Fritsh came through the haze of cigarette smoke

Over here boy Come and sit down

He saw Willy and Maria sitting on a long cushion against the far wall
They moved over to make room for him Maria smiled rather hesitantly
He sensed she was very ill at ease

Ill introduce you around later said Willy Everybodys too keyed
up right now Weve just had an unexpected surprisereally quite
startling

The conversation had bubbled up again and there was an electric
feeling of excitement in the air Everyone was trying to talk at the
same time Cheeks were flushed eyes sparkled

While everyone was talking to those nearest the most constantly
recurring focal point of attention was the thin balding man seated
just across the room from Walther on the arm of the sofa He was
riffling the pages of a pocketsize notebook and smiling with
selfconscious pride

Willy nodded toward the man

Theres the gentleman who furnished our surpriseHe brought shorthand
notes on an entire chapter from Don Quixote

After the day he had just been through Walther could appreciate this
He asked wonderingly

Where did he get them

Hes a Happy Time Digester

Walther studied the little man So this was one of the comparative few
on Earth who could get into the deep vaults of the Uniport library
What wonders he must have explored What beauty and adventure what
mindstretching thoughts he must encounter in those underground
catacombs How deep into the past he could explore how far into the
future Why he could range the universe faster than the warp drive
out even beyond the Andromeda galaxy

Willy cut into his thoughts

Hes going to read the entire chapter

Walther turned to Maria to see if she shared his excitement It was the
aloof controlled Maria who smiled faintly at him It was obvious she
had come against her will and was trying to be gracious about it

A middleaged couple arrived

Dr and Mrs Althuss Willy whispered Hes the famous heart
surgeon

The next arrival was a distinguished looking man whose fingers shook
with nervousness

Thats the World Government alternate delegate from England Willy
whispered again It wouldnt do his reputation any good for word to
get out that he spent an evening in this Bohemian crowd

Their hostess moved to the center of the room raised her hand and
announced

Were all here now Please go ahead Lorne

The room quieted instantly The thin little man proudly began in the
old English

    Don Cervante at the Castle

His reading was painfully slow and he stumbled over the pronunciation
of many words The people in the room watched him so intensely with
such absolute concentration that they gave the impression of reading
his lips rather than listening to his words Frequently he would have
to translate a word or phrase into the new language and there would
be nods of understanding and relief

Willys bright blue eyes sparkled more brightly than ever He ran his
fingers constantly through his thin bristle of white hair The elderly
woman on the sofa beside the Digester was so flushed and breathing so
rapidly that Walther feared she was on the verge of a stroke Even the
urbane heart surgeon showed the emotional impact of this experience
His long tapered fingers were clenched together and he ran his under
lip constantly over the edge of his greying mustache

Maria seemed the only one in the room who was not affected by the
reading Only a slight tightening of her lips marred her careful
composure

Soon Walther lost himself in the tingling excitement of the room
and he forgot about watching the others Word by word sentence by
sentence the Digester led them along with Don Cervante

The reading with its many pauses for translation took almost two
hours When it was over everyone was emotionally and physically
exhausted The little Digester was so pale he looked ill his high
forehead dripped with perspiration

Walther drew a long breath and brought himself reluctantly back to
reality

Willy asked quietly

What do you think of our intellectual underworld

An outbreak of almost hysterical conversation made it useless for
Walther to answer Maria with a look of reproach at Willy moved
across the room to speak to their hostess Willy lit one of his cigars
and leaned closer to Walther There was a gleam of amusement in his
twinkling blue eyes

You look more worn out than Don Cervante he chuckled

The contrast between this evening and the disillusionment of the day
made it hard for Walther to put his gratitude into words

I cant thank you enough he began

Dont try said Willy I may have had my own devious reasons for
inviting you He glanced toward Maria who was making an effort at
polite conversation with the hostess Im afraid our young diva isnt
an ardent admirer of the unexpurgated Don Quixote

There were many questions Walther wanted to ask about Maria but he
tactfully inquired instead

How often does this group meet

Whenever there is something to sharea chapter of literaturea
copy of an old paintinga recording It all depends on what our few
Digester friends can manageThey dont have an easy time of it you
know

Is it difficult for them to take things out of the vaults

Difficult  and dangerous Willy answered grimly

But why

For reasons that make good sense officially at least A culture
founded on brevity cannot be expected to encourage its own demise
through the acts of its civil servants Think what could happen A
total work of art whatever its form takes time to appreciate But
if people spend too long at an opera the legitimate theatre or the
television industry would be slighted If they paused too long in
contemplation of a painting newspapers might not be purchased If they
dawdled over the oldstyle newspaper the digest magazines the popular
recordings the minute movies the spectator sportsthe thousand and
one forms of mass recreation offered the publiceach in turn would
suffer from unrestrained competition

Its inconceivable Walther protested that entertainment interests
could be strong enough to shape a culture Surely the productive basis
of Earths economy

Willy snorted

My boy work as such may still be important in Andromeda but how
could it possibly be so here on Earth Generations ago automation
the control of the atom the harnessing of the suns energyall
combined with many other factors to make work a negligible part of
Mans existence Thus with fourfifths of his waking hours devoted
to leisuretime pursuits the balance of power shifted inevitably to
the purveyors of mass entertainment Great monopolies operating under
the Happy Time Ltd cartel seized upon the digest trend in the old
culture and made brevity the basis of the new order The briefer you
make a piece of entertainment the more pieces you can sell the public
in a given number of leisure hours Its just good business Willy
concluded drily

Walther was silent a moment trying to frame this picture in his
thoughts But there were so many missing elements

Your artists and writers he demanded all your creative
peopledont they have anything to say about it

Damn little You see the successful artistwhatever his fieldis
well paid by his particular monopoly Besides hes been trained in
the new form I doubt if Maria has ever seen the original score of an
operalet alone tried to sing an entire aria

Willy took a glass of wine from a tray offered by the hostesss
servorobot He motioned to Walther to help himself but Walther shook
his head Another question was troubling him

Why do the monopolies even bother with Digesters and the classics Why
not let modern artists create in the new form

Willys voice grew hard

Because he snapped there have been no creative artists on Earth
for over a century Why create when your creation is only fed into the
maw of the Digesters That which is not wanted diesin a culture as
well as in the human body Thatmy young friend from Andromedais the
bitter tragedy of it all

Maria rejoined them and whispered something to Willy The old producer
sighed and turned to Walther

Maria would like to leave now Will you take her back to our hotel
There are some people here I must see

Of course

Yet in spite of his eagerness to get better acquainted with Maria
Walther was reluctant to leave There was so much more he wanted to
ask to learn And deep beneath the surface of his thoughts a bold idea
was beginning to form

As if reading his mind Willy said

We have no performance tomorrow afternoon Come and see me at our
hotelwell talk further Meanwhile Willys blue eyes sparkled
again Meanwhile for the young the evening is still young It should
be an interesting challenge

                                   

Maria said nothing until they had left the apartment building and
started across the street to the monorail station Then she stopped
drew a long breath of the wintry air and shook her head

Whtrblvng she exclaimed

She smiled at his puzzled expression and tucked her arm through his
When they were inside the station he handed her his Manual She
flipped through the pages but could not find the exact translation
of her remark Finally she picked out parts of three phrases Put
together they read

What a terrible evening

After the first shock of her words Walther realized he could expect
her to feel no differently She was a product of her culture and
evidently this had been her first visit to Willys Bohemia

It was past midnight when they boarded the monorail and they were
alone in the car Fumbling in her purse for a coin Maria pointed to
the small screen on the back of the seat in front of them Walther
offered a handful of coins She put one into the slot beside the
screen A comedy sequence appeared lasting for approximately thirty
seconds Much of it was lost to Walther because he couldnt understand
the dialogue But Maria laughed gaily The tension lines the outward
evidences of inner emotional control began to smooth away Her cheeks
flushed her dark eyes began to sparkle This was the Maria Walther
felt he could learn to know

When the television screen went dark Maria promptly put another coin
into a slot beside a small grid A fullscale orchestra sounded what
might have been the first chord of a symphony but the piece was over
before Walther could identify it A third coin dropped into the arm
of the seat produced a small twopage magazine which seemed to
consist chiefly of pictures One of the pictures showed Maria herself
in operatic costume She studied it critically then tossed the
magazine into a handy receptacle under the seat A fourth coin brought
out a game from the side of the monorail car It vaguely resembled
a checkerboard except that there were only six squares and two
magnetized checkers Maria guided his hand while he made two moves As
she completed her last move the board automatically folded back into
the side of the car A fifth coin summoned a miniature keyboard from
just beneath the television screen Maria touched the keys producing
tinkling noises that sounded like a tiny celeste Then the keyboard
zipped back into its enclosure

Maria reached for a sixth coin Walther closed his hand over hers and
made a motion to indicate that his head was already in a whirl She
laughed but didnt try to remove her hand A moment later the monorail
stopped in front of their hotel

As they crossed the lobby Walther pointed inquiringly toward the
cocktail lounge Maria smiled and nodded gaily

A servorobot waiter seated them at a small chrome table beside a tiny
dance floor Maria ordered their drinks and the waiter was back with
them in a matter of seconds The glasses seemed extremely small to
Walther compared to the huge mugs and steins he was accustomed to on
Neustadt The liquor tasted rather bland more like a sweet wine than a
whiskey

The servorobot presented a bill with the drinks Money had never
meant anything to Walther but he could scarcely repress a start when
he deciphered the amount of the bill By any standard of wealth or
exchange the drinks were fantastically expensive

A scattering of applause announced the return of the orchestra Maria
held out her hand in an invitation to Walther With some misgivings
he led her out on the dance floor She turned and came into his arms
so naturally and suddenly that she almost took his breath away She
danced very close to him Her cheek was warm and the faint perfume
from the tip of her ear was something he would have liked to explore
more thoroughly But the moment was over before it began The music
stopped the orchestra leader bowed and led his men from the stage

Back at the table Walther lifted his glass to suggest another drink
She shook her head explaining

Olndrptd

Spelled out with his Manual her explanation was

Only one drink is permitted

And after Willys brief orientation this was understandable Nothing
could disrupt the perpetual entertainment cycles more easily than
excessive drinking A tipsy person was not a good customer for other
leisuretime activities Therefore permit only one drink to a person
and charge enough for it so that the liquor monopoly would get its fair
share of the entertainment expenditure As Willy would say it was just
good business

Maria touched his hand to signify it was time to leave Walther took
her up to her room on the nd floor and they watched two musical
comedies en route on the elevator payasyousee television screen

In front of her door Maria lightly touched the back of his hand with
her fingertips She said

Thyfrwrdrftm

Walther knew she was thanking him but from force of newlyacquired
habit he reached for his Manual

She laughed shook her head and translated her own words by raising up
on tiptoe and brushing his lips with her own

Their lips were together so briefly that Walther wasnt sure whether
he had really kissed her He reached out to take her in his arms and
make sure of it

Deftly she turned away and closed her door behind her

                                   

Many thoughts interfered with Walthers second night of sleep on Earth
and they werent only of Maria In fact as his idea took form even
the scent of her perfume and the mothlike touch of her lips were
forced temporarily into the background of his consciousness

The next morning he waited impatiently for an hour after breakfast
then went up to Willys room Willy came to the door in his dressing
robe holding his glasses in one hand and a sheet of music in the
other He waved aside Walthers apology for not waiting until afternoon

Nein  nein he said I ordered an extra pot of coffeebecause I
didnt think you could wait

Willy led Walther into his sitting room and poured him some coffee

Maria was already here he chuckled She came to  ah  pick up
music  and to ask what I know about you I told her nothing good
and nothing bad

He settled himself in his easy chair with a luxurious sigh His
bristling white hair and cherubic cheeks gave him the appearance of a
benign old innkeeper brought to life from a canvas by Holbein

All right tell me what youve been thinking about all night

Walther shifted tensely to the edge of his chair He spilled a little
coffee in setting his cup down

I would like to buy copies he said of everything your Digester
friends have ever smuggled out of the vaults

Thats a large order my young friend

Ill pay  whatever it costs

So would Iif I could afford it But I fear its not that simple
Take for example the chapter of Don Quixote you heard last evening
The World Government representative from England sent the Digesters
notes to an aunt in Liverpool Shell read them to her Bohemian friends
tonight and tomorrow they may be in Buenos Aires or Istanbulwho
knows

But what happens to them eventually Arent they kept in some central
place

Willy spread his short pudgy fingers in a gesture of hopelessness

That would mean organizationand were not organized We wouldnt
dare to be Ive never stopped to think what finally happens to these
things Perhaps they end up among the papers of some old dreamer like
myself Its enough that they have brought their mellow moments of
happiness

Its not enough Walther protested fiercely Its a great waste How
will you ever improve things that way

Whos trying to improve anything The people of Earth are contentand
those of us who are not entirely sowell we have our little
underworlds of pleasure

Is that all you want

Is there more

Walther jumped up angrily

I believe there isand I think you do too he said harshly If you
dont why did you take me to that meeting last night and invite me
here today Why did you send me off alone with Maria

Willy only smiled but under his silk robe his round belly shook with
silent laughter

You are a foolish young man  and sometimes not so foolish Sit
down Sit down

He leaned forward in his easy chair and his manner became grave

Perhaps its difficult for an old man to come near the end of life
fearing that the beauty he loves will never escape from its tomb
Perhaps its also difficult for an old maestro who cherishes the talent
and loveliness of a young woman to know that she may never understand
what her gift really means Perhaps an old man can still dream some
dreams that a young man could not comprehend

The tight knot in Walthers stomach slowly unwound itself

Then you will help me he said quietly

Yes I will help you  if I can  and you will help me

At Willys suggestion they decided to talk first to the Digester who
had smuggled out the Don Quixote chapter

Hes been most successful of all of our friends said Willy He
might be willing to organize a group of Digesters who could bring out
things to be duplicated and return them I question though that you
could duplicate many things here on Earth

Then well ship them away from Earth The outermost world of this
galaxyat least to my knowledgeis Alden IV its technically
welldeveloped and is a contact with our own galaxy

Willy called the bald little Digester and he came over right after
lunch But his reaction to Walthers proposal was not what they had
expected

This  this is a terrible mistake he stammered Its  its
too bigmuch too big Nowby being cautiouswe can enjoy our little
evenings together But if we anger the Happy Time Ltd people well
lose everything

Willy snapped his fingers impatiently

What have we to lose A chance to be teacup rebels This young man
is giving us an opportunity to do something about what we profess to
believe

The Digester looked pained

We are already doing something he protested Did I not bring
Chapter IX of Don Quixote

You did and we enjoyed it But what if we could inspire a rebirth of
art as big as a whole galaxy instead of entertaining each other with
our little flings at Bohemia

The little Digester struggled with the thought for a moment then
dismissed it with a shudder

Its too big he repeated miserably Please forget about it
Willyour own way is best He glared at Walther and his distress
turned to rage I warn you young man  dont start trouble for us
If you cant accept the ways of Earth go back where you belong

He held out a trembling hand to Willy

Goodby Willy  I go now He hesitated then added with the wistful
air of a small boy waiting to be praised In two weeks I will bring
another whole chapter to read

When Willy only shrugged the little Digester turned away and sadly
left the room

During the next two days Willy contacted several other Digester
friends In varying degrees he met with refusals from each By the end
of the week only two of the younger Digesters in the Bohemian set had
agreed to cooperate and even they were careful not to promise too much

At this rate Walther pointed out glumly it will take years to
collect any real quantity of materialand I have only six months Is
there no other source

Willy shook his head

None that I know of

There must be Walther insisted Do you mean to tell me that in all
the homes of Earth there are no treasured heirlooms of the past No
books No paintings No recordings

Oh Im sure they are Willy agreed But how to reach them We can
hardly advertise

He paused hesitated then snapped his fingers

Waitthere may be a wayeven more illegal than your first
suggestion but still a way

What is it

I used the word underworld in speaking of our Bohemian group last
night but actually there is an underworld of a sort  trafficking
mostly in liquor The cartels onedrink restriction has never been too
enforceable Willy lifted the seat of his piano bench and took out a
bottle If you can afford it you can always buy a bootleg supply

Whats liquor got to do with art

For a pricethe underworld may be willing to traffic in art
literature and music  in addition to alcohol

Willy sent out word through a bootlegger who supplied some of the
opera singers with their favorite beverages The next night after
final curtain a greying bespectacled and very distinguished looking
gentleman in formal dress met Willy and Walther in a vacant dressing
room backstage He spoke tersely and Willy translated

He says he has friends who could be interested in your proposition if
theres money enough in it

Tell him theres money enough Walther replied grimly

Willy digested this and their visitor smiled his scepticism

Not accustomed to having his financial standing questioned Walther
faced the man himself and demanded

How much money do you want

The man understood Walthers tone if not his words After a brief
calculation he named a price that shocked Willy who turned to Walther
with dismay

Ten thousand credits for every usable piece of art that can be bought
outright An additional deposit of ten thousand if it has to be sent
away from Earth to be duplicated You are to pay all shipping costs as
well as legal expenses if any of their men are arrested

Walther accepted the terms with a nod

Their underworld contact stared respectfully at Walther took off
his suede gloves and proceeded to get down to business It was soon
arranged for Walther to set up letters of credit in banks of all major
cities Shipments of tools and machinery would be billed against
these credits after bills of lading had been inspected by Walther or a
designated representative From the level of the discussion they might
have been transacting legal business on a corporation scale

Their visitor shook hands with each of them doffed his top hat and
left with a courteous bow

Willy wiped shining beads of sweat from his forehead

High finance he gasped is not a part of my daily routine

He dug into a wardrobe trunk brought out a bottle and poured two
drinks Raising his glass high in the air he toasted

To art  and crime I hope we dont have to pay too much for either

                                   

How are you getting along with Maria Willy asked a few days later

Just what do you expect to accomplish by throwing the two of us
together so much Walther asked bluntly Oh I enjoy it mind
youbut really were worlds apart When I go back

With the young everything is possibleeven the impossible Willy
answered evasively

Well tell me something more about her Where does she come from Has
she ever been engaged Married

Willy filtered a cloud of smoke through his nostrils

Marias the only talented offspring ever produced by a rather poor
family in Naples She still supports themor rather makes it possible
for them to be good Happy Time consumers As for her talent  well
it was discovered by her first school teacherand from then on her
education was taken over by the opera monopoly Engaged Nothing
serious that I know of Married Willy frowned I shudder to think of
her marriage to one of our mechanical young rabbits

Walther blinked

Do you mind explaining that one

Willy grimaced

I might as well You see sex per se is encouraged with or without
the formality of marriage Large numbers of offspring are good for
society We have the technology to provide for them and the more there
are the more potential Happy Time consumers But the arts of sex 
the refinements of love Cant you imagine by this time what takes
place in the boudoirs of Earth Sex is something to be accommodated
between payasyou see television programs Besides youve encountered
a couple of our young men do you consider them physically capable of
prolonged amour

Walther was finding it heavy going to picture some of the things Willy
was describing for him But the mention of the two young men he had
met outside the opera that first night brought up a question hed been
waiting to ask

What was wrong with them I barely touched them

Participation sportsphysical activity of any kind is discouraged as
interfering with the mass entertainment media The few gifted boys are
trained to be professionals The others scarcely develop enough muscle
to walk against a strong wind In fact they dont walk any more than
is necessary

Willy paced agitatedly around his room and stopped in front of
Walthers chair He held out his hands pleadingly

Be patient with Maria he begged You promised to help me too 
and this is all I ask of you

Walther didnt find it unpleasant to comply with Willys request He
had nothing to do while waiting for the first shipment to be assembled
and so was able to attend rehearsals as well as the performances of the
operas

At rehearsals he saw a serious Maria a perfectionist devoted to her
art a superb technician After rehearsals and the opera itself he
saw a Maria who was a product of the alien leisuretime culture he
had found on Eartha Maria who flitted with tireless zest from one
activity to another who naturally and enthusiastically accepted the
innumerable forms of entertainment offered by the Happy Time cartel

With growing despair Walther tried to find some activity they could
share He had always enjoyed sports so he took her to all the
attractions at the Uniport arenas Each was a new disappointment
What was billed as a fight for the worlds heavyweight title ended
with a oneround decision A basketball game was excitingfor three
furiouslycontested minutes The professional tennis match consisted of
each player serving four balls which the other attempted to return

While traveling to and from the various attractions there were always
the diversions offered on the monorail and stratoway cars Private
transportation Walther learned after hopefully exploring this
possibility had been eliminated for the obvious reason that it was
restricted in the number of recreational opportunities it permitted
and might lead to overindulgence in sexfrom the point of view of
the time involved rather than promiscuity And while walking was not
strictly illegal those who tended to overindulge were advised to
curtail their eccentricity

After much thought Walther did hit upon a possibility It was prompted
by his recollection that the natural beauty of such places as the
Vienna woods had not been obscured Since Maria was not required to be
at rehearsals until two in the afternoon they could spend the morning
visiting some distant beauty spots he had read or heard about back on
Neustadt Perhaps in some of these places the pace of leisure would be
slowed

Maria happily accepted his initial invitation to spend a morning in
the South Sea Islands They boarded a stratoway car immediately after
breakfasting together at the hotel and soon had exchanged chilly
Uniport for languorous Tahiti

The island village the natives and their costumes the wet fragrance
of the jungle and the soft rippling of the surf were all as Walther had
pictured them since his first reading of Stevensons voyages to the
South Seas

However suspecting that the Happy Time cartel had probably made its
presence felt in the village itself Walther steered Maria around it
toward a path that wound invitingly between the tall palms and growths
of bread fruit trees

Marias hand fell easily naturally into his own and she pressed a
little closer to him as if awed by the unaccustomed stillness

She smiled up at him started to say something but Walther put his
finger over her lips and shook his head Maria looked puzzled then
took out of her handbag a miniaturized selfpowered television set
with its own tiny coin meter She popped in a coin flicked the dial
and the image of an actor appeared on the screen Walther covered it
with his hand He took the set away from her and dropped it into the
pocket of his coat Then he pointed to her to the shadowed trees
around themand spread his hands as if to ask what more anyone could
possibly want

He wasnt sure she understood but he put his arm around her waist and
she rested her head against his shoulder They continued a dozen steps
down the path until it ended at a silvery lagoon Here she touched
the radio button of her wristwatchrented on a weekly basisand the
rhythm of a jazz band filled the tropical air

Walther took her wrist shut off the radio He turned her toward him
and held her face tightly between the palms of his hands

No television he said firmly No radiono nothingexcept this

She yielded with a faint smile Her eyes closed but their lips had
scarcely touched when she tried to draw back

Not that way Walther told her This way

He held her face firmly teaching her the kind of kisses that were used
in a frontier world where people had time to make love She struggled
away from the unnaturalness of his kissing then slowly she ceased to
struggle

Suddenly the lagoon was lighted by a brilliant spotlight and a
servorobot stepped out of the shadows It said pleasantly

Since only tourists come to this spot it is presumed that you come
from some distant planet Therefore let me point out that all couples
are limited to two minutes by the lagoon If you hurry you can catch a
native dance number before the next stratoway leaves

In the same pleasant tone the servorobot began to repeat these words
in the other ancient languages of Earth

Marias breath came in short trembling gasps Her lips were still
apart and she touched them with the tip of her tongue

Weil nur Touristen nach diesem Fleckchen Erde kommen  the
servorobot droned along in its pleasing voice

Oh shut up Walther growled

He took Maria by the arm and led her back up the path

Somehow he promised her fervently Somewherewere going to finish
that

Dthgn she whispered in breathless wonder

                                   

The first shipment of tools and machinery had been assembled at the
Uniport landing Walther received a formal notice to this effect from
the local Exchange Bank The same evening in a backstage dressing
room he and Willy Fritsh received a rather more informative report
from the gentleman who was their contact with the bootleg underworld
Every item in the shipment was listed and described with meticulous
care By reference to a leatherbound pocket notebook the contact
managed to furnish additional details

With Willys help Walther was able to judge the nature of the haul
He was both pleased and disappointed Numerically it had more items
than he had expected Qualitatively it left much to be desired There
were no complete literary works only fragments The pictures were
admittedly cheap copies the recordings were only passages from major
works A total of eight hundred items had been purchased outright
by underworld agents fourteen hundred more had been borrowed on the
security of the huge deposit The latter would have to be duplicated
on Alden IV and returned to their Earth owners as quickly as possible
Walther had expended a huge fortune for a dubious return But through
Willy he told the contact

Keep it up Get everything you can

Several items did look promising From an elderly spinster in Durban
South Africa the first two acts of Othello had been obtained by
the bootlegger who delivered her dry sec sherry twice a month in
New Orleans an undertaker had parted with a nearly complete Louis
Armstrong originalabout an inch was broken off one edge of the
record but the bill of lading stated that the rest was quite audible
There was also what was reported to be the last third of Crime and
Punishment loaned by a lawyer in Prague

The second shipment was on a par with the first with the hopeful
indication that some of the new acquisitions would complement others in
the first shipment Walther stood beside Willy at the Uniport landing
as the shuttleship carrying their second shipment blasted off on the
first leg of the long route to faroff Alden IV

The third shipment was much smaller only three hundred outright
purchases and seven hundred and twenty items obtained against deposit
With the bill of lading came a warning note Walther translated it
himself It was from their contact who wrote

Dont try to get in touch with me until further notice Send off this
shipment as soon as possible The Happy Time boys know something big is
going on

By paying a fabulous premium Walther was able to get the third
shipment off on the midnight shuttle Afterwards he stood in the window
of Willys hotel room staring up at the starfilled sky

Well that may be the end of it he said

Youve done well said Willy joining him I didnt think youd get
that much

I hope itll do some good Perhaps all this new material will at least
form the basis of a good research library

Willy glanced at him speculatively

I was disappointed about the music he said Not one complete work

By this time Walther had learned to know when Willy was maneuvering
toward an objective

Just tell me what youve got in mind he grinned No preliminaries

Willy chuckled his appreciation then grew serious

Our opera season ends this week Were supposed to take a month
off then start rehearsals for the next tour Perhaps during this
month

Walther sensed what was coming next but he held his breathwaiting
for Willy to say it Willy did

Perhapsif you still want to spend more money to pay themwe could
persuade some of our group to record

A fulllength opera Walther exclaimed Would theycould theydo
it

Willy pursed his lips thoughtfully

As for willingnessyouve observed that your wealth is rather
persuasive on Earth Like most artists our people spend more than they
earn and would probably try anything for what you could pay them As
for abilitywed undoubtedly have to record in short sessions We
might even have to break up the arias into sections because were not
conditioned for sustained effort

Ill pay them anything to try it Walther broke in enthusiastically
Where would you try ithere in Uniport

Hardly But theres an old inn in North Wales where I once spent a
vacation with some of our group If the Happy Time agents should be
watching us now it would be quite natural to return to that inn

Maria  do you think she would

Willy sighed and shrugged

Not for the money alone  shes quite a perfectionist about her art
But Im hopeful that by this time His eyes twinkled

Walther laughed

What a chess player you would make I think youve been moving me
around like a pawn ever since the first evening we met

Not a pawn Willy corrected him with a smile A knight

However they decided not to tell Maria the real purpose of the
proposed vacation until they were all set up at the inn in North
Wales Walther thought the setting sounded perfect for some personal
unfinished business

Even I could sing an aria in such a place Willy enthused

Willy began quietly and individually contacting other members of his
company With the kind of payment Walther authorized him to offer
he had little difficulty getting performers for the venture Most of
them thought the project ridiculous but the money was more than they
would normally earn in an entire season Willy swore each of them to
silence They were to treat the trip as nothing more than a vacation
He made arrangements for the various pieces of recording equipment to
be shipped separately from London Berlin and New York

Willys pink cheeks were perpetually flushed these days and his bright
eyes sparkled brighter than ever When Walther brought up the question
of which opera would be attempted he discovered that the shrewd old
maestro had long ago acquired Puccinis complete Madame Butterfly and
had already packed the music for shipment to North Wales

The night before they were to leave Uniport a familiar distinguished
figure appeared backstage threading his way between the huge crates
being packed by the servorobot stagehands Willy led him immediately
to one of the dressing rooms

With admirable simplicity the underworld contact put a proposition
before them

The first three shipments had pretty well exhausted the supply of
readily obtainable material With the Happy Time agents now alerted
the risk of trying to get more material wasnt justified by the
probable results But the underworld wasnt anxious to let go of a good
revenue source without one big payoff

What did they propose to do

Willys voice shook as he translated

Forfor the rightfeetheyre willing to break into the Uniport
Library vaults

Walther was silent for a long moment Instinctively he recoiled from
such overt action But reason asked Why should he draw back now
Everything taken from the vaults would be duplicated and returned in
good condition Was it right to let his own personal reaction stand in
the way of something that might benefit whole ages of Mankind

When he had firm control of his own voice he nodded and asked

How do they propose to do it

The plan was a piece of professional craftsmanship In the century
of its existence no one had ever attempted to enter the new library
illegally With the absence of any known motive for doing so the need
for guarding against it was routine There were the usual doors and
timelocks the alarm systems and servorobot guards but nothing that
couldnt be handled They would bring in technicians from Vega VI to
handle the timelocks Otherwise barring some unsuspected move by the
Happy Time security police the job was within the bounds of their own
abilities Of course there must be meticulous attention to detail and
planning

The contact explained that according to preliminary surveys they
could count on about two hours of work after gaining entrance to
the vaults By concentrating only on books for speed of handling
and packing a reasonable sized crew should be able to get at least
twenty thousand volumes out of the vaults and into a waiting monorail
transport where the crates would already be assembled Previous
arrangements could be made for the midnight freight shuttle to take the
crates from the Uniport landing to Cyngus III From there the crates
could be dispersed throughout the immeasurable reaches of deep space

But they must be returned Walther insisted Ill see to that

Their visitor shrugged indicating that this detail was of no interest
to him He named a price and when Walther promptly agreed to it Willy
poured them all a drink

When I was a small boy Willy said in a voice that still trembled
I slid on the seat of my trousers down an icy slope in the Alps It
was good fun for the first twenty yards and then I realized I had gone
beyond my power to stop Thats the way I feel right now Prosit

As their caller started to leave Walther stopped him by raising his
hand Throughout the discussion an irresistible compulsion had been
growing within him Now he had to speak

Ive come a long way he told Willy Granting that nothing goes
wrong and that Im able to leave I know Ill never return to Earth
again But theres one selfish personal thing I want to do before
leaving It isnt sensible I knowbut neither was my dream to begin
with I want to go with these men into the Uniport vaultsjust to see
for an hourgreater treasures than I can ever hope to see again

                                   

From his room on the second floor of the Bridge End Inn Walther
could look down upon the River Dee tumbling along beside what was
still called the Shropshire and Union Railroad Canal although the
tracks of that ancient railroad had been torn up centuries ago Old
ways and names had a way of persisting in North Wales despite the
pace of modern leisure Walther had noted with satisfaction that the
double consonants of the old language with their strange throaty
pronunciation had defied contraction Llangollen and Llantysilio were
two nearby cities whose names were still spelled out as they had been
for a thousand years

He glanced at his watch Maria should be waking from her nap just
about now In a half hour Willy wanted to meet with her and ask her
cooperation in doing Madame Butterfly Walther had suggested waiting
until the next day since Maria was tired from the closing night
festivities in Uniport and from packing the rest of the night in time
to catch the morning stratoway But Willy opposed delay

As he stood there by his window Walther had a sense of peace for the
first time since hed been on Earth The moment was all the more to be
cherished since he knew it could not last

A light knock on his door jarred the view and the peace out of focus

Come in he called and turned expecting to see Willy

But it was Maria who entered looking remarkably refreshed after
her short nap She wore a sweater a very short skirt and opentoed
sandals Her long dark hair was combed out loose

It was the first time he had seen her dressed so casually She looked
more like a Welsh mountain girl than the star of the Uniport opera

Hi he said inadequately

She laughed at his surprise and put her arms around him

Hi she answered

Maria had not forgotten her first lesson beside the Tahiti lagoon and
Walther was reviewing some subsequent lessons when both of them became
aware of the unwelcome fact that they were not alone

Willy Fritsh stood in the doorway smiling benignly

Oh hell said Walther

Believe me I didnt intend to interrupt Willy said happily But
since were all together right now  under such  ah  propitious
circumstances suppose we talk things over

Later said Walther

Ignoring his protest Willy sat himself comfortably on the window seat
opened a large envelope and took out the bound libretto of Madame
Butterfly He handed it to Maria without comment She stared at it
curiously but made no move to open it until Willy motioned her to do
so

She nodded with recognition at the title page then as she riffled
through succeeding pages her expression changed from surprise to
distaste She tried to hand the libretto back to Willy but instead of
taking it he drew her to the window seat beside him and spoke to her
as a father might speak to his daughter

By this time Walther could understand a little of what Willy was
saying and he could guess the rest of it Marias first reaction was to
stare incredulously at Willy As the full meaning of what he was asking
became clear to her she looked up at Walther He saw scorn and anger
in her dark eyes

When she looked back at Willy it was to shake her head in emphatic
refusal

Willys tone became even more persuasive He gazed out the window as he
spoke down at the river pouring over the weir and ducking under the
old stone bridge Maria rolled the libretto into a tight scroll Her
fingers showed white through her unpolished nails

Willy stopped abruptly He looked older tired Maria remained silent
her lips compressed into a tight line At last she answered him in a
voice that was tightly coldly controlled

She stood up and walked toward the door Walther held out his hand she
ignored it He started after her and Willy said

Let her go

Willy looked so depressed that Walther felt a need to comfort him

Its all right he said Well forget the whole idea

Willy shook his head

Shell do it he said wearily

But

Shell do it because she thinks she owes it to me

Walther waited for the old maestro to continue

As soon as were through recording Willy went on pushing himself
up from the window seat Maria wants to be released to another opera
company

Ill go see her right now Walther began

Not now Willy interrupted She wouldnt have anything to do with
you She thinks your only interest has been this recording

                                   

Willy started rehearsals early the next morning in the big stone barn
behind the inn The structures high roof and thick walls provided
natural acoustics while its location was far enough from Llangollen
to avoid creating undue curiosity Recording equipment had been set up
along one side around it the orchestra was grouped The center area
was marked off for vocal rehearsals

Willy handled the direction himself and not for a century had any
director on Earth undertaken such a staggering task

From the first moments of rehearsal it became evident that the
orchestra could never hope to play an entire number in one sustained
effort It was not so much the physical effort involved as the
difficulty of maintaining an emotional crest for so long a period The
first violinist fainted halfway through the opening sequence between
Lieutenant Pinkerton and the American consul This triggered a mass
collapse among the woodwinds The pianist wavered off an octave through
sheer fatigue and the drummer dropped his sticks when Willy cued him
to step up tempo

Willy was frantic

Well have to record a few bars at a timeuntil theyre more
accustomed to the strain he told Walther What an editing job this
will be

The problem with the vocalists was even more acute Every duet would
have to be recorded in at least ten segments

Maria was the only one who stubbornly insisted on doing a complete
number It was a point of pride with her She hated the music it
violated every principle she had ever learned But the perfectionist
in her reinforced by her bitterness toward Walther and her sense of
obligation to Willy drove her to deliver the full measure of her
promise

In the love duet between Butterfly and Pinkerton which closed Act I
the pale and perspiring Pinkerton was nearly spent as he began his
final lines

    Come then

    Love what fear holds you trembling

    Have done with all misgivings

His impassioned plea quavered he clutched Marias arm to steady
himself Willy cut the music For five minutes they held cold
compresses to the singers wrists while members of the orchestra
slumped exhausted in their chairs When all were somewhat recovered
Pinkerton attempted the next two lines of his wedding night rapture

    The night doth enfold us

    See the world lies sleeping

    And then he had to rest again

But when Maria answered her dark eyes flashing defiantly she went
through her entire eight lines without a pause

Her great test came with the famous second act solo One Fine Day
It was difficult enough to learn the strange words and music but to
achieve and hold the emotional peaks of the solo for nearly two minutes
was something she had never before attempted

Because she insisted on doing the entire aria without resting Willy
set the recording for early in the morning when the orchestra would be
fresh He asked them to assemble on the improvised sound stage an hour
after breakfast

Willy limited the orchestra to a minimum tune up period so that the
musicians could conserve their energies for the ordeal ahead The
violins were the last to be ready When the final string had been
tuned Willy cued the engineers to stand by and pointed the tip of his
baton toward Maria

    Un Bel Di

The words came clear as the notes of a silver bell calling back to
life the beauty that had been dead for so long Walther felt his
stomach muscles tighten a tingle of wonder crept up his spine

Standing there in the center of the old stone barn wearing only
sandals shorts and a light blouse open at the neck Maria still
managed to convey the feelings of the lonely young Japanese wife who
sang so confidently of her husbands return from across the sea

This was Maria the incomparable artist using all of her technique to
blend the unfamiliar words and music

But for the first few lines it was only a technical tour de force Then
Puccinis music began to take hold of Maria merging the artist with
the woman and creating yet a third entity out of the two

He saw Willy turn transfixed toward Maria His hands and baton
continued to move but not by conscious direction His pink cheeks were
pale etched with deepening lines His blue eyes were misted

Even the other members of the company seemed moved by Marias
performance Yet they could not stay with her emotionally they
were compelled to break the tension by shuffling their feet and
selfconsciously lighting cigarettes

To a man the orchestra played as if hypnotized sweeping through
measure after measure with an intensity that seemed impossible to
maintain

For an uncertain moment near the end of the aria it looked as if
Maria could not finish She swayed held tightly to the microphone
for support Walther stepped forward to catch her but she recovered
drawing on some inner source of strength to finish

     This will all come to pass as I tell you

    Banish your idle fears 

    For he will return I know it

As Maria finished she tore herself away from the microphone Her lips
were trembling her eyes were wide like those of a woman in shock She
halfran out of the barn stoppedconfusedin the bright sunlight
and then ran on down the path toward the Inn

                                   

Until late afternoon Maria would see no one Then she agreed to see
Willy for a few moments

When the old maestro left her room he looked deeply troubled

I dont know  he told Walther shaking his head I dont know
what this has done to her

What did she say

Right now she says she will never sing again Shes going to her home
in Italy this evening

Can we do anything

Looks like weve already done more than we should Mixing two cultures
in one artist is dangerous chemistry

Up to this moment Walther had deliberately avoided any decision about
Maria She had been a continuing and delightful challenge especially
since Tahiti but beyond that he had not allowed his thoughts to go
Now there was a responsibility he could no longer evade He had watched
the dual personality that was Maria being shattered under the impact
of Puccinis music How would the pieces fit together again Should
he stand by and watch Or should he try to help And if he could
help her how would it all end The gulf between two cultures could
be wider than the mathematics of space between two galaxies or the
bridging power of sex

Against Willys advice Walther decided to catch the same stratoway
with Maria and take his chances on what might happen

But a phone call from Uniport abruptly changed his plans It was
from their underworld contact who informed Willy that the Board of
Directors was meeting that evening if Walther wanted to attend he
would have to take the next stratoway to Uniport Someone would meet
him at the station

Uniport or Italy Willy intervened to make the decision easier

This will be your only chance to get into the vaults he counseled
Besides Maria must think some things through for herself

His emotions in turmoil Walther boarded the next stratoway for
Uniport As North Wales and England blurred into the ocean beneath him
he had the feeling that he would never see the River Dee country again

A tall thin young man with eyes as colorless as waxpaper met him
at the Uniport station and hurried him into a monorail car Walther
tentatively began a question but the young man stopped him with an
opaque stare

Four times they changed monorail cars ending up eventually at a
freight terminal where an older man met them and pointed silently
to one of the freight cars Inside Walther saw a strange assortment
of smiling servorobots and grimfaced humans sitting around on
empty packing cases The cases were already marked for shipment and
transshipment throughout the galaxy

After quick sharp glances of appraisal no one paid any attention to
him He sat down beside one of the servorobots and forced himself to
wait as patiently as possible For a half hour nothing happened The
servorobots remained motionless the humans chainsmoked until the air
in the freight car was an acrid grey smog Nearly every human switched
constantly and nervously from his tiny TV set to his watchradio
One of the men brought out a bottle but quickly put it away after a
staccato command from the greying squarejawed man who seemed to be in
charge

At  oclock without warning the freight car vibrated slightly and
began to move The servorobots stood up attentively the humans
snuffed out their cigarettes Peering through one of the small windows
Walther saw that twilight was merging into night

It was completely dark when the car stopped at a loading platform
behind the steelgrey building that towered above the Uniport cultural
vaults A servorobot guard stepped forward challengingly

At a gesture from the leader one of the servorobots within the car
marched out on the platform and presented a punched bill of lading As
the guard fed the document into its tabulator the other stepped closer
and lightly brushed against it The guard stiffened as though from a
severe shock There was a sound like that of a racing motor suddenly
thrown out of gear Then a click and silence The servorobot guard
unhinged itself at the knees and collapsed on the platform

Another signal from the leader and out of the car scurried the humans
and servorobots They ran across the platform toward the shadow of the
building Here two of the men who Walther guessed to be the experts
imported to Earth for this job traced a circle around the door with an
instrument that resembled a small camera Evidently this was to cut off
the alarm system for almost immediately they relaxed and went on to
open the door without any attempt at caution

Proceeding in single file lighting their way with powerful
flashlights they passed in similar manner through a series of inner
doors to an elevator leading down into the vaults A servorobot took
over its operation and they shot downward At each level the leader
stepped off the elevator to look around At the sixth level he nodded
and they followed him into the vault

This was the book vault Tier upon tier the stacks of books reached in
every direction as far as a flashlight beam could probe

Motioning Walther to follow him the leader took a piece of chalk and
began marking off groups of books The men rounded up library carts for
the servorobots who swiftly fell to loading the carts and trundling
them back to the elevator

Walther soon moved ahead of the leader and began marking the books
himself They had started in the Msections With mounting excitement
Walther chalked off Machiavelli Mann Markham Masefield Maugham
Maupassant Melville Millay Moliere

Leaping to the next tier he raced through the stacks marking the works
of Nathan and Newton ONeill  Ovid Then on to Parker Pater
Pepys Plato Poe Racine Rousseau Sandburg  Santayana

What an astounding haul this would be The masterpieces of the ages
to be whisked across space from star system to star system until at
last they reached his homeland where they would grow and multiply a
millionfold generation into generation down through the millenniums
of universal time

Back to the Asections Adams Aeschylus Anderson Aristotle

On to the Bsections Bacon  Balzac  Benet  Bronte 
Byron

It was like drinking a heady burgundy Each new title whetted his taste
for more

Inevitably the very magnitude of the thing began to have its sobering
effect Was it actually possible to get so much material out of the
vaults Off the Earth

The leader caught up with him in the Ksections and motioned him not to
mark off any more books Theyd have a hard time getting those Walther
had already chalked

Walther rode up with the next elevator load On the way down he
indicated to the servorobot that he wanted to go all the way to the
bottom level There he stepped out of the elevator and stood in the
darkness for a moment to steady himself from the excitement of marking
so many books

Then he swept his flashlight beam slowly around the vault

It was like turning on a light in a tomb that had been sealed for
centuries Certainly this tomb had been sealed to all except the
Digesters and the servorobot attendants

The vault was at least two hundred feet high Walther could only guess
at the other dimensions and the extent of the corridors that fanned
out like the spokes of a wheel Sculptured figures from all the ages of
Earth loomed out of the shadows with a quality of arrested life that
might at any moment move again

The figures of the Pharaohs were here the chiseled perfection of
Athens and Rome the genius of the Renaissance and the primitive gods
of the Aztecs The armless Venus gazed down dispassionately on the
bowed back of the Discus Thrower while Rodins Thinker stared in
eternal contemplation at the belly of Buddha

And then Walther looked upward

High overhead reassembled on a great oblong span of artificial ceiling
suspended from the top of the vault were the nine immortal panels from
the Sistine Chapel Tracing his beam of light through scene by scene of
Michaelangelos creation of the world lingering among the connective
figures of the prophets and sibyls the lunettes and triangles
Walther lost all sense of time

When his back and neck muscles could stand the strain no longer he
wandered deeper into the dim recesses of the vault following corridor
after corridor entranced He was like a condemned man watching his
last sunrise and trying to absorb it all knowing he would not come
this way again

Walther did not realize how far he had wandered until he came at last
to the end of a corridor and glanced at his watch

Ten oclock

Hed been gone from the group for nearly three hours and the entire
raid had been timed for two hours

He started running for the elevator Corridor led into corridor
gallery into gallery It took him twenty minutes to find his way back
to the main vault another five minutes to locate the right elevator
He pressed the button and listened There was no sound within the shaft

He shouted and there was only the echo of his own voice reverberating
through the ages around him

                                   

Fighting down a flutter of panic Walther turned off his light and
leaned against the elevator door to organize his thoughts

He was sure the others had left on time to make shipment schedules
at the Uniport landing They might have delayed long enough to make
a cursory search for him but his safety was no part of their
commitment They had successfully raided the vaults which was all they
had contracted to do Before morning most of them undoubtedly would
have embarked on interplanetary cruises

Walthers first decision was to try the other elevators on the
offchance that one had been left in operating gear

None had

Next he set off to look for a stair well fire ladder or other
method of exit It took him three hours to cover the entire vault and
its corridors No doubt of it the elevators were the only means of
entering and leaving

It was now one oclock In eight hours the upper level doors would open
to the Digesters No particular effort had been made to camouflage the
gaps in the stacks His one chance was to reach the street level before
anyone noticed the missing books Meanwhile he could do nothing except
spend the night as comfortably as possible He spread his coat on the
marble floor behind the squat statue of a Malayan goddess

Surprisingly he did doze off toward morning He awoke shortly after
eight oclock and began to punch the elevator button every five
minutes Finally at three minutes to nine a faint hum responded
within the shaft He retreated hastily into the nearest corridor and
waited another ten minutes before bringing the elevator down to his
level Then he entered it pressed the streetlevel control and shot
upward

He lit a cigarette and was prepared to step out nonchalantly as soon
as the door opened

His exit was nonchalant enough but the servorobot guard in front of
the elevator held out its tabulator slot and said

Crdpls

Walther was shaken but did not freeze up He fumbled in his pocket for
a slip of paper and tried to cram it into the tabulator A red light
flashed on the servorobots chest a buzzer sounded

Thirty yards beyond Walther saw the front desk and the door open to
the street He acted with the impulse A sidestep took him around the
servorobot and then he was racing toward the door

Three steps later a viselike grip clamped around his shoulders and
swept him off his feet Twisting he saw that the servorobots arm had
elongated and that the fingers had stretched to encircle his body He
kicked hard at the arm and that was his last conscious act

The next time Walther opened his eyes his head throbbed so violently
he closed them again When the spinning stopped he tried once more

Around him he saw four metallic walls and overhead a ceiling of
similar material Except for a ventilator grid and the outlines of
two doors there were no breaks in the wall and no decorations He was
lying on a low narrow cot and was still fully dressed

He felt his head There was a large lump above his right temple where
he might have struck the floor But he was still too groggy for much
speculation He closed his eyes to ease the throbbing and fell into
an uneasy sleep

The creaking of the door must have roused him for it was closing as he
focussed on it A tray of food was within arms reach A smaller door
behind his bed had been opened it led to a tiny washroom

After freshening up and trying the food Walther felt much better He
was a strongnerved young man not accustomed to worry and he tried
to weigh the facts for and against him If the shipments had gone off
without a hitch things might not be so bad Hed been found leaving
the vaults but no one would suppose that hed have stayed around after
somehow disposing of the books They might suspect him but it would
be hard to disprove his story that hed taken the elevator by mistake
the day before and been trapped overnight Anyway as a visitor from
another galaxy he was entitled to certain consideration

He felt even better when the door opened late in the afternoon to admit
Willy Fritsh and a tightlipped man of about forty

Your lawyer said Willy He looked and sounded grim

After completing introductions Willy told him that he was indeed
accused of the theft and would be arraigned in the morning

They cant prove it Walther answered calmly

They think they can Our Digester friendremember our Bohemian
eveninghas come forward to accuse you Hell testify about the offer
we made him

We Will he accuse you too

Not exactly Im supposed to be an innocent bystander A friend who
was used

In spite of the circumstances a hint of the old sparkle returned to
Willys eyes and he smiled faintly

What can they do about it Walther demanded After all he was a Von
Koenigsburg

Willys smile vanished

Our legal friend here says ten years would be a light sentence

They discussed the case for an hour while the lawyer took meticulous
notes Then through Willy the attorney began questioning Walther
about his financial status Even in the language of consonants his
voice was suave

The lawyers precise little symbols wavered as Walther briefly outlined
his family circumstances but a servorobot opened the door before
further questions could be asked

Willy started to shake hands with Walther then impulsively put his
arms around him There were tears in the corners of his blue eyes He
tried to say something but gave it up and hurried out the door behind
the attorney

Wait Walther called after him Have you heard anything from Maria

Willy sadly shook his head

No Nothing

Walther had scarcely finished breakfast next morning when a servorobot
came to take him to court The robot linked thumb and forefinger around
Walthers wrist with the grip of a handcuff

There were no spectators in the courtroom perhaps Walther thought
glumly because it was a free attraction that would interfere with
the consumption of happy time entertainment Willy joined him at the
defendants table

Still the loyal misguided friend Willy murmured I volunteered to
be your interpreter

The Judge was a human but all clerks and bailiffs were servorobots
As soon as the court was gaveled into session the Prosecutor presented
a twentysecond digest of the case against Walther and called the
little Digester as a substantiating witness

Walther didnt need any translation to understand what the witness was
saying Shifting unhappily in his chair and avoiding Willys eyes the
little Digester answered preliminary questions in a scarcely audible
voice But when he pointed his finger at Walther his voice became
shrill and he reddened to the top of his bald head

Now hell be afraid to attend one of our meetings Willy murmured
Thats what hes really blaming you for

When the Digester left the stand a portly man with a perpetual
tick in his left cheek arose to address the court He was at the
Prosecutors table and until this moment had seemed to take very
little interest in the proceedings But now he spoke in a steeledged
voice that was in surprising contrast to his slow heavy movements

Hes speaking as a friend of the court Willy whispered His
office is legal representative of the Happy Time cartel in Uniport
Hes telling the court what a terrible offense you committedbut is
willingin the public interest not to press charges if youll return
the books at once Otherwise he demands you be held for trial without
bail

Walthers lawyer conferred briefly with Willy The Judge and Prosecutor
also conferred and both spoke with obvious deference to the Happy Time
attorney

With a bow to all three Walthers lawyer addressed the court His
smooth voice rippled lightly over the harsh consonants and his thin
lips parted often in a swift mirthless smile He spoke for almost a
minute and the Judge began to toy with his gavel watching the Happy
Time attorney for a cue to his feelings The attorney had slumped back
in his chair eyes drooping But the tick in his cheek worked furiously

Then Walthers lawyer turned toward the Happy Time lawyer and paused
dramatically

Hes talking about your family Willy whispered again I think hes
exaggerating a bit but he says they own an entire planet twice the
size of Earth

When the lawyer continued the smoothness was gone from his voice His
words came hard crisp brief The elderly Judge sagged back in his
chair the Prosecutor blinked and the Happy Time attorney allowed his
eyes to close completely

I hope you approve Willy said in a shaky whisper Youve just
offered to deposit a hundred million credits with the Happy Time cartel
as assurance the books will be returned

WhatI dont even admit taking them

Neither does your lawyer But as he puts it if anyone acting in your
behalf but without your direct knowledge should have seized these
books and shipped them off the Earth you will assume responsibility
for their return Otherwise they may be turned loose among the people
of Earth to plant seeds of future trouble

Walthers lawyer emphasized one brief phrase and sat down Even
Walther recognized the words One hundred million credits

The Happy Time attorney slowly opened his eyes and heaved himself to
his feet He spread out both pudgy hands to the Judge and shrugged his
bulking shoulders He spoke briefly and the steeledge was gone from
his voice

He suggests that the court in its wisdom temper justice with mercy
Willy translated excitedly

After this it was a matter of detail with the Prosecutor insisting
only that Walther be kept in custody and deported immediately after the
deposit had been arranged

The strain of the whole affair had been too much for Willy but as the
smiling servorobot led Walther out of the courtroom he called after
him

Ill be at the landing

Walther knew he should be happy He had found what he wanted on Earth
Not in the way he had hoped but the final reckoning was the same
Still there was an emptiness to it all an emptiness and an aching

When he cleared customs and was released by his servorobot guard
Walther saw Willy Fritsh waiting beside the Cyngus III shuttleship A
half dozen of his musicians were with him

Willy said with simple directness

If you want us wed like to go with you

Of all the things that had happened to him in the last twentyfour
hours this took Walther most completely by surprise He stared
speechless from Willy to the musicians most of them older men

These few came to me Willy said They dont want to go back to our
own musicNeither do I His voice broke and he continued pleading
We can help bring your dream to life in the few years left to us

Walther enveloped the old maestro in a bearhug that crushed the
breath out of him

Want you he cried Now whos a fool

You are gasped Willy if you thought Id leave part of my heart
behind

Walther looked around quickly

At the top of the shuttleship ramp stood a young woman with half a
smile and half a question on her lips There was doubt in that smile
and fear There was loneliness and wonder and hope It was a promise
and a warning of all that lay ahead for them out there beyond the
stars

Humbly more knowing that he had yet been in his short life Walther
held out his hands and walked up the ramp toward hertoward a dream
that was over and a reality that could be more bitter more sweet
than any dream

volunteer support

necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition
