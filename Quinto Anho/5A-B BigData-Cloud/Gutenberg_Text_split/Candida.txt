CANDIDA

BERNARD SHAW





ACT I

A fine October morning in the north east suburbs of London a vast
district many miles away from the London of Mayfair and St Jamess
much less known there than the Paris of the Rue de Rivoli and the
Champs Elysees and much less narrow squalid fetid and airless in its
slums strong in comfortable prosperous middle class life
widestreeted myriadpopulated wellserved with ugly iron urinals
Radical clubs tram lines and a perpetual stream of yellow cars
enjoying in its main thoroughfares the luxury of grassgrown front
gardens untrodden by the foot of man save as to the path from the
gate to the hall door but blighted by an intolerable monotony of miles
and miles of graceless characterless brick houses black iron
railings stony pavements slaty roofs and respectably ill dressed or
disreputably poorly dressed people quite accustomed to the place and
mostly plodding about somebody elses work which they would not do if
they themselves could help it The little energy and eagerness that
crop up show themselves in cockney cupidity and business push Even
the policemen and the chapels are not infrequent enough to break the
monotony The sun is shining cheerfully there is no fog and though
the smoke effectually prevents anything whether faces and hands or
bricks and mortar from looking fresh and clean it is not hanging
heavily enough to trouble a Londoner

This desert of unattractiveness has its oasis Near the outer end of
the Hackney Road is a park of  acres fenced in not by railings
but by a wooden paling and containing plenty of greensward trees a
lake for bathers flower beds with the flowers arranged carefully in
patterns by the admired cockney art of carpet gardening and a sandpit
imported from the seaside for the delight of the children but speedily
deserted on its becoming a natural vermin preserve for all the petty
fauna of Kingsland Hackney and Hoxton A bandstand an unfinished
forum for religious antireligious and political orators cricket
pitches a gymnasium and an old fashioned stone kiosk are among its
attractions Wherever the prospect is bounded by trees or rising green
grounds it is a pleasant place Where the ground stretches far to the
grey palings with bricks and mortar sky signs crowded chimneys and
smoke beyond the prospect makes it desolate and sordid

The best view of Victoria Park is from the front window of St
Dominics Parsonage from which not a single chimney is visible The
parsonage is a semidetached villa with a front garden and a porch
Visitors go up the flight of steps to the porch tradespeople and
members of the family go down by a door under the steps to the
basement with a breakfast room used for all meals in front and the
kitchen at the back Upstairs on the level of the hall door is the
drawingroom with its large plate glass window looking on the park In
this room the only sittingroom that can be spared from the children
and the family meals the parson the Reverend James Mavor Morell does
his work He is sitting in a strong round backed revolving chair at the
right hand end of a long table which stands across the window so that
he can cheer himself with the view of the park at his elbow At the
opposite end of the table adjoining it is a little table only half
the width of the other with a typewriter on it His typist is sitting
at this machine with her back to the window The large table is
littered with pamphlets journals letters nests of drawers an office
diary postage scales and the like A spare chair for visitors having
business with the parson is in the middle turned to his end Within
reach of his hand is a stationery case and a cabinet photograph in a
frame Behind him the right hand wall recessed above the fireplace is
fitted with bookshelves on which an adept eye can measure the parsons
divinity and casuistry by a complete set of Brownings poems and
Maurices Theological Essays and guess at his politics from a yellow
backed Progress and Poverty Fabian Essays a Dream of John Ball
Marxs Capital and half a dozen other literary landmarks in Socialism
Opposite him on the left near the typewriter is the door Further
down the room opposite the fireplace a bookcase stands on a cellaret
with a sofa near it There is a generous fire burning and the hearth
with a comfortable armchair and a japanned flower painted coal scuttle
at one side a miniature chair for a boy or girl on the other a nicely
varnished wooden mantelpiece with neatly moulded shelves tiny bits of
mirror let into the panels and a travelling clock in a leather case
the inevitable wedding present and on the wall above a large
autotype of the chief figure in Titians Virgin of the Assumption is
very inviting Altogether the room is the room of a good housekeeper
vanquished as far as the table is concerned by an untidy man but
elsewhere mistress of the situation The furniture in its ornamental
aspect betrays the style of the advertised drawingroom suite of the
pushing suburban furniture dealer but there is nothing useless or
pretentious in the room The paper and panelling are dark throwing the
big cheery window and the park outside into strong relief

The Reverend James Mavor Morell is a Christian Socialist clergyman of
the Church of England and an active member of the Guild of St Matthew
and the Christian Social Union A vigorous genial popular man of
forty robust and goodlooking full of energy with pleasant hearty
considerate manners and a sound unaffected voice which he uses with
the clean athletic articulation of a practised orator and with a wide
range and perfect command of expression He is a first rate clergyman
able to say what he likes to whom he likes to lecture people without
setting himself up against them to impose his authority on them
without humiliating them and to interfere in their business without
impertinence His wellspring of spiritual enthusiasm and sympathetic
emotion has never run dry for a moment he still eats and sleeps
heartily enough to win the daily battle between exhaustion and
recuperation triumphantly Withal a great baby pardonably vain of his
powers and unconsciously pleased with himself He has a healthy
complexion a good forehead with the brows somewhat blunt and the
eyes bright and eager a mouth resolute but not particularly well cut
and a substantial nose with the mobile spreading nostrils of the
dramatic orator but like all his features void of subtlety

The typist Miss Proserpine Garnett is a brisk little woman of about
 of the lower middle class neatly but cheaply dressed in a black
merino skirt and a blouse rather pert and quick of speech and not
very civil in her manner but sensitive and affectionate She is
clattering away busily at her machine whilst Morell opens the last of
his mornings letters He realizes its contents with a comic groan of
despair

PROSERPINE Another lecture

MORELL Yes The Hoxton Freedom Group want me to address them on Sunday
morning great emphasis on Sunday this being the unreasonable part
of the business What are they

PROSERPINE Communist Anarchists I think

MORELL Just like Anarchists not to know that they cant have a parson
on Sunday Tell them to come to church if they want to hear me it will
do them good Say I can only come on Mondays and Thursdays Have you
the diary there

PROSERPINE taking up the diary Yes

MORELL Have I any lecture on for next Monday

PROSERPINE referring to diary Tower Hamlets Radical Club

MORELL Well Thursday then

PROSERPINE English Land Restoration League

MORELL What next

PROSERPINE Guild of St Matthew on Monday Independent Labor Party
Greenwich Branch on Thursday Monday SocialDemocratic Federation
Mile End Branch Thursday first Confirmation class Impatiently
Oh Id better tell them you cant come Theyre only half a dozen
ignorant and conceited costermongers without five shillings between
them

MORELL amused Ah but you see theyre near relatives of mine Miss
Garnett

PROSERPINE staring at him Relatives of YOURS

MORELL Yes we have the same fatherin Heaven

PROSERPINE relieved Oh is that all

MORELL with a sadness which is a luxury to a man whose voice expresses
it so finely Ah you dont believe it Everybody says it nobody
believes itnobody Briskly getting back to business Well well
Come Miss Proserpine cant you find a date for the costers What
about the th that was vacant the day before yesterday

PROSERPINE referring to diary Engagedthe Fabian Society

MORELL Bother the Fabian Society Is the th gone too

PROSERPINE City dinner Youre invited to dine with the Founders
Company

MORELL Thatll do Ill go to the Hoxton Group of Freedom instead
She enters the engagement in silence with implacable disparagement of
the Hoxton Anarchists in every line of her face Morell bursts open the
cover of a copy of The Church Reformer which has come by post and
glances through Mr Stewart Hendlams leader and the Guild of St
Matthew news These proceedings are presently enlivened by the
appearance of Morells curate the Reverend Alexander Mill a young
gentleman gathered by Morell from the nearest University settlement
whither he had come from Oxford to give the east end of London the
benefit of his university training He is a conceitedly well
intentioned enthusiastic immature person with nothing positively
unbearable about him except a habit of speaking with his lips carefully
closed for half an inch from each corner a finicking arthulation and
a set of horribly corrupt vowels notably ow for o this being his
chief means of bringing Oxford refinement to bear on Hackney vulgarity
Morell whom he has won over by a doglike devotion looks up
indulgently from The Church Reformer as he enters and remarks Well
Lexy Late again as usual

LEXY Im afraid so I wish I could get up in the morning

MORELL exulting in his own energy Ha ha Whimsically Watch and
pray Lexy watch and pray

LEXY I know Rising wittily to the occasion But how can I watch and
pray when I am asleep Isnt that so Miss Prossy

PROSERPINE sharply Miss Garnett if you please

LEXY I beg your pardonMiss Garnett

PROSERPINE Youve got to do all the work today

LEXY Why

PROSERPINE Never mind why It will do you good to earn your supper
before you eat it for once in a way as I do Come dont dawdle You
should have been off on your rounds half an hour ago

LEXY perplexed Is she in earnest Morell

MORELL in the highest spiritshis eyes dancing Yes I am going to
dawdle today

LEXY You You dont know how

MORELL heartily Ha ha Dont I Im going to have this day all to
myselfor at least the forenoon My wifes coming back shes due here
at 

LEXY surprised Coming back alreadywith the children I thought
they were to stay to the end of the month

MORELL So they are shes only coming up for two days to get some
flannel things for Jimmy and to see how were getting on without her

LEXY anxiously But my dear Morell if what Jimmy and Fluffy had was
scarlatina do you think it wise

MORELL Scarlatinarubbish German measles I brought it into the
house myself from the Pycroft Street School A parson is like a doctor
my boy he must face infection as a soldier must face bullets He
rises and claps Lexy on the shoulder Catch the measles if you can
Lexy shell nurse you and what a piece of luck that will be for
youeh

LEXY smiling uneasily Its so hard to understand you about Mrs
Morell

MORELL tenderly Ah my boy get marriedget married to a good
woman and then youll understand Thats a foretaste of what will be
best in the Kingdom of Heaven we are trying to establish on earth That
will cure you of dawdling An honest man feels that he must pay Heaven
for every hour of happiness with a good spell of hard unselfish work
to make others happy We have no more right to consume happiness
without producing it than to consume wealth without producing it Get a
wife like my Candida and youll always be in arrear with your
repayment He pats Lexy affectionately on the back and is leaving the
room when Lexy calls to him

LEXY Oh wait a bit I forgot Morell halts and turns with the door
knob in his hand Your fatherinlaw is coming round to see you
Morell shuts the door again with a complete change of manner

MORELL surprised and not pleased Mr Burgess

LEXY Yes I passed him in the park arguing with somebody He gave me
good day and asked me to let you know that he was coming

MORELL half incredulous But he hasnt called here forI may almost
say for years Are you sure Lexy Youre not joking are you

LEXY earnestly No sir really

MORELL thoughtfully Hm Time for him to take another look at Candida
before she grows out of his knowledge He resigns himself to the
inevitable and goes out Lexy looks after him with beaming foolish
worship

LEXY What a good man What a thorough loving soul he is He takes
Morells place at the table making himself very comfortable as he
takes out a cigaret

PROSERPINE impatiently pulling the letter she has been working at off
the typewriter and folding it Oh a man ought to be able to be fond
of his wife without making a fool of himself about her

LEXY shocked Oh Miss Prossy

PROSERPINE rising busily and coming to the stationery case to get an
envelope in which she encloses the letter as she speaks Candida
here and Candida there and Candida everywhere She licks the
envelope Its enough to drive anyone out of their SENSES thumping
the envelope to make it stick to hear a perfectly commonplace woman
raved about in that absurd manner merely because shes got good hair
and a tolerable figure

LEXY with reproachful gravity I think her extremely beautiful Miss
Garnett He takes the photograph up looks at it and adds with even
greater impressiveness EXTREMELY beautiful How fine her eyes are

PROSERPINE Her eyes are not a bit better than minenow He puts down
the photograph and stares austerely at her And you know very well
that you think me dowdy and second rate enough

LEXY rising majestically Heaven forbid that I should think of any of
Gods creatures in such a way He moves stiffly away from her across
the room to the neighbourhood of the bookcase

PROSERPINE Thank you Thats very nice and comforting

LEXY saddened by her depravity I had no idea you had any feeling
against Mrs Morell

PROSERPINE indignantly I have no feeling against her Shes very
nice very goodhearted Im very fond of her and can appreciate her
real qualities far better than any man can He shakes his head sadly
and turns to the bookcase looking along the shelves for a volume She
follows him with intense pepperiness You dont believe me He turns
and faces her She pounces at him with spitfire energy You think Im
jealous Oh what a profound knowledge of the human heart you have Mr
Lexy Mill How well you know the weaknesses of Woman dont you It
must be so nice to be a man and have a fine penetrating intellect
instead of mere emotions like us and to know that the reason we dont
share your amorous delusions is that were all jealous of one another
She abandons him with a toss of her shoulders and crosses to the fire
to warm her hands

LEXY Ah if you women only had the same clue to Mans strength that
you have to his weakness Miss Prossy there would be no Woman Question

PROSERPINE over her shoulder as she stoops holding her hands to the
blaze Where did you hear Morell say that You didnt invent it
yourself youre not clever enough

LEXY Thats quite true I am not ashamed of owing him that as I owe
him so many other spiritual truths He said it at the annual conference
of the Womens Liberal Federation Allow me to add that though they
didnt appreciate it I a mere man did He turns to the bookcase
again hoping that this may leave her crushed

PROSERPINE putting her hair straight at the little panel of mirror in
the mantelpiece Well when you talk to me give me your own ideas
such as they are and not his You never cut a poorer figure than when
you are trying to imitate him

LEXY stung I try to follow his example not to imitate him

PROSERPINE coming at him again on her way back to her work Yes you
do you IMITATE him Why do you tuck your umbrella under your left arm
instead of carrying it in your hand like anyone else Why do you walk
with your chin stuck out before you hurrying along with that eager
look in your eyesyou who never get up before half past nine in the
morning Why do you say knoaledge in church though you always say
knolledge in private conversation Bah do you think I dont know
She goes back to the typewriter Here come and set about your work
weve wasted enough time for one morning Heres a copy of the diary
for today She hands him a memorandum

LEXY deeply offended Thank you He takes it and stands at the table
with his back to her reading it She begins to transcribe her
shorthand notes on the typewriter without troubling herself about his
feelings Mr Burgess enters unannounced He is a man of sixty made
coarse and sordid by the compulsory selfishness of petty commerce and
later on softened into sluggish bumptiousness by overfeeding and
commercial success A vulgar ignorant guzzling man offensive and
contemptuous to people whose labor is cheap respectful to wealth and
rank and quite sincere and without rancour or envy in both attitudes
Finding him without talent the world has offered him no decently paid
work except ignoble work and he has become in consequence somewhat
hoggish But he has no suspicion of this himself and honestly regards
his commercial prosperity as the inevitable and socially wholesome
triumph of the ability industry shrewdness and experience in business
of a man who in private is easygoing affectionate and humorously
convivial to a fault Corporeally he is a podgy man with a square
clean shaven face and a square beard under his chin dust colored with
a patch of grey in the centre and small watery blue eyes with a
plaintively sentimental expression which he transfers easily to his
voice by his habit of pompously intoning his sentences

BURGESS stopping on the threshold and looking round They told me
Mr Morell was here

PROSERPINE rising Hes upstairs Ill fetch him for you

BURGESS staring boorishly at her Youre not the same young lady as
used to typewrite for him

PROSERPINE No

BURGESS assenting No she was younger Miss Garnett stolidly stares
at him then goes out with great dignity He receives this quite
obtusely and crosses to the hearthrug where he turns and spreads
himself with his back to the fire Startin on your rounds Mr Mill

LEXY folding his paper and pocketing it Yes I must be off presently

BURGESS momentously Dont let me detain you Mr Mill What I come
about is private between me and Mr Morell

LEXY huffily I have no intention of intruding I am sure Mr
Burgess Good morning

BURGESS patronizingly Oh good morning to you Morell returns as
Lexy is making for the door

MORELL to Lexy Off to work

LEXY Yes sir

MORELL patting him affectionately on the shoulder Take my silk
handkerchief and wrap your throat up Theres a cold wind Away with
you

Lexy brightens up and goes out

BURGESS Spoilin your curates as usul James Good mornin When I
pay a man an is livin depens on me I keep him in his place

MORELL rather shortly I always keep my curates in their places as my
helpers and comrades If you get as much work out of your clerks and
warehousemen as I do out of my curates you must be getting rich pretty
fast Will you take your old chair

He points with curt authority to the arm chair beside the fireplace
then takes the spare chair from the table and sits down in front of
Burgess

BURGESS without moving Just the same as hever James

MORELL When you last calledit was about three years ago I
thinkyou said the same thing a little more frankly Your exact words
then were Just as big a fool as ever James

BURGESS soothingly Well perhaps I did but with conciliatory
cheerfulness I meant no offence by it A clergyman is privileged to be
a bit of a fool you know its ony becomin in his profession that he
should Anyhow I come here not to rake up hold differences but to
let bygones be bygones Suddenly becoming very solemn and approaching
Morell James three year ago you done me a hill turn You done me
hout of a contrac an when I gev you arsh words in my natral
disappointment you turned my daughrter again me Well Ive come to
act the part of a Cherischin Offering his hand I forgive you James

MORELL starting up Confound your impudence

BURGESS retreating with almost lachrymose deprecation of this
treatment Is that becomin language for a clergyman Jamesand you
so particlar too

MORELL hotly No sir it is not becoming language for a clergyman I
used the wrong word I should have said damn your impudence thats
what St Paul or any honest priest would have said to you Do you
think I have forgotten that tender of yours for the contract to supply
clothing to the workhouse

BURGESS in a paroxysm of public spirit I acted in the interest of
the ratepayers James It was the lowest tender you cant deny that

MORELL Yes the lowest because you paid worse wages than any other
employerstarvation wagesaye worse than starvation wagesto the
women who made the clothing Your wages would have driven them to the
streets to keep body and soul together Getting angrier and angrier
Those women were my parishioners I shamed the Guardians out of
accepting your tender I shamed the ratepayers out of letting them do
it I shamed everybody but you Boiling over How dare you sir come
here and offer to forgive me and talk about your daughter and

BURGESS Easy James easy easy Dont git hinto a fluster about
nothink Ive howned I was wrong

MORELL fuming about Have you I didnt hear you

BURGESS Of course I did I hown it now Come I harsk your pardon for
the letter I wrote you Is that enough

MORELL snapping his fingers Thats nothing Have you raised the
wages

BURGESS triumphantly Yes

MORELL stopping dead What

BURGESS unctuously Ive turned a moddle hemployer I dont hemploy
no women now theyre all sacked and the work is done by machinery
Not a man as less than sixpence a hour and the skilled ands gits the
Trade Union rate Proudly What ave you to say to me now

MORELL overwhelmed Is it possible Well theres more joy in heaven
over one sinner that repenteth Going to Burgess with an explosion of
apologetic cordiality My dear Burgess I most heartily beg your
pardon for my hard thoughts of you Grasps his hand And now dont
you feel the better for the change Come confess youre happier You
look happier

BURGESS ruefully Well praps I do I spose I must since you
notice it At all events I git my contrax asseppit accepted by the
County Council Savagely They dussentave nothink to do with me
unless I paid fair wagescurse em for a parcel o meddlin fools

MORELL dropping his hand utterly discouraged So that was why you
raised the wages He sits down moodily

BURGESS severely in spreading mounting tones Why else should I do
it What does it lead to but drink and huppishness in workin men He
seats himself magisterially in the easy chair Its hall very well for
you James it gits you hinto the papers and makes a great man of you
but you never think of the arm you do puttin money into the pockets
of workin men that they dont know ow to spend and takin it from
people that might be makin a good huse on it

MORELL with a heavy sigh speaking with cold politeness What is your
business with me this morning I shall not pretend to believe that you
are here merely out of family sentiment

BURGESS obstinately Yes I hamjust family sentiment and nothink
else

MORELL with weary calm I dont believe you

BURGESS rising threateningly Dont say that to me again James Mavor
Morell

MORELL unmoved Ill say it just as often as may be necessary to
convince you that its true I dont believe you

BURGESS collapsing into an abyss of wounded feeling Oh well if
youre determined to be unfriendly I spose Id better go He moves
reluctantly towards the door Morell makes no sign He lingers I
didnt hexpect to find a hunforgivin spirit in you James Morell
still not responding he takes a few more reluctant steps doorwards
Then he comes back whining We huseter git on well enough spite of
our different opinions Why are you so changed to me I give you my
word I come here in pyorr pure frenliness not wishin to be on bad
terms with my hown daughrters usban Come James be a Cherishin and
shake ands He puts his hand sentimentally on Morells shoulder

MORELL looking up at him thoughtfully Look here Burgess Do you
want to be as welcome here as you were before you lost that contract

BURGESS I do James I dohonest

MORELL Then why dont you behave as you did then

BURGESS cautiously removing his hand Ow dymean

MORELL Ill tell you You thought me a young fool then

BURGESS coaxingly No I didnt James I

MORELL cutting him short Yes you did And I thought you an old
scoundrel

BURGESS most vehemently deprecating this gross selfaccusation on
Morells part No you didnt James Now you do yourself a hinjustice

MORELL Yes I did Well that did not prevent our getting on very well
together God made you what I call a scoundrel as he made me what you
call a fool The effect of this observation on Burgess is to remove
the keystone of his moral arch He becomes bodily weak and with his
eyes fixed on Morell in a helpless stare puts out his hand
apprehensively to balance himself as if the floor had suddenly sloped
under him Morell proceeds in the same tone of quiet conviction It
was not for me to quarrel with his handiwork in the one case more than
in the other So long as you come here honestly as a selfrespecting
thorough convinced scoundrel justifying your scoundrelism and proud
of it you are welcome But and now Morells tone becomes formidable
and he rises and strikes the back of the chair for greater emphasis I
wont have you here snivelling about being a model employer and a
converted man when youre only an apostate with your coat turned for
the sake of a County Council contract He nods at him to enforce the
point then goes to the hearthrug where he takes up a comfortably
commanding position with his back to the fire and continues No I
like a man to be true to himself even in wickedness Come now either
take your hat and go or else sit down and give me a good scoundrelly
reason for wanting to be friends with me Burgess whose emotions have
subsided sufficiently to be expressed by a dazed grin is relieved by
this concrete proposition He ponders it for a moment and then slowly
and very modestly sits down in the chair Morell has just left Thats
right Now out with it

BURGESS chuckling in spite of himself Well you ARE a queer bird
James and no mistake But almost enthusiastically one carnt elp
likin you besides as I said afore of course one dont take all a
clorgyman says seriously or the world couldnt go on Could it now
He composes himself for graver discourse and turning his eyes on
Morell proceeds with dull seriousness Well I dont mind tellin you
since its your wish we should be free with one another that I did
think you a bit of a fool once but Im beginnin to think that praps
I was beind the times a bit

MORELL delighted  Aha Youre finding that out at last are you

BURGESS portentously Yes times as changed morn I could a
believed Five yorr year ago no sensible man would a thought o
takin up with your ideas I hused to wonder you was let preach at all
Why I know a clorgyman that as bin kep hout of his job for yorrs by
the Bishop of London although the pore fellers not a bit more
religious than you are But today if henyone was to offer to bet me a
thousan poun that youll end by bein a bishop yourself I shouldnt
venture to take the bet You and yore crew are gettin hinfluential I
can see that Theyll ave to give you something someday if its only
to stop yore mouth You ad the right instinc arter all James the
line you took is the payin line in the long run fur a man o your sort

MORELL decisivelyoffering his hand Shake hands Burgess Now
youre talking honestly I dont think theyll make me a bishop but if
they do Ill introduce you to the biggest jobbers I can get to come to
my dinner parties

BURGESS who has risen with a sheepish grin and accepted the hand of
friendship You will ave your joke James Our quarrels made up now
isnt it

A WOMANS VOICE Say yes James

Startled they turn quickly and find that Candida has just come in and
is looking at them with an amused maternal indulgence which is her
characteristic expression She is a woman of  well built well
nourished likely one guesses to become matronly later on but now
quite at her best with the double charm of youth and motherhood Her
ways are those of a woman who has found that she can always manage
people by engaging their affection and who does so frankly and
instinctively without the smallest scruple So far she is like any
other pretty woman who is just clever enough to make the most of her
sexual attractions for trivially selfish ends but Candidas serene
brow courageous eyes and well set mouth and chin signify largeness of
mind and dignity of character to ennoble her cunning in the affections
A wisehearted observer looking at her would at once guess that
whoever had placed the Virgin of the Assumption over her hearth did so
because he fancied some spiritual resemblance between them and yet
would not suspect either her husband or herself of any such idea or
indeed of any concern with the art of Titian

Just now she is in bonnet and mantle laden with a strapped rug with
her umbrella stuck through it a handbag and a supply of illustrated
papers

MORELL shocked at his remissness Candida Whylooks at his watch
and is horrified to find it so late My darling Hurrying to her and
seizing the rug strap pouring forth his remorseful regrets all the
time I intended to meet you at the train I let the time slip
Flinging the rug on the sofa I was so engrossed byreturning to
herI forgotoh He embraces her with penitent emotion

BURGESS a little shamefaced and doubtful of his reception How ors
you Candy She still in Morells arms offers him her cheek which
he kisses James and me is come to a unnerstandina honourable
unnerstandin Ain we James

MORELL impetuously Oh bother your understanding Youve kept me
late for Candida With compassionate fervor My poor love how did
you manage about the luggagehow

CANDIDA stopping him and disengaging herself  There there there I
wasnt alone Eugene came down yesterday and we traveled up together

MORELL pleased Eugene

CANDIDA Yes hes struggling with my luggage poor boy Go out dear
at once or he will pay for the cab and I dont want that Morell
hurries out Candida puts down her handbag then takes off her mantle
and bonnet and puts them on the sofa with the rug chatting meanwhile
Well papa how are you getting on at home

BURGESS The ouse aint worth livin in since you left it Candy I
wish youd come round and give the gurl a talkin to Whos this Eugene
thats come with you

CANDIDA Oh Eugenes one of Jamess discoveries He found him sleeping
on the Embankment last June Havent you noticed our new picture
pointing to the Virgin He gave us that

BURGESS incredulously Garn Dyou mean to tell meyour hown
fatherthat cab touts or such like orf the Embankment buys picturs
like that Severely Dont deceive me Candy its a Igh Church
pictur and James chose it hisself

CANDIDA Guess again Eugene isnt a cab tout

BURGESS Then wot is he Sarcastically A nobleman I spose

CANDIDA delightednodding Yes His uncles a peera real live earl

BURGESS not daring to believe such good news No

CANDIDA Yes He had a seven day bill for  pounds in his pocket when
James found him on the Embankment He thought he couldnt get any money
for it until the seven days were up and he was too shy to ask for
credit Oh hes a dear boy We are very fond of him

BURGESS pretending to belittle the aristocracy but with his eyes
gleaming Hm I thort you wouldnt git a piorrs peers nevvy
visitin in Victoria Park unless he were a bit of a flat Looking
again at the picture Of course I dont old with that pictur Candy
but still its a igh class fust rate work of art I can see that Be
sure you hintroduce me to him Candy He looks at his watch
anxiously I can only stay about two minutes

Morell comes back with Eugene whom Burgess contemplates moisteyed
with enthusiasm He is a strange shy youth of eighteen slight
effeminate with a delicate childish voice and a hunted tormented
expression and shrinking manner that show the painful sensitiveness
that very swift and acute apprehensiveness produces in youth before
the character has grown to its full strength Yet everything that his
timidity and frailty suggests is contradicted by his face He is
miserably irresolute does not know where to stand or what to do with
his hands and feet is afraid of Burgess and would run away into
solitude if he dared but the very intensity with which he feels a
perfectly commonplace position shows great nervous force and his
nostrils and mouth show a fiercely petulant wilfulness as to the
quality of which his great imaginative eyes and fine brow are
reassuring He is so entirely uncommon as to be almost unearthly and
to prosaic people there is something noxious in this unearthliness
just as to poetic people there is something angelic in it His dress is
anarchic He wears an old blue serge jacket unbuttoned over a woollen
lawn tennis shirt with a silk handkerchief for a cravat trousers
matching the jacket and brown canvas shoes In these garments he has
apparently lain in the heather and waded through the waters but there
is no evidence of his having ever brushed them

As he catches sight of a stranger on entering he stops and edges
along the wall on the opposite side of the room

MORELL as he enters Come along you can spare us quarter of an hour
at all events This is my fatherinlaw Mr BurgessMr Marchbanks

MARCHBANKS nervously backing against the bookcase Glad to meet you

BURGESS crossing to him with great heartiness whilst Morell joins
Candida at the fire Glad to meet YOU Im shore Mr Morchbanks

with laughter

CANDIDA coming to the rescue Youll lose your train papa if you

BURGESS roaring with glee Down in Surreyhar har thats not a bad
one Well I never met a man as didnt know Nortn Folgit
beforeAbashed at his own noisiness Goodbye Mr Morchbanks I know

MARCHBANKS taking it with a nervous jerk Not at all

BURGESS Bye bye Candy Ill look in again later on So long James

MORELL Must you go

BURGESS Dont stir He goes out with unabated heartiness

MORELL Oh Ill see you out He follows him out Eugene stares after
them apprehensively holding his breath until Burgess disappears

CANDIDA laughing Well Eugene He turns with a start and comes
eagerly towards her but stops irresolutely as he meets her amused
look What do you think of my father

MARCHBANKS II hardly know him yet He seems to be a very nice old
gentleman

CANDIDA with gentle irony And youll go to the Freeman Founders to
dine with him wont you

MARCHBANKS miserably taking it quite seriously Yes if it will
please you

CANDIDA touched Do you know you are a very nice boy Eugene with
all your queerness If you had laughed at my father I shouldnt have
minded but I like you ever so much better for being nice to him

MARCHBANKS Ought I to have laughed I noticed that he said something
funny but I am so ill at ease with strangers and I never can see a
joke Im very sorry He sits down on the sofa his elbows on his
knees and his temples between his fists with an expression of hopeless
suffering

CANDIDA bustling him goodnaturedly Oh come You great baby you
You are worse than usual this morning Why were you so melancholy as we
came along in the cab

MARCHBANKS Oh that was nothing I was wondering how much I ought to
give the cabman I know its utterly silly but you dont know how
dreadful such things are to mehow I shrink from having to deal with
strange people Quickly and reassuringly But its all right He
beamed all over and touched his hat when Morell gave him two shillings
I was on the point of offering him ten Candida laughs heartily
Morell comes back with a few letters and newspapers which have come by
the midday post

CANDIDA Oh James dear he was going to give the cabman ten
shillingsten shillings for a three minutes driveoh dear

MORELL at the table glancing through the letters Never mind her
Marchbanks The overpaying instinct is a generous one better than the
underpaying instinct and not so common

MARCHBANKS relapsing into dejection No cowardice incompetence
Mrs Morells quite right

CANDIDA Of course she is She takes up her handbag And now I must
leave you to James for the present I suppose you are too much of a
poet to know the state a woman finds her house in when shes been away
for three weeks Give me my rug Eugene takes the strapped rug from
the couch and gives it to her She takes it in her left hand having
the bag in her right Now hang my cloak across my arm He obeys Now
my hat He puts it into the hand which has the bag Now open the door
for me He hurries up before her and opens the door Thanks She
goes out and Marchbanks shuts the door

MORELL still busy at the table Youll stay to lunch Marchbanks of
course

MARCHBANKS scared I mustnt He glances quickly at Morell but at
once avoids his frank look and adds with obvious disingenuousness I
cant

MORELL over his shoulder You mean you wont

MARCHBANKS earnestly No I should like to indeed Thank you very
much Butbut

MORELL breezily finishing with the letters and coming close to him
Butbutbutbutbosh If youd like to stay stay You dont mean
to persuade me you have anything else to do If youre shy go and take
a turn in the park and write poetry until half past one and then come
in and have a good feed

MARCHBANKS Thank you I should like that very much But I really
mustnt The truth is Mrs Morell told me not to She said she didnt
think youd ask me to stay to lunch but that I was to remember if you
did that you didnt really want me to Plaintively She said Id
understand but I dont Please dont tell her I told you

MORELL drolly Oh is that all Wont my suggestion that you should
take a turn in the park meet the difficulty

MARCHBANKS How

MORELL exploding goodhumoredly Why you dufferBut this
boisterousness jars himself as well as Eugene He checks himself and
resumes with affectionate seriousness No I wont put it in that way
My dear lad in a happy marriage like ours there is something very
sacred in the return of the wife to her home Marchbanks looks quickly
at him half anticipating his meaning An old friend or a truly noble
and sympathetic soul is not in the way on such occasions but a chance
visitor is The hunted horrorstricken expression comes out with
sudden vividness in Eugenes face as he understands Morell occupied
with his own thought goes on without noticing it Candida thought I
would rather not have you here but she was wrong Im very fond of
you my boy and I should like you to see for yourself what a happy
thing it is to be married as I am

MARCHBANKS HappyYOUR marriage You think that You believe that

MORELL buoyantly I know it my lad La Rochefoucauld said that there
are convenient marriages but no delightful ones You dont know the
comfort of seeing through and through a thundering liar and rotten
cynic like that fellow Ha ha Now off with you to the park and write
your poem Half past one sharp mind we never wait for anybody

MARCHBANKS wildly No stop you shant Ill force it into the light

MORELL puzzled Eh Force what

MARCHBANKS I must speak to you There is something that must be
settled between us

MORELL with a whimsical glance at the clock Now

MARCHBANKS passionately Now Before you leave this room He
retreats a few steps and stands as if to bar Morells way to the door

MORELL without moving and gravely perceiving now that there is
something serious the matter Im not going to leave it my dear boy
I thought YOU were Eugene baffled by his firm tone turns his back
on him writhing with anger Morell goes to him and puts his hand on
his shoulder strongly and kindly disregarding his attempt to shake it
off Come sit down quietly and tell me what it is And remember we
are friends and need not fear that either of us will be anything but
patient and kind to the other whatever we may have to say

MARCHBANKS twisting himself round on him Oh I am not forgetting
myself I am only covering his face desperately with his hands full
of horror Then dropping his hands and thrusting his face forward
fiercely at Morell he goes on threateningly You shall see whether
this is a time for patience and kindness Morell firm as a rock
looks indulgently at him Dont look at me in that selfcomplacent
way You think yourself stronger than I am but I shall stagger you if
you have a heart in your breast

MORELL powerfully confident Stagger me my boy Out with it

MARCHBANKS First

MORELL First

MARCHBANKS I love your wife

Morell recoils and after staring at him for a moment in utter
amazement bursts into uncontrollable laughter Eugene is taken aback
but not disconcerted and he soon becomes indignant and contemptuous

MORELL sitting down to have his laugh out Why my dear child of
course you do Everybody loves her they cant help it I like it But
looking up whimsically at him I say Eugene do you think yours is a
case to be talked about Youre under twenty shes over thirty
Doesnt it look rather too like a case of calf love

MARCHBANKS vehemently YOU dare say that of her You think that way
of the love she inspires It is an insult to her

MORELL rising quickly in an altered tone To her Eugene take
care I have been patient I hope to remain patient But there are some
things I wont allow Dont force me to show you the indulgence I
should show to a child Be a man

MARCHBANKS with a gesture as if sweeping something behind him Oh
let us put aside all that cant It horrifies me when I think of the
doses of it she has had to endure in all the weary years during which
you have selfishly and blindly sacrificed her to minister to your
selfsufficiencyYOU turning on him who have not one thoughtone
sensein common with her

MORELL philosophically She seems to bear it pretty well Looking
him straight in the face Eugene my boy you are making a fool of
yourselfa very great fool of yourself Theres a piece of wholesome
plain speaking for you

MARCHBANKS Oh do you think I dont know all that Do you think that
the things people make fools of themselves about are any less real and
true than the things they behave sensibly about Morells gaze wavers
for the first time He instinctively averts his face and stands
listening startled and thoughtful They are more true they are the
only things that are true You are very calm and sensible and moderate
with me because you can see that I am a fool about your wife just as
no doubt that old man who was here just now is very wise over your
socialism because he sees that YOU are a fool about it Morells
perplexity deepens markedly Eugene follows up his advantage plying
him fiercely with questions Does that prove you wrong Does your
complacent superiority to me prove that I am wrong

MORELL turning on Eugene who stands his ground Marchbanks some
devil is putting these words into your mouth It is easyterribly
easyto shake a mans faith in himself To take advantage of that to
break a mans spirit is devils work Take care of what you are doing
Take care

MARCHBANKS ruthlessly I know Im doing it on purpose I told you I
should stagger you

They confront one another threateningly for a moment Then Morell
recovers his dignity

MORELL with noble tenderness Eugene listen to me Some day I hope
and trust you will be a happy man like me Eugene chafes
intolerantly repudiating the worth of his happiness Morell deeply
insulted controls himself with fine forbearance and continues
steadily with great artistic beauty of delivery You will be married
and you will be working with all your might and valor to make every
spot on earth as happy as your own home You will be one of the makers
of the Kingdom of Heaven on earth andwho knowsyou may be a
pioneer and master builder where I am only a humble journeyman for
dont think my boy that I cannot see in you young as you are
promise of higher powers than I can ever pretend to I well know that
it is in the poet that the holy spirit of manthe god within himis
most godlike It should make you tremble to think of thatto think
that the heavy burthen and great gift of a poet may be laid upon you

MARCHBANKS unimpressed and remorseless his boyish crudity of
assertion telling sharply against Morells oratory It does not make
me tremble It is the want of it in others that makes me tremble

MORELL redoubling his force of style under the stimulus of his genuine
feeling and Eugenes obduracy Then help to kindle it in themin
MEnot to extinguish it In the futurewhen you are as happy as I
amI will be your true brother in the faith I will help you to
believe that God has given us a world that nothing but our own folly
keeps from being a paradise I will help you to believe that every
stroke of your work is sowing happiness for the great harvest that
alleven the humblestshall one day reap And last but trust me not
least I will help you to believe that your wife loves you and is happy
in her home We need such help Marchbanks we need it greatly and
always There are so many things to make us doubt if once we let our
understanding be troubled Even at home we sit as if in camp
encompassed by a hostile army of doubts Will you play the traitor and
let them in on me

MARCHBANKS looking round him Is it like this for her here always A
woman with a great soul craving for reality truth freedom and
being fed on metaphors sermons stale perorations mere rhetoric Do
you think a womans soul can live on your talent for preaching

MORELL Stung Marchbanks you make it hard for me to control myself
My talent is like yours insofar as it has any real worth at all It is
the gift of finding words for divine truth

MARCHBANKS impetuously Its the gift of the gab nothing more and
nothing less What has your knack of fine talking to do with the truth
any more than playing the organ has Ive never been in your church
but Ive been to your political meetings and Ive seen you do whats
called rousing the meeting to enthusiasm that is you excited them
until they behaved exactly as if they were drunk And their wives
looked on and saw clearly enough what fools they were Oh its an old
story youll find it in the Bible I imagine King David in his fits
of enthusiasm was very like you Stabbing him with the words But
his wife despised him in her heart

MORELL wrathfully Leave my house Do you hear He advances on him
threateningly

MARCHBANKS shrinking back against the couch Let me alone Dont
touch me Morell grasps him powerfully by the lapel of his coat he
cowers down on the sofa and screams passionately Stop Morell if you
strike me Ill kill myself I wont bear it Almost in hysterics
Let me go Take your hand away

MORELL with slow emphatic scorn You little snivelling cowardly
whelp Releasing him Go before you frighten yourself into a fit

MARCHBANKS on the sofa gasping but relieved by the withdrawal of
Morells hand Im not afraid of you its you who are afraid of me

MORELL quietly as he stands over him It looks like it doesnt it

MARCHBANKS with petulant vehemence Yes it does Morell turns away
contemptuously Eugene scrambles to his feet and follows him You
think because I shrink from being brutally handledbecause with tears
in his voice I can do nothing but cry with rage when I am met with
violencebecause I cant lift a heavy trunk down from the top of a cab
like youbecause I cant fight you for your wife as a navvy would all
that makes you think that Im afraid of you But youre wrong If I
havent got what you call British pluck I havent British cowardice
either Im not afraid of a clergymans ideas Ill fight your ideas
Ill rescue her from her slavery to them Ill pit my own ideas against
them You are driving me out of the house because you darent let her
choose between your ideas and mine You are afraid to let me see her
again Morell angered turns suddenly on him He flies to the door in
involuntary dread Let me alone I say Im going

MORELL with cold scorn Wait a moment I am not going to touch you
dont be afraid When my wife comes back she will want to know why you
have gone And when she finds that you are never going to cross our
threshold again she will want to have that explained too Now I dont
wish to distress her by telling her that you have behaved like a
blackguard

MARCHBANKS Coming back with renewed vehemence You shallyou must
If you give any explanation but the true one you are a liar and a
coward  Tell her what I said and how you were strong and manly and
shook me as a terrier shakes a rat and how I shrank and was terrified
and how you called me a snivelling little whelp and put me out of the
house If you dont tell her I will Ill write to her

MORELL taken aback Why do you want her to know this

MARCHBANKS with lyric rapture Because she will understand me and
know that I understand her If you keep back one word of it from
herif you are not ready to lay the truth at her feet as I amthen
you will know to the end of your days that she really belongs to me and
not to you Goodbye Going

MORELL terribly disquieted Stop I will not tell her

MARCHBANKS turning near the door Either the truth or a lie you MUST
tell her if I go

MORELL temporizing Marchbanks it is sometimes justifiable

MARCHBANKS cutting him short I knowto lie It will be useless
Goodbye Mr Clergyman

As he turns finally to the door it opens and Candida enters in
housekeeping attire

CANDIDA Are you going EugeneLooking more observantly at him Well
dear me just look at you going out into the street in that state You
ARE a poet certainly Look at him James She takes him by the coat
and brings him forward to show him to Morell Look at his collar look
at his tie look at his hair One would think somebody had been
throttling you The two men guard themselves against betraying their
consciousness Here Stand still She buttons his collar ties his
neckerchief in a bow and arranges his hair There Now you look so
nice that I think youd better stay to lunch after all though I told
you you mustnt It will be ready in half an hour She puts a final
touch to the bow He kisses her hand Dont be silly

MARCHBANKS I want to stay of courseunless the reverend gentleman
your husband has anything to advance to the contrary

CANDIDA Shall he stay James if he promises to be a good boy and to
help me to lay the table Marchbanks turns his head and looks
steadfastly at Morell over his shoulder challenging his answer

MORELL shortly Oh yes certainly he had better He goes to the
table and pretends to busy himself with his papers there

MARCHBANKS offering his arm to Candida Come and lay the tableShe
takes it and they go to the door together As they go out he adds I am
the happiest of men

MORELL So was Ian hour ago



ACT II

The same day The same room Late in the afternoon The spare chair for
visitors has been replaced at the table which is if possible more
untidy than before Marchbanks alone and idle is trying to find out
how the typewriter works Hearing someone at the door he steals
guiltily away to the window and pretends to be absorbed in the view
Miss Garnett carrying the notebook in which she takes down Morells
letters in shorthand from his dictation sits down at the typewriter
and sets to work transcribing them much too busy to notice Eugene
Unfortunately the first key she strikes sticks

PROSERPINE Bother Youve been meddling with my typewriter Mr
Marchbanks and theres not the least use in your trying to look as if
you hadnt

MARCHBANKS timidly Im very sorry Miss Garnett I only tried to
make it write

PROSERPINE Well youve made this key stick

MARCHBANKS earnestly I assure you I didnt touch the keys I didnt
indeed I only turned a little wheel He points irresolutely at the
tension wheel

PROSERPINE Oh now I understand She sets the machine to rights
talking volubly all the time I suppose you thought it was a sort of
barrelorgan Nothing to do but turn the handle and it would write a
beautiful love letter for you straight off eh

MARCHBANKS seriously I suppose a machine could be made to write
loveletters Theyre all the same arent they

PROSERPINE somewhat indignantly any such discussion except by way of
pleasantry being outside her code of manners How do I know Why do
you ask me

MARCHBANKS I beg your pardon I thought clever peoplepeople who can
do business and write letters and that sort of thingalways had love
affairs

PROSERPINE rising outraged Mr Marchbanks She looks severely at
him and marches with much dignity to the bookcase

MARCHBANKS approaching her humbly I hope I havent offended you
Perhaps I shouldnt have alluded to your love affairs

PROSERPINE plucking a blue book from the shelf and turning sharply on
him I havent any love affairs How dare you say such a thing

MARCHBANKS simply Really Oh then you are shy like me Isnt that
so

PROSERPINE Certainly I am not shy What do you mean

MARCHBANKS secretly You must be that is the reason there are so few
love affairs in the world We all go about longing for love it is the
first need of our natures the loudest cry Of our hearts but we dare
not utter our longing we are too shy Very earnestly Oh Miss
Garnett what would you not give to be without fear without shame

PROSERPINE scandalized Well upon my word

MARCHBANKS with petulant impatience Ah dont say those stupid
things to me they dont deceive me what use are they Why are you
afraid to be your real self with me I am just like you

PROSERPINE Like me Pray are you flattering me or flattering
yourself I dont feel quite sure which She turns to go back to the
typewriter

MARCHBANKS stopping her mysteriously Hush I go about in search of
love and I find it in unmeasured stores in the bosoms of others But
when I try to ask for it this horrible shyness strangles me and I
stand dumb or worse than dumb saying meaningless thingsfoolish
lies And I see the affection I am longing for given to dogs and cats
and pet birds because they come and ask for it Almost whispering
It must be asked for it is like a ghost it cannot speak unless it is
first spoken to At his normal pitch but with deep melancholy All
the love in the world is longing to speak only it dare not because it
is shy shy shy That is the worlds tragedy With a deep sigh he
sits in the spare chair and buries his face in his hands

PROSERPINE amazed but keeping her wits about herher point of honor
in encounters with strange young men Wicked people get over that
shyness occasionally dont they

MARCHBANKS scrambling up almost fiercely Wicked people means people
who have no love therefore they have no shame They have the power to
ask love because they dont need it they have the power to offer it
because they have none to give He collapses into his seat and adds
mournfully But we who have love and long to mingle it with the love
of others we cannot utter a word Timidly You find that dont you

PROSERPINE Look here if you dont stop talking like this Ill leave
the room Mr Marchbanks I really will Its not proper She resumes
her seat at the typewriter opening the blue book and preparing to copy
a passage from it

MARCHBANKS hopelessly Nothing thats worth saying IS proper He
rises and wanders about the room in his lost way saying I cant
understand you Miss Garnett What am I to talk about

PROSERPINE snubbing him Talk about indifferent things talk about
the weather

MARCHBANKS Would you stand and talk about indifferent things if a
child were by crying bitterly with hunger

PROSERPINE I suppose not

MARCHBANKS Well I cant talk about indifferent things with my heart
crying out bitterly in ITS hunger

PROSERPINE Then hold your tongue

MARCHBANKS Yes that is what it always comes to We hold our tongues
Does that stop the cry of your heartfor it does cry doesnt it It
must if you have a heart

PROSERPINE suddenly rising with her hand pressed on her heart Oh
its no use trying to work while you talk like that She leaves her
little table and sits on the sofa Her feelings are evidently strongly
worked on Its no business of yours whether my heart cries or not
but I have a mind to tell you for all that

MARCHBANKS You neednt I know already that it must

PROSERPINE But mind if you ever say I said so Ill deny it

MARCHBANKS compassionately Yes I know And so you havent the
courage to tell him

PROSERPINE bouncing up HIM Who

MARCHBANKS Whoever he is The man you love It might be anybody The
curate Mr Mill perhaps

PROSERPINE with disdain Mr Mill A fine man to break my heart
about indeed Id rather have you than Mr Mill

MARCHBANKS recoiling No reallyIm very sorry but you mustnt
think of that I

PROSERPINE testily crossing to the fire and standing at it with her
back to him Oh dont be frightened its not you Its not any one
particular person

MARCHBANKS I know You feel that you could love anybody that offered

PROSERPINE exasperated Anybody that offered No I do not What do
you take me for

MARCHBANKS discouraged No use You wont make me REAL answersonly
those things that everybody says He strays to the sofa and sits down
disconsolately

PROSERPINE nettled at what she takes to be a disparagement of her
manners by an aristocrat Oh well if you want original conversation
youd better go and talk to yourself

MARCHBANKS That is what all poets do they talk to themselves out
loud and the world overhears them But its horribly lonely not to
hear someone else talk sometimes

PROSERPINE Wait until Mr Morell comes HELL talk to you Marchbanks
shudders Oh you neednt make wry faces over him he can talk better
than you With temper Hed talk your little head off She is going
back angrily to her place when suddenly enlightened he springs up
and stops her

MARCHBANKS Ah I understand now

PROSERPINE reddening What do you understand

MARCHBANKS Your secret Tell me is it really and truly possible for a
woman to love him

PROSERPINE as if this were beyond all bounds Well

MARCHBANKS passionately No answer me I want to know I MUST know
I cant understand it I can see nothing in him but words pious
resolutions what people call goodness You cant love that

PROSERPINE attempting to snub him by an air of cool propriety I
simply dont know what youre talking about I dont understand you

MARCHBANKS vehemently You do You lie

PROSERPINE Oh

MARCHBANKS You DO understand and you KNOW Determined to have an
answer Is it possible for a woman to love him

PROSERPINE looking him straight in the face Yes He covers his face
with his hands Whatever is the matter with you He takes down his
hands and looks at her Frightened at the tragic mask presented to her
she hurries past him at the utmost possible distance keeping her eyes
on his face until he turns from her and goes to the childs chair
beside the hearth where he sits in the deepest dejection As she
approaches the door it opens and Burgess enters On seeing him she
ejaculates Praise heaven heres somebody and sits down reassured
at her table She puts a fresh sheet of paper into the typewriter as
Burgess crosses to Eugene

BURGESS bent on taking care of the distinguished visitor Well so
this is the way they leave you to yourself Mr Morchbanks Ive come
to keep you company Marchbanks looks up at him in consternation
which is quite lost on him James is receivin a deppitation in the
dinin room and Candy is hupstairs educatin of a young stitcher gurl
shes hinterusted in Shes settin there learnin her to read out of
the Evnly Twins Condolingly You must find it lonesome here with
no one but the typist to talk to He pulls round the easy chair above
fire and sits down

PROSERPINE highly incensed Hell be all right now that he has the
advantage of YOUR polished conversation thats one comfort anyhow
She begins to typewrite with clattering asperity

BURGESS amazed at her audacity Hi was not addressin myself to you
young woman that Im awerr of

PROSERPINE tartly to Marchbanks Did you ever see worse manners Mr
Marchbanks

BURGESS with pompous severity Mr Morchbanks is a gentleman and
knows his place which is more than some people do

PROSERPINE fretfully Its well you and I are not ladies and
gentlemen Id talk to you pretty straight if Mr Marchbanks wasnt
here She pulls the letter out of the machine so crossly that it
tears There now Ive spoiled this letterhave to be done all over
again Oh I cant contain myselfsilly old fathead

BURGESS rising breathless with indignation Ho Im a silly ole
fathead am I Ho indeed gasping Hall right my gurl Hall right
You just wait till I tell that to your employer Youll see Ill teach

PROSERPINE I

BURGESS cutting her short No youve done it now No huse atalkin
to me Ill let you know who I am Proserpine shifts her paper
carriage with a defiant bang and disdainfully goes on with her work
Dont you take no notice of her Mr Morchbanks Shes beneath it He
sits down again loftily

MARCHBANKS miserably nervous and disconcerted Hadnt we better
change the subject II dont think Miss Garnett meant anything

PROSERPINE with intense conviction Oh didnt I though just

BURGESS I wouldnt demean myself to take notice on her

An electric bell rings twice

PROSERPINE gathering up her notebook and papers  Thats for me
She hurries out

BURGESS calling after her Oh we can spare you Somewhat relieved
by the triumph of having the last word and yet half inclined to try to
improve on it he looks after her for a moment then subsides into his
seat by Eugene and addresses him very confidentially Now were
alone Mr Morchbanks let me give you a friendly int that I wouldnt
give to everybody Ow long ave you known my soninlaw James here

MARCHBANKS I dont know I never can remember dates A few months

BURGESS impressively No more you wouldnt Thats the danger in it
Well hes mad

MARCHBANKS Mad

BURGESS Mad as a Morch are You take notice on him and youll see

MARCHBANKS beginning But surely that is only because his opinions

BURGESS touching him with his forefinger on his knee and pressing it
as if to hold his attention with it Thats wot I used tee think Mr
Morchbanks Hi thought long enough that it was honly is hopinions
though mind you hopinions becomes vurry serious things when people
takes to hactin on em as e does But thats not wot I go on He
looks round to make sure that they are alone and bends over to
Eugenes ear Wot do you think he says to me this mornin in this very
room

MARCHBANKS What

MORELL outside calling to Proserpine holding the door open Get

PROSERPINE in the distance Yes Mr Morell

Morell comes in with the deputations documents in his hands

BURGESS aside to Marchbanks Yorr he is Just you keep your heye on

complaint to you I dont want to do it but I feel I oughter as a

MORELL Whats the matter

solemnly Your young woman so far forgot herself as to call me a silly

MORELL delightedwith tremendous heartiness Oh now isnt that

Prossy Ha Ha

BURGESS trembling with rage And do you hexpec me to put up with it

MORELL Pooh nonsense you cant take any notice of it Never mind
He goes to the cellaret and puts the papers into one of the drawers

BURGESS Oh I dont mind Im above it But is it RIGHTthats what
I want to know Is it right

MORELL Thats a question for the Church not for the laity Has it
done you any harm thats the question for you eh Of course it
hasnt Think no more of it He dismisses the subject by going to his
place at the table and setting to work at his correspondence

BURGESS aside to Marchbanks What did I tell you Mad as a atter
He goes to the table and asks with the sickly civility of a hungry
man Whens dinner James

MORELL Not for half an hour yet

BURGESS with plaintive resignation Gimme a nice book to read over
the fire will you James thurs a good chap

MORELL What sort of book A good one

BURGESS with almost a yell of remonstrance Nahoo Summat pleasant
just to pass the time Morell takes an illustrated paper from the
table and offers it He accepts it humbly Thank yer James He goes
back to his easy chair at the fire and sits there at his ease
reading

MORELL as he writes Candida will come to entertain you presently
She has got rid of her pupil She is filling the lamps

MARCHBANKS starting up in the wildest consternation But that will
soil her hands I cant bear that Morell its a shame Ill go and
fill them He makes for the door

MORELL Youd better not Marchbanks stops irresolutely Shed only
set you to clean my boots to save me the trouble of doing it myself in
the morning

BURGESS with grave disapproval Dont you keep a servant now James

MORELL Yes but she isnt a slave and the house looks as if I kept
three That means that everyone has to lend a hand Its not a bad
plan Prossy and I can talk business after breakfast whilst were
washing up Washing ups no trouble when there are two people to do it

MARCHBANKS tormentedly Do you think every woman is as coarsegrained
as Miss Garnett

BURGESS emphatically Thats quite right Mr Morchbanks Thats
quite right She IS corsegrained

MORELL quietly and significantly Marchbanks

MARCHBANKS Yes

MORELL How many servants does your father keep

MARCHBANKS Oh I dont know He comes back uneasily to the sofa as
if to get as far as possible from Morells questioning and sits down
in great agony of mind thinking of the paraffin

MORELL very gravely So many that you dont know More
aggressively Anyhow when theres anything coarsegrained to be done
you ring the bell and throw it on to somebody else eh Thats one of
the great facts in YOUR existence isnt it

MARCHBANKS Oh dont torture me The one great fact now is that your
wifes beautiful fingers are dabbling in paraffin oil and that you are
sitting here comfortably preaching about iteverlasting preaching
preaching words words words

BURGESS intensely appreciating this retort Ha ha Devil a better
Radiantly Ad you there James straight

Candida comes in well aproned with a reading lamp trimmed filled
and ready for lighting She places it on the table near Morell ready
for use

CANDIDA brushing her finger tips together with a slight twitch of her
nose If you stay with us Eugene I think I will hand over the lamps
to you

MARCHBANKS I will stay on condition that you hand over all the rough
work to me

CANDIDA Thats very gallant but I think I should like to see how you
do it first Turning to Morell James youve not been looking after
the house properly

MORELL What have I doneor not donemy love

CANDIDA with serious vexation My own particular pet scrubbing brush
has been used for blackleading A heartbreaking wail bursts from
Marchbanks Burgess looks round amazed Candida hurries to the sofa
Whats the matter Are you ill Eugene

MARCHBANKS No not ill Only horror horror horror He bows his head
on his hands

BURGESS shocked What Got the orrors Mr Morchbanks Oh thats
bad at your age You must leave it off grajally

CANDIDA reassured Nonsense papa Its only poetic horror isnt it
Eugene Petting him

BURGESS abashed Oh poetic orror is it I beg your pordon Im
shore He turns to the fire again deprecating his hasty conclusion

CANDIDA What is it Eugenethe scrubbing brush He shudders Well
there never mind She sits down beside him Wouldnt you like to
present me with a nice new one with an ivory back inlaid with
motherofpearl

MARCHBANKS softly and musically but sadly and longingly No not a
scrubbing brush but a boata tiny shallop to sail away in far from
the world where the marble floors are washed by the rain and dried by
the sun where the south wind dusts the beautiful green and purple
carpets Or a chariotto carry us up into the sky where the lamps are
stars and dont need to be filled with paraffin oil every day

MORELL harshly And where there is nothing to do but to be idle
selfish and useless

CANDIDA jarred Oh James how could you spoil it all

MARCHBANKS firing up Yes to be idle selfish and useless that is
to be beautiful and free and happy hasnt every man desired that with
all his soul for the woman he loves Thats my ideal whats yours and
that of all the dreadful people who live in these hideous rows of
houses Sermons and scrubbing brushes With you to preach the sermon
and your wife to scrub

CANDIDA quaintly He cleans the boots Eugene You will have to clean
them tomorrow for saying that about him

MARCHBANKS Oh dont talk about boots Your feet should be beautiful
on the mountains

CANDIDA My feet would not be beautiful on the Hackney Road without
boots

BURGESS scandalized Come Candy dont be vulgar Mr Morchbanks
aint accustomed to it Youre givin him the orrors again I mean the
poetic ones

Morell is silent Apparently he is busy with his letters really he is
puzzling with misgiving over his new and alarming experience that the
surer he is of his moral thrusts the more swiftly and effectively
Eugene parries them To find himself beginning to fear a man whom he
does not respect affects him bitterly

Miss Garnett comes in with a telegram

PROSERPINE handing the telegram to Morell Reply paid The boys
waiting To Candida coming back to her machine and sitting down
Maria is ready for you now in the kitchen Mrs Morell Candida
rises The onions have come

MARCHBANKS convulsively Onions

CANDIDA Yes onions Not even Spanish onesnasty little red onions
You shall help me to slice them Come along

She catches him by the wrist and runs out pulling him after her
Burgess rises in consternation and stands aghast on the hearthrug
staring after them

BURGESS Candy didnt oughter andle a peers nevvy like that Its
goin too fur with it Lookee ere James do e often git taken queer
like that

MORELL shortly writing a telegram I dont know

BURGESS sentimentally He talks very pretty I allus had a turn for a
bit of potery Candy takes arter me thataway huse ter make me tell
her fairy stories when she was ony a little kiddy not that igh
indicating a stature of two feet or thereabouts

MORELL preoccupied Ah indeed He blots the telegram and goes out

PROSERPINE Used you to make the fairy stories up out of your own head

Burgess not deigning to reply strikes an attitude of the haughtiest
disdain on the hearthrug

PROSERPINE calmly I should never have supposed you had it in you By
the way Id better warn you since youve taken such a fancy to Mr
Marchbanks Hes mad

BURGESS Mad Wot Im too

PROSERPINE Mad as a March hare He did frighten me I can tell you
just before you came in that time Havent you noticed the queer things
he says

BURGESS So thats wot the poetic orrors means Blame me if it didnt
come into my head once or twyst that he must be off his chump He
crosses the room to the door lifting up his voice as he goes Well
this is a pretty sort of asylum for a man to be in with no one but you
to take care of him

PROSERPINE as he passes her Yes what a dreadful thing it would be
if anything happened to YOU

BURGESS loftily Dont you address no remarks to me Tell your
hemployer that Ive gone into the garden for a smoke

PROSERPINE mocking Oh

Before Burgess can retort Morell comes back

BURGESS sentimentally Goin for a turn in the garden to smoke James

MORELL brusquely Oh all right all right Burgess goes out
pathetically in the character of the weary old man Morell stands at
the table turning over his papers and adding across to Proserpine
half humorously half absently Well Miss Prossy why have you been
calling my fatherinlaw names

PROSERPINE blushing fiery red and looking quickly up at him half
scared half reproachful I She bursts into tears

MORELL with tender gaiety leaning across the table towards her and
consoling her Oh come come come Never mind Pross he IS a silly
old fathead isnt he

With an explosive sob she makes a dash at the door and vanishes
banging it Morell shaking his head resignedly sighs and goes
wearily to his chair where he sits down and sets to work looking old
and careworn

Candida comes in She has finished her household work and taken of the
apron She at once notices his dejected appearance and posts herself
quietly at the spare chair looking down at him attentively but she
says nothing

MORELL looking up but with his pen raised ready to resume his work
Well Where is Eugene

CANDIDA Washing his hands in the sculleryunder the tap He will make
an excellent cook if he can only get over his dread of Maria

MORELL shortly Ha No doubt He begins writing again

CANDIDA going nearer and putting her hand down softly on his to stop
him as she says Come here dear Let me look at you He drops his
pen and yields himself at her disposal She makes him rise and brings
him a little away from the table looking at him critically all the
time Turn your face to the light She places him facing the window
My boy is not looking well Has he been overworking

MORELL Nothing more than usual

CANDIDA He looks very pale and grey and wrinkled and old His
melancholy deepens and she attacks it with wilful gaiety Here
pulling him towards the easy chair youve done enough writing for
today Leave Prossy to finish it and come and talk to me

MORELL But

CANDIDA Yes I MUST be talked to sometimes She makes him sit down
and seats herself on the carpet beside his knee Now patting his
hand youre beginning to look better already Why dont you give up
all this tiresome overworkinggoing out every night lecturing and
talking Of course what you say is all very true and very right but it
does no good they dont mind what you say to them one little bit Of
course they agree with you but whats the use of people agreeing with
you if they go and do just the opposite of what you tell them the
moment your back is turned Look at our congregation at St Dominics
Why do they come to hear you talking about Christianity every Sunday
Why just because theyve been so full of business and moneymaking for
six days that they want to forget all about it and have a rest on the
seventh so that they can go back fresh and make money harder than
ever You positively help them at it instead of hindering them

MORELL with energetic seriousness You know very well Candida that
I often blow them up soundly for that But if there is nothing in their
churchgoing but rest and diversion why dont they try something more
amusingmore selfindulgent There must be some good in the fact that
they prefer St Dominics to worse places on Sundays

CANDIDA Oh the worst places arent open and even if they were they
darent be seen going to them Besides James dear you preach so
splendidly that its as good as a play for them Why do you think the
women are so enthusiastic

MORELL shocked Candida

CANDIDA Oh I know You silly boy you think its your Socialism and
your religion but if it was that theyd do what you tell them instead
of only coming to look at you They all have Prossys complaint

MORELL Prossys complaint What do you mean Candida

CANDIDA Yes Prossy and all the other secretaries you ever had Why
does Prossy condescend to wash up the things and to peel potatoes and
abase herself in all manner of ways for six shillings a week less than
she used to get in a city office Shes in love with you James thats
the reason Theyre all in love with you And you are in love with
preaching because you do it so beautifully And you think its all
enthusiasm for the kingdom of Heaven on earth and so do they You dear
silly

MORELL Candida what dreadful what souldestroying cynicism Are you
jesting Orcan it beare you jealous

CANDIDA with curious thoughtfulness Yes I feel a little jealous
sometimes

MORELL incredulously What Of Prossy

CANDIDA laughing No no no no Not jealous of anybody Jealous for
somebody else who is not loved as he ought to be

MORELL Me

CANDIDA You Why youre spoiled with love and worship you get far
more than is good for you No I mean Eugene

MORELL startled Eugene

CANDIDA It seems unfair that all the love should go to you and none
to him although he needs it so much more than you do A convulsive
movement shakes him in spite of himself Whats the matter Am I
worrying you

MORELL hastily Not at all Looking at her with troubled intensity
You know that I have perfect confidence in you Candida

CANDIDA You vain thing Are you so sure of your irresistible
attractions

MORELL Candida you are shocking me I never thought of my
attractions I thought of your goodnessyour purity That is what I
confide in

CANDIDA What a nasty uncomfortable thing to say to me Oh you ARE a
clergyman Jamesa thorough clergyman

MORELL turning away from her heartstricken So Eugene says

CANDIDA with lively interest leaning over to him with her arms on his
knee Eugenes always right Hes a wonderful boy I have grown fonder
and fonder of him all the time I was away Do you know James that
though he has not the least suspicion of it himself he is ready to
fall madly in love with me

MORELL grimly Oh he has no suspicion of it himself hasnt he

CANDIDA Not a bit She takes her arms from his knee and turns
thoughtfully sinking into a more restful attitude with her hands in
her lap Some day he will know when he is grown up and experienced
like you And he will know that I must have known I wonder what he
will think of me then

MORELL No evil Candida I hope and trust no evil

CANDIDA dubiously That will depend

MORELL bewildered Depend

CANDIDA looking at him Yes it will depend on what happens to him
He look vacantly at her Dont you see It will depend on how he
comes to learn what love really is I mean on the sort of woman who
will teach it to him

MORELL quite at a loss Yes No I dont know what you mean

CANDIDA explaining If he learns it from a good woman then it will
be all right he will forgive me

MORELL Forgive

CANDIDA But suppose he learns it from a bad woman as so many men do
especially poetic men who imagine all women are angels Suppose he
only discovers the value of love when he has thrown it away and
degraded himself in his ignorance Will he forgive me then do you
think

MORELL Forgive you for what

CANDIDA realizing how stupid he is and a little disappointed though
quite tenderly so Dont you understand He shakes his head She
turns to him again so as to explain with the fondest intimacy I
mean will he forgive me for not teaching him myself For abandoning
him to the bad women for the sake of my goodnessmy purity as you
call it Ah James how little you understand me to talk of your
confidence in my goodness and purity I would give them both to poor
Eugene as willingly as I would give my shawl to a beggar dying of cold
if there were nothing else to restrain me Put your trust in my love
for you James for if that went I should care very little for your
sermonsmere phrases that you cheat yourself and others with every
day She is about to rise

MORELL HIS words

CANDIDA checking herself quickly in the act of getting up so that she
is on her knees but upright Whose words

MORELL Eugenes

CANDIDA delighted He is always right He understands you he
understands me he understands Prossy and you Jamesyou understand
nothing She laughs and kisses him to console him He recoils as if
stung and springs up

MORELL How can you bear to do that whenoh Candida with anguish in
his voice I had rather you had plunged a grappling iron into my heart
than given me that kiss

CANDIDA rising alarmed My dear whats the matter

MORELL frantically waving her off Dont touch me

CANDIDA amazed James

They are interrupted by the entrance of Marchbanks with Burgess who
stops near the door staring whilst Eugene hurries forward between
them

MARCHBANKS Is anything the matter

MORELL deadly white putting an iron constraint on himself Nothing
but this that either you were right this morning or Candida is mad

BURGESS in loudest protest Wot Candy mad too Oh come come come
He crosses the room to the fireplace protesting as he goes and
knocks the ashes out of his pipe on the bars Morell sits down
desperately leaning forward to hide his face and interlacing his
fingers rigidly to keep them steady

CANDIDA to Morell relieved and laughing Oh youre only shocked Is
that all How conventional all you unconventional people are

BURGESS Come beave yourself Candy Whatll Mr Morchbanks think of
you

CANDIDA This comes of James teaching me to think for myself and never
to hold back out of fear of what other people may think of me It works
beautifully as long as I think the same things as he does But now
because I have just thought something differentlook at himjust
look

She points to Morell greatly amused Eugene looks and instantly
presses his band on his heart as if some deadly pain had shot through
it and sits down on the sofa like a man witnessing a tragedy

BURGESS on the hearthrug Well James you certainly aint as
himpressive lookin as usul

MORELL with a laugh which is half a sob I suppose not I beg all
your pardons I was not conscious of making a fuss Pulling himself
together Well well well well well He goes back to his place at
the table setting to work at his papers again with resolute
cheerfulness

CANDIDA going to the sofa and sitting beside Marchbanks still in a
bantering humor Well Eugene why are you so sad Did the onions make
you cry

Morell cannot prevent himself from watching them

MARCHBANKS aside to her It is your cruelty I hate cruelty It is a
horrible thing to see one person make another suffer

CANDIDA petting him ironically Poor boy have I been cruel Did I
make it slice nasty little red onions

MARCHBANKS earnestly Oh stop stop I dont mean myself You have
made him suffer frightfully I feel his pain in my own heart I know
that it is not your faultit is something that must happen but dont
make light of it I shudder when you torture him and laugh

CANDIDA incredulously I torture James Nonsense Eugene how you
exaggerate Silly She looks round at Morell who hastily resumes his
writing She goes to him and stands behind his chair bending over
him Dont work any more dear Come and talk to us

MORELL affectionately but bitterly Ah no I cant talk I can only
preach

CANDIDA caressing him Well come and preach

BURGESS strongly remonstrating Aw no Candy Ang it all Lexy
Mill comes in looking anxious and important

LEXY hastening to shake hands with Candida How do you do Mrs
Morell So glad to see you back again

CANDIDA Thank you Lexy You know Eugene dont you

LEXY Oh yes How do you do Marchbanks

MARCHBANKS Quite well thanks

LEXY to Morell Ive just come from the Guild of St Matthew They
are in the greatest consternation about your telegram Theres nothing
wrong is there

CANDIDA What did you telegraph about James

LEXY to Candida He was to have spoken for them tonight Theyve
taken the large hall in Mare Street and spent a lot of money on
posters Morells telegram was to say he couldnt come It came on them
like a thunderbolt

CANDIDA surprized and beginning to suspect something wrong Given up
an engagement to speak

BURGESS First time in his life Ill bet Ain it Candy

LEXY to Morell They decided to send an urgent telegram to you asking
whether you could not change your mind Have you received it

MORELL with restrained impatience Yes yes I got it

LEXY It was reply paid

MORELL Yes I know I answered it I cant go

CANDIDA But why James

MORELL almost fiercely Because I dont choose These people forget
that I am a man they think I am a talking machine to be turned on for
their pleasure every evening of my life May I not have ONE night at
home with my wife and my friends

They are all amazed at this outburst except Eugene His expression
remains unchanged

CANDIDA Oh James you know youll have an attack of bad conscience
tomorrow and I shall have to suffer for that

LEXY intimidated but urgent I know of course that they make the
most unreasonable demands on you But they have been telegraphing all
over the place for another speaker and they can get nobody but the
President of the Agnostic League

MORELL promptly Well an excellent man What better do they want

LEXY But he always insists so powerfully on the divorce of Socialism
from Christianity He will undo all the good we have been doing Of
course you know best butHe hesitates

CANDIDA coaxingly Oh DO go James Well all go

BURGESS grumbling Look ere Candy I say Lets stay at home by the
fire comfortable He wont need to be moren a coupleohour away

CANDIDA Youll be just as comfortable at the meeting Well all sit on
the platform and be great people

EUGENE terrified Oh please dont let us go on the platform
Noeveryone will stare at usI couldnt Ill sit at the back of the
room

CANDIDA Dont be afraid Theyll be too busy looking at James to
notice you

MORELL turning his head and looking meaningly at her over his
shoulder Prossys complaint Candida Eh

CANDIDA gaily Yes

BURGESS mystified Prossys complaint Wot are you talking about
James

MORELL not heeding him rises goes to the door and holds it open
shouting in a commanding voice Miss Garnett

PROSERPINE in the distance Yes Mr Morell Coming They all wait
except Burgess who goes stealthily to Lexy and draws him aside

BURGESS Listen here Mr Mill Wots Prossys complaint Wots wrong
with er

LEXY confidentially Well I dont exactly know but she spoke very
strangely to me this morning Im afraid shes a little out of her mind
sometimes

BURGESS overwhelmed Why it must be catchin Four in the same
ouse He goes back to the hearth quite lost before the instability
of the human intellect in a clergymans house

PROSERPINE appearing on the threshold What is it Mr Morell

MORELL Telegraph to the Guild of St Matthew that I am coming

PROSERPINE surprised Dont they expect you

MORELL peremptorily Do as I tell you

Proserpine frightened sits down at her typewriter and obeys Morell
goes across to Burgess Candida watching his movements all the time
with growing wonder and misgiving

MORELL Burgess you dont want to come

BURGESS in deprecation Oh dont put it like that James Its only
that it aint Sunday you know

MORELL Im sorry I thought you might like to be introduced to the
chairman Hes on the Works Committee of the County Council and has
some influence in the matter of contracts Burgess wakes up at once
Morell expecting as much waits a moment and says Will you come

BURGESS with enthusiasm Course Ill come James Ain it always a
pleasure to ear you

MORELL turning from him I shall want you to take some notes at the
meeting Miss Garnett if you have no other engagement She nods
afraid to speak You are coming Lexy I suppose

LEXY Certainly

CANDIDA We are all coming James

MORELL No you are not coming and Eugene is not coming You will stay
here and entertain himto celebrate your return home Eugene rises
breathless

CANDIDA But James

MORELL authoritatively I insist You do not want to come and he
does not want to come Candida is about to protest Oh dont concern
yourselves I shall have plenty of people without you your chairs will
be wanted by unconverted people who have never heard me before

CANDIDA troubled Eugene wouldnt you like to come

MORELL I should be afraid to let myself go before Eugene he is so
critical of sermons Looking at him He knows I am afraid of him he
told me as much this morning Well I shall show him how much afraid I
am by leaving him here in your custody Candida

MARCHBANKS to himself with vivid feeling Thats brave Thats
beautiful He sits down again listening with parted lips

CANDIDA with anxious misgiving ButbutIs anything the matter
James Greatly troubled I cant understand

MORELL Ah I thought it was I who couldnt understand dear He takes
her tenderly in his arms and kisses her on the forehead then looks
round quietly at Marchbanks



ACT III

Late in the evening Past ten The curtains are drawn and the lamps
lighted The typewriter is in its case the large table has been
cleared and tidied everything indicates that the days work is done

Candida and Marchbanks are seated at the fire The reading lamp is on
the mantelshelf above Marchbanks who is sitting on the small chair
reading aloud from a manuscript A little pile of manuscripts and a
couple of volumes of poetry are on the carpet beside him Candida is in
the easy chair with the poker a light brass one upright in her hand
She is leaning back and looking at the point of it curiously with her
feet stretched towards the blaze and her heels resting on the fender
profoundly unconscious of her appearance and surroundings

MARCHBANKS breaking off in his recitation Every poet that ever lived
has put that thought into a sonnet He must he cant help it He
looks to her for assent and notices her absorption in the poker
Havent you been listening No response Mrs Morell

CANDIDA starting Eh

MARCHBANKS Havent you been listening

CANDIDA with a guilty excess of politeness Oh yes Its very nice
Go on Eugene Im longing to hear what happens to the angel

MARCHBANKS crushedthe manuscript dropping from his hand to the
floor I beg your pardon for boring you

CANDIDA But you are not boring me I assure you Please go on Do
Eugene

MARCHBANKS I finished the poem about the angel quarter of an hour ago
Ive read you several things since

CANDIDA remorsefully Im so sorry Eugene I think the poker must
have fascinated me She puts it down

MARCHBANKS It made me horribly uneasy

CANDIDA Why didnt you tell me Id have put it down at once

MARCHBANKS I was afraid of making you uneasy too It looked as if it
were a weapon If I were a hero of old I should have laid my drawn
sword between us If Morell had come in he would have thought you had
taken up the poker because there was no sword between us

CANDIDA wondering What With a puzzled glance at him I cant
quite follow that Those sonnets of yours have perfectly addled me Why
should there be a sword between us

MARCHBANKS evasively Oh never mind He stoops to pick up the
manuscript

CANDIDA Put that down again Eugene There are limits to my appetite
for poetryeven your poetry Youve been reading to me for more than
two hoursever since James went out I want to talk

MARCHBANKS rising scared No I mustnt talk He looks round him in
his lost way and adds suddenly I think Ill go out and take a walk
in the park Making for the door

CANDIDA Nonsense its shut long ago Come and sit down on the
hearthrug and talk moonshine as you usually do I want to be amused
Dont you want to

MARCHBANKS in half terror half rapture Yes

CANDIDA Then come along She moves her chair back a little to make
room He hesitates then timidly stretches himself on the hearthrug
face upwards and throws back his head across her knees looking up at
her

MARCHBANKS Oh Ive been so miserable all the evening because I was
doing right Now Im doing wrong and Im happy

CANDIDA tenderly amused at him Yes Im sure you feel a great grown
up wicked deceiverquite proud of yourself arent you

MARCHBANKS raising his head quickly and turning a little to look round
at her Take care Im ever so much older than you if you only knew
He turns quite over on his knees with his hands clasped and his arms
on her lap and speaks with growing impulse his blood beginning to
stir May I say some wicked things to you

CANDIDA without the least fear or coldness quite nobly and with
perfect respect for his passion but with a touch of her wisehearted
maternal humor No But you may say anything you really and truly
feel Anything at all no matter what it is I am not afraid so long
as it is your real self that speaks and not a mere attitudea gallant
attitude or a wicked attitude or even a poetic attitude I put you on
your honor and truth Now say whatever you want to

MARCHBANKS the eager expression vanishing utterly from his lips and
nostrils as his eyes light up with pathetic spirituality Oh now I
cant say anything all the words I know belong to some attitude or
otherall except one

CANDIDA What one is that

MARCHBANKS softly losing himself in the music of the name Candida
Candida Candida Candida Candida I must say that now because you
have put me on my honor and truth and I never think or feel Mrs
Morell it is always Candida

CANDIDA Of course And what have you to say to Candida

MARCHBANKS Nothing but to repeat your name a thousand times Dont
you feel that every time is a prayer to you

CANDIDA Doesnt it make you happy to be able to pray

MARCHBANKS Yes very happy

CANDIDA Well that happiness is the answer to your prayer Do you want
anything more

MARCHBANKS in beatitude No I have come into heaven where want is
unknown

Morell comes in He halts on the threshold and takes in the scene at
a glance

MORELL grave and selfcontained I hope I dont disturb you Candida
starts up violently but without the smallest embarrassment laughing
at herself Eugene still kneeling saves himself from falling by
putting his hands on the seat of the chair and remains there staring
open mouthed at Morell

CANDIDA as she rises Oh James how you startled me I was so taken
up with Eugene that I didnt hear your latchkey How did the meeting
go off Did you speak well

MORELL I have never spoken better in my life

CANDIDA That was first rate How much was the collection

MORELL I forgot to ask

CANDIDA to Eugene He must have spoken splendidly or he would never
have forgotten that To Morell Where are all the others

MORELL They left long before I could get away I thought I should
never escape I believe they are having supper somewhere

CANDIDA in her domestic business tone Oh in that case Maria may go
to bed Ill tell her She goes out to the kitchen

MORELL looking sternly down at Marchbanks Well

MARCHBANKS squatting crosslegged on the hearthrug and actually at
ease with Morelleven impishly humorous Well

MORELL Have you anything to tell me

MARCHBANKS Only that I have been making a fool of myself here in
private whilst you have been making a fool of yourself in public

MORELL Hardly in the same way I think

MARCHBANKS scrambling upeagerly The very very VERY same way I
have been playing the good man just like you When you began your
heroics about leaving me here with Candida

MORELL involuntarily Candida

MARCHBANKS Oh yes Ive got that far Heroics are infectious I
caught the disease from you I swore not to say a word in your absence
that I would not have said a month ago in your presence

MORELL Did you keep your oath

MARCHBANKS suddenly perching himself grotesquely on the easy chair
I was ass enough to keep it until about ten minutes ago Up to that
moment I went on desperately reading to herreading my own
poemsanybodys poemsto stave off a conversation I was standing
outside the gate of Heaven and refusing to go in Oh you cant think
how heroic it was and how uncomfortable Then

MORELL steadily controlling his suspense Then

MARCHBANKS prosaically slipping down into a quite ordinary attitude in
the chair Then she couldnt bear being read to any longer

MORELL And you approached the gate of Heaven at last

MARCHBANKS Yes

MORELL Well Fiercely Speak man have you no feeling for me

MARCHBANKS softly and musically Then she became an angel and there
was a flaming sword that turned every way so that I couldnt go in
for I saw that that gate was really the gate of Hell

MORELL triumphantly She repulsed you

MARCHBANKS rising in wild scorn No you fool if she had done that I
should never have seen that I was in Heaven already Repulsed me You
think that would have saved mevirtuous indignation Oh you are not
worthy to live in the same world with her He turns away
contemptuously to the other side of the room

MORELL who has watched him quietly without changing his place Do you
think you make yourself more worthy by reviling me Eugene

MARCHBANKS Here endeth the thousand and first lesson Morell I dont
think much of your preaching after all I believe I could do it better
myself The man I want to meet is the man that Candida married

MORELL The man that Do you mean me

MARCHBANKS I dont mean the Reverend James Mavor Morell moralist and
windbag I mean the real man that the Reverend James must have hidden
somewhere inside his black coatthe man that Candida loved You cant
make a woman like Candida love you by merely buttoning your collar at
the back instead of in front

MORELL boldly and steadily When Candida promised to marry me I was
the same moralist and windbag that you now see I wore my black coat
and my collar was buttoned behind instead of in front Do you think she
would have loved me any the better for being insincere in my profession

MARCHBANKS on the sofa hugging his ankles Oh she forgave you just
as she forgives me for being a coward and a weakling and what you
call a snivelling little whelp and all the rest of it Dreamily A
woman like that has divine insight she loves our souls and not our
follies and vanities and illusions or our collars and coats or any
other of the rags and tatters we are rolled up in He reflects on this
for an instant then turns intently to question Morell What I want to
know is how you got past the flaming sword that stopped me

MORELL meaningly Perhaps because I was not interrupted at the end of
ten minutes

MARCHBANKS taken aback What

MORELL Man can climb to the highest summits but he cannot dwell there
long

MARCHBANKS Its false there can he dwell for ever and there only
Its in the other moments that he can find no rest no sense of the
silent glory of life Where would you have me spend my moments if not
on the summits

MORELL In the scullery slicing onions and filling lamps

MARCHBANKS Or in the pulpit scrubbing cheap earthenware souls

MORELL Yes that too It was there that I earned my golden moment
and the right in that moment to ask her to love me I did not take
the moment on credit nor did I use it to steal another mans happiness

MARCHBANKS rather disgustedly trotting back towards the fireplace I
have no doubt you conducted the transaction as honestly as if you were
buying a pound of cheese He stops on the brink of the hearthrug and
adds thoughtfully to himself with his back turned to Morell I could
only go to her as a beggar

MORELL starting A beggar dying of coldasking for her shawl

MARCHBANKS turning surprised Thank you for touching up my poetry
Yes if you like a beggar dying of cold asking for her shawl

MORELL excitedly And she refused Shall I tell you why she refused
I CAN tell you on her own authority It was because of

MARCHBANKS She didnt refuse

MORELL Not

MARCHBANKS She offered me all I chose to ask for her shawl her
wings the wreath of stars on her head the lilies in her hand the
crescent moon beneath her feet

MORELL seizing him Out with the truth man my wife is my wife I
want no more of your poetic fripperies I know well that if I have lost
her love and you have gained it no law will bind her

MARCHBANKS quaintly without fear or resistance Catch me by the
shirt collar Morell she will arrange it for me afterwards as she did
this morning With quiet rapture I shall feel her hands touch me

MORELL You young imp do you know how dangerous it is to say that to
me Or with a sudden misgiving has something made you brave

MARCHBANKS Im not afraid now I disliked you before that was why I
shrank from your touch But I saw todaywhen she tortured youthat
you love her Since then I have been your friend you may strangle me
if you like

MORELL releasing him Eugene if that is not a heartless lieif you
have a spark of human feeling left in youwill you tell me what has
happened during my absence

MARCHBANKS What happened Why the flaming swordMorell stamps with
impatience Well in plain prose I loved her so exquisitely that I
wanted nothing more than the happiness of being in such love And
before I had time to come down from the highest summits you came in

MORELL suffering deeply So it is still unsettledstill the misery
of doubt

MARCHBANKS Misery I am the happiest of men I desire nothing now but
her happiness With dreamy enthusiasm Oh Morell let us both give
her up Why should she have to choose between a wretched little nervous
disease like me and a pigheaded parson like you Let us go on a
pilgrimage you to the east and I to the west in search of a worthy
lover for hersome beautiful archangel with purple wings

MORELL Some fiddlestick Oh if she is mad enough to leave me for you
who will protect her Who will help her who will work for her who
will be a father to her children He sits down distractedly on the
sofa with his elbows on his knees and his head propped on his clenched
fists

MARCHBANKS snapping his fingers wildly She does not ask those silly
questions It is she who wants somebody to protect to help to work
forsomebody to give her children to protect to help and to work for
Some grown up man who has become as a little child again Oh you fool
you fool you triple fool I am the man Morell I am the man He
dances about excitedly crying You dont understand what a woman is
Send for her Morell send for her and let her choose betweenThe
door opens and Candida enters He stops as if petrified

CANDIDA amazed on the threshold What on earth are you at Eugene

MARCHBANKS oddly James and I are having a preaching match and he is
getting the worst of it Candida looks quickly round at Morell Seeing
that he is distressed she hurries down to him greatly vexed speaking
with vigorous reproach to Marchbanks

CANDIDA You have been annoying him Now I wont have it Eugene do
you hear Putting her hand on Morells shoulder and quite forgetting
her wifely tact in her annoyance My boy shall not be worried I will
protect him

MORELL rising proudly Protect

CANDIDA not heeding himto Eugene What have you been saying

MARCHBANKS appalled Nothing

CANDIDA Eugene Nothing

MARCHBANKS piteously I meanIIm very sorry I wont do it again
indeed I wont Ill let him alone

MORELL indignantly with an aggressive movement towards Eugene Let
me alone You young

CANDIDA Stopping him Shno let me deal with him James

MARCHBANKS Oh youre not angry with me are you

CANDIDA severely Yes I amvery angry I have a great mind to pack
you out of the house

MORELL taken aback by Candidas vigor and by no means relishing the
sense of being rescued by her from another man Gently Candida
gently I am able to take care of myself

CANDIDA petting him Yes dear of course you are But you mustnt be
annoyed and made miserable

MARCHBANKS almost in tears turning to the door Ill go

CANDIDA Oh you neednt go I cant turn you out at this time of
night Vehemently Shame on you For shame

MARCHBANKS desperately But what have I done

CANDIDA I know what you have doneas well as if I had been here all
the time Oh it was unworthy You are like a child you cannot hold
your tongue

MARCHBANKS I would die ten times over sooner than give you a moments
pain

CANDIDA with infinite contempt for this puerility Much good your
dying would do me

MORELL Candida my dear this altercation is hardly quite seemingly
It is a matter between two men and I am the right person to settle it

CANDIDA Two MEN Do you call that a man To Eugene You bad boy

MARCHBANKS gathering a whimsically affectionate courage from the
scolding If I am to be scolded like this I must make a boys excuse
He began it And hes bigger than I am

CANDIDA losing confidence a little as her concern for Morells dignity
takes the alarm That cant be true To Morell You didnt begin it
James did you

MORELL contemptuously No

MARCHBANKS indignant Oh

MORELL to Eugene YOU began itthis morning Candida instantly
connecting this with his mysterious allusion in the afternoon to
something told him by Eugene in the morning looks quickly at him
wrestling with the enigma Morell proceeds with the emphasis of
offended superiority But your other point is true I am certainly the
bigger of the two and I hope the stronger Candida So you had
better leave the matter in my hands

CANDIDA again soothing him Yes dear butTroubled I dont
understand about this morning

MORELL gently snubbing her You need not understand my dear

CANDIDA But James IThe street bell rings Oh bother Here they
all come She goes out to let them in

MARCHBANKS running to Morell  Oh Morell isnt it dreadful Shes
angry with us she hates me What shall I do

MORELL with quaint desperation clutching himself by the hair
Eugene my head is spinning round I shall begin to laugh presently
He walks up and down the middle of the room

MARCHBANKS following him anxiously No no shell think Ive thrown
you into hysterics Dont laugh Boisterous voices and laughter are
heard approaching Lexy Mill his eyes sparkling and his bearing
denoting unwonted elevation of spirit enters with Burgess who is
greasy and selfcomplacent but has all his wits about him Miss
Garnett with her smartest hat and jacket on follows them but though
her eyes are brighter than before she is evidently a prey to
misgiving She places herself with her back to her typewriting table
with one hand on it to rest herself passes the other across her
forehead as if she were a little tired and giddy Marchbanks relapses
into shyness and edges away into the corner near the window where
Morells books are

MILL exhilaratedly Morell I MUST congratulate you Grasping his
hand What a noble splendid inspired address you gave us You
surpassed yourself

BURGESS So you did James It fair kep me awake to the last word
Didnt it Miss Garnett

PROSERPINE worriedly Oh I wasnt minding you I was trying to make
notes She takes out her notebook and looks at her stenography
which nearly makes her cry

MORELL Did I go too fast Pross

PROSERPINE Much too fast You know I cant do more than a hundred
words a minute She relieves her feelings by throwing her notebook
angrily beside her machine ready for use next morning

MORELL soothingly Oh well well never mind never mind never
mind Have you all had supper

LEXY Mr Burgess has been kind enough to give us a really splendid
supper at the Belgrave

BURGESS with effusive magnanimity Dont mention it Mr Mill
Modestly Youre arty welcome to my little treat

PROSERPINE We had champagne I never tasted it before I feel quite
giddy

MORELL surprised A champagne supper That was very handsome Was it
my eloquence that produced all this extravagance

MILL rhetorically Your eloquence and Mr Burgesss goodness of
heart With a fresh burst of exhilaration And what a very fine
fellow the chairman is Morell He came to supper with us

MORELL with long drawn significance looking at Burgess Oooh the
chairman NOW I understand

Burgess covering a lively satisfaction in his diplomatic cunning with
a deprecatory cough retires to the hearth Lexy folds his arms and
leans against the cellaret in a highspirited attitude Candida comes
in with glasses lemons and a jug of hot water on a tray

CANDIDA Who will have some lemonade You know our rules total
abstinence She puts the tray on the table and takes up the lemon
squeezers looking enquiringly round at them

MORELL No use dear Theyve all had champagne Pross has broken her
pledge

CANDIDA to Proserpine You dont mean to say youve been drinking
champagne

PROSERPINE stubbornly Yes I do Im only a beer teetotaller not a
champagne teetotaller I dont like beer Are there any letters for me
to answer Mr Morell

MORELL No more tonight

PROSERPINE Very well Goodnight everybody

LEXY gallantly Had I not better see you home Miss Garnett

PROSERPINE No thank you I shant trust myself with anybody tonight
I wish I hadnt taken any of that stuff She walks straight out

BURGESS indignantly Stuff indeed That gurl dunno wot champagne is
Pommery and Greeno at twelve and six a bottle She took two glasses
amost straight hoff

MORELL a little anxious about her Go and look after her Lexy

LEXY alarmed But if she should really beSuppose she began to sing
in the street or anything of that sort

MORELL Just so she may Thats why youd better see her safely home

CANDIDA Do Lexy theres a good fellow She shakes his hand and
pushes him gently to the door

LEXY Its evidently my duty to go I hope it may not be necessary
Goodnight Mrs Morell To the rest Goodnight He goes Candida
shuts the door

BURGESS He was gushin with hextra piety hisself arter two sips
People carnt drink like they huseter Dismissing the subject and
bustling away from the hearth Well James its time to lock up Mr
Morchbanks shall I ave the pleasure of your company for a bit of the
way home

MARCHBANKS affrightedly Yes Id better go He hurries across to
the door but Candida places herself before it barring his way

CANDIDA with quiet authority You sit down Youre not going yet

MARCHBANKS quailing No II didnt mean to He comes back into the
room and sits down abjectly on the sofa

CANDIDA Mr Marchbanks will stay the night with us papa

BURGESS Oh well Ill say goodnight So long James He shakes
hands with Morell and goes on to Eugene Make em give you a night
light by your bed Mr Morchbanks itll comfort you if you wake up in
the night with a touch of that complaint of yores Goodnight

MARCHBANKS Thank you I will Goodnight Mr Burgess They shake
hands and Burgess goes to the door

CANDIDA intercepting Morell who is following Burgess Stay here
dear Ill put on papas coat for him She goes out with Burgess

MARCHBANKS Morell theres going to be a terrible scene Arent you
afraid

MORELL Not in the least

MARCHBANKS I never envied you your courage before He rises timidly
and puts his hand appealingly on Morells forearm Stand by me wont
you

MORELL casting him off gently but resolutely Each for himself
Eugene She must choose between us now He goes to the other side of
the room as Candida returns Eugene sits down again on the sofa like a
guilty schoolboy on his best behaviour

CANDIDA between them addressing Eugene Are you sorry

MARCHBANKS earnestly Yes heartbroken

CANDIDA Well then you are forgiven Now go off to bed like a good
little boy I want to talk to James about you

MARCHBANKS rising in great consternation Oh I cant do that
Morell I must be here Ill not go away Tell her

CANDIDA with quick suspicion Tell me what His eyes avoid hers
furtively She turns and mutely transfers the question to Morell

MORELL bracing himself for the catastrophe I have nothing to tell
her except here his voice deepens to a measured and mournful
tenderness that she is my greatest treasure on earthif she is really
mine

CANDIDA coldly offended by his yielding to his orators instinct and
treating her as if she were the audience at the Guild of St Matthew
I am sure Eugene can say no less if that is all

MARCHBANKS discouraged Morell shes laughing at us

MORELL with a quick touch of temper There is nothing to laugh at
Are you laughing at us Candida

CANDIDA with quiet anger Eugene is very quickwitted James I hope
I am going to laugh but I am not sure that I am not going to be very
angry She goes to the fireplace and stands there leaning with her
arm on the mantelpiece and her foot on the fender whilst Eugene steals
to Morell and plucks him by the sleeve

MARCHBANKS whispering Stop Morell Dont let us say anything

MORELL pushing Eugene away without deigning to look at him I hope
you dont mean that as a threat Candida

CANDIDA with emphatic warning Take care James Eugene I asked you
to go Are you going

MORELL putting his foot down He shall not go I wish him to remain

MARCHBANKS Ill go Ill do whatever you want He turns to the door

CANDIDA Stop He obeys Didnt you hear James say he wished you to
stay James is master here Dont you know that

MARCHBANKS flushing with a young poets rage against tyranny By what
right is he master

CANDIDA quietly Tell him James

MORELL taken aback My dear I dont know of any right that makes me
master I assert no such right

CANDIDA with infinite reproach You dont know Oh James James To
Eugene musingly I wonder do you understand Eugene No youre too
young Well I give you leave to stayto stay and learn She comes
away from the hearth and places herself between them Now James
whats the matter Come tell me

MARCHBANKS whispering tremulously across to him Dont

CANDIDA Come Out with it

MORELL slowly I meant to prepare your mind carefully Candida so as
to prevent misunderstanding

CANDIDA Yes dear I am sure you did But never mind I shant
misunderstand

MORELL WellerHe hesitates unable to find the long explanation
which he supposed to be available

CANDIDA Well

MORELL baldly Eugene declares that you are in love with him

MARCHBANKS frantically No no no no never I did not Mrs
Morell its not true I said I loved you and that he didnt I said
that I understood you and that he couldnt And it was not after what
passed there before the fire that I spoke it was not on my word It
was this morning

CANDIDA enlightened This morning

MARCHBANKS Yes He looks at her pleading for credence and then
adds simply That was what was the matter with my collar

CANDIDA after a pause for she does not take in his meaning at once
His collar She turns to Morell shocked Oh James did youshe
stops

MORELL ashamed You know Candida that I have a temper to struggle
with And he said shuddering that you despised me in your heart

CANDIDA turning quickly on Eugene Did you say that

MARCHBANKS terrified No

CANDIDA severely Then James has just told me a falsehood Is that
what you mean

MARCHBANKS No no II blurting out the explanation desperately
it was Davids wife And it wasnt at home it was when she saw him
dancing before all the people

MORELL taking the cue with a debaters adroitness Dancing before all
the people Candida and thinking he was moving their hearts by his
mission when they were only suffering fromProssys complaint She is
about to protest he raises his hand to silence her exclaiming Dont
try to look indignant Candida

CANDIDA interjecting Try

MORELL continuing Eugene was right As you told me a few hours
after he is always right He said nothing that you did not say far
better yourself He is the poet who sees everything and I am the poor
parson who understands nothing

CANDIDA remorsefully Do you mind what is said by a foolish boy
because I said something like it again in jest

MORELL That foolish boy can speak with the inspiration of a child and
the cunning of a serpent He has claimed that you belong to him and not
to me and rightly or wrongly I have come to fear that it may be
true I will not go about tortured with doubts and suspicions I will
not live with you and keep a secret from you I will not suffer the
intolerable degradation of jealousy We have agreedhe and Ithat you
shall choose between us now I await your decision

CANDIDA slowly recoiling a step her heart hardened by his rhetoric in
spite of the sincere feeling behind it Oh I am to choose am I I
suppose it is quite settled that I must belong to one or the other

MORELL firmly Quite You must choose definitely

MARCHBANKS anxiously Morell you dont understand She means that
she belongs to herself

CANDIDA turning on him I mean that and a good deal more Master
Eugene as you will both find out presently And pray my lords and
masters what have you to offer for my choice I am up for auction it
seems What do you bid James

MORELL reproachfully Cand He breaks down his eyes and throat
fill with tears the orator becomes the wounded animal I cant speak

CANDIDA impulsively going to him Ah dearest

MARCHBANKS in wild alarm Stop its not fair You mustnt show her
that you suffer Morell I am on the rack too but I am not crying

MORELL rallying all his forces Yes you are right It is not for
pity that I am bidding He disengages himself from Candida

CANDIDA retreating chilled I beg your pardon James I did not mean
to touch you I am waiting to hear your bid

MORELL with proud humility I have nothing to offer you but my
strength for your defence my honesty of purpose for your surety my
ability and industry for your livelihood and my authority and position
for your dignity That is all it becomes a man to offer to a woman

CANDIDA quite quietly And you Eugene What do you offer

MARCHBANKS My weakness my desolation my hearts need

CANDIDA impressed Thats a good bid Eugene Now I know how to make
my choice

She pauses and looks curiously from one to the other as if weighing
them Morell whose lofty confidence has changed into heartbreaking
dread at Eugenes bid loses all power of concealing his anxiety
Eugene strung to the highest tension does not move a muscle

MORELL in a suffocated voicethe appeal bursting from the depths of
his anguish Candida

MARCHBANKS aside in a flash of contempt Coward

CANDIDA significantly I give myself to the weaker of the two

Eugene divines her meaning at once his face whitens like steel in a
furnace that cannot melt it

MORELL bowing his head with the calm of collapse I accept your
sentence Candida

CANDIDA Do you understand Eugene

MARCHBANKS Oh I feel Im lost He cannot bear the burden

MORELL incredulously raising his bead with prosaic abruptness Do
you mean me Candida

CANDIDA smiling a little Let us sit and talk comfortably over it
like three friends To Morell Sit down dear Morell takes the
chair from the firesidethe childrens chair Bring me that chair
Eugene She indicates the easy chair He fetches it silently even
with something like cold strength and places it next Morell a little
behind him She sits down He goes to the sofa and sits there still
silent and inscrutable When they are all settled she begins throwing
a spell of quietness on them by her calm sane tender tone You
remember what you told me about yourself Eugene how nobody has cared
for you since your old nurse died how those clever fashionable
sisters and successful brothers of yours were your mothers and
fathers pets how miserable you were at Eton how your father is
trying to starve you into returning to Oxford how you have had to live
without comfort or welcome or refuge always lonely and nearly always
disliked and misunderstood poor boy

MARCHBANKS faithful to the nobility of his lot I had my books I had
Nature And at last I met you

CANDIDA Never mind that just at present Now I want you to look at
this other boy hereMY boyspoiled from his cradle We go once a
fortnight to see his parents You should come with us Eugene and see
the pictures of the hero of that household James as a baby the most
wonderful of all babies James holding his first school prize won at
the ripe age of eight James as the captain of his eleven James in his
first frock coat James under all sorts of glorious circumstances You
know how strong he is I hope he didnt hurt youhow clever he
ishow happy With deepening gravity Ask Jamess mother and his
three sisters what it cost to save James the trouble of doing anything
but be strong and clever and happy Ask ME what it costs to be Jamess
mother and three sisters and wife and mother to his children all in
one Ask Prossy and Maria how troublesome the house is even when we
have no visitors to help us to slice the onions Ask the tradesmen who
want to worry James and spoil his beautiful sermons who it is that puts
them off When there is money to give he gives it when there is money
to refuse I refuse it I build a castle of comfort and indulgence and
love for him and stand sentinel always to keep little vulgar cares
out I make him master here though he does not know it and could not
tell you a moment ago how it came to be so With sweet irony And
when he thought I might go away with you his only anxiety was what
should become of ME And to tempt me to stay he offered me leaning
forward to stroke his hair caressingly at each phrase his strength for
MY defence his industry for my livelihood his position for my
dignity his Relenting Ah I am mixing up your beautiful sentences
and spoiling them am I not darling She lays her cheek fondly
against his

MORELL quite overcome kneeling beside her chair and embracing her
with boyish ingenuousness Its all true every word What I am you
have made me with the labor of your hands and the love of your heart
You are my wife my mother my sisters you are the sum of all loving
care to me

CANDIDA in his arms smiling to Eugene Am I YOUR mother and sisters
to you Eugene

MARCHBANKS rising with a fierce gesture of disgust Ah never Out
then into the night with me

CANDIDA rising quickly and intercepting him You are not going like
that Eugene

MARCHBANKS with the ring of a mans voiceno longer a boysin the
words I know the hour when it strikes I am impatient to do what must
be done

MORELL rising from his knee alarmed Candida dont let him do
anything rash

CANDIDA confident smiling at Eugene Oh there is no fear He has
learnt to live without happiness

MARCHBANKS I no longer desire happiness life is nobler than that
Parson James I give you my happiness with both hands I love you
because you have filled the heart of the woman I loved Goodbye He
goes towards the door

CANDIDA One last word He stops but without turning to her How old
are you Eugene

MARCHBANKS As old as the world now This morning I was eighteen

CANDIDA going to him and standing behind him with one hand
caressingly on his shoulder Eighteen Will you for my sake make a
little poem out of the two sentences I am going to say to you And will
you promise to repeat it to yourself whenever you think of me

MARCHBANKS without moving Say the sentences

CANDIDA When I am thirty she will be fortyfive When I am sixty she
will be seventyfive

MARCHBANKS turning to her In a hundred years we shall be the same
age But I have a better secret than that in my heart Let me go now
The night outside grows impatient

CANDIDA Goodbye She takes his face in her hands and as he divines
her intention and bends his knee she kisses his forehead Then he
flies out into the night She turns to Morell holding out her arms to
him Ah James They embrace But they do not know the secret in the
poets heart
