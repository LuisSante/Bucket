                     MOSSES FROM AN OLD MANSE

                      By Nathaniel Hawthorne

                       BUDS AND BIRD VOICES



Balmy Springweeks later than we expected and months later than we
longed for hercomes at last to revive the moss on the roof and
walls of our old mansion  She peeps brightly into my studywindow
inviting me to throw it open and create a summer atmosphere by the
intermixture of her genial breath with the black and cheerless
comfort of the stove  As the casement ascends forth into infinite
space fly the innumerable forms of thought or fancy that have kept me
company in the retirement of this little chamber during the sluggish
lapse of wintry weather visions gay grotesque and sad pictures
of real life tinted with natures homely gray and russet scenes in
dreamland bedizened with rainbow hues which faded before they were
well laid onall these may vanish now and leave me to mould a
fresh existence out of sunshine Brooding Meditation may flap her
dusky wings and take her owllike Right blinking amid the
cheerfulness of noontide  Such companions befit the season of
frosted windowpanes and crackling fires when the blast howls
through the blackash trees of our avenue and the drifting snowstorm
chokes up the woodpaths and fills the highway from stone wall
to stone wall  In the spring and summer time all sombre thoughts
should follow the winter northward with the sombre and thoughtful
crows The old paradisiacal economy of life is again in force we
live not to think or to labor but for the simple end of being
happy Nothing for the present hour is worthy of mans infinite
capacity save to imbibe the warm smile of heaven and sympathize with
the reviving earth

The present Spring comes onward with fleeter footsteps because
Winter lingered so unconscionably long that with her best diligence
she can hardly retrieve half the allotted period of her reign  It
is but a fortnight since I stood on the brink of our swollen river
and beheld the accumulated ice of four frozen months go down the
stream  Except in streaks here and there upon the hillsides the
whole visible universe was then covered with deep snow the
nethermost layer of which had been deposited by an early December
storm  It was a sight to make the beholder torpid in the
impossibility of imagining how this vast white napkin was to be
removed from the face of the corpselike world in less time than had
been required to spread it there  But who can estimate the power of
gentle influences whether amid material desolation or the moral
winter of mans heart  There have been no tempestuous rains even
no sultry days but a constant breath of southern winds with now a
day of kindly sunshine and now a no less kindly mist or a soft
descent of showers in which a smile and a blessing seemed to have
been steeped  The snow has vanished as if by magic whatever heaps
may be hidden in the woods and deep gorges of the hills only two
solitary specks remain in the landscape and those I shall almost
regret to miss when tomorrow I look for them in vain  Never
before methinks has spring pressed so closely on the footsteps of
retreating winter  Along the roadside the green blades of grass
have sprouted on the very edge of the snowdrifts  The pastures and
mowingfields have not vet assumed a general aspect of verdure but
neither have they the cheerlessbrown tint which they wear in latter
autumn when vegetation has entirely ceased there is now a faint
shadow of life gradually brightening into the warm reality  Some
tracts in a happy exposureas for instance yonder southwestern
slope of an orchard in front of that old red farmhouse beyond the
riversuch patches of land already wear a beautiful and tender
green to which no future luxuriance can add a charm  It looks
unreal a prophecy a hope a transitory effect of sonic peculiar
light which will vanish with the slightest motion of the eye  But
beauty is never a delusion not these verdant tracts but the dark
and barren landscape all around them is a shadow and a dream  Each
moment wins seine portion of the earth from death to life a sudden
gleam of verdure brightens along the sunny slope of a bank which an
instant ago was brown and bare  You look again and behold an
apparition of green grass

The trees in our orchard and elsewhere are as yet naked but already
appear full of life and vegetable blood  It seems as if by one
magic touch they might instantaneously burst into full foliage and
that the wind which now sighs through their naked branches might
make sudden music amid innumerable leaves  The mossgrown
willowtree which for forty years past has overshadowed these western
windows will be among the first to put on its green attire  There
are some objections to the willow it is not a dry and cleanly tree
and impresses the beholder with an association of sliminess  No
trees I think are perfectly agreeable as companions unless they
have glossy leaves dry bark and a firm and hard texture of trunk
and branches  But the willow is almost the earliest to gladden us
with the promise and reality of beauty in its graceful and delicate
foliage and the last to scatter its yellow yet scarcely withered
leaves upon the ground  All through the winter too its yellow
twigs give it a sunny aspect which is not without a cheering
influence even in the grayest and gloomiest day  Beneath a clouded
sky it faithfully remembers the sunshine  Our old house would lose
a charm were the willow to be cut down with its golden crown over
the snowcovered roof and its heap of summer verdure

The lilacshrubs under my studywindows are likewise almost in leaf
in two or three days more I may put forth my hand and pluck the
topmost bough in its freshest green  These lilacs are very aged
and have lost the luxuriant foliage of their prime  The heart or
the judgment or the moral sense or the taste is dissatisfied with
their present aspect  Old age is not venerable when it embodies
itself in lilacs rosebushes or any other ornamental shrub it
seems as if such plants as they grow only for beauty ought to
flourish always in immortal youth or at least to die before their
sad decrepitude  Trees of beauty are trees of paradise and
therefore not subject to decay by their original nature though they
have lost that precious birthright by being transplanted to an
earthly soil  There is a kind of ludicrous unfitness in the idea of
a timestricken and grandfatherly lilacbush  The analogy holds
good in human life Persons who can only be graceful and ornamentalwho
can give the world nothing but flowersshould die young and
never be seen with gray hair and wrinkles any more than the
flowershrubs with mossy bark and blighted foliage like the lilacs under
my window Not that beauty is worthy of less than immortality no
the beautiful should live foreverand thence perhaps the sense
of impropriety when we see it triumphed over by time  Appletrees
on the other hand grow old without reproach  Let them live as long
as they may and contort themselves into whatever perversity of
shape they please and deck their withered limbs with a springtime
gaudiness of pink blossoms still they are respectable even if they
afford us only an apple or two in a season  Those few applesor
at all events the remembrance of apples in bygone yearsare the
atonement which utilitarianism inexorably demands for the privilege
of lengthened life  Human flowershrubs if they will grow old on
earth should besides their lovely blossoms bear some kind of
fruit that will satisfy earthly appetites else neither man nor the
decorum of nature will deem it fit that the moss should gather on
them

One of the first things that strikes the attention when the white
sheet of winter is withdrawn is the neglect and disarray that lay
hidden beneath it  Nature is not cleanly according to our
prejudices  The beauty of preceding years now transformed to brown
and blighted deformity obstructs the brightening loveliness of the
present hour  Our avenue is strewn with the whole crop of autumns
withered leaves  There are quantities of decayed branches which one
tempest after another has flung down black and rotten and one or
two with the ruin of a birdsnest clinging to them  In the garden
are the dried beanvines the brown stalks of the asparagusbed and
melancholy old cabbages which were frozen into the soil before their
unthrifty cultivator could find time to gather them  How
invariably throughout all the forms of life do we find these
intermingled memorials of death  On the soil of thought and in the
garden of the heart as well as in the sensual world he withered
leavesthe ideas and feelings that we have done with  There is no
wind strong enough to sweep them away infinite space will not
garner then from our sight  What mean they  Why may we not be
permitted to live and enjoy as if this were the first life and our
own the primal enjoyment instead of treading always on these dry
hones and mouldering relics from the aged accumulation of which
springs all that now appears so young and new  Sweet must have been
the springtime of Eden when no earlier year had strewn its decay
upon the virgin turf and no former experience had ripened into
summer and faded into autumn in the hearts of its inhabitants That
was a world worth living in  O then murmurer it is out of the very
wantonness of such a life that then feignest these idle
lamentations  There is no decay  Each human soul is the firstcreated
inhabitant of its own Eden  We dwell in an old mosscovered
mansion and tread in the worn footprints of the past and have a
gray clergymans ghost for our daily and nightly inmate yet all
these outward circumstances are made less than visionary by the
renewing power of the spirit  Should the spirit ever lose this
powershould the withered leaves and the rotten branches and the
mosscovered house and the ghost of the gray past ever become its
realities and the verdure and the freshness merely its faint
dreamthen let it pray to be released from earth  It will need
the air of heaven to revive its pristine energies

What an unlookedfor flight was this from our shadowy avenue of
blackash and balm of Gilead trees into the infinite  Now we have
our feet again upon the turf  Nowhere does the grass spring up so
industriously as in this homely yard along the base of the stone
wall and in the sheltered nooks of the buildings and especially
around the southern doorstepa locality which seems particularly
favorable to its growth for it is already tall enough to bend over
and wave in the wind  I observe that several weedsand most
frequently a plant that stains the fingers with its yellow juicehave
survived and retained their freshness and sap throughout the
winter  One knows not how they have deserved such an exception from
the common lot of their race  They are now the patriarchs of the
departed year and may preach mortality to the present generation of
flowers and weeds

Among the delights of spring how is it possible to forget the
birds  Even the crows were welcome as the sable harbingers of a
brighter and livelier race  They visited us before the snow was
off but seem mostly to have betaken themselves to remote depths of
the woods which they haunt all summer long  Many a time shall I
disturb them there and feel as if I had intruded among a company of
silent worshippers as they sit in Sabbath stillness among the
treetops  Their voices when they speak are in admirable accordance
with the tranquil solitude of a summer afternoon and resounding so
far above the head their loud clamor increases the religious quiet
of the scene instead of breaking it  A crow however has no real
pretensions to religion in spite of his gravity of mien and black
attire he is certainly a thief and probably an infidel  The gulls
are far more respectable in a moral point of view  These denizens
of seabeaten rocks and haunters of the lonely beach come up our
inland river at this season and soar high overhead flapping their
broad wings in the upper sunshine  They are among the most
picturesque of birds because they so float and rest upon the air as
to become almost stationary parts of the landscape  The imagination
has time to grow acquainted with them they have not flitted away in
a moment  You go up among the clouds and greet these loftyflighted
gulls and repose confidently with them upon the sustaining
atmosphere  Ducks have their haunts along the solitary places of
the river and alight in flocks upon the broad bosom of the
overflowed meadows  Their flight is too rapid and determined for
the eye to catch enjoyment from it although it never fails to stir
up the heart with the sportsmans ineradicable instinct  They have
now gone farther northward but will visit us again in autumn

The smaller birdsthe little songsters of the woods and those
that haunt mans dwellings and claim human friendship by building
their nests under the sheltering eaves or among the orchard treesthese
require a touch more delicate and a gentler heart than mine to
do them justice  Their outburst of melody is like a brook let loose
from wintry chains  We need not deem it a too high and solemn word
to call it a hymn of praise to the Creator since Nature who
pictures the reviving year in so many sights of beauty has
expressed the sentiment of renewed life in no other sound save the
notes of these blessed birds  Their music however just now seems
to be incidental and not the result of a set purpose  They are
discussing the economy of life and love and the site and
architecture of their summer residences and have no time to sit on
a twig and pour forth solemn hymns or overtures operas
symphonies and waltzes  Anxious questions are asked grave
subjects are settled in quick and animated debate and only by
occasional accident as from pure ecstasy does a rich warble roll
its tiny waves of golden sound through the atmosphere  Their little
bodies are as busy as their voices they are all a constant flutter
and restlessness  Even when two or three retreat to a treetop to
hold council they wag their tails and heads all the time with the
irrepressible activity of their nature which perhaps renders their
brief span of life in reality as long as the patriarchal age of
sluggish man  The blackbirds three species of which consort
together are the noisiest of all our feathered citizens  Great
companies of themmore than the famous fourandtwenty whom
Mother Goose has immortalizedcongregate in contiguous treetops and
vociferate with all the clamor and confusion of a turbulent
political meeting  Politics certainly must be the occasion of
such tumultuous debates but still unlike all other politicians
they instil melody into their individual utterances and produce
harmony as a general effect  Of all bird voices none are more
sweet and cheerful to my ear than those of swallows in the dim
sunstreaked interior of a lofty barn they address the heart with
even a closer sympathy than robinredbreast  But indeed all these
winged people that dwell in the vicinity of homesteads seem to
partake of human nature and possess the germ if not the
development of immortal souls  We hear them saying their melodious
prayers at mornings blush and eventide  A little while ago in the
deep of night there came the lively thrill of a birds note from a
neighboring treea real song such as greets the purple dawn or
mingles with the yellow sunshine  What could the little bird mean
by pouring it forth at midnight Probably the music gushed out of
the midst of a dream in which he fancied himself in paradise with
his mate but suddenly awoke on a cold leafless bough with a New
England mist penetrating through his feathers  That was a sad
exchange of imagination for reality

Insects are among the earliest births of sprung  Multitudes of I
know not what species appeared long ago on the surface of the snow
Clouds of them almost too minute for sight hover in a beam of
sunshine and vanish as if annihilated when they pass into the
shade  A mosquito has already been heard to sound the small horror
of his buglehorn  Wasps infest the sunny windows of the house  A
bee entered one of the chambers with a prophecy of flowers  Rare
butterflies came before the snow was off flaunting in the chill
breeze and looking forlorn and all astray in spite of the
magnificence of their dark velvet cloaks with golden borders

The fields and woodpaths have as yet few charms to entice the
wanderer  In a walk the other day I found no violets nor
anemones nor anything in the likeness of a flower  It was worth
while however to ascend our opposite hill for the sake of gaining
a general idea of the advance of spring which I had hitherto been
studying in its minute developments  The river lay around me in a
semicircle overflowing all the meadows which give it its Indian
name and offering a noble breadth to sparkle in the sunbeams
Along the hither shore a row of trees stood up to their knees in
water and afar off on the surface of the stream tufts of bushes
thrust up their heads as it were to breathe The most striking
objects were great solitary trees here and there with a milewide
waste of water all around them  The curtailment of the trunk by
its immersion in the river quite destroys the fair proportions of
the tree and thus makes us sensible of a regularity and propriety
in the usual forms of nature  The flood of the present
seasonthough it never amounts to a freshet on our quiet streamhas
encroached farther upon the land than any previous one for at least
a score of years  It has overflowed stone fences and even rendered
a portion of the highway navigable for boats

The waters however are now gradually subsiding islands become
annexed to the mainland and other islands emerge like new
creations from the watery waste  The scene supplies an admirable
image of the receding of the Nile except that there is no deposit
of black slime or of Noahs flood only that there is a freshness
and novelty in these recovered portions of the continent which give
the impression of a world just made rather than of one so polluted
that a deluge had been requisite to purify it  These upspringing
islands are the greenest spots in the landscape the first gleam of
sunlight suffices to cover them with verdure

Thank Providence for spring  The earthand man himself by
sympathy with his birthplace would be far other than we find them if
life toiled wearily onward without this periodical infusion of the
primal spirit  Will the world ever be so decayed that spring may
not renew its greenness  Can man be so dismally age stricken that
no faintest sunshine of his youth may revisit him once a year  It
is impossible  The moss on our timeworn mansion brightens into
beauty the good old pastor who once dwelt here renewed his prime
regained his boyhood in the genial breezes of his ninetieth spring
Alas for the worn and heavy soul if whether in youth or age it
have outlived its privilege of springtime sprightliness  From such
a soul the world must hope no reformation of its evil no sympathy
with the lofty faith and gallant struggles of those who contend in
its behalf  Summer works in the present and thinks not of the
future autumn is a rich conservative winter has utterly lost its
faith and clings tremulously to the remembrance of what has been
but spring with its outgushing life is the true type of the
movement

considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States  US laws alone swamp our small staff

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks online payments and credit card
donations  To donate please visit httppglaforgdonate


Section   General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone  For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support


Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included  Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility

     httpwwwgutenbergnet

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenbergtm
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks
