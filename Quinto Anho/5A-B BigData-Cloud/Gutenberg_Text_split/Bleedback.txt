               It was just a harmless though amazing
              kids toy that sold for less than a dollar
                Yet it plunged the entire nation into a
                  nightmare of mystery and chaos

The thing is over now but I cant see a Teddy bear or a set of blocks
in a department store window without shuddering Im thankful Im a
bachelor and have no children around to remind me of the utterly insane
nightmare that a childs toy plunged our country intothe millions of
people who died in agonythe total disruption and near dissolution of
our nation

And yet as the United States tottered on the verge of complete
chaos it was ironically another childs toy that saved us A
simple ordinary everyday toy for tots stopped the fever halted
the carnage that was tearing our flesh and eyes and viscera into
shreds With most the scientists in the world working for an emergency
solution they could come up with no better answer than a toy thatd
been around for generations before the Mystery iGun was even
conceived

Being a plainclothesman I have seen greed and impatience ruin many
individual lives If I could have guessed at the chain of events that
would stem from my first contact with the younger Baxter brother I
would have put a bullet through his head in cold blood and cheerfully
faced the gas chamber

Instead I took off my hat and followed him through the substantial old
house to a moderately large room in the rear where Id been told we
would find a body

Leo Baxter was a little guy about fivefoot six like me but with a
better build His size was important for a couple of reasons one
being that it was startling to say the least when he pointed to the
giant on the floor and said My brother

He caught my look and shrugged impatiently I know I know but this
is no time for Mutt and Jeff gags Calvin has been murdered Now get
with it Lieutenant If Calvin was his brother Leos agitation was
understandable but his voice had a flat note of practicality in it
that I didnt like

As I looked down at the sprawled length of the big man on the tiled
floor the Mutt and Jeff angle didnt fit at all David and Goliath
was a better bet This Goliath seemed also to have met his fate from a
hole in the forehead I say seemed because it developed that Calvin
Baxter was not yet quite dead

Theres no pulse or breath his brother said when I mentioned this
error in his assumption

Youre no doctor Now call that ambulance like I told you Jump I
said

He jumped I made a quick examination meanwhile and when Leo came
back from the phone I pointed See the blood Its still coming out

Corpses bleed dont they

Not in spurts I said The holes tiny but whatevers in there
touched an artery See that

He looked and seemed convinced The ambulance will be here Anything
else I should do

Yes Nothing Dont touch a thing in this room  or did you already

Just Calvin I heard him fall and when I came in he was on his face

Why did you ask for homicide when you called the police Or lets put
it this way What makes you think it wasnt an accident

Two reasons First because I couldnt see any cause of the accident
When I turned him over the floor was smooth and clean under his
forehead except for the smear of blood Reason number two Because
Calvin just doesnt have accidents All his life hes moved in slow
motion Ive never known him to stumble or cut himself or drop
anything or even bump into anyone

I was checking around the room myself and I had to admit that both
reasons might be valid A man the size of Calvin wasnt likely to be
the skittish type And by the time the ambulance arrived I was ready to
admit that if the injury were an accident Calvin Baxter had contrived
to conceal its source

It took several of us to load the unconscious man onto the stretcher I
told his cocky little brother to stay on ice while I rode downtown in
the ambulance

Dr Thorsen called me into the emergency ward How did this happen
he wanted to know Thorsen is a lean learned old chap who normally
gives more answers than he asks

I said Dont know Doc I found him in a sort of home workshop No
power tools nothing dangerous in sight The bench at one end had a
couple of little gadgets on itlooked sort of electrical Some wire
soldering iron books a few rough circuit drawings

The gadgets What did they look like

I thought back and realized that what I had to describe would sound a
little peculiar Sort of like flashlights with a pistol grip  and
no lens where the light should come out Just blunt flat ends

Thorsen shrugged Then I dont know I expected you to report some
kind of a blast or explosion

No sign of one

All right then what else but a flying particle could drill a hole in
a mans forehead the diameter of a piece of gauge wire

What do the xrays show

Well know in a minute What about the murderattempt angle

I said that I had nothing to go on yet That was the whole truth and
the final truth

When Docs xrays revealed nothing but a blood clot deep in the brain
at the end of the tiny tunnel piercing the skull I was left without
even a modus operandi let alone a substantial suspect

                                   

For two days I investigated brother Leo and when I wasnt
investigating him I was questioning him The small town in Minnesota
where he claimed he and his brother were born had been the county seat
and the whole shivaree had burned up in a prairie fire years ago
courthouse birth records and all With no other living relatives
I had to depend on people who had known both men From those whom I
questioned I ascertained that they had been passing for brothers at
least for some time

On the third day Leos patience began to crack You keep asking me
the same stupid questions over and over I tell you Im a mechanical
engineer My brother was a mathematician Were both single I make
enough money in the construction game to support both of us Whats so
suspicious about humoring my brothers research

Among other things I said is your ignorance of what he was doing

For the fiftieth time I tell you I didnt know His exasperation
was mounting to the pitch I had been awaiting

You used the past tense You do know now

He wheeled and crossed the living room poured himself a drink of
straight bourbon and downed it Yes I have a notion now but its
none of your damned business His ideas may be patentable

I said slowly and quietly Now Ill tell you what Ive been waiting
for Ive been waiting for you to offer me information about the two
little gadgets that you removed from your brothers workbenchagainst
my explicit orders not to touch anything Until you produce those items
and explain your actions Ill be around here asking stupid questions
From now on understand

Damn cops He threw the shot glass to the floor and glared at me for
a long minute All right come with me

We went into a little library He took two volumes from a high shelf
and from the recess snatched the two gadgets with the pistol grips

From a table drawer which he unlocked with a key from his pocket he
took some drawings that looked like the ones that had disappeared from
his brothers little workshop

Calvin developed a new effect by applying one of his esoteric
mathematical symbols to a simple electronic circuit Leo began in
his surly tone He pointed at the margin of the circuit drawing There
were jottings of algebraic formulae in which the quantity i appeared
prominently He pointed this out to me and continued Being a cop you
wouldnt understand but this symbol stands for an imaginary number
the square root of a minus one

This rang a bell from away back in my own college math I said Yeah
I think I remember Its some sort of operational factor in polar
coordinates No real meaning in itself but

Well An educated cop Thats right except that Calvin managed to
give this symbol an actual functional application I was telling
the truth when I said I didnt know what he was doing I still dont
understand it and Ive been losing sleep over these formulae

Then why not take it to the university and let the professors

Because he interrupted whether I understand it or not Calvins
gadget happens to work Watch this

He picked an ordinary paper clip from the debris of pencils stamps and
rubber bands from the top desk drawers touched it to the muzzle end
of the gadget where it stuck as if magnetized Now keep your eyes on
the paper clip he ordered

His forefinger pressed a button in the pistol grip and without click
snap buzz or murmur the paper clip disappeared

Leo stared at me as thoughts of hyperspace fourthdimension and
spacewarps flitted through my mind It wasnt a Buck Rogers atomic
disintegrator because there was no heat flash or sound The clip was
suddenly elsewhere

And I suppose the other gadget brings it back I said

Thats what I thought but I cant make it work I suppose my brother
could if he were here

He tossed the thing to me pointed at the little box of paper clips in
the drawer and said Have fun

I did for about five minutes Eight paper clips later I was convinced
that whatever else it might be the gadget was no potential murder
weapon The clips disappeared totally You could pass your hand
through the point of departure without a tingle of sensation

Leo briefed me further The thing worked only on metallic conductors
It was harmless to human flesh and other organic matter Then he
removed the cover that ran the length of the rather crude handcarved
wooden barrel From front to back were One penlight cell a
lumpylooking coil of wire handwound on a spindleshaped iron core
and a short cylindrical barmagnet

In mass production he said About  cents worth of material and
maybe  cents worth of labor Do you see why I wanted to keep it a
secret until I could patent it

No I said flatly Unless you consider a paperclip disposal unit an
item of commercial importance

But its a whole new scientific principlethe rotation of matter
completely out of our spacetime continuum

That much I grasp but what good is it except as a demonstration of a
piece of pure scientific research

Good Lord man have you no imagination

Okay okay Get rich I said and slammed the front door behind me as
I stomped out I had been so certain that the missing gadgets would
give me a motive for the attack on Leos brother or at least the
method of inflicting the fantastic wound that I was about ready to
turn in my badge in frustration All I could pin on Leo was a desire to
cash in on his brothers gimmickwhich presumably he could have done
whether Calvin lived or died

Suppose I mused on my way back to the station that Calvin had refused
to let Leo commercialize on his discovery Perhaps Calvin was preparing
a paper for publication in scientific circles Maybe coolheaded little
Leo tried to knock off his brother to keep the secret in the family
until it could be turned to a selfish dollar

All right suppose a jury would accept such an impalpable theory as a
motive then what No murder weapon No witnesses Not even a genuine
murder yet because Calvin was still alive

Yes old Doc Thorsen had kept the mathematician alive somehow The
elder Baxter lay on his back across two white iron beds pushed
together in the City Hospital and Thorsen came in to report to me

The clot seems to be absorbing better than I expected but its
doubtful that we could operate to remove the paralyzing pressure The
puncture is deep into the brain tissue and hes too nearly gone to
survive such an ordeal

Any chance that he might recover consciousness

Pretty remote Thorsen told me Well keep a special nurse with him
as you ordered just in case he does

I left Calvin Baxter pale and motionless as some great statue supine
amid the tangle of plasma glucose and saline hoses under his
transparent oxygen tent The wound that had laid him low was no more
than a dot of dried blood on his massive forehead

Until his death his file would remain under unsolved crimes In my
own mind I was no longer sure of anything except that if there was a
nickel in Calvin Baxters discovery his mercenary brother would wring
it out

And he did Even before Calvin died

Some seven weeks later Leo marketed the MYSTERY iGUN as a combined
toy trick and puzzle and it set the whole damned world on its ear

I located Leo Baxter in his new suite of offices on the th floor
of the State Building He peeled back his lips in a sneery grin I
thought youd be showing up

He waved away his male secretary who was still clinging to my arm
trying to tow me back to the reception room I said I kept your
secret then you pull an irresponsible thing like this A kids toy
Good Lord man that device might be dangerous

I appreciate your professional ethics Lieutenant Ive applied for a
patent so you can tell all your friends now And stop worrying The
Mystery iGun is quite harmless I experimented a week before going
into production

A week I could scarcely believe my ears What happens when some kid
jams his gun against a lightpole or an automobile  or the night
lock on the First National Bank

Nothing It punches no holes A large metallic object simply
dissipates the field The largest object it will handle is about a
halfinch steel screw

Baxter your brothers accident is connected to that deviceand you
turn it loose as a novelty

Nonsense Its safe as a knothole It simply makes things disappear
Little things like tacks ball bearing old rusty nuts and bolts

And dimes and mammas earrings and the front door key I snapped
back Until you know how to bring those things back you had no right
to market that rig

He laid his small hands before him on the desk Lieutenant Im sick
of working for other people This is my chance to get a bankroll to
back my own contracting firm Yes I financed Calvins research because
hes brilliant and I knew hed come up with something some day Now
hes done it and Im merely protecting his interests and my investment
in him See here He shoved some documents at me There was the patent
application a declaration of partnership for purposes of marketing
the Mystery iGun and the articles of incorporation of the Baxter
Construction Company

Okay I said So youve cut your brother in on all this Whos his
beneficiary when he dies

Still looking for a motive for murder arent you Lieutenant

I didnt admit it to him but he was right Calvins accident seemed
too convenient to the purposes of his practical little brother
Leo Whats more the lab and medical men on the force were just
as mystified today as they were when we brought Calvin in with the
needlethin hole in his skull Old Doc Thorsen had admitted to me that
he could name no implementnot even a surgical instrumentthat could
have inflicted such a narrow gauge hole It had to be caused by a
fragment but there was no fragment in the brain

Leo I said I know you consider this case closed but I want you to
do me a favor I want to go over your brothers lab once more

But youve He stopped shrugged and nodded his head Okay Im
interested in finding out what hurt Cal as much as you are Ill tell
you Im busy the rest of this week but Ill meet you at the old house
next Monday evening at eight You see I closed up the place and moved
downtown

I agreed with the feeling that he was deliberately making me wait just
to annoy me Leo Baxter was an important man now a man graciously
willing to cooperate with the policeat his own convenience I stood
up Your brother has been calling your name I suppose they told you
that

They phoned Doctor said it was just mutterings

You havent even been to see him

Whats the use He wouldnt recognize me

Well it wasnt any of my business really but its funny how you get
to hate a man for his attitude I dont know what I expected to find
by going over that labworkshop again but whatever it was I hoped it
would incriminate Leo On the face of it he was guilty of nothing more
than a premature marketing of a new device but the way he was cashing
in on Calvins genius certainly did the dying man no honor

Cash in was right The toys sold like bubblegum The papers radio
and TV picked up the sensational gimmick and gave it a billion bucks
worth of free advertising And the profitable part of it was that the
iGun was so simple to massproduce that Leos fifteen contracting
manufacturers were almost able to keep up with the astronomical demand

Before that week was up the Wall Street Journal estimated there
were already more iGuns in the hands of the juvenile public than all
the yoyos ever produced They retailed at eightyfive cents made of
plastic with a hole in the back where you could change the penlight
battery They sold all right They sold in drugstores and toy stores
and dime stores and department stores Toddlers tykes and teenagers
went for them And adults Maybe  million of them were in the hands
of the public before I saw Leo Baxter next

Which was almost two weeks instead of the one week he had promised

I finally got an appointment Sorry he said Ive been tied up with
government people all week The A E C tried to get me in trouble

I said Skip it You promised for tonight Now lets go

I cant possibly make it tonight He pointed at his desk It was
littered with correspondence orders and contracts Give me one more
week Lieutenant

It was an order not a request

There was nothing to do but wait the third week It was not however
uneventful It was the week the accidents began to happen

At  of a Tuesday afternoon a man was admitted to a local hospital
with a perforated belly Straight through hide guts and liver A
newsman got hold of it and wrote a scare story about an attack with a
pellet gun that must shoot needles

Before the edition was sold out the hospitals were loaded with
emergency cases People with holes in them Tiny little holes
mostly but holes that went right through them Then dogs Then
automobiles trucks and busses Holes in their radiators Holes in
windshields that always went straight back through seats and sometimes
passengersright out through the rear end

                                   

The city panicked Then the county state and nation In two days yes
the whole nation

At first everyone thought we were being attacked by some secret weapon
By some miracle of statesmanship the President of the United States
prevented a massive retaliation attack by the army upon our most
likely enemylong enough for Intelligence to affirm that no enemy on
Earth was that mad at us

Then all thoughts turned to extraterrestrial space A bombardment from
the sky It was ridiculous to even consider because none of the holes
that appeared in people and things came from above The holes were
almost entirely in the horizontal plane

Strangely enough during those first two days nobody thought of the
Mystery iGun No one but me

Leo Baxter had disappeared into thin air as completely as if hed
turned to metal and crawled into the muzzle of one of his own toys

I had every known place he frequented staked out with a pair of
plainclothesmen but it was the morning of the second day of
accidents before I got a radio call from the squad car stationed near
the old Baxter home

Leo had come home at last He was a sad looking midget when I got
there Obviously no sleep unshaven deep hollows under his eyes

I figured youd be waiting for me Lieutenant but you know what he
demanded I dont give a damn I kept waiting for them to figure out
the answer to these accidents and string me up How come you didnt
tell anybody

I said Shut up and lets go inside

Sure I figured the iGun was the cause but the last thing I wanted
was for Leo to get strung up before I laid my hands on that other
devicethe one that wouldnt work I wanted that rig and all the plans
and formulae and Leo undoubtedly had them hidden deeper than Fort Knox

He unlocked the door and I told the others to wait outside We went
into the hall and closed the door behind us So your little toy was
harmless I said grabbing him by his wrinkled lapels So it just
shoots stuff off into another dimension

He stared at me his eyes half glazed I dontknow Thats what the
notes said He sank into a chair I guess it doesnt though It must
ball up the metal object and shoot it outinfinite velocityreduced
in sizeinfinite massinfinite inertiakeeps circling the globe
likelike a satellite Goes right through anything it hits Goes on
and on Forever Little bullets Right through steel Right through
flesh and bones

Simmer down I said Youve been reading the papers Ive been
checking the facts

What do you mean

That you were right the first time It does shoot metal objects
into another dimension But they dont stay there They ooze back
Slowly Real slow so the first edge or corner that sticks back into
our dimension is only a few millionths of an inch thick Then a few
tenthousandths then a few thousandthsand thats about the time they
start making holes in people and objects that run into them

Run into them

Certainly There are no holes in buildings or other stationary
objects The holes are all horizontal Now look Baxter our only
chance is to work on that other device and your brothers notes and
maybe we can develop an extractor of some kind

No No you dont understand he said shaking his head like a
sleepwalker It balls up the metal Shoots it out Infinite mass
Infinite veloc

Knock off that nonsense and tell me where those plans are

Trying to steal my brothers other invention are you Its not
patented yet You know that dont you Couldnt patent it because I
cant make it work yet Youre smart but you wont get it from me

I had a fair hold on him but the pure insanity that flared in his
eyes shocked me for just the instant it took him to wrench out of
my hands He stumbled to the door of the study and burst through it
heading for the window I didnt hurry after him too fast because I
knew the boys outside would take him

Leo Baxter was only three paces into the stale air of the unused
library when he screamed clasping his hands to his chest and dropped
A peculiar grating plucking sound came faintly before he thudded to
the carpet

I stopped hard in my tracks and wiped the sweat from my face while Leo
Baxter twitched almost at my feet his heart shredded and bubbling its
last in his perforated chest

The paper clips The ones I had propelled into nothingness weeks ago

Hat in hand I advanced slowly waving it before me chest high Then
it caught suddenly grated for a split second and passed on in its
arc Now there were several tiny holes in it I backed away a foot and
brought my hat down slowly on the same lethal spot of air Chesthigh
it caught and hung suspended

Leaving it there as a marker I took off my suitcoat held it before me
and inched forward toward the desk Something plucked at the dangling
garment and a chill froze my spine Had I been walking forward
normally the tiny speck of metal that barely caught the glint of light
from the window would have pierced my skin at just about the site of
my appendix I circled the spot continuing to feel forward with my
coat That was the paper clip Baxter had fired to demonstrate to me
that first day

At the phone I called headquarters and told the chief what to do

Youre so right he told me his voice slurring strangely Only
youre a little late The order went out to confiscate the iGuns They
think the damned toys might have something to do with the accidents
And I bought one of the first ones for my little Jerry His voice
sounded hollow

So they were figuring it out The next question was how to extract the
deadly particles from the other dimension or how to keep them from
bleeding back slowly into ours

I moved cautiously through the old house fanning every inch of air
ahead of me with a phone book When I got to Calvin Baxters workshop
I was especially careful but I neednt have been The only metal
particles stuck into the thin air seemed to be over his workbench
where he had been experimenting with his device All but one

It was right where I expected to find itbetter than six feet in the
air just forehead high for a man tall as Calvin Baxter He had fired
his prototype of the iGun just once into the middle of the room

How long ago Eightten weeks ago

It seemed impossible that all this horror had occurred in such a short
time

But there it was stuck in space protruding about a hundredth of an
inch from nowhere into clear visibility So little was showing that I
couldnt be sure but it looked like the tip of an ordinary little nail
or woodscrew

This was my murderweapon the cause of Calvin Baxters accident
Hed run into it jerked his head back and the speck had come out the
same hole it went in

In twenty minutes by the clock I had the lab crew out from
headquarters and had explained the whole business to them First they
measured the length of the protrusion and my guess was about right It
measured  inches on the micrometer caliper

If it were a screw an inch long at that rate of bleedback it would
take another  weeks to come the rest of the way out Almost two years

Paul Riley the lab chief was sharp He caught it about the same time
I did and turned to look at me Weve got to figure a way of getting
those things out of the way

I nodded But quick

Collins our print man said Why not just shoot them back into
wherever it is they go with another iGun

And have them come bleeding back after a few weeks Paul frowned him
silent

He picked up a hammer from the bench and tapped the tiny glinting
speck The point flattened out a bit but the thud of the hammer
indicated how solidly it was stuck Then he walked around behind the
point and struck it a hard blow from the crosssection side The
hammer shivered in his hand and he dropped it rubbing his numbed
fingers with his other hand

Lieutenant he said slowly we are up against something

We found we could file away the metal easily enough Sure it filed away
until the file cut into empty space But cold comfort that was In a
few hours we knew molecule by molecule the screw buried in the other
dimension would come oozing back a minute but lethal speck ready to
ambush the first very tall man who walked toward it

Tall man

Thats why Leo Baxter and I had failed to find it in the first place
I had crisscrossed that room half a thousand times in my previous
examinations If I had been taller or the speck of metal lower

Weve got to bring Calvin Baxter back to consciousness somehow I
said Weve got to find out how that extractor of his works

Right Jerry said dropping his hands in resignation Wed run out of
ideas at the same time and the senior Baxter appeared to be our only
hope

                                   

We fanned our way out of there into the squad car and proceeded at a
gingerly five miles per hour back to headquarters On my insistence
Calvin Baxter had been set up in a private room at the jail with Doc
Thorsen in attendance The city hospitals were so jammed with accident
victims and frantic relatives that it was no place to work with a man
who was our only salvation

When I explained everything to Dr Thorsen and told him how important
it was that we bring Calvin back to consciousness he shook his head
It might be done but it would probably kill him

But you said hed never recover anyway I argued

Thorsen seemed to be considering that Yes he said at last Thats
more apparent now than ever Hes beginning to suffer the usual
complications of immobility Probably wont last more than a few weeks
anyway But cant you get the dope you want from his brother he
stalled while he weighed his ethics against the necessity of the moment

His brother I told him is dead Paper clips Right through the
heart

I see Well we could operate but as I said Calvin wouldnt survive
for long Maybe only hours or minutes And maybe not even long enough
to regain consciousness after we remove the clot

I said Ive left a crew at the Baxter house to tear it apart board
by board until we find this socalled extractor that Leo hid But
even after we find it we need Calvin to tell us how to make it work
There must be a part missing

We had wandered into Calvins room and were talking over his great
supine body covered to the chin with a white sheet The speck of scalp
on his forehead had dried up and dropped off leaving only a faint white
spot

As I mentioned the missing part his lips began moving and a grunt
issued from his throat Listen I said He hears me Hes trying to
talk

No Lieutenant Thorsen said putting a hand to his eyes Hes been
grunting like that for days The only word that ever comes out is his
brothers name Leo

The name struck anger and frustration in me Leo I halfshouted
That stinking littlenever even visited his brother

Relax Gene That wont do any good The mans dead he reminded me

Relax When all over the country people are tearing their bodies to
pieces Innocent people Little kids

I know I know I just spent nine hours in the emergency ward
Peritonitis Cardiac injury Lungs Torn eyeballs And its probably
just the beginning

Then what are you waiting for I demanded Our only chance is to
bring Calvin Baxter to consciousness long enough to explain how his
extractor works

Doc ran trembling hands through his fuzz of white hair For the first
time I noticed that the pupils of his eyes were moving back and forth
in little quick darting motions like a wild animal looking for
escape Idont know Gene I suppose you are right Onlywe need
permissionwe mustyou see he might die and

I took a good look at him and suddenly realized that despite his calm
voice the old man was going to pieces I grabbed him by the arm
and hauled him out of there across the hall to the chiefs office
Durstine had his head down on his arms slouched over the desk fast
asleep between two clanging telephones

Wake up chief I said shaking him by the shoulder We have to get
Baxter to City Hospital and

Durstine raised his head and stared at me His usually sharp gray eyes
were dull and his face looked dirty with a stubble of black whiskers
With a deliberate motion of both hands he knocked the receivers off
both phones and fell back in his swivel chair Now what he asked
thickly

Youre drunk I exclaimed Durstine who would fire a year man
without a qualm if he caught a single trace of beer on his breath on
duty

What else is new He could barely focus his eyes on me

I swallowed a couple of times and began explaining what must be done
Get the mayor and Civil Defense on the phone Commandeer all radio
stations to explain the true nature of the metallic particles to the
public Tell them to stay put and when they did move to walk slowly
fanning the air ahead of them with something solidan umbrella a
coat newspaper garbage can lidanything to warn them of the tiny
suspended daggers

Yeah Great idea Some people doing it already He said it without
enthusiasm Only trouble is the phones are swamped Communications
are breaking down already and when people learn about the fever they
will blow skyhigh

The fever

The fever He bobbed his head loosely My Jerry died of it this
afternoon Came down with it day before yesterday By the time we got
him to the hospital this morning he was running a hundred and five
Docs were too busy with bleeders Wouldnt listen to me until it was
too late Jerrys dead My little Jerry His voice was flat his eyes
staring straight ahead

Jerry was his only son and one of the first kids in town to own an
iGun Durstine had said he bought it for himself The chief went on
Whats more the fevers epidemic Before we left the hospital they
were dragging victims in by the hundreds Not just kids either On top
of this other thing we got the worst epidemic in history No one knows
what it is

I looked at Thorsen You said youd been at the hospital What is it

Isaw a few cases He said it almost under his breath

I grabbed him by his coat lapels Snap out of it Doc If you know
what it is for Gods sake tell us

They dont know what it is he said looking down at the floor

But you do I can tell by your face

All right maybe I do His face was drawn and defiant with an almost
fanatical determination There arent enough sulphas and antibiotics
in the world to control it We cant do anything about it so why drive
people crazy with fear

Durstine was coming out of his fog He opened the big bottom drawer of
his desk and handed an open fifth of whiskey to Thorsen He said Doc
youre in no condition to make a decision like that

Thorsen tipped up the bottle and let several swallows pour down his
leathery neck The stuff brought tears to his eyes He blinked them
away and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand All right public
guardian Ill tell you Its pretty obvious and other medical men
will think of it pretty quick I supposewhen they find out the cause
of the punctures they are treating This fever is just more of the
same Peritonitis Only its caused by particles so small that you
cant even feel when they penetrate the skin Theyre large enough to
poke holes in your intestines though Large enough to make microscopic
passages for bacteria So you see for every bleeding patient there
will be hundreds thousands coming down with peritonitisinfection of
the body cavity from within Without drugs the inflammation spreads in
hours and the temperature goes up and up Its fatal

I could almost feel the pain in my belly and the fire in my veins as he
spoke Doc Thorsen took another drink and handed me the bottle You
look a little pale Gene Have a jolt and see if your guts leak

Durstine and I both had a drink and the chief said I see what you
meant I wish youd kept your mouth shut

I said Dammit weve got to do something

Like what Durstine asked bitterly Like quarantining the schools
and the playgrounds

Thorsen nodded grimly And the parks And all back yards and front
yards

Durstine picked it up again And empty lots and all sidewalks and
streets and public buildings and the whole damned outdoors plus the
indoors

The enormity of the problem began to sink into my tired brain In the
space of weeks more than  million iGuns were sold in the United
States alone Multiply that figure by the number of times each was
fired Ten Fifty A hundred times Only God knew how many billion
nails tacks screws and rivets were launched into limbo and were now
just beginning to returninvisible at firstto skewer the American
people

Wherever kids had playedand that was virtually everywheredeath was
hidden And the semivisible particles would keep emerging for weeks
in the order that they were shot into the other dimension Worse yet
at the slow rate of emergence it would be months or years before the
metallic flotsam returned completely and dropped to earth

A man could protect himself only by remaining motionless But society
was geared to motion fast spacecovering motion The nation would
starve to death if everyone didnt go insane first and tear themselves
to pieces running around

Weve got to get the secret of that extractor out of Calvin Baxter
I said If we can discover the principle we can build large models
like a vacuum cleaner

                                   

Getting Baxter into City Hospital and finding a competent surgeon in
good enough condition to perform the delicate operation took almost
twentyfour hours The hospital resembled an abattoir the corridor
floors slick from the drippings of fresh blood as people seeking help
wandered frantically from floor to floor

Somehow we managed to impress upon the staff the fact that Baxter had
priority and we were allowed on the operating floor which was guarded
at all entries

Sick with exhaustion I waited with Durstine Thorsen was impressed
into duty immediately and that was the last we saw of him It was a
good many hours before they called us into the operating room I wont
try to describe the sight in detail Surgeons and nurses hovered over
tables weaving like drunken butchers in bloodsoaked aprons In one
corner on a cot Baxter lay with his head and shoulders propped up
high His feet hung over the end at least fourteen inches A single
sheet covered him

The top of his skull was bandaged and he looked even paler than
before A doctor and one nurse stood on either side of him As we came
in the doctor said Ive been told of the problem Weve done all we
can but this man is dying I think we can bring him to consciousness
for a few minutes Its a terribly cruel thing to do and Im not sure
he will be coherent Are you sure you want me to try

Its his invention that brought on all of this I said If theres
any solution to it he has it in his head

Very well

He did things with a hypodermic needle while the nurse rigged an oxygen
tent The smell of ether and blood made me sicker My throat was dry
and I remember wishing I hadnt drunk Durstines whiskey As we stood
waiting the humid air felt almost unbearably hot and I had difficulty
focussing my eyes

Durstine looked terrible holloweyed unshaven but he seemed in
better shape than I It was he who caught the first flicker of Baxters
eyes and dropped to his knees The color came back to the scientists
face in a rush of pink and his chest heaved with deep breathing

Can you hear me Durstine began

                                   

An hour later Baxter was dead as predicted And so was all hope of
removing the lethal debris with his other invention The extractor
didnt work he had told us Yes hed been trying to reverse the field
to retrieve the metallic objects from the other dimension but the
experiment was a failure

Durstine took my arm Come on Gene Weve done all we can I know one
safe placea place where no kids ever played

Yeah I know I said with a tongue two sizes too big The nearest
bar The damned kids Theyve murdered us Leo Baxter and the damned
kids

Things were turning gray but I remember the chief catching me by the
shoulder and jerking me around Too late I remembered about his little
Jerry and the agony my words must have carved in his heart I wished
hed slug me but he didnt He looked at me for a long minute and
said something I dont remember because the fog closed ina hot dry
fog that swept into my brain and blacked out the light I dont even
remember falling

The last thought I had was the fever Ive got it And Thorsen said
there were no more antibiotics or drugs left in the city

                                   

Some weeks later it was a surprise but no pleasure to discover I was
still alive Through the smoke of my unfocussed eyes I could tell that
my private room was occupied by at least a dozen other patients Some
were on cots and some like me simply lay on the floor with a blanket
over them

I had one second visit from the doctor before Durstine came to take
me away The doc said simply Youre a lucky man Lieutenant We
didnt save many fever patients after the drugs ran out

The chief brought a couple of boys in blue with a stretcher to haul me
out I was amazed to discover that automobiles were still moving about
the streetsnot many but a few I was too sick and exhausted to talk
during the ride

Durstine rode in back with me a hand on my shoulder Dont worry
Gene he said Youre going to be all right And weve got this thing
pretty well licked

He looked into my eyes and read the question I was too weak to speak
aloud

No he said we didnt figure out Baxters extractor But we do have
a successful detector and all we have to do now is use itthen hang a
tin can or an old ketchup bottle on each speck of metal for a marker
Yeah the countrys going to be cluttered up like a hanging garbage
dump for a long time but if you can see em you can dodge em

A detector Why theyd have to equip every person in the country
with one And surely nothing less than an electronic radartype
gadget could detect the microscopic particles as they first began to
emergethe kind that had riddled my intestines and given me the fever
without even leaving a mark on my skin

I know what you are thinking Durstine said His face was gray and
drawn but he wore a faint smile It was simple when somebody thought
of it What would be cheap enough to distribute universally yet
effective enough to give you positive warning You see these tiny
particles are so fine at first that you can fan the air with a plank
and never know when one passes through

He raised me up from the stretcher and let me look out the window of
the police ambulance Through squinted eyes I made out a strange
sight A thin scattering of pedestrians was moving slowly on the
sidewalks winding their ways among a random collection of floating tin
cans and inverted bottles

When we stopped for a red light I watched a young woman in a business
suit step between a whiskey bottle headhigh and a bean can about
kneehigh and then proceed gingerly waving a colored sphere ahead
of her This sphere about eighteen inches in diameter suddenly
disappeared She stopped abruptly and began shouting Before the
traffic light turned green a man came up with an empty motor oil can
and placed it on the sidewalk under the point she indicated in the air
before her

Durstine explained When that speck gets large enough to support it
that can will be hung on it Meanwhile other people are forewarned
that the air over the can is outofbounds so they wont waste
detectors on it

As he spoke the young woman was fishing another detector from her
purse It was a limp bit of something which she placed to her lips and
inflated until it was a footandahalf in diameter then she tied off
the neck and proceeded down the walk waving it before her in great
vertical sweeps

It was as simple as that

Our undoing had been an cent kids toy And our salvation was a
pennyballoon
