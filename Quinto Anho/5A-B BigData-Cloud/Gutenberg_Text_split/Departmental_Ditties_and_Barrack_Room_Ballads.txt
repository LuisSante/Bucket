DEPARTMENTAL DITTIES

  I have eaten your bread and salt
     I have drunk your water and wine
  The deaths ye died I have watched beside
     And the lives that ye led were mine

  Was there aught that I did not share
     In vigil or toil or ease
  One joy or woe that I did not know
     Dear hearts across the seas

  I have written the tale of our life
     For a sheltered peoples mirth
  In jesting guisebut ye are wise
  And ye know what the jest is worth




GENERAL SUMMARY

  We are very slightly changed
  From the semiapes who ranged
     Indias prehistoric clay
  Whoso drew the longest bow
  Ran his brother down you know
     As we run men down today

  Dowb the first of all his race
  Met the Mammoth face to face
     On the lake or in the cave
  Stole the steadiest canoe
  Ate the quarry others slew
     Diedand took the finest grave

  When they scratched the reindeerbone
  Someone made the sketch his own
     Filched it from the artistthen
  Even in those early days
  Won a simple Viceroys praise
     Through the toil of other men

  Ere they hewed the Sphinxs visage
  Favoritism governed kissage
  Even as it does in this age

  Who shall doubt the secret hid
  Under Cheops pyramid
  Was that the contractor did
     Cheops out of several millions
  Or that Josephs sudden rise
  To Comptroller of Supplies
  Was a fraud of monstrous size
     On King Pharoahs swart Civilians

  Thus the artless songs I sing
  Do not deal with anything
     New or never said before

  As it was in the beginning
  Is today official sinning
     And shall be forevermore




ARMY HEADQUARTERS

  Old is the song that I sing
     Old as my unpaid bills
  Old as the chicken that kitmutgars bring
  Men at dakbungalowsold as the Hills

  Ahasuerus Jenkins of the Operatic Own
   Was dowered with a tenor voice of superSantley tone

  His views on equitation were perhaps a trifle queer
  He had no seat worth mentioning but oh he had an ear

  He clubbed his wretched company a dozen times a day
  He used to quit his charger in a parabolic way
  His method of saluting was the joy of all beholders
  But Ahasuerus Jenkins had a head upon his shoulders

  He took two months to Simla when the year was at the spring
  And underneath the deodars eternally did sing

  He warbled like a bulbul but particularly at
  Cornelia Agrippina who was musical and fat

  She controlled a humble husband who in turn controlled a Dept
  Where Cornelia Agrippinas human singingbirds were kept
  From April to October on a plump retaining fee
  Supplied of course per mensem by the Indian Treasury

  Cornelia used to sing with him and Jenkins used to play
  He praised unblushingly her notes for he was false as they
  So when the winds of April turned the budding roses brown
  Cornelia told her husband Tom you mustnt send him down

  They haled him from his regiment which didnt much regret him
  They found for him an officestool and on that stool they set him
  To play with maps and catalogues three idle hours a day
  And draw his plump retaining feewhich means his double pay

  Now ever after dinner when the coffeecups are brought
  Ahasuerus waileth oer the grand pianoforte
  And thanks to fair Cornelia his fame hath waxen great
  And Ahasuerus Jenkins is a power in the State




STUDY OF AN ELEVATION IN INDIAN INK

  This ditty is a string of lies
  Buthow the deuce did Gubbins rise

  POTIPHAR GUBBINS C E
  Stands at the top of the tree
  And I muse in my bed on the reasons that led
  To the hoisting of Potiphar G

  Potiphar Gubbins C E
  Is seven years junior to Me
  Each bridge that he makes he either buckles or breaks
  And his work is as rough as he

  Potiphar Gubbins C E
  Is coarse as a chimpanzee
  And I cant understand why you gave him your hand
  Lovely Mehitabel Lee

  Potiphar Gubbins C E
  Is dear to the Powers that Be
  For They bow and They smile in an affable style
  Which is seldom accorded to Me

  Potiphar Gubbins C E
  Is certain as certain can be
  Of a highlypaid post which is claimed by a host
  Of seniorsincluding Me

  Careless and lazy is he
  Greatly inferior to Me

  What is the spell that you manage so well
  Commonplace Potiphar G

  Lovely Mehitabel Lee
  Let me inquire of thee
  Should I have riz to what Potiphar is
  Hadst thou been mated to me




  A LEGEND

  This is the reason why Rustum Beg
  Rajah of Kolazai
  Drinketh the simpkin and brandy peg
  Maketh the money to fly
  Vexeth a Government tender and kind
  Alsobut this is a detailblind

  RUSTUM BEG of Kolazaislightly backward native state
  Lusted for a C S Iso began to sanitate
  Built a Jail and Hospitalnearly built a City drain
  Till his faithful subjects all thought their Ruler was insane

  Strange departures made he thenyea Departments stranger still
  Half a dozen Englishmen helped the Rajah with a will
  Talked of noble aims and high hinted of a future fine
  For the state of Kolazai on a strictly Western line

  Rajah Rustum held his peace lowered octroi dues a half
  Organized a State Police purified the Civil Staff
  Settled cess and tax afresh in a very liberal way
  Cut temptations of the fleshalso cut the Bukhshis pay

  Roused his Secretariat to a fine Mahratta fury
  By a Hookum hinting at supervision of dasturi
  Turned the State of Kolazai very nearly upsidedown
  When the end of May was nigh waited his achievement crown

  When the Birthday Honors came
  Sad to state and sad to see
  Stood against the Rajahs name nothing more than C I E
              

  Things were lively for a week in the State of Kolazai
  Even now the people speak of that time regretfully

  How he disendowed the Jailstopped at once the City drain
  Turned to beauty fair and frailgot his senses back again
  Doubled taxes cesses all cleared away each newbuilt thana
  Turned the twolakh Hospital into a superb Zenana

  Heaped upon the Bukhshi Sahib wealth and honors manifold
  Clad himself in Eastern garbsqueezed his people as of old

  Happy happy Kolazai  Never more  will Rustum Beg
  Play to catch the Viceroys eye He prefers the simpkin peg




THE STORY OF URIAH

  Now there were two men in one city
  the one rich and the other poor

  Jack Barrett went to Quetta
     Because they told him to
  He left his wife at Simla
     On threefourths his monthly screw
  Jack Barrett died at Quetta
     Ere the next months pay he drew

  Jack Barrett went to Quetta
     He didnt understand
  The reason of his transfer
     From the pleasant mountainland
  The season was September
     And it killed him out of hand

  Jack Barrett went to Quetta
     And there gave up the ghost
  Attempting two mens duty
     In that very healthy post
  And Mrs Barrett mourned for him
     Five lively months at most

  Jack Barretts bones at Quetta
     Enjoy profound repose
  But I shouldnt be astonished
     If now his spirit knows
  The reason of his transfer
     From the Himalayan snows

  And when the Last Great Bugle Call
     Adown the Hurnal throbs
  When the last grim joke is entered
     In the big black Book of Jobs
  And Quetta graveyards give again
     Their victims to the air
  I shouldnt like to be the man
     Who sent Jack Barrett there




THE POST THAT FITTED

      Though tangled and twisted the course of true love
              This ditty explains
      No tangles so tangled it cannot improve
              If the Lover has brains

  Ere the steamer bore him Eastward Sleary was engaged to marry
  An attractive girl at Tunbridge whom he called my little Carrie

  Slearys pay was very modest Sleary was the other way
  Who can cook a twoplate dinner on eight poor rupees a day

  Long he pondered oer the question in his scantly furnished quarters
  Then proposed to Minnie Boffkin eldest of Judge Boffkins daughters

  Certainly an impecunious Subaltern was not a catch
  But the Boffkins knew that Minnie mightnt make another match

  So they recognised the business and to feed and clothe the bride
  Got him made a Something Something somewhere on the Bombay side

  Anyhow the billet carried pay enough for him to marry
  As the artless Sleary put itJust the thing for me and Carrie

  Did he therefore jilt Miss Boffkinimpulse of a baser mind
  No He started epileptic fits of an appalling kind

  Of his modus operandi only this much I could gather
  Pearss shaving sticks will give you little taste and lots of lather

  Frequently in public places his affliction used to smite
  Sleary with distressing vigouralways in the Boffkins sight

  Ere a week was over Minnie weepingly returned his ring
  Told him his unhappy weakness stopped all thought of marrying

  Sleary bore the information with a chastened holy joy
  Epileptic fits dont matter in Political employ
  Wired three short words to Carrietook his ticket packed his kit
  Bade farewell to Minnie Boffkin in one last long lingering fit

  Four weeks later Carrie Sleary readand laughed until she wept
  Mrs Boffkins warning letter on the wretched epilept

  Year by year in pious patience vengeful Mrs Boffkin sits
  Waiting for the Sleary babies to develop Slearys fits




PUBLIC WASTE

    Walpole talks of a man and his price
           List to a ditty queer
    The sale of a DeputyActingVice
          ResidentEngineer
    Bought like a bullock hoof and hide
    By the Little Tin Gods on the Mountain Side

  By the Laws of the Family Circle tis written in letters of brass
  That only a Colonel from Chatham can manage the Railways of State
  Because of the gold on his breeks and the subjects wherein he must pass
  Because in all matters that deal not with Railways his knowledge is great

  Now Exeter Battleby Tring had laboured from boyhood to eld
  On the Lines of the East and the West and eke of the North and South
  Many Lines had he built and surveyedimportant the posts which he held
  And the Lords of the Iron Horse were dumb when he opened his mouth

  Black as the raven his garb and his heresies jettier still
  Hinting that Railways required lifetimes of study and knowledge
  Never clanked sword by his sideVauban he knew not nor drill
  Nor was his name on the list of the men who had passed through the College

  Wherefore the Little Tin Gods harried their little tin souls
  Seeing he came not from Chatham jingled no spurs at his heels
  Knowing that nevertheless was he first on the Government rolls
  For the billet of Railway Instructor to Little Tin Gods on Wheels

  Letters not seldom they wrote him having the honour to state
   It would be better for all men if he were laid on the shelf
  Much would accrue to his bankbook an he consented to wait
  Until the Little Tin Gods built him a berth for himself

  Special well paid and exempt from the Law of the Fifty and Five
  Even to Ninety and Ninethese were the terms of the pact
  Thus did the Little Tin Gods long may Their Highnesses thrive
  Silence his mouth with rupees keeping their Circle intact

  Appointing a Colonel from Chatham who managed the Bhamo State Line
  The which was one mile and one furlonga guaranteed twentyinch gauge
  So Exeter Battleby Tring consented his claims to resign
  And died on four thousand a month in the ninetieth year of his age




DELILAH

  We have another viceroy nowthose days are dead and done
  Of Delilah Aberyswith and depraved Ulysses Gunne

  Delilah Aberyswith was a ladynot too young
  With a perfect taste in dresses and a badlybitted tongue
  With a thirst for information and a greater thirst for praise
  And a little house in Simla in the Prehistoric Days

  By reason of her marriage to a gentleman in power
  Delilah was acquainted with the gossip of the hour
  And many little secrets of the halfofficial kind
  Were whispered to Delilah and she bore them all in mind

  She patronized extensively a man Ulysses Gunne
  Whose mode of earning money was a low and shameful one
  He wrote for certain papers which as everybody knows
  Is worse than serving in a shop or scaring off the crows

  He praised her queenly beauty first and later on he hinted
  At the vastness of her intellect with compliment unstinted
  He went with her ariding and his love for her was such
  That he lent her all his horses andshe galled them very much

  One day THEY brewed a secret of a fine financial sort
  It related to Appointments to a Man and a Report
  Twas almost worth the keepingonly seven people knew it
  And Gunne rose up to seek the truth and patiently pursue it

  It was a Viceroys Secret butperhaps the wine was red
  Perhaps an Aged Councillor had lost his aged head
  Perhaps Delilahs eyes were brightDelilahs whispers sweet
  The Aged Member told her what twere treason to repeat

  Ulysses went ariding and they talked of love and flowers
  Ulysses went acalling and he called for several hours
  Ulysses went awaltzing and Delilah helped him dance
  Ulysses let the waltzes go and waited for his chance

  The summer sun was setting and the summer air was still
  The couple went awalking in the shade of Summer Hill
  The wasteful sunset faded out in Turkishgreen and gold
  Ulysses pleaded softly and that bad Delilah told

  Next morn a startled Empire learnt the allimportant news
  Next week the Aged Councillor was shaking in his shoes
  Next month I met Delilah and she did not show the least
  Hesitation in affirming that Ulysses was a beast
                           

  We have another Viceroy now those days are dead and done
  Of Delilah Aberyswith and most mean Ulysses Gunne




WHAT HAPPENED

  Hurree Chunder Mookerjee pride of Bow Bazaar
  Owner of a native press BarrishteratLar
   Waited on the Government with a claim to wear
  Sabres by the bucketful rifles by the pair

  Then the Indian Government winked a wicked wink
  Said to Chunder Mookerjee Stick to pen and ink
  They are safer implements but if you insist
  We will let you carry arms wheresoeer you list

  Hurree Chunder Mookerjee sought the gunsmith and
  Bought the tubes of Lancaster Ballard Dean and Bland
  Bought a shiny bowieknife bought a townmade sword
  Jingled like a carriagehorse when he went abroad

  But the Indian Government always keen to please
  Also gave permission to horrid men like these
  Yar Mahommed Yusufzai down to kill or steal
  Chimbu Singh from Bikaneer Tantia the Bhil

  Killar Khan the Marri chief Jowar Singh the Sikh
  Nubbee Baksh Punjabi Jat Abdul Huq Rafiq
  He was a Wahabi last little Boh Hlaoo
  Took advantage of the Acttook a Snider too

  They were unenlightened men Ballard knew them not
  They procured their swords and guns chiefly on the spot
  And the lore of centuries plus a hundred fights
  Made them slow to disregard one anothers rights

  With a unanimity dear to patriot hearts
  All those hairy gentlemen out of foreign parts
  Said The good old days are backlet us go to war
   Swaggered down the Grand Trunk Road into Bow Bazaar

  Nubbee Baksh Punjabi Jat found a hidebound flail
  Chimbu Singh from Bikaneer oiled his Tonk jezail
  Yar Mahommed Yusufzai spat and grinned with glee
  As he ground the butcherknife of the Khyberee

  Jowar Singh the Sikh procured sabre quoit and mace
  Abdul Huq Wahabi jerked his dagger from its place
  While amid the junglegrass danced and grinned and jabbered
  Little Boh Hlaoo and cleared his dahblade from the scabbard

  What became of Mookerjee Soothly who can say
  Yar Mahommed only grins in a nasty way
  Jowar Singh is reticent Chimbu Singh is mute
  But the belts of all of them simply bulge with loot

  What became of Ballards guns Afghans black and grubby
  Sell them for their silver weight to the men of Pubbi
  And the shiny bowieknife and the townmade sword are
  Hanging in a Marri camp just across the Border

  What became of Mookerjee Ask Mahommed Yar
  Prodding Sivas sacred bull down the Bow Bazaar
  Speak to placid Nubbee Bakshquestion land and sea
  Ask the Indian Congressmenonly dont ask me




PINK DOMINOES

  They are fools who kiss and tell
    Wisely has the poet sung
  Man may hold all sorts of posts
    If hell only hold his tongue

  Jenny and Me were engaged you see
    On the eve of the Fancy Ball
  So a kiss or two was nothing to you
    Or any one else at all

  Jenny would go in a domino
    Pretty and pink but warm
  While I attended clad in a splendid
    Austrian uniform

  Now we had arranged through notes exchanged
    Early that afternoon
  At Number Four to waltz no more
    But to sit in the dusk and spoon

  I wish you to see that Jenny and Me
    Had barely exchanged our troth
  So a kiss or two was strictly due
    By from and between us both

  When Three was over an eager lover
    I fled to the gloom outside
  And a Domino came out also
    Whom I took for my future bride

  That is to say in a casual way
    I slipped my arm around her
  With a kiss or two which is nothing to you
    And ready to kiss I found her

  She turned her head and the name she said
    Was certainly not my own
  But ere I could speak with a smothered shriek
    She fled and left me alone

  Then Jenny came and I saw with shame
    Shed doffed her domino
  And I had embraced an alien waist
    But I did not tell her so

  Next morn I knew that there were two
    Dominoes pink and one
  Had cloaked the spouse of Sir Julian House
    Our big Political gun

  Sir J was old and her hair was gold
    And her eye was a blue cerulean
  And the name she said when she turned her head
    Was not in the least like Julian




THE MAN WHO COULD WRITE

  Shunshun the Bowl That fatal facile drink
    Has ruined many geese who dipped their quills in t
  Bribe murder marry but steer clear of Ink
    Save when you write receipts for paidup bills in t

  There may be silver in the blueblackall
  I know of is the iron and the gall

  Boanerges Blitzen servant of the Queen
  Is a dismal failureis a Mighthavebeen
  In a luckless moment he discovered men
  Rise to high position through a ready pen
  Boanerges Blitzen argued thereforeI
  With the selfsame weapon can attain as high
   Only he did not possess when he made the trial
  Wicked wit of Clvn irony of Ll

  Men who spar with Government need to back their blows
  Something more than ordinary journalistic prose

  Never young Civilians prospects were so bright
  Till an Indian paper found that he could write
  Never young Civilians prospects were so dark
  When the wretched Blitzen wrote to make his mark
  Certainly he scored it bold and black and firm
  In that Indian papermade his seniors squirm
  Quoted office scandals wrote the tactless truth
  Was there ever known a more misguided youth
  When the Rag he wrote for praised his plucky game
  Boanerges Blitzen felt that this was Fame
  When the men he wrote of shook their heads and swore
  Boanerges Blitzen only wrote the more

  Posed as Young Ithuriel resolute and grim
  Till he found promotion didnt come to him
  Till he found that reprimands weekly were his lot
  And his many Districts curiously hot

  Till he found his furlough strangely hard to win
  Boanerges Blitzen didnt care to pin
  Then it seemed to dawn on him something wasnt right
  Boanerges Blitzen put it down to spite

  Languished in a District desolate and dry
  Watched the Local Government yearly pass him by
  Wondered where the hitch was called it most unfair
                                          

  That was seven years agoand he still is there




MUNICIPAL

          Why is my District deathrate low
             Said Binks of Hezabad
          Well drains and sewageoutfalls are
            My own peculiar fad

          I learnt a lesson once It ran
          Thus quoth that most veracious man

  It was an August evening and in snowy garments clad
  I paid a round of visits in the lines of Hezabad
  When presently my Waler saw and did not like at all
  A Commissariat elephant careering down the Mall

  I couldnt see the driver and across my mind it rushed
  That that Commissariat elephant had suddenly gone musth

  I didnt care to meet him and I couldnt well get down
  So I let the Waler have it and we headed for the town

  The buggy was a new one and praise Dykes it stood the strain
  Till the Waler jumped a bullock just above the City Drain
  And the next that I remember was a hurricane of squeals
  And the creature making toothpicks of my fivefoot patent wheels

  He seemed to want the owner so I fled distraught with fear
  To the Main Drain sewageoutfall while he snorted in my ear
  Reached the fourfoot drainhead safely and in darkness and despair
  Felt the brutes proboscis fingering my terrorstiffened hair

  Heard it trumpet on my shouldertried to crawl a little higher
  Found the Main Drain sewage outfall blocked some eight feet up with mire
  And for twenty reeking minutes Sir my very marrow froze
  While the trunk was feeling blindly for a purchase on my toes

  It missed me by a fraction but my hair was turning grey
  Before they called the drivers up and dragged the brute away

  Then I sought the City Elders and my words were very plain
  They flushed that fourfoot drainhead andit never choked again

  You may hold with surfacedrainage and the sunforgarbage cure
  Till youve been a periwinkle shrinking coyly up a sewer

  I believe in wellflushed culverts

                                    This is why the deathrates small
  And if you dont believe me get shikarred yourself Thats all




A CODE OF MORALS

           Lest you should think this story true
           I merely mention I
           Evolved it lately Tis a most
           Unmitigated misstatement

  Now Jones had left his newwed bride to keep his house in order
  And hied away to the Hurrum Hills above the Afghan border
  To sit on a rock with a heliograph but ere he left he taught
  His wife the working of the Code that sets the miles at naught

  And Love had made him very sage as Nature made her fair
  So Cupid and Apollo linked per heliograph the pair
  At dawn across the Hurrum Hills he flashed her counsel wise
  At een the dying sunset bore her husbands homilies

  He warned her gainst seductive youths in scarlet clad and gold
  As much as gainst the blandishments paternal of the old
  But kept his gravest warnings for hereby the ditty hangs
  That snowyhaired Lothario LieutenantGeneral Bangs

  Twas General Bangs with Aide and Staff who tittupped on the way
  When they beheld a heliograph tempestuously at play
  They thought of Border risings and of stations sacked and burnt
  So stopped to take the message downand this is what they learnt

  Dash dot dot dot dot dash dot dash dot twice The General swore

  Was ever General Officer addressed as dear before
  My Love i faith My Duck Gadzooks My darling popsywop
  Spirit of great Lord Wolseley who is on that mountaintop

  The artless Aidedecamp was mute the gilded Staff were still
  As dumb with pentup mirth they booked that message from the hill
  For clear as summer lightningflare the husbands warning ran
  Dont dance or ride with General Bangsa most immoral man

  At dawn across the Hurrum Hills he flashed her counsel wise
  But howsoever Love be blind the world at large hath eyes
  With damnatory dot and dash he heliographed his wife
  Some interesting details of the Generals private life

  The artless Aidedecamp was mute the shining Staff were still
  And red and ever redder grew the Generals shaven gill

  And this is what he said at last his feelings matter not
  I think weve tapped a private line Hi Threes about there Trot

  All honour unto Bangs for neer did Jones thereafter know
  By word or act official who read off that helio

  But the tale is on the Frontier and from Michni to Mooltan
  They know the worthy General as that most immoral man




THE LAST DEPARTMENT

  Twelve hundred million men are spread
   About this Earth and I and You
  Wonder when You and I are dead
   What will those luckless millions do

  None whole or clean we cry or free from stain
  Of favour Wait awhile till we attain
    The Last Department where nor fraud nor fools
  Nor grade nor greed shall trouble us again

  Fear Favour or Affectionwhat are these
  To the grim Head who claims our services
    I never knew a wife or interest yet
  Delay that pukka step miscalled decease

  When leave long overdue none can deny
  When idleness of all Eternity
    Becomes our furlough and the marigold
  Our thriftless bullionminting Treasury

  Transferred to the Eternal Settlement
  Each in his strait woodscantled office pent
    No longer Brown reverses Smiths appeals
  Or Jones records his Minute of Dissent

  And One long since a pillar of the Court
  As mud between the beams thereof is wrought
    And One who wrote on phosphates for the crops
  Is subjectmatter of his own Report

  These be the glorious ends whereto we pass
  Let Him who Is go call on Him who Was
    And He shall see the mallie steals the slab
  For curriegrinder and for goats the grass

  A breath of wind a Border bullets flight
  A draught of water or a horses fright
    The droning of the fat Sheristadar
  Ceases the punkah stops and falls the night

  For you or Me Do those who live decline
  The step that offers or their work resign
    Trust me Todays Most Indispensables
  Five hundred men can take your place or mine

THE BALLAD OF FISHERS BOARDINGHOUSE

          That night when through the mooringchains
              The wideeyed corpse rolled free
            To blunder down by Garden Reach
              And rot at Kedgeree
            The tale the Hughli told the shoal
              The lean shoal told to me

  T was Fultah Fishers boardinghouse
    Where sailormen reside
  And there were men of all the ports
    From Mississip to Clyde
  And regally they spat and smoked
    And fearsomely they lied

  They lied about the purple Sea
    That gave them scanty bread
  They lied about the Earth beneath
    The Heavens overhead
  For they had looked too often on
    Black rum when that was red

  They told their tales of wreck and wrong
    Of shame and lust and fraud
  They backed their toughest statements with
    The Brimstone of the Lord
  And crackling oaths went to and fro
    Across the fistbanged board

  And there was Hans the blueeyed Dane
    Bullthroated bare of arm
  Who carried on his hairy chest
    The maid Ultrudas charm
  The little silver crucifix
    That keeps a man from harm

  And there was Jake WithouttheEars
    And Pamba the Malay
  And Carboy Gin the Guinea cook
    And Luz from Vigo Bay
  And Honest Jack who sold them slops
    And harvested their pay

  And there was Salem Hardieker
    A lean Bostonian he
  Russ German English Halfbreed Finn
    Yank Dane and Portuguee
  At Fultah Fishers boardinghouse
    They rested from the sea

  Now Anne of Austria shared their drinks
    Collinga knew her fame
  From Tarnau in Galicia
    To Juan Bazaar she came
  To eat the bread of infamy
    And take the wage of shame

  She held a dozen men to heel
    Rich spoil of war was hers
  In hose and gown and ring and chain
    From twenty mariners
  And by Port Law that week men called
    her Salem Hardiekers

  But seamen learntwhat landsmen know
    That neither gifts nor gain
  Can hold a winking Light o Love
    Or Fancys flight restrain
  When Anne of Austria rolled her eyes
    On Hans the blueeyed Dane

  Since Life is strife and strife means knife
    From Howrah to the Bay
  And he may die before the dawn
    Who liquored out the day
  In Fultah Fishers boardinghouse
    We woo while yet we may

  But cold was Hans the blueeyed Dane
    Bullthroated bare of arm
  And laughter shook the chest beneath
    The maid Ultrudas charm
  The little silver crucifix
    That keeps a man from harm

  You speak to Salem Hardieker
    You was his girl I know

  I ship mineselfs tomorrow see
    Und round the Skaw we go
  South down the Cattegat by Hjelm
    To Besser in Saro

  When love rejected turns to hate
    All ill betide the man

  You speak to Salem Hardieker
    She spoke as woman can
  A screama sobHe called menames
     And then the fray began

  An oath from Salem Hardieker
    A shriek upon the stairs
  A dance of shadows on the wall
    A knifethrust unawares
  And Hans came down as cattle drop
    Across the broken chairs
                                   

  In Anne of Austrias trembling hands
    The weary head fell low
  I ship mineselfs tomorrow straight
    For Besser in Saro
  Und there Ultruda comes to me
    At Easter und I go

  South down the CattegatWhats here
    Therearenolightsto guide
   The mutter ceased the spirit passed
    And Anne of Austria cried
  In Fultah Fishers boardinghouse
    When Hans the mighty died

  Thus slew they Hans the blueeyed Dane
    Bullthroated bare of arm
  But Anne of Austria looted first
    The maid Ultrudas charm
  The little silver crucifix
    That keeps a man from harm




AS THE BELL CLINKS

  As I left the Halls at Lumley rose the vision of a comely
  Maid last season worshipped dumbly watched with fervor from afar
  And I wondered idly blindly if the maid would greet me kindly

  That was allthe rest was settled by the clinking tongabar
  Yea my life and hers were coupled by the tonga couplingbar

  For my misty meditation at the second changinstation
  Suffered sudden dislocation fled before the tuneless jar
  Of a Wagner obbligato scherzo doublehand staccato
  Played on either ponys saddle by the clacking tongabar

  Played with human speech I fancied by the jigging jolting bar

  She was sweet thought I last season but twere surely wild unreason
  Such tiny hope to freeze on as was offered by my Star
  When she whispered something sadly Iwe feel your going badly
   And you let the chance escape you rapped the rattling tongabar

  What a chance and what an idiot clicked the vicious tongabar

  Heart of manoh heart of putty Had I gone by Kakahutti
  On the old Hillroad and rutty I had scaped that fatal car
  But his fortune each must bide by so I watched the milestones slide by
  To You call on Her tomorrowfugue with cymbals by the bar

  You must call on Her tomorrowposthorn gallop by the bar

  Yet a further stage my goal onwe were whirling down to Solon
  With a double lurch and roll on best foot foremost ganz und gar
  She was very sweet I hinted If a kiss had been imprinted
  Would ha saved a world of trouble clashed the busy tongabar

  Been accepted or rejected banged and clanged the tongabar

  Then a notion wild and daring spite the income taxs paring
  And a hasty thought of sharingless than many incomes are
  Made me put a question private you can guess what I would drive at
  You must work the sum to prove it clanked the careless tongabar

  Simple Rule of Two will prove it lilted back the tongabar

  It was under Khyraghaut I mused Suppose the maid be haughty
  There are lovers richand rottywait some wealthy Avatar
  Answer monitor untiring twixt the ponies twain perspiring
   Faint heart never won fair lady creaked the straining tongabar

  Can I tell you ere you ask Her pounded slow the tongabar

  Last the Tara Devi turning showed the lights of Simla burning
  Lit my little lazy yearning to a fiercer flame by far

  As below the Mall we jingled through my very heart it tingled
  Did the iterated order of the threshing tongabar

  Try your luckyou cant do better twanged the loosened tongabar




AN OLD SONG

  So long as neath the Kalka hills
    The tongahorn shall ring
  So long as down the Solon dip
    The hardheld ponies swing
  So long as Tara Devi sees
    The lights of Simla town
  So long as Pleasure calls us up
    Or Duty drives us down
      If you love me as I love you
      What pair so happy as we two

  So long as Aces take the King
    Or backers take the bet
  So long as debt leads men to wed
    Or marriage leads to debt
  So long as little luncheons Love
    And scandal hold their vogue
  While there is sport at Annandale
    Or whisky at Jutogh
      If you love me as I love you
      What knife can cut our love in two

  So long as down the rocking floor
    The raving polka spins
  So long as Kitchen Lancers spur
    The maddened violins
  So long as through the whirling smoke
    We hear the ofttold tale
  Twelve hundred in the Lotteries
     And Whatshername for sale
      If you love me as I love you
      Well play the game and win it too

  So long as Lust or Lucre tempt
    Straight riders from the course
  So long as with each drink we pour
    Black brewage of Remorse
  So long as those unloaded guns
    We keep beside the bed
  Blow off by obvious accident
    The lucky owners head
      If you love me as I love you
      What can Life kill or Death undo

  So long as Death twixt dance and dance
    Chills best and bravest blood
  And drops the reckless rider down
    The rotten rainsoaked khud
  So long as rumours from the North
    Make loving wives afraid
  So long as Burma takes the boy
    Or typhoid kills the maid
      If you love me as I love you
      What knife can cut our love in two

  By all that lights our daily life
    Or works our lifelong woe
  From Boileaugunge to Simla Downs
    And those grim glades below
  Where heedless of the flying hoof
    And clamour overhead
  Sleep with the grey langur for guard
    Our very scornful Dead
      If you love me as I love you
      All Earth is servant to us two

  By Docket Billetdoux and File
    By Mountain Cliff and Fir
  By Fan and Sword and Officebox
    By Corset Plume and Spur
  By Riot Revel Waltz and War
    By Women Work and Bills
  By all the life that fizzes in
    The everlasting Hills
      If you love me as I love you
      What pair so happy as we two




CERTAIN MAXIMS OF HAFIZ

     I
  If It be pleasant to look on stalled in the packed serai
  Does not the Young Man try Its temper and pace ere he buy
  If She be pleasant to look on what does the Young Man say
  Lo She is pleasant to look on give Her to me today

   II
  Yea though a Kafir die to him is remitted Jehannum
  If he borrowed in life from a native at sixty per cent per annum

   III
  Blister we not for bursati So when the heart is vexed
  The pain of one maidens refusal is drowned in the pain of the next

   IV
  The temper of chums the love of your wife and a new pianos tune
  Which of the three will you trust at the end of an Indian June

     V
  Who are the rulers of Indto whom shall we bow the knee
  Make your peace with the women and men will make you L G

   VI
  Does the woodpecker flit round the young ferash
  Does grass clothe a newbuilt wall
  Is she under thirty the woman who holds a boy in her thrall

   VII
  If She grow suddenly graciousreflect Is it all for thee
  The blackbuck is stalked through the bullock and Man through jealousy

   VIII
  Seek not for favor of women So shall you find it indeed
  Does not the boar break cover just when youre lighting a weed

   IX
  If He play being young and unskilful for shekels of silver and gold
  Take his money my son praising Allah The kid was ordained to be sold

     X
  With a weed among men or horses verily this is the best
  That you work him in office or dogcart lightlybut give him no rest

   XI
  Pleasant the snaffle of Courtship improving the manners and carriage
  But the colt who is wise will abstain from the terrible thornbit of Marriage

   XII
  As the thriftless gold of the babul so is the gold that we spend
  On a derby Sweep or our neighbors wife or the horse that we buy from a
  friend

   XIII
  The ways of man with a maid be strange yet simple and tame
  To the ways of a man with a horse when selling or racing that same

   XIV
  In public Her face turneth to thee and pleasant Her smile when ye meet
  It is ill The cold rocks of ElGidar smile thus on the waves at their feet

  In public Her face is averted with anger She nameth thy name
  It is well Was there ever a loser content with the loss of the game

   XV
  If She have spoken a word remember thy lips are sealed
  And the Brand of the Dog is upon him by whom is the secret revealed

  If She have written a letter delay not an instant but burn it
  Tear it to pieces O Fool and the wind to her mate shall return it

  If there be trouble to Herward and a lie of the blackest can clear
  Lie while thy lips can move or a man is alive to hear

   XVI
  My Son if a maiden deny thee and scufflingly bid thee give oer
  Yet lip meets with lip at the last wordget out
    She has been there before
  They are pecked on the ear and the chin and the nose who are lacking in lore

   XVII
  If we fall in the race though we win the hoofslide is scarred on the
  course
  Though Allah and Earth pardon Sin remaineth forever Remorse

   XVIII
  By all I am misunderstood if the Matron shall say or the Maid
  Alas I do not understand my son be thou nowise afraid

  In vain in the sight of the Bird is the net of the Fowler displayed

   XIX
  My son if I Hafiz the father take hold of thy knees in my pain
  Demanding thy name on stamped paper one day or one hourrefrain

  Are the links of thy fetters so light that thou cravest another mans chain




THE GRAVE OF THE HUNDRED HEAD

  Theres a widow in sleepy Chester
    Who weeps for her only son
  Theres a grave on the Pabeng River
    A grave that the Burmans shun
  And theres Subadar Prag Tewarri
    Who tells how the work was done

  A Snider squibbed in the jungle
    Somebody laughed and fled
  And the men of the First Shikaris
    Picked up their Subaltern dead
  With a big blue mark in his forehead
    And the back blown out of his head

  Subadar Prag Tewarri
    Jemadar Hira Lal
  Took command of the party
    Twenty rifles in all
  Marched them down to the river
    As the day was beginning to fall

  They buried the boy by the river
    A blanket over his face
  They wept for their dead Lieutenant
    The men of an alien race
  They made a samadh in his honor
    A mark for his restingplace

  For they swore by the Holy Water
    They swore by the salt they ate
  That the soul of Lieutenant Eshmitt Sahib
    Should go to his God in state
  With fifty file of Burman
    To open him Heavens gate

  The men of the First Shikaris
    Marched till the break of day
  Till they came to the rebel village
    The village of Pabengmay
  A jingal covered the clearing
    Calthrops hampered the way

  Subadar Prag Tewarri
    Bidding them load with ball
  Halted a dozen rifles
    Under the village wall
  Sent out a flankingparty
    With Jemadar Hira Lal

  The men of the First Shikaris
    Shouted and smote and slew
  Turning the grinning jingal
    On to the howling crew
  The Jemadars flankingparty
    Butchered the folk who flew

  Long was the morn of slaughter
    Long was the list of slain
  Five score heads were taken
    Five score heads and twain
  And the men of the First Shikaris
    Went back to their grave again

  Each man bearing a basket
    Red as his palms that day
  Red as the blazing village
    The village of Pabengmay
  And the dripdripdrip from the baskets
    Reddened the grass by the way

  They made a pile of their trophies
    High as a tall mans chin
  Head upon head distorted
    Set in a sightless grin
  Anger and pain and terror
    Stamped on the smokescorched skin

  Subadar Prag Tewarri
    Put the head of the Boh
  On the top of the mound of triumph
    The head of his son below
  With the sword and the peacockbanner
    That the world might behold and know

  Thus the samadh was perfect
    Thus was the lesson plain
  Of the wrath of the First Shikaris
    The price of a white man slain
  And the men of the First Shikaris
    Went back into camp again

  Then a silence came to the river
    A hush fell over the shore
  And Bohs that were brave departed
    And Sniders squibbed no more
      For the Burmans said
      That a kullahs head
  Must be paid for with heads five score

  Theres a widow in sleepy Chester
    Who weeps for her only son
  Theres a grave on the Pabeng River
    A grave that the Burmans shun
  And theres Subadar Prag Tewarri
    Who tells how the work was done




THE MOON OF OTHER DAYS

  Beneath the deep verandas shade
    When bats begin to fly
  I sit me down and watchalas
    Another evening die

  Bloodred behind the sere ferash
    She rises through the haze
  Sainted Diana can that be
    The Moon of Other Days

  Ah shade of little Kitty Smith
    Sweet Saint of Kensington
  Say was it ever thus at Home
    The Moon of August shone
  When arm in arm we wandered long
    Through Putneys evening haze
  And Hammersmith was Heaven beneath
    The Moon of Other Days

  But Wandles stream is Sutlej now
    And Putneys evening haze
  The dust that half a hundred kine
    Before my window raise
  Unkempt unclean athwart the mist
    The seething city looms
  In place of Putneys golden gorse
    The sickly babul blooms

  Glare down old Hecate through the dust
    And bid the piedog yell
  Draw from the drain its typhoidgerm
    From each bazaar its smell
  Yea suck the fever from the tank
    And sap my strength therewith
  Thank Heaven you show a smiling face
    To little Kitty Smith




THE OVERLAND MAIL
  FootService to the Hills

  In the name of the Empress of India make way
    O Lords of the Jungle wherever you roam
  The woods are astir at the close of the day
    We exiles are waiting for letters from Home
  Let the robber retreatlet the tiger turn tail
  In the Name of the Empress the Overland Mail

  With a jingle of bells as the dusk gathers in
    He turns to the footpath that heads up the hill
  The bags on his back and a cloth round his chin
    And tucked in his waistbelt the Post Office bill
  Despatched on this date as received by the rail
  Per runner two bags of the Overland Mail

  Is the torrent in spate He must ford it or swim
    Has the rain wrecked the road He must climb by the cliff
  Does the tempest cry Halt What are tempests to him
    The Service admits not a but or and if
   While the breaths in his mouth he must bear without fail
  In the Name of the Empress the Overland Mail

  From aloe to roseoak from roseoak to fir
    From level to upland from upland to crest
  From ricefield to rockridge from rockridge to spur
    Fly the soft sandalled feet strains the brawny brown chest
  From rail to ravineto the peak from the vale
  Up up through the night goes the Overland Mail

  Theres a speck on the hillside a dot on the road
    A jingle of bells on the footpath below
  Theres a scuffle above in the monkeys abode
    The world is awake and the clouds are aglow

  For the great Sun himself must attend to the hail
  In the name of the Empress the Overland Mail




WHAT THE PEOPLE SAID
  June st 

  By the well where the bullocks go
  Silent and blind and slow
  By the field where the young corn dies
  In the face of the sultry skies
  They have heard as the dull Earth hears
  The voice of the wind of an hour
  The sound of the Great Queens voice
  My God hath given me years
  Hath granted dominion and power
  And I bid you O Land rejoice

  And the ploughman settles the share
  More deep in the grudging clod
  For he saith The wheat is my care
  And the rest is the will of God

  He sent the Mahratta spear
  As He sendeth the rain
  And the Mlech in the fated year
  Broke the spear in twain

  And was broken in turn Who knows
  How our Lords make strife
  It is good that the young wheat grows
  For the bread is Life

  Then far and near as the twilight drew
  Hissed up to the scornful dark
  Great serpents blazing of red and blue
  That rose and faded and rose anew

  That the Land might wonder and mark
  Today is a day of days they said
  Make merry O People all
   And the Ploughman listened and bowed his head
  Today and tomorrow Gods will he said
  As he trimmed the lamps on the wall

  He sendeth us years that are good
  As He sendeth the dearth
  He giveth to each man his food
  Or Her food to the Earth

  Our Kings and our Queens are afar
  On their peoples be peace
  God bringeth the rain to the Bar
  That our cattle increase

  And the Ploughman settled the share
  More deep in the sundried clod
  Mogul Mahratta and Mlech from the North
  And White Queen over the Seas
  God raiseth them up and driveth them forth
  As the dust of the ploughshare flies in the breeze
  But the wheat and the cattle are all my care
  And the rest is the will of God




THE UNDERTAKERS HORSE

  Totschinshu is condemned to death
  How can he drink tea with the Executioner
   Japanese Proverb

  The eldest son bestrides him
  And the pretty daughter rides him
  And I meet him oft o mornings on the Course
  And there kindles in my bosom
  An emotion chill and gruesome
  As I canter past the Undertakers Horse

  Neither shies he nor is restive
  But a hideously suggestive
  Trot professional and placid he affects
  And the cadence of his hoofbeats
  To my mind this grim reproof beats
  Mend your pace my friend Im coming Whos the next

  Ah studbred of illomen
  I have watched the strongest gomen
  Of pith and might and muscleat your heels
  Down the plantainbordered highway
  Heaven send it neer be my way
  In a lacquered box and jetty upon wheels

  Answer sombre beast and dreary
  Where is Brown the young the cheery
  Smith the pride of all his friends and half the Force
  You were at that last dread dak
  We must cover at a walk
  Bring them back to me O Undertakers Horse

  With your mane unhogged and flowing
  And your curious way of going
  And that businesslike black crimping of your tail
  Een with Beauty on your back Sir
  Pacing as a ladys hack Sir
  What wonder when I meet you I turn pale

  It may be you wait your time Beast
  Till I write my last bad rhyme Beast
  Quit the sunlight cut the rhyming drop the glass
  Follow after with the others
  Where some dusky heathen smothers
  Us with marigolds in lieu of English grass

  Or perchance in years to follow
  I shall watch your plump sides hollow
  See Carnifex gone lame become a corse
  See old age at last oerpower you
  And the Station Pack devour you
  I shall chuckle then O Undertakers Horse

  But to insult jibe and quest Ive
  Still the hideously suggestive
  Trot that hammers out the unrelenting text
  And I hear it hard behind me
  In what place soeer I find me
  Sure to catch you sooner or later Whos the next




THE FALL OF JOCK GILLESPIE

  This fell when dinnertime was done
    Twixt the first an the second rub
  That oor mon Jock cam hame again
    To his rooms ahist the Club

  An syne he laughed an syne he sang
    An syne we thocht him fou
  An syne he trumped his partners trick
    An garred his partner rue

  Then up and spake an elder mon
    That held the Spade its Ace
  God save the lad Whence comes the licht
    That wimples on his face

  An Jock he sniggered an Jock he smiled
    An ower the cardbrim wunk
  Im a too fresh fra the stirruppeg
    May be that I am drunk

  Theres whusky brewed in Galashils
    An L L L forbye
  But never liquor lit the lowe
    That keeks fra oot your eye

  Theres a third o hair on your dresscoat breast
    Aboon the heart a wee
   Oh that is fra the langhaired Skye
    That slobbers ower me

  Oh langhaired Skyes are lovin beasts
    An terrier dogs are fair
  But never yet was terrier born
    Wi elllang gowden hair

  Theres a smirch o pouther on your breast
    Below the left lappel
   Oh that is fra my auld cigar
    Whenas the stumpend fell

  Mon Jock ye smoke the Trichi coarse
    For ye are short o cash
  An best Havanas couldna leave
    Sae white an pure an ash

  This nicht ye stopped a story braid
    An stopped it wi a curse
  Last nicht ye told that tale yoursel
    An capped it wi a worse

  Oh were no fou Oh were no fou
    But plainly we can ken
  Yere fallin fallin fra the band
    O cantie single men

  An it fell when sirrisshaws were sere
    An the nichts were lang and mirk
  In braw new breeks wi a gowden ring
    Oor Jock gaed to the Kirk




ARITHMETIC ON THE FRONTIER

  A great and glorious thing it is
    To learn for seven years or so
  The Lord knows what of that and this
    Ere reckoned fit to face the foe
  The flying bullet down the Pass
  That whistles clear All flesh is grass

  Three hundred pounds per annum spent
    On making brain and body meeter
  For all the murderous intent
    Comprised in villainous saltpetre
   And afterask the Yusufzaies
  What comes of all our ologies

  A scrimmage in a Border Station
    A canter down some dark defile
  Two thousand pounds of education
    Drops to a tenrupee jezail
  The Crammers boast the Squadrons pride
  Shot like a rabbit in a ride

  No proposition Euclid wrote
    No formulae the textbooks know
  Will turn the bullet from your coat
    Or ward the tulwars downward blow
  Strike hard who caresshoot straight who can
  The odds are on the cheaper man

  One swordknot stolen from the camp
    Will pay for all the school expenses
  Of any Kurrum Valley scamp
    Who knows no word of moods and tenses
  But being blessed with perfect sight
  Picks off our messmates left and right

  With homebred hordes the hillsides teem
    The troopships bring us one by one
  At vast expense of time and steam
    To slay Afridis where they run

  The captives of our bow and spear
   Are cheapalas as we are dear




THE BETROTHED

  You must choose between me and your cigar
          BREACH OF PROMISE CASE CIRCA 

  Open the old cigarbox get me a Cuba stout
  For things are running crossways and Maggie and I are out

  We quarrelled about Havanaswe fought oer a good cheroot
  And I knew she is exacting and she says I am a brute

  Open the old cigarboxlet me consider a space
  In the soft blue veil of the vapour musing on Maggies face

  Maggie is pretty to look atMaggies a loving lass
  But the prettiest cheeks must wrinkle the truest of loves must pass

  Theres peace in a Larranaga theres calm in a Henry Clay
  But the best cigar in an hour is finished and thrown away

  Thrown away for another as perfect and ripe and brown
  But I could not throw away Maggie for fear o the talk o the town

  Maggie my wife at fiftygrey and dour and old
  With never another Maggie to purchase for love or gold

  And the light of Days that have Been the dark of the Days that Are
  And Loves torch stinking and stale like the butt of a dead cigar

  The butt of a dead cigar you are bound to keep in your pocket
  With never a new one to light tho its charred and black to the socket

  Open the old cigarboxlet me consider a while
  Here is a mild Manilathere is a wifely smile

  Which is the better portionbondage bought with a ring
  Or a harem of dusky beauties fifty tied in a string

  Counsellors cunning and silentcomforters true and tried
  And never a one of the fifty to sneer at a rival bride

  Thought in the early morning solace in time of woes
  Peace in the hush of the twilight balm ere my eyelids close

  This will the fifty give me asking nought in return
  With only a Suttees passionto do their duty and burn

  This will the fifty give me When they are spent and dead
  Five times other fifties shall be my servants instead

  The furrows of faroff Java the isles of the Spanish Main
  When they hear my harem is empty will send me my brides again

  I will take no heed to their raiment nor food for their mouths withal
  So long as the gulls are nesting so long as the showers fall

  I will scent em with best vanilla with tea will I temper their hides
  And the Moor and the Mormon shall envy who read of the tale of my brides

  For Maggie has written a letter to give me my choice between
  The wee little whimpering Love and the great god Nick o Teen

  And I have been servant of Love for barely a twelvemonth clear
  But I have been Priest of Cabanas a matter of seven year

  And the gloom of my bachelor days is flecked with the cheery light
  Of stumps that I burned to Friendship and Pleasure and Work and Fight

  And I turn my eyes to the future that Maggie and I must prove
  But the only light on the marshes is the WillotheWisp of Love

  Will it see me safe through my journey or leave me bogged in the mire
  Since a puff of tobacco can cloud it shall I follow the fitful fire

  Open the old cigarboxlet me consider anew
  Old friends and who is Maggie that I should abandon you

  A million surplus Maggies are willing to bear the yoke
  And a woman is only a woman but a good Cigar is a Smoke

  Light me another CubaI hold to my firstsworn vows
  If Maggie will have no rival Ill have no Maggie for Spouse




A TALE OF TWO CITIES

  Where the sobercolored cultivator smiles
      On his byles
  Where the cholera the cyclone and the crow
      Come and go
  Where the merchant deals in indigo and tea
      Hides and ghi
  Where the Babu drops inflammatory hints
      In his prints
  Stands a CityCharnock chose itpacked away
      Near a Bay
  By the Sewage rendered fetid by the sewer
      Made impure
  By the Sunderbunds unwholesome by the swamp
      Moist and damp
  And the City and the Viceroy as we see
      Dont agree

  Once two hundred years ago the trader came
      Meek and tame

  Where his timid foot first halted there he stayed
      Till mere trade
  Grew to Empire and he sent his armies forth
      South and North
  Till the country from Peshawur to Ceylon
      Was his own

  Thus the midday halt of Charnockmores the pity
      Grew a City

  As the fungus sprouts chaotic from its bed
      So it spread
  Chancedirected chanceerected laid and built
      On the silt
  Palace byre hovelpoverty and pride
      Side by side
  And above the packed and pestilential town
      Death looked down

  But the Rulers in that City by the Sea
      Turned to flee
  Fled with each returning springtide from its ills
      To the Hills

  From the clammy fogs of morning from the blaze
      Of old days
  From the sickness of the noontide from the heat
      Beat retreat
  For the country from Peshawur to Ceylon
      Was their own

  But the Merchant risked the perils of the Plain
      For his gain

  Now the restingplace of Charnock neath the palms
      Asks an alms
  And the burden of its lamentation is
      Briefly this
  Because for certain months we boil and stew
      So should you

  Cast the Viceroy and his Council to perspire
      In our fire
   And for answer to the argument in vain
      We explain
  That an amateur Saint Lawrence cannot fry
      All must fry
   That the Merchant risks the perils of the Plain
      For gain

  Nor can Rulers rule a house that men grow rich in
      From its kitchen

  Let the Babu drop inflammatory hints
    In his prints
  And matureconsistent soulhis plan for stealing
    To Darjeeling
  Let the Merchant seek who makes his silver pile
      Englands isle
  Let the City Charnock pitched onevil day
      Go Her way

  Though the argosies of Asia at Her doors
      Heap their stores
  Though Her enterprise and energy secure
      Income sure
  Though outstation orders punctually obeyed
       Swell Her trade
  Still for rule administration and the rest
      Simlas best

THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST

       Oh East is East and West is West and never the twain shall
  meet
       Till Earth and Sky stand presently at Gods great Judgment
  Seat
       But there is neither East nor West Border nor Breed nor Birth
       When two strong men stand face to face
         tho they come from the ends of the earth

  Kamal is out with twenty men to raise the Borderside
  And he has lifted the Colonels mare that is the Colonels pride
  He has lifted her out of the stabledoor between the dawn and the day
  And turned the calkins upon her feet and ridden her far away

  Then up and spoke the Colonels son that led a troop of the Guides
  Is there never a man of all my men can say where Kamal hides
   Then up and spoke Mahommed Khan the son of the Ressaldar
  If ye know the track of the morningmist ye know where his pickets are

  At dusk he harries the Abazaiat dawn he is into Bonair
  But he must go by Fort Bukloh to his own place to fare
  So if ye gallop to Fort Bukloh as fast as a bird can fly
  By the favour of God ye may cut him off ere he win to the Tongue of Jagai

  But if he be past the Tongue of Jagai right swiftly turn ye then
  For the length and the breadth of that grisly plain is sown with Kamals men
  There is rock to the left and rock to the right and low lean thorn between
  And ye may hear a breechbolt snick where never a man is seen

  The Colonels son has taken a horse and a raw rough dun was he
  With the mouth of a bell and the heart of Hell and the head of the
       gallowstree

  The Colonels son to the Fort has won they bid him stay to eat
  Who rides at the tail of a Border thief he sits not long at his meat

  Hes up and away from Fort Bukloh as fast as he can fly
  Till he was aware of his fathers mare in the gut of the Tongue of Jagai
  Till he was aware of his fathers mare with Kamal upon her back
  And when he could spy the white of her eye he made the pistol crack

  He has fired once he has fired twice but the whistling ball went wide
  Ye shoot like a soldier Kamal said  Show now if ye can ride

  Its up and over the Tongue of Jagai as blown dustdevils go
  The dun he fled like a stag of ten but the mare like a barren doe

  The dun he leaned against the bit and slugged his head above
  But the red mare played with the snafflebars as a maiden plays with a glove

  There was rock to the left and rock to the right and low lean thorn between
  And thrice he heard a breechbolt snick tho never a man was seen

  They have ridden the low moon out of the sky their hoofs drum up the dawn
  The dun he went like a wounded bull but the mare like a newroused fawn

  The dun he fell at a watercoursein a woful heap fell he
  And Kamal has turned the red mare back and pulled the rider free

  He has knocked the pistol out of his handsmall room was there to strive
  Twas only by favour of mine quoth he ye rode so long alive
  There was not a rock for twenty mile there was not a clump of tree
  But covered a man of my own men with his rifle cocked on his knee

  If I had raised my bridlehand as I have held it low
  The little jackals that flee so fast were feasting all in a row
  If I had bowed my head on my breast as I have held it high
  The kite that whistles above us now were gorged till she could not fly
   Lightly answered the Colonels son  Do good to bird and beast
  But count who come for the broken meats before thou makest a feast

  If there should follow a thousand swords to carry my bones away
  Belike the price of a jackals meal were more than a thief could pay

  They will feed their horse on the standing crop their men on the garnered
  grain
  The thatch of the byres will serve their fires when all the cattle are
  slain
  But if thou thinkest the price be fairthy brethren wait to sup
  The hound is kin to the jackalspawnhowl dog and call them up
  And if thou thinkest the price be high in steer and gear and stack
  Give me my fathers mare again and Ill fight my own way back

  Kamal has gripped him by the hand and set him upon his feet
  No talk shall be of dogs said he when wolf and gray wolf meet

  May I eat dirt if thou hast hurt of me in deed or breath
  What dam of lances brought thee forth to jest at the dawn with Death
   Lightly answered the Colonels son  I hold by the blood of my clan
  Take up the mare for my fathers giftby God she has carried a man
   The red mare ran to the Colonels son and nuzzled against his breast
  We be two strong men said Kamal then but she loveth the younger best

  So she shall go with a lifters dower my turquoisestudded rein
  My broidered saddle and saddlecloth and silver stirrups twain
   The Colonels son a pistol drew and held it muzzleend
  Ye have taken the one from a foe said he
    will ye take the mate from a friend
   A gift for a gift said Kamal straight a limb for the risk of a limb

  Thy father has sent his son to me Ill send my son to him
   With that he whistled his only son that dropped from a mountaincrest
  He trod the ling like a buck in spring and he looked like a lance in rest

  Now here is thy master Kamal said who leads a troop of the Guides
  And thou must ride at his left side as shield on shoulder rides
  Till Death or I cut loose the tie at camp and board and bed
  Thy life is histhy fate it is to guard him with thy head

  So thou must eat the White Queens meat and all her foes are thine
  And thou must harry thy fathers hold for the peace of the Borderline
  And thou must make a trooper tough and hack thy way to power
  Belike they will raise thee to Ressaldar when I am hanged in Peshawur

  They have looked each other between the eyes and there they found no fault
  They have taken the Oath of the BrotherinBlood on leavened bread and salt
  They have taken the Oath of the BrotherinBlood on fire and freshcut sod
  On the hilt and the haft of the Khyber knife and the Wondrous Names of God

  The Colonels son he rides the mare and Kamals boy the dun
  And two have come back to Fort Bukloh where there went forth but one

  And when they drew to the QuarterGuard full twenty swords flew clear
  There was not a man but carried his feud with the blood of the mountaineer

  Ha done ha done said the Colonels son
    Put up the steel at your sides
  Last night ye had struck at a Border thief
    tonight tis a man of the Guides

       Oh East is East and West is West and never the twain shall meet
       Till Earth and Sky stand presently at Gods great Judgment Seat
       But there is neither East nor West Border nor Breed nor Birth
       When two strong men stand face to face
         tho they come from the ends of the earth




THE LAST SUTTEE

  Not many years ago a King died in one of the Rajpoot States His wives
  disregarding the orders of the English against Suttee would have broken
  out of the palace had not the gates been barred

  But one of them disguised as the Kings favourite dancinggirl passed
  through the line of guards and reached the pyre  There her courage
  failing she prayed her cousin a baron of the court to kill her  This
  he did not knowing who she was


  Udai Chand lay sick to death
      In his hold by Gungra hill
  All night we heard the deathgongs ring
  For the soul of the dying Rajpoot King
  All night beat up from the womens wing
      A cry that we could not still

  All night the barons came and went
      The lords of the outer guard
  All night the cressets glimmered pale
  On Ulwar sabre and Tonk jezail
  Mewar headstall and Marwar mail
      That clinked in the palace yard

  In the Golden room on the palace roof
      All night he fought for air
  And there was sobbing behind the screen
  Rustle and whisper of women unseen
  And the hungry eyes of the Boondi Queen
      On the death she might not share

  He passed at dawnthe deathfire leaped
      From ridge to riverhead
  From the Malwa plains to the Abu scars
  And wail upon wail went up to the stars
  Behind the grim zenanabars
      When they knew that the King was dead

  The dumb priest knelt to tie his mouth
      And robe him for the pyre
  The Boondi Queen beneath us cried
  See now that we die as our mothers died
  In the bridalbed by our masters side
      Out womento the fire

  We drove the great gates home apace
      White hands were on the sill
  But ere the rush of the unseen feet
  Had reached the turn to the open street
  The bars shot down the guarddrum beat
      We held the dovecot still

  A face looked down in the gathering day
      And laughing spoke from the wall
  Ohe they mourn here  let me by
  Azizun the  Lucknow nautchgirl I
  When the house is rotten the rats must fly
      And I seek another thrall

  For I ruled the King as neer did Queen
      Tonight the Queens rule me
  Guard them safely but let me go
  Or ever they pay the debt they owe
  In scourge and torture  She leaped below
      And the grim guard watched her flee

  They knew that the King had spent his soul
      On a Northbred dancinggirl
  That he prayed to a flatnosed Lucknow god
  And kissed the ground where her feet had trod
  And doomed to death at her drunken nod
      And swore by her lightest curl

  We bore the King to his fathers place
      Where the tombs of the Sunborn stand
  Where the gray apes swing and the peacocks preen
  On fretted pillar and jewelled screen
  And the wild boar couch in the house of the Queen
      On the drift of the desert sand

  The herald read his titles forth
      We set the logs aglow
  Friend of the English free from fear
  Baron of Luni to Jeysulmeer
  Lord of the Desert of Bikaneer
      King of the Junglego

  All night the red flame stabbed the sky
      With wavering windtossed spears
  And out of a shattered temple crept
  A woman who veiled her head and wept
  And called on the Kingbut the great King slept
      And turned not for her tears

  Small thought had he to mark the strife
      Cold fear with hot desire
  When thrice she leaped from the leaping flame
  And thrice she beat her breast for shame
  And thrice like a wounded dove she came
      And moaned about the fire

  One watched a bowshot from the blaze
      The silent streets between
  Who had stood by the King in sport and fray
  To blade in ambush or boar at bay
  And he was a baron old and gray
      And kin to the Boondi Queen

  He said O shameless put aside
      The veil upon thy brow
  Who held the King and all his land
  To the wanton will of a harlots hand
  Will the white ash rise from the blistered brand
      Stoop down and call him now

  Then she  By the faith of my tarnished soul
      All things I did not well
  I had hoped to clear ere the fire died
  And lay me down by my masters side
  To rule in Heaven his only bride
      While the others howl in Hell

  But I have felt the fires breath
      And hard it is to die
  Yet if I may pray a Rajpoot lord
  To sully the steel of a Thakurs sword
  With baseborn blood of a trade abhorred
      And the Thakur answered Ay

  He drew and struck  the straight blade drank
      The life beneath the breast

  I had looked for the Queen to face the flame
  But the harlot dies for the Rajpoot dame
  Sister of mine pass free from shame
      Pass with thy King to rest

  The black log crashed above the white
      The little flames and lean
  Red as slaughter and blue as steel
  That whistled and fluttered from head to heel
  Leaped up anew for they found their meal
      On the heart ofthe Boondi Queen




THE BALLAD OF THE KINGS MERCY

    Abdhur Rahman the Durani Chief
      of him is the story told
    His mercy fills the Khyber hills
      his grace is manifold
    He has taken toll of the North and the South
      his glory reacheth far
    And they tell the tale of his charity
      from Balkh to Kandahar


  Before the old Peshawur Gate where Kurd and Kaffir meet
  The Governor of Kabul dealt the Justice of the Street
  And that was strait as running noose and swift as plunging knife
  Tho he who held the longer purse might hold the longer life


  There was a hound of Hindustan had struck a Euzufzai
  Wherefore they spat upon his face and led him out to die

  It chanced the King went forth that hour when throat was bared to knife
  The Kaffir grovelled underhoof and clamoured for his life


  Then said the King  Have hope O friend  Yea Death disgraced is hard
  Much honour shall be thine and called the Captain of the Guard
  Yar Khan a bastard of the Blood so citybabble saith
  And he was honoured of the Kingthe which is salt to Death
  And he was son of Daoud Shah the Reiver of the Plains
  And blood of old Durani Lords ran fire in his veins
  And twas to tame an Afghan pride nor Hell nor Heaven could bind
  The King would make him butcher to a yelping cur of Hind


  Strike said the King Kings blood art thouhis death shall be his
  pride
   Then louder that the crowd might catch  Fear nothis arms are tied
   Yar Khan drew clear the Khyber knife and struck and sheathed again
  O man thy will is done quoth he a King this dog hath slain

    Abdhur Rahman the Durani Chief
      to the North and the South is sold
    The North and the South shall open their mouth
      to a Ghilzai flag unrolled
    When the big guns speak to the Khyber peak
      and his dogHeratis fly
    Ye have heard the songHow long How long
      Wolves of the Abazai

  That night before the watch was set when all the streets were clear
  The Governor of Kabul spoke  My King hast thou no fear
  Thou knowestthou hast heardhis speech died at his masters face

  And grimly said the Afghan King  I rule the Afghan race
  My path is minesee thou to thinetonight upon thy bed
  Think who there be in Kabul now that clamour for thy head

  That night when all the gates were shut to City and to throne
  Within a little gardenhouse the King lay down alone

  Before the sinking of the moon which is the Night of Night
  Yar Khan came softly to the King to make his honour white
  The children of the town had mocked beneath his horses hoofs
  The harlots of the town had hailed him butcher from their roofs

  But as he groped against the wall two hands upon him fell
  The King behind his shoulder spake  Dead man thou dost not well
  Tis ill to jest with Kings by day and seek a boon by night
  And that thou bearest in thy hand is all too sharp to write

  But three days hence if God be good and if thy strength remain
  Thou shalt demand one boon of me and bless me in thy pain
  For I am merciful to all and most of all to thee

  My butcher of the shambles restno knife hast thou for me

    Abdhur Rahman the Durani Chief
      holds hard by the South and the North
    But the Ghilzai knows ere the melting snows
      when the swollen banks break forth
    When the redcoats crawl to the sungar wall
      and his Usbeg lances fail
    Ye have heard the songHow long How long
      Wolves of the Zuka Kheyl

  They stoned him in the rubbishfield when dawn was in the sky
  According to the written word See that he do not die

  They stoned him till the stones were piled above him on the plain
  And those the labouring limbs displaced they tumbled back again


  One watched beside the dreary mound that veiled the battered
  thing
  And him the King with laughter called the Herald of the King


  It was upon the second night the night of Ramazan
  The watcher leaning earthward heard the message of Yar Khan

  From shattered breast through shrivelled lips broke forth the rattling breath
  Creature of God deliver me from agony of Death

  They sought the King among his girls and risked their lives thereby
  Protector of the Pitiful give orders that he die

  Bid him endure until the day a lagging answer came
  The night is short and he can pray and learn to bless my name

  Before the dawn three times he spoke and on the day once more
  Creature of God deliver me and bless the King therefor

  They shot him at the morning prayer to ease him of his pain
  And when he heard the matchlocks clink he blessed the King again

  Which thing the singers made a song for all the world to sing
  So that the Outer Seas may know the mercy of the King

    Abdhur Rahman the Durani Chief
      of him is the story told
    He has opened his mouth to the North and the South
      they have stuffed his mouth with gold

    Ye know the truth of his tender ruth
      and sweet his favours are
    Ye have heard the songHow long How long
      from Balkh to Kandahar




THE BALLAD OF THE KINGS JEST

  When springtime flushes the desert grass
  Our kafilas wind through the Khyber Pass

  Lean are the camels but fat the frails
  Light are the purses but heavy the bales
  As the snowbound trade of the North comes down
  To the marketsquare of Peshawur town

  In a turquoise twilight crisp and chill
  A kafila camped at the foot of the hill

  Then blue smokehaze of the cooking rose
  And tentpeg answered to hammernose
  And the picketed ponies shag and wild
  Strained at their ropes as the feed was piled
  And the bubbling camels beside the load
  Sprawled for a furlong adown the road
  And the Persian pussycats brought for sale
  Spat at the dogs from the camelbale
  And the tribesmen bellowed to hasten the food
  And the campfires twinkled by Fort Jumrood
  And there fled on the wings of the gathering dusk
  A savour of camels and carpets and musk
  A murmur of voices a reek of smoke
  To tell us the trade of the Khyber woke

  The lid of the fleshpot chattered high
  The knives were whetted andthen came I
  To Mahbub Ali the muleteer
  Patching his bridles and counting his gear
  Crammed with the gossip of half a year

  But Mahbub Ali the kindly said
  Better is speech when the belly is fed
   So we plunged the hand to the midwrist deep
  In a cinnamon stew of the fattailed sheep
  And he who never hath tasted the food
  By Allah he knoweth not bad from good

  We cleansed our beards of the muttongrease
  We lay on the mats and were filled with peace
  And the talk slid north and the talk slid south
  With the sliding puffs from the hookahmouth

  Four things greater than all things are
  Women and Horses and Power and War

  We spake of them all but the last the most
  For I sought a word of a Russian post
  Of a shifty promise an unsheathed sword
  And a graycoat guard on the Helmund ford

  Then Mahbub Ali lowered his eyes
  In the fashion of one who is weaving lies

  Quoth he Of the Russians who can say
  When the night is gathering all is gray
  But we look that the gloom of the night shall die
  In the morning flush of a bloodred sky

  Friend of my heart is it meet or wise
  To warn a King of his enemies
  We know what Heaven or Hell may bring
  But no man knoweth the mind of the King

  That unsought counsel is cursed of God
  Attesteth the story of Wali Dad

  His sire was leaky of tongue and pen
  His dam was a clucking Khuttuck hen
  And the colt bred close to the vice of each
  For he carried the curse of an unstanched speech

  Therewith madnessso that he sought
  The favour of kings at the Kabul court
  And travelled in hope of honour far
  To the line where the graycoat squadrons are

  There have I journeyed toobut I
  Saw naught said naught anddid not die
  He harked to rumour and snatched at a breath
  Of this one knoweth and that one saith
  Legends that ran from mouth to mouth
  Of a graycoat coming and sack of the South

  These have I also heardthey pass
  With each new spring and the winter grass

  Hotfoot southward forgotten of God
  Back to the city ran Wali Dad
  Even to Kabulin full durbar
  The King held talk with his Chief in War

  Into the press of the crowd he broke
  And what he had heard of the coming spoke


  Then Gholam Hyder the Red Chief smiled
  As a mother might on a babbling child
  But those who would laugh restrained their breath
  When the face of the King showed dark as death

  Evil it is in full durbar
  To cry to a ruler of gathering war
  Slowly he led to a peachtree small
  That grew by a cleft of the city wall

  And he said to the boy They shall praise thy zeal
  So long as the red spurt follows the steel

  And the Russ is upon us even now
  Great is thy prudenceawait them thou
  Watch from the tree  Thou art young and strong
  Surely thy vigil is not for long

  The Russ is upon us thy clamour ran
  Surely an hour shall bring their van
  Wait and watch  When the host is near
  Shout aloud that my men may hear

  Friend of my heart is it meet or wise
  To warn a King of his enemies
  A guard was set that he might not flee
  A score of bayonets ringed the tree

  The peachbloom fell in showers of snow
  When he shook at his death as he looked below
  By the power of God who alone is great
  Till the seventh day he fought with his fate

  Then madness took him and men declare
  He mowed in the branches as ape and bear
  And last as a sloth ere his body failed
  And he hung as a bat in the forks and wailed
  And sleep the cord of his hands untied
  And he fell and was caught on the points and died

  Heart of my heart is it meet or wise
  To warn a King of his enemies
  We know what Heaven or Hell may bring
  But no man knoweth the mind of the King

  Of the graycoat coming who can say
  When the night is gathering all is gray

  To things greater than all things are
  The first is Love and the second War

  And since we know not how War may prove
  Heart of my heart let us talk of Love




THE BALLAD OF BOH DA THONE

            This is the ballad of Boh Da Thone
            Erst a Pretender to Theebaws throne
            Who harried the district of Alalone
            How he met with his fate and the VPP

            At the hand of Harendra Mukerji
            Senior Gomashta GBT

  Boh Da Thone was a warrior bold
  His sword and his Snider were bossed with gold

  And the Peacock Banner his henchmen bore
  Was stiff with bullion but stiffer with gore

  He shot at the strong and he slashed at the weak
  From the Salween scrub to the Chindwin teak

  He crucified noble he sacrificed mean
  He filled old ladies with kerosene

  While over the water the papers cried
  The patriot fights for his countryside

  But little they cared for the Native Press
  The worn white soldiers in Khaki dress

  Who tramped through the jungle and camped in the byre
  Who died in the swamp and were tombed in the mire

  Who gave up their lives at the Queens Command
  For the Pride of their Race and the Peace of the Land

  Now first of the foemen of Boh Da Thone
  Was Captain ONeil of the Black Tyrone
  And his was a Company seventy strong
  Who hustled that dissolute Chief along

  There were lads from Galway and Louth and Meath
  Who went to their death with a joke in their teeth
  And worshipped with fluency fervour and zeal
  The mud on the bootheels of Crook ONeil

  But ever a blight on their labours lay
  And ever their quarry would vanish away
  Till the sundried boys of the Black Tyrone
  Took a brotherly interest in Boh Da Thone
  And sooth if pursuit in possession ends
  The Boh and his trackers were best of friends

  The word of a scouta march by night
  A rush through the mista scattering fight
  A volley from covera corpse in the clearing
  The glimpse of a loincloth and heavy jade earring
  The flare of a villagethe tally of slain
  Andthe Boh was abroad on the raid again

  They cursed their luck as the Irish will
  They gave him credit for cunning and skill
  They buried their dead they bolted their beef
  And started anew on the track of the thief
  Till in place of the Kalends of Greece men said
  When Crook and his darlings come back with the head

  They had hunted the Boh from the hills to the plain
  He doubled and broke for the hills again
  They had crippled his power for rapine and raid
  They had routed him out of his pet stockade
  And at last they came when the Day Star tired
  To a camp deserteda village fired

  A black cross blistered the Morninggold
  And the body upon it was stark and cold
  The wind of the dawn went merrily past
  The high grass bowed her plumes to the blast

  And out of the grass on a sudden broke
  A spirtle of fire a whorl of smoke

  And Captain ONeil of the Black Tyrone
  Was blessed with a slug in the ulnarbone
  The gift of his enemy Boh Da Thone

  Now a slug that is hammered from telegraphwire
  Is a thorn in the flesh and a rankling fire
              

  The shotwound festeredas shotwounds may
  In a steaming barrack at Mandalay

  The left arm throbbed and the Captain swore
  Id like to be after the Boh once more
   The fever held himthe Captain said
  Id give a hundred to look at his head

  The Hospital punkahs creaked and whirred
  But Babu Harendra Gomashta heard

  He thought of the canebrake green and dank
  That girdled his home by the Dacca tank
  He thought of his wife and his High School son
  He thoughtbut abandoned the thoughtof a gun
  His sleep was broken by visions dread
  Of a shining Boh with a silver head

  He kept his counsel and went his way
  And swindled the cartmen of half their pay

              

  And the months went on as the worst must do
  And the Boh returned to the raid anew

  But the Captain had quitted the longdrawn strife
  And in far Simoorie had taken a wife
  And she was a damsel of delicate mould
  With hair like the sunshine and heart of gold

  And little she knew the arms that embraced
  Had cloven a man from the brow to the waist
  And little she knew that the loving lips
  Had ordered a quivering lifes eclipse

  And the eye that lit at her lightest breath
  Had glared unawed in the Gates of Death

  For these be matters a man would hide
  As a general rule from an innocent Bride

  And little the Captain thought of the past
  And of all men Babu Harendra last

              

  But slow in the sludge of the Kathun road
  The Government Bullock Train toted its load
  Speckless and spotless and shining with ghee
  In the rearmost cart sat the Babujee

  And ever a phantom before him fled
  Of a scowling Boh with a silver head

  Then the leadcart stuck though the coolies slaved
  And the cartmen flogged and the escort raved
  And out of the jungle with yells and squeals
  Pranced Boh Da Thone and his gang at his heels

  Then belching blunderbuss answered back
  The Sniders snarl and the carbines crack
  And the blithe revolver began to sing
  To the blade that twanged on the lockingring
  And the brown flesh blued where the baynet kissed
  As the steel shot back with a wrench and a twist
  And the great white bullocks with onyx eyes
  Watched the souls of the dead arise
  And over the smoke of the fusillade
  The Peacock Banner staggered and swayed

  Oh gayest of scrimmages man may see
  Is a wellworked rush on the GBT

  The Babu shook at the horrible sight
  And girded his ponderous loins for flight
  But Fate had ordained that the Boh should start
  On a lonehand raid of the rearmost cart
  And out of that cart with a bellow of woe
  The Babu fellflat on the top of the Boh

  For years had Harendra served the State
  To the growth of his purse and the girth of his pet

  There were twenty stone as the tallyman knows
  On the broad of the chest of this best of Bohs
  And twenty stone from a height discharged
  Are bad for a Boh with a spleen enlarged

  Oh short was the strugglesevere was the shock
  He dropped like a bullockhe lay like a block
  And the Babu above him convulsed with fear
  Heard the labouring lifebreath hissed out in his ear

  And thus in a fashion undignified
  The princely pest of the Chindwin died
              

  Turn now to Simoorie where lapped in his ease
  The Captain is petting the Bride on his knees
  Where the whit of the bullet the wounded mans scream
  Are mixed as the mist of some devilish dream
  Forgotten forgotten the sweat of the shambles
  Where the hilldaisy blooms and the gray monkey gambols
  From the swordbelt set free and released from the steel
  The Peace of the Lord is with Captain ONeil
              

  Up the hill to Simooriemost patient of drudges
  The bags on his shoulder the mailrunner trudges

  For Captain ONeil Sahib  One hundred and ten
  Rupees to collect on delivery
                                    Then

  Their breakfast was stopped while the screwjack and hammer
  Tore waxcloth split teakwood and chipped out the dammer

  Openeyed openmouthed on the naperys snow
  With a crash and a thud rolledthe Head of the Boh

  And gummed to the scalp was a letter which ran
                 IN FIELDING FORCE SERVICE

                      Encampment

  Dear SirI have honour to send as you said

  To mail VPP rupees hundred  Please add

  Whatever Your Honour can pass  Price of Blood
  Much cheap at one hundred and children want food

  So trusting Your Honour will somewhat retain
  True love and affection for Govt Bullock Train

  And show awful kindness to satisfy me
          I am
              Graceful Master

  As the rabbit is drawn to the rattlesnakes power
  As the smokers eye fills at the opium hour
  As a horse reaches up to the manger above
  As the waiting ear yearns for the whisper of love
  From the arms of the Bride ironvisaged and slow
  The Captain bent down to the Head of the Boh

  And een as he looked on the Thing where It lay
  Twixt the winking new spoons and the napkins array
  The freed mind fled back to the longago days
  The handtohand scufflethe smoke and the blaze
  The forced march at night and the quick rush at dawn
  The banjo at twilight the burial ere morn
  The stench of the marshesthe raw piercing smell
  When the overhand stabbingcut silenced the yell
  The oaths of his Irish that surged when they stood
  Where the black crosses hung oer the Kuttamow flood

  As a derelict ship drifts away with the tide
  The Captain went out on the Past from his Bride

  Back back through the springs to the chill of the year
  When he hunted the Boh from Maloon to Tsaleer

  As the shape of a corpse dimmers up through deep water
  In his eye lit the passionless passion of slaughter
  And men who had fought with ONeil for the life
  Had gazed on his face with less dread than his wife

  For she who had held him so long could not hold him
  Though a fourmonth Eternity should have controlled him
  But watched the twin Terrorthe head turned to head
  The scowling scarred Black and the flushed savage Red
  The spirit that changed from her knowing and flew to
  Some grim hidden Past she had never a clue to

  But It knew as It grinned for he touched it unfearing
  And muttered aloud So you kept that jade earring

  Then nodded and kindly as friend nods to friend
  Old man you fought well but you lost in the end

              

  The visions departed and Shame followed Passion
  He took what I said in this horrible fashion

  Ill write to Harendra  With language unsainted
  The Captain came back to the Bridewho had fainted

              

  And this is a fiction  No  Go to Simoorie
  And look at their baby a twelvemonth old Houri
  A pert little Irisheyed Kathleen Mavournin
  Shes always about on the Mall of a mornin

  And youll see if her right shoulderstrap is displaced
  This  Gules upon argent a Bohs Head erased




THE LAMENT OF THE BORDER CATTLE THIEF

  O woe is me for the merry life
   I led beyond the Bar
  And a treble woe for my winsome wife
   That weeps at Shalimar

  They have taken away my long jezail
   My shield and sabre fine
  And heaved me into the Central jail
   For lifting of the kine

  The steer may low within the byre
   The Jat may tend his grain
  But therell be neither loot nor fire
   Till I come back again

  And God have mercy on the Jat
   When once my fetters fall
  And Heaven defend the farmers hut
   When I am loosed from thrall

  Its woe to bend the stubborn back
   Above the grinching quern
  Its woe to hear the legbar clack
   And jingle when I turn

  But for the sorrow and the shame
   The brand on me and mine
  Ill pay you back in leaping flame
   And loss of the butchered kine

  For every cow I spared before
   In charity set free
  If I may reach my hold once more
   Ill reive an honest three

  For every time I raised the low
   That scared the dusty plain
  By sword and cord by torch and tow
   Ill light the land with twain

  Ride hard ride hard to Abazai
   Young Sahib with the yellow hair
  Lie close lie close as khuttucks lie
   Fat herds below Bonair

  The one Ill shoot at twilighttide
   At dawn Ill drive the other
  The black shall mourn for hoof and hide
   The white man for his brother

  Tis war red war Ill give you then
   War till my sinews fail
  For the wrong you have done to a chief of men
   And a thief of the Zukka Kheyl

  And if I fall to your hand afresh
   I give you leave for the sin
  That you cram my throat with the foul pigs flesh
   And swing me in the skin




THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS

  This ballad appears to refer to one of the exploits of the notorious Paul
  Jones the American pirate  It is founded on fact


    At the close of a winter day
  Their anchors down by London town the Three Great Captains lay
  And one was Admiral of the North from Solway Firth to Skye
  And one was Lord of the Wessex coast and all the lands thereby
  And one was Master of the Thames from Limehouse to Blackwall
  And he was Captain of the Fleetthe bravest of them all

  Their good guns guarded their great gray sides that were thirty foot in the
  sheer
  When there came a certain tradingbrig with news of a privateer

  Her rigging was rough with the clotted drift that drives in a Northern breeze
  Her sides were clogged with the lazy weed that spawns in the Eastern seas

  Light she rode in the rude tiderip to left and right she rolled
  And the skipper sat on the scuttlebutt and stared at an empty hold

  I ha paid Port dues for your Law quoth he and where is the Law ye boast
  If I sail unscathed from a heathen port to be robbed on a Christian coast
  Ye have smoked the hives of the Laccadives as we burn the lice in a bunk
  We tack not now to a Gallang prow or a plunging Peiho junk
  I had no fear but the seas were clear as far as a sail might fare
  Till I met with a limewashed Yankee brig that rode off Finisterre

  There were canvas blinds to his bowgun ports to screen the weight he bore
  And the signals ran for a merchantman from Sandy Hook to the Nore

  He would not fly the Rovers flagthe bloody or the black
  But now he floated the Gridiron and now he flaunted the Jack
  He spoke of the Law as he crimped my crewhe swore it was only a loan
  But when I would ask for my own again he swore it was none of my own

  He has taken my little parrakeets that nest beneath the Line
  He has stripped my rails of the shaddockfrails and the green unripened pine
  He has taken my bale of dammer and spice I won beyond the seas
  He has taken my grinning heathen godsand what should he want o these
  My foremast would not mend his boom my deckhouse patch his boats
  He has whittled the two this Yank Yahoo to peddle for shoepeg oats

  I could not fight for the failing light and a rough beamsea beside
  But I hulled him once for a clumsy crimp and twice because he lied

  Had I had guns as I had goods to work my Christian harm
  I had run him up from his quarterdeck to trade with his own yardarm
  I had nailed his ears to my capstanhead and ripped them off with a saw
  And soused them in the bilgewater and served them to him raw
  I had flung him blind in a rudderless boat to rot in the rocking dark
  I had towed him aft of his own craft a bait for his brother shark
  I had lapped him round with cocoa husk and drenched him with the oil
  And lashed him fast to his own mast to blaze above my spoil
  I had stripped his hide for my hammockside and tasselled his beard i the
  mesh
  And spitted his crew on the live bamboo that grows through the gangrened
  flesh
  I had hove him down by the mangroves brown where the mudreef sucks and
  draws
  Moored by the heel to his own keel to wait for the landcrabs claws
  He is lazar within and lime without ye can nose him far enow
  For he carries the taint of a musky shipthe reek of the slavers dhow
   The skipper looked at the tiering guns and the bulwarks tall and cold
  And the Captains Three full courteously peered down at the gutted hold
  And the Captains Three called courteously from deck to scuttlebutt
  Good Sir we ha dealt with that merchantman or ever your teeth were cut

  Your words be words of a lawless race and the Law it standeth thus
  He comes of a race that have never a Law and he never has boarded us

  We ha sold him canvas and rope and sparwe know that his price is fair
  And we know that he weeps for the lack of a Law as he rides off Finisterre

  And since he is damned for a gallowsthief by you and better than you
  We hold it meet that the English fleet should know that we hold him true
   The skipper called to the tall taffrailAnd what is that to me
  Did ever you hear of a Yankee brig that rifled a Seventythree
  Do I loom so large from your quarterdeck that I lift like a ship o
       the Line
  He has learned to run from a shotted gun and harry such craft as mine

  There is never a Law on the Cocos Keys to hold a white man in
  But we do not steal the niggers meal for that is a niggers sin

  Must he have his Law as a quid to chaw or laid in brass on his wheel
  Does he steal with tears when he buccaneers Fore Gad then why does he
  steal
   The skipper bit on a deepsea word and the word it was not sweet
  For he could see the Captains Three had signalled to the Fleet

  But three and two in white and blue the whimpering flags began
  We have heard a tale of aforeign sail but he is a merchantman
   The skipper peered beneath his palm and swore by the Great Horn Spoon
  Fore Gad the Chaplain of the Fleet would bless my picaroon
   By two and three the flags blew free to lash the laughing air
  We have sold our spars to the merchantmanwe know that his price is fair
   The skipper winked his Western eye and swore by a China storm
  They ha rigged him a Josephs jurycoat to keep his honour warm
   The halliards twanged against the tops the bunting bellied broad
  The skipper spat in the empty hold and mourned for a wasted cord

  Mastheadmasthead the signal sped by the line o the British craft
  The skipper called to his Lascar crew and put her about and laughed
  Its mainsail haul my bully boys allwell out to the seas again
  Ere they set us to paint their pirate saint or scrub at his grapnelchain

  Its foresheet free with her head to the sea and the swing of the
  unbought brine
  Well make no sport in an English court till we come as a ship o the Line
  Till we come as a ship o the Line my lads of thirty foot in the sheer
  Lifting again from the outer main with news of a privateer
  Flying his pluck at our mizzentruck for weft of Admiralty
  Heaving his head for our dipseylead in sign that we keep the sea

  Then foresheet home as she lifts to the foamwe stand on the outward
  tack
  We are paid in the coin of the white mans tradethe bezant is hard ay
  and black

  The frigatebird shall carry my word to the Kling and the OrangLaut
  How a man may sail from a heathen coast to be robbed in a Christian port
  How a man may be robbed in Christian port while Three Great Captains there
  Shall dip their flag to a slavers ragto show that his trade is fair




THE BALLAD OF THE CLAMPHERDOWN

  It was our warship Clampherdown
   Would sweep the Channel clean
  Wherefore she kept her hatches close
  When the merry Channel chops arose
   To save the bleached marine

  She had one bowgun of a hundred ton
   And a great sterngun beside
  They dipped their noses deep in the sea
  They racked their stays and stanchions free
   In the wash of the windwhipped tide

  It was our warship Clampherdown
   Fell in with a cruiser light
  That carried the dainty Hotchkiss gun
  And a pair o heels wherewith to run
   From the grip of a closefought fight

  She opened fire at seven miles
   As ye shoot at a bobbing cork
  And once she fired and twice she fired
  Till the bowgun drooped like a lily tired
   That lolls upon the stalk

  Captain the bowgun melts apace
   The deckbeams break below
  Twere well to rest for an hour or twain
  And patch the shattered plates again
    And he answered Make it so

  She opened fire within the mile
   As ye shoot at the flying duck
  And the great sterngun shot fair and true
  With the heave of the ship to the stainless blue
   And the great sternturret stuck

  Captain the turret fills with steam
   The feedpipes burst below
  You can hear the hiss of the helpless ram
  You can hear the twisted runners jam
    And he answered Turn and go

  It was our warship Clampherdown
   And grimly did she roll
  Swung round to take the cruisers fire
  As the White Whale faces the Threshers ire
   When they war by the frozen Pole

  Captain the shells are falling fast
   And faster still fall we
  And it is not meet for English stock
  To bide in the heart of an eightday clock
   The death they cannot see

  Lie down lie down my bold AB
   We drift upon her beam
  We dare not ram for she can run
  And dare ye fire another gun
   And die in the peeling steam

  It was our warship Clampherdown
   That carried an armourbelt
  But fifty feet at stern and bow
  Lay bare as the paunch of the pursers sow
   To the hail of the Nordenfeldt

  Captain they hack us through and through
   The chilled steel bolts are swift
  We have emptied the bunkers in open sea
  Their shrapnel bursts where our coal should be
    And he answered Let her drift

  It was our warship Clampherdown
   Swung round upon the tide
  Her two dumb guns glared south and north
  And the blood and the bubbling steam ran forth
   And she ground the cruisers side

  Captain they cry the fight is done
   They bid you send your sword
   And he answered Grapple her stern and bow
  They have asked for the steel  They shall have it now
   Out cutlasses and board

  It was our warship Clampherdown
   Spewed up four hundred men
  And the scalded stokers yelped delight
  As they rolled in the waist and heard the fight
   Stamp oer their steelwalled pen

  They cleared the cruiser end to end
   From conningtower to hold
  They fought as they fought in Nelsons fleet
  They were stripped to the waist they were bare to the feet
   As it was in the days of old

  It was the sinking Clampherdown
   Heaved up her battered side
  And carried a million pounds in steel
  To the cod and the corpsefed congereel
   And the scour of the Channel tide

  It was the crew of the Clampherdown
   Stood out to sweep the sea
  On a cruiser won from an ancient foe
  As it was in the days of long ago
   And as it still shall be




THE BALLAD OF THE BOLIVAR

       Seven men from all the world back to Docks again
       Rolling down the Ratcliffe Road drunk and raising Cain
       Give the girls another drink fore we sign away
       We that took the Bolivar out across the Bay

  We put out from Sunderland loaded down with rails
   We put back to Sunderland cause our cargo shifted
  We put out from Sunderlandmet the winter gales
   Seven days and seven nights to the Start we drifted

      Racketing her rivets loose smokestack white as snow
      All the coals adrift adeck half the rails below
      Leaking like a lobsterpot steering like a dray
      Out we took the Bolivar out across the Bay

  One by one the Lights came up winked and let us by
   Mile by mile we waddled on coal and focsle short
  Met a blow that laid us down heard a bulkhead fly
   Left the Wolf behind us with a twofoot list to port

      Trailing like a wounded duck working out her soul
      Clanging like a smithyshop after every roll
      Just a funnel and a mast lurching through the spray
      So we threshed the Bolivar out across the Bay

  Felt her hog and felt her sag betted when shed break
   Wondered every time she raced if shed stand the shock
  Heard the seas like drunken men pounding at her strake
   Hoped the Lord ud keep his thumb on the plummerblock

      Banged against the iron decks bilges choked with coal
      Flayed and frozen foot and hand sick of heart and soul
      Last we prayed shed buck herself into judgment Day
      Hi we cursed the Bolivarknocking round the Bay

  O her nose flung up to sky groaning to be still
   Up and down and back we went never time for breath
  Then the money paid at Lloyds caught her by the heel
   And the stars ran round and round dancin at our death

      Aching for an hours sleep dozing off between
      Heard the rotten rivets draw when she took it green
      Watched the compass chase its tail like a cat at play
      That was on the Bolivar south across the Bay


  Once we saw between the squalls lyin head to swell
   Mad with work and weariness wishin they was we
  Some damned Liners lights go by like a long hotel
   Cheered her from the Bolivarswampin in the sea

      Then a grayback cleared us out then the skipper laughed
      Boys the wheel has gone to Hellrig the winches aft
      Yoke the kicking rudderheadget her under way
       So we steered her pulleyhaul out across the Bay

  Just a pack o rotten plates puttied up with tar
  In we came an time enough cross Bilbao Bar

      Overloaded undermanned meant to founder we
      Euchred God Almightys storm bluffed the Eternal Sea

       Seven men from all the world back to town again
       Rollin down the Ratcliffe Road drunk and raising Cain
       Seven men from out of Hell  Aint the owners gay
       Cause we took the Bolivar safe across the Bay




THE ENGLISH FLAG

       Above the portico a flagstaff bearing the Union Jack
       remained fluttering in the flames for some time but ultimately
       when it fell the crowds rent the air with shouts
       and seemed to see significance in the incidentDAILY PAPERS


  Winds of the World give answer  They are whimpering to and fro
  And what should they know of England who only England know
  The poor little streetbred people that vapour and fume and brag
  They are lifting their heads in the stillness to yelp at the English Flag

  Must we borrow a clout from the Boerto plaster anew with dirt
  An Irish liars bandage or an English cowards shirt

  We may not speak of England her Flags to sell or share
  What is the Flag of England  Winds of the World declare

  The North Wind blewFrom Bergen my steelshod vanguards go
  I chase your lazy whalers home from the Disko floe
  By the great North Lights above me I work the will of God
  And the liner splits on the icefield or the Dogger fills with cod

  I barred my gates with iron I shuttered my doors with flame
  Because to force my ramparts your nutshell navies came
  I took the sun from their presence I cut them down with my blast
  And they died but the Flag of England blew free ere the spirit passed

  The lean white bear hath seen it in the long long Arctic night
  The muskox knows the standard that flouts the Northern Light
  What is the Flag of England  Ye have but my bergs to dare
  Ye have but my drifts to conquer  Go forth for it is there

  The South Wind sighedFrom the Virgins my midsea course was taen
  Over a thousand islands lost in an idle main
  Where the seaegg flames on the coral and the longbacked breakers croon
  Their endless ocean legends to the lazy locked lagoon

  Strayed amid lonely islets mazed amid outer keys
  I waked the palms to laughterI tossed the scud in the breeze
  Never was isle so little never was sea so lone
  But over the scud and the palmtrees an English flag was flown

  I have wrenched it free from the halliard to hang for a wisp on the Horn
  I have chased it north to the Lizardribboned and rolled and torn
  I have spread its fold oer the dying adrift in a hopeless sea
  I have hurled it swift on the slaver and seen the slave set free

  My basking sunfish know it and wheeling albatross
  Where the lone wave fills with fire beneath the Southern Cross
  What is the Flag of England  Ye have but my reefs to dare
  Ye have but my seas to furrow  Go forth for it is there

  The East Wind roaredFrom the Kuriles the Bitter Seas I come
  And me men call the HomeWind for I bring the English home
  Looklook well to your shipping  By the breath of my mad typhoon
  I swept your closepacked Praya and beached your best at Kowloon

  The reeling junks behind me and the racing seas before
  I raped your richest roadsteadI plundered Singapore
  I set my hand on the Hoogli as a hooded snake she rose
  And I flung your stoutest steamers to roost with the startled crows

  Never the lotus closes never the wildfowl wake
  But a soul goes out on the East Wind that died for Englands sake
  Man or woman or suckling mother or bride or maid
  Because on the bones of the English the English Flag is stayed

  The desertdust hath dimmed it the flying wildass knows
  The scared white leopard winds it across the taintless snows
  What is the Flag of England  Ye have but my sun to dare
  Ye have but my sands to travel  Go forth for it is there

  The West Wind calledIn squadrons the thoughtless galleons fly
  That bear the wheat and cattle lest streetbred people die
  They make my might their porter they make my house their path
  Till I loose my neck from their rudder and whelm them all in my wrath

  I draw the gliding fogbank as a snake is drawn from the hole
  They bellow one to the other the frighted shipbells toll
  For day is a drifting terror till I raise the shroud with my breath
  And they see strange bows above them and the two go locked to death

  But whether in calm or wrackwreath whether by dark or day
  I heave them whole to the conger or rip their plates away
  First of the scattered legions under a shrieking sky
  Dipping between the rollers the English Flag goes by

  The dead dumb fog hath wrapped itthe frozen dews have kissed
  The naked stars have seen it a fellowstar in the mist
  What is the Flag of England  Ye have but my breath to dare
  Ye have but my waves to conquer  Go forth for it is there




  CLEARED

  In Memory of a Commission

  Help for a patriot distressed a spotless spirit hurt
  Help for an honorable clan sore trampled in the dirt
  From Queenstown Bay to Donegal O listen to my song
  The honorable gentlemen have suffered grievous wrong

  Their noble names were mentionedO the burning black disgrace
  By a brutal Saxon paper in an Irish shootingcase
  They sat upon it for a year then steeled their heart to brave it
  And coruscating innocence the learned Judges gave it

  Bear witness Heaven of that grim crime beneath the surgeons knife
  The honorable gentlemen deplored the loss of life
  Bear witness of those chanting choirs that burk and shirk and snigger
  No man laid hand upon the knife or finger to the trigger

  Cleared in the face of all mankind beneath the winking skies
  Like phoenixes from Phoenix Park and what lay there they rise
  Go shout it to the emerald seasgive word to Erin now
  Her honorable gentlemen are clearedand this is how

  They only paid the Moonlighter his cattlehocking price
  They only helped the murderer with councils best advice
  Butsure it keeps their honor whitethe learned Court believes
  They never gave a piece of plate to murderers and thieves

  They ever told the ramping crowd to card a womans hide
  They never marked a man for deathwhat fault of theirs he died
  They only said intimidate and talked and went away
  By God the boys that did the work were braver men than they

  Their sin it was that fed the firesmall blame to them that heard
  The bhoys get drunk on rhetoric and madden at the word
  They knew whom they were talking at if they were Irish too
  The gentlemen that lied in Court they knew and well they knew

  They only took the Judasgold from Fenians out of jail
  They only fawned for dollars on the blooddyed ClannaGael
  If black is black or white is white ill black and white its down
  Theyre only traitors to the Queen and rebels to the Crown

  Cleared honorable gentlemen  Be thankful its no more
  The widows curse is on your house the dead are at your door
  On you the shame of open shame on you from North to South
  The band of every honest man flatheeled across your mouth

  Less black than we were paintedFaith no word of black was said
  The lightest touch was human blood and that ye know runs red
  Its sticking to your fist today for all your sneer and scoff
  And by the Judges wellweighed word you cannot wipe it off

  Hold up those hands of innocencego scare your sheep together
  The blundering tripping tups that bleat behind the old bellwether
  And if they snuff the taint and break to find another pen
  Tell them its tar that glistens so and daub them yours again

  The charge is oldAs old as Cainas fresh as yesterday
  Old as the Ten Commandments have ye talked those laws away
  If words are words or death is death or powder sends the ball
  You spoke the words that sped the shotthe curse be on you all

  Our friends believe Of course they doas sheltered women may
  But have they seen the shrieking soul ripped from the quivering clay
  TheyIf their own front door is shut theyll swear the whole worlds warm
  What do they know of dread of death or hanging fear of harm

  The secret half a country keeps the whisper in the lane
  The shriek that tells the shot went home behind the broken pane
  The dry blood crisping in the sun that scares the honest bees
  And shows the bhoys have heard your talkwhat do they know of these

  But youyou knoway ten times more the secrets of the dead
  Black terror on the countryside by word and whisper bred
  The mangled stallions scream at night the tailcropped heifers low
  Who set the whisper going first You know and well you know

  My soul  Id sooner lie in jail for murder plain and straight
  Pure crime Id done with my own hand for money lust or hate
  Than take a seat in Parliament by fellowfelons cheered
  While one of those not provens proved me cleared as you are cleared

  Clearedyou that lost the League accountsgo guard our honor still
  Go help to make our countrys laws that broke Gods laws at will
  One hand stuck out behind the back to signal strike again
  The other on your dressshirt front to show your heart is dane

  If black is black or white is white in black and white its down
  Youre only traitors to the Queen and but rebels to the Crown
  If print is print or words are words the learned Court perpends
  We are not ruled by murderers onlyby their friends




AN IMPERIAL RESCRIPT

  Now this is the tale of the Council the German Kaiser decreed
  To ease the strong of their burden to help the weak in their need
  He sent a word to the peoples who struggle and pant and sweat
  That the straw might be counted fairly and the tally of bricks be set

  The Lords of Their Hands assembled from the East and the West they drew
  Baltimore Lille and Essen Brummagem Clyde and Crewe
  And some were black from the furnace and some were brown from the soil
  And some were blue from the dyevat but all were wearied of toil

  And the young King saidI have found it the road to the rest ye seek
  The strong shall wait for the weary the hale shall halt for the weak
  With the even tramp of an army where no man breaks from the line
  Ye shall march to peace and plenty in the bond of brotherhoodsign

  The paper lay on the table the strong heads bowed thereby
  And a wail went up from the peoplesAy signgive rest for we die
   A hand was stretched to the goosequill a fist was cramped to scrawl
  Whenthe laugh of a blueeyed maiden ran clear through the councilhall

  And each one heard Her laughing as each one saw Her plain
  Saidie Mimi or Olga Gretchen or Mary Jane
  And the Spirit of Man that is in Him to the light of the vision woke
  And the men drew back from the paper as a Yankee delegate spoke

  Theres a girl in Jersey City who works on the telephone
  Were going to hitch our horses and dig for a house of our own
  With gas and water connections and steamheat through to the top
  And W Hohenzollern I guess I shall work till I drop

  And an English delegate thunderedThe weak an the lame be blowed
  Ive a berth in the SouWest workshops a home in the Wandsworth Road
  And till the sociation has footed my buryin bill
  I work for the kids an the missus  Pull up  I be damned if I will

  And over the German benches the bearded whisper ran
  Lager der girls und der dollars dey makes or dey breaks a man
  If Schmitt haf collared der dollars he collars der girl deremit
  But if Schmitt bust in der pizness we collars der girl from Schmitt

  They passed one resolutionYour subcommittee believe
  You can lighten the curse of Adam when youve lightened the curse of Eve
  But till we are built like angels with hammer and chisel and pen
  We will work for ourself and a woman for ever and ever amen

  Now this is the tale of the Council the German Kaiser held
  The day that they razored the Grindstone the day that the Cat was belled
  The day of the Figs from Thistles the day of the Twisted Sands
  The day that the laugh of a maiden made light of the Lords of Their Hands




TOMLINSON

  Now Tomlinson gave up the ghost in his house in Berkeley Square
  And a Spirit came to his bedside and gripped him by the hair
  A Spirit gripped him by the hair and carried him far away
  Till he heard as the roar of a rainfed ford the roar of the Milky Way
  Till he heard the roar of the Milky Way die down and drone and cease
  And they came to the Gate within the Wall where Peter holds the keys

  Stand up stand up now Tomlinson and answer loud and high
  The good that ye did for the sake of men or ever ye came to die
  The good that ye did for the sake of men in little earth so lone
   And the naked soul of Tomlinson grew white as a rainwashed bone

  O I have a friend on earth he said that was my priest and guide
  And well would he answer all for me if he were by my side
   For that ye strove in neighbourlove it shall be written fair
  But now ye wait at Heavens Gate and not in Berkeley Square
  Though we called your friend from his bed this night he could not speak
  for you
  For the race is run by one and one and never by two and two
   Then Tomlinson looked up and down and little gain was there
  For the naked stars grinned overhead and he saw that his soul was bare
  The Wind that blows between the worlds it cut him like a knife
  And Tomlinson took up his tale and spoke of his good in life

  This I have read in a book he said and that was told to me
  And this I have thought that another man thought of a Prince in Muscovy
   The good souls flocked like homing doves and bade him clear the path
  And Peter twirled the jangling keys in weariness and wrath

  Ye have read ye have heard ye have thought he said and the tale is
  yet to run
  By the worth of the body that once ye had give answerwhat haye done
   Then Tomlinson looked back and forth and little good it bore
  For the Darkness stayed at his shoulderblade and Heavens Gate before
  O this I have felt and this I have guessed and this I have heard men say
  And this they wrote that another man wrote of a carl in Norroway
   Ye have read ye have felt ye have guessed good lack Ye have hampered
  Heavens Gate
  Theres little room between the stars in idleness to prate
  O none may reach by hired speech of neighbour priest and kin
  Through borrowed deed to Gods good meed that lies so fair within
  Get hence get hence to the Lord of Wrong for doom has yet to run
  Andthe faith that ye share with Berkeley Square uphold you Tomlinson

              

  The Spirit gripped him by the hair and sun by sun they fell
  Till they came to the belt of Naughty Stars that rim the mouth of Hell
  The first are red with pride and wrath the next are white with pain
  But the third are black with clinkered sin that cannot burn again
  They may hold their path they may leave their path with never a soul to
  mark
  They may burn or freeze but they must not cease in the Scorn of the Outer
  Dark

  The Wind that blows between the worlds it nipped him to the bone
  And he yearned to the flare of HellGate there as the light of his own
  hearthstone

  The Devil he sat behind the bars where the desperate legions drew
  But he caught the hasting Tomlinson and would not let him through

  Wot ye the price of good pitcoal that I must pay said he
  That ye rank yoursel so fit for Hell and ask no leave of me
  I am all oersib to Adams breed that ye should give me scorn
  For I strove with God for your First Father the day that he was born

  Sit down sit down upon the slag and answer loud and high
  The harm that ye did to the Sons of Men or ever you came to die
   And Tomlinson looked up and up and saw against the night
  The belly of a tortured star bloodred in HellMouth light
  And Tomlinson looked down and down and saw beneath his feet
  The frontlet of a tortured star milkwhite in HellMouth heat

  O I had a love on earth said he that kissed me to my fall
  And if ye would call my love to me I know she would answer all
   All that ye did in love forbid it shall be written fair
  But now ye wait at HellMouth Gate and not in Berkeley Square
  Though we whistled your love from her bed tonight I trow she would not run
  For the sin ye do by two and two ye must pay for one by one
   The Wind that blows between the worlds it cut him like a knife
  And Tomlinson took up the tale and spoke of his sin in life
  Once I ha laughed at the power of Love and twice at the grip of the Grave
  And thrice I ha patted my God on the head that men might call me brave
   The Devil he blew on a brandered soul and set it aside to cool
  Do ye think I would waste my good pitcoal on the hide of a brainsick fool
  I see no worth in the hobnailed mirth or the jolthead jest ye did
  That I should waken my gentlemen that are sleeping three on a grid
   Then Tomlinson looked back and forth and there was little grace
  For HellGate filled the houseless Soul with the Fear of Naked Space

  Nay this I ha heard quo  Tomlinson and this was noised abroad
  And this I ha got from a Belgian book on the word of a dead French lord
   Ye ha heard ye ha read ye ha got good lack and the tale begins
  afresh
  Have ye sinned one sin for the pride o the eye or the sinful lust of the
  flesh
   Then Tomlinson he gripped the bars and yammered Let me in
  For I mind that I borrowed my neighbours wife to sin the deadly sin
   The Devil he grinned behind the bars and banked the fires high
  Did ye read of that sin in a book said he and Tomlinson said Ay
   The Devil he blew upon his nails and the little devils ran
  And he said Go husk this whimpering thief that comes in the guise of a man
  Winnow him out twixt star and star and sieve his proper worth
  Theres sore decline in Adams line if this be spawn of earth

  Empusas crew so nakednew they may not face the fire
  But weep that they bin too small to sin to the height of their desire
  Over the coal they chased the Soul and racked it all abroad
  As children rifle a caddiscase or the ravens foolish hoard

  And back they came with the tattered Thing as children after play
  And they said  The soul that he got from God he has bartered clean away

  We have threshed a stook of print and book and winnowed a chattering wind
  And many a soul wherefrom he stole but his we cannot find
  We have handled him we have dandled him we have seared him to the bone
  And sure if tooth and nail show truth he has no soul of his own
   The Devil he bowed his head on his breast and rumbled deep and low
  Im all oersib to Adams breed that I should bid him go

  Yet close we lie and deep we lie and if I gave him place
  My gentlemen that are so proud would flout me to my face
  Theyd call my house a common stews and me a careless host
  AndI would not anger my gentlemen for the sake of a shiftless ghost
   The Devil he looked at the mangled Soul that prayed to feel the flame
  And he thought of Holy Charity but he thought of his own good name
  Now ye could haste my coal to waste and sit ye down to fry
  Did ye think of that theft for yourself said he and Tomlinson said Ay
   The Devil he blew an outward breath for his heart was free from care
  Ye have scarce the soul of a louse he said but the roots of sin are
  there
  And for that sin should ye come in were I the lord alone
  But sinful pride has rule insideand mightier than my own

  Honour and Wit foredamned they sit to each his priest and whore
  Nay scarce I dare myself go there and you theyd torture sore

  Ye are neither spirit nor spirk he said
       ye are neither book nor brute
  Go get ye back to the flesh again for the sake of Mans repute

  Im all oersib to Adams breed that I should mock your pain
  But look that ye win to worthier sin ere ye come back again
  Get hence the hearse is at your doorthe grim black stallions wait
  They bear your clay to place today  Speed lest ye come too late
  Go back to Earth with a lip unsealedgo back with an open eye
  And carry my word to the Sons of Men or ever ye come to die
  That the sin they do by two and two they must pay for one by one
  Andthe God that you took from a printed book be with you Tomlinson

TOMMY

  I went into a publicouse to get a pint o beer
  The publican e up an sez We serve no redcoats here
   The girls beind the bar they laughed an giggled fit to die
  I outs into the street again an to myself sez I
      O its Tommy this an Tommy that an Tommy go away
      But its Thank you Mister Atkins when the band begins to play
      The band begins to play my boys the band begins to play
      O its Thank you Mister Atkins when the band begins to play

  I went into a theatre as sober as could be
  They gave a drunk civilian room but adnt none for me
  They sent me to the gallery or round the musicalls
  But when it comes to fightin Lord theyll shove me in the stalls
      For its Tommy this an Tommy that an Tommy wait outside
      But its Special train for Atkins when the troopers on the tide
      The troopships on the tide my boys the troopships on the tide
      O its Special train for Atkins when the troopers on the tide

  Yes makin mock o uniforms that guard you while you sleep
  Is cheaper than them uniforms an theyre starvation cheap
  An hustlin drunken soldiers when theyre goin large a bit
  Is five times better business than paradin in full kit

      Then its Tommy this an Tommy that an Tommy ows yer soul
       But its Thin red line of eroes when the drums begin to roll
      The drums begin to roll my boys the drums begin to roll

       But its Saviour of is country when the guns begin to shoot
      An its Tommy this an Tommy that an anything you please
      An Tommy aint a bloomin foolyou bet that Tommy sees

GUNGA DIN

  You may talk o gin and beer
  When youre quartered safe out ere
  An youre sent to pennyfights an Aldershot it
  But when it comes to slaughter
  You will do your work on water
  An youll lick the bloomin boots of im thats got it

  Now in Injias sunny clime
  Where I used to spend my time
  Aservin of Er Majesty the Queen
  Of all them blackfaced crew
  The finest man I knew

        Hi slippy hitherao

  The uniform e wore
  Was nothin much before
  An rather less than arf o that beind
  For a piece o twisty rag
  An a goatskin waterbag
  Was all the fieldequipment e could find

  When the sweatin trooptrain lay
  In a sidin through the day
  Where the eat would make your bloomin eyebrows crawl
  We shouted Harry By 
  Till our throats were brickydry
  Then we wopped im cause e couldnt serve us all

        It was Din Din Din
    You eathen where the mischief ave you been
        You put some juldee  in it
        Or Ill marrow  you this minute
    If you dont fill up my helmet Gunga Din

  E would dot an carry one
  Till the longest day was done
  An e didnt seem to know the use o fear

  If we charged or broke or cut
  You could bet your bloomin nut
  Ed be waitin fifty paces right flank rear
  With is mussick  on is back
  E would skip with our attack
  An watch us till the bugles made Retire
  An for all is dirty ide
  E was white clear white inside
  When e went to tend the wounded under fire
        It was Din Din Din
     With the bullets kickin dustspots on the green

        When the cartridges ran out
        You could hear the frontfiles shout
    Hi ammunitionmules an Gunga Din

  I shant forgit the night
  When I dropped beind the fight
  With a bullet where my beltplate should a been
  I was chokin mad with thirst
  An the man that spied me first
  Was our good old grinnin gruntin Gunga Din
  E lifted up my ead
  An he plugged me where I bled
  An e guv me arfapint o watergreen
  It was crawlin and it stunk
  But of all the drinks Ive drunk
  Im gratefullest to one from Gunga Din

        It was Din Din Din
    Eres a beggar with a bullet through is spleen
        Es chawin up the ground
        An es kickin all around
    For Gawds sake git the water Gunga Din

  To where a dooli lay
  An a bullet come an drilled the beggar clean
  E put me safe inside
  An just before e died
  I ope you liked your drink sez Gunga Din
  So Ill meet im later on
  At the place where e is gone
  Where its always double drill and no canteen
  Ell be squattin on the coals
  Givin drink to poor damned souls
  An Ill get a swig in hell from Gunga Din
        Yes Din Din Din
    You Lazarushianleather Gunga Din
        Though Ive belted you and flayed you
        By the livin Gawd that made you
    Youre a better man than I am Gunga Din

OONTS

  Northern India Transport Train

  Wot makes the soldiers eart to penk wot makes im to perspire
  It isnt standin up to charge nor lyin down to fire
  But its everlastin waitin on a everlastin road
  For the commissariat camel an is commissariat load
      O the oont  O the oont O the commissariat oont
       With is silly neck abobbin like a basket full o snakes
      We packs im like an idol an you ought to ear im grunt
       An when we gets im loaded up is blessed girthrope breaks

  Wot makes the rearguard swear so ard when night is drorin in
  An every native follower is shiverin for is skin
  It aint the chanst o being rushed by Paythans from the ills
  Its the commissariat camel puttin on is bloomin frills
      O the oont O the oont O the hairy scary oont
       Atrippin over tentropes when weve got the night alarm
      We socks im with a stretcherpole an eads im off in front
       An when weve saved is bloomin life e chaws our bloomin arm

  The orse e knows above a bit the bullocks but a fool
  The elephants a gentleman the batterymules a mule
  But the commissariat camuel when all is said an done
  Es a devil an a ostrich an a orphanchild in one
      O the oont O the oont O the Gawdforsaken oont
       The lumpyumpy umminbird asingin where e lies
      Es blocked the whole division from the rearguard to the front
       An when we get him up againthe beggar goes an dies

  Ell gall an chafe an lame an fighte smells most awful vile
  Ell lose isself for ever if you let im stray a mile
  Es game to graze the ole day long an owl the ole night through
  An when e comes to greasy ground e splits isself in two
      O the oont O the oont O the floppin droppin oont
       When is long legs give from under an is meltin eye is dim
      The tribes is up beind us and the tribes is out in front
       It aint no jam for Tommy but its kites an crows for im

  So when the cruel march is done an when the roads is blind
  An when we sees the camp in front an ears the shots beind
  Ho then we strips is saddle off and all is woes is past
  E thinks on us that used im so and gets revenge at last
      O the oont O the oont O the floatin bloatin oont
       The late lamented camel in the watercut e lies
      We keeps a mile beind im an we keeps a mile in front
       But e gets into the drinkincasks and then o course we dies

  Cameloo is pronounced like u in bull but by Mr Atkins to
  rhyme with front




LOOT

  If youve ever stole a pheasantegg beind the keepers back
   If youve ever snigged the washin from the line
  If youve ever crammed a gander in your bloomin aversack
   You will understand this little song o mine

  But the service rules are ard an from such we are debarred
   For the same with English morals does not suit

      Cornet  Toot toot
  Wy they call a man a robber if e stuffs is marchin clobber
   With the
  Chorus  Loo loo  Lulu lulu  Loo loo  Loot loot loot
                 Ow the loot
                 Bloomin loot
              Thats the thing to make the boys git up an shoot
               Its the same with dogs an men
               If youd make em come again
              Clap em forward with a Loo loo Lulu Loot
      ff  Whoopee  Tear im puppy  Loo loo Lulu  Loot loot loot

  If youve knocked a nigger edgeways when es thrustin for your life
   You must leave im very careful where e fell
  An may thank your stars an gaiters if you didnt feel is knife
   That you aint told off to bury im as well

  Then the sweatin Tommies wonder as they spade the beggars under
   Why lootin should be entered as a crime
  So if my song youll ear I will learn you plain an clear
   Ow to pay yourself for fightin overtime

  Chorus  With the loot

  Now remember when youre acking round a gilded Burma god
   That is eyes is very often precious stones
  An if you treat a nigger to a dose o cleaninrod
   Es like to show you everything e owns

  When e wont prodooce no more pour some water on the floor
   Where you ear it answer ollow to the boot
      Cornet  Toot toot
  When the ground begins to sink shove your baynick down the chink
   An youre sure to touch the
  Chorus  Loo loo  Lulu   Loot loot loot
                 Ow the loot

  When from ouse to ouse youre unting you must always work in pairs
   It alves the gain but safer you will find
  For a single man gets bottled on them twistywisty stairs
   An a woman comes and clobs im from beind

  When youve turned em inside out an it seems beyond a doubt
   As if there werent enough to dust a flute
      Cornet  Toot toot
  Before you sling your ook at the ousetops take a look
   For its underneath the tiles they ide the loot

  Chorus  Ow the loot

SNARLEYOW

  This appened in a battle to a battry of the corps
  Which is first among the women an amazin first in war
  An what the bloomin battle was I dont remember now
  But Twos offlead e answered to the name o Snarleyow

      Down in the Infantry nobody cares
      Down in the Cavalry Colonel e swears
      But down in the lead with the wheel at the flog
      Turns the bold Bombardier to a little whipped dog

  They was movin into action they was needed very sore
  To learn a little schoolin to a native army corps
  They ad nipped against an uphill they was tuckin down the brow
  When a tricky trundlin roundshot give the knock to Snarleyow

  They cut im loose an left ime was almost tore in two
  But he tried to follow after as a welltrained orse should do
  E went an fouled the limber an the Drivers Brother squeals
  Pull up pull up for Snarleyowis heads between is eels

  The Driver umped is shoulder for the wheels was goin round
  An there aint no Stop conductor when a battrys changin ground
  Sez e  I broke the beggar in an very sad I feels
  But I couldnt pull up not for youyour ead between your eels

  E adnt ardly spoke the word before a droppin shell
  A little right the battry an between the sections fell
  An when the smoke ad cleared away before the limber wheels
  There lay the Drivers Brother with is ead between is eels

  Then sez the Drivers Brother an is words was very plain
  For Gawds own sake get over me an put me out o pain
   They saw is wounds was mortial an they judged that it was best
  So they took an drove the limber straight across is back an chest

  The Driver e give nothin cept a little coughin grunt
  But e swung is orses andsome when it came to Action Front
   An if one wheel was juicy you may lay your Monday head
  Twas juicier for the niggers when the case begun to spread

  The moril of this story it is plainly to be seen
  You avnt got no families when servin of the Queen
  You avnt got no brothers fathers sisters wives or sons
  If you want to win your battles take an work your bloomin guns

      Down in the Infantry nobody cares
      Down in the Cavalry Colonel e swears
      But down in the lead with the wheel at the flog
      Turns the bold Bombardier to a little whipped dog

THE YOUNG BRITISH SOLDIER

  When the arfmade recruity goes out to the East
  E acts like a babe an e drinks like a beast
  An e wonders because e is frequent deceased
     Ere es fit for to serve as a soldier

        Serve serve serve as a soldier
        Serve serve serve as a soldier
        Serve serve serve as a soldier
           Sooldier of the Queen

  Now all you recruities whats drafted today
  You shut up your ragbox an ark to my lay
  An Ill sing you a soldier as far as I may
     A soldier whats fit for a soldier

        Fit fit fit for a soldier

  First mind you steer clear o the grogsellers huts
  For they sell you Fixed Baynets that rots out your guts
  Ay drink that ud eat the live steel from your butts
     An its bad for the young British soldier

        Bad bad bad for the soldier

  When the cholera comesas it will past a doubt
  Keep out of the wet and dont go on the shout
  For the sickness gets in as the liquor dies out
     An it crumples the young British soldier

        Crum crum crumples the soldier

  But the worst o your foes is the sun overead
  You must wear your elmet for all that is said
  If e finds you uncovered ell knock you down dead
     An youll die like a fool of a soldier

        Fool fool fool of a soldier

  If youre cast for fatigue by a sergeant unkind
  Dont grouse like a woman nor crack on nor blind
  Be handy and civil and then you will find
     That its beer for the young British soldier

        Beer beer beer for the soldier

  Now if you must marry take care she is old
  A troopsergeants widows the nicest Im told
  For beauty wont help if your rations is cold
     Nor love aint enough for a soldier

        Nough nough nough for a soldier

  If the wife should go wrong with a comrade be loath
  To shoot when you catch emyoull swing on my oath
  Make im take er and keep er  thats Hell for them both
     An youre shut o the curse of a soldier

        Curse curse curse of a soldier

  When first under fire an youre wishful to duck
  Dont look nor take eed at the man that is struck
  Be thankful youre livin and trust to your luck
     And march to your front like a soldier

        Front front front like a soldier

  When arf of your bullets fly wide in the ditch
  Dont call your Martini a crosseyed old bitch
  Shes human as you areyou treat her as sich
     An shell fight for the young British soldier

        Fight fight fight for the soldier

  When shakin their bustles like ladies so fine
  The guns o the enemy wheel into line
  Shoot low at the limbers an dont mind the shine
     For noise never startles the soldier

        Start start startles the soldier

  If your officers dead and the sergeants look white
  Remember its ruin to run from a fight
  So take open order lie down and sit tight
     And wait for supports like a soldier

        Wait wait wait like a soldier

  When youre wounded and left on Afghanistans plains
  And the women come out to cut up what remains
  Jest roll to your rifle and blow out your brains
     An go to your Gawd like a soldier

        Go go go like a soldier
        Go go go like a soldier
        Go go go like a soldier
           Sooldier of the Queen




MANDALAY

  By the old Moulmein Pagoda lookin lazy at the sea
  Theres a Burma girl asettin and I know she thinks o me
  For the wind is in the palmtrees and the templebells they say
  Come you back you British soldier come you back to Mandalay
       Come you back to Mandalay
      Where the old Flotilla lay
      Cant you ear their paddles chunkin from Rangoon to Mandalay
      On the road to Mandalay
      Where the flyinfishes play
      An the dawn comes up like thunder outer China crost the Bay

  Er petticoat was yaller an er little cap was green
  An er name was Supiyawlatjes the same as Theebaws Queen
  An I seed her first asmokin of a whackin white cheroot
  An awastin Christian kisses on an eathen idols foot
      Bloomin idol made omud
      Wot they called the Great Gawd Budd
      Plucky lot she cared for idols when I kissed er where she stud
      On the road to Mandalay

  When the mist was on the ricefields an the sun was droppin slow
  Shed git er little banjo an shed sing Kullalolo
   With er arm upon my shoulder an er cheek agin my cheek
  We useter watch the steamers an the hathis pilin teak
      Elephints apilin teak
      In the sludgy squdgy creek
      Where the silence ung that eavy you was arf afraid to speak
      On the road to Mandalay

  But thats all shove beind melong ago an fur away
  An there aint no busses runnin from the Bank to Mandalay
  An Im learnin ere in London what the tenyear soldier tells
  If youve eard the East acallin you wont never eed naught else
       No you wont eed nothin else
      But them spicy garlic smells
      An the sunshine an the palmtrees an the tinkly templebells
      On the road to Mandalay

  I am sick o wastin leather on these gritty pavinstones
  An the blasted Henglish drizzle wakes the fever in my bones
  Tho I walks with fifty ousemaids outer Chelsea to the Strand
  An they talks a lot o lovin but wot do they understand
      Beefy face an grubby and
      Law wot do they understand
      Ive a neater sweeter maiden in a cleaner greener land
      On the road to Mandalay

  Ship me somewheres east of Suez where the best is like the worst
  Where there arent no Ten Commandments an a man can raise a thirst
  For the templebells are callin an its there that I would be
  By the old Moulmein Pagoda looking lazy at the sea
      On the road to Mandalay
      Where the old Flotilla lay
      With our sick beneath the awnings when we went to Mandalay
      On the road to Mandalay
      Where the flyinfishes play
      An the dawn comes up like thunder outer China crost the Bay

  Were marchin on relief over Injias sunny plains
  A little front o Christmastime an just beind the Rains
  Ho get away you bullockman youve eard the bugle blowed

      And the road asliding past

      Kiko kissywarsti dont you hamsher argy jow 

  Oh theres them Injian temples to admire when you see
  Theres the peacock round the corner an the monkey up the tree
  An theres that rummy silver grass awavin in the wind
  An the old Grand Trunk atrailin like a riflesling beind

      While its best foot first

  At halfpast fives Revelly an our tents they down must come
  Like a lot of button mushrooms when you pick em up at ome
  But its over in a minute an at six the column starts
  While the women and the kiddies sit an shiver in the carts

      An its best foot first

  Oh then its open order an we lights our pipes an sings
  An we talks about our rations an a lot of other things
  An we thinks o friends in England an we wonders what theyre at
  An ow they would admire for to hear us sling the bat

      An its best foot first

  Its none so bad o Sunday when youre lyin at your ease
  To watch the kites awheelin round them feathereaded trees
  For although there aint no women yet there aint no barrickyards
  So the orficers goes shootin an the men they plays at cards

      Till its best foot first

  So ark an eed you rookies which is always grumblin sore
  Theres worser things than marchin from Umballa to Cawnpore

  Orientalist and a fluent speaker of Hindustani  As a matter of fact
  he depends largely on the signlanguage
