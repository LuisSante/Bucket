                     THE  PRIZE WINNING STORY
                in IFs College Science Fiction Contest

Here is the best story submitted in answer to the theme question
What Will Life in America Be Like  Years From Now  Written by
an undergraduate at the University of Louisville Louisville Kentucky
it pictures the America of  as part of a world empire run by an
Italian dictator and very similar to that of the ancient Caesars and
the early Roman Empire There is one language one religion and customs
and laws have changed to suit the times But basically human nature
hasnt changed and there is the omnipresent clash of faction against
faction The theme is that a dictatorship is the only perfect form of
government If there is a moral it is that there is no permanent form
of government

He sat down suddenly He stared up at the man

Say it again he muttered

He knew what the answer would be even before the man repeated it in
that quiet voice

This is June  

The fellow wasnt kidding him He was serious enough But a couple
of minutes ago it had been May   He looked at his watch and
grunted Less than four minutes ago it had been  Reality Now it
was June   There were four steel walls There was a steel chair
There were no windows

He tried to take it calmly But the unbelievable horror of being
where he was and when he was and the man calmly repeating This
is June   screamed for release

No No Youre lying Its impossible He grabbed the mans tunic and
drew back a doubled fist His chair went over behind him

Then a stiff thumb jabbed him in the short ribs and he grunted and went
down

This is June   You are still in Louisville Kentucky You are
standing in a room adjoining the laboratory in the Time Building on
rd Street at Eastern Parkway This is the receiving room My name is
Kevin Ilaria Youve come through time Is that so impossible to grasp
Youre a thinking man Educated

He looked up from the floor

Well

So Im a thinking man and an educated man And what happens Im
sapped Im shanghaied Im walking down Confederate Place to my old
fraternity house at  in the morning Ive just had a row with
my girl Im heading for the fraternity house to see wholl go down
to Hermans and get good and drunk with me And somebody clobbers
me The next thing I remember Im sitting in a steel chair in a
steel room without any windows Just like this one Theres a man
standing there A man with watery myopic eyes under bushy brows and
his hair parted in the middle Hes Doctor Borley of the University
of Louisville Chemistry Department Theres another man with him A
little fellow with thick glasses and a crew cut and eyes like the slits
between closed Venetian blinds Hes Doctor Schink of the Psychology
Department Theyre talking about me

Umn hmn Now youre beginning to sound normal Doctors Borley and
Schink are our agents in  Do you know where you were

I told you In some sort of steel room without win

The man made an impatient gesture with his hand No I mean where
You were in a steel chamber in the Daynolds Metals Plant It stood on
this spot in  Two people knewknowabout that room

Doctor Borley and Doctor Schink

Im glad youve calmed down Now we can talk

Jay wasnt quite ready to calm down You stand there in that Roman
outfit and talk about being calm To me To me Jay Welch a history
major who took his AB from the University of Louisville in  Jay
Welch average guy who got into an average argument with the girl he
pinned in  and went for a walk to drown his sorrows and wound up
one hundred years from wherewhenhe started I

Then you admit youve come through Time

I may as well

Ilaria cursed quietly But youre not an average guy You have a
working knowledge of chemistry and biology and physics and history
and a few arts and sociology and psychology and geopolitics and
literature and the English language as spoken in AD  You hope to
be successful as a writer Youre Public Relations Consultant with
DuoPoint one of the biggest corporations in your nation in 

Yes Jay Welch said And I make good money Even better than a bus
driver or a steamfitter So

So here you are s representative to  Ilaria was only a
man He could not keep the flourish and the Hollywood grandeur out of
his voice

Yes And what happens tomorrow when I dont show up for work What
happens in a few days when people find out Ive disappeared What
happens when they find out Julie was the last person I was with What

Youre getting yourself worked up again Jay Welch Dont you think
we have thought of those things Weve brought you across one hundred
years Jay Welch

Yes Jay said quietly flatly Yes Then just as flatly just as
quietly he said Why

So youve remembered to wonder about that at last Ilaria smiled
Jay noticed that the smile was onesided and pulled back the left
corner of Ilarias mouth He stood there and looked down at Jay Welch
who had forgotten that he was sitting on the floor His tunic was
white and there were three diamondshaped silver pieces in a vertical
line on each elbowlength sleeve There was a wide blue stripe and a
narrow silver stripe at the hem of his tunic and at his sleeves He
wore sandals His belt was leather and there was a holstered pistol of
some sort hanging at his left hip In tiny blue script above his left
breast pocket were the words Trib Ilaria On the pocket was a red
disk with the letters PR A silverworked blue cloak was flung over
his shoulders Except for the identification and the odd fabric of his
clothes and the holstered gun he looked very like a young Roman of the
first century

Ilarias slow smile pulled back the left corner of his mouth Because
you are who you are and what you are Because you attended the
University of Louisville and Doctors Borley and Schink knew you
Because they chose you Merely because they chose you They mightve
chosen anyone else

Weve your personality pretty well mapped out We expected violence
Thats why Im here Im a psychologist and an anthropologist Im a
fasttalker and I can convince people and place them at ease Im also
big enough to handle you Jay Welch

From his position on the floor Jay looked up at Ilaria and decided the
man from  was big enough Jay Welch was six feet one inch tall He
weighed one seventythree and wore a long suit Kevin Ilaria was
bigger

Jay was forced to grin The tall blond man was a likeable guy at that
A human being

Who are you

Kevin Ilaria Doctor of Psychology That entitles me to the silver
band on my tunic Also a Tribune That entitles me to the blue stripe
and the three silver diamonds and the gun

A Tribune In what Of what

In the Forces In the actual ranks a Tribune commands  men 
planes or a base or  tanks But Ive never had a chance to go into
the field There has been no cause to fight Meantime Im stationed at
Standiford Field as secondincommand A friend of mine named Rinaldi
fills in for me Hes a SubTribune

Ive been specializing in the study of Time

The way you say Time it sounds as though it were capitalized Where I
come from Time with a capital T is a magazine

Kevin Ilaria laughed He reached down a hand Get up he said and
taking Jays forearm helped him to his feet

Lets go he said

Jay didnt bother to ask where they were going He followed the Tribune
out the door and into the hall On the wall just outside the door was
a black box Two squares cut into it shone with a faint white light
Ilaria paused and shielded the lighted areas a moment with his hand
and Jay saw the light go out in the room they had just left Ilaria
closed the door As he turned Jay saw the white letters PR emblazoned
on the back of his cloak

This way he said Jay noticed that Ilaria walked on his right so
that the Tribunes gun was between them

The way I said Time it is capitalized It means all the Time since
the beginning Its a corporation like your DuoPoint Only much
larger and much less known Our job is to learn

Thats a big order Jay commented You learn
byborrowingemissaries

Ilaria laughed again Thanks for the phraseology but it wouldnt
worry me if you called it kidnaping or shanghaiing Youre right
of course We learn by sending men from this age to other ones and by
pulling men from other ages to this one Doctor Schink is our Emissary
to  His real name is Clyde Gabrinaldi Borley is our contact
there  rather then

Well Ill be damned Ive gone to Clyde a lot of times for advice

The left corner of Ilarias mouth pulled back as his grin widened Umn
hmn Hes married too With a child Hes there for good

Jay was afraid to ask if emissaries from the past to  were there
for good too He changed the subject

You started to tell me before

Oh yes Im to be your teacher and companion But Ill try to give
you a quick fillin Our world of  is quite different from yours
And we hope in better shape Weve proved that the only way to
maintain world peace is by world government And the only successful
type of government is a dictatorship

Jay gasped You mean the entire worldhas reverted to dictatorship

Ilaria laughed Not reverted We finally accepted it as the only
logical form of government for an entire world

What happens when the dictator goes wild He always has

The smile was there again Youre not quite ready for that Ilaria
told him But it has been taken into consideration

Out of the corner of his eye Jay saw the slight puff of Ilarias
chest the selfsatisfied square of his shoulders the quick set of his
jaw He wondered what part Tribune Kevin Ilaria played in the dictator
control this world had provided

The system has worked and is working See this

They turned a corner in the corridor and faced a great domed room
On the far wall hung a white tapestry of something like  x  foot
dimensions On it emblazoned in letters of red and yellow made to look
like flame were the characters PPB In the lower righthand corner in
white outlined with blue was the same PR that Ilaria wore Jay waited
for the Tribunes explanation

PpB stands for Pax per Bello Ilaria explained Peace through War
That slogan was written in  by Julius and adapted in  as
official

Julius

Yes The first Dictator

Things were beginning to click in Jays mind

I think I know what PR stands for he said Pax Romana

As always Ilaria smiled Thats right he said

                                   

The commandcar marked with the PR symbol pulled over and stopped

What is it Who are you the driver demanded

The Captain on the seat beside him peered into the blackness and cursed

The man who had waved the vehicle to a halt walked away

Here the Captain cried What in blazes is going on here Whyd you
stop us Centurion Stop that man

The two Centurions in the back seat looked at the Captain for a moment
then they both jumped out and ran after the man

An ellipsoidal grey thing streaked out of the darkness landed in the
drivers lap and thudded to the floor of the car The Captain threw
open his door and started to climb out The driver bent over to see
what it was

At that moment the driver the commandcar and the Captain blew up

The silence that followed was broken by the blast of a submachine gun
as it struck down the two centurions

Take their weapons said a brittle voice

                                   

The detachment of soldiers from the garrison at Tel Aviv stopped and
looked around

Sir what is it asked a guard anxiously

Terribly quiet out here somethings up the Lieutenant muttered
calmly

There were seven of them The Lieutenant the Centurion and five
legionaries They had grown accustomed to the quiet life of garrison
men in a calm conquered city When there is nothing tangible to be
guarded a guards life is a dull one The guns they carried were
the symbol of their authority and had never been used for any other
purpose

They looked around The dirty oncewhite buildings rose close on
either side There was no moon There was no sound The darkness and
the silence could have been cut with a knife

The Lieutenant grinned He didnt feel much like grinning He spoke He
didnt feel much like talking either

This darkness is thick he said You could cut it with a knife Wish
I had a knife

He got a knife The men had just started to laugh when the Lieutenant
got it

Between his shoulder blades

As the Lieutenant toppled forward the Centurion dodged close against
the dirty stone wall and yelled Spread out

They killed a lot of the shadowy greenclad attackers but there were
only six of them and they were cornered When the enemy drove a tank
into the alley and sprayed them with its mounted gun they died

Take their weapons said a quiet voice

                                   

The halftrack rolled to a stop

Where Sir the driver wanted to know

Beyond that big crater over there The sun glinted on metal Im sure
of it Didnt you see it

No Sir The driver craned his neck There was nothing but barren
rubble and bomb craters and torn twisted metal and ruined buildings

There are all sorts of old automobiles lying around out there Sir
the driver volunteered

Yes and theyve been here long enough to get good and rusty the
Captain snapped This is something else

The driver craned his neck There was nothing but rubble

Eight men in the back of the halftrack leaped to their feet when they
heard the faint clicking of KCNHSO guns and the buzz of an old gamma
gun and the sharp bark of a very old sub machinegun But a grenade
landed on the truck and another rolled under it

Another wreck was added to the rubble

Take their weapons if there are any left said a quiet voice

                                   

And in the more peaceful city of Louisville Jay Welch was introduced
to Kevin Ilarias best friend his adjutant at Standiford Field

Jay took a liking to SubTribune Jason Rinaldi the moment he felt the
fellows firm grip

Jason is adjutant Ilaria explained And one of the few field
soldiers who manages to get along with Caesars Pretorian Prefect
Lamberti How he does it I dont know Lambertis absolutely
unbearable

Prejudice Middleclass prejudices Rinaldi grinned He was short and
very dark with a lot of black hair

Ilarias left cheek cracked into a long dimple as he smiled He picks
on me because Im a serious psychologist

Rinaldi laughed As a psychologist Kevin youre an excellent bridge
player As a soldier

Just remember whos got three bars and who has two

Rinaldi waved his hand and shrugged They pass em out to psych boys
wholesale he said and ducked Ilarias swing Slow reflexes too
he added as he turned to go

Ilaria stopped him at the door and murmured a few sentences

Jay caught something about sabotage at Standiford Rinaldi seemed to be
attributing it to the Commanding Officer there

Nice guy Jay said as the door closed behind Rinaldi

You said it Good officer too Hell root out the bird whos playing
around out there Cant figure out why its being done

Factions Jay said within factions

Little ones always exist I guess Have you finished with the history
films

Ive seen them yes Im still trying to digest them

The language give you much trouble

Quite a bit but I think I got most of it

One man Jay went on wonderingly One man A Captain in the Italian
Army

The Communist forces in IndoChina had been driven back and
Captainthen MajorLollabrigida went in after them

The defeat was becoming so terrible that the Kremlin dealt itself a
playing hand rather than the dummy it had been playing Red forces came
piling in Lollabrigida and his Italian troops stopped them cold Then
he seemed to sway And when the Commies pounced for the kill they
were trapped pocketed and annihilated

American newspapers and commentators began to call Major Julius
Lollabrigida Julius Caesar Italy became big overnight The Big Three
became Russia the United States and Italy Lollabrigida appealed to
Americasometime in there they made him a Colonel but he was actually
telling the Generals and the Italian government what to dofor aid in
going ahead aggressively

And America turned him down They were still playing wait and see
They waited They waited too long The Commies got tired of waiting
around and sent a couple of jet bombers with Abombs

Now youre telling me things Ilaria interrupted Im pretty shady
on that period myself

Jay shrugged It was after my time All I know is what the films show
Two planes each with a sevenman crew and each carrying one atomic
bomb were dispatched from an airbase somewhere near Juneau Jay
stopped

And

The man from  choked It was hard to be objective about this It
wasnt so easy for him to pass off as the film had done

And he hesitated

Its over Jay Its done with It doesnt even concern you anymore
It belongs to a past era

One was headed for New York The other struck farther inland  for
Washington The first one was shot down by an F border patrol
plane The other one got through Itit levelled the capitol Almost
completely The White House and the Pentagon were destroyed

Ilaria sat quietly and waited Jay didnt go on

Thus removing the United States of America as such from a prominent
position in the world picture Ilaria said

Yes I cant understand it Everything just folded up SAC
didnt even get off the ground And Colonel Lollabrigida by then
CommanderinChief of the UN forces sent fifty planes each with
one Abomb over the Kremlin One was shot down over Vladivostok
but the bombardier pulled the firing pin as the ship crashed and
most of Vladivostok was destroyed Six other planes made it to their
destinations and dropped their loads I cant remember the cities 
one was a new super airbase near Moscow Five of the planes returned
None had managed to reach Moscow Half the world was in ruins The Pope
begged that the War be stopped

Ilaria snorted He knew theyd hit Rome

Jay looked at him Is that what you think

Ilaria shrugged and flashed that quick winning smile There are no
other motives are there

Jay stared What changes had taken place in religious philosophy in
this hardbitten world of 

Kevin Ilaria shrugged smiling Thats unimportant Lets go on with
the history lesson Then what

Uhoh yes As I remember Julius Lollabrigida to be trite launched
an allout offensive against Communist forces everywhere People were
afraid of Russia but they were afraid of Lollabrigida and Rome too
So they joined him Aid poured into the UN Czechoslovakia was taken
and Poland and Hungary and finally only the old Russia of pre World War
II days was left And in they went

Then Lollabrigidas saboteurs exploded an atomic bomb in the heart of
Moscow After that it was pretty easy sledding

Astounding how a nation seems to fall apart when its capitol and its
leaders are gone Ilaria remarked

Everybody and everything folds Jay said Morale dies

After the demolition of Moscow and other parts of the USSR Italy
stood at the top General of the Armies Julius Lollabrigida marched
back into Italy and into Rome and into the capitol and up on a
pedestal He stood as Italys utter ruler His last name was lost and
replaced by Caesar II He was named Dictator

From mighty Rome Caesar sent out linguists and anthropologists and
ethnologists and psychologists and military men and others In twenty
years twenty peaceful years Italian had become the language of the
world A few minor uprisings in America and in Japan were smashed
Julius Caesar II was World Dictator of the Republic of Earth Someone
in America denied him and was torn to pieces by the people Someone
in Italy spread literature of dissension and was hunted down and
liquidated by Caesars personal police the Pretoriani And so it went

Caesar adopted a prominent Air Force Colonel who became Caesar III on
Lollabrigidas death Each year on his birthday men were silent No
business was transacted No one left his home Except blueandsilver
clad soldiers wearing PR armbands Caesars Pretorians No one dared
venture out

During the reign of Caesar III every person in the world changed his
last name to an Italian one The Ali bens and the Chicos and the Andres
and the Fritzes and the Johns became Marianos and Roccos and Caldinis
and Campisanos and diManos

There was silence for a moment

The thing I cant understand Jay mused is why in all these years
there hasnt been a bad Caesar or an uprising

What do you mean by bad Caesar

Jay shrugged In the first Pax Romana there was Caligula who was
insane Nero who preferred artistic diversions to politics There was
Galba who didnt know what was going on And so on And on and on
Your three dictators so far seem to have done excellent jobs They seem
to be damned conscientious leaders

When you recreate something Ilaria told him you try to eliminate
its faults

Of course But what if Caesars son or a Caesars adopted son goes
bad Jay elucidated

So far we havent had that problem to deal with But were ready Each
time a new Dictator comes to power one thousand top military men draw
folded pieces of plastipaper from a bowl On twenty of these are Xs
The others contain Os The twenty Xs are a secret organization sworn
to kill the Dictator if it should become necessary When Caesar as you
say goes bad

Brilliant Jay breathed And heCaesarnever knows who they are

No one ever knows Ilaria said Not even the members They remain
in contact but none ever knows who the others are

Jay remembered Ilarias previous mention of the system and the
unconscious swelling of the Tribunes chest at the time Youre one
he said

Ilaria was caught off guard Iyes he said I wont ask how you
knew

A guess Then youve been awhatever its calledfor nine years
during Caesar Vs reign

Thats right

And you dont know any of the others

Only one I found out accidentally He Ilaria stopped

Jay shrugged I wont ask any more questions along that line he
promised But I still cant believe there havent been any uprisings

None Caesar II died of a heart attack Caesar III had a brain tumor
which we learned about too late His son never had a chance to prove
himself other than that he was brave and foolish He swam the Rubicon
at its widest point then walked to Rome in his shorts in the dead of
winter He died of pneumonia Caesar V our Dictator today is strong
and quiet He holds the Empire firmly unified But he does nothing
extraordinary And he is too lenient

I just cant conceive of such perfection

Kevin Ilaria smiled He walked over to the window and peered out
You couldnt But this is the perfect government Everyone
is satisfied One ruler One capitol One army One language One
nationality One world One religion

I realize Jay halted One religion he demanded

Yes

What is it He found himself afraid of the answer The indications
were there in plain sight He guessed it before Kevin Ilaria turned
from the window and said

Caesarism

                                   

The man called Gaius Julius Caesar Imperator V turned from the window
and rubbed his hand over his graying hair

This is the first time Ive ever run into anything of this sort

The President of the Senate shrugged He was an old man who had been
placed in the Senate by his father in  So long ago that people
wondered when he would die They were tired of these old men dictating
to their ruler as many people before them had been tired The rise of
the President of the Senate to leadership of that revered group had not
been meteoric by any means But his maintenance of the position had
been tenacious He was a careful man

The President of the Senate shrugged It is It is the first time
anything of this sort has ever come up Julius Therefore it is up to
you to set an example

Caesar glanced over at General Bonadella The General nodded in
agreement with Senator Chianti

This sort of business can break up the Empire if its allowed to
continue Caesar he said in his pompous military way I say death

Major DeCosta nodded quietly

Thumbs down all around is it Caesar sat down behind his desk and
picked up the speaker of his private cable to London He looked at the
three men

Commander in charge of Garrison C he said

There was a silent moment

They looked up as Prefect Lamberti of the Pretorians the Imperial
personal bodyguard it had progressed far beyond that Its enrollment
was tremendous its power second only to the Dictators came in The
Senator nodded The two field soldiers turned quickly away The men of
the field did not get along with the Pretorian dandies

Commander This is the Dictator Caesar said unnecessarily The
garrison commander knew that only one person could call him on that
line The phone would react to no voice other than Caesars

Have you the fellow who was preaching dissension I say one year in
prison You heard me Yes one year What No No torture He severed
connections and looked up at his advisers

Prefect Lamberti shook his head Senator Chianti turned and stalked
out After a moment General Bonadella followed The Major turned away
to stare out the window He shook his head

del Ponta This is the Dictator that quiet flat voice said behind
him Caesar was calling the underchief of the Pretoriani I will
speak tomorrow from the balcony Yes  Of course Worldwide
Thats right Oh I suppose about a quarter til

The man who ruled the world stood up and stared at Major DeCostas
back At fortyone Caesar was a gaunt man with stooped shoulders and
sad lines running from his nostrils to the corners of his mouth His
forehead was lined and relined and the keen brown eyes were dulled
with years of decisions and hard work

He was tired

They called him the Hound because his face bore the same sad quiet
look worn by those dogs And they called him weak because he let
offenders off too easily

DeCosta turned around The young Major met his Chiefs gaze

Well The voice of the Dictator was quiet and calm

DeCostas eyes flickered He straightened militarily He shrugged

It is not for me to say Sir

A slow smile spread over those weary features And you Farouk

Lamberti stretched out his arm and balled his fist with the thumb
extended and pointing down You know me Caesar

I do Even my best friend disagrees with my decisions now after all
these years of elbowrubbing

You are usually more outspoken Major DeCosta Have you nothing more
to say

DeCostas reply was slow in coming but rapid in delivery I am around
Caesar much of late he rapped out His back was stiff and military as
he strode out of the Dictators office

Prefect Lambertis gloved hand dropped to the butt of his gun but
Caesar shook his head in gentle negation

Julius Caesar Imperator V gazed sadly at the closed door

                                   

Jay had given up trying to reason with Ilaria about God The
man was intelligent as well as brillianttheres a tremendous
differenceabout everything else but he was stubbornly obstinate
to Jays arguments At least in Jays terminology he was stubbornly
obstinate All faith is stubborn obstinacy Kevin Ilarias faith was
appalling His arguments were beautiful Flawless Jay thought of his
old friend Father Omare Even that great psychologistpriest would be
hardput he decided

So he quit He didnt give up He just quit

Can you tell a man the Earths flat after hes been up in a jet

Can you talk a bullet out of pursuing its path

Can you reason with a Marxist

If a man can conquer the greatest enemy the world has ever faced is
he not God If he can turn from killing and soldiering to soothing
and pacifying is he not God If he can make the world one after
twentytwo centuries of world anarchism is he not God If he can
maintain the peace and keep the people happy and heal all sores is he
not God If he just looks at you when you call him God or Savior
and smiles and say I is he not God If he chooses the perfect man to
continue in his place is he not God

But thats proof Why die Isnt God immortal

Only God could realize that one man cant continue to reign
indefinitely His ideas yes But he must create another to carry on
his ideas There must be variety and diversions

Unshakeable Unquestioning Jay could never understand a persons
sticking to the claim Im a Christian or Im a Moslem when he would
be killed for it Jay had always figured hed have said to Neros men
Me Me A filthy Christian Not I I love Jupiter and Juno Step
inside and see my altars 

Now he was seeing what sturdy rockfirm martyr faith was like

So he quit

Instead he learned about the gyrojet cars which hugged the roads like
lovers on a honeymoon He watched them sprout stubby wings and breathe
flame and soar straight up He learned about saying Open to a lock
and having the electronic device recognize him and let him in He
learned about personalphones which recognized your voice He learned
about the tiny pellet of potassium cyanide and sulphuric acid with
which the guns were loaded The pellets struck and broke and the victim
was dead in seconds Very humane No maimed or wounded Just the dead

He learned about selfshaping sandalsthe most comfortable and most
sensible shoes man had ever wornand air baths and softvoiced
alarm clocks which politely told you it was time to get up and about
unbreakable ringfinger chronos and about atomic heating and flawless
plumbing and he saw plastic plastic plastic

He learned about all of them But his real delight was the depilatory
cream This above all others was mans greatest invention

No shaving  no silly damned socks or tight hot shoes or tie  no
battery stalling or flat tires  I guess this is paradise Kevin

And the perfect government and the perfect religion All one race One
religion One nation One language One nationality One God Ilaria
added exuberantly

That reminds me How come I never see any coloreds

Havent you By the way no murderous car insurance or alimony laws
either And no need for them All marriages are ideal

Jay was readily detoured to this new novelty

Now dont lets go too far Identical religion and race and customs
and ideals and opinions may lower the divorce rate a lot but theres
still ye olde sex angle A couple can go together twenty years and
break up on the wedding night Some are hot and some are cold and some
are slow and some are fast The only thing you could have improved
on is sex education Its astounding how many people of my time know
nothing about the sexual part of marriage The most important part

Of course its doing what comes naturally but what if two people
have been taught from different viewpoints Or if one hasnt been
taught at all Some people are actually ashamed or embarrassed There
are intelligent people who dont even know the biological facts
Fewespecially women know about the pleasure and the habitforming
angle Thats the one thing than can break up something beautiful in
ten minutes

Education maybe Human nature no

Whew

Excuse me Kevin for launching into a Phillipic but thats long been
my pet peeve Atrocious deplorable and all that

We dont usually tamper with human nature Jay As a rule that is
This is going to come as a shock to you with your silly atrocious
and deplorable  ideas and morals

A trial period A premarital period of living together for a couple
of weeks If the couple isnt sexually suited they either attempt to
have it remedied by a physician or break off

A shock yes Jay murmured slowly shaking his head How did it ever
start Anyone whod propound an idea like that in my time would be
accused of being some sort of perverted sexfiend

A foolproof flawless plan to insure happy marriages

                                   

Half across the world a door swung open and a tall dark man with
piercing black eyes and a twintufted beard came in His darkgreen
garment faintly resembling a trenchcoat was doublebreasted and
belted and military cut His feet were encased in plastileather boots
which clicked as he came to attention before the desk

The plate on the desk read Praefectus Praetoriani

Major del Ponta Sir

The man behind the desk looked up At ease Major

Major Ali ben del Ponta relaxed and waited

The man behind the desk finished scanning the sheet of micropaper
marked something on it with a stylo stuck it in the pneumatube on the
corner of his desk and pushed the button to close his desk drawer He
looked up at Major Ali ben del Ponta

Well He put his hands together fingers touching

It has begun Prefect Lamberti All over the world our local men are
leading their followers in attack Captain Abram Mazzoli has sent in
his report from Tel Aviv The city is in his hands Captain Mahomet
DiSantos Raiders have complete control of the Sahara Captain
Arnaldis forces are firmly entrenched in the old Washington area of
America He will move northward to meet Colonel Magnanis forces from
Canada and Commander Campisano They

Campisanos airborne ready to roll

Yes Sir Arrangements have been made The drop will be just outside
New York

Alright Then everything has gone off as scheduled

Yes Sir

Prefect Farouk Lamberti regarded his deskchron thoughtfully

And Caesar will make his speech in twentyfive hours and thirtythree
minutes

Major del Ponta glanced at his own chron which was strapped to the
third finger of his left hand Yes Sir At  tomorrow

Have the twentyfoot visor screen activated for public showing Mount
it outside as wed planned

Its being taken care of Sir The screen is on its way to the Square
There will be a crowd

Good We all want to hear noble Caesar

Del Ponta grinned Yes Sir We all do Especially tomorrow

He doesnt knowor suspect

He shouldnt Sir Our men took over and began covering up at once
You know the atrocious condition of world communications systems The
Empire could fall and Rome might not hear of it for days

Thats what I was counting on  that and the Disturber The
degeneracy of the field military is terrible They are allowing
themselves to get lazy and fat and careless

Yes Sir

Have my car ready to drive to the Square behind Caesars tomorrow
See that the covermen in the houses around the Square are doubled and
doublechecked But when we go to the show lets not have too great an
exhibition of Imperial power We dont want this thing to backfire and
cut our own throats

Yes Sir Del Pontas grin widened

Dismissed

Del Ponta came to attention saluted and aboutfaced and left

Prefect Lamberti opened his desk drawer and took out his old service
pistol It was a gamma gun He had not released any of the deadly
slowacting rays from its chamber in seven years But it was ready

He opened another drawer and took out a white cloak marked across the
back with a blue dove and the single word Liberacione

He checked the pistol

                                   

Does the Emissary from  get to meet Caesar Jay wanted to know

Later Hes to make a speech tomorrow afternoon It will be
worldtelevised

He looks very old and very tired Jay ventured Hed seen Caesar on
transcriptions of old speeches and on old newsreels

Hes about  forty I think Somewhat weak Very lenient

I wouldve guessed him to be a good deal older Then Why weak
Because hes lenient

Ilaria smiled Remember Jay Pax per Bello Too much leniency leads
ones subjects to be bold Overbold

One mans opinion

The Tribune shrugged No Caesar doesnt get along with his advisors
too well They criticize him for being too ready to forgive and forget

The more Jay saw of this perfect world the more he realized how cruel
and hard people must be to maintain a paradise If everyone is to be
happy someone must be unhappy

The trouble is people dont like to be told This is for your own
good

Jay said so

But if theyre sat on hard enough Ilaria rebutted they dont have
a chance ever to try anything else which they might think is for
their own good

Jay nodded Very true As Ilaria left the room Jay went to the window
and looked out at the Louisville of  For the millionth time in the
seven days hed been here he wished he had a cigarette They had been
outlawed as detrimental to health long ago

The fact that it had been seven days reminded him of something else
left behind

Julie

Youre a fool he finally told himself No wonder Julied been on
edge and acting what he termed odd lately She was scared Hed been
out of school three and a half years He was twentyfive Hed just
bought a new Olds Hed begun buying his clothes at The Store rather
than a store Hell he shouldve been married long ago His days here
were full There were meetings with scientists and historians and
militarists and linguists and everyone else Kevin could think up He
talked and listened and discussed and lectured But he thought of her
every night Every morning before he rose At times like this when he
was alone for a few minutes

Of course it was love Hed always thought too many people threw the
word around too much Hed always been afraid to use it because he
wasnt sure of its meaning Hes used it once And hed been kicked in
the teeth by the girl He hadnt used it since

When was a guy ever sure

Hogwash Now he knew that each man forms his own definition True
too many people used the word love indiscriminately Its mistreated
Kicked around Assumed and taken off Dragged through messes and
scandals and law courts and through the mud But to a man like Jay
Welch to a man who has been afraidyes afraidto use it it must
be there when he begins thinking in those terms

Love Hed had to come across onehundred years to realize hed found
its meaning To realize hed known its meaning a long time To realize
that love is whatever you make it what you yourself call it You
define it yourself Then you apply it

It had been there all the time You dont include someone in everything
you do and everything you think without it You dont try to change her
and yourself To make her perfect To make yourself perfect withand
forher without it This business about accepting little faultsas
well as big ones he decided is for the birds Its human nature to
translate other people in terms of yourself and try to change them in
terms of yourself To argue and be proud and hate like hell to have
to make up But you dont make a project of it with everyone Not
unless

He and Julie had a lot to talk about

Then he remembered where he was and when he was He thought of Doctor
Schink And suddenly he was scared He remembered what Ilaria had said
about Schink Hes there for good

Hes never said a word about my going back

Neither have you came Ilarias voice and Jay whirled around to see
the big psychologist coming through the door

Wed like to keep you here as long as possible But not against your
wishes of course You were shanghaied not kidnaped The left corner
of his wide mouth pulled back in that slow reassuring smile

I stand chastised Now Ive thought of it though I can hardly wait

The day after tomorrow I want you to hear Caesar speak Then I want
to talk a good deal more

Early the day after tomorrow Then littleboyishly Jay hurriedly
added a couple of reasons Im getting tired of talking and being
questioned I feel like a talking animal in the zoo

Ilaria nodded smiling Julie

I figured it would occur to you sooner or later Just because you
think a little more deeply and carefully than most men of your time
doesnt make you immune to love That belongs to all times Good luck
and a lot of children

Jay grinned Hed met Ilarias wife and five of his six children the
night before He turned to look out the window once more

Beautiful The elevated streets with gyrocars hurtling along  the
sky full of more winged gyros and planes  the streets below full of
happy whitefaced whiteclad people

Whitefaced

Kevin you avoided my question the day before yesterday Ive been
almost afraid to ask you again Why no Negroes

It will be hard for you to accept with your antiquated democratic
ideas Ilaria breathed a deep sigh Certain elements of dissension
and unrest Jay are better eliminated Coloreds have always bred both
People are just like that Whites and yellows and tans and reds can get
along but not blacks

Jay had gotten along with them all his life In ancient Rome there
were slaves  he said trying to understand

Not in this Rome I said better eliminated Jay Ilaria went to the
window and looked down at the scene below He explained

We exterminated them

A hammer crashed down A door slammed A glass shattered A siren
screeched A punch caught Jay in the solar plexus Jay had experienced
all these Ilarias flat statement was worse

ExterNo Oh No He swung around to face the big psychologist
Ilarias usual smile was gone He looked solemn and very grim

You werent ready for it I dont think we can discuss it Just
remember this When youve a bunch of dogs and they all get along with
one another except one you dont leave them together and you dont try
to keep them separated by a chickenwire fence Its too unpleasant
You get rid of the troublemaker

                                   

During the night the rebel forces moved out of Tel Aviv and took over
Israel They captured the entire devastated Washington area a series
of ten cities ringing Rome and hundreds of other key spots The
worlds largest airbase at Madrid Spain was taken Forces sent to the
aid of the base defenders were met by an onslaught of their own planes
The troops didnt have a chance

Dr Montmorency Trumperis Wave Disturber had been outlawed in 
The plans were carefully filed away and the machines component parts
junked But the Disturber suddenly reappeared on the night of June 
 and world communications were stopped Lambertis scientists had
come up with a counterradio mechanism of course so that the Rebels
were able to maintain contacts

Louisville was not attacked Lamberti and his men knew about the
emissary from the past sheltered there and informed their fifth
columnists at Standiford they wanted both the Man From  and Tribune
Kevin Ilaria alive

New York was attacked by land and air Tokyo fell Everywhere white
flags with the blue Liberacione and the picture of a dove fluttered
above smoking battlegrounds Everywhere men were on the march

                                   

When Tribune Kevin Ilaria stormed in twelve hours later Jay noticed
his friend was wearing his gun again The cyanide pistol had not swung
at his hip since the day of Jays arrival He was also surprised to
note that Ilaria wore boots and carried a steel helmet under his arm

There was a new quality in his voice Brittle static The soft tones
of the psychologist were gone

Jay realized that this was Tribune Ilaria of the Forces not Dr Ilaria
the psychologist

You sure you want to leave here tomorrow he demanded curtly

Instantly Jay was on the defence I am he said coldly

Ilarias smile looked forced Ive been authorized to offer you a
SubTribunate in the Forces

What

Youve had experience None of us have Youve been in actual combat
in the Air Force

Why I dont

War Ilaria said simply Rebellion

Jay stared at him He couldnt think of anything to say

Ilaria turned away Paradise The Iron Hand One religion and one
language and all that Utterly cocksure But  we were wrong
Theyve been getting ready Training and planning Collecting men and
arms They began even before the empire was establishedJay noticed
he said empire rather than republicAll this time theyve been
preparing and planning and  waiting

Jay was dumbfounded How big is it

Kevin Ilaria spread his hands Big enough Their attack seems to
have been simultaneous all over the world Something like commando or
guerrilla tactics Quick quiet attacks on a small scale

He told Jay about the Tel Aviv incident and about Captain Spagnoletti
and a halftrack disappearing in the rubble in the Washington area and
about intercontinental communication being shut off

Bomb em out Jay said without thinking

You dont bomb out fifth columnists Jay

Last night they captured London and Tokyo and twothirds of New York
and they captured Lollabrigida airbase in Madrid Theyre wearing PR
uniforms and some kind of new uniform theyve dreamed up Most of them
arent even uniformed Its a hell of a mess

How long do you think itll take to quell the thing

I have no idea Im to take command at Standiford Field Rinaldi
solved the saboteur problem  it was Colonel Di Orio Rinaldi and
some of his boys caught the Colonel and a few of his men in the Radio
Room on the special Liberacione wave length

In irons Jay wanted to know

No They put up a fight They were killed

Youre flying

Doubt it Ill be one of those behindthescenes men Supposed to be
valuable Only in a mess like this you cant tell whats behind the
scenes and whats front line Theyre liable to start on Louisville
next

Ilaria hitched selfconsciously at his gunbelt He twisted his helmet
around a couple of times before he set it gingerly on his head He
turned and opened the door and went out His head came back in and said

Im not sure its the sort of thing you quell Jay

Kevin Wait Whatm I supposed to

He was gone

Jay thought only a moment Then he switched on the phone At least
intercom systems were still in operation The clerk at the desk
upstairs looked at him from the screen

This is the Man From  Jay said using the name by which everyone
called him Stop Tribune Ilaria as he goes out

In an instant Kevins head appeared

Ill go with you Shall I get my uniform before we go to Standiford or
after

Ilaria grinned After he said Grab the elevator and come on up

This isnt your fight Jay Welch a voice told him as he opened the
door You dont even belong here Jay Welch the voice told him as he
ran out into the hall Youre crazy to go to bat for these monsters
Jay Welch the voice told him as he pushed the elevator button You
fought before for a bunch of people who didnt appreciate it one
damned bit Jay Welch Remember about the Iron Hand and the Negroes
the voice told him as the doors opened and he stepped in Remember you
were shanghaied it said as the car shot upward and the bottom of his
stomach felt as if it had been left behind Remember you were going
back to Duo Point and Hermans and Joe Scaccias restaurant and Julie
and tie and suit and Julie and the tight shoes and Julie and personal
freedom and Julie and Jerry the black guy you worked with and liked
so well and Julie and the new Olds and Julie Tomorrow you were going
back

The doors shot back He stepped out on the roof

Mister Welcci said the clerk Thats Tribune Ilarias plane over
there

He pointed to the little PR ship marked with the three silver diamonds
of a Tribune and the staff of psychology Jay ran Wind was whipping
across the roof and their cloaks streamed out and fluttered The three
men came together

This is Commander DeVito Jay Commander Jay Welch The Man From
 The way Ilaria said it always made it sound capitalized

They shook hands They got into the plane and shot straight up and the
city was a blur beneath them In less than a minute the little flier
dropped down faster than any elevator and landed at Standiford

Sergeant SubTribune Welcci needs a uniform A

Forty long Jay suggested then colored Tunic and a hundred years
made a difference in his size He went with the supplysergeant who
gave him a correct fit the first timetimes have changed Jay
gruntedand fitted him with a helmet on the second try He felt a
tremor as he buckled on the pellet gun With the cloak flapping about
his heels and the gun banging his leg and the helmet biting his ear
he ran to the elevator and down to the room Kevin had designated
The Tribune and Commander DeVito and five or six other officers were
standing around a table in the steelwalled underground room

Before them was a gigantic map They looked up as Jay burst in

This is The Man From  Ilaria said There were handshakes all
around that reminded Jay of fraternity rush DeVito and one of the
others wore wings Jay wondered if that were still a pilots insignia

The red Xs on the map they told him were places under attack The
blue ones were areas taken by the fastmoving rebels He learned that
the messengerjet theyd sent to Romethey were lost without their
instantaneous pushbutton communications systemhadnt made it More
had been sent Meanwhile they were on their own

The nearest major battle was at Chicago where Cocuzzi Flight Base was
located Ilaria despatched Commander DeVito and something like fifty
jet fighters to Chicago The other man was in charge of a group of B
Stratosonic bombers They lifted their fists in stiffarmed salute and
left

The rest of the ships will remain here ready for instant takeoff
Ill command interception SubTribune Rinaldi will command the base in
case I have to go up

I cant understand why we havent been jumped yet We must assume
theyll attack Louisville because of Standiford and the Time Building
Theyll also be interested in you Jay

                                   

By  that afternoon Louisville had not yet been attacked Abruptly
at  world communications went into operation Everyone turned on
his television set wondering if Caesars talk would go on as scheduled

It did There was a screaming crowd before the Capitol On the high
balcony stood the Dictator At his side stood Senator Chianti and
around them were ringed Caesars Pretorian Guards The city was nearly
empty of field soldiers They had gone out to meet the insurgents

People of the Republic of Rome The noise subsided as Caesar raised
his hands and spoke

You have all heard of the revolt now in progress against us throughout
the Empire

Ilaria nodded at the Caesars psychologically clever use of the word us

With your aid my people we can put a quick end to this treason
You have seen better than half a century of peaceful successful
government These traitors and conspirators would attempt to overthrow
our government and put an end to this peace  this Peace of Rome

The world is now in a state of emergency If you my people will bear
with me through this period of crisis we will return to our world of
peace and serenity once more

Cheers Wild applause

They believe him Jay murmured

Ilaria looked at him Of course he said

For a long time our Empire has remained 

Caesars face stiffened The deepset weary eyes blazed and widened
His hand reached out for the railing Then he stiffened again and was
limp as the bursting pellet of sulphuric acid and potassium cyanide
took effect

Gaius Julius Caesar Imperator V fell

There was uproar and clamor and shrieking

Jay and Ilaria stood staring as the Pretorian Guards levelled their
guns and became a solid surrounding wall The TV cameramen were
getting the scene of the century

Lamberti Ilaria bit out

The Pretorian Prefect his hands outspread stood on the balcony over
Caesars body The white cloak with Liberacione on it fluttered about
him A couple of Pretorians came out with an amplifier

Friends Romans Countrymen said Farouk Lamberti

every available longrange ship to Rome Ilarias brittle voice
was hacking out orders Every one Contact every other base while
communications are still working

 a noble man But not the man to govern Earth No not he nor his
government I bring you a new government I Farouk Lamberti long his
best friend have done this not to him but for him For you The Earth
was not meant to be governed by a system of

Yes I said bomb Rome

SubTribune Rinaldi smiled But Kevin my friend we cant bomb
Lamberti just when hes getting a good start

Jay looked up Kevin Ilaria spun around What

Never trust old friends Kevin Colonel Di Orio didnt He surprised
us in the Radio Room and we were forced to put him out of the way Also
remember this all members of the Liberacione carry gamma pistols

Rinaldi pulled out his gamma gun and shot Ilaria through the middle

Jay was horrified He forgot where he was and when he was and what he
was doing All he knew was that there was a cyanide gun at his hip and
that this man had shot Ilaria His gun came up and sputtered

The pellet caught Rinaldi just under the chin and burst Rinaldi
collapsed

Had agamma gunnot  deadly Slowacting  radioactivity
Hardly  burned me Come onweve got to  get back to theTime
building

Oh no we wont Youre hurt We

Dont argue Sergeant Saaarguunt Ilaria gasped at the exertion of
shouting The Centurion ran in

Weve got toget to theTime building

Rinaldi shot the Tribune Rinaldi was a traitor Jay explained
rapidly

Ilarias gun clicked and the Centurion shuddered back and fell through
the door The gamma burst from his pistol hit the wall

God Is everyone a traitor Jay demanded of the Universe

                                   

People are easily swayed It didnt take them long to espouse the new
cause They were helped along in their decision by the Liberacione
planes hovering overhead with loads of KCNHSO bombs The whispering
campaign Lamberti had carefully started about germ warfare helped too
Those who didnt switch over rapidly were jumped by the new forces
Tribune Ilaria in Louisville Kentucky in America held out as long
as he could Then the bombers came And the Tribune fled to the Time
building

The building shook A table shivered and a lamp shattered A jet
fighter flew close by the window and the Centurion watched fearfully as
it flipped on one delta wing and fired a tracer burst into a PR ship
The defender exploded in midair

Ilaria looked twenty years older than the man who had smiled and
welcomed Jay Welch to  He and a young scientist were preparing the
machine to send the man from  back to his own time

Youll have to leave the gun here Jay Ilaria winced as he bent over
a set of dials

Id like to keep the uniform

All right Does that do it Doctor

The scientist nodded He looked at Jay Its ready he said

This switch sets everything in motion doesnt it Ilaria asked

Yes Thats the final control

Then  Ill do it Id like  to say something to Jay before he
leaves

The scientist hesitated a moment then shrugged and left The Centurion
went to the door He was a young man and fanatically loyal

You all right Tribune

Ilaria smiled Im  all right Sergeant

The Centurion nodded and left

Sit  sit down in that chair Jay and do your best to relax

Jay sat down A bomber roared overhead There was a blast nearby

What will you do now Kevin

Ilaria shrugged Fight em til they come in and were sunk Then
Ill join em Whywhy die a martyrs death

Of course Jay told himself Logical But Kevin had been so convinced
So utterly sure Now he looked and sounded like a disillusioned old man

Kevin Im not trying to rub it in But

I know what youre going to say I was so sure Paradise I was a firm
disciple Convinced I believed in all of it Ithought it would last
forever The perfect government A permanently workable government

Jay sat quietly Ilaria reached for the switch

For Gods sake came the voice of  what is the perfect
workable government

Ilaria closed the switch and the light blinded Jay He felt as if
someone had slugged him in the stomach Slowly the machine prepared to
send him back onehundred years It warmed up like a jet on a runway

The light faded and Jay opened his eyes The building rocked There was
a terrific explosion and part of the steel wall buckled Somewhere a
woman screamed A squadron of fighters hurtled past spitting fire and
death A bomber fell exploding as it crashed into a tall apartment
building Jays stomach twisted and he knew he was on his way Ilaria
took his gun from his holster and calmly placed its ugly snout against
his own face

 the perfect workable government Jays question of a moment ago
reached his ears as he began to slip back minute by minute picking up
momentum Ilarias reply came dimly

There is none

volunteer support

necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition
