                          a little knowledge

                         BY RUSS WINTERBOTHAM

                       Earthmen were considered
                    stupid But they knew something
                      that the alien didntand
                        about his own planet

Even with modern conveniences Caesar could never have staged such a
triumph and in the face of world historymaking he wouldnt have
reason to Olbus visit to the earth was certainly a bigger deal for
the archives than anything Caesar ever did

No one can say you arent a good sport commended Ralph Rodkey of
the Interstate Broadcasting Network You had plenty of reason to be
annoyed especially when the mob tried to tear your clothes off But
the people meant no harm they just adore you

Olbu had learned English overnight and mastered it He hardly had an
accent I was a little disturbed you might say

Well our people are hero worshippers Rodkey explained And
youre certainly a hero being the first man from off the Earth to
land on the Earth you might say And then too given an opportunity
to celebrate an Earthman will take full advantage of the slightest
excuse

Rather barbaric said Olbu But then this is a barbaric planet

Uh Oh yes Just joking of course Now were about ready for
our telecast with Cecil Burroughs the greatest commentator in the
business Youll appear with one of our leading scientists

I hope he can understand the things I shall talk about

We may not know much about space flight but we know a lot of things
my boy said Rodkey

You say you dont travel in space as yet

No and youre the first visitor from space weve had You see no
planets of this solar system are inhabited by intelligent forms of
life

You can say that again said Olbu

With the exception of the Earth of course Rodkey laughed We were
very thrilled to have someone drop in on us

How strange

In fact many of our people figured that Man was unique They thought
he couldnt exist anywhere but here

It would be nice if such were the case said Olbu But Im afraid
the galaxy is not so fortunate Many planets have men Some are more
like men than others if you understand what I mean But they all have
his chief faults and good points

Rodkey had arranged for the interview in the Presidential suite of the
Claremont Hotel and in the next room electricians were busy setting up
the equipment Presently the door opened and a man of about  clean
shaven and slightly bald paused in the doorway He looked at the
confusion for a moment hesitated as if he were checking an impulse to
flee then spotted Rodkey through the bedroom door

Dr Bruber exclaimed Rodkey

Dr Alymir Bruber beamed extended his hand and strode forward

He tripped over a cable but caught himself on the doorframe with
nothing worse than a bumped shoulder

Rodkey pumped his hand enthusiastically Its been a long time
Doctor he said slapping him on the shoulder Remember we met when
I interviewed you on the nervous electron factor of your diatomic
equivalent energy principle back in 

Oh said Bruber Yes I remember you well He turned his head
toward Olbu One glance would have convinced anyone that Olbu was from
spaceor at least another planet He had an unusually large head
small neck skinny arms and legs and a pot belly Everyone knows that
people from other planets have all of these things The only thing
wrong with Olbu was that his eyes were just like anyones eyes a
little slanted perhaps but not more so than the average oriental and
of course Olbu had no feelers extending from his forehead But those
things werent absolutely necessary in a man who looked the part as
Olbu did

This must be our visitor Once more Dr Bruber extended his hand and
this time he tripped over the rug but Rodkey was handy to catch him

My glasses explained Dr Bruber Theyre only bifocals and I have
trouble adjusting to middle distances

Olbu said Rodkey allow me to present Dr Bruber the worlds
greatest living scientist

Dr Bruber laughed nervously and shook hands with Olbu Im afraid Mr
Rodkey is being extravagant Actually Im not the greatest Only the
greatest in my field Im second greatest in three others though

Dr Bruber is too modest said Rodkey Theres practically nothing
that he doesnt know

No one knows nothing said Olbu

Dr Bruber blinked as he tried to figure that one out It doubtless
hinged on a lingual difference to start with and so he gave up

Well gentlemen said Rodkey our broadcast will start in thirty
minutes Perhaps we can go over briefly what topics we should talk
upon You know we dont want to get into anything too deep for our
viewers to understand yet we dont want to be too trivial you know
Give them something interesting I always say Then if we have any time
left we might touch on some topics that go a little beyond that

Did you have a nice trip asked Dr Bruber

It was beastly said Olbu Thirtytwo light years of space and not
even an interesting meteor

Were on the verge of making an interplanetary flight here on Earth
Dr Bruber said The trouble is no one that wants a flight has any
money and those that have the money dont care about space flight

Youre probably better off all around said Olbu

Come now gentlemen said Rodkey We can do better than that You
can cut loose with a few scientific terms now and then It gives the
interview an authentic flavor Ask Olbu his opinion of the quantum
jump Dr Bruber

Dr Bruber turned toward the director and blinked through his heavy
glasses Id rather ask our distinguished visitor why he came

Yes Dr Bruber Please do said Olbu

All right Why did you come here

We wanted to decide whether to wipe out the solar system or not

                                   

For a moment it was silent in the room except for the sound of the
electricians outside the door Goddamit said an electrician You
cant use that hookup on the Ycircuit Youll cut out the monitors

Ralph Rodkey tiptoed to the bedroom door and closed it

Surely youre joking said Dr Bruber Quite a sense of humor
HaHa

No Im not We discovered there was at least one habitable planet
hereand where there are habitable planets there are likely to be
human beings Human beings are dangerous

Rodkey cleared his throat Gentlemen Far be it from me to interfere
in a scientific discussion like this but if I were you Id try another
tack A large number of our viewers might not understand it

You think it would be better perhaps if we killed them all without
warning Olbu said turning toward the director

Really Mr Olbu said Rodkey You dont intend to blot us out do
you

That decision is hardly mine to make said Olbu Ill have to report
to my superiors If youre dangerous youll have to be erased and
theres nothing that can be done about it

Excuse me a moment Rodkey rose went to the phone and ordered liquor
sent up to the room He hung up the receiver I think its best that
we make your stay here a pleasant one Olbu

If you intend to bribe me Im afraid youll have no success said
Olbu I was chosen because I am impeccable

Im quite sure of it said Dr Bruber And perhaps there is
something in your premise that not all human beings are desirable I
should like to know how Earth is making out

Olbu shrugged his shoulders So far Ive seen nothing worth saving
he said Youre a vain lot Youre trivial You have no respect for
the dignity of Man And your worst fault is ambition I suppose you
have wars

Not for a long time Two or three years anyhow said Rodkey

How long is a year Ah yes I forgot It is the period of the planet
on its journey around the sun And how long does that take One year
The usual nonsensical way you have of defining things You dont even
know how to measure time

How very interesting exclaimed Dr Bruber Actually it never
occurred to me that there might be an absolute method of measuring
time What is it

Its the Mpto Fortythree and a third Mptos make an Anup and twelve
million Anups make a Zorex Its a lot simpler than seconds minutes
hours days weeks and so on

Yes I see said Dr Bruber But getting back to our topic Just
what should we have that would make us worth saving

Stability said Olbu Earthmen lack stability

Dont you think you should talk more about your trip Rodkey asked
How did Saturn look when you passed it

Saturn wasnt in the right place to be seen at all Dr Bruber said
But you did see Pluto How did it look

There was nothing about it and it looked awful said Olbu

I hate to be injecting my own personal ideas into this conversation
said Rodkey because after all I know nothing about science But
dont you suppose it would please our viewers if we talked more about
space flight than about the destruction of the human race

You see said Olbu to Dr Bruber Thats what I mean No stability

After all the poor man doesnt want to lose his job Bruber
explained Id say that was a desire to be stable

If hes going to be dead which he will be when I get word from my
superiors hell lose his job whether he wants to or not said Olbu

Ill go along with a joke as well as anyone said Rodkey but
gentlemen weve only got twelve minutes till we go on the air Now
lets cut out this nonsense about destroying Earth and talk about
something pleasant

Certainly said Dr Bruber What planet did you come from

Xvik said Olbu Its the fourth planet of a star you call GC

Good old GC said Dr Bruber

Oh you know that star

Yes its a minor variable loosely attached to Lyra

Theres nothing loose about my star said Olbu

Im sure Dr Bruber didnt mean it that way said Rodkey hastily He
looked nervously at Dr Bruber Did you doctor

Thats one of the things I dont know he said wiping his glasses on
his handkerchief Tell me Olbu if you should decide we arent worth
saving how would you communicate with your superiors considering
theyre  light years away Wouldnt it take  yearsthirtytwo
going and thirtytwo comingto get a message through

Oh no I communicate by instantaneous telepathy said Olbu Its
much faster than energy forms of communication

I wish youd talk about something else said Rodkey Only ten
minutes to go

Dr Bruber disregarded the request I dont know why people on a
planet  light years away should consider Earth dangerous

Oh Earth isnt Its only the people on it said Olbu

How do you know about the people

We have a method of enlarging telescopic photos to bring out every
detail We know all about Man weve watched you from the days when
your ancestors lived in caves

Goodness You know more about us than we know ourselves

Why dont you tell our viewers about that exclaimed Rodkey

Yes went on Olbu who also seemed to have forgotten the existence
of Rodkey we saw your ancestors fight with sticks and stones We
saw them use spears then gunpowder Then we saw the atom bomb and the
Council decided to send me to see if anything could be salvaged

But the bomb was  years ago said Dr Bruber

Twelve Zorax corrected Olbu Ive been on the way here for twelve
Zoraxor if you willthirtytwo light years two hundred time years

Surely the atom bomb cant affect your existence when we dont even
have space flight said Dr Bruber

My race has developed a type of logic that can look into the future
said Olbu We know that certain patterns develop from past events In
your case youll follow the Atom bomb with the Hydrogen bomb and the
Hydrogen bomb with the Cobalt bomb

We have them both

Ah You see Our logical foresight is infallible said Olbu
Next youll wipe out nations when only one is left youll fight
neighboring planets Since you havent any inhabited near neighbors
youll have to invade Alpha Centauri After that youll battle with
other stars until youve conquered the cluster then the galaxy
finally the universe Its a very unstable state of affairs

Slowly Dr Bruber nodded Youre right I never realized where science
was taking us You have something ready to wipe us out with

Yes said Olbu Just beyond the moon circling the Earth and
the moon as a satellite is a missile which I can bring here by
instantaneous telepathy as soon as I have my orders from my superior

I trust youll postpone the fateful message until after our telecast

Olbu smiled graciously A dying man is usually granted his last
request

Gentlemen said Rodkey wiping his brow with a damp handkerchief
theyre waiting for us in the next room Were on in a minute He
opened the door allowed Olbu to pass through first and then whispered
to Dr Bruber I guess my job doesnt matter now At least well scoop
the other networks on the end of the world

Tish tosh old man said Dr Bruber Your jobs safe and so is the
world But if I should resort to murder in the next fifteen minutes I
hope youll testify in my behalf

                                   

Dr Bruber walked through the door tripped over a cable and sprawled
in front of the television cameras Rodkey helped him to his feet
and steered him to a seat to the left of the distinguished news
commentator Cecil Burroughs On the right of the commentator sat Olbu
bobbing his huge head and smiling

Rodkey barely got out of camera range in time to give the signal

                                   

Burroughs gave the commercial which had nothing to do with
interplanetary flight or anything else of interest NOW ladies
and gentlemen said Burroughs our two distinguished scientists
have a great deal to tell us about two widely separated points in the
universe

Dr Bruber smiled into the camera Just before we went on the air
Mr Burroughs he said Ambassador Olbu and I had an interesting
discussion about the merits of Earth He contends that it is unstable

You are twisting my words around doctor interpolated Olbu I made
it clear that it was not the planet itself but the people who are
objectionable

The people spoil the planet

In a sense The people are dangerous the planet is not

Would it be possible for a planet to spoil the people

Olbu seemed to digest the words in his mind before he spoke That is
a rather weak effort to shift the blame from the shoulders of those
responsible for a sad state of affairs doctor You are trying to say
there is something in the air or the water that makes Earthmen what
they are

No I was hinting that there might be something wrong with your
planet Mr Olbu

Nonsense Nothing is wrong with my planet My people would not be
affected even if the air and water were bad We the children of Xvik
are the highest expression of the human race

Its easy to see that said Dr Bruber You were pointing out to
me that Earths pattern of existence doesnt offer much hope for the
future

That is right said Olbu Earths future is not much to look
forward to

But the planet is worth saving

Definitely

Yet the people are a part of the planet

You should study logic Dr Bruber Youre trying to make me say
things that are not logical

Okay lets forget logic and look at what Earth is likely to do if it
follows its natural trend You say it will destroy itself

If someone else doesnt do it first said Olbu It will continue to
have wars till it exhausts all opportunities for it on the planet Then
it will war in the skies with other planets with other stars finally
with other galaxies Man has a thirst for power and that thirst is
never satisfied On the other hand knowledge leads to contentment If
the Earth should seek knowledge it would forget war

Perhaps war is necessary for survival suggested Dr Bruber

War is seldom fought for survival It is a result of a struggle for
supremacy And might I ask supremacy of what After youve conquered
all the galaxies what do you have

Olbu seems to have a point there said Burroughs It is now time for
a brief message from our sponsor

The message had nothing to do with war or knowledge

Now Olbu began Burroughs we were talking about wars knowledge
power and survival Do you have anything else to add

Only that Earth has brought this on itself said Olbu

I dont quite understand Cecil Burroughs wrinkled his massive brow

What our distinguished visitor is trying to say said Dr Bruber is
that a planet is only as stable as its people And a star system is
only as stable as its planets Isnt that it Ambassador

You have a roundabout method of stating nothing at all said Olbu
What Im trying to tell you is that sometimes worlds must come to an
end

Exactly said Dr Bruber Ive made a study of GC for many years
and Im quite familiar with it This star as many scientists know
became a super nova about fifteen years ago

What Olbus eyes grew less slanting and more round

It was an unstable star said Dr Bruber The Earth with all its
faults is stable It may be young impulsive inclined to play with
fireatomic fire no lessbut it will grow up some day

My star my planetgone

You havent been in contact with your home base since you arrived
Dr Bruber asked

I was not supposed to contact my base said Olbu until He
stopped abruptly and those with him were aware of the fact that he was
using his mental powers to call his superiorsThe lengthening silence
seemed to give proof to Brubers words

Since you have no world to go to interrupted the Dr gently I hope
youll be our guest Perhaps you can teach us something about space
flight and your mental powers

Oh yes said Olbu eagerly And if I have by any chance cast
reflections on your planet

My dear Mr Olbu science has never suffered when scientists have
dealt frankly with problems at hand

Im afraid our time is up put in Cecil Burroughs Thank you
gentlemen and I hope our viewers will tune in again next week when
we will have two interesting personalities Sam Katchum who tames
rattlesnakes and Joe Wattles who stuffs cobras Glad we could be
together

Ralph Rodkey shook Dr Brubers hand as he emerged from the broadcast
room You saved my life you saved my job

Think nothing of it Ralph It was nothing I wouldnt have done for
myself

But if you hadnt known about GC becoming a super nova

You dont think the loss of GC was accidental do you

Good Lord Bruber I dont know anything about those things

As our friend Olbu said Man develops along certain patterns  first
his own planet then neighboring planets then star systems

You dont think

I do Rodkey I do Somebody else was just a little more advanced than
GC and did to them what they wanted to do to us

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all  states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit wwwgutenbergorgdonate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations To

Section  General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic works

Professor Michael S Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenbergtm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone For forty years he produced and
distributed Project Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support

Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the US unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility wwwgutenbergorg

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenbergtm
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks
