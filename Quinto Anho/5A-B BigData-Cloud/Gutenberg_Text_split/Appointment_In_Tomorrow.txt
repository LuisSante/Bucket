         Is it possible to have a world without moral values
         Or does lack of morality become a moral value also


The first angry rays of the sunwhich startlingly enough still rose
in the east at  hour intervalspierced the lacy tops of Atlantic
combers and touched thousands of sleeping Americans with unconscious
fear because of their unpleasant similarity to the rays from World War
IIIs atomic bombs

They turned to blood the witchcircle of rusty steel skeletons around
Inferno in Manhattan Without comment they pointed a cosmic finger at
the tarnished brass plaque commemorating the martyrdom of the Three
Physicists after the dropping of the Hell Bomb They tenderly touched
the rosy skin and strawberry bruises on the naked shoulders of a
girl sleeping off a drunk on the furry and radiantly heated floor of
a nearby roof garden They struck green magic from the glassy blot
that was Old Washington Twelve hours before they had revealed things
as eerily beautiful and as ravaged in Asia and Russia They pinked
the white walls of the Colonial dwelling of Morton Opperly near the
Institute for Advanced Studies upstairs they slanted impartially
across the Pharoahlike and openeyed face of the elderly physicist and
the ugly sleepsurly one of young Willard Farquar in the next room
And in nearby New Washington they made of the spire of the Thinkers
Foundation a blue and optimistic glory that outshone White House Jr

It was America approaching the end of the Twentieth Century America
of jukebox burlesque and your local radiation hospital America
of the maskfad for women and Mystic Christianity America of the
offthebosom dress and the New Blue Laws America of the Endless War
and the loyalty detector America of marvelous Maizie and the monthly
rocket to Mars America of the Thinkers and a few remembered the
Institute Knock on titanium Whadya do for blackouts Please
lover dont think when Im around America as combatshocked and
crippled as the rest of the bombshattered planet

Not one impudent photon of the sunlight penetrated the triplepaned
polarizing windows of Jorj Helmuths bedroom in the Thinkers
Foundation yet the clock in his brain awakened him to the minute
or almost Switching off the Educational Sandman in the midst of the
phrase  applying tensor calculus to the nucleus he took a
deep even breath and cast his mind to the limits of the world and
his knowledge It was a somewhat shadowy vision but he noted with
impartial approval definitely less shadowy than yesterday morning

Employing a rapid mental scanning technique he next cleared his memory
chains of false associations including those acquired while asleep
These chores completed he held his finger on a bedside button which
rotated the polarizing window panes until the room slowly filled with a
muted daylight Then still flat on his back he turned his head until
he could look at the remarkably beautiful blonde girl asleep beside him

                                   

Remembering last night he felt a pang of exasperation which he
instantly quelled by taking his mind to a higher and dispassionate
level from which he could look down on the girl and even himself as
quaint clumsy animals Still he grumbled silently Caddy might have
had enough consideration to clear out before he awoke He wondered
if he shouldnt have used his hypnotic control of the girl to smooth
their relationship last night and for a moment the word that would
send her into deep trance trembled on the tip of his tongue But no
that special power of his over her was reserved for far more important
purposes

Pumping dynamic tension into his yearold muscles and confidence
into his yearold mind the yearold Thinker rose from bed
No covers had to be thrown off the nuclear heating unit made them
unnecessary He stepped into his clothingthe severe tunic tights and
sockassins of the modern business man Next he glanced at the message
tape beside his phone washed down with ginger ale a vitaaminoenzyme
tablet and walked to the window There gazing along the rows of newly
planted mutant oaks lining Decontamination Avenue his smooth face
broke into a smile

It had come to him the next big move in the intricate game making
up his lifeand mankinds Come to him during sleep as so many of
his best decisions did because he regularly employed the timesaving
technique of somnothought which could function at the same time as
somnolearning

He set his whowhere robot for Rocket Physicist and Genius Class
While it worked he dictated to his stenorobot the following brief
message

    Dear Fellow Scientist

    A project is contemplated that will have a crucial bearing on mans
    future in deep space Ample nonmilitary Government funds are
    available There was a time when professional men scoffed at the
    Thinkers Then there was a time when the Thinkers perforce neglected
    the professional men Now both times are past May they never
    return I would like to consult you this afternoon three oclock
    sharp Thinkers Foundation I

    Jorj Helmuth

Meanwhile the whowhere had tossed out a dozen cards He glanced
through them hesitated at the name Willard Farquar looked at the
sleeping girl then quickly tossed them all into the addressorobot and
plugged in the stenorobot

The buzzlight blinked green and he switched the phone to audio

The President is waiting to see Maizie sir a clear feminine voice
announced He has the general staff with him

Martian peace to him Jorj Helmuth said Tell him Ill be down in a
few minutes

                                   

Huge as a primitive nuclear reactor the great electronic brain loomed
above the knot of hushvoiced men It almost filled a twostory room in
the Thinkers Foundation Its front was an orderly expanse of controls
indicators telltales and terminals the upper ones reached by a chair
on a boom

Although as far as anyone knew it could sense only the information
and questions fed into it on a tape the human visitors could not
resist the impulse to talk in whispers and glance uneasily at the great
cryptic cube After all it had lately taken to moving some of its
own controlsthe permissible onesand could doubtless improvise a
hearing apparatus if it wanted to

For this was the thinking machine beside which the Marks and Eniacs and
Maniacs and Maddidas and Minervas and Mimirs were less than Morons
This was the machine with a million times as many synapses as the human
brain the machine that remembered by cutting delicate notches in the
rims of molecules instead of kindergarten paperpunching or the Coney
Island shimmying of columns of mercury This was the machine that had
given instructions on building the last threequarters of itself This
was the goal perhaps toward which fallible human reasoning and biased
human judgment and feeble human ambition had evolved

This was the machine that really thoughta millionplus

This was the machine that the timid cyberneticists and stuffy
professional scientists had said could not be built Yet this was the
machine that the Thinkers with characteristic Yankee push had
built And nicknamed with characteristic Yankee irreverence and
girlfondness Maizie

Gazing up at it the President of the United States felt a chord
plucked within him that hadnt been sounded for decades the dark and
shivery organ chord of his Baptist childhood Here in a strange sense
although his reason rejected it he felt he stood face to face with
the living God infinitely stern with the sternness of reality yet
infinitely just No tiniest error or wilful misstep could ever escape
the scrutiny of this vast mentality He shivered

                                   

The grizzled generalthere was also one who was graywas thinking
that this was a very odd link in the chain of command Some shadowy and
usually wellcontrolled memories from World War II faintly stirred his
ire Here he was giving orders to a being immeasurably more intelligent
than himself And always orders of the Tell me how to kill that man
rather than the Kill that man sort The distinction bothered him
obscurely It relieved him to know that Maizie had builtin controls
which made her always the servant of humanity or of humanitys
rightminded leaderseven the Thinkers werent certain which

The gray general was thinking uneasily and like the President at a
more turbid level of the resemblance between Papal infallibility and
the dictates of the machine Suddenly his bony wrists began to tremble
He asked himself Was this the Second Coming Mightnt an incarnation
be in metal rather than flesh

The austere Secretary of State was remembering what hed taken such
pains to make everyone forget his youthful flirtation at Lake Success
with Buddhism Sitting before his guru his teacher feeling the
Occidentals awe at the wisdom of the East or its pretense he had
felt a little like this

The burly Secretary of Space who had come up through United Rockets
was thanking his stars that at any rate the professional scientists
werent responsible for this job Like the grizzled general hed
always felt suspicious of men who kept telling you how to do things
rather than doing them themselves In World War III hed had his fill
of the professional physicists with their eternal taint of a misty
sort of radicalism and freethinking The Thinkers were bettermore
disciplined more human Theyd called their brainmachine Maizie
which helped take the curse off her Somewhat

                                   

The Presidents Secretary a paunchy veteran of party caucuses was
also glad that it was the Thinkers who had created the machine though
he trembled at the power that it gave them over the Administration
Still you could do business with the Thinkers And nobody not even
the Thinkers could do business that sort of business with Maizie

Before that great square face with its thousands of tiny metal
features only Jorj Helmuth seemed at ease busily entering on the
tape the complex Questions of the Day that the high officials had
handed him logistics for the Endless War in Pakistan optimum size for
next years sugarcorn crop current thought trends in average Soviet
mindsprofound questions yet many of them phrased with surprising
simplicity For figures technical jargon and laymans language were
alike to Maizie there was no need to translate into mathematical
shorthand as with the lesser brainmachines

The click of the taper went on until the Secretary of State had twice
nervously fired a cigaret with his ultrasonic lighter and twice quickly
put it away No one spoke

Jorj looked up at the Secretary of Space Section Five Question
Fourwhom would that come from

The burly man frowned That would be the physics boys Opperlys
group Is anything wrong

Jorj did not answer A bit later he quit taping and began to adjust
controls going up on the boomchair to reach some of them Eventually
he came down and touched a few more then stood waiting

From the great cube came a profound steady purring Involuntarily the
six officials backed off a bit Somehow it was impossible for a man to
get used to the sound of Maizie starting to think

                                   

Jorj turned smiling And now gentlemen while we wait for Maizie
to celebrate there should be just enough time for us to watch the
takeoff of the Mars rocket He switched on a giant television screen
The others made a quarter turn and there before them glowed the rich
ochres and blues of a New Mexico sunrise and in the middle distance a
silvery mighty spindle

Like the generals the Secretary of Space suppressed a scowl Here
was something that ought to be spang in the center of his official
territory and the Thinkers had locked him completely out of it That
rocket therejust an ordinary Earth satellite vehicle commandeered
from the Army but equipped by the Thinkers with Maiziedesigned
nuclear motors capable of the Mars journey and more The first
spaceshipand the Secretary of Space was not in on it

Still he told himself Maizie had decreed it that way And when
he remembered what the Thinkers had done for him in rescuing him
from breakdown with their mental science in rescuing the whole
Administration from collapse he realized he had to be satisfied And
that was without taking into consideration the amazing additional
mental discoveries that the Thinkers were bringing down from Mars

Lord the President said to Jorj as if voicing the Secretarys
feeling I wish you people could bring a couple of those wise little
devils back with you this trip Be a good thing for the country

Jorj looked at him a bit coldly Its quite unthinkable he said
The telepathic abilities of the Martians make them extremely
sensitive The conflicts of ordinary Earth minds would impinge on them
psychotically even fatally As you know the Thinkers were able to
contact them only because of our degree of learned mental poise and
errorless memorychains So for the present it must be our task alone
to glean from the Martians their astounding mental skills Of course
some day in the future when we have discovered how to armor the minds
of the Martians

Sure I know the President said hastily Shouldnt have mentioned
it Jorj

Conversation ceased They waited with growing tension for the great
violet flames to bloom from the base of the silvery shaft

                                   

Meanwhile the question tape like a New Years streamer tossed out
a high window into the night sped on its dark way along spinning
rollers Curling with an intricate aimlessness curiously like that
of such a streamer it tantalized the silvery fingers of a thousand
relays saucily evaded the glances of ten thousand electric eyes
impishly darted down a narrow black alleyway of memory banks and
reaching the center of the cube suddenly emerged into a small room
where a suave fat man in shorts sat drinking beer

He flipped the tape over to him with practiced finger eyeing it as
a stockbroker might have studied a ticker tape He read the first
question closed his eyes and frowned for five seconds Then with the
staccato selfconfidence of a hack writer he began to tape out the
answer

For many minutes the only sounds were the rustle of the paper ribbon
and the click of the taper except for the seconds the fat man took to
close his eyes or to drink or pour beer Once too he lifted a phone
asked a concise question waited half a minute listened to an answer
then went back to the grind

Until he came to Section Five Question Four That time he did his
thinking with his eyes open

The question was Does Maizie stand for Maelzel

He sat for a while slowly scratching his thigh His loose persuasive
lips tightened without closing into the shape of a snarl

Suddenly he began to tape again

Maizie does not stand for Maelzel Maizie stands for amazing
humorously given the form of a girls name Section Six Answer One
The midterm election viewcasts should be spaced as follows

But his lips didnt lose the shape of a snarl

                                   

Five hundred miles above the ionosphere the Mars rocket cut off
its fuel and slumped gratefully into an orbit that would carry it
effortlessly around the world at that altitude The pilot unstrapped
himself and stretched but he didnt look out the viewport at the
driedmud disc that was Earth cloaked in its haze of blue sky He knew
he had two maddening months ahead of him in which to do little more
than that Instead he unstrapped Sappho

Used to free fall from two previous experiences and loving it the
fluffy little cat was soon bounding about the cabin in curves and
gyrations that would have made her the envy of all backalley and
parlor felines on the planet below A miracle cat in the dream world of
free fall For a long time she played with a string that the man would
toss out lazily Sometimes she caught the string on the fly sometimes
she swam for it frantically

After a while the man grew bored with the game He unlocked a drawer
and began to study the details of the wisdom he would discover on
Mars this trippriceless spiritual insights that would be balm to
warbattered mankind

The cat carefully selected a spot three feet off the floor curled up
on the air and went to sleep

                                   

Jorj Helmuth snipped the emerging answer tape into sections and handed
each to the appropriate man Most of them carefully tucked theirs away
with little more than a glance but the Secretary of Space puzzled over
his

Who the devil would Maelzel be he asked

A remote look came into the eyes of the Secretary of State Edgar
Allen Poe he said frowningly with eyes halfclosed

The grizzled general snapped his fingers Sure Maelzels Chess
player Read it when I was a kid About an automaton that was supposed
to play chess Poe proved it hid a man inside it

The Secretary of Space frowned Now whats the point in a fool
question like that

You said it came from Opperlys group Jorj asked sharply

The Secretary of Space nodded The others looked at the two men
puzzledly

Who would that be Jorj pressed The group I mean

The Secretary of Space shrugged Oh the usual little bunch over at
the Institute Hindeman Gregory Opperly himself Oh yes and young
Farquar

Sounds like Opperlys getting senile Jorj commented coldly Id
investigate

The Secretary of Space nodded He suddenly looked tough I will Right
away

                                   

Sunlight striking through French windows spotlighted a ballet of dust
motes untroubled by airconditioning Morton Opperlys living room was
wellkept but worn and quite behind the times Instead of reading tapes
there were books instead of stenorobots pen and ink while in place
of a four by six TV screen a Picasso hung on the wall Only Opperly
knew that the painting was still faintly radioactive that it had been
riskily so when hed smuggled it out of his bombsinged apartment in
New York City

The two physicists fronted each other across a coffee table The face
of the elder was cadaverous largeeyed and tenderfined down by
a long life of abstract thought That of the younger was forceful
sensuous bulky as his body and exceptionally ugly He looked rather
like a bear

Opperly was saying So when he asked who was responsible for the
Maelzel question I said I didnt remember He smiled They still
allow me my absentmindedness since it nourishes their contempt
Almost my sole remaining privilege The smile faded Why do you keep
on teasing the zoo animals Willard he asked without rancor Ive
maintained many times that we shouldnt truckle to them by yielding
to their demand that we ask Maizie questions You and the rest have
overruled me But then to use those questions to convey veiled insults
isnt reasonable Apparently the Secretary of Space was bothered enough
about this last one to pay me a copter call within twenty minutes of
this mornings meeting at the Foundation Why do you do it Willard

The features of the other convulsed unpleasantly Because the
Thinkers are charlatans who must be exposed he rapped out We know
their Maizie is no more than a tealeafreading fake Weve traced their
Mars rockets and found they go nowhere We know their Martian mental
science is bunk

But weve already exposed the Thinkers very thoroughly Opperly
interposed quietly You know the good it did

Farquar hunched his Japanesewrestler shoulders Then its got to be
done until it takes

Opperly studied the bowl of mutated flowers by the coffee pot I think
you just want to tease the animals for some personal reason of which
you probably arent aware

Farquar scowled Were the ones in the cages

                                   

Opperly continued his inspection of the flowers bells All the more
reason not to poke sticks through the bars at the lions and tigers
strolling outside No Willard Im not counseling appeasement But
consider the age in which we live It wants magicians His voice grew
especially tranquil A scientist tells people the truth When times
are goodthat is when the truth offers no threatpeople dont mind
But when times are very very bad A shadow darkened his eyes
Well we all know what happened to And he mentioned three names
that had been household words in the middle of the century They
were the names on the brass plaque dedicated to the martyred three
physicists

He went on A magician on the other hand tells people what they
wish were truethat perpetual motion works that cancer can be cured
by colored lights that a psychosis is no worse than a head cold that
theyll live forever In good times magicians are laughed at Theyre a
luxury of the spoiled wealthy few But in bad times people sell their
souls for magic cures and buy perpetual motion machines to power their
war rockets

Farquar clenched his fist All the more reason to keep chipping away
at the Thinkers Are we supposed to beg off from a job because its
difficult and dangerous

Opperly shook his head Were to keep clear of the infection of
violence In my day Willard I was one of the Frightened Men Later I
was one of the Angry Men and then one of the Minds of Despair Now Im
convinced that all my reactions were futile

Exactly Farquar agreed harshly You reacted You didnt act If
you men who discovered atomic energy had only formed a secret league
if youd only had the foresight and the guts to use your tremendous
bargaining position to demand the power to shape mankinds future

By the time you were born Willard Opperly interrupted dreamily
Hitler was merely a name in the history books We scientists werent
the stuff out of which cloakanddagger men are made Can you imagine
Oppenheimer wearing a mask or Einstein sneaking into the Old White
House with a bomb in his briefcase He smiled Besides thats not
the way power is seized New ideas arent useful to the man bargaining
for poweronly established facts or lies are

Just the same it would have been a good thing if youd had a little
violence in you

No Opperly said

Ive got violence in me Farquar announced shoving himself to his
feet

                                   

Opperly looked up from the flowers I think you have he agreed

But what are we to do Farquar demanded Surrender the world to
charlatans without a struggle

Opperly mused for a while I dont know what the world needs now
Everyone knows Newton as the great scientist Few remember that
he spent half his life muddling with alchemy looking for the
philosophers stone Which Newton did the world need then

Now you are justifying the Thinkers

No I leave that to history

And history consists of the actions of men Farquar concluded I
intend to act The Thinkers are vulnerable their power fantastically
precarious Whats it based on A few lucky guesses Faithhealing
Some science hocuspocus on the level of those jukebox burlesque acts
between the strips Dubious mental comfort given to a few nervetorn
neurotics in the Inner Cabinetand their wives The fact that the
Thinkers clever stagemanaging won the President a doubtful election
The erroneous belief that the Soviets pulled out of Iraq and Iran
because of the Thinkers Mind Bomb threat A brainmachine thats just
a cover for Jan Tregarrons guesswork Oh yes and that hogwash of
Martian wisdom All of it mere bluff A few pushes at the right times
and points are all that are neededand the Thinkers know it Ill bet
theyre terrified already and will be more so when they find that
were gunning for them Eventually theyll be making overtures to us
turning to us for help You wait and see

I am thinking again of Hitler Opperly interposed quietly On his
first half dozen big steps he had nothing but bluff His generals
were against him They knew they were in a cardboard fort Yet he won
every battle until the last Moreover he pressed on cutting Farquar
short the power of the Thinkers isnt based on what theyve got but
on what the world hasnt gotpeace honor a good conscience

The frontdoor knocker clanked Farquar answered it A skinny old man
with a radiation scar twisting across his temple handed him a tiny
cylinder Radiogram for you Willard He grinned across the hall at
Opperly When are you going to get a phone put in Mr Opperly

The physicist waved to him Next year perhaps Mr Berry

The old man snorted with goodhumored incredulity and trudged off

What did I tell you about the Thinkers making overtures Farquar
chortled suddenly Its come sooner than I expected Look at this

He held out the radiogram but the older man didnt take it Instead he
asked Whos it from Tregarron

No from Helmuth Theres a lot of sugar corn about mans future in
deep space but the real reason is clear They know that theyre going
to have to produce an actual nuclear rocket pretty soon and for that
theyll need our help

An invitation

Farquar nodded For this afternoon He noticed Opperlys anxious
though distant frown Whats the matter he asked Are you bothered
about my going Are you thinking it might be a trapthat after the
Maelzel question they may figure Im better rubbed out

The older man shook his head Im not afraid for your life Willard
Thats yours to risk as you choose No Im worried about other things
they might do to you

What do you mean Farquar asked

                                   

Opperly looked at him with a gentle appraisal Youre a strong and
vital man Willard with a strong mans prides and desires His voice
trailed off for a bit Then Excuse me Willard but wasnt there a
girl once A Miss Arkady

Farquars ungainly figure froze He nodded curtly face averted

And didnt she go off with a Thinker

If girls find me ugly thats their business Farquar said harshly
still not looking at Opperly Whats that got to do with this
invitation

Opperly didnt answer the question His eyes got more distant Finally
he said In my day we had it a lot easier A scientist was an
academician cushioned by tradition

Willard snorted Science had already entered the era of the police
inspectors with laboratory directors and political appointees stifling
enterprise

Perhaps Opperly agreed Still the scientist lived the safe
restricted highly respectable life of a university man He wasnt
exposed to the temptations of the world

Farquar turned on him Are you implying that the Thinkers will somehow
be able to buy me off

Not exactly

You think Ill be persuaded to change my aims Farquar demanded
angrily

Opperly shrugged his helplessness No I dont think youll change
your aims

Clouds encroaching from the west blotted the parallelogram of sunlight
between the two men

                                   

As the slideway whisked him gently along the corridor toward his
apartment Jorj was thinking of his spaceship For a moment the
silverwinged vision crowded everything else out of his mind

Just think a spaceship with sails He smiled a bit marveling at the
paradox

Direct atomic power Direct utilization of the force of the flying
neutrons No more ridiculous business of using a reactor to drive a
steam engine or boil off something for a jet exhaustprocesses that
were as primitive and wasteful as burning gunpowder to keep yourself
warm

Chemical jets would carry his spaceship above the atmosphere Then
would come the thrilling order Set sail for Mars The vast umbrella
would unfold and open out around the stern its rear or Earthward side
a gleaming expanse of radioactive ribbon perhaps only an atom thick
and backed with a material that would reflect neutrons Atoms in the
ribbon would split blasting neutrons astern at fantastic velocities
Reaction would send the spaceship hurtling forward

In airless space the expanse of sails would naturally not retard the
ship More radioactive ribbon manufactured as needed in the ship
itself would feed out onto the sail as that already there became
exhausted

A spaceship with direct nuclear driveand he a Thinker had
conceived it completely except for the technical details Having
strengthened his mind by hard years of somnolearning mindcasting
memorystraightening and sensory training he had assured himself
of the executive power to control the technicians and direct their
specialized abilities Together they would build the true Mars rocket

But that would only be a beginning They would build the true Mind
Bomb They would build the true Selective Microbe Slayer They would
discover the true laws of ESP and the inner life They would evenhis
imagination hesitated a moment then strode boldly forwardbuild the
true Maizie

And then  then the Thinkers would be on even terms with the
scientists Rather theyd be far ahead No more deception

He was so exalted by this thought that he almost let the slideway carry
him past his door He stepped inside and called Caddy He waited a
moment then walked through the apartment but she wasnt there

                                   

Confound the girl he couldnt help thinking This morning when she
should have made herself scarce shed sprawled about sleeping Now
when he felt like seeing her when her presence would have added a
pleasant final touch to his glowing mood she chose to be absent He
really should use his hypnotic control on her he decided and again
there sprang into his mind the worda pet form of her namethat would
send her into obedient trance

No he told himself again that was to be reserved for some moment
of crisis or desperate danger when he would need someone to strike
suddenly and unquestioningly for himself and mankind Caddy was merely
a wilful and rather silly girl incapable at present of understanding
the tremendous tensions under which he operated When he had time for
it he would train her up to be a fitting companion without hypnosis

Yet the fact of her absence had a subtly disquieting effect It shook
his perfect selfconfidence just a fraction He asked himself if
hed been wise in summoning the rocket physicists without consulting
Tregarron

But this mood too he conquered quickly Tregarron wasnt his
boss but just the Thinkers most clever salesman an expert in the
mumbojumbo so necessary for social control in this chaotic era He
himself Jorj Helmuth was the real leader in theoretics and allover
strategy the mind behind the mind behind Maizie

He stretched himself on the bed almost instantly achieved maximum
relaxation turned on the somnolearner and began the two hour rest he
knew would be desirable before the big conference

                                   

Jan Tregarron had supplemented his shorts with pink coveralls but he
was still drinking beer He emptied his glass and lifted it a lazy
inch The beautiful girl beside him refilled it without a word and went
on stroking his forehead

Caddy he said reflectively without looking at her theres a
little job I want you to do Youre the only one with the proper
background The point is it will take you away from Jorj for some
time

Id welcome it she said with decision Im getting pretty sick of
watching his pushups and all his other mind and muscle stunts And
that damn somnolearner of his keeps me awake

Tregarron smiled Im afraid Thinkers make pretty sad sweethearts

Not all of them she told him returning his smile tenderly

He chuckled Its about one of those rocket physicists in the list you
brought me A fellow named Willard Farquar

Caddy didnt say anything but she stopped stroking his forehead

Whats the matter he asked You knew him once didnt you

Yes she replied and then added with surprising feeling The big
ugly ape

Well hes an ape whose services we happen to need I want you to be
our contact girl with him

She took her hands away from his forehead Look Jan she said I
wouldnt like this job

I thought he was very sweet on you once

Yes as he never grew tired of trying to demonstrate to me The
clumsy overgrown bumbling baby The mans disgusting Jan His
approach to a woman is a child wanting candy and enraged because
Mama wont produce it on the instant I dont mind Jorjhes just
a pipsqueak and it amuses me to see how he frustrates himself But
Willard is

 a bit frightening Tregarron finished for her

No

Of course youre not afraid Tregarron purred Youre our beautiful
clever Caddy who can do anything she wants with any man and without
whose

Look Jan this is different she began agitatedly

 and without whose services wed have got exactly nowhere Clever
subtle Caddy whose most charming attainment in the everappreciative
eyes of Papa Jan is her ability to handle every man in the neatest way
imaginable and without a trace of real feeling Kitty Kaddy who

Very well she said with a sigh Ill do it

Of course you will Jan said drawing her hands back to his
forehead And youll begin right away by getting into your nicest
sugarandcream war clothes You and I are going to be the welcoming
committee when that ape arrives this afternoon

But what about Jorj Hell want to see Willard

Thatll be taken care of Jan assured her

And what about the other dozen rocket physicists Jorj asked to come

Dont worry about them

                                   

The President looked inquiringly at his secretary across his littered
desk in his homey study at White House Jr So Opperly didnt have any
idea how that odd question about Maizie turned up in Section Five

His secretary settled his paunch and shook his head Or claimed not
to Perhaps hes just the absentminded prof perhaps something else
The old feud of the physicists against the Thinkers may be getting hot
again Therell be further investigation

The President nodded He obviously had something uncomfortable on his
mind He said uneasily Do you think theres any possibility of it
being true

What asked the secretary guardedly

That peculiar hint about Maizie

The secretary said nothing

Mind you I dont think there is the President went on hurriedly
his face assuming a sorrowful scowl I owe a lot to the Thinkers
both as a private person and as a public figure Lord a man has to
lean on something these days But just supposing it were true he
hesitated as before uttering blasphemythat there was a man inside
Maizie what could we do

The secretary said stolidly The Thinkers won our last election They
chased the Commies out of Iran We brought them into the Inner Cabinet
Weve showered them with public funds He paused We couldnt do a
damn thing

The President nodded with equal conviction and not very happily
summed up So if anyone should go up against the Thinkersand Im
afraid I wouldnt want to see that happen whatevers trueit would
have to be a scientist

                                   

Willard Farquar felt his weight change the steps under his feet into
an escalator He cursed under his breath but let them carry him a
defiant hulk up to the tall and mystic blue portals which silently
parted when he was five meters away The escalator changed to a
slideway and carried him into a softly gleaming highdomed room
rather like the antechamber of a temple

Martian peace to you Willard Farquar an invisible voice intoned
You have entered the Thinkers Foundation Please remain on the
slideway

I want to see Jorj Helmuth Willard growled loudly

The slideway carried him into the mouth of a corridor and paused A
dark opening dilated on the wall May we take your hat and coat a
voice asked politely After a moment the request was repeated with the
addition of Just pass them through

Willard scowled then fought his way out of his shapeless coat and
passed it and his hat through in a lump Instantly the opening
contracted imprisoning his wrists and he felt his hands being washed
on the other side of the wall

He gave a great jerk which failed to free his hands from the snugly
padded gyves Do not be alarmed the voice advised him It is only
an esthetic measure As your hands are laved invisible radiations are
slaughtering all the germs in your body while more delicate emanations
are producing a benign rearrangement of your emotions

The rather amateurish curses Willard was gritting between his teeth
became more sulfurous His sensations told him that a towel of some
sort was being applied to his hands He wondered if he would be
subjected to a facewashing and even greater indignities Then just
before his wrists were released he feltfor a moment only but
unmistakablythe soft touch of a girls hand

That touch like the mysterious sweet chink of a bell in darkness
brought him a sudden feeling of excitement wonder

Yet the feeling was as fleeting as that caused by a lurid
advertisement for as the slideway began to move again carrying him
past a series of depthpictures and inscriptions celebrating the
Thinkers achievements his mood of bitter exasperation returned
doubled This place he told himself was a plague spot of the disease
of magic in an enfeebled and easily infected world He reminded himself
that he was not without resourcesthe Thinkers must fear or need him
whether because of the Maelzel question or the necessity of producing
a nuclear power spaceship He felt his determination to smash them
reaffirmed

                                   

The slideway having twice turned into an escalator veered toward
an opalescent door which opened as silently as the one below The
slideway stopped at the threshold Momentum carried him a couple of
steps into the room He stopped and looked around

The place was a sybarites modernistic dream Spongecarpeting thick
as a mattress and topped with down Hassocks and couches that looked
buttersoft A domed ceiling of deep glossy blue mimicking the night
sky with the constellations tooled in silver A wall of niches crammed
with statuettes of languorous men women beasts A selfservice bar
with a score of golden spigots A depthTVscreen simulating a great
crystal ball Here and there barbaric studs of hammered gold that might
have been pushbuttons A low table set for three with exquisite ware
of crystal and gold An everchanging scent of resins and flowers

A smiling fat man clad in pearl gray sports clothes came through one
of the curtained archways Willard recognized Jan Tregarron from his
pictures but did not at once offer to speak to him Instead he let his
gaze wander with an ostentatious contempt around the crammed walls
take in the bar and the set table with its many wine glasses and
finally return to his host

And where he asked with harsh irony are the dancing girls

The fat mans eyebrows rose In there he said innocently indicating
the second archway The curtains parted

Oh I am sorry the fat man apologized There seems to be only one
on duty I hope that isnt too much at variance with your tastes

She stood in the archway demure and lovely in an offthebosom frock
of pale blue skylon edged in mutated mink She was smiling the first
smile that Willard had ever had from her lips

Mr Willard Farquar the fat man murmured Miss Arkady Simms

                                   

Jorj Helmuth turned from the conference table with its dozen empty
chairs to the two mousily pretty secretaries

No word from the door yet Master one of them ventured to say

Jorj twisted in his chair though hardly uncomfortably since it was
a beautiful pneumatic job His nervousness at having to face the
twelve rocket physicistsa feeling which he had to admit had been
unexpectedly greatwas giving way to impatience

Whats Willard Farquars phone he asked sharply

One of the secretaries ran through a clutch of desk tapes then spent
some seconds whispering into her throatmike and listening to answers
from the softspeaker

He lives with Morton Opperly who doesnt have one she finally told
Jorj in scandalized tones

Let me see the list Jorj said Then after a bit Try Dr Welcomes
place

This time there were results Within a quarter of a minute he was
handed a phone which he hung expertly on his shoulder

This is Dr Asa Welcome a reedy voice told him

This is Helmuth of the Thinkers Foundation Jorj said icily Did
you get my communication

The reedy voice became anxious and placating Why yes Mr Helmuth I
did Very glad to get it too Sounded most interesting Very eager to
come But

Yes

Well I was just about to hop in my coptermy sons copterwhen
the other note came

What other note

Why the note calling the meeting off

I sent no other note

The other voice became acutely embarrassed But I considered it to be
from you  or just about the same thing I really think I had the
right to assume that

How was it signed Jorj rapped

Mr Jan Tregarron

Jorj broke the connection He didnt move until a low sound shattered
his abstraction and he realized that one of the girls was whispering
a call to the door He handed back the phone and dismissed them They
went in a rustle of jackets and skirtlets hesitating at the doorway
but not quite daring to look back

He sat motionless a minute longer Then his hand crept fretfully
onto the table and pushed a button The room darkened and a long
section of wall became transparent revealing a dozen silvery models
of spaceships beautifully executed He quickly touched another the
models faded and the opposite wall bloomed with an animated cartoon
that portrayed with charming humor and detail the designing and
construction of a neutrondrive spaceship A third button and a
depthpicture of deep starspeckled space opened behind the cartoon
showing a section of Earths surface and in the far distance the tiny
ruddy globe of Mars Slowly a tiny rocket rose from the section of
Earth and spread its silvery sails

                                   

He switched off the pictures keeping the room dark By a faint
table light he dejectedly examined his organizational charts for the
neutrondrive project the long list of books he had boned up on by
somnolearning the concealed table of physical constants and all sorts
of other crucial details about rocket physicsa cleverly condensed
encyclopedic pony to help out his memory on technical points that
might have arisen in his discussion with the experts

He switched out all the lights and slumped forward blinking his eyes
and trying to swallow the lump in his throat In the dark his memory
went seeping back back to the day when his math teacher had told him
very superciliously that the marvelous fantasies he loved to read
and hoarded by his bed werent real science at all but just a kind of
lurid pretense He had so wanted to be a scientist and the teachers
contempt had cast a damper on his ambition

And now that the conference was canceled would he ever know that it
wouldnt have turned out the same way today That his somnolearning
hadnt taken That his pony wasnt good enough That his ability to
handle people extended only to credulous farmer Presidents and mousy
girls in skirtlets Only the test of meeting the experts would have
answered those questions

Tregarron was the one to blame Tregarron with his sly tyrannical
ways Tregarron with his fear of losing the future to men who really
understood theoretics and could handle experts Tregarron so used to
working by deception that he couldnt see when it became a fault and a
crime Tregarron who must now be shown the light  or failing that
against whom certain steps must be taken

For perhaps half an hour Jorj sat very still thinking Then he turned
to the phone and after some delay got his party

What is it now Jorj Caddy asked impatiently Please dont bother
me with any of your moods because Im tired and my nerves are on edge

He took a breath When steps may have to be taken he thought one
must hold an agent in readiness Caddums he intoned hypnotically
vibrantly Caddums

The voice at the other end had instantly changed become submissive
sleepy suppliant

Yes Master

                                   

Morton Opperly looked up from the sheet of neatly penned equations
at Willard Farquar who had somehow acquired a measure of poise He
neither lumbered restlessly nor grimaced He removed his coat with
a certain dignity and stood solidly before his mentor He smiled
Granting that he was a bear one might guess he had just been fed

You see he said They didnt hurt me

They didnt hurt you Opperly asked softly

Willard slowly shook his head His smile broadened

Opperly put down his pen folded his hands And youre as determined
as ever to expose and smash the Thinkers

Of course The menacing growl came back into the bears voice except
that it was touched with a certain pleased luxuriousness Only from
now on I wont be teasing the zoo animals and I wont embarrass you
by asking any more Maelzel questions I have reached the objective at
which those tactics were aimed After this I shall bore from within

Bore from within Opperly repeated frowning Now where have I heard
that phrase before His brow cleared Oh yes he said listlessly
Do I understand that you are becoming a Thinker Willard

The other gave him a faintly pitying smile and stretched himself on the
couch gazed at the ceiling All his movements were deliberate easy

Certainly Thats the only realistic way to smash them Rise high
in their councils Outtrick all their trickeries Organize a fifth
column Then strike

The end justifying the means of course Opperly said

Of course As surely as the desire to stand up justifies your
disturbing the air over your head All action in this world is nothing
but means

Opperly nodded abstractedly I wonder if anyone else ever became a
Thinker for those same reasons I wonder if being a Thinker doesnt
simply mean that youve decided you have to use lies and tricks as your
chief method

                                   

Willard shrugged Could be There was no longer any doubt about the
pitying quality of his smile

Opperly stood up squaring together his papers So youll be working
with Helmuth

Not Helmuth Tregarron The bears smile became cruel Im afraid
that Helmuths career as a Thinker is going to have quite a setback

Helmuth Opperly mused Morgenschein once told me a bit about him
A man of some idealism despite his affiliations Best of a bad lot
Incidentally is he the one with whom

 Miss Arkady Simms ran off Willard finished without any
embarrassment Yes that was Helmuth But thats all going to be
changed now

Opperly nodded Goodby Willard he said

Willard quickly heaved himself up on an elbow Opperly looked at him
for about five seconds then without a word walked out of the room

                                   

The only obvious furnishings in Jan Tregarrons office were a
flattopped desk and a few chairs Tregarron sat behind the desk the
top of which was completely bare He looked almost bored except that
his little eyes were smiling Jorj Helmuth sat across the desk from
him a few feet back erect and grimfaced while shadowy in the muted
light Caddy stood against the wall behind Tregarron She still wore
the furtrimmed skylon frock shed put on that afternoon She took no
part in the conversation seemed almost unaware of it

So you just went ahead and canceled the conference without consulting
me Jorj was saying

You called it without consulting me Tregarron playfully wagged a
finger Shouldnt do that sort of thing Jorj

But I tell you I was completely prepared I was absolutely sure of my
ground

I know I know Tregarron said lightly But its not the right time
for it Im the best judge of that

When will be the right time

Tregarron shrugged Look here Jorj he said every man should stick
to his trade to his forte Technology isnt ours

Jorjs lips thinned But you know as well as I do that we are going to
have to have a nuclear spaceship and actually go to Mars someday

Tregarron lifted his eyebrows Are we

Yes Just as were going to have to build a real Maizie Everything
weve done until now have been emergency measures

Really

Jorj stared at him Look here Jan he said gripping his knees with
his hands you and I are going to have to talk things through

Are you quite sure of that Jans voice was very cool I have a
feeling that it might be best if you said nothing and accepted things
as they are

No

Very well Tregarron settled himself in his chair

I helped you organize the Thinkers Jorj said and waited At least
I was your first partner

Tregarron barely nodded

Our basic idea was that the time had come to apply science to the life
of man on a large scale to live rationally and realistically The
only things holding the world back from this allimportant step were
the ignorance superstition and inertia of the average man and the
stuffiness and lack of enterprise of the academic scientiststheir
worship of facts even when facts were clearly dangerous

Yet we knew that in their deepest hearts the average man and
the professionals were both on our side They wanted the new
world visualized by science They wanted the simplifications and
conveniences the glorious adventures of the human mind and body They
wanted the trips to Mars and into the depths of the human psyche they
wanted the robots and the thinking machines All they lacked was the
nerve to take the first big stepand that was what we supplied

It was no time for half measures for slow and sober plodding The
world was racked by wars and neurosis in danger of falling into the
foulest hands What was needed was a tremendous and thrilling appeal
to the human imagination an Earthshaking affirmation of the power of
science for good

But the men who provided that appeal and affirmation couldnt afford
to be cautious They wouldnt check and double check They couldnt
wait for the grudging and jealous approval of the professionals They
had to use stunts tricks fakesanything to get over the big point
Once that had been done once mankind was headed down the new road it
would be easy enough to give the average man the necessary degree of
insight to heal the breach with the professionals to make good in
actuality what had been made good only in pretense

Have I stated our position fairly

                                   

Tregarrons eyes were hooded Youre the one whos telling it

On those general assumptions we established our hold on susceptible
leaders and the mob Jorj went on We built Maizie and the Mars
rocket and the Mind Bomb We discovered the wisdom of the Martians We
sold the people on the science that the professionals had been too
hightoned to advertise or bring into the market place

But now that weve succeeded now that weve made the big point now
that Maizie and Mars and science do rule the average human imagination
the time has come to take the second big step to let accomplishment
catch up with imagination to implement fantasy with fact

Do you suppose Id ever have gone into this with you if it hadnt
been for the thought of that second big step Why Id have felt dirty
and cheap a mere charlatanexcept for the sure conviction that
someday everything would be set right Ive devoted my whole life to
that conviction Jan Ive studied and disciplined myself using every
scientific means at my disposal so that I wouldnt be found lacking
when the day came to heal the breach between the Thinkers and the
professionals Ive trained myself to be the perfect liaison man for
the job

Jan the days come and Im the man I know youve been concentrating
on other aspects of our work you havent had time to keep up with my
side of it But Im sure that as soon as you see how carefully Ive
prepared myself how completely practical the neutrondrive rocket
project is youll beg me to go ahead

Tregarron smiled at the ceiling for a moment Your general idea isnt
so bad Jorj but your time scale is out of whack and your judgment is
a joke Oh yes Every revolutionary wants to see the big change take
place in his lifetime Tcha Its as if he were watching evolutionary
vaudeville and wanted the ApetoMan Act over in twenty minutes

Time for the second big step Jorj the average mans exactly what
he was ten years ago except that hes got a new god More than
ever he thinks of Mars as a Hollywood paradise with wise men and
yummy princesses Maizie is Mama magnified a million times As for
professional scientists theyre more jealous and stuffy than ever All
theyd like to do is turn the clock back to a genteel dream world of
quiet quadrangles and caps and gowns where every commoner bows to the
passing scholar

Maybe in ten thousand years well be ready for the second big step
Maybe Meanwhile as should be the clever will rule the stupid for
their own good The realists will rule the dreamers Those with free
hands will rule those who have deliberately handcuffed themselves with
taboos

Secondly your judgment Did you actually think you could have bossed
those professionals kept your mental footing in the intellectual
melee You a nuclear physicist A rocket scientist Why itsTake
it easy now boy and listen to me Theyd have torn you to pieces in
twenty minutes and glad of the chance You baffle me Jorj You know
that Maizie and the Mars rocket and all that are fakes yet you believe
in your somnolearning and consciousnessexpansion and optimismpumping
like the veriest yokel I wouldnt be surprised to hear youd taken up
ESP and hypnotism I think you should take stock of yourself and get a
new slant Its overdue

                                   

He leaned back Jorjs face had become a mask His eyes did not flicker
from Tregarrons yet there was a subtle change in his expression
Behind Tregarron Caddy swayed as if in a sudden gust of intangible
wind and took a silent step forward from the wall

Thats your honest opinion Jorj asked very quietly

Its more than that Tregarron told him just as unmelodramatically
Its orders

Jorj stood up purposefully Very well he said In that case I have
to tell you that

Casually but with no wasted motion Tregarron slipped an ultrasonic
pistol from under the desk and laid it on the empty top

No he said let me tell you something I was afraid this would
happen and I made preparations If youve studied your Nazi Fascist
and Soviet history you know what happens to old revolutionaries who
dont move with the times But Im not going to be too harsh I have a
couple of the boys waiting outside Theyll take you by copter to the
field then by jet to New Mex Bright and early tomorrow morning Jorj
youre leaving on a trip to Mars

Jorj hardly reacted to the words Caddy was two steps nearer Tregarron

I decided Mars would be the best place for you the fat man
continued The robot controls will be arranged so that your visit
to Mars lasts two years Perhaps in that time you will have learned
wisdom such as realizing that the big liar must never fall for his own
big lie

Meanwhile there will have to be a replacement for you I have in mind
a person who may prove peculiarly worthy to occupy your position with
all its perquisites A person who seems to understand that force and
desire are the motive powers of life and that anyone who believes the
big lie proves himself strictly a jerk

                                   

Caddy was standing behind Tregarron now her halfclosed sleepy eyes
fixed on Jorjs

His name is Willard Farquar You see I too believe in cooperating
with the scientists Jorj but by subversion rather than conference My
idea is to offer the hand of friendship to a selected few of themthe
hand of friendship with a nice big bribe in it He smiled You were
a good man Jorj for the early days when we needed a publicist
with catchy ideas about Mind Bombs ray guns plastic helmets fancy
sweaters space brassieres and all that other corn Now we can afford
a soldier

Jorj moistened his lips

Well have a neat explanation of whats happened to you Callers will
be informed that youve gone on an extended visit to imbibe the wisdom
of the Martians

Jorj whispered Caddums

Caddy leaned forward Her arms snaked down Tregarrons as if to
imprison his wrists But instead she reached out and took the
ultrasonic pistol and put it in Tregarrons right hand Then she looked
up at Jorj with eyes that were very bright

She said very sweetly and sympathetically Poor Superman
