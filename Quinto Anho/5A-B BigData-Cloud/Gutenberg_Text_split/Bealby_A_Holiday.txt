                               CHAPTER I
                      YOUNG BEALBY GOES TO SHONTS


                                   

The cat is the offspring of a cat and the dog of a dog but butlers and
ladys maids do not reproduce their kind They have other duties

So their successors have to be sought among the prolific and
particularly among the prolific on great estates Such are gardeners
but not undergardeners gamekeepers and coachmenbut not lodge people
because their years are too great and their lodges too small And among
those to whom this opportunity of entering service came was young
Bealby who was the stepson of Mr Darling the gardener of Shonts

Everyone knows the glories of Shonts Its faade Its two towers The
great marble pond The terraces where the peacocks walk and the lower
lake with the black and white swans The great park and the avenue The
view of the river winding away across the blue country And of the
Shonts Velasquezbut that is now in America And the Shonts Rubens
which is in the National Gallery And the Shonts porcelain And the
Shonts past history it was a refuge for the old faith it had priests
holes and secret passages And how at last the Marquis had to let Shonts
to the Laxtonsthe Peptonized Milk and Baby Soother peoplefor a long
term of years It was a splendid chance for any boy to begin his
knowledge of service in so great an establishment and only the natural
perversity of human nature can explain the violent objection young
Bealby took to anything of the sort He did He said he did not want to
be a servant and that he would not go and be a good boy and try his
very best in that state of life to which it had pleased God to call him
at Shonts On the contrary

He communicated these views suddenly to his mother as she was preparing
a steak and kidney pie in the bright little kitchen of the gardeners
cottage He came in with his hair all ruffled and his face hot and
distinctly dirty and his hands in his trousers pockets in the way he
had been repeatedly told not to

Mother he said Im not going to be a stewards boy at the house
anyhow not if you tell me to not till youre blue in the face So
thats all about it

This delivered he remained panting having no further breath left in
him

His mother was a thin firm woman She paused in her rolling of the dough
until he had finished and then she made a strong broadening sweep of
the rolling pin and remained facing him leaning forward on that
implement with her head a little on one side

You will do she said whatsoever your father has said you will do

E isnt my father said young Bealby

His mother gave a snapping nod of the head expressive of extreme
determination

Anyhow I aint going to do it said young Bealby and feeling the
conversation was difficult to sustain he moved towards the staircase
door with a view to slamming it

Youll do it said his mother right enough

You see whether I do said young Bealby and then got in his doorslam
rather hurriedly because of steps outside

Mr Darling came in out of the sunshine a few moments later He was a
large manypocketed earthywhiskered man with a cleanshaven
determined mouth and he carried a large pale cucumber in his hand

I tole him he said

What did he say asked his wife

Nuthin said Mr Darling

E says e wont said Mrs Darling

Mr Darling regarded her thoughtfully for a moment

I never see such a boy said Mr Darling Whyes got to


                                   

But young Bealby maintained an obstinate fight against the inevitable

He had no gift of lucid exposition I aint going to be a servant he
said I dont see what right people have making a servant of me

You got to be something said Mr Darling

Everybodys got to be something said Mrs Darling

Then let me be something else said young Bealby

I dessay youd like to be a gentleman said Mr Darling

I wouldnt mind said young Bealby

You got to be what your opportunities give you said Mr Darling

Young Bealby became breathless Why shouldnt I be an engine driver
he asked

All oily said his mother And getting yourself killed in an
accident And got to pay fines Youd like to be an engine driver

Or a soldier

Ooa Swaddy said Mr Darling decisively

Or the sea

With that weak stummik of yours said Mrs Darling

Besides which said Mr Darling its been arranged for you to go up
to the ouse the very first of next month And your box and everything
ready

Young Bealby became very red in the face I wont go he said very
faintly

You will said Mr Darling if I ave to take you by the collar and
the slack of your breeches to get you there


                                   

The heart of young Bealby was a coal of fire within his breast
asunassistedhe went across the dewy park up to the great house
whither his box was to follow him

He thought the world a rotten show

He also said apparently to two does and a fawn If you think Im going
to stand it you know youre JOLLYwell mistaken

I do not attempt to justify his prejudice against honourable usefulness
in a domestic capacity He had it Perhaps there is something in the air
of Highbury where he had spent the past eight years of his life that
leads to democratic ideals It is one of those new places where estates
seem almost forgotten Perhaps too there was something in the Bealby
strain

I think he would have objected to any employment at all Hitherto he had
been a remarkably free boy with a considerable gusto about his freedom
Why should that end The little village mixed school had been a soft job
for his Cockney wits and for a year and a half he had been top boy Why
not go on being top boy

Instead of which under threats he had to go across the sunlit corner
of the park through that slanting morning sunlight which had been so
often the prelude to golden days of leafy wanderings He had to go past
the corner of the laundry where he had so often played cricket with the
coachmans boys already swallowed up into the working world he had to
follow the laundry wall to the end of the kitchen and there where the
steps go down and underground he had to say farewell to the sunlight
farewell to childhood boyhood freedom He had to go down and along the
stone corridor to the pantry and there he had to ask for Mr Mergleson
He paused on the top step and looked up at the blue sky across which a
hawk was slowly drifting His eyes followed the hawk out of sight beyond
a cypress bough but indeed he was not thinking about the hawk he was
not seeing the hawk he was struggling with a last wild impulse of his
ferial nature Why not sling it his ferial nature was asking Why
not even nowdo a bunk

It would have been better for him perhaps and better for Mr Mergleson
and better for Shonts if he had yielded to the whisper of the Tempter
But his heart was heavy within him and he had no lunch And never a
penny One can do but a very little bunk on an empty belly Must was
written all over him He went down the steps

The passage was long and cool and at the end of it was a swing door
Through that and then to the left he knew one had to go past the
stillroom and so to the pantry The maids were at breakfast in the
stillroom with the door open The grimace he made in passing was
intended rather to entertain than to insult and anyhow a chap must do
something with his face And then he came to the pantry and into the
presence of Mr Mergleson

Mr Mergleson was in his shirtsleeves and generally dishevelled having
an early cup of tea in an atmosphere full of the bleak memories of
overnight He was an ample man with a large nose a vast under lip and
muttonchop sidewhiskers His voice would have suited a succulent
parrot He took out a gold watch from his waistcoat pocket and regarded
it Ten minutes past seven young man he said isnt seven oclock

Young Bealby made no articulate answer

Just stand there for a minute said Mr Mergleson and when Im at
libbuty Ill run through your duties And almost ostentatiously he gave
himself up to the enjoyment of his cup of tea

Three other gentlemen in deshabille sat at table with Mr Mergleson
They regarded young Bealby with attention and the youngest a
redhaired barefaced youth in shirtsleeves and a green apron was moved
to a grimace that was clearly designed to echo the scowl on young
Bealbys features

The fury that had been subdued by a momentary awe of Mr Mergleson
revived and gathered force Young Bealbys face became scarlet his eyes
filled with tears and his mind with the need for movement After allhe
wouldnt stand it He turned round abruptly and made for the door

Wheren earth you going to cried Mr Mergleson

Hes shy cried the second footman

Steady on cried the first footman and had him by the shoulder in the
doorway

Lemme go howled the new recruit struggling I wont be a blooming
servant I wont

Here cried Mr Mergleson gesticulating with his teaspoon bring im
to the end of the table there Whats this about a blooming servant

Bealby suddenly blubbering was replaced at the end of the table

May I ask whats this about a blooming servant asked Mr Mergleson

Sniff and silence

Did I understand you to say that you aint going to be a blooming
servant young Bealby

Yes said young Bealby

Thomas said Mr Mergleson just smack is ed Smack it rather
ard

Things too rapid to relate occurred So youd bite would you said
Thomas

Ah said Mr Mergleson Got im That one 

Just smack is ed once more said Mr Mergleson

And now you just stand there young man until Im at libbuty to attend
to you further said Mr Mergleson and finished his tea slowly and
eloquently

The second footman rubbed his shin thoughtfully

If I got to smack is ed much he said ed better change into his
slippers

Take him to is room said Mr Mergleson getting up See e washes
the grief and grubbiness off is face in the handwash at the end of the
passage and make him put on his slippers Then show im ow to lay the
table in the stewards room


                                   

The duties to which Bealby was introduced struck him as perplexingly
various undesirably numerous uninteresting and difficult to remember
and also he did not try to remember them very well because he wanted to
do them as badly as possible and he thought that forgetting would be a
good way of starting at that He was beginning at the bottom of the
ladder to him it fell to wait on the upper servants and the green
baize door at the top of the service staircase was the limit of his
range His room was a small wedgeshaped apartment under some steps
leading to the servants hall lit by a window that did not open and
that gave upon the underground passage He received his instructions in
a state of crumpled mutinousness but for a day his desire to be
remarkably impossible was more than counterbalanced by his respect for
the large able hands of the four manservants his seniors and by a
disinclination to be returned too promptly to the gardens Then in a
tentative manner he broke two plates and got his head smacked by Mr
Mergleson himself Mr Mergleson gave a staccato slap quite as powerful
as Thomass but otherwise different The hand of Mr Mergleson was large
and fat and he got his effects by dash Thomass was horny and lingered
After that young Bealby put salt in the teapot in which the housekeeper
made tea But that he observed she washed out with hot water before she
put in the tea It was clear that he had wasted his salt which ought to
have gone into the kettle

Next timethe kettle

Beyond telling him his duties almost excessively nobody conversed with
young Bealby during the long hours of his first day in service At
midday dinner in the servants hall he made one of the kitchenmaids
giggle by pulling faces intended to be delicately suggestive of Mr
Mergleson but that was his nearest approach to disinterested human
intercourse

When the hour for retirement cameGet out of it Go to bed you dirty
little Kicker said Thomas Weve had about enough of you for one
dayyoung Bealby sat for a long time on the edge of his bed weighing
the possibilities of arson and poison He wished he had some poison
Some sort of poison with a medieval manner poison that hurts before it
kills Also he produced a small penny pocketbook with a glazed black
cover and blue edges He headed one page of this Mergleson and entered
beneath it three black crosses Then he opened an account to Thomas who
was manifestly destined to be his principal creditor Bealby was not a
forgiving boy At the village school they had been too busy making him a
good Churchman to attend to things like that There were a lot of
crosses for Thomas

And while Bealby made these sinister memoranda downstairs Lady
Laxtonfor Laxton had bought a baronetcy for twenty thousand down to the
party funds and a tip to the whip over the Peptonized Milk
flotationLady Laxton a couple of floors above Bealbys ruffled head
mused over her approaching weekend party It was an important weekend
party The Lord Chancellor of England was coming Never before had she
had so much as a member of the Cabinet at Shonts He was coming and do
what she would she could not help but connect it with her very strong
desire to see the master of Shonts in the clear scarlet of a Deputy
Lieutenant Peter would look so well in that The Lord Chancellor was
coming and to meet him and to circle about him there were Lord John
Woodenhouse and Slinker Bond there were the Countess of Barracks and
Mrs Rampound Pilby the novelist with her husband Rampound Pilby
there was Professor Timbre the philosopher and there were four smaller
though quite good people who would run about very satisfactorily among
the others At least she thought they would run about very
satisfactorily amongst the others not imagining any evil of her cousin
Captain Douglas

All this good company in Shonts filled Lady Laxton with a pleasant
realization of progressive successes but at the same time one must
confess that she felt a certain diffidence In her heart of hearts she
knew she had not made this party It had happened to her How it might
go on happening to her she did not know it was beyond her control She
hoped very earnestly that everything would pass off well

The Lord Chancellor was as big a guest as any she had had One must grow
as one grows but stillbeing easy and friendly with him would be she
knew a tremendous effort Rather like being easy and friendly with an
elephant She was not good at conversation The task of interesting
people taxed her and puzzled her

It was Slinker Bond the whip who had arranged the whole
businessafter it must be confessed a hint from Sir Peter Laxton had
complained that the government were neglecting this part of the country
They ought to show up more than they do in the county said Sir Peter
and added almost carelessly I could easily put anybody up at Shonts
There were to be two select dinner parties and a large but still select
Sunday lunch to let in the countryside to the spectacle of the Laxtons
taking their new proper place at Shonts

It was not only the sense of her own deficiencies that troubled Lady
Laxton there were also her husbands excesses He hadit was no use
disguising itrather too much the manner of an employer He had a way of
getting how could one put itconfident at dinner and Mergleson
seemed to delight in filling up his glass Then he would contradict a
good deal She felt that Lord Chancellors however are the sort of men
one doesnt contradict

Then the Lord Chancellor was said to be interested in philosophya
difficult subject She had got Timbre to talk to him upon that Timbre
was a professor of philosophy at Oxford so that was sure to be all
right But she wished she knew one or two good safe things to say in
philosophy herself She had long felt the need of a secretary and now
she felt it more than ever If she had a secretary she could just tell
him what it was she wanted to talk about and he could get her one or two
of the right books and mark the best passages and she could learn it all
up

She fearedit was a worrying fearthat Laxton would say right out and
very early in the weekend that he didnt believe in philosophy He had
a way of saying he didnt believe in large things like thatart
philanthropy novels and so on Sometimes he said I dont believe in
all thisart or whatever it was She had watched peoples faces when he
had said it and she had come to the conclusion that saying you dont
believe in things isnt the sort of thing people say nowadays It was
wrong somehow But she did not want to tell Laxton directly that it was
wrong He would remember if she did but he had a way of taking such
things rather badly at the time She hated him to take things badly

If one could invent some little hint she whispered to herself

She had often wished she was better at hints

She was you see a gentlewoman modest kindly Her people were quite
good people Poor of course But she was not clever she was anything
but clever And the wives of these captains of industry need to be very
clever indeed if they are to escape a magnificent social isolation They
get the titles and the big places and all that sort of thing people
dont at all intend to isolate them but there is nevertheless an
inadvertent avoidance

Even as she uttered these words If one could invent some little hint
Bealby down there less than forty feet away through the solid floor
below her feet and a little to the right was wetting his stump of pencil
as wet as he could in order to ensure a sufficiently emphatic fourteenth
cross on the score sheet of the doomed Thomas Most of the other
thirteen marks were done with such hard breathing emphasis that the
print of them went more than halfway through that little blueedged
book


                                   

The arrival of the weekend guests impressed Bealby at first merely as a
blessed influence that withdrew the four menservants into that unknown
world on the other side of the green baize door but then he learnt that
it also involved the appearance of five new persons two valets and
three maids for whom places had to be laid in the stewards room
Otherwise Lady Laxtons social arrangements had no more influence upon
the mind of Bealby than the private affairs of the Emperor of China
There was something going on up there beyond even his curiosity All he
heard of it was a distant coming and going of vehicles and some slight
talk to which he was inattentive while the coachman and grooms were
having a drink in the pantryuntil these maids and valets appeared They
seemed to him to appear suddenly out of nothing like slugs after rain
black and rather shiny sitting about inactively and quietly consuming
small matters He disliked them and they regarded him without affection
or respect

Who cared He indicated his feeling towards them as soon as he was out
of the stewards room by a gesture of the hand and nose venerable only
by reason of its antiquity

He had things more urgent to think about than strange valets and maids
Thomas had laid hands on him jeered at him inflicted shameful
indignities on him and he wanted to kill Thomas in some frightful
manner But if possible unobtrusively

If he had been a little Japanese boy this would have been an entirely
honourable desire It would have been Bushido and all that sort of
thing In the gardeners stepson however it isundesirable

Thomas on the other hand having remarked the red light of revenge in
Bealbys eye and being secretly afraid felt that his honour was
concerned in not relaxing his persecutions He called him Kicker and
when he did not answer to that name he called him Snorter Bleater
Snooks and finally tweaked his ear Then he saw fit to assume that
Bealby was deaf and that eartweaking was the only available method of
address This led on to the convention of a sign language whereby ideas
were communicated to Bealby by means of painful but frequently quite
ingeniously symbolical freedoms with various parts of his person Also
Thomas affected to discover uncleanliness in Bealbys head and succeeded
after many difficulties in putting it into a sinkful of lukewarm water

Meanwhile young Bealby devoted such scanty time as he could give to
reflection to debating whether it is better to attack Thomas suddenly
with a carving knife or throw a lighted lamp The large pantry inkpot of
pewter might be effective in its way he thought but he doubted whether
in the event of a charge it had sufficient stopping power He was also
curiously attracted by a long twopronged toastingfork that hung at the
side of the pantry fireplace It had reach

Over all these dark thoughts and illconcealed emotions Mr Mergleson
prevailed large yet speedy speedy yet exact parroting orders and
making plump gestures performing duties and seeing that duties were
performed

Matters came to a climax late on Saturday night at the end of a trying
day just before Mr Mergleson went round to lock up and turn out the
lights

Thomas came into the pantry close behind Bealby who greatly belated
through his own inefficiency was carrying a tray of glasses from the
stewards room applied an ungentle hand to his neck and ruffled up his
back hair in a smart and painful manner At the same time Thomas
remarked Burrrrh

Bealby stood still for a moment and then put down his tray on the table
and making peculiar sounds as he did so resorted very rapidly to the
toasting fork He got a prong into Thomass chin at the first prod

How swift are the changes of the human soul At the moment of his thrust
young Bealby was a primordial savage so soon as he saw this incredible
piercing of Thomass chinfor all the care that Bealby had taken it
might just as well have been Thomass eyehe moved swiftly through the
ages and became a simple Christian child He abandoned violence and
fled

The fork hung for a moment from the visage of Thomas like a twisted
beard of brass and then rattled on the ground

Thomas clapped his hand to his chin and discovered blood

You little He never found the right word which perhaps is just as
well instead he started in pursuit of Bealby

Bealbyin his sudden horror of his own actand Thomas fled headlong into
the passage and made straight for the service stairs that went up into a
higher world He had little time to think Thomas with a redsmeared
chin appeared in pursuit Thomas the avenger Thomas really roused
Bealby shot through the green baize door and the pursuing footman pulled
up only just in time not to follow him

Only just in time He had an instinctive instant anxious fear of great
dangers He heard something a sound as though the young of some very
large animal had squeaked feebly He had a glimpse of something black
and whiteand large

Then something some glass thing smashed

He steadied the green baize door which was wobbling on its brass hinges
controlled his panting breath and listened

A low rich voice wasejaculating It was not Bealbys voice it was the
voice of some substantial person being quietly but deeply angry They
were the ejaculations restrained in tone but not in quality of a ripe
and wellstored mindno boys thin stuff

Then very softly Thomas pushed open the doorjust widely enough to see
and as instantly let it fall back into place

Very gently and yet with an alert rapidity he turned about and stole
down the service stairs

His superior officer appeared in the passage below

Mr Mergleson he cried I sayMr Mergleson

Whats up said Mr Mergleson

Hes gone

Who

Bealby

Home This almost hopefully

No

Where

Up there I think he ran against somebody

Mr Mergleson scrutinized his subordinates face for a second Then he
listened intently both men listened intently

Have to fetch him out of that said Mr Mergleson suddenly preparing
for brisk activity

Thomas bent lower over the banisters

The Lord Chancellor he whispered with white lips and a sideways
gesture of his head

What about im said Mergleson arrested by something in the manner of
Thomas

Thomass whisper became so fine that Mr Mergleson drew nearer to catch
it and put up a hand to his ear Thomas repeated the last remark Hes
just through thereon the landingcursing and swearingorrible
thingsmore like a mad turkey than a human being

Wheres Bealby

He must almost ave run into im said Thomas after consideration

But nowwhere is he

Thomas pantomimed infinite perplexity

Mr Mergleson reflected and decided upon his line He came up the
service staircase lifted his chin and with an air of meek officiousness
went through the green door There was no one now on the landing there
was nothing remarkable on the landing except a broken tumbler but
halfway up the grand staircase stood the Lord Chancellor Under one arm
the great jurist carried a soda water syphon and he grasped a decanter
of whisky in his hand He turned sharply at the sound of the green baize
door and bent upon Mr Mergleson the most terrible eyebrows that ever
surely adorned a legal visage He was very red in the face and
savagelooking

Was it you he said with a threatening gesture of the decanter and
his voice betrayed a noble indignation Was it you who slapped me
behind

Slapped you behind me lord

Slapped me behind Dont I speakplainly

Isuch a libbuty me lord

Idiot I ask you a plain question

With almost inconceivable alacrity Mr Mergleson rushed up three steps
leapt forward and caught the syphon as it slipped from his lordships
arm

He caught it but at a price He overset and clasping it in his hands
struck his lordship first with the syphon on the left shin and then
butted him with a face that was still earnestly respectful in the knees
His lordships legs were driven sideways so that they were no longer
beneath his centre of gravity With a monosyllabic remark of a
topographical nature his lordship collapsed upon Mr Mergleson The
decanter flew out of his grasp and smashed presently with emphasis upon
the landing below The syphon escaping from the wreckage of Mr
Mergleson and drawn no doubt by a natural affinity rolled noisily from
step to step in pursuit of the decanter

It was a curious little procession that hurried down the great staircase
of Shonts that night First the whisky like a winged harbinger with the
pedestrian syphon in pursuit Then the great lawyer gripping the great
butler by the tails of his coat and punching furiously Then Mr
Mergleson trying wildly to be respectfuleven in disaster First the
Lord Chancellor dived over Mr Mergleson grappling as he passed then
Mr Mergleson attempting explanations was pulled backwards over the
Lord Chancellor then again the Lord Chancellor was for a giddy but
vindictive moment uppermost a second rotation and they reached the
landing

Bang There was a deafening report




                               CHAPTER II
                          A WEEKEND AT SHONTS


                                   

The weekend visit is a form of entertainment peculiar to Great Britain
It is a thing that could have been possible only in a land essentially
aristocratic and mellow in which even the observance of the sabbath has
become mellow At every London terminus on a Saturday afternoon the
outgoing trains have an unusually large proportion of first class
carriages and a peculiar abundance of richlooking dressingbags
provoke the covetous eye A discreet activity of valets and maids
mingles with the stimulated alertness of the porters One marks
celebrities in gay raiment There is an indefinable air of distinction
upon platform and bookstall Sometimes there are carriages reserved for
especially privileged parties There are greetings

And so you are coming too

No this time it is Shonts

The place where they found the Rubens Who has it now 

Through this cheerfully prosperous throng went the Lord Chancellor with
his high nose those eyebrows of his which he seemed to be able to furl
or unfurl at will and his expression of tranquil selfsufficiency He
was going to Shonts for his party and not for his pleasure but there
was no reason why that should appear upon his face He went along
preoccupied pretending to see nobody leaving to others the
disadvantage of the greeting In his right hand he carried a small
important bag of leather Under his left arm he bore a philosophical
work by Doctor MacTaggart three illustrated papers the Fortnightly
Review the days Times the Hibbert Journal Punch and two blue
books His Lordship never quite knew the limits set to what he could
carry under his arm His man Candler followed therefore at a suitable
distance with several papers that had already been dropped alert to
retrieve any further losses

At the large bookstall they passed close by Mrs Rampound Pilby who
according to her custom was feigning to be a member of the general
public and was asking the clerk about her last book The Lord Chancellor
saw Rampound Pilby hovering at hand and deftly failed to catch his eye
He loathed the Rampound Pilbys He speculated for a moment what sort of
people could possibly stand Mrs Pilbys vast pretensionseven from
Saturday to Monday One dinner party on her right hand had glutted him
for life He chose a corner seat took possession of both it and the
seat opposite it in order to have somewhere to put his feet left
Candler to watch over and pack in his hand luggage and went high up the
platform remaining there with his back to the worldrather like a
bigger more aquiline Napoleonin order to evade the great novelist

In this he was completely successful

He returned however to find Candler on the verge of a personal conflict
with a very fair young man in grey He was so fair as to be almost an
albino except that his eyes were quick and brown he was blushing the
brightest pink and speaking very quickly

These two places said Candler breathless with the badness of his
case are engaged

Oh vevery well said the very fair young man with his eyebrows and
moustache looking very pale by contrast have it so But do permit me
to occupy the middle seat of the carriage With a residuary interest in
the semigentlemans place

You little know young man whom you are calling a semigentleman
said Candler whose speciality was grammar

Here he is said the young gentleman

Which place will you have my Lord asked Candler abandoning his case
altogether

Facing said the Lord Chancellor slowly unfurling the eyebrows and
scowling at the young man in grey

Then Ill have the other said the very fair young man talking very
glibly He spoke with a quick low voice like one who forces himself to
keep going You see he said addressing the great jurist with the
extreme familiarity of the courageously nervous Ive gone into this
sort of thing before First mind you I have a far look for a vacant
corner Im not the sort to spoil sport But if there isnt a vacant
corner I look for traces of a semigentleman A semigentleman is one
who has a soft cap and not an umbrellahis friend in the opposite seat
has the umbrellaor he has an umbrella and not a soft cap or a
waterproof and not a bag or a bag and not a waterproof And a half
interest in a rug Thats what I call a semigentleman You see the
idea Sort of divided beggar Nothing in any way offensive

Sir said the Lord Chancellor interrupting in a voice of concentrated
passion I dont care a rap what you call a semigentleman Will
you get out of my way

Just as you please said the very fair young gentleman and going a
few paces from the carriage door he whistled for the boy with the
papers He was bearing up bravely

Pink un said the very fair young gentleman almost breathlessly
Black and White Whats all these others Athenum Sporting and
Dramatic Right O AndEh What Do I look the sort that buys a
Spectator You dont know My dear boy wheres your savoir faire


                                   

The Lord Chancellor was a philosopher and not easily perturbed His
severe manner was consciously assumed and never much more than
skindeep He had already furled his eyebrows and dismissed his
visavis from his mind before the train started He turned over the
Hibbert Journal and read in it with a large tolerance

Dimly on the outskirts of his consciousness the very fair young man
hovered as a trifling annoyance as something pink and hot rustling a
sheet of a discordant shade of pink as something that got in the way of
his legs and whistled softly some trivial cheerful air just to show how
little it cared Presently very soon this vague trouble would pass out
of his consciousness altogether

The Lord Chancellor was no mere amateur of philosophy His activities in
that direction were a part of his public reputation He lectured on
religion and sthetics He was a fluent Hegelian He spent his holidays
it was understood in the Absoluteat any rate in Germany He would
sometimes break into philosophy at dinner tables and particularly over
the desert and be more luminously incomprehensible while still
apparently sober than almost anyone An article in the Hibbert caught
and held his attention It attempted to define a new and doubtful
variety of Infinity You know of course that there are many sorts and
species of Infinity and that the Absolute is just the king among
Infinities as the lion is king among the Beasts

I say said a voice coming out of the world of Relativity and coughing
the cough of those who break a silence you arent going to Shonts are
you

The Lord Chancellor returned slowly to earth

Just seen your label said the very fair young man You seeIm
going to Shonts

The Lord Chancellor remained outwardly serene He reflected for a
moment And then he fell into that snare which is more fatal to great
lawyers and judges perhaps than to any other class of men the snare of
the crushing repartee One had come into his head nowa beauty

Then we shall meet there he said in his suavest manner

Wellrather

It would be a great pity said the Lord Chancellor with an effective
blandness using a kind of wry smile that he employed to make things
humorous it would be a great pity dont you think to anticipate that
pleasure

And having smiled the retort well home with his head a little on one
side he resumed with large leisurely movements the reading of his
Hibbert Journal

Got me there said the very fair young man belatedly looking boiled
to a turn and after a period of restlessness settled down to an
impatient perusal of Black and White

Theres a whole blessed weekend of course the young man remarked
presently without looking up from his paper and apparently pursuing some
obscure meditations

A vague uneasiness crept into the Lord Chancellors mind as he continued
to appear to peruse Out of what train of thought could such a remark
arise His weakness for crushing retort had a little betrayed him

It was however only when he found himself upon the platform of
Chelsome which as everyone knows is the station for Shonts and
discovered Mr and Mrs Rampound Pilby upon the platform looking
extraordinarily like a national monument and its custodian that the
Lord Chancellor began to realize that he was in the grip of fate and
that the service he was doing his party by weekending with the Laxtons
was likely to be not simply joyless but disagreeable

Well anyhow he had MacTaggart and he could always work in his own
room


                                   

By the end of dinner the Lord Chancellor was almost at the end of his
large but clumsy endurance he kept his eyebrows furled only by the most
strenuous relaxation of his muscles and within he was a sea of silent
blasphemies All sorts of little things had accumulated

He exercised an unusual temperance with the port and old brandy his host
pressed upon him feeling that he dared not relax lest his rage had its
way with him The cigars were quite intelligent at any rate and he
smoked and listened with a faintly perceptible disdain to the
conversation of the other men At any rate Mrs Rampound Pilby was out
of the room The talk had arisen out of a duologue that had preceded the
departure of the ladies a duologue of Timbres about apparitions and
the reality of the future life Sir Peter Laxton released from the eyes
of his wife was at liberty to say he did not believe in all this stuff
it was just thought transference and fancy and all that sort of thing
His declaration did not arrest the flow of feeble instances and
experiences into which such talk invariably degenerates His Lordship
remained carelessly attentive his eyebrows unfurled but drooping his
cigar upward at an acute angle he contributed no anecdotes content now
and then to express himself compactly by some brief sentence of pure
Hegelianmuch as a Mahometan might spit

Why come to that they say Shonts is haunted said Sir Peter I
suppose we could have a ghost here in no time if I chose to take it on
Rare place for a ghost too

The very fair young man of the train had got a name now and was Captain
Douglas When he was not blushing too brightly he was rather good
looking He was a distant cousin of Lady Laxtons He impressed the Lord
Chancellor as unabashed He engaged people in conversation with a
cheerful familiarity that excluded only the Lord Chancellor and even at
the Lord Chancellor he looked ever and again He pricked up his ears at
the mention of ghosts and afterwards when the Lord Chancellor came to
think things over it seemed to him that he had caught a curious glance
of the Captains bright little brown eye

What sort of ghost Sir Peter Chains Eh No

Nothing of that sort it seems I dont know much about it I wasnt
sufficiently interested No sort of spook that bangs about and does you
a mischief Whats its name Plundergeist

Poltergeist the Lord Chancellor supplied carelessly in the pause

Runs its hand over your hair in the dark Taps your shoulder All
nonsense But we dont tell the servants Sort of thing I dont believe
in Easily explainedwhat with panelling and secret passages and
priests holes and all that

Priests holes Douglas was excited

Where they hid Perfect rabbit warren Theres one going out from the
drawingroom alcove Quite a good room in its way But you knowa note
of wrath crept into Sir Peters voicethey didnt treat me fairly
about these priests holes I ought to have had a sketch and a plan of
these priests holes When a chap is given possession of a place he
ought to be given possession Well I dont know where half of them are
myself Thats not possession Else we might refurnish them and do them
up a bit I guess theyre pretty musty

Captain Douglas spoke with his eye on the Lord Chancellor Sure there
isnt a murdered priest in the place Sir Peter he asked

Nothing of the sort said Sir Peter I dont believe in these
priests holes Half of em never had priests in em Its all pretty
tidy rot I expectcome to the bottom of it

The conversation did not get away from ghosts and secret passages until
the men went to the drawingroom If it seemed likely to do so Captain
Douglas pulled it back He seemed to delight in these silly particulars
the sillier they were the more he was delighted

The Lord Chancellor was a little preoccupied by one of those irrational
suspicions that will sometimes afflict the most intelligent of men Why
did Douglas want to know all the particulars about the Shonts ghosts
Why every now and then did he glance with that odd expression at ones
facea glance half appealing and half amused Amused It was a strange
fancy but the Lord Chancellor could almost have sworn that the young
man was laughing at him At dinner he had had that feeling one has at
times of being talked about he had glanced along the table to discover
the Captain and a rather plain woman that idiot Timbres wife she
probably was with their heads together looking up at him quite
definitely and both manifestly pleased by something Douglas was telling
her

What was it Douglas had said in the train Something like a threat But
the exact words had slipped the Lord Chancellors memory

The Lord Chancellors preoccupation was just sufficient to make him a
little unwary He drifted into grappling distance of Mrs Rampound
Pilby Her voice caught him like a lasso and drew him in

Well and how is Lord Moggeridge now she asked

What on earth is one to say to such an impertinence

She was always like that She spoke to a man of the calibre of Lord
Bacon as though she was speaking to a schoolboy home for the holidays
She had an invincible air of knowing all through everybody It gave
rather confidence to her work than charm to her manner

Do you still go on with your philosophy she said

No shouted the Lord Chancellor losing all selfcontrol for the
moment and waving his eyebrows about madly no I go off with it

For your vacations Ah Lord Moggeridge how I envy you great lawyers
your long vacations Inever get a vacation Always we poor authors
are pursued by our creations sometimes its typescript sometimes its
proofs Not that I really complain of proofs I confess to a weakness
for proofs Sometimes alas its criticism Such undiscerning
criticism

The Lord Chancellor began to think very swiftly of some tremendous lie
that would enable him to escape at once without incivility from Lady
Laxtons drawingroom Then he perceived that Mrs Rampound Pilby was
asking him Is that the Captain Douglas or his brother whos in
love with the actress woman

The Lord Chancellor made no answer What he thought was Great Silly
Idiot How should I know

I think it must be the onethe one who had to leave Portsmouth in
disgrace because of the ragging scandal He did nothing there they say
but organize practical jokes Some of them were quite subtle practical
jokes Hes a cousin of our hostess that perhaps accounts for his
presence

The Lord Chancellors comment betrayed the drift of his thoughts Hed
better not try that sort of thing on here he said I
abominateclowning

Drawingroom did not last very long Even Lady Laxton could not miss the
manifest gloom of her principal guest and after the goodnights and
barley water and lemonade on the great landing Sir Peter led Lord
Moggeridge by the armhe hated being led by the arminto the small but
still spacious apartment that was called the study The Lord Chancellor
was now very thirsty he was not used to abstinence of any sort but Sir
Peters way of suggesting a drink roused such a fury of resentment in
him that he refused tersely and conclusively There was nobody else in
the study but Captain Douglas who seemed to hesitate upon the verge of
some familiar address and Lord Woodenhouse who was thirsty too and
held a vast tumbler of whisky and soda with a tinkle of ice in it on
his knee in a way annoying to a parched man The Lord Chancellor helped
himself to a cigar and assumed the middle of the fireplace with an air
of contentment but he could feel the selfcontrol running out of the
heels of his boots

Sir Peter after a quite unsuccessful invasion of his own hearthrugthe
Lord Chancellor stood like a rocksecured the big armchair stuck his
feet out towards his distinguished guest and resumed a talk that he had
been holding with Lord Woodenhouse about firearms Mergleson had as
usual been too attentive to his masters glass and the fine edge was
off Sir Peters deference I always have carried firearms he said
and I always shall Used properly they are a great protection Even in
the country how are you to know who youre going to run up
againstanywhen

But you might shoot and hit something said Douglas

Properly used I saidproperly used Whipping out a revolver and
shooting at a man thats not properly used Almost as bad as pointing
it at himwhich is pretty certain to make him fly straight at you If
hes got an ounce of pluck But I said properly used and I mean
properly used

The Lord Chancellor tried to think about that article on Infinities
while appearing to listen to this fools talk He despised revolvers
Armed with such eyebrows as his it was natural for him to despise
revolvers

Now Ive got some nice little barkers upstairs said Sir Peter Id
almost welcome a burglar just to try them

If you shoot a burglar said Lord Woodenhouse abruptly with a gust of
that illtemper that was frequent at Shonts towards bedtime when hes
not attacking you its murder

Sir Peter held up an offensively pacifying hand I know that he
said you neednt tell me that

He raised his voice a little to increase his already excessive
accentuations I said properly used

A yawn took the Lord Chancellor unawares and he caught it dexterously
with his hand Then he saw Douglas hastily pull at his little blond
moustache to conceal a smilegrinning ape What was there to smile at
The man had been smiling all the evening

Up to something

Now let me tell you said Sir Peter let me tell you the proper
way to use a revolver You whip it out and instantly let fly at the
ground You should never let anyone see a revolver ever before they hear
itsee You let fly at the ground first off and the concussion stuns
them It doesnt stun you You expect it they dont See There you
arefive shots left master of the situation

I think Sir Peter Ill bid you goodnight said the Lord Chancellor
allowing his eye to rest for one covetous moment on the decanter and
struggling with the devil of pride

Sir Peter made a gesture of extreme friendliness from his chair
expressive of the Lord Chancellors freedom to do whatever he pleased at
Shonts I may perhaps tell you a little story that happened once in
Morocco

My eyes wont keep open any longer said Captain Douglas suddenly
with a whirl of his knuckles into his sockets and stood up

Lord Woodenhouse stood up too

You see said Sir Peter standing also but sticking to his subject and
his hearer This was when I was younger than I am now you must
understand and I wasnt married Just mooching about a bit between
business and pleasure Under such circumstances one goes into parts of a
foreign town where one wouldnt go if one was older and wiser

Captain Douglas left Sir Peter and Woodenhouse to it

He emerged on the landing and selected one of the lighted candlesticks
upon the table Lord he whispered He grimaced in soliloquy and then
perceived the Lord Chancellor regarding him with suspicion and disfavour
from the ascending staircase He attempted ease For the first time
since the train incident he addressed Lord Moggeridge

I gather my lorddont believe in ghosts he said

No Sir said the Lord Chancellor I dont

They wont trouble me tonight

They wont trouble any of us

Fine old house anyhow said Captain Douglas

The Lord Chancellor disdained to reply He went on his way upstairs


                                   

When the Lord Chancellor sat down before the thoughtful fire in the fine
old panelled room assigned to him he perceived that he was too disturbed
to sleep This was going to be an infernal weekend The worst weekend
he had ever had Mrs Rampound Pilby maddened him Timbre who was a
Pragmatistwhich stands in the same relation to a Hegelian that a small
dog does to a large catexasperated him he loathed Laxton detested
Rampound Pilby and fearedas far as he was capable of fearing
anythingCaptain Douglas There was no refuge no soul in the house to
whom he could turn for consolation and protection from these others
Slinker Bond could talk only of the affairs of the party and the Lord
Chancellor being Lord Chancellor had long since lost any interest in
the affairs of the party Woodenhouse could talk of nothing The women
were astonishingly negligible There were practically no pretty women
There ought always to be pretty young women for a Lord Chancellor
pretty young women who can at least seem to listen

And he was atrociously thirsty

His room was supplied only with waterstuff you use to clean your
teethand nothing else

No good thinking about it

He decided that the best thing he could do to compose himself before
turning in would be to sit down at the writingtable and write a few
sheets of Hegelianabout that Infinity article in the Hibbert There is
indeed no better consolation for a troubled mind than the Hegelian
exercises they lift it aboveeverything He took off his coat and sat
down to this beautiful amusement but he had scarcely written a page
before his thirst became a torment He kept thinking of that great
tumbler Woodenhouse had heldsparkling golden cooland stimulating

What he wanted was a good stiff whisky and a cigar one of Laxtons
cigars the only good thing in his entertainment so far

And then Philosophy

Even as a student he had been a worker of the Teutonic typenever
abstemious

He thought of ringing and demanding these comforts and then it occurred
to him that it was a little late to ring for things Why not fetch them
from the study himself

He opened his door and looked out upon the great staircase It was a
fine piece of work that staircase Low broad dignified

There seemed to be nobody about The lights were still on He listened
for a little while and then put on his coat and went with a soft
swiftness that was still quite dignified downstairs to the study the
study redolent of Sir Peter

He made his modest collection

Lord Moggeridge came nearer to satisfaction as he emerged from the study
that night at Shonts than at any other moment during this illadvised
weekend In his pocket were four thoroughly good cigars In one hand he
held a cut glass decanter of whisky In the other a capacious tumbler
Under his arm with that confidence in the unlimited portative power of
his arm that nothing could shake he had tucked the syphon His soul
rested upon the edge of tranquillity like a bird that has escaped the
fowler He was already composing his next sentence about that new
variety of Infinity

Then something struck him from behind and impelled him forward a couple
of paces It was something hairy something in the nature he thought
afterwards of a worn broom And also there were two other things softer
and a little higher on each side

Then it was he made that noise like the young of some large animal

He dropped the glass in a hasty attempt to save the syphon

What in the name of Heaven he cried and found himself alone

Captain Douglas

The thought leapt to his mind

But indeed it was not Captain Douglas It was Bealby Bealby in panic
flight from Thomas And how was Bealby to know that this large richly
laden man was the Lord Chancellor of England Never before had Bealby
seen anyone in evening dress except a butler and so he supposed this
was just some larger finer kind of butler that they kept upstairs Some
larger finer kind of butler blocking the path of escape Bealby had
taken in the situation with the rapidity of a hunted animal The massive
form blocked the door to the left

In the playground of the village school Bealby had been preminent for
his dodging he moved as quickly as a lizard His little hands his
head poised with the skill of a practised butter came against that
mighty back and then Bealby had dodged into the study

But it seemed to Lord Moggeridge staggering over his broken glass and
circling about defensively that this fearful indignity could come only
from Captain Douglas Foolery Blup blup Sham Poltergeist
Imbeciles

He said as much believing that this young man and possibly confederates
were within hearing he said as muchhotly He went on to remark of an
unphilosophical tendency about Captain Douglas generally and about army
officers practical joking Laxtons hospitalities Shonts Thomas
you will remember heard him

Nothing came of it No answer not a word of apology

At last in a great dudgeon and with a kind of wariness about his back
the Lord Chancellor with things more spoilt for him than ever went on
his way upstairs

When the green baize door opened behind him he turned like a shot and
a large foolishfaced butler appeared Lord Moggeridge with a
sceptrelike motion of the decanter very quietly and firmly asked him a
simple question and then then the lunatic must needs leap up three
stairs and dive suddenly and upsettingly at his legs

Lord Moggeridge was paralyzed with amazement His legs were struck from
under him He uttered one brief topographical cry

To Sir Peter unfortunately it sounded like Help

For a few seconds the impressions that rushed upon Lord Moggeridge were
too rapid for adequate examination He had a compelling fancy to kill
butlers Things culminated in a pistol shot And then he found himself
sitting on the landing beside a disgracefully dishevelled manservant
and his host was running downstairs to them with a revolver in his hand

On occasion Lord Moggeridge could produce a tremendous voice He did so
now For a moment he stared panting at Sir Peter and then emphasized by
a pointing finger came the voice Never had it been so charged with
emotion

What does this mean you Sir he shouted What does this mean

It was exactly what Sir Peter had intended to say


                                   

Explanations are detestable things

And anyhow it isnt right to address your host as You Sir


                                   

Throughout the evening the persuasion had grown in Lady Laxtons mind
that all was not going well with the Lord Chancellor It was impossible
to believe he was enjoying himself But she did not know how to give
things a turn for the better Clever women would have known but she was
so convinced she was not clever that she did not even try

Thing after thing had gone wrong

How was she to know that there were two sorts of philosophyquite
different She had thought philosophy was philosophy But it seemed that
there were these two sorts if not more a round large sort that talked
about the Absolute and was scornfully superior and rather irascible and
a jabbypointed sort that called people Tender or Tough and was
generally much too familiar To bring them together was just mixing
trouble There ought to be little books for hostesses explaining these
things

Then it was extraordinary that the Lord Chancellor who was so
tremendously large and clever wouldnt go and talk to Mrs Rampound
Pilby who was also so tremendously large and clever Repeatedly Lady
Laxton had tried to get them into touch with one another Until at last
the Lord Chancellor had said distinctly and deliberately when she had
suggested his going across to the eminent writer God forbid Her
dream of a large clever duologue that she could afterwards recall with
pleasure was altogether shattered She thought the Lord Chancellor
uncommonly hard to please These werent the only people for him Why
couldnt he chat party secrets with Slinker Bond or say things to Lord
Woodenhouse You could say anything you liked to Lord Woodenhouse Or
talk with Mr Timbre Mrs Timbre had given him an excellent opening
she had asked Wasnt it a dreadful anxiety always to have the Great
Seal to mind He had simply grunted And then why did he keep on
looking so dangerously at Captain Douglas

Perhaps tomorrow things would take a turn for the better

One can at least be hopeful Even if one is not clever one can be
that

From such thoughts as these it was that this unhappy hostess was roused
by a sound of smashing glass a rumpus and a pistol shot

She stood up she laid her hand on her heart she said Oh and
gripped her dressingtable for support

After a long time and when it seemed that it was now nothing more than a
hubbub of voices in which her husbands could be distinguished clearly
she crept out very softly upon the upper landing

She perceived her cousin Captain Douglas looking extremely fair
and frail and untrustworthy in a much too gorgeous kimono
dressinggown of embroidered Japanese silk I can assure you my
lord he was saying in a strange highpitched deliberate voice
onmywordofhonourasasoldier that I know absolutely nothing
about it

Sure it wasnt all imagination my lord Sir Peter asked with his
inevitable infelicity

She decided to lean over the balustrading and ask very quietly and
clearly

Lord Moggeridge please is anything the matter


                                   

All human beings are egotists but there is no egotism to compare with
the egotism of the very young

Bealby was so much the centre of his world that he was incapable of any
interpretation of this shouting and uproar this smashing of decanters
and firing of pistol shots except in reference to himself He supposed
it to be a Hue and Cry He supposed that he was being huntedhunted by a
pack of great butlers hounded on by the irreparably injured Thomas The
thought of upstairs gentlefolks passed quite out of his mind He
snatched up a faked Syrian dagger that lay in the capacity of a paper
knife on the study table concealed himself under the chintz valance of
a sofa adjusted its rumpled skirts neatly and awaited the issue of
events

For a time events did not issue They remained talking noisily upon the
great staircase Bealby could not hear what was said but most of what
was said appeared to be flat contradiction

Perchance whispered Bealby to himself gathering courage perchance
we have eluded them A breathing space

At last a womans voice mingled with the others and seemed a little to
assuage them

Then it seemed to Bealby that they were dispersing to beat the house for
him Goodnight again then said someone

That puzzled him but he decided it was a blind He remained very
very still

He heard a clicking in the apartmentthe blue parlour it was
calledbetween the study and the diningroom Electric light

Then some one came into the study Bealbys eye was as close to the
ground as he could get it He was breathless he moved his head with an
immense circumspection The valance was translucent but not transparent
below it there was a crack of vision a strip of carpet the castors of
chairs Among these things he perceived feetnot ankles it did not go
up to that but just feet Large flattish feet A pair They stood
still and Bealbys hand lighted on the hilt of his dagger

The person above the feet seemed to be surveying the room or reflecting

Drunk Old fools either drunk or mad Thats about the truth of
it said a voice

Mergleson Angry but parroty and unmistakable

The feet went across to the table and there were faint sounds of
refreshment discreetly administered Then a moment of profound
stillness

Ah said the voice at last a voice renewed

Then the feet went to the passage door halted in the doorway There was
a double click The lights went out Bealby was in absolute darkness

Then a distant door closed and silence followed upon the dark

Mr Mergleson descended to a pantry ablaze with curiosity

The Lord Chancellors going dotty said Mr Mergleson replying to the
inevitable question Thats whats up 

I tried to save the blessed syphon said Mr Mergleson pursuing his
narrative and e sprang on me like a leppard I suppose e thought I
wanted to take it away from im Ed broke a glass already OwI
dont know There it was lying on the landing

Eres where e bit my and said Mr Mergleson

A curious little sideissue occurred to Thomas Wheres young Kicker
all this time he asked

Lord said Mr Mergleson all them other things they clean drove im
out of my ed I suppose es up there hiding somewhere

He paused His eye consulted the eye of Thomas

Es got behind a curtain or something said Mr Mergleson

Queer where e can ave got to said Mr Mergleson

Cant be bothered about im said Mr Mergleson

I expect hell sneak down to is room when things are quiet said
Thomas after reflection

No good going and looking for im now said Mr Mergleson Things
upstairsthey got to settle down

But in the small hours Mr Mergleson awakened and thought of Bealby and
wondered whether he was in bed This became so great an uneasiness that
about the hour of dawn he got up and went along the passage to Bealbys
compartment Bealby was not there and his bed had not been slept in

That sinister sense of gathering misfortunes which comes to all of us at
times in the small hours was so strong in the mind of Mr Mergleson
that he went on and told Thomas of this disconcerting fact Thomas woke
with difficulty and rather crossly but sat up at last alive to the
gravity of Mr Merglesons mood

If es found hiding about upstairs after all this upset said Mr
Mergleson and left the rest of the sentence to a sympathetic
imagination

Now its light said Mr Mergleson after a slight pause I think we
better just go round and ave a look for im Both of us

So Thomas clad himself provisionally and the two manservants went
upstairs very softly and began a series of furtive sweeping
movementsvery much in the spirit of Lord Kitcheners historical
sweeping movements in the Transvaalthrough the stately old rooms in
which Bealby must be lurking


                                   

Man is the most restless of animals There is an incessant urgency in
his nature He never knows when he is well off And so it was that
Bealbys comparative security under the sofa became presently too
irksome to be endured He seemed to himself to stay there for ages but
as a matter of fact he stayed there only twenty minutes Then with eyes
tempered to the darkness he first struck out an alert attentive head
then crept out and remained for the space of half a minute on all fours
surveying the indistinct blacknesses about him

Then he knelt up Then he stood up Then with arms extended and cautious
steps he began an exploration of the apartment

The passion for exploration grows with what it feeds upon Presently
Bealby was feeling his way into the blue parlour and then round by its
shuttered and curtained windows to the diningroom His head was now
full of the idea of some shelter more permanent less pervious to
housemaids than that sofa He knew enough now of domestic routines to
know that upstairs in the early morning was much routed by housemaids
He found many perplexing turns and corners and finally got into the
diningroom fireplace where it was very dark and kicked against some
fireirons That made his heart beat fast for a time Then groping on
past it he found in the darkness what few people could have found in
the day the stud that released the panel that hid the opening of the
way that led to the priest hole He felt the thing open and halted
perplexed In that corner there wasnt a ray of light For a long time
he was trying to think what this opening could be and then he concluded
it was some sort of back way from downstairs Well anyhow it was all
exploring With an extreme gingerliness he got himself through the
panel He closed it almost completely behind him

Careful investigation brought him to the view that he was in a narrow
passage of brick or stone that came in a score of paces to a spiral
staircase going both up and down Up this he went and presently
breathed cool night air and had a glimpse of stars through a narrow
slitlike window almost blocked by ivy Thenwhat was very
disagreeablesomething scampered

When Bealbys heart recovered he went on up again

He came to the priest hole a capacious cell six feet square with a
bench bed and a little table and chair It had a small door upon the
stairs that was open and a niche cupboard Here he remained for a time
Then restlessness made him explore a cramped passage he had to crawl
along it for some yards that came presently into a curious space with
wood on one side and stone on the other Then ahead most blessed thing
he saw light

He went blundering toward it and then stopped appalled From the other
side of this wooden wall to the right of him had come a voice

Come in said the voice A rich masculine voice that seemed scarcely
two yards away

Bealby became rigid Then after a long interval he movedas softly as he
could

The voice soliloquized

Bealby listened intently and then when all was still again crept
forward two paces more towards the gleam It was a peephole

The unseen speaker was walking about Bealby listened and the sound of
his beating heart mingled with the pad pad of slippered footsteps
Then with a brilliant effort his eye was at the chink All was still
again For a time he was perplexed by what he saw a large pink shining
dome against a deep greenish grey background At the base of the dome
was a kind of interrupted hedge brown and leafless

Then he realized that he was looking at the top of a head and two
enormous eyebrows The rest was hidden

Nature surprised Bealby into a penetrating sniff

Now said the occupant of the room and suddenly he was standing
upBealby saw a long hairy neck sticking out of a dressinggownand
walking to the side of the room I wont stand it said the great
voice I wont stand it Apes foolery

Then the Lord Chancellor began rapping at the panelling about his
apartment

Hollow It all sounds hollow

Only after a long interval did he resume his writing

All night long that rat behind the wainscot troubled the Lord
Chancellor Whenever he spoke whenever he moved about it was still
whenever he composed himself to write it began to rustle and blunder
Again and again it sniffedan annoying kind of sniff At last the Lord
Chancellor gave up his philosophical relaxation and went to bed turned
out the lights and attempted sleep but this only intensified his sense
of an uneasy sniffing presence close to him When the light was out it
seemed to him that this Thing whatever it was instantly came into the
room and set the floor creaking and snapping A Thing perpetually
attempting something and perpetually thwarted

The Lord Chancellor did not sleep a wink The first feeble infiltration
of day found him sitting up in bed wearily wrathful And now surely
someone was going along the passage outside

A great desire to hurt somebody very much seized upon the Lord
Chancellor Perhaps he might hurt that dismal farceur upon the
landing No doubt it was Douglas sneaking back to his own room after the
nights efforts

The Lord Chancellor slipped on his dressinggown of purple silk Very
softly indeed did he open his bedroom door and very warily peep out He
heard the soft pad of feet upon the staircase

He crept across the broad passage to the beautiful old balustrading
Down below he saw MerglesonMergleson againin a shameful
deshabillegoing like a snake like a slinking cat like an assassin
into the door of the study Rage filled the great mans soul Gathering
up the skirts of his dressinggown he started in a swift yet noiseless
pursuit

He followed Mergleson through the little parlour and into the
diningroom and then he saw it all There was a panel open and
Mergleson very cautiously going in Of course They had got at him
through the priest hole They had been playing on his nerves All night
they had been doing itno doubt in relays The whole house was in this
conspiracy

With his eyebrows spread like the wings of a fighting cock the Lord
Chancellor in five vast noiseless strides had crossed the intervening
space and gripped the butler by his collarless shirt as he was
disappearing It was like a hawk striking a sparrow Mergleson felt
himself clutched glanced over his shoulder and seeing that fierce
familiar face again close to his own pitiless vindictive lost all
sense of human dignity and yelled like a lost soul


                                   

Sir Peter Laxton was awakened from an uneasy sleep by the opening of the
dressingroom door that connected his room with his wifes

He sat up astonished and stared at her white face its pallor
exaggerated by the cold light of dawn

Peter she said Im sure theres something more going on

Something more going on

Somethingshouting and swearing

You dont mean

She nodded The Lord Chancellor she said in an awestricken whisper
Hes at it again Downstairs in the diningroom

Sir Peter seemed disposed at first to receive this quite passively Then
he flashed into extravagant wrath Im damned he cried jumping
violently out of bed if Im going to stand this Not if he was a
hundred Lord Chancellors Hes turning the place into a bally lunatic
asylum Onceone might excuse But to start in again Whats
that

They both stood still listening Faintly yet quite distinctly came the
agonized cry of some imperfectly educated personElp

Here Wheres my trousers cried Sir Peter Hes murdering Mergleson
There isnt a moment to lose


                                   

Until Sir Peter returned Lady Laxton sat quite still just as he had left
her on his bed aghast

She could not even pray

The sun had still to rise the room was full of that cold weak inky
light light without warmth knowledge without faith existence without
courage that creeps in before the day She waited In such a mood
women have waited for massacre

Downstairs a raucous shouting

She thought of her happy childhood upon the Yorkshire wolds before the
idea of weekend parties had entered her mind The heather The little
birds Kind things A tear ran down her cheek


                                   

Then Sir Peter stood before her again alive still but breathless and
greatly ruffled

She put her hands to her heart She would be brave

Yes she said Tell me

Hes as mad as a hatter said Sir Peter

She nodded for more She knew that

Has hekilled anyone she whispered

He looked uncommonly like trying said Sir Peter

She nodded her lips tightly compressed

Says Douglas will either have to leave the house or he does

ButDouglas

I know but he wont hear a word

But why Douglas

I tell you hes as mad as a hatter Got persecution mania People
tapping and bells ringing under his pillow all nightthat sort of
idea And furious I tell youhe frightened me He was awful Hes
given Mergleson a black eye Hit him you know With his fist Caught
him in the passage to the priest holehow they got there I dont
knowand went for him like a madman

But what has Douglas done

I know I asked him but he wont listen Hes just off his head
Says Douglas has got the whole household trying to work a ghost on him
I tell youhes off his nut

Husband and wife looked at each other

Of course if Douglas didnt mind just going off to oblige me said Sir
Peter at last

It might calm him he explained You see its all so infernally
awkward

Is he back in his room

Yes Waiting for me to decide about Douglas Walking up and down

For a little while their minds remained prostrate and inactive

Id been so looking forward to the lunch she said with a joyless
smile The county

She could not go on

You know said Sir Peter one thingIll see to it myself I wont
have him have a single drop of liquor more If we have to search his
room

What I shall say to him at breakfast she said I dont know

Sir Peter reflected Theres no earthly reason why you should be
brought into it at all Your line is to know nothing about it Show
him you know nothing about it Ask himask him if hes had a good
night




                              CHAPTER III
                             THE WANDERERS


                                   

Never had the gracious eastward face of Shonts looked more beautiful
than it did on the morning of the Lord Chancellors visit It glowed as
translucent as amber lit by flames its two towers were pillars of pale
gold It looked over its slopes and parapets upon a great valley of
mistbarred freshness through which the distant river shone like a snake
of light The southwest faade was still in the shadow and the ivy
hung from it darkly greener than the greenest green The stainedglass
windows of the old chapel reflected the sunrise as though lamps were
burning inside Along the terrace a pensive peacock trailed his sheathed
splendours through the dew

Amidst the ivy was a fuss of birds

And presently there was pushed out from amidst the ivy at the foot of
the eastward tower a little brownish buff thing that seemed as natural
there as a squirrel or a rabbit It was a heada ruffled human head It
remained still for a moment contemplating the calm spaciousness of
terrace and garden and countryside Then it emerged further and rotated
and surveyed the house above it Its expression was one of alert
caution Its natural freshness and innocence were a little marred by an
enormous transverse smudge a barsinister of smut and the elfin
delicacy of the left ear was festooned with a cobwebprobably a genuine
antique It was the face of Bealby

He was considering the advisability of leaving Shontsfor good

Presently his decision was made His hands and shoulders appeared
following his head and then a dusty but undamaged Bealby was running
swiftly towards the corner of the shrubbery He crouched lest at any
moment that pursuing pack of butlers should see him and give tongue In
another moment he was hidden from the house altogether and rustling his
way through a thicket of budding rhododendra After those dirty passages
the morning air was wonderfully sweetbut just a trifle hungry

Grazing deer saw Bealby fly across the park stared at him for a time
with great gentle unintelligent eyes and went on feeding

They saw him stop ever and again He was snatching at mushrooms that he
devoured forthwith as he sped on

On the edge of the beechwoods he paused and glanced back at Shonts

Then his eyes rested for a moment on the clump of trees through which
one saw a scrap of the head gardeners cottage a bit of the garden
wall

A physiognomist might have detected a certain lack of selfconfidence in
Bealbys eyes

But his spirit was not to be quelled Slowly joylessly perhaps but
with a grave determination he raised his hand in that prehistoric
gesture of the hand and face by which youth since ever there was youth
has asserted the integrity of its soul against established and
predominant things

Ketch me said Bealby


                                   

Bealby left Shonts about halfpast four in the morning He went westward
because he liked the company of his shadow and was amused at first by
its vast length By halfpast eight he had covered ten miles and he was
rather bored by his shadow He had eaten nine raw mushrooms two green
apples and a quantity of unripe blackberries None of these things
seemed quite at home in him And he had discovered himself to be wearing
slippers They were stout carpet slippers but still they were
slippersand the road was telling on them At the ninth mile the left
one began to give on the outer seam He got over a stile into a path
that ran through the corner of a wood and there he met a smell of
frying bacon that turned his very soul to gastric juice

He stopped short and sniffed the airand the air itself was sizzling

Oh Krikey said Bealby manifestly to the Spirit of the World This
is a bit too strong I wasnt thinking much before

Then he saw something bright yellow and bulky just over the hedge

From this it was that the sound of frying came

He went to the hedge making no effort to conceal himself Outside a
great yellow caravan with dainty little windows stood a largish dark
woman in a deerstalker hat a short brown skirt a large white apron and
spatterdashes among other things frying bacon and potatoes in a
frying pan She was very red in the face and the frying pan was
spitting at her as frying pans do at a timid cook

Quite mechanically Bealby scrambled through the hedge and drew nearer
this divine smell The woman scrutinized him for a moment and then
blinking and averting her face went on with her cookery

Bealby came quite close to her and remained noting the bits of potato
that swam about in the pan the jolly curling of the rashers the
dancing of the bubbles the hymning splash and splutter of the happy
fat

If it should ever fall to my lot to be cooked may I be fried in
potatoes and butter May I be fried with potatoes and good butter made
from the milk of the cow God send I am spared boiling the prison of
the pot the rattling lid the evil darkness the greasy water

I suppose said the lady prodding with her fork at the bacon I
suppose you call yourself a Boy

Yes miss said Bealby

Have you ever fried

I could miss

Like this

Better

Just lay hold of this handlefor its scorching the skin off my face I
am She seemed to think for a moment and added entirely

In silence Bealby grasped that exquisite smell by the handle he took
the fork from her hand and put his hungry eager nose over the seething
mess It wasnt only bacon there were onions onions giving itan
edge It cut to the quick of appetite He could have wept with the
intensity of his sensations

A voice almost as delicious as the smell came out of the caravan window
behind Bealbys head

Judy cried the voice

HereI meanits here I am said the lady in the deerstalker

Judyyou didnt take my stockings for your own by any chance

The lady in the deerstalker gave way to delighted horror Sssh
Mavourneen she criedshe was one of that large class of amiable women
who are more Irish than they need betheres a Boy here


                                   

There was indeed an almost obsequiously industrious and obliging Boy An
hour later he was no longer a Boy but the Boy and three friendly
women were regarding him with a merited approval

He had done the frying renewed a waning fire with remarkable skill and
dispatch reboiled a neglected kettle in the shortest possible time
laid almost without direction a simple meal very exactly set out
campstools and cleaned the frying pan marvellously Hardly had they
taken their portions of that appetizing savouriness than he had whipped
off with that implement gone behind the caravan busied himself there
and returned with the panglittering bright Himself if possible
brighter One cheek indeed shone with an animated glow

But wasnt there some of the bacon and stuff left asked the lady in
the deerstalker

I didnt think it was wanted Miss said Bealby So I cleared it up

He met understanding in her eye He questioned her expression

Maynt I wash up for you miss he asked to relieve the tension

He washed up swiftly and cleanly He had never been able to wash up to
Mr Merglesons satisfaction before but now he did everything Mr
Mergleson had ever told him He asked where to put the things away and
he put them away Then he asked politely if there was anything else he
could do for them Questioned he said he liked doing things You
havent said the lady in the deerstalker a taste for cleaning
boots

Bealby declared he had

Surely said a voice that Bealby adored tis an angel from heaven

He had a taste for cleaning boots This was an extraordinary thing for
Bealby to say But a great change had come to him in the last halfhour
He was violently anxious to do things any sort of things servile
things for a particular person He was in love

The owner of the beautiful voice had come out of the caravan she had
stood for a moment in the doorway before descending the steps to the
ground and the soul of Bealby had bowed down before her in instant
submission Never had he seen anything so lovely Her straight slender
body was sheathed in blue fair hair a little tinged with red poured
gloriously back from her broad forehead and she had the sweetest eyes
in the world One hand lifted her dress from her feet the other rested
on the lintel of the caravan door She looked at him and smiled

So for two years she had looked and smiled across the footlights to the
Bealby in mankind She had smiled now on her entrance out of habit She
took the effect upon Bealby as a foregone conclusion

Then she had looked to make sure that everything was ready before she
descended

How good it smells Judy she had said

Ive had a helper said the woman who wore spats

That time the blueeyed lady had smiled at him quite definitely

The third member of the party had appeared unobserved the irradiations
of the beautiful lady had obscured her Bealby discovered her about She
was bareheaded she wore a simple grey dress with a Norfolk jacket and
she had a pretty clear white profile under black hair She answered to
the name of Winnie The beautiful lady was Madeleine They made little
obscure jokes with each other and praised the morning ardently This is
the best place of all said Madeleine

All night said Winnie not a single mosquito

None of these three ladies made any attempt to conceal the sincerity of
their hunger or their appreciation of Bealbys assistance How good a
thing is appreciation Here he was doing with joy and pride and an
eager excellence the very services he had done so badly under the
cuffings of Mergleson and Thomas


                                   

And now Bealby having been regarded with approval for some moments and
discussed in tantalizing undertones was called upon to explain himself

Boy said the lady in the deerstalker who was evidently the leader
and still more evidently the spokeswoman of the party come here

Yes miss He put down the boot he was cleaning on the caravan step

In the first place know by these presents I am a married woman

Yes miss

And miss is not a seemly mode of address for me

No miss I mean Bealby hung for a moment and by the happiest of
accidents a scrap of his instruction at Shonts came up in his mind
No he said yourladyship

A great light shone on the spokeswomans face Not yet my child she
said not yet He hasnt done his duty by me I ama simple Mum

Bealby was intelligently silent

SayYes Mum

Yes Mum said Bealby and everybody laughed very agreeably

And now said the lady taking pleasure in her words know by these
presentsBy the bye what is your name

Bealby scarcely hesitated Dick Maltravers Mum he said and almost
added The Dauntless Daredevil of the Diamondfields Horse which was
the second title

Dick will do said the lady who was called Judy and added suddenly
and very amusingly You may keep the rest

These were the sort of people Bealby liked The right sort

Well Dick we want to know have you ever been in service

It was sudden But Bealby was equal to it Only for a day or two
missI mean Mumjust to be useful

Were you useful

Bealby tried to think whether he had been and could recall nothing but
the face of Thomas with the fork hanging from it I did my best Mum
he said impartially

And all that is over

Yes Mum

And youre at home again and out of employment

Yes Mum

Do you live near here

Noleastways not very far

With your father

Stepfather Mum Im a Norfan

Well how would you like to come with us for a few days and help with
things Sevenandsixpence a week

Bealbys face was eloquent

Would your stepfather object

Bealby considered I dont think he would he said

Youd better go round and ask him

Isupposeyes he said

And get a few things

Things Mum

Collars and things You neednt bring a great box for such a little
while

Yes Mum

He hovered rather undecidedly

Better run along now Our man and horse will be coming presently We
shant be able to wait for you long

Bealby assumed a sudden briskness and departed

At the gate of the field he hesitated almost imperceptibly and then
directed his face to the Sabbath stillness of the village

Perplexity corrugated his features The stepfathers permission
presented no difficulties but it was more difficult about the luggage

A voice called after him

Yes Mum he said attentive and hopeful Perhapssomehowthey wouldnt
want luggage

Youll want Boots Youll have to walk by the caravan you know Youll
want some good stout Boots

All right Mum he said with a sorrowful break in his voice He waited
a few moments but nothing more came He went onvery slowly He had
forgotten about the boots

That defeated him

It is hard to be refused admission to Paradise for the want of a
handbag and a pair of walkingboots


                                   

Bealby was by no means certain that he was going back to that caravan
He wanted to do so quite painfully but

Hed just look a fool going back without boots andnothing on earth
would reconcile him to the idea of looking a fool in the eyes of that
beautiful woman in blue

Dick he whispered to himself despondently Daredevil Dick A more
miserablelooking face you never set eyes on Its all up with your
little schemes Dick my boy You must get a bagand nothing on earth
will get you a bag

He paid little heed to the village through which he wandered He knew
there were no bags there Chance rather than any volition of his own
guided him down a side path that led to the nearly dry bed of a little
rivulet and there he sat down on some weedy grass under a group of
willows It was an untidy place that needed all the sunshine of the
morning to be tolerable one of those places where stinging nettles take
heart and people throw old kettles broken gallipots jaded gravel
grass cuttings rusty rubbish old boots

For a time Bealbys eyes rested on the objects with an entire lack of
interest

Then he was reminded of his not so very remote childhood when he had
found an old boot and made it into a castle

Presently he got up and walked across to the rubbish heap and surveyed
its treasures with a quickened intelligence He picked up a widowed boot
and weighed it in his hand

He dropped it abruptly turned about and hurried back into the village
street

He had ideas two ideas one for the luggage and one for the boots
If only he could manage it Hope beat his great pinions in the heart of
Bealby

Sunday The shops were shut Yes that was a fresh obstacle Hed
forgotten that

The publichouse stood bashfully open the shy uninviting openness of
Sunday morning before closing time but publichouses alas at all
hours are forbidden to little boys And besides he wasnt likely to get
what he wanted in a publichouse he wanted a shop a general shop And
here before him was the general shopand its door ajar His desire
carried him over the threshold The Sabbatical shutters made the place
dark and cool and the smell of bacon and cheese and chandleries the
very spirit of grocery calm and unhurried was cool and Sabbatical
too as if it sat there for the day in its best clothes And a pleasant
woman was talking over the counter to a thin and worried one who carried
a bundle

Their intercourse had a flavour of emergency and they both stopped
abruptly at the appearance of Bealby

His desire his craving was now so great that it had altogether subdued
the natural wiriness of his appearance He looked meek he looked good
he was swimming in propitiation and tender with respect He produced an
effect of being much smaller He had got nice eyes His movements were
refined and his manners perfect

Not doing business today my boy said the pleasant woman

Oh please m he said from his heart

Sunday you know

Oh please m If you could just give me a nold sheet of paper m
please

What for asked the pleasant woman

Just to wrap something up m

She reflected and natural goodness had its way with her

A nice big bit said the woman

Please m

Would you like it brown

Oh please m

And you got some string

Only cottony stuff said Bealby disembowelling a trouser pocket Wiv
knots But I dessay I can manage

Youd better have a bit of good string with it my dear said the
pleasant woman whose generosity was now fairly on the run Then you
can do your parcel up nice and tidy


                                   

The white horse was already in the shafts of the caravan and William a
deaf and clumsy man of uncertain age and a vast sharp nosiness was
lifting in the basket of breakfast gear and grumbling in undertones at
the wickedness and unfairness of travelling on Sunday when Bealby
returned to gladden three waiting women

Ah said the inconspicuous lady I knew hed come

Look at his poor little precious parsivel said the actress

Regarded as luggage it was rather pitiful a knobby brown paper parcel
about the sizeto be perfectly frankof a tin can two old boots and
some grass very carefully folded and tied upand carried gingerly

But the lady in the deerstalker began and then paused

Dick she said as he came nearer wheres your boots

Oh please Mum said the dauntless one they was away being mended
My stepfather thought perhaps you wouldnt mind if I didnt have boots
He said perhaps I might be able to get some more boots out of my
salary

The lady in the deerstalker looked alarmingly uncertain and Bealby
controlled infinite distresses

Havent you got a mother Dick asked the beautiful voice suddenly
Its owner abounded in such spasmodic curiosities

Shelast year Matricide is a painful business at any time And
just as you see in spite of every effort you have made the jolliest
lark in the world slipping out of your reach And the sweet voice so
sorry for him So sorry Bealby suddenly veiled his face with his elbow
and gave way to honourable tears

A simultaneous desire to make him happy help him to forget his loss
possessed three women

Thatll be all right Dick said the lady in the deerstalker patting
his shoulder Well get you some boots tomorrow And today you must
sit up beside William and spare your feet Youll have to go to the inns
with him

Its wonderful the elasticity of youth said the inconspicuous lady
five minutes later To see that boy now youd never imagine hed had a
sorrow in the world

Now get up there said the lady who was the leader We shall walk
across the fields and join you later You understand where you are to
wait for us William

She came nearer and shouted You understand William

William nodded ambiguously Ent a Vool he said

The ladies departed Youll be all right Dick cried the actress
kindly

He sat up where he had been put trying to look as Orphan Dick as
possible after all that had occurred


                                   

Do you know the wind on the heathhave you lived the Gypsy life Have
you spoken wanderers yourselves with Romany chi and Romany chal on
the windswept moors at home or abroad Have you tramped the broad
highways and at close of day pitched your tent near a running stream
and cooked your supper by starlight over a fire of pinewood Do you know
the dreamless sleep of the wanderer at peace with himself and all the
world

For most of us the answer to these questions of the Amateur Camping Club
is in the negative

Yet every year the call of the road the Borrovian glamour draws away a
certain small number of the imaginative from the grosser comforts of a
complex civilization takes them out into tents and caravans and
intimate communion with nature and incidentally with various
ingenious appliances designed to meet the needs of cooking in a breeze
It is an adventure to which high spirits and great expectations must be
brought it is an experience in proximity which few friendships
surviveand altogether very great fun

The life of breezy freedom resolves itself in practice chiefly into
washing up and an anxious search for permission to camp One learns how
rich and fruitful our world can be in bystanders and how easy it is to
forget essential groceries

The heart of the joy of it lies in its perfect detachment There you are
in the morning sunlight under the trees that overhang the road going
whither you will Everything you need you have Your van creaks along at
your side You are outside inns outside houses a home a community an
imperium in imperio At any moment you may draw out of the traffic
upon the wayside grass and say Hereuntil the owner catches us at
itis home At any timesubject to the complaisance of William and your
being able to find himyou may inspan and go onward The world is all
before you You taste the complete yet leisurely insouciance of the
snail

And two of those three ladies had other satisfactions to supplement
their pleasures They both adored Madeleine Philips She was not only
perfectly sweet and lovely but she was known to be so she had that
most potent charm for women prestige They had got her all to
themselves They could show now how false is the old idea that there is
no friendship nor conversation among women They were full of wit and
pretty things for one another and snatches of song in between And they
were free too from their menfolk They were doing without them Dr
Bowles the husband of the lady in the deerstalker was away in Ireland
and Mr Geedge the lord of the inconspicuous woman was golfing at
Sandwich And Madeleine Philips it was understood was only too glad to
shake herself free from the crowd of admirers that hovered about her
like wasps about honey

Yet after three days each one had thoughts about the need of helpfulness
and more particularly about washingup that were better left unspoken
that were indeed conspicuously unspoken beneath their merry give and
take like a black and silent river flowing beneath a bridge of ivory
And each of them had a curious feeling in the midst of all this fresh
free behaviour as though the others were not listening sufficiently as
though something of the effect of them was being wasted Madeleines
smiles became rarer at times she was almost impassive and Judy
preserved nearly all her wit and verbal fireworks for the times when
they passed through villages Mrs Geedge was less visibly affected
She had thoughts of writing a book about it all telling in the gayest
most provocative way full of the quietest quaintest humour just how
jolly they had been Menfolk would read it This kept a little thin
smile upon her lips

As an audience William was tough stuff He pretended deafness he never
looked He did not want to look He seemed always to be holding his nose
in front of his face to prevent his observationas men pray into their
hats at church But once Judy Bowles overheard a phrase or so in his
private soliloquy Pack o wimmin William was saying Dratted
petticoats Dang em Thats what I say to um Dang em

As a matter of fact he just fell short of saying it to them But his
manner said it

You begin to see how acceptable an addition was young Bealby to this
company He was not only helpful immensely helpful in things material
a vigorous and at first a careful washerup an energetic bootpolisher
a most serviceable cleaner and tidier of things but he was also belief
and support Undisguisedly he thought the caravan the loveliest thing
going and its three mistresses the most wonderful of people His alert
eyes followed them about full of an unstinted admiration and interest
he pricked his ears when Judy opened her mouth he handed things to Mrs
Geedge He made no secret about Madeleine When she spoke to him he
lost his breath he reddened and was embarrassed

They went across the fields saying that he was the luckiest of finds It
was fortunate his people had been so ready to spare him Judy said boys
were a race very cruelly maligned see how willing he was Mrs Geedge
said there was something elfin about Bealbys little face Madeleine
smiled at the thought of his quaint artlessness She knew quite clearly
that hed die for her


                                   

There was a little pause as the ladies moved away

Then William spat and spoke in a note of irrational bitterness

Brasted Voolery said William and then loudly and fiercely Cam up
yode Runt you

At these words the white horse started into a convulsive irregular
redistribution of its feet the caravan strained and quivered into
motion and Bealbys wanderings as a caravanner began

For a time William spoke no more and Bealby scarcely regarded him The
light of strange fortunes and deep enthusiasm was in Bealbys eyes

One Thing said William they dont ave the Sense to lock anythink
upwhatever

Bealbys attention was recalled to the existence of his companion

Williams face was one of those faces that give one at first the
impression of a solitary and very conceited nose The other features are
entirely subordinated to that salient effect One sees them later His
eyes were small and uneven his mouth apparently toothless thinlipped
and crumpled with the upper lip falling over the other in a manner
suggestive of a meagre firmness mixed with appetite When he spoke he
made a faint slobbering sound Everyfink he said behind there

He became confidential I been in there I larked about wiv their
Fings

They got some choclate he said lusciously Oo Fine

All sorts of Fings

He did not seem to expect any reply from Bealby

We going far before we meet em asked Bealby

Williams deafness became apparent

His mind was preoccupied by other ideas One wicked eye came close to
Bealbys face We going to ave a bit of choclate he said in a wet
desirous voice

He pointed his thumb over his shoulder at the door You get it said
William with reassuring nods and the mouth much pursed and very oblique

Bealby shook his head

Its in a little dror under er place where she sleeps

Bealbys headshake became more emphatic

Yus I tell you said William

No said Bealby

Choclate I tell you said William and ran the tongue of appetite
round the rim of his toothless mouth

Dont want choclate said Bealby thinking of a large lump of it

Go on said William Nobody wont see you

Go it said William

Youre afraid said William

Here Ill go said William losing selfcontrol You just old
these reins

Bealby took the reins William got up and opened the door of the
caravan Then Bealby realized his moral responsibilityand leaving the
reins clutched William firmly by his baggy nether garments They were
elderly garments much sat upon Dont be a Vool said William
struggling Leago my slack

Something partially gave way and Williams head came round to deal with
Bealby

What you mean pullin my cloes orf me

Thathe investigated Take me a Nour to sew up

I aint going to steal shouted Bealby into the ear of William

Nobody arst you to steal

Nor you neither said Bealby

The caravan bumped heavily against a low garden wall skidded a little
and came to rest William sat down suddenly The white horse after a
period of confusion with its legs tried the flavour of some overhanging
lilac branches and was content

Gimme those reins said William You be the Brastedest Young
Vool

Sittin ere said William presently chewin our teeth when we
might be eatin choclate

I ent got no use for you said William blowed if I ave

Then the thought of his injuries returned to him

Id make you sew em up yourself darned if I wountony youd go
running the brasted needle into me Nours work there isby the feel
of it Morn nour Goddobe done too All I got

Ill give you Sumpfin you little Beace fore I done wi you

starving

Ill steal ye fore I done with ye said William Tearin my cloes
for me Oh Cam up yold Runt We dont want you to stop and
lissen Cam up I tell you


                                   

They found the ladies rather it seemed by accident than design
waiting upon a sandy common rich with purple heather and bordered by
woods of fir and spruce They had been waiting some time and it was
clear that the sight of the yellow caravan relieved an accumulated
anxiety Bealby rejoiced to see them His soul glowed with the pride of
chocolate resisted and William overcome He resolved to distinguish
himself over the preparation of the midday meal It was a pleasant
little island of green they chose for their midday pitch a little patch
of emerald turf amidst the purple a patch already doomed to removal as
a bare oblong and a pile of rolledup turfs witnessed This pile and a
little bank of heather and bramble promised shelter from the breeze and
down the hill a hundred yards away was a spring and a builtup pool
This spot lay perhaps fifty yards away from the high road and one
reached it along a rutty track which had been made by the turf cutters
And overhead was the glorious sky of an English summer with great
clouds like sunlit whitesailed ships the Constable sky The white
horse was hobbled and turned out to pasture among the heather and
William was sent off to get congenial provender at the nearest public
house William shouted Mrs Bowles as he departed shouting
confidentially into his ear Get your clothes mended

Eh said William

Mend your clothes

Yah E did that said William viciously with a movement of
selfprotection and so went

Nobody watched him go Almost sternly they set to work upon the luncheon
preparation as William receded William Mrs Bowles remarked as she
bustled with the patent cooker putting it up wrong way round so that
afterwards it collapsed Williamtakes offence Sometimes I think he
takes offence almost too often Did you have any difficulty with him
Dick

It wasnt anything miss said Bealby meekly

Bealby was wonderful with the firelighting and except that he cracked a
plate in warming it quite admirable as a cook He burnt his fingers
twiceand liked doing it he ate his portion with instinctive modesty on
the other side of the caravan and he washed upas Mr Mergleson had
always instructed him to do Mrs Bowles showed him how to clean knives
and forks by sticking them into the turf A little to his surprise these
ladies lit and smoked cigarettes They sat about and talked
perplexingly Clever stuff Then he had to get water from the
neighbouring brook and boil the kettle for an early tea Madeleine
produced a charmingly bound little book and read in it the other two
professed themselves anxious for the view from a neighbouring hill They
produced their sensible spiked walking sticks such as one does not see
in England they seemed full of energy You go Madeleine had said
while I and Dick stay here and make tea Ive walked enough today

So Bealby happy to the pitch of ecstacy first explored the wonderful
interior of the caravanthere was a dresser a stove letdown chairs
and tables and all manner of thingsand then nursed the kettle to the
singing stage on the patent cooker while the beautiful lady reclined
close at hand on a rug

Dick she said

He had forgotten he was Dick

Dick

He remembered his personality with a start Yes miss He knelt up
with a handful of twigs in his hand and regarded her

Well Dick she said

He remained in flushed adoration There was a little pause and the lady
smiled at him an unaffected smile

What are you going to be Dick when you grow up

I dont know miss Ive wondered

What would you like to be

Something abroad Somethingso that you could see things

A soldier

Or a sailor miss

A sailor sees nothing but the sea

Id rather be a sailor than a common soldier miss

Youd like to be an officer

Yes missonly

One of my very best friends is an officer she said a little
irrelevantly it seemed to Bealby

Id be a Norficer like a shot said Bealby if I ad arf a chance
miss

Officers nowadays she said have to be very brave able men

I know miss said Bealby modestly

The fire required attention for a little while

The lady turned over on her elbow What do you think you are likely
to be Dick she asked

He didnt know

What sort of man is your stepfather

Bealby looked at her He isnt much he said

What is he

Bealby hadnt the slightest intention of being the son of a gardener
Es a lawwriter

What in that village

E as to stay there for is ealth miss he said Every summer Is
ealth is very preprecocious miss

He fed his fire with a few judiciously administered twigs

What was your own father Dick

With that she opened a secret door in Bealbys imagination All
stepchildren have those dreams With him they were so frequent and vivid
that they had long since become a kind of second truth He coloured a
little and answered with scarcely an interval for reflection E passed
as Maltravers he said

Wasnt that his name

I dont rightly know miss There was always something kep from me My
mother used to say Artie she used to say theres things that some
day you must know things that concern you Things about your farver
But poor as we are now and struggling Not yet Some day you shall
know trulywho you are That was ow she said it miss

And she died before she told you

He had almost forgotten that he had killed his mother that very morning
Yes miss he said

She smiled at him and something in her smile made him blush hotly For a
moment he could have believed she understood And indeed she did
understand and it amused her to find this boy doingwhat she herself
had done at timeswhat indeed she felt it was still in her to do She
felt that most delicate of sympathies the sympathy of one rather
overimaginative person for another But her next question dispelled his
doubt of her though it left him red and hot She asked it with a
convincing simplicity

Have you any idea Dick have you any guess or suspicion I mean who
it is you really are

I wish I had miss he said I suppose it doesnt matter reallybut
one cant help wondering

How often he had wondered in his lonely wanderings through that dear
city of daydreams where all the people one knows look out of windows as
one passes and the roads are paved with pride How often had he decided
and changed and decided again


                                   

Now suddenly a realization of intrusion shattered this conversation A
third person stood over the little encampment smiling mysteriously and
waving a cleek in a slow hieratic manner through the air

De licious lill corn said the newcomer in tones of benediction

He met their enquiring eyes with a luxurious smile Licious he said
and remained swaying insecurely and failing to express some imperfectly
apprehended deep meaning by short peculiar movements of the cleek

He was obviously a golfer astray from some adjacent courseand he had
lunched

Mighty Join you he said and then very distinctly in a full large
voice Miss Malleleine Philps There are the penalties of a public and
popular life

Hes drunk the lady whispered Get him to go away Dick I cant
endure drunken men

She stood up and Bealby stood up He advanced in front of her slowly
with his nose in the air extraordinarily like a small terrier smelling
at a strange dog

I said Mighty Join you the golfer repeated His voice was richly
excessive He was a big heavy man with a shortcropped moustache a
great deal of neck and dewlap and a solemn expression

Prup Ber Introzuze mself he remarked He tried to indicate
himself by waving his hand towards himself but finally abandoned the
attempt as impossible Ma Goo Sochl Poshishun he said

Bealby had a disconcerting sense of retreating footsteps behind him He
glanced over his shoulder and saw Miss Philips standing at the foot of
the steps that led up to the fastnesses of the caravan Dick she
cried with a sharp note of alarm in her voice get rid of that man

A moment after Bealby heard the door shut and a sound of a key in its
lock He concealed his true feelings by putting his arms akimbo
sticking his legs wider apart and contemplating the task before him with
his head a little on one side He was upheld by the thought that the
yellow caravan had a window looking upon him

The newcomer seemed to consider the ceremony of introduction completed
I done care for goff he said almost vaingloriously

He waved his cleek to express his preference Natua he said with a
satisfaction that bordered on fatuity

He prepared to come down from the little turfy crest on which he stood
to the encampment

Ere said Bealby This is Private

The golfer indicated by solemn movements of the cleek that this was
understood but that other considerations overrode it

YouYou got to go cried Bealby in a breathless squeak You get out
of here

The golfer waved an arm as who should say You do not understand but I
forgive you and continued to advance towards the fire And then
Bealby at the end of his tact commenced hostilities

He did so because he felt he had to do something and he did not know
what else to do

Wan nothin but frenly conversation sushus custmry webred peel the
golfer was saying and then a large fragment of turf hit him in the
neck burst all about him and stopped him abruptly

He remained for some lengthy moments too astonished for words He was
not only greatly surprised but he chose to appear even more surprised
than he was In spite of the brownblack mould upon his cheek and brow
and a slight displacement of his cap he achieved a sort of dignity He
came slowly to a focus upon Bealby who stood by the turf pile grasping
a second missile The cleek was extended sceptrewise

Replace theDivot

You go orf said Bealby Ill chuck it if you dont I tell you
fair

Replace theDIVOT roared the golfer again in a voice of extraordinary
power

Youyou go said Bealby

Am I task you Third time ReshpectRoos Replace the Divot

It struck him fully in the face

He seemed to emerge through the mould He was blinking but still
dignified Thawas intentional he said

He seemed to gather himself together

Then suddenly and with a surprising nimbleness he discharged himself at
Bealby He came with astonishing swiftness He got within a foot of him
Well it was for Bealby that he had learnt to dodge in the village
playground He went down under the golfers arm and away round the end
of the stack and the golfer with his force spent in concussion remained
for a time clinging to the turf pile and apparently trying to remember
how he got there Then he was reminded of recent occurrences by a shrill
small voice from the other side of the stack

You gow away said the voice Cant you see youre annoying a lady
You gow away

Nowishnoy anyone Pease wall wirl

But this was subterfuge He meant to catch that boy Suddenly and rather
brilliantly he turned the flank of the turf pile and only a couple of
loose turfs at the foot of the heap upset his calculations He found
himself on all fours on ground from which it was difficult to rise But
he did not lose heart Boyhicscow he said and became for a second
rush a nimble quadruped

Again he got quite astonishingly near to Bealby and then in an instant
was on his feet and running across the encampment after him He
succeeded in kicking over the kettle and the patent cooker without any
injury to himself or loss of pace and succumbed only to the sharp turn
behind the end of the caravan and the steps He hadnt somehow thought
of the steps So he went down rather heavily But now the spirit of a
fine man was roused Regardless of the scream from inside that had
followed his collapse he was up and in pursuit almost instantly Bealby
only escaped the swiftness of his rush by jumping the shafts and going
away across the front of the caravan to the turf pile again The golfer
tried to jump the shafts too but he was not equal to that He did in a
manner jump But it was almost as much diving as jumping And there was
something in it almost like the curvetting of a Great Horse

When Bealby turned at the crash the golfer was already on all fours
again and trying very busily to crawl out between the shaft and the
front wheel He would have been more successful in doing this if he had
not begun by putting his arm through the wheel As it was he was trying
to do too much he was trying to crawl out at two points at once and
getting very rapidly annoyed at his inability to do so The caravan was
shifting slowly forward

It was manifest to Bealby that getting this man to go was likely to be a
much more lengthy business than he had supposed

He surveyed the situation for a moment and then realizing the
entanglement of his opponent he seized a campstool by one leg went
round by the steps and attacked the prostrate enemy from the rear with
effectual but inconclusive fury He hammered

Steady on young man said a voice and he was seized from behind He
turnedto discover himself in the grip of a second golfer

Another Bealby fought in a fury of fear

He bit an armrather too tweedy to feel muchand got in a couple of
shinnersalas that they were only slippered shinnersbefore he was
overpowered

A cuffed crumpled disarmed and panting Bealby found himself watching
the careful extraction of the first golfer from the front wheel Two
friends assisted that gentleman with a reproachful gentleness and his
repeated statements that he was all right seemed to reassure them
greatly Altogether there were now four golfers in the field counting
the pioneer

He was after this devil of a boy said the one who held Bealby

Yes but how did he get here asked the man who was gripping Bealby

Feel better now said the third helping the first comer to his
uncertain feet Let me have your cleek o man You wont want your
cleek

Across the heather lifting their heads a little came Mrs Bowles and
Mrs Geedge returning from their walk They were wondering whoever
their visitors could be

And then like music after a dispute came Madeleine Philips a beautiful
bluerobed thing coming slowly with a kind of wonder on her face out
of the caravan and down the steps Instinctively everybody turned to
her The drunkard with a gesture released himself from his supporter and
stood erect His cap was replaced upon himobliquely His cleek had been
secured

I heard a noise said Madeleine lifting her pretty chin and speaking
in her sweetest tones She looked her enquiries

She surveyed the three sober men with a practised eye She chose the
tallest a fair seriouslooking young man standing conveniently at the
drunkards elbow

Will you please take your friend away she said indicating the
offender with her beautiful white hand

Simly he said in a slightly subdued voice simly coring

Everybody tried for a moment to understand him

Look here old man youve got no business here said the fair young
man Youd better come back to the club house

The drunken man stuck to his statement Simly coring he said a little
louder

I think said a little brighteyed man with a very cheerful yellow
vest I think hes apologizing I hope so

The drunken man nodded his head That among other matters

The tall young man took his arm but he insisted on his point Simly
coring he said with emphasis Ififdone wan me to cor Notome
Nottot Mean say Nottot tattome Nottotome Orny waysayin
notome No wish trude No wish all

Well then you see youd better come away

I ars youare you tome MissMiss Pips He appealed to Miss
Philips

If youd answer him said the tall young man

No sir she said with great dignity and the pretty chin higher than
ever I am not at home

Nuthin more t say then said the drunken man and with a sudden
stoicism he turned away

Come he said submitting to support

Simly orny arfnoon cor he said generally and permitted himself to be
led off

Orny frenly cor

For some time he was audible as he receded explaining in a rather
condescending voice the extreme social correctness of his behaviour
Just for a moment or so there was a slight tussle due to his desire to
return and leave cards

He was afterwards seen to be distributing a small handful of visiting
cards amidst the heather with his free arm rather in the manner of a
paper chasebut much more gracefully

Then decently and in order he was taken out of sight


                                   

Bealby had been unostentatiously released by his captor as soon as Miss
Philips appeared and the two remaining golfers now addressed themselves
to the three ladies in regret and explanation

The man who had held Bealby was an aquiline greyclad person with a
cascade moustache and wrinkled eyes and for some obscure reason he
seemed to be amused the little man in the yellow vest however was
quite earnest and serious enough to make up for him He was one of those
little freshcoloured men whose faces stick forward openly He had open
projecting eyes an open mouth his cheeks were frank to the pitch of
ostentation his cap was thrust back from his exceptionally open
forehead He had a chest and a stomach There too he held out He
would have held out anything His legs leant forward from the feet It
was evidently impossible for a man of his nature to be anything but
clean shaved

Our fault entirely he said Ought to have looked after him Cant
say how sorry and ashamed we are Cant say how sorry we are he caused
you any inconvenience

Of course said Mrs Bowles our boyservant ought not to have pelted
him

He didnt exactly pelt him dear said Madeleine

Well anyhow our friend ought not to have been off his chain It was
our affair to look after him and we didnt

You see the open young man went on with the air of lucid
explanation hes our worst player And he got round in a hundred and
twentyseven And beatsomebody Andits upset him Its not a bit of
good disguising that weve been letting him drink We have To begin
with we encouraged him We oughtnt to have let him go But we
thought a walk alone might do him good And some of us were a bit off
him Fed up rather You see hed been singing would go on singing

He went on to propitiations Anything the club can do to show how we
regret If you would like to pitchlater on in our rough beyond the
pinewoods Youd find it safe and secluded Custodianmost civil
man Get you water or anything you wanted Especially after all that has
happened

Bealby took no further part in these concluding politenesses He had a
curious feeling in his mind that perhaps he had not managed this affair
quite so well as he might have done He ought to have been more tactful
like more persuasive He was a fool to have started chucking Well
well He picked up the overturned kettle and went off down the hill to
get water

What had she thought of him

In the meantime one can at least boil kettles


                                   

One consequence of this little incident of the rejoicing golfer was that
the three ladies were no longer content to dismiss William and Bealby at
nightfall and sleep unprotected in the caravan And this time their
pitch was a lonely one with only the golf club house within call They
were inclined even to distrust the golf club So it was decided to his
great satisfaction that Bealby should have a certain sleeping sack Mrs
Bowles had brought with her and that he should sleep therein between the
wheels

This sleeping sack was to have been a great feature of the expedition
but when it came to the test Judy could not use it She had not
anticipated that feeling of extreme publicity the open air gives one at
first It was like having all the world in ones bedroom Every night
she had relapsed into the caravan

Bealby did not mind what they did with him so long as it meant sleeping
He had had a long day of it He undressed sketchily and wriggled into
the nice woolly bag and lay for a moment listening to the soft bumpings
that were going on overhead She was there He had the instinctive
confidence of our sex in women and here were three of them He had a
vague idea of getting out of his bag again and kissing the underside of
the van that held this dear beautiful creature

He didnt

Such a lot of things had happened that dayand the day before He had
been going without intermission it seemed now for endless hours He
thought of trees roads dewwet grass fryingpans pursuing packs of
gigantic butlers hopelessly at faultno doubt they were hunting
nowchinks and crannies tactless missiles flying bursting missiles it
was vain to recall He stared for a few seconds through the wheel spokes
at the dancing crackling fire of pinecones which it had been his last
duty to replenish stared and blinked much as a little dog might do and
then he had slipped away altogether into the world of dreams


                                   

In the morning he was extraordinarily hard to wake

Is it after sleeping all day yed be cried Judy Bowles who was
always at her most Irish about breakfast time




                               CHAPTER IV
                        THE UNOBTRUSIVE PARTING


                                   

Monday was a happy day for Bealby

The caravan did seventeen miles and came to rest at last in a sloping
field outside a cheerful little village set about a green on which was a
long tent professing to be a theatre At the first stoppingplace
that possessed a general shop Mrs Bowles bought Bealby a pair of boots
Then she had a bright idea Got any pocket money Dick she asked

She gave him half a crown that is to say she gave him two shillings and
sixpence or five sixpences or thirty penniesaccording as you choose to
look at itin one large undivided shining coin

Even if he had not been in love here surely was incentive to a generous
nature to help and do distinguished services He dashed about doing
things The little accident on Sunday had warned him to be careful of
the plates and the only flaw upon a perfect days service was the
dropping of an egg on its way to the frying pan for supper It remained
where it fell and there presently he gave it a quiet burial There was
nothing else to be done with it

All day long at intervals Miss Philips smiled at him and made him do
little services for her And in the evening after the custom of her
great profession when it keeps holiday she insisted on going to the
play She said it would be the loveliest fun She went with Mrs Bowles
because Mrs Geedge wanted to sit quietly in the caravan and write down
a few little things while they were still fresh in her mind And it
wasnt in the part of Madeleine Philips not to insist that both William
and Bealby must go too she gave them each a shillingthough the prices
were sixpence threepence twopence and a pennyand Bealby saw his
first real play

It was called Brothers in Blood or the Gentleman Ranker There was a
posterwhich was only very slightly justified by the performanceof a
man in khaki with a bandaged head proposing to sell his life dearly over
a fallen comrade

One went to the play through an open and damaged field gate and across
trampled turf Outside the tent were two paraffin flares illuminating
the poster and a small cluster of the impecunious young Within on grass
that was worn and bleached were benches a gathering audience a piano
played by an offhand lady and a drop scene displaying the Grand Canal
Venice The Grand Canal was infested by a crowded multitude of zealous
and excessive reflections of the palaces above and by peculiar
crescentic black boats floating entirely out of water and having no
reflections at all The offhand lady gave a broad impression of the
wedding march in Lohengrin and the back seats assisted by a sort of
gastric vocalization called humming and by whistling between the teeth
Madeleine Philips evidently found it tremendous fun even before the
curtain rose

And thenillusion

The scenery was ridiculous it waved about the actors and actresses
were surely the most pitiful of their tribe and every invention in the
play impossible but the imagination of Bealby like the loving kindness
of God made no difficulties it rose and met and embraced and gave life
to all these things It was a confused story in the play everybody was
more or less somebody else all the way through and it got more confused
in Bealbys mind but it was clear from the outset that there was vile
work afoot nets spread and sweet simple people wronged And never were
sweet and simple people quite so sweet and simple There was the
wrongful brother who was weak and wicked and the rightful brother who
was vindictively almost viciously good and there was an ingrained
villain who was a baronet a man who wore a frock coat and a silk hat
and carried gloves and a stick in every scene and upon all
occasionsthat sort of man He looked askance always There was a dear
simple girl with a vast sweet smile who was loved according to their
natures by the wrongful and the rightful brother and a large wicked
redclad lipbiting woman whose passions made the crazy little stage
quiver There was a comic butlervery different stuff from old
Merglesonwho wore an evening coat and plaid trousers and nearly choked
Bealby Why werent all butlers like that Funny And there were
constant denunciations Always there were denunciations going on or
denunciations impending That took Bealby particularly Never surely in
all the world were bad people so steadily and thoroughly scolded and
told what Everybody hissed them Bealby hissed them And when they were
told what he applauded And yet they kept on with their wickedness to
the very curtain They retiredaskance to the end Foiled but pursuing
A time will come they said

There was a moment in the distresses of the heroine when Bealby dashed
aside a tear And then at last most wonderfully it all came right The
company lined up and hoped that Bealby was satisfied Bealby wished he
had more hands His heart seemed to fill his body Oh prime prime

And out he came into the sympathetic night But he was no longer a
trivial Bealby his soul was purged he was a strong and silent man
ready to explode into generous repartee or nerve himself for high
endeavour He slipped off in the opposite direction from the caravan
because he wanted to be alone for a time and feel He did not want to
jar upon a sphere of glorious illusion that had blown up in his mind
like a bubble

He was quite sure that he had been wronged Not to be wronged is to
forego the first privilege of goodness He had been deeply wronged by a
plotall those butlers were in the plot or why should they have chased
himhe was much older than he really was it had been kept from him
and in truth he was a rightful earl Earl Shonts he whispered and
indeed why not And Madeleine too had been wronged she had been
reduced to wander in this uncomfortable caravan this Gipsy Queen she
had been brought to it by villains the same villains who had wronged
Bealby

Out he went into the night the kindly consenting summer night where
there is nothing to be seen or heard that will contradict these
delicious wonderful persuasions

He was so full of these dreams that he strayed far away along the dark
country lanes and had at last the utmost difficulty in finding his way
back to the caravan And when ultimately he got back after hours and
hours of heroic existence it did not even seem that they had missed him
It did not seem that he had been away half an hour


                                   

Tuesday was not so happy a day for Bealby as Monday

Its shadows began when Mrs Bowles asked him in a friendly tone when it
was cleancollar day

He was unready with his answer

And dont you ever use a hair brush Dick she asked Im sure now
theres one in your parcel

I do use it sometimes Mum he admitted

And Ive never detected you with a toothbrush yet Though that perhaps
is extreme And Dicksoap I think youd better be letting me give you a
cake of soap

Id be very much obliged Mum

I hardly dare hint Dick at a clean handkerchief Such things are
known

If you wouldnt mindwhen Ive got the breakfast things done Mum

The thing worried him all through breakfast He had not
expectedpersonalities from Mrs Bowles More particularly personalities
of this kind He felt he had to think hard

He affected modesty after he had cleared away breakfast and carried off
his little bundle to a point in the stream which was masked from the
encampment by willows With him he also brought that cake of soap He
began by washing his handkerchief which was bad policy because that
left him no dry towel but his jacket He ought he perceived to have
secured a dishcloth or a newspaper This he must remember on the next
occasion He did over his hands and the more exposed parts of his face
with soap and jacket Then he took off and examined his collar It
certainly was pretty bad

Why cried Mrs Bowles when he returned thats still the same
collar

They all seem tove got crumpled m said Bealby

But are they all as dirty

I ad some blacking in my parcel said Bealby and it got loose Mum
Ill have to get another collar when we come to a shop

It was a financial sacrifice but it was the only way and when they
came to the shop Bealby secured a very nice collar indeed high with
pointed turndown corners so that it cut his neck all round jabbed him
under the chin and gave him a proud upcast carriage of the head that led
to his treading upon and very completely destroying a stray plate while
preparing lunch But it was more of a mans collar he felt than
anything he had ever worn before And it cost sixpence halfpenny six
dee and a half

I should have mentioned that while washing up the breakfast things he
had already broken the handle off one of the breakfast cups Both these
accidents deepened the cloud upon his day

And then there was the trouble of William William having meditated upon
the differences between them for a day had now invented an activity As
Bealby sat beside him behind the white horse he was suddenly and
frightfully pinched Gee One wanted to yelp

Choclate said William through his teeth and very very savagely
Now then

After William had done that twice Bealby preferred to walk beside the
caravan Thereupon William whipped up the white horse and broke records
and made all the crockery sing together and forced the pace until he was
spoken to by Mrs Bowles

It was upon a Bealby thus depressed and worried that the rumour of
impending menfolk came It began after the party had stopped for
letters at a village post office there were not only letters but a
telegram that Mrs Bowles read with her spats far apart and her head on
one side Yed like to know about it she said waggishly to Miss
Philips and you just shant

She then went into her letters

Youve got some news said Mrs Geedge

I have that said Mrs Bowles and not a word more could they get from
her

Ill keep my news no longer said Mrs Bowles lighting her cigarette
after lunch as Bealby hovered about clearing away the banana skins and
suchlike vestiges of dessert Tomorrow night as ever is if so be we
get to WinthorpeSutbury therell be Men among us

But Toms not coming said Mrs Geedge

He asked Tim to tell me to tell you

And youve kept it these two hours Judy

For your own good and peace of mind But now the murthers out Come
they will your Man and my Man pretending to a pity because they cant
do without us But like the selfindulgent monsters they are they must
needs stop at some grand hotel Redlake he calls it the Royal on the
hill above WinthorpeSutbury The Royal The very name describes it
Cant you see the lounge girls with its white cane chairs And
saddlebacks No other hotel it seems is good enough for them and we if
you please are asked to go in and havewhat does the man call itthe
comforts of decencyand let the caravan rest for a bit

Tim promised me I should run wild as long as I chose said Mrs
Geedge looking anything but wild

Theyre after thinking weve had enough of it said Mrs Bowles

It sounds like that

Sure Id go on like this for ever said Judy Tis the Man and the
House and all of it that oppresses me Vans for Women

Lets not go to WinthorpeSutbury said Madeleine

The first word of sense Bealby had heard

Ah said Mrs Bowles archly who knows but what therell be a Man for
you Some sort of Man anyhow

Bealby thought that a most improper remark

I want no man

Ah

Why do you say Ah like that

Because I mean Ah like that

Meaning

Just that

Miss Philips eyed Mrs Bowles and Mrs Bowles eyed Miss Philips

Judy she said youve got something up your sleeve

Where its perfectly comfortable said Mrs Bowles

And then quite maddeningly she remarked Will you be after washing up
presently Dick and looked at him with a roguish quiet over her
cigarette It was necessary to disabuse her mind at once of the idea
that he had been listening He took up the last few plates and went off
to the washing place by the stream All the rest of that conversation
had to be lost

Except that as he came back for the Hudsons soap he heard Miss Philips
say Keep your old Men Ill just console myself with Dick my dears
Making such a Mystery

To which Mrs Bowles replied darkly She little knows

A kind of consolation was to be got from that But what was it she
little knew


                                   

The menfolk when they came were nothing so terrific to the sight as
Bealby had expected And thank Heaven there were only two of them and
each assigned Something he perceived was said about someone else he
couldnt quite catch what but if there was to have been someone else
at any rate there now wasnt Professor Bowles was animated and Mr
Geedge was gracefully cold they kissed their wives but not offensively
and there was a chattering pause while Bealby walked on beside the
caravan They were on the bare road that runs along the high ridge above
WinthorpeSutbury and the men had walked to meet them from some hotel
or otherBealby wasnt clear about thatby the golf links Judy was the
life and soul of the encounter and all for asking the men what they
meant by intruding upon three independent women who surealive could
very well do without them Professor Bowles took her pretty calmly and
seemed on the whole to admire her

Professor Bowles was a compact little man wearing spectacles with
alternative glasses partly curved partly flat he was hairy and
dressed in that sort of soft tweedy stuff that ravels outhe seemed to
have been sitting among thornsand baggy knickerbockers with straps and
very thick stockings and very sensible open air in fact quite
mountainous boots And yet though he was short and stout and active he
had a kind of authority about him and it was clear that for all her
persuasiveness his wife merely ran over him like a creeper without
making any great difference to him Ive found he said the perfect
place for your encampment She had been making suggestions And
presently he left the ladies and came hurrying after the caravan to take
control

He was evidently a very controlling person

Here you get down he said to William That poor beasts got enough
to pull without you

And when William mumbled he said Hey in such a shout that William
for ever after held his peace

Where dyou come from you boy you he asked suddenly and Bealby
looked to Mrs Bowles to explain

Great silly collar youve got said the Professor interrupting her
reply Boy like this ought to wear a wool shirt Dirty too Take it
off boy Its choking you Dont you feel it

Then he went on to make trouble about the tackle William had rigged to
contain the white horse

This harness makes me sick said Professor Bowles Its worse than
Italy

Ah he cried and suddenly darted off across the turf going
inelegantly and very rapidly with peculiar motions of the head and neck
as he brought first the flat and then the curved surface of his glasses
into play Finally he dived into the turf remained scrabbling on all
fours for a moment or so became almost still for the fraction of a
minute and then got up and returned to his wife holding in an exquisite
manner something that struggled between his finger and his thumb

Thats the third today he said triumphantly They swarm here Its
a migration

Then he resumed his penetrating criticism of the caravan outfit

That boy he said suddenly with his glasses oblique hasnt taken off
his collar yet

Bealby revealed the modest secrets of his neck and pocketed the
collar

Mr Geedge did not appear to observe Bealby He was a man of the
superaquiline type with a nose like a rudder he held his face as if it
was a hatchet in a procession and walked with the dignity of a man of
honour You could see at once he was a man of honour Inflexibly
invincibly he was a man of honour You felt that anywhen in a fire in
an earthquake in a railway accident when other people would be running
about and doing things he would have remaineda man of honour It was
his pride rather than his vanity to be mistaken for Sir Edward Grey He
now walked along with Miss Philips and his wife behind the disputing
Bowleses and discoursed in deep sonorous tones about the healthiness of
healthy places and the stifling feeling one had in towns when there was
no air


                                   

The Professor was remarkably active when at last the point he had
chosen for the encampment was reached Bealby was told to look alive
twice and William was assigned to his genus and species The mans
an absolute idiot was the way the Professor put it William just
shot a glance at him over his nose The place certainly commanded a
wonderful view It was a turfy bank protected from the north and south
by bushes of yew and the beechbordered edge of a chalk pit it was
close beside the road a road which went steeply down the hill into
WinthorpeSutbury with that intrepid decision peculiar to the
hillroads of the south of England It looked indeed as though you
could throw the rinse of your teacups into the WinthorpeSutbury
street as if you could jump and impale yourself upon the church
spire The hills bellied out east and west and carried hangers and
then swept round to the west in a long level succession of
projections a perspective that merged at last with the general
horizon of hilly bluenesses amidst which Professor Bowles insisted
upon a sapphire glimpse of sea The Channel said Professor
Bowles as though that made it easier for them Only Mr Geedge
refused to see even that mitigated version of the sea There was
something perhaps bluish and level but he was evidently not going to
admit it was sea until he had paddled in it and tested it in every way
known to him

Good Lord cried the Professor Whats the man doing now

William stopped the struggles and confidential discouragements he was
bestowing upon the white horse and waited for a more definite reproach

Putting the caravan alongside to the sun Do you think it will ever get
cool again And think of the blaze of the sunsetthrough the glass of
that door

William spluttered If I putn tother waygoo runnin down thill
like said William

Imbecile cried the Professor Put something under the wheels
Here He careered about and produced great grey fragments of a
perished yew tree Now then he said Head up hill

William did his best

Oh not like that Here you

Bealby assisted with obsequious enthusiasm

It was some time before the caravan was adjusted to the complete
satisfaction of the Professor But at last it was done and the end door
gaped at the whole prospect of the Weald with the steps hanging out
idiotically like a tongue The hind wheels were stayed up very cleverly
by lumps of chalk and chunks of yew living and dead and certainly the
effect of it was altogether taller and better And then the preparations
for the midday cooking began The Professor was full of acute ideas
about camping and cooking and gave Bealby a lively but instructive
time There was no stream handy but William was sent off to the hotel
to fetch a garden watercart that the Professor with infinite foresight
had arranged should be ready

The Geedges held aloof from these preparationsthey were unassuming
people Miss Philips concentrated her attention upon the Wealdit seemed
to Bealby a little discontentedlyas if it was unworthy of herand Mrs
Bowles hovered smoking cigarettes over her husbands activities acting
great amusement

You see it pleases me to get Himself busy she said Youll end a
Camper yet Darlint and us in the hotel

The Professor answered nothing but seemed to plunge deeper into
practicality

Under the urgency of Professor Bowles Bealby stumbled and broke a glass
jar of marmalade over some fried potatoes but otherwise did well as a
cooks assistant Once things were a little interrupted by the Professor
going off to catch a cricket but whether it was the right sort of
cricket or not he failed to get it And then with three loud reportsfor
a moment Bealby thought the mad butlers from Shonts were upon him with
firearmsCaptain Douglas arrived and got off his motor bicycle and left
it by the roadside His machine accounted for his delay for those were
the early days of motor bicycles It also accounted for a black smudge
under one of his bright little eyes He was fair and flushed dressed in
oilskins and a helmetshaped cap and great gauntlets that made him in
spite of the smudge look strange and brave and handsome like a
Crusaderonly that he was clad in oilskin and not steel and his
moustache was smaller than those Crusaders wore and when he came across
the turf to the encampment Mrs Bowles and Mrs Geedge both set up a cry
of AAh and Miss Philips turned an accusing face upon those two
ladies Bealby knelt with a bunch of knives and forks in his hand
laying the cloth for lunch and when he saw Captain Douglas approaching
Miss Philips he perceived clearly that that lady had already forgotten
her lowly adorer and his little heart was smitten with desolation This
man was arrayed like a chivalrous god and how was a poor Bealby whose
very collar his one little circlet of manhood had been reft from him
how was he to compete with this tremendousness In that hour the
ambition for mechanism the passion for leather and oilskin was sown in
Bealbys heart

I told you not to come near me for a month said Madeleine but her
face was radiant

These motor bicyclesvery difficult to control said Captain Douglas
and all the little goldenwhite hairs upon his sunlit cheek glittered in
the sun

And besides said Mrs Bowles its all nonsense

The Professor was in a state of arrested administration the three
others were frankly audience to a clearly understood scene

You ought to be in France

Im not in France

I sent you into exile for a month and she held out a hand for the
captain to kiss

He kissed it

Someday somewhere it was written in the book of destiny Bealby should
also kiss hands It was a lovely thing to do

Month Its been years said the captain Years and years

Then you ought to have come back before she replied and the captain
had no answer ready


                                   

When William arrived with the watercart he brought also further proofs
of the Professors organizing ability He brought various bottles of
wine red Burgundy and sparkling hock two bottles of cider and
peculiar and meritorious waters he brought tinned things for hors
duvre he brought some luscious pears When he had a moment with
Bealby behind the caravan he repeated thrice in tones of hopeless
sorrow Theyll eat um all I knows theyll eat um all And then
plumbing a deeper deep of woe Ef they dont theyll count um Ode
Gogglesll bag um Es a bagger e is

It was the brightest of luncheons that was eaten that day in the
sunshine and spaciousness above WinthorpeSutbury Everyone was gay and
even the lovetorn Bealby who might well have sunk into depression and
lethargy was galvanized into an activity that was almost cheerful by
flashes from the Professors glasses They talked of this and that
Bealby hadnt much time to attend though the laughter that followed
various sallies from Judy Bowles was very tantalizing and it had come
to the pears before his attention wasnt so much caught as felled by the
word Shonts It was as if the sky had suddenly changed to
vermilion All these people were talking of Shonts

Went there said Captain Douglas in perfect good faith Wanted to
fill up Lucys little party One doesnt go to Shonts nowadays for idle
pleasure And thenI get ordered out of the house absolutely Told to
Go

This man had been at Shonts

That was on Sunday morning said Mrs Geedge

On Sunday morning said Mrs Bowles suddenly we were almost within
sight of Shonts

This man had been at Shonts even at the time when Bealby was there

Early on Sunday morning Told to go I was fairly flabbergasted What
the deuce is a man to do Wheres he to go Sunday One doesnt go to
places Sunday morning There Id been sleeping like a lamb all night
and suddenly in came Laxton and said Look here you know he said
youve got to oblige me and pack your bag and go Now Why said I
Because youve driven the Lord Chancellor stark staring mad

But how asked the Professor almost angrily how I dont see it
Why should he ask you to go

I dont know cried Captain Douglas

Yes but said the Professor protesting against the unreasonableness
of mankind

Id had a word or two with him in the train Nothing to speak of About
occupying two corner seatsalways strikes me as a cads trickbut on my
honour I didnt rub it in And then he got it into his head we were
laughing at him at dinnerwe were a bit but only the sort of thing one
says about anyoneway he works his eyebrows and all thatand then he
thought I was ragging him I dont rag people Got it so strongly
he made a row that night Said Id made a ghost slap him on his back
Hang itwhat can you say to a thing like that In my room all the
time

You suffer for the sins of your brother said Mrs Bowles

Heavens cried the captain I never thought of that Perhaps he
mistook me

He reflected for a moment and continued his narrative Then in the
night you know he heard noises

They always do said the Professor nodding confirmation

Couldnt sleep

A sure sign said the Professor

And finally he sallied out in the early morning caught the butler in
one of the secret passages

How did the butler get into the secret passage

Going round I suppose Part of his duties Anyhow he gave the poor
beggar an awful doingawfulbrutalblack eyeall that sort of thing
man much too respectful to hit back Finally declared Id been getting
up a kind of ragsquaring the servants to help and so forth Laxton
I fancy half believed it Awkward thing you know having it said
about that you ragged the Lord Chancellor Makes a man seem a sort of
mischievous idiot Injures a man Then going away you see seems a kind
of admission

Why did you go

Lucy said the captain compactly Hysterics

Shonts would have burst he added if I hadnt gone

Madeleine was helpful But youll have to do something further she
said

What is one to do squealed the captain

The sooner you get the Lord Chancellor certified a lunatic said the
Professor soundly the better for your professional prospects

He went on pretty bad after Id gone

Youve heard

Two letters I picked em up at Wheatley Post Office this morning You
know he hadnt done with that butler Actually got out of his place and
scruffed the poor devil at lunch Shook him like a rat she says Said
the man wasnt giving him anything to drinknice story eh Anyhow he
scruffed him until things got broken

I had it all from Minnie Timbreyou know used to be Minnie Flax He
shot a propitiating glance at Madeleine Used to be neighbours of ours
you know in the old time Half the people she says didnt know what
was happening Thought the butler was apoplectic and that old Moggeridge
was helping him stand up Taking off his collar It was Laxton thought
of saying it was a fit Told everybody she says Had to tell em
Something I suppose But she saw better and she thinks a good many
others did Laxton ran em both out of the room Nice scene for Shonts
eh Thundering awkward for poor Lucy Not the sort of thing the county
expected Has her both ways Cant go to a house where the Lord
Chancellor goes mad One alternative Cant go to a house where the
butler has fits Thats the other See the dilemma

Ive got a letter from Lucy too Its herehe struggledSee Eight
sheetspencil No Joke for a man to read that And she writes worse than
any decent selfrespecting illiterate woman has a right to do Quivers
Like writing in a train Cant read half of it But shes got
something about a boy on her mind Mad about a boy Have I taken away a
boy Theyve lost a boy Took him in my luggage I suppose Shed better
write to the Lord Chancellor Likely as not he met him in some odd
corner and flew at him Smashed him to atoms Dispersed him Anyhow
theyve lost a boy

He protested to the world I cant go hunting lost boys for Lucy
Ive done enough coming away as I did

Mrs Bowles held out an arresting cigarette

What sort of boy was lost she asked

I dont know Some little beast of a boy I daresay shed only
imagined it Whole thing been too much for her

Read that over again said Mrs Bowles about losing a boy Weve
found one

That little chap

We found that boyshe glanced over her shoulder but Bealby was
nowhere to be seenon Sunday morning near Shonts He strayed into us
like a lost kitten

But I thought you said you knew his father Judy objected the
Professor

Didnt verify said Mrs Bowles shortly and then to Captain Douglas
read over again what Lady Laxton says about him


                                   

Captain Douglas struggled with the difficulties of his cousins
handwriting

Everybody drew together over the fragments of the dessert with an eager
curiosity and helped to weigh Lady Laxtons rather dishevelled
phrases


                                   

Well call the principal witness said Mrs Bowles at last warming to
the business Dick

Diick

Dick

The Professor got up and strolled round behind the caravan Then he
returned No boy there

He heard said Mrs Bowles in a large whisper and making round
wondereyes

She says said Douglas that the chances are hes got into the
secret passages

The Professor strolled out to the road and looked up it and then down
upon the roofs of WinthorpeSutbury No he said Hes mizzled

Hes only gone away for a bit said Mrs Geedge He does sometimes
after lunch Hell come back to wash up

Hes probably taking a snooze among the yew bushes before facing the
labours of washing up said Mrs Bowles He cant have mizzled You
see  in there  He cant by any chance have taken his luggage

She got up and clamberedwith a little difficulty because of its
piledup position into the caravan Its all right she called out of
the door His little parsivel is still here

Her head disappeared again

I dont think hed go away like this said Madeleine After all what
is there for him to go toeven if he is Lady Laxtons missing boy

I dont believe he heard a word of it said Mrs Geedge

Mrs Bowles reappeared with a curiouslooking brown paper parcel in her
hand She descended carefully She sat down by the fire and held the
parcel on her knees She regarded it and her companions waggishly and
lit a fresh cigarette Our link with Dick she said with the
cigarette in her mouth

She felt the parcel she poised the parcel she looked at it more and
more waggishly I wonder she said

Her expression became so waggish that her husband knew she was committed
to behaviour of the utmost ungentlemanliness He had long ceased to
attempt restraint in these moods She put her head on one side and tore
open the corner of the parcel just a little way

A tin can she said in a stage whisper

She enlarged the opening Blades of grass she said

The Professor tried to regard it humorously Even if you have ceased to
be decent you can still be frank I think now my dear you might
just straightforwardly undo the parcel

She did Twelve unsympathetic eyes surveyed the evidences of Bealbys
utter poverty

Hes coming cried Madeleine suddenly

Judy repacked hastily but it was a false alarm

I said hed mizzled said the Professor

And without washing up wailed Madeleine I couldnt have thought it
of him


                                   

But Bealby had not mizzled although he was conspicuously not in
evidence about the camp There was neither sight nor sound of him for
all the time they sat about the vestiges of their meal They talked of
him and of topics arising out of him and whether the captain should
telegraph to Lady Laxton Boy practically found Id rather just find
him said the captain and anyhow until we get hold of him we dont
know its her particular boy Then they talked of washingup and how
detestable it was And suddenly the two husbands seeing their
advantage renewed their proposals that the caravanners should put up at
the golflinks hotel and have baths and the comforts of civilization for
a night or soand anyhow walk thither for tea And as William had now
returnedhe was sitting on the turf afar off smoking a nastylooking
short clay pipethey rose up and departed But Captain Douglas and Miss
Philips for some reason did not go off exactly with the others but
strayed apart straying away more and more into a kind of solitude

First the four married people and then the two lovers disappeared over
the crest of the downs


                                   

For a time except for its distant sentinel the caravan seemed
absolutely deserted and then a clump of bramble against the wall of the
old chalk pit became agitated and a small rueful disillusioned
whitesmeared little Bealby crept back into the visible universe again
His heart was very heavy

The time had come to go

And he did not want to go He had loved the caravan He had adored
Madeleine

He would go but he would go beautifullytouchingly

He would wash up before he went he would make everything tidy he would
leave behind him a sense of irreparable loss

With a mournful precision he set about this undertaking If Mergleson
could have seen Mergleson would have been amazed

He made everything look wonderfully tidy

Then in the place where she had sat lying on her rug he found her
favourite book a small volume of Swinburnes poems very beautifully
bound Captain Douglas had given it to her

Bealby handled it with a kind of reverence So luxurious it was so
unlike the books in Bealbys world so altogether of her quality
Strange forces prompted him For a time he hesitated Then decision came
with a rush He selected a page drew the stump of a pencil from his
pocket wetted it very wet and breathing hard began to write that
traditional message Farewell Remember Art Bealby

To this he made an original addition I washt up before I went

Then he remembered that so far as this caravan went he was not Art
Bealby at all He renewed the wetness of his pencil and drew black lines
athwart the name of Art Bealby until it was quite unreadable then
across this again and pressing still deeper so that the subsequent pages
reechoed it he wrote these singular words Ed rightful Earl Shonts
Then he was ashamed and largely obliterated this by still more forcible
strokes Finally above it all plainly and nakedly he wrote Dick
Maltravers

He put down the book with a sigh and stood up

Everything was beautifully in order But could he not do something yet
There came to him the idea of wreathing the entire camping place with
boughs of yew It would look lovelyand significant He set to work At
first he toiled zealously but yew is tough to get and soon his hands
were painful He cast about for some easier way and saw beneath the
hind wheels of the caravan great green boughsone particularly a
splendid long branch It seemed to him that it would be possible to
withdraw this branch from the great heap of sticks and stones that
stayed up the hind wheels of the caravan It seemed to him that that was
so He was mistaken but that was his idea

He set to work to do it It was rather more difficult to manage than he
had supposed there were unexpected ramifications wider resistances
Indeed the thing seemed rooted

Bealby was a resolute youngster at bottom

He warmed to his task He tugged harder and harder


                                   

How various is the quality of humanity

About Bealby there was ever an imaginative touch he was capable of
romance of gallantries of devotion William was of a grosser clay
slave of his appetites a materialist Such men as William drive one to
believe in born inferiors in the existence of a lower sort in the
natural inequality of men

While Bealby was busy at his little gentle task of reparation a task
foolish perhaps and not too ably conceived but at any rate morally
gracious William had no thought in the world but the satisfaction of
those appetites that the consensus of all mankind has definitely
relegated to the lower category And which Heaven has relegated to the
lower regions of our frame He came now slinking towards the vestiges of
the caravanners picnic and no one skilled in the interpretation of the
human physiognomy could have failed to read the significance of the
tongue tip that drifted over his thin oblique lips He came so softly
towards the encampment that Bealby did not note him Partly William
thought of remnants of food but chiefly he was intent to drain the
bottles Bealby had stuck them all neatly in a row a little way up the
hill There was a cider bottle with some heeltaps of cider William
drank that then there was nearly half a bottle of hock and William
drank that then there were the drainings of the Burgundy and
Apollinaris It was all drink to William

And after he had drained each bottle William winked at the watching
angels and licked his lips and patted the lower centres of his being
with a shameless base approval Then fired by alcohol robbed of his
last vestiges of selfcontrol his thoughts turned to the delicious
chocolates that were stored in a daintily beribboned box in the little
drawers beneath the sleeping bunk of Miss Philips There was a new
brightness in his eye a spot of pink in either cheek With an
expression of the lowest cunning he reconnoitred Bealby

Bealby was busy about something at the back end of the caravan tugging
at something

With swift stealthy movements of an entirely graceless sort William got
up into the front of the caravan

Just for a moment he hesitated before going in He craned his neck to
look round the side at the unconscious Bealby wrinkled the vast nose
into an unpleasant grimace and thena crouching figure of appetitehe
crept inside

Here they were He laid his hand in the drawer halted listening

What was that

Suddenly the caravan swayed He stumbled and fear crept into his craven
soul The caravan lurched It was moving Its hind wheels came to the
ground with a crash

He took a step doorward and was pitched sideways and thrown upon his
knees Then he was hurled against the dresser and hit by a falling
plate A cup fell and smashed and the caravan seemed to leap and
bound

Through the little window he had a glimpse of yew bushes hurrying
upward The caravan was going down hill

Lummy said William clutching at the bunks to hold himself
upright

Caarnt be that drink said William aspread and aghast

He attempted the door

Crikey Here Hold in My shin  Tis thut Brasted Vool of a Boy

 said William 

Illustration    


                                   

The caravan party soon came to its decision They would stay the night
in the hotel And so as soon as they had had some tea they decided to go
back and make William bring the caravan and all the ladies things round
to the hotel With characteristic eagerness Professor Bowles led the
way

And so it was Professor Bowles who first saw the release of the caravan
He barked One short sharp bark Whup he cried and very quickly
Whatstheboydoing

Then quite a different style of noise with the mouth open Whahoop

Then he set off running very fast down towards the caravan waving his
arms and shouting as he ran Yaaps You Idiot Yaaps

The others were less promptly active

Down the slope they saw Bealby a little struggling active Bealby
tugging away at a yew branch until the caravan swayed with his efforts
and thenthen there was a movement as though the thing tossed its head
and reared and a smash as the heap of stuff that stayed up its hind
wheels collapsed

It plunged like a horse with a dog at its heels it lurched sideways
and then with an air of quiet deliberation started down the grass slope
to the road and WinthorpeSutbury

Professor Bowles sped in pursuit like the wind and Mrs Bowles after a
gasping moment set off after her lord her face round and resolute Mr
Geedge followed at a more dignified pace making the only really sound
suggestion that was offered on the occasion Hue Stop it cried Mr
Geedge for all the world like his great prototype at the Balkan
Conference And then like a large languid pair of scissors he began to
run Mrs Geedge after some indefinite moments decided to see the humour
of it all and followed after her lord in a fluttering rush emitting
careful little musical giggles as she ran giggles that she had learnt
long ago from a beloved schoolfellow Captain Douglas and Miss Philips
were some way behind the others and the situation had already developed
considerably before they grasped what was happening Then obeying the
instincts of a soldier the captain came charging to support the others
and Miss Madeleine Philips after some wasted gestures realized that
nobody was looking at her and sat down quietly on the turf until this
paralyzing state of affairs should cease

The caravan remained the centre of interest

Without either indecent haste or any complete pause it pursued its way
down the road towards the tranquil village below Except for the
rumbling of its wheels and an occasional concussion it made very little
sound once or twice there was a faint sound of breaking crockery from
its interior and once the phantom of an angry yell but that was all

There was an effect of discovered personality about the thing This
vehicle which had hitherto been content to play a background part a
yellow patch amidst the scenery was now revealing an individuality It
was purposeful and touched with a suggestion of playfulness at once
kindly and human it had its thoughtful instants its phases of quick
decision yet never once did it altogether lose a certain mellow
dignity There was nothing servile about it never for a moment for
example did it betray its blind obedience to gravitation It was rather
as if it and gravitation were going hand in hand It came out into the
road butted into the bank swept round meditated for a full second
and then shafts foremost headed downhill going quietly faster and
faster and swaying from bank to bank The shafts went before it like
arms held out

It had a qualityas if it were a favourite elephant running to a beloved
master from whom it had been overlong separated Or a slightly
intoxicated and altogether happy yellow guineapig making for some
coveted food

At a considerable distance followed Professor Bowles a miracle of
compact energy running so fast that he seemed only to touch the ground
at very rare intervals

And then dispersedly in their order and according to their natures
the others

There was fortunately very little on the road

There was a perambulator containing twins whose little girl guardian
was so fortunate as to be high up on the bank gathering blackberries

A ditcher ditching

A hawker lost in thought

His cart drawn by a poor little black screw of a pony and loaded with
the cheap flawed crockery that is so popular among the poor

A dog asleep in the middle of the village street Amidst this choice
of objects the caravan displayed a whimsical humanity It reduced the
children in the perambulator to tears but passed It might have reduced
them to a sort of redcurrant jelly It lurched heavily towards the
ditcher and spared him it chased the hawker up the bank it whipped off
a wheel from the cart of crockery which after an interval of
astonishment fell like a vast objurgation and then it directed its
course with a grim intentness towards the dog

It just missed the dog

He woke up not a moment too soon He fled with a yelp of dismay

And then the caravan careered on a dozen yards further lost energy
andthe only really undignified thing in its whole careerstood on its
head in a wide wet ditch It did this with just the slightest lapse into
emphasis There It was as if it gave a gruntand perhaps there was
the faintest suggestion of William in that gruntand then it became
quite still

For a time the caravan seemed finished and done Its steps hung from its
upper end like the tongue of a tired dog Except for a few minute noises
as though it was scratching itself inside it was as inanimate as death
itself

But up the hill road the twins were weeping the hawker and the ditcher
were saying raucous things the hawkers pony had backed into the ditch
and was taking illadvised steps for which it was afterwards to be
sorry amidst his stockintrade and Professor Bowles Mrs Bowles Mr
Geedge Captain Douglas and Mrs Geedge were runningrunningone heard
the various patter of their feet

And then came signs of life at the upward door of the caravan a hand
an arm an active investigating leg seeking a hold a large nose a
small intent vicious eye in factWilliam

William maddened

Professor Bowles had reached the caravan With a startling agility he
clambered up by the wheels and step and confronted the unfortunate
driver It was an occasion for mutual sympathy rather than anger but
the Professor was hasty efficient and unsympathetic with the lower
classes and Williams was an illregulated temperament

You consummate ass began Professor Bowles

When William heard Professor Bowles say this incontinently he smote him
in the face and when Professor Bowles was smitten in the face he
grappled instantly and very bravely and resolutely with William

For a moment they struggled fearfully they seemed to be endowed
instantaneously with innumerable legs and then suddenly they fell
through the door of the caravan into the interior their limbs seemed to
whirl for a wonderful instant and then they were swallowed up

The smash was tremendous You would not have thought there was nearly so
much in the caravan still left to get broken

A healing silence

At length smothered noises of still inadequate adjustment within

The village population in a state of scared delight appeared at a score
of points and converged upon the catastrophe Sounds of renewed
dissension between William and the Professor inside the rearing yellow
bulk promised further interests and added an element of mystery to this
manifest disaster


                                   

As Bealby still grasping his great branch of yew watched these events
a sense of human futility invaded his youthful mind For the first time
he realized the gulf between intention and result He had meant so
well

He perceived it would be impossible to explain

The thought of even attempting to explain things to Professor Bowles was
repellent to him

He looked about him with round despairful eyes He selected a direction
which seemed to promise the maximum of concealment with the minimum of
conversational possibility and in that direction and without needless
delay he set off eager to turn over an entirely fresh page in his
destiny as soon as possible

To get away the idea possessed all his being

From the crest of the downs a sweet voice floated after his retreating
form and never overtook him

Diick


                                   

Then presently Miss Philips arose to her feet gathered her skirts in
her hand and with her delicious chin raised and an expression of
countenance that was almost businesslike descended towards the
gathering audience below She wore wideflowing skirts and came down the
hill in Artemesian strides

It was high time that somebody looked at her




                               CHAPTER V
                         THE SEEKING OF BEALBY


                                   

On the same Monday evening that witnessed Bealbys first experience of
the theatre Mr Mergleson the house steward of Shonts walked slowly
and thoughtfully across the corner of the park between the laundry and
the gardens His face was much recovered from the accidents of his
collision with the Lord Chancellor resort to raw meat in the kitchen
had checked the development of his injuries and only a few contusions
in the side of his face were more than faintly traceable And suffering
had on the whole rather ennobled than depressed his bearing He had a
black eye but it was not he felt a common black eye It came from
high quarters and through no fault of Mr Merglesons own He carried it
well It was a fruit of duty rather than the outcome of wanton
pleasureseeking or misdirected passion

He found Mr Darling in profound meditation over some peach trees
against the wall They were not doing so well as they ought to do and
Mr Darling was engaged in wondering why

Good evening Mr Darling said Mr Mergleson

Mr Darling ceased rather slowly to wonder and turned to his friend
Good evening Mr Mergleson he said I dont quite like the look of
these here peaches blowed if I do

Mr Mergleson glanced at the peaches and then came to the matter that
was nearest his heart

You avent I suppose seen anything of your stepson these last two
days Mr Darling

Naturally not said Mr Darling putting his head on one side and
regarding his interlocutor Naturally notIve left that to you Mr
Mergleson

Well thats whats awkward said Mr Mergleson and then with a
forced easiness You see I aint seen im either

No

No I lost sight of im Mr Mergleson appeared to reflectlate on
Sattiday night

Ows that Mr Mergleson

Mr Mergleson considered the difficulties of lucid explanation We
missed im said Mr Mergleson simply regarding the wellweeded garden
path with a calculating expression and then lifting his eyes to Mr
Darlings with an air of great candour And we continue to miss him

Well said Mr Darling Thats rum

Yes said Mr Mergleson

Its decidedly rum said Mr Darling

We thought e might be iding from is work Or cut off ome

You didnt send down to ask

We was too busy with the weekend people On the ole we thought if e

the way at times And there was one or two things appened Now
that theyre all gone and e asnt turned upWell I came down Mr
Darling to arst you Wheres e gone

E aint come ere said Mr Darling surveying the garden

I arf expected e might and I arf expected e mightnt said Mr
Mergleson with the air of one who had anticipated Mr Darlings answer
but hesitated to admit as much

The two gentlemen paused for some seconds and regarded each other
searchingly

Wheres e got to said Mr Darling

Well said Mr Mergleson putting his hands where the tails of his
short jacket would have been if it hadnt been short and looking
extraordinarily like a parrot in its more thoughtful moods to tell you
the truth Mr Darling Ive ad a dream about imand it worries me I
got a sort of ideer of im as being in one of them secret passages
Iding away There was a guest well I say it with all respec but
anyone might ave id from im Smorning soon as the weekend ad
cleared up and gone ome me and Thomas went through them passages as
well as we could Not a trace of im But I still got that ideer E was
a wriggling climbingenterprising sort of boy

Ive checked im for it once or twice said Mr Darling with the red
light of fierce memories gleaming for a moment in his eyes

E might even said Mr Mergleson well very likely ave got imself
jammed in one of them secret passages

Jammed repeated Mr Darling

Wellgot imself somewhere where e cant get out Ive eard tell
theres walledup dungeons

They say said Mr Darling theres underground passages to the Abbey
ruinsthree good mile away

Orkward said Mr Mergleson

Drat is eyes said Mr Darling scratching his head What does e
mean by it

We cant leave im there said Mr Mergleson

I knowed a young devil once what crawled up a culvert said Mr
Darling Is father ad to dig im out like a fox Lord ow e
walloped im for it

Mistake to ave a boy in so young said Mr Mergleson

Its all very awkward said Mr Darling surveying every aspect of the
case You see Is mother sets a most estrordinary value on im Most
estrordinary

I dont know whether she oughtnt to be told said Mr Mergleson I
was thinking of that

Mr Darling was not the sort of man to meet trouble halfway He shook
his head at that Not yet Mr Mergleson I dont think yet Not until
everythings been tried I dont think theres any need to give her
needless distressnone whatever If you dont mind I think Ill come up
tonightnineish sayand ave a talk to you and Thomas about ita quiet
talk Best to begin with a quiet talk Its a dashed rum go and me
and you we got to think it out a bit

Thats what I think said Mr Mergleson with unconcealed relief at
Mr Darlings friendliness Thats exactly the light Mr Darling in
which it appears to me Because you seeif es all right and in the
ouse why doesnt e come for is vittels


                                   

In the pantry that evening the question of telling someone was discussed
further It was discussed over a number of glasses of Mr Merglesons
beer For following a sound tradition Mr Mergleson brewed at Shonts
and sometimes he brewed well and sometimes he brewed ill and sometimes
he brewed weak and sometimes he brewed strong and there was no monotony
in the cups at Shonts This was sturdy stuff and suited Mr Darlings
mood and ever and again with an authors natural weakness and an
affectation of abstraction Mr Mergleson took the jug out empty and
brought it back foaming

Henry the second footman was disposed to a forced hopefulness so as
not to spoil the evening but Thomas was sympathetic and distressed The
redhaired youth made cigarettes with a little machine licked them and
offered them to the others saying little as became him Etiquette
deprived him of an uninvited beer and Mr Merglesons inattention
completed what etiquette began

I cant bear to think of the poor little beggar stuck head foremost
into some cobwebby cranny blowed if I can said Thomas getting help
from the jug

He was an interesting kid said Thomas in a tone that was frankly
obituary He didnt like his work one could see that but he was
livelyand I tried to help him along all I could when I wasnt too busy
myself

There was something sensitive about him said Thomas

Mr Mergleson sat with his arms loosely thrown out over the table

What we got to do is to tell someone he said I dont see ow I can
put off telling er ladyshipafter tomorrow morning And theneaven
elp us

Course I got to tell my missis said Mr Darling and poured in a
preoccupied way some running over

Well go through them passages again now before we go to bed said Mr
Mergleson far as we can But theres oles and chinks ony a boy could
get through

I got to tell the missis said Mr Darling Thats whats worrying
me

As the evening wore on there was a tendency on the part of Mr Darling
to make this the refrain of his discourse He sought advice Owd you
tell the missis he asked Mr Mergleson and emptied a glass to control
his impatience before Mr Mergleson replied

I shall tell er ladyship just simply the fact I shall say your
ladyship heres my boy gone and we dont know where And as she arsts
me questions so shall I give particulars

Mr Darling reflected and then shook his head slowly

Owd ju tell the missis he asked Thomas

Glad I havent got to said Thomas Poor little beggar

Yes but ow would you tell er Mr Darling said varying the
accent very carefully

Id go to er and Id pat her back and Id say bear up see and
when she asked what for Id just tell her what forgradual like

You dont know the missis said Mr Darling Henry owd ju tell
er

Let er find out said Henry Wimmin do

Mr Darling reflected and decided that too was unworkable

Owd you he asked with an air of desperation of the redhaired
youth

The redhaired youth remained for a moment with his tongue extended
licking the gum of a cigarette paper and his eyes on Mr Darling Then
he finished the cigarette slowly giving his mind very carefully to the
question he had been honoured with I think he said in a low serious
voice I should say just simply Maryor Susanor whatever her name
is

Tilda supplied Mr Darling

Tilda I should say The Lord gave and the Lord ath taken away
Tildaes gone Somethin like that

The redhaired boy cleared his throat He was rather touched by his own
simple eloquence

Mr Darling reflected on this with profound satisfaction for some
moments Then he broke out almost querulously Yes but brast
himwheres e gone

Anyhow said Mr Darling I aint going to tell er not till the
morning I aint going to lose my nights rest if I have lost my
stepson Nohow Mr Mergleson I must say I dont think I ever ave
tasted better beer Never Itsits famous beer

He had some more

On his way back through the moonlight to the gardens Mr Darling was
still unsettled as to the exact way of breaking things to his wife He
had come out from the house a little ruffled because of Mr Merglesons
opposition to a rather good idea of his that he should go about the
house and holler for im a bit Hed know my voice you see Ladyship
wouldnt mind Very likely sleep by now But the moonlight dispelled
his irritation

How was he to tell his wife He tried various methods to the listening
moon

There was for example the offhand newsy way You know tha boy yours
Then a pause for the reply Then Es toley dispeared

Only there are difficulties about the word totally

Or the distressed impersonal manner Drefle thing happend Drefle
thing Tha poo lill chap Artietoley dispeared

Totally again

Or the personal intimate note Dunno wha youll say tme Tilda when
you hear whattogottasay Thurly bad news Seems they los our Artie up
thereclean los im Cant fine im nowhere tall

Or the authoritative kindly Tildayou go control yourself Go show
whad you made of Our boyeshiclos

Then he addressed the park at large with a sudden despair Don care
wha I say shell blame it on to me I know er

After that the enormous pathos of the situation got hold of him Poor
lill chap he said Poor lill fell and shed a few natural tears

Loved im jessis mione son

As the circumambient night made no reply he repeated the remark in a
louder almost domineering tone

He spent some time trying to climb the garden wall because the door did
not seem to be in the usual place Have to enquire about that in the
morning Difficult to see everything is all right when one is so
bereaved But finally he came on the door round a corner

He told his wife merely that he intended to have a peaceful night and
took off his boots in a defiant and intermittent manner

The morning would be soon enough

She looked at him pretty hard and he looked at her ever and again but
she never made a guess at it

Bed


                                   

So soon as the weekenders had dispersed and Sir Peter had gone off to
London to attend to various matters affecting the peptonizing of milk
and the distribution of baby soothers about the habitable globe Lady
Laxton went back to bed and remained in bed until midday on Tuesday
Nothing short of complete rest and the utmost kindness from her maid
would she felt save her from a nervous breakdown of the most serious
description The festival had been stormy to the end Sir Peters
illadvised attempts to deprive Lord Moggeridge of alcohol had led to a
painful struggle at lunch and this had been followed by a still more
unpleasant scene between host and guest in the afternoon This is an
occasion for tact Sir Peter had said and had gone off to tackle the
Lord Chancellor leaving his wife to the direst best founded
apprehensions For Sir Peters tact was a thing by itself a mixture of
misconception recrimination and familiarity that was rarely well
received

She had had to explain to the Sunday dinner party that his lordship had
been called away suddenly Something connected with the Great Seal
Lady Laxton had whispered in a discreet mysterious whisper One or two
simple hearers were left with the persuasion that the Great Seal had
been taken suddenly unwelland probably in a slightly indelicate manner
Thomas had to paint Merglesons eye with greasepaint left over from
some private theatricals It had been a patchedup affair altogether
and before she retired to bed that night Lady Laxton had given way to
her accumulated tensions and wept

There was no reason whatever why to wind up the day Sir Peter should
have stayed in her room for an hour saying what he thought of Lord
Moggeridge She felt she knew quite well enough what he thought of Lord
Moggeridge and on these occasions he always used a number of words that
she did her best to believe as a delicately brought up woman were
unfamiliar to her ears

So on Monday as soon as the guests had gone she went to bed again and
stayed there trying as a good woman should to prevent herself thinking
of what the neighbours could be thinkingand sayingof the whole affair
by studying a new and very circumstantial pamphlet by Bishop Fowle on
social evils turning over the moving illustrations of some recent
antivivisection literature and rereading the accounts in the morning
papers of a colliery disaster in the north of England

To such women as Lady Laxton brought up in an atmosphere of refinement
that is almost colourless and living a life troubled only by small
social conflicts and the minor violence of Sir Peter blameless to the
point of complete uneventfulness and secure and comfortable to the
point of tedium there is something amounting to fascination in the
wickedness and sufferings of more normally situated people there is a
real attraction and solace in the thought of pain and stress and as her
access to any other accounts of vice and suffering was restricted she
kept herself closely in touch with the more explicit literature of the
various movements for human moralization that distinguish our age and
responded eagerly and generously to such painful catastrophes as enliven
it The counterfoils of her cheque book witnessed to her gratitude for
these vicarious sensations She figured herself to herself in her day
dreams as a calm and white and shining intervention checking and
reproving amusements of an undesirable nature and earning the tearful
blessings of the mangled byproducts of industrial enterprise

There is a curious craving for entire reality in the feminine
composition and there were times when in spite of these feasts of
particulars she wished she could come just a little nearer to the heady
dreadfulnesses of life than simply writing a cheque against it She
would have liked to have actually seen the votaries of evil blench and
repent before her contributions to have herself unstrapped and
revived and pitied some doomed and chloroformed victim of the socalled
scientist to have herself participated in the stretcher and the
hospital and humanity made marvellous by enlistment under the redcross
badge But Sir Peters ideals of womanhood were higher than his
language and he would not let her soil her refinement with any vision
of the pain and evil in the world Sort of woman they want up there is
a Trained Nurse he used to say when she broached the possibility of
going to some famine or disaster You dont want to go prying old
girl

She suffered she felt from repressed heroism If ever she was to shine
in disaster that disaster she felt must come to her she might not go
to meet it and so you realize how deeply it stirred her how it
brightened her and uplifted her to learn from Mr Merglesons halting
statements that perhaps that probably that almost certainly a painful
and tragical thing was happening even now within the walls of Shonts
that there was urgent necessity for actionif anguish was to be
witnessed before it had ended and life saved

She clasped her hands she surveyed her large servitor with agonized
greengrey eyes

Something must be done at once she said Everything possible must be
done Poor little Mite

Of course my lady e may ave run away

Oh no she cried he hasnt run away He hasnt run away How can you
be so wicked Mergleson Of course he hasnt run away Hes there now
And its too dreadful

She became suddenly very firm and masterful The mornings colliery
tragedy inspired her imagination

We must get pickaxes she said We must organize search parties Not
a moment is to be lost Merglesonnot a moment Get the men in off
the roads Get everyone you can

And not a moment was lost The road men were actually at work in Shonts
before their proper dinnerhour was over

They did quite a lot of things that afternoon Every passage attainable
from the diningroom opening was explored and where these passages gave
off chinks and crannies they were opened up with a vigour which Lady
Laxton had greatly stimulated by an encouraging presence and liberal
doses of whisky Through their efforts a fine new opening was made into
the library from the wall near the window a hole big enough for a man
to fall through because one did and a great piece of stonework was
thrown down from the Queen Elizabeth tower exposing the upper portion
of the secret passage to the light of day Lady Laxton herself and the
head housemaid went round the panelling with a hammer and a chisel and
called out Are you there and attempted an opening wherever it sounded
hollow The sweep was sent for to go up the old chimneys outside the
present flues Meanwhile Mr Darling had been set with several of his
men to dig for discover pick up and lay open the underground passage
or disused drain whichever it was that was known to run from the
corner of the laundry towards the old icehouse and that was supposed
to reach to the abbey ruins After some bold exploratory excavations
this channel was located and a report sent at once to Lady Laxton

It was this and the new and alarming scar on the Queen Elizabeth tower
that brought Mr Beaulieu Plummer posthaste from the estate office up
to the house Mr Beaulieu Plummer was the Marquis of Cranberrys estate
agent a man of great natural tact and charged among other duties with
the task of seeing that the Laxtons did not make away with Shonts during
the period of their tenancy He was a sound compact little man rarely
out of extreme riding breeches and gaiters and he wore glasses that
now glittered with astonishment as he approached Lady Laxton and her
band of spade workers

At his approach Mr Darling attempted to become invisible but he was
unable to do so

Lady Laxton Mr Beaulieu Plummer appealed may I ask

Oh Mr Beaulieu Plummer Im so glad youve come A little
boysuffocating I can hardly bear it

Suffocating cried Mr Beaulieu Plummer where and was in a
confused manner told

He asked a number of questions that Lady Laxton found very tiresome But
how did she know the boy was in the secret passage Of course she
knew was it likely she would do all this if she didnt know But
mightnt he have run away How could he when he was in the secret
passages But why not first scour the countryside By which time he
would be smothered and starved and dead

They parted with a mutual loss of esteem and Mr Beaulieu Plummer
looking very serious indeed ran as fast as he could straight to the
village telegraphoffice Or to be more exact he walked until he
thought himself out of sight of Lady Laxton and then he took to his
heels and ran He sat for some time in the parlour post office spoiling
telegraph forms and composing telegrams to Sir Peter Laxton and Lord
Cranberry

He got these off at last and then drawn by an irresistible fascination
went back to the park and watched from afar the signs of fresh
activities on the part of Lady Laxton

He saw men coming from the direction of the stables with large rakes
With these they dragged the ornamental waters

Then a man with a pickaxe appeared against the skyline and crossed the
roof in the direction of the clock tower bound upon some unknown but
probably highly destructive mission

Then he saw Lady Laxton going off to the gardens She was going to
console Mrs Darling in her trouble This she did through nearly an hour
and a half And on the whole it seemed well to Mr Beaulieu Plummer that
so she should be occupied

It was striking five when a telegraph boy on a bicycle came up from the
village with a telegram from Sir Peter Laxton

Stop all proceedings absolutely it said until I get to you

Lady Laxtons lips tightened at the message She was back from much
weeping with Mrs Darling and altogether finely strung Here she felt
was one of those supreme occasions when a woman must assert herself A
matter of life or death she wired in reply and to show herself how
completely she overrode such dictation as this she sent Mr Mergleson
down to the village publichouse with orders to engage anyone he could
find there for an evenings work on an extraordinarily liberal overtime
scale

After taking this step the spirit of Lady Laxton quailed She went and
sat in her own room and quivered She quivered but she clenched her
delicate fist

She would go through with it come what might she would go on with the
excavation all night if necessary but at the same time she began a
little to regret that she had not taken earlier steps to demonstrate the
improbability of Bealby having simply run away She set to work to
repair this omission She wrote off to the Superintendent of Police in
the neighbouring town to the nearest police magistrate and then on the
off chance to various of her weekend guests including Captain Douglas
If it was true that he had organized the annoyance of the Lord
Chancellor and though she still rejected that view she did now begin to
regard it as a permissible hypothesis then he might also know
something about the mystery of this boys disappearance

Each letter she wrote she wrote with greater fatigue and haste than its
predecessor and more illegibly

Sir Peter arrived long after dark He cut across the corner of the park
to save time and fell into one of the trenches that Mr Darling had
opened This added greatly to the clat with which he came into the
hall

Lady Laxton withstood him for five minutes and then returned abruptly to
her bedroom and locked herself in leaving the control of the operations
in his hands

If hes not in the house said Sir Peter all this is thunderin
foolery and if hes in the house hes dead If hes dead hell smell in
a bit and thenll be the time to look for him Somethin to go upon
instead of all this blind hacking the place about No wonder theyre
threatenin proceedings


                                   

Upon Captain Douglas Lady Laxtons letter was destined to have a very
distracting effect Because as he came to think it over as he came to
put her partly illegible allusions to secret passages and a missing boy
side by side with his memories of Lord Moggeridges accusations and the
general mystery of his expulsion from Shonts it became more and more
evident to him that he had here something remarkably like a clue
something that might serve to lift the black suspicion of irreverence
and levity from his military reputation And he had already got to the
point of suggesting to Miss Philips that he ought to follow up and
secure Bealby forthwith before ever they came over the hill crest to
witness the disaster to the caravan

Captain Douglas it must be understood was a young man at war within
himself

He had been very nicely brought up firstly in a charming English home
then in a preparatory school for selected young gentlemen then in a
good set at Eton then at Sandhurst where the internal trouble had
begun to manifest itself Afterwards the Bistershires

There were three main strands in the composition of Captain Douglas In
the first place and what was peculiarly his own quality was the
keenest interest in the why of things and the how of things and the
general mechanism of things He was fond of clocks curious about
engines eager for science he had a quick brain and nimble hands He
read Jules Verne and liked to think about going to the stars and making
flying machines and submarinesin those days when everybody knew quite
certainly that such things were impossible His brain teemed with larval
ideas that only needed air and light to become active fullfledged
ideas There he excelled most of us In the next place but this second
strand was just a strand that most young men have he had a natural keen
interest in the other half of humanity he thought them lovely
interesting wonderful and they filled him with warm curiosities and
set his imagination cutting the prettiest capers And in the third
place and there again he was ordinarily human he wanted to be liked
admired approved well thought of And so constituted he had passed
through the educational influence of that English home that preparatory
school the good set at Eton the Sandhurst discipline the Bistershire
mess

Now the educational influence of the English home the preparatory
school the good set at Eton and Sandhurst in those daysthough
Sandhurst has altered a little sincewas all to develop that third chief
strand of his being to the complete suppression of the others to make
him look well and unobtrusive dress well and unobtrusively behave well
and unobtrusively carry himself well play games reasonably well do
nothing else well and in the best possible form And the two brothers
Douglas who were really very much alike did honestly do their best to
be such plain and simple gentlemen as our country demands taking
pretentious established things seriously and not being odd or
intelligentin spite of those insurgent strands

But the strands were in them Below the surface the disturbing impulses
worked and at last forced their way out

In one Captain Douglas as Mrs Rampound Pilby told the Lord Chancellor
the suppressed ingenuity broke out in disconcerting mystifications and
practical jokes that led to a severance from Portsmouth in the other
the pentup passions came out before the other ingredients in an
uncontrollable devotion to the obvious and challenging femininity of
Miss Madeleine Philips His training had made him proof against
ordinary women deaf as it were to their charms but sheshe had
penetrated And impulsive forces that have been pent upgo with a bang
when they go

The first strand in the composition of Captain Douglas has still to be
accounted for the sinister strain of intelligence and inventiveness and
lively curiosity On that he had kept a warier hold So far that had not
been noted against him He had his motor bicycle it is true at a time
when motor bicycles were on the verge of the caddish to that extent a
watchful eye might have found him suspicious that was all that showed
I wish I could add it was all that there was but other thingsother
things were going on Nobody knew about them But they were going on
more and more

He read books

Not decent fiction not official biographies about other fellows
fathers and all the old anecdotes brought up to date and so on but
books with ideasyou know philosophy social philosophy scientific
stuff all that rot The sort of stuff they read in mechanics
institutes

He thought He could have controlled it But he did not attempt to
control it He tried to think He knew perfectly well that it wasnt
good form but a vicious attraction drew him on

He used to sit in his bedroomstudy at Sandhurst with the door locked
and write down on a bit of paper what he really believed and why He
would cut all sorts of things to do this He would questionthings no
properly trained English gentleman ever questions

Andhe experimented

This you know was long before the French and American aviators It was
long before the coming of that emphatic lead from abroad without which
no wellbred English mind permits itself to stir In the darkest secrecy
he used to make little models of cane and paper and elastic in the hope
that somehow he would find out something about flying Flyingthat
dream He used to go off by himself to lonely places and climb up as
high as he could and send these things fluttering earthward He used to
moon over them and muse about them If anyone came upon him suddenly
while he was doing these things he would sit on his model or pretend
it didnt belong to him or clap it into his pocket whichever was most
convenient and assume the vacuous expression of a wellbred gentleman
at leisureand so far nobody had caught him But it was a dangerous
practice

And finally and this now is the worst and last thing to tell of his
eccentricities he was keenly interested in the science of his
profession and intensely ambitious

He thoughtthough it wasnt his business to think the business of a
junior officer is to obey and look a credit to his regimentthat the
military science of the British army was not nearly so bright as it
ought to be and that if big trouble came there might be considerable
scope for an inventive man who had done what he could to keep abreast
with foreign work and a considerable weeding out of generals whose
promotion had been determined entirely by their seniority amiability
and unruffled connubial felicity He thought that the field artillery
would be found outthere was no good in making a fuss about it
beforehandthat no end of neglected dodges would have to be picked up
from the enemy that the transport was feeble and a health
serviceother than surgery and ambulancean unknown idea but he saw no
remedy but experience So he worked hard in secret he worked almost as
hard as some confounded foreigner might have done in the belief that
after the first horrid smashup there might be a chance to do things

Outwardly of course he was sedulously all right But he could not quite
hide the stir in his mind It broke out upon his surface in a chattering
activity of incompleted sentences which he tried to keep as decently
silly as he could He had done his utmost hitherto to escape the
observation of the powers that were His infatuation for Madeleine
Philips had at any rate distracted censorious attention from these
deeper infamies

And now here was a crisis in his life Through some idiotic entanglement
manifestly connected with this missing boy he had got tarred by his
brothers brush and was under grave suspicion for liveliness and
disrespect

The thing might be his professional ruin And he loved the suppressed
possibilities of his work beyond measure

It was a thing to make him absentminded even in the company of
Madeleine


                                   

Not only were the first and second strands in the composition of Captain
Douglas in conflict with all his appearances and pretensions but they
were also in conflict with one another

He was full of that concealed resolve to do and serve and accomplish
great things in the world That was surely purpose enough to hide behind
an easygoing unpretending gentlemanliness But he was also tremendously
attracted by Madeleine Philips more particularly when she was not
there

A beautiful woman may be the inspiration of a great career This
however he was beginning to find was not the case with himself He had
believed it at first and written as much and said as much and said it
very variously and gracefully But becoming more and more distinctly
clear to his intelligence was the fact that the very reverse was the
case Miss Madeleine Philips was making it very manifest to Captain
Douglas that she herself was a career that a lover with any other
career in view need notas the advertisements sayapply

And the time she took up

The distress of being with her

And the distress of not being with her

She was such a proud and lovely and entrancing and distressing being to
remember and such a vain and difficult thing to be with

She knew clearly that she was made for love for she had made herself
for love and she went through life like its empress with all mankind
and numerous women at her feet And she had an ideal of the lover who
should win her which was like a oleographic copy of a Laszlo portrait of
Douglas greatly magnified He was to rise rapidly to great things he
was to be a conqueror and administrator while attending exclusively to
her And incidentally she would gather desperate homage from all other
men of mark and these attentions would be an added glory to her love
for him At first Captain Douglas had been quite prepared to satisfy all
these requirements He had met her at Shorncliffe for her people were
quite good military people and he had worshipped his way straight to
her feet He had made the most delightfully simple and delicate love to
her He had given up his secret vice of thinking for the writing of
quite surprisingly clever loveletters and the little white paper
models had ceased for a time to flutter in lonely places

And then the thought of his career returned to him from a new aspect
as something he might lay at her feet And once it had returned to him
it remained with him

Some day he said and it may not be so very long some of those
scientific chaps will invent flying Then the army will have to take it
up you know

I should love she said to soar through the air

He talked one day of going on active service How would it affect them
if he had to do so It was a necessary part of a soldiers lot

But I should come too she said I should come with you

It might not be altogether convenient he said for already he had
learnt that Madeleine Philips usually travelled with quite a large
number of trunks and considerable impressiveness

Of course she said it would be splendid How could I let you go
alone You would be the great general and I should be with you always

Not always very comfortable he suggested

Silly boyI shouldnt mind that How little you know me Any
hardship

A womanif she isnt a nurse

I should come dressed as a man I would be your groom

He tried to think of her dressed as a man but nothing on earth could
get his imagination any further than a vision of her dressed as a
Principal Boy She was so delightfully and valiantly not virile her
hair would have flowed her body would have moved a richly fluent
femininityvisible through any disguise


                                   

That was in the opening stage of the controversy between their careers
In those days they were both acutely in love with each other Their
friends thought the spectacle quite beautiful they went together so
well Admirers fluttered with the pride of participation asked them
for weekends together those theatrical weekends that begin on Sunday
morning and end on Monday afternoon She confided widely

And when at last there was something like a rupture it became the
concern of a large circle of friends

The particulars of the breach were differently stated It would seem
that looking ahead he had announced his intention of seeing the French
army manuvres just when it seemed probable that she would be out of an
engagement

But I ought to see what they are doing he said Theyre going to try
those new dirigibles

Then should she come

He wanted to whisk about It wouldnt be any fun for her They might get
landed at nightfall in any old hole And besides people would talk
Especially as it was in France One could do unconventional things in
England one couldnt in France Atmosphere was different

For a time after that halting explanation she maintained a silence Then
she spoke in a voice of deep feeling She perceived she said that he
wanted his freedom She would be the last person to hold a reluctant
lover to her side He might goto any manuvres He might go if he
wished round the world He might go away from her for ever She would
not detain him cripple him hamper a career she had once been assured
she inspired

The unfortunate man torn between his love and his profession protested
that he hadnt meant that

Then what had he meant

He realized he had meant something remarkably like it and he found great
difficulty in expressing these fine distinctions

She banished him from her presence for a month said he might go to his
manuvreswith her blessing As for herself that was her own affair
Some day perhaps he might know more of the heart of a woman She
choked back tearsvery beautifully and military science suddenly became
a trivial matter But she was firm He wanted to go He must go For a
month anyhow

He went sadly

Into this opening breach rushed friends It was the inestimable triumph
of Judy Bowles to get there first To begin with Madeleine confided in
her and then availing herself of the privilege of a distant
cousinship she commanded Douglas to tea in her Knightsbridge flat and
had a good straight talk with him She liked good straight talks with
honest young men about their love affairs it was almost the only form
of flirtation that the Professor who was a fierce tough
undiscriminating man upon the essentials of matrimony permitted her
And there was something peculiarly gratifying about Douglass
complexion Under her guidance he was induced to declare that he could
not live without Madeleine that her love was the heart of his life
without it he was nothing and with it he could conquer the world
Judy permitted herself great protestations on behalf of Madeleine and
Douglas was worked up to the pitch of kissing her intervening hand He
had little silvery hairs she saw all over his temples And he was such
a simple perplexed dear It was a rich deep beautiful afternoon for
Judy

And then in a very obvious way Judy who was already deeply in love with
the idea of a caravan tour and the wind on the heath and the Gipsy
life and the open road and all the rest of it worked this charming
little love difficulty into her scheme utilized her reluctant husband
to arrange for the coming of Douglas confided in Mrs Geedge

And Douglas went off with his perplexities He gave up all thought of
France weekended at Shonts instead to his own grave injury returned
to London unexpectedly by a Sunday train packed for France and started
He reached Rheims on Monday afternoon And then the image of Madeleine
which always became more beautiful and mysterious and commanding with
every mile he put between them would not let him go on He made
unconvincing excuses to the Daily Excess military expert with whom he
was to have seen things Theres a woman in it my boy and youre a
fool to go said the Daily Excess man but of course youll go and
I for one dont blame you He hurried back to London and was at Judys
trystingplace even as Judy had anticipated

And when he saw Madeleine standing in the sunlight pleased and proud
and glorious with a smile in her eyes and trembling on her lips with a
strand or so of her beautiful hair and a streamer or so of delightful
blue fluttering in the wind about her gracious form it seemed to him
for the moment that leaving the manuvres and coming back to England was
quite a right and almost a magnificent thing to do


                                   

This meeting was no exception to their other meetings

The coming to her was a crescendo of poetical desire the sight of her a
climax and thenan accumulation of irritations He had thought being
with her would be pure delight and as they went over the down straying
after the Bowles and the Geedges towards the Redlake Hotel he already
found himself rather urgently asking her to marry him and being annoyed
by what he regarded as her evasiveness

He walked along with the restrained movement of a decent Englishman he
seemed as it were to gesticulate only through his clenched teeth and
she floated beside him in a wonderful blue dress that with a wonderful
foresight she had planned for breezy uplands on the basis of
Botticellis Primavera He was urging her to marry him soon he needed
her he could not live in peace without her It was not at all what he
had come to say he could not recollect that he had come to say
anything but now that he was with her it was the only thing he could
find to say to her

But my dearest boy she said how are we to marry What is to become
of your career and my career

Ive left my career cried Captain Douglas with the first clear note
of irritation in his voice

Oh dont let us quarrel she cried Dont let us talk of all those
distant things Let us be happy Let us enjoy just this lovely day and
the sunshine and the freshness and the beauty Because you know we
are snatching these days We have so few days together Eacheach must
be a gem Look dear how the breeze sweeps through these tall dry
stems that stick up everywherelow broad ripples

She was a perfect work of art abolishing time and obligations

For a time they walked in silence Then Captain Douglas said All very
wellbeauty and all thatbut a fellow likes to know where he is

She did not answer immediately and then she said I believe you are
angry because you have come away from France

Not a bit of it said the Captain stoutly Id come away from
anywhere to be with you

I wonder she said

Wellhavent I

I wonder if you ever are with me OhI know you want me I know
you desire me But the real thing the happinesslove What is anything
to loveanything at all

In this strain they continued until their footsteps led them through the
shelter of a group of beeches And there the gallant captain sought
expression in deeds He kissed her hands he sought her lips She
resisted softly

No she said only if you love me with all your heart

Then suddenly wonderfully conqueringly she yielded him her lips

Oh she sighed presently if only you understood

And leaving speech at that enigma she kissed again

But you see now how difficult it was under these mystically loving
conditions to introduce the idea of a prompt examination and dispatch of
Bealby Already these days were consecrated

And then you see Bealby vanishedgoing seaward

Even the crash of the caravan disaster did little to change the
atmosphere In spite of a certain energetic quality in the Professors
direction of the situationhe was a little embittered because his thumb
was sprained and his knee bruised rather badly and he had a slight
abrasion over one ear and William had bitten his calfthe general
disposition was to treat the affair hilariously Nobody seemed really
hurt except Williamthe Professor was not so much hurt as annoyedand
Williams injuries though striking were all superficial a sprained jaw
and grazes and bruises and little things like that everybody was
heartened up to the idea of damages to be paid for and neither the
internal injuries to the caravan nor the hawkers estimate of his
stockintrade proved to be as great as one might reasonably have
expected Before sunset the caravan was safely housed in the
WinthorpeSutbury public house William had found a congenial corner in
the bar parlour where his account of an inside view of the catastrophe
and his views upon Professor Bowles were much appreciated the hawker
had made a bit extra by carting all the luggage to the Redlake Royal
Hotel and the caravanners and their menfolk had loitered harmoniously
back to this refuge Madeleine had walked along the road beside Captain
Douglas and his motor bicycle which he had picked up at the now
desolate encampment

It only remains she said for that thing to get broken

But I may want it he said

No she said Heaven has poured us together and now He has smashed
the vessels At least He has smashed one of the vessels And looklike
a great shield there is the moon Its the Harvest Moon isnt it

No said the Captain with his poetry running away with him Its the
Lovers Moon

Its like a benediction rising over our meeting

And it was certainly far too much like a benediction for the Captain to
talk about Bealby

That night was a perfect night for lovers a night flooded with a kindly
radiance so that the warm mystery of the centre of life seemed to lurk
in every shadow and hearts throbbed instead of beating and eyes were
stars After dinner every one found wraps and slipped out into the
moonlight the Geedges vanished like moths the Professor made no secret
that Judy was transfigured for him Night works these miracles The only
other visitors there a brace of couples resorted to the boats upon the
little lake

Two enormous waiters removing the coffee cups from the small tables upon
the verandah heard Madeleines beautiful voice for a little while and
then it was stilled


                                   

The morning found Captain Douglas in a state of reaction He was anxious
to explain quite clearly to Madeleine just how necessary it was that he
should go in search of Bealby forthwith He was beginning to realize now
just what a chance in the form of Bealby had slipped through his
fingers He had dropped Bealby and now the thing to do was to pick up
Bealby again before he was altogether lost Her professional life
unfortunately had given Miss Philips the habit of never rising before
midday and the Captain had to pass the time as well as he could until
the opportunity for his explanation came

A fellow couldnt go off without an explanation

He passed the time with Professor Bowles upon the golf links

The Professor was a firstrate player and an unselfish one he wanted
all other players to be as good as himself He would spare no pains to
make them so If he saw them committing any of the many errors into
which golfers fall he would tell them of it and tell them why it was an
error and insist upon showing them just how to avoid it in future He
would point out any want of judgment and not confine himself as so
many professional golf teachers do merely to the stroke After a time
he found it necessary to hint to the Captain that nowadays a military
man must accustom himself to selfcontrol The Captain kept Pishing and
Tushing and presently it was only too evident swearing softly his
play got jerky his strokes were forcible without any real strength
once he missed the globe altogether and several times he sliced badly
The eyes under his light eyelashes were wicked little things

He remembered that he had always detested golf

And the Professor He had always detested the Professor

And his caddie at least he would have always detested his caddie if he
had known him long enough His caddie was one of those maddening boys
with no expression at all It didnt matter what he did or failed to do
there was the silly idiot with his stuffed face unmoved Really of
course overjoyedbut apparently unmoved

Why did I play it that way the Captain repeated Oh because I like
to play it that way

Well said the Professor It isnt a recognized way anyhow

Then came a moment of evil pleasures

Hed sliced Old Bowles had sliced For once in a while hed muffed
something Always teaching others and here he was slicing Why
sometimes the Captain didnt slice

Hed get out of that neatly enough Luck Hed get the hole yet What a
bore it all was

Why couldnt Madeleine get up at a decent hour to see a fellow Why must
she lie in bed when she wasnt acting If she had got up all this
wouldnt have happened The shame of it Here he was an ablebodied
capable man in the prime of life and the morning of a day playing this
blockheads game

Yesblockheads game

You play the like said the Professor

Rather said the Captain and addressed himself to his stroke

Thats not your ball said the Professor

Similar position said the Captain

You know you might win this hole said the Professor

Who cares said the Captain under his breath and putted extravagantly

That saves me said the Professor and went down from a distance of
twelve yards

The Captain full of an irrational resentment did his best to halve the
hole and failed

You ought to put in a week at nothing but putting said the Professor
It would save you at least a stroke a hole Ive noticed that on almost
every green if I havent beaten you before I pull up in the putting

The Captain pretended not to hear and said a lot of rococo things inside
himself

It was Madeleine who had got him in for this game A beautiful healthy
girl ought to get up in the mornings Mornings and beautiful healthy
girls are all the same thing really She ought to be dewypositively
dewy There she must be lying warm and beautiful in bedlike
Catherine the Great or somebody of that sort No It wasnt right All
very luxurious and so on but not right She ought to have understood
that he was bound to fall a prey to the Professor if she didnt get up
Golf Here he was neglecting his career hanging about on these
beastly links all the sound men away there in Franceit didnt do to
think of itand he was playing this retired tradesmans consolation

Beastly the Professors legs looked from behind The uglier a mans
legs are the better he plays golf Its almost a law

Thats what it was a retired tradesmans consolation A decent British
soldier has no more business to be playing golf than he has to be
dressing dolls Its a game at once worthless and exasperating If a man
isnt perfectly fit he cannot play golf and when he is perfectly fit he
ought to be doing a mans work in the world If ever anything deserved
the name of vice if ever anything was pure unforgivable dissipation
surely golf was that thing

And meanwhile that boy was getting more and more start Anyone with a
haporth of sense would have been up at five and after that bratmight
have had him bagged and safe and back to lunch Ass one was at times

Youre here sir said the caddie

The captain perceived he was in a nasty place open green ahead but with
some tumbled country near at hand and to the left a rusty old gravel
pit furze at the sides water at the bottom Nasty attractive hole of a
place Sort of thing one gets into He must pull himself together for
this After all having undertaken to play a game one must play the
game If he hit the infernal thing that is to say the ball if he hit
the ball so that if it didnt go straight it would go to the right
ratherclear of the hedge it wouldnt be so bad to the right Difficult
to manage Best thing was to think hard of the green ahead a long way
aheadwith just the slightest deflection to the right Now thenheels
well down club up a good swing keep your eye on the ball keep your
eye on the ball keep your eye on the ball just where you mean to hit
itfar below there and a little to the rightand dont worry

Rap

In the pond I think sir

The water would have splashed if it had gone in the pond said the
Professor It must be over there in the wet sand You hit it pretty
hard I thought

Search The caddie looked as though he didnt care whether he found it
or not He ought to be interested It was his profession not just his
game But nowadays everybody had this horrid disposition towards
slacking A Tired generation we are The world is too much with us Too
much to think about too much to do Madeleines army manuvres angry
lawyers lost boyslet alone such exhausting foolery as this game

Got it sir said the caddie

Where

Here sir Up in the bush sir

It was resting in the branches of a bush two yards above the slippery
bank

I doubt if you can play it said the Professor but it will be
interesting to try

The Captain scrutinized the position I can play it he said

Youll slip Im afraid said the Professor

They were both right Captain Douglas drove his feet into the steep
slope of rusty sand below the bush held his iron a little short and
wiped the ball up and over and as he found afterwards out of the rough
All eyes followed the ball except his The Professor made sounds of
friendly encouragement But the Captain was goinggoing He was on all
fours he scrabbled handfuls of prickly gorse of wet sand His feet
his ankles his calves slid into the pond How much more No Hed
reached the bottom He proceeded to get out again as well as he could
Not so easy The bottom of the pond sucked at him

When at last he rejoined the other three his hands were sandy red his
knees were sandy red his feet were of clay but his face was like the
face of a little child Like the face of a little fair child after it
has been boiled red in its bath and then dusted over with white powder
His ears were the colour of roses Lancaster roses And his eyes too had
something of the angry wonder of a little child distressed

I was afraid youd slip into the pond said the Professor

I didnt said the Captain



I just got in to see how deep it was and cool my feetI hate warm
feet

He lost that hole but he felt a better golfer now his anger he thought
was warming him up so that he would presently begin to make strokes by
instinct and do remarkable things unawares After all there is
something in the phrase getting ones blood up If only the Professor
wouldnt dally so with his ball and let ones blood get down again
Tapthe Professors ball went soaring Now for it The Captain
addressed himself to his task altered his plans rather hastily smote
and topped the ball

The least one could expect was a sympathetic silence But the Professor
thought fit to improve the occasion

Youll never drive said the Professor youll never drive with that
irritable jerk in the middle of the stroke You might just as well
smack the ball without raising your club If you think

The Captain lost his selfcontrol altogether

Look here he said if you think that I care a single rap about
how I hit the ball if you think that I really want to win and do well
at this beastly silly elderly childish game

He paused on the verge of ungentlemanly language

If a things worth doing at all said the Professor after a pause for
reflection its worth doing well

Then it isnt worth doing at all As this hole gives you the gameif
you dont mind

The Captains hot moods were so rapid that already he was acutely
ashamed of himself

O certainly if you wish it said the Professor

With a gesture the Professor indicated the altered situation to the
respectful caddies and the two gentlemen turned their faces towards the
hotel

For a time they walked side by side in silence the caddies following
with hushed expressions

Splendid weather for the French manuvres said the Captain presently
in an offhand tone that is to say if they are getting this weather

At present there are a series of high pressure systems over the whole
of Europe north of the Alps said the Professor It is as near set
fair as Europe can be

Fine weather for tramps and wanderers said the Captain after a
further interval

Theres a drawback to everything said the Professor But its very
lovely weather


                                   

They got back to the hotel about halfpast eleven and the Captain went
and had an unpleasant time with one of the tyres of his motor bicycle
which had got down in the night In replacing the tyre he pinched the
top of one of his fingers rather badly Then he got the ordnance map of
the district and sat at a green table in the open air in front of the
hotel windows and speculated on the probable flight of Bealby He had
been last seen going south by east That way lay the sea and all boy
fugitives go naturally for the sea

He tried to throw himself into the fugitives mind and work out just
exactly the course Bealby must take to the sea

For a time he found this quite an absorbing occupation

Bealby probably had no money or very little money Therefore he would
have to beg or steal He wouldnt go to the workhouse because he
wouldnt know about the workhouse respectable poor people never know
anything about the workhouse and the chances were he would be both too
honest and too timid to steal Hed beg Hed beg at front doors because
of dogs and things and hed probably go along a high road Hed be more
likely to beg from houses than from passersby because a door is at
first glance less formidable than a pedestrian and more accustomed to
being addressed And hed try isolated cottages rather than the village
street doors an isolated wayside cottage is so much more confidential
Hed ask for foodnot money All that seemed pretty sound

Now this road on the mapinto it he was bound to fall and along it he
would go begging No other No

In the fine weather hed sleep out And hed goten twelve
fourteenthirteen thirteen miles a day

So now he ought to be about here And tonighthere

Tomorrow at the same pacehere

But suppose he got a lift

Hed only get a slow lift if he got one at all It wouldnt make much
difference in the calculation

So if tomorrow one started and went on to these cross roads marked
Inn just about twentysix miles it must be by the scale and beat
round it one ought to get something in the way of tidings of Mr Bealby
Was there any reason why Bealby shouldnt go on south by east and
seaward

None

And now there remained nothing to do but to explain all this clearly to
Madeleine And why didnt she come down Why didnt she come down

But when one got Bealby what would one do with him

Wring the truth out of himhalf by threats and half by persuasion
Suppose after all he hadnt any connexion with the upsetting of Lord
Moggeridge He had Suppose he hadnt He had He had He had

And when one had the truth

Whisk the boy right up to London and confront the Lord Chancellor with
the facts But suppose he wouldnt be confronted with the facts He was
a touchy old sinner

For a time Captain Douglas balked at this difficulty Then suddenly
there came into his head the tall figure the long moustaches of that
kindly popular figure his adopted uncle Lord Chickney Suppose he took
the boy straight to Uncle Chickney told him the whole story Even the
Lord Chancellor would scarcely refuse ten minutes to General Lord
Chickney

The clearer the plans of Captain Douglas grew the more anxious he became
to put them before Madeleineclearly and convincingly

Because first he had to catch his boy

Presently as Captain Douglas fretted at the continued eclipse of
Madeleine his thumb went into his waistcoat pocket and found a piece of
paper He drew it out and looked at it It was a little piece of stiff
notepaper cut into the shape of a curved V rather after the fashion of
a soaring bird It must have been there for months He looked at it His
carewrinkled brow relaxed He glanced over his shoulder at the house
and then held this little scrap high over his head and let go It
descended with a slanting flight curving round to the left and then came
about and swept down to the ground to the right Now why did it go
like that As if it changed its mind He tried it again Same result
Suppose the curvature of the wings was a little greater Would it make a
more acute or a less acute angle He did not know Try it

He felt in his pocket for a piece of paper found Lady Laxtons letter
produced a stout pair of nail scissors in a sheath from a waistcoat
pocket selected a good clear sheet and set himself to cut out his
improved V

As he did so his eyes were on V number one on the ground It would be
interesting to see if this thing turned about to the left again If in
fact it would go on zigzagging It ought he felt to do so But to
test that one ought to release it from some higher point so as to give
it a longer flight Stand on the chair

Not in front of the whole rotten hotel And there was a beastly looking
man in a green apron coming out of the housethe sort of man who looks
at you He might come up and watch these fellows are equal to anything
of that sort Captain Douglas replaced his scissors and scraps in his
pockets leaned back with an affectation of boredom got up lit a
cigarettesort of thing the man in the green apron would think all
rightand strolled off towards a clump of beech trees beyond which were
bushes and a depression There perhaps one might be free from
observation Just try these things for a bit That point about the angle
was a curious one it made one feel ones ignorance not to know that


                                   

The ideal King has a careworn look he rules he has to do things but
the ideal Queen is radiant happiness tall and sweetly dignified simply
she has to be things And when at last towards midday Queen Madeleine
dispelled the clouds of the morning and came shining back into the world
that waited outside her door she was full of thankfulness for herself
and for the empire that was given her She knew she was a delicious and
wonderful thing she knew she was well done her hands the soft folds
of her dress as she held it up the sweep of her hair from her forehead
pleased her she lifted her chin but not too high for the almost
unenvious homage in the eyes of the housemaid on the staircase Her
descent was well timed for the lunch gathering of the hotel guests
there was Ahhere she comes at last and there was her own
particular court out upon the verandah before the entrance Geedge and
the Professor and Mrs Bowlesand Mrs Geedge coming across the
lawnand the lover

She came on down and out into the sunshine She betrayed no surprise
The others met her with flattering greetings that she returned
smilingly But the lover

He was not there

It was as if the curtain had gone up on almost empty stalls

He ought to have been worked up and waiting tremendously He ought to
have spent the morning in writing a poem to her or in writing a
delightful poetical love letter she could carry away and read or in
wandering alone and thinking about her He ought to be feeling now like
the end of a vigil He ought to be standing now a little in the
background and with that pleasant flush of his upon his face and that
shy subdued reluctant look that was so infinitely more flattering than
any boldness of admiration And then she would go towards him for she
was a giving type and hold out both hands to him and he as though he
couldnt help it in spite of all his British reserve would take one
and hesitatewhich made it all the more markedand kiss it

Instead of which he was just not there

No visible disappointment dashed her bravery She knew that at the
slightest flicker Judy and Mrs Geedge would guess and that anyhow the
men would guess nothing Ive rested she said Ive rested
delightfully What have you all been doing

Judy told of great conversations Mr Geedge had been looking for
trout in the stream Mrs Geedge with a thin little smile said she
had been making a few notes andshe added the word with
deliberationobservations and Professor Bowles said he had had a
round of golf with the Captain And he lost asked Madeleine

Hes careless in his drive and impatient at the greens said the
Professor modestly

And then

He vanished said the Professor recognizing the true orientation of
her interest

There was a little pause and Mrs Geedge said You know and stopped
short

Interrogative looks focussed upon her

Its so odd she said

Curiosity increased

I suppose one ought not to say said Mrs Geedge and yetwhy
shouldnt one

Exactly said Professor Bowles and every one drew a little nearer to
Mrs Geedge

One cant help being amused she said It was soextraordinary

Is it something about the Captain asked Madeleine

Yes You seehe didnt see me

Is heis he writing poetry Madeleine was much entertained and
relieved at the thought That would account for everything The poor
dear He hadnt been able to find some rhyme

But one gathered from the mysterious airs of Mrs Geedge that he was not
writing poetry You see she said I was lying out there among the
bushes just jotting down a few little thingsand he came by And he
went down into the hollow out of sight And what do you think he is
doing Youd never guess Hes been at it for twenty minutes

They didnt guess

Hes playing with little bits of paperOh like a kitten plays with
dead leaves He throws them upand they flutter to the groundand then
he pounces on them

But said Madeleine And then very brightly lets go and see

She was amazed She couldnt understand She hid it under a light
playfulness that threatened to become distraught Even when presently
after a very careful stalking of the dell under the guidance of Mrs
Geedge with the others in support she came in sight of him she still
found him incredible There was her lover her devoted lover standing
on the top bar of a fence his legs wide apart and his body balanced
with difficulty and in his fingers poised high was a little scrap of
paper This was the man who should have been waiting in the hall with
feverish anxiety His fingers released the little model and down it went
drifting

He seemed to be thinking of nothing else in the world She might never
have been born

Some noise some rustle caught his ear He turned his head quickly
guiltily and saw her and her companions

And then he crowned her astonishment No lovelight leapt to his eyes he
uttered no cry of joy Instead he clutched wildly at the air shouted
Oh damn and came down with a complicated inelegance on all fours
upon the ground

He was angry with herangry she could see that he was extremely angry


                                   

So it was that the incompatibilities of man and woman arose again in the
just recovering love dream of Madeleine Philips But now the discord was
far more evident than it had been at the first breach

Suddenly her dear lover her flatterer her worshipper had become a
strange averted man He scrabbled up two of his paper scraps before he
came towards her still with no lovelight in his eyes He kissed her
hand as if it was a matter of course and said almost immediately Ive
been hoping for you all the endless morning Ive had to amuse myself as
best I can His tone was resentful He spoke as if he had a claim upon
herupon her attentions As if it wasnt entirely upon his side that
obligations lay

She resolved that shouldnt deter her from being charming

And all through the lunch she was as charming as she could be and under
such treatment that rebellious ruffled quality vanished from his manner
vanished so completely that she could wonder if it had really been
evident at any time The alert servitor returned

She was only too pleased to forget the disappointment of her descent and
forgive him and it was with a puzzled incredulity that she presently
saw his difficult expression returning It was an odd little knitting
of the brows a faint absentmindedness a filming of the brightness of
his worship He was just perceptibly indifferent to the charmed and
charming things she was saying

It seemed best to her to open the question herself Is there something
on your mind Dot

Dot was his old school nickname

Well nonot exactly on my mind But Its a bother of course Theres
that confounded boy

Were you trying some sort of divination about him With those pieces of
paper

No That was different That wasjust something else But you see that
boy Probably clear up the whole of the Moggeridge botherand you know
it is a bother Might turn out beastly awkward

It was extraordinarily difficult to express He wanted so much to stay
with her and he wanted so much to go

But all reason all that was expressible all that found vent in words
and definite suggestions was on the side of an immediate pursuit of
Bealby So that it seemed to her he wanted and intended to go much more
definitely than he actually did

That divergence of purpose flawed a beautiful afternoon cast chill
shadows of silence over their talk arrested endearments She was
irritated About six oclock she urged him to go she did not mind
anyhow she had things to see to letters to write and she left him with
an effect of leaving him for ever He went and overhauled his motor
bicycle thoroughly and then an aching dread of separation from her
arrested him

Dinner the late June sunset and the moon seemed to bring them together
again Almost harmoniously he was able to suggest that he should get up
very early the next morning pursue and capture Bealby and return for
lunch

Youd get up at dawn she cried But how perfectly Splendid the
midsummer dawn must be

Then she had an inspiration Dot she cried I will get up at dawn
also and come with you Yes but as you say he cannot be more than
thirteen miles away wed catch him warm in his little bed somewhere And
the freshness The dewy freshness

And she laughed her beautiful laugh and said it would be Such Fun
entering as she supposed into his secret desires and making the most
perfect of reconciliations They were to have tea first which she would
prepare with the caravan lamp and kettle Mrs Geedge would hand it over
to her

She broke into song A Hunting we will goooh she sang A Hunting we
will go

But she could not conquer the churlish underside of the Captains nature
even by such efforts She threw a glamour of vigour and fun over the
adventure but some cold streak in his composition was insisting all the
time that as a boy hunt the attempt failed Various little delays in her
preparations prevented a start before halfpast seven he let that weigh
with him and when sometimes she clapped her hands and ranand she ran
like a deer and sometimes she sang he said something about going at an
even pace

At a quarter past one Mrs Geedge observed them returning They were
walking abreast and about six feet apart they bore themselves grimly
after the manner of those who have delivered ultimata and they
conversed no more

In the afternoon Madeleine kept her own room exhausted and Captain
Douglas sought opportunities of speaking to her in vain His face
expressed distress and perplexity with momentary lapses into wrathful
resolution and he evaded Judy and her leading questions and talked
about the weather with Geedge He declined a proposal of the Professors
to go round the links with especial reference to his neglected putting
You ought to you know said the Professor

About halfpast three and without any publication of his intention
Captain Douglas departed upon his motor bicycle

Madeleine did not reappear until dinnertime and then she was clad in
lace and gaiety that impressed the naturally very good observation of
Mrs Geedge as unreal


                                   

The Captain a confusion of motives that was as it were a mind returning
to chaos started He had seen tears in her eyes Just for one instant
but certainly they were tears Tears of vexation Or sorrow Which is
the worse thing for a lover to arouse grief or resentment But this
boy must be caught because if he was not caught a perpetually
developing story of imbecile practical joking upon eminent and
influential persons would eat like a cancer into the Captains career
And if his career was spoilt what sort of thing would he be as a lover
Not to mention that he might never get a chance then to try flying for
military purposes So anyhow anyhow this boy must be caught But
quickly for womens hearts are tender they will not stand exposure to
hardship There is a kind of unreasonableness natural to goddesses
Unhappily this was an expedition needing wariness deliberation and one
brought to it a feverish hurry to get back There must be selfcontrol
There must be patience Such occasions try the soldierly quality of a
man

It added nothing to the Captains selfcontrol that after he had
travelled ten miles he found he had forgotten his quite indispensable
map and had to return for it Then he was seized again with doubts
about his inductions and went over them again sitting by the
roadside There must be patience  He went on at a pace of
thirtyfive miles an hour to the inn he had marked upon his map as
Bealbys limit for the second evening It was a beastly little inn it
stewed tea for the Captain atrociously and it knew nothing of Bealby
In the adjacent cottages also they had never heard of Bealby Captain
Douglas revised his deductions for the third time and came to the
conclusion that he had not made a proper allowance for Wednesday
afternoon Then there was all Thursday and the longer lengthening
part of Friday He might have done thirty miles or more already And
he might have crossed this cornerinconspicuously

Suppose he hadnt after all come along this road

He had a momentary vision of Madeleine with eyes brightly tearful You
left me for a Wild Goose Chase he fancied her saying

One must stick to ones job A soldier more particularly must stick to
his job Consider Balaclava

He decided to go on along this road and try the incidental cottages that
his reasoning led him to suppose were the most likely places at which
Bealby would ask for food It was a business demanding patience and
politeness

So a number of cottagers for the greater part they were elderly women
past the fiercer rush and hurry of life grandmothers and ancient dames
or wives at leisure with their children away at the Council schools had
a caller that afternoon Cottages are such lonely places in the daytime
that even district visitors and canvassers are godsends and only tramps
ill received Captain Douglas ranked high in the scale of visitors
There was something about him his fairness a certain handsomeness his
quick colour his active speech which interested women at all times
and now an indefinable flow of romantic excitement conveyed itself to
his interlocutors He encountered the utmost civility everywhere doors
at first tentatively ajar opened wider at the sight of him and there was
a kindly disposition to enter into his troubles lengthily and
deliberately People listened attentively to his demands and before
they testified to Bealbys sustained absence from their perception they
would for the most part ask numerous questions in return They wanted to
hear the Captains story the reason for his research the relationship
between himself and the boy they wanted to feel something of the
sentiment of the thing After that was the season for negative facts
Perhaps when everything was stated they might be able to conjure up what
he wanted He was asked in to have tea twice for he looked not only
pink and dusty but dry and one old lady said that years ago she had
lost just such a boy as Bealby seemed to beAh not in the way you
have lost himand she wept poor old dear and was only comforted after
she had told the Captain three touching but extremely lengthy and
detailed anecdotes of Bealbys vanished prototype

Fellow cannot rush away you know still all this sort of thing
accumulating means a confounded lot of delay

And then there was a deaf old man A very very tiresome deaf old man
who said at first he had seen Bealby

After all the old fellow was deaf

The sunset found the Captain on a breezy common forty miles away from
the Redlake Royal Hotel and by this time he knew that fugitive boys
cannot be trusted to follow the lines even of the soundest inductions
This business meant a search

Should he pelt back to Redlake and start again more thoroughly on the
morrow

A moment of temptation

If he did he knew she wouldnt let him go

No

NO

He must make a sweeping movement through the country to the left trying
up and down the roads that roughly speaking radiated from Redlake
between the twentyfifth and the thirtyfifth milestone

It was night and high moonlight when at last the Captain reached
Crayminster that little old town decayed to a village in the Crays
valley He was hungry dispirited quite unsuccessful and here he
resolved to eat and rest for the night

He would have a meal for by this time he was ravenous and then go and
talk in the bar or the tap about Bealby

Until he had eaten he felt he could not endure the sound of his own
voice repeating what had already become a tiresome stereotyped formula
You havent I suppose seen or heard anything during the last two days
of a small boylittle chap of about thirteenwandering about Hes a
sturdy resolute little fellow with a high colour short wiry hair
rather dark

The White Hart at Crayminster after some negotiations produced mutton
cutlets and Australian hock As he sat at his meal in the small
ambiguous respectable diningroom of the innadorned with framed and
glazed beer advertisements crinkled paper fringes and insincere
sporting printshe became aware of a murmurous confabulation going on in
the bar parlour It must certainly he felt be the bar parlour

He could not hear distinctly and yet it seemed to him that the
conversational style of Crayminster was abnormally rich in expletive
And the tone was odd It had a steadfast quality of commination

He brushed off a crumb from his jacket lit a cigarette and stepped
across the passage to put his hopeless questions

The talk ceased abruptly at his appearance

It was one of those deeptoned bar parlours that are so infinitely more
pleasant to the eye than the tawdry decorations of the genteel
accommodation It was brown with a trimming of green paper hops and it
had a mirror and glass shelves sustaining bottles and tankards Six or
seven individuals were sitting about the room They had a numerous
effect There was a man in very light floury tweeds with a floury bloom
on his face and hair and an anxious depressed expression He was clearly
a baker He sat forward as though he nursed something precious under the
table Next him was a respectablelooking regularfeatured fair man
with a large head and a ruddyfaced butcherlike individual smoked a
clay pipe by the side of the fireplace A further individual with an
alert intrusive look might have been a grocers assistant associating
above himself

Evening said the Captain

Evening said the man with the large hand guardedly

The Captain came to the hearthrug with an affectation of ease

I suppose he began that you havent any of you seen anything of a
small boy wandering about Hes a little chap about thirteen Sturdy
resolutelooking little fellow with a high colour short wiry hair
rather dark

He stopped short arrested by the excited movements of the butchers
pipe and by the changed expressions of the rest of the company

Wewe seen im the man with the big head managed to say at last

We seen im all right said a voice out of the darkness beyond the
range of the lamp

The baker with the melancholy expression interjected I dont care if I
dont ever see im again

Ah said the Captain astonished to find himself suddenly beyond
hoping on a hot fresh scent Now all thats very interesting Where did
you see him

Thunderin vicious little varmint said the butcher Owdacious

Mr Benshaw said the voice from the shadows Es arter im now with
a shot gun loaded up wi oats Ell pepper im if e gets im Bill
will you bet your at And serve im jolly well right tew

I doubt said the baker I doubt if Ill ever get my stummiknot
thoroughly proper again Its a Blow Ive ad E give me a Blow Oh
Mr Orrocks could I trouble you for another thimbleful of brandy
Just a thimbleful neat It eases the ache




                               CHAPTER VI
                          BEALBY AND THE TRAMP


                                   

Bealby was loth to leave the caravan party even when by his own gross
negligence it had ceased to be a caravan party He made off regretfully
along the crest of the hills through bushes of yew and box until the
clamour of the disaster was no longer in his ears Then he halted for a
time and stood sorrowing and listening and then turned up by a fence
along the border of a plantation and so came into a little overhung
road

His ideas of his immediate future were vague in the extreme He was a
receptive expectation Since his departure from the gardeners cottage
circumstances had handed him on They had been interesting but unstable
circumstances He supposed they would still hand him on So far as he
had any definite view about his intentions it was that he was running
away to sea And that he was getting hungry

It was also he presently discovered getting dark very gently and
steadily And the overhung road after some tortuosities expired suddenly
upon the bosom of a great grey empty common with distant mysterious
hedges

It seemed high time to Bealby that something happened of a comforting
nature

Always hitherto something or someone had come to his help when the world
grew dark and cold and given him supper and put him or sent him to bed
Even when he had passed a night in the interstices of Shonts he had
known there was a bed at quite a little distance under the stairs If
only that loud Voice hadnt shouted curses whenever he moved he would
have gone to it But as he went across this common in the gloaming it
became apparent that this amiable routine was to be broken For the
first time he realized the world could be a homeless world

And it had become very still

Disagreeably still and full of ambiguous shadows

That common was not only an unsheltered place he felt but an
unfriendly place and he hurried to a gate at the further end He kept
glancing to the right and to the left It would be pleasanter when he
had got through that gate and shut it after him

In England there are no grey wolves

Yet at times one thinks of wolves grey wolves the colour of twilight
and running noiselessly almost noiselessly at the side of their prey
for quite a long time before they close in on it

In England I say there are no grey wolves

Wolves were extinguished in the reign of Edward the Third it was in the
histories and since then no free wolf has trod the soil of England
only menagerie captives

Of course there may be escaped wolves

Now the gatesharp through it and slam it behind you and a little
brisk run and so into this plantation that slopes down hill This is a
sort of path vague but it must be a path Let us hope it is a path

What was that among the trees

It stopped surely it stopped as Bealby stopped Pump pump Of
course that was ones heart

Nothing there Just fancy Wolves live in the open they do not come
into woods like this And besides there are no wolves And if one
shoutseven if it is but a phantom voice one produces they go away
They are cowardly thingsreally Such as there arent

And there is the power of the human eye

Which is why they stalk you and watch you and evade you when you look
and creep and creep and creep behind you

Turn sharply

Nothing

How this stuff rustled under the feet In woods at twilight with
innumerable things darting from trees and eyes watching you everywhere
it would be pleasanter if one could walk without making quite such a
row Presently surely Bealby told himself he would come out on a high
road and meet other people and say goodnight as they passed Jolly
other people they would be answering Goodnight He was now going at
a moistening trot It was getting darker and he stumbled against things

When you tumble down wolves leap Not of course that there are any
wolves

It was stupid to keep thinking of wolves in this way Think of something
else Think of things beginning with a B Beautiful things boys beads
butterflies bears The mind stuck at bears Are there such things as
long grey bears Ugh Almost endless noiseless bears

It grew darker until at last the trees were black The night was
swallowing up the flying Bealby and he had a preposterous persuasion
that it had teeth and would begin at the back of his legs


                                   

Hi cried Bealby weakly hailing the glow of the fire out of the
darkness of the woods above

The man by the fire peered at the sound he had been listening to the
stumbling footsteps for some time and he answered nothing

In another minute Bealby had struggled through the hedge into the
visible world and stood regarding the man by the fire The phantom
wolves had fled beyond Sirius But Bealbys face was pale still from the
terrors of the pursuit and altogether he looked a smallish sort of small
boy

Lost said the man by the fire

Couldnt find my way said Bealby

Anyone with you

No

The man reflected Tired

Bit

Come and sit down by the fire and rest yourself

I wont urt you he added as Bealby hesitated

So far in his limited experience Bealby had never seen a human
countenance lit from behind by a flickering red flame The effect he
found remarkable rather than pleasing It gave this stranger the most
active and unstable countenance Bealby had ever seen The nose seemed to
be in active oscillation between pug and Roman the eyes jumped out of
black caves and then went back into them the more permanent features
appeared to be a vast triangle of neck and chin The tramp would have
impressed Bealby as altogether inhuman if it had not been for the smell
of cooking he diffused There were onions in it and turnips and
peppermouthwatering constituents testimonials to virtue He was
making a stew in an old can that he had slung on a cross stick over a
brisk fire of twigs that he was constantly replenishing

I wont urt you darn you he repeated Come and sit down on these
leaves here for a bit and tell me all abart it

Bealby did as he was desired I got lost he said feeling too
exhausted to tell a good story

The tramp examined more closely became less pyrotechnic He had a
large loose mouth a confused massive nose much long fair hair a broad
chin with a promising beard and spotsa lot of spots His eyes looked
out of deep sockets and they were sharp little eyes He was a lean man
His hands were large and long and they kept on with the feeding of the
fire as he sat and talked to Bealby Once or twice he leant forward and
smelt the pot judiciously but all the time the little eyes watched
Bealby very closely

Lose yer collar said the tramp

Bealby felt for his collar I took it orf he said

Come far

Over there said Bealby

Where

Over there

What place

Dont know the name of it

Then it aint your ome

No

Youve run away said the man

Praps I ave said Bealby

Praps you ave Why praps You ave Whats the good of telling
lies abart it Whend you start

Monday said Bealby

The tramp reflected Had abart enough of it

Dunno said Bealby truthfully

Like some soup

Yes

Ow much

I could do with a lot said Bealby

Ah yah I didnt mean that I meant ow much for some Ow much will
you pay for a nice nice arf can of soup I aint a darn charity See

Tuppence said Bealby

The tramp shook his head slowly from side to side and took out the
battered iron spoon he was using to stir the stuff and tasted the soup
lusciously It wasjolly good soup and there were potatoes in it

Thrippence said Bealby

Ow much you got asked the tramp

Bealby hesitated perceptibly Sixpence he said weakly

Its sixpence said the tramp Pay up

Ow big a can asked Bealby

The tramp felt about in the darkness behind him and produced an empty
can with a jagged mouth that had once contained the label witnessedI
quote I do not justifyDeep Sea Salmon That he said and this
chunk of bread Right enough

You will do it said Bealby

Do I look a swindle cried the tramp and suddenly a lump of the
abundant hair fell over one eye in a singularly threatening manner
Bealby handed over the sixpence without further discussion Ill treat
you fairly you see said the tramp after he had spat on and pocketed
the sixpence and he did as much He decided that the soup was ready to
be served and he served it with care Bealby began at once Theres a
nextry onion said the tramp throwing one over It didnt cost me
much and I gives it you for nothin Thats all right eh Heres
ealth

Bealby consumed his soup and bread meekly with one eye upon his host He
would he decided eat all he could and then sit a little while and
then get this tramp to tell him the way toanywhere else And the tramp
wiped soup out of his can with gobbets of bread very earnestly and
meditated sagely on Bealby

You better pal in with me matey for a bit he said at last You
cant go nowhere elsenot tonight

Couldnt I walk perhaps to a town or sumpthing

These woods aint safe

Ow dyou mean

Ever eard tell of a gurrilliasort of big black monkey thing

Yes said Bealby faintly

Theres been one loose abart ereoh week or more Fact And if you
wasnt a grown up man quite and going along in the dark welle might
say something to you Of course e wouldnt do nothing where there
was a fire or a manbut a little chap like you I wouldnt like to let
you do it strewth I wouldnt Its risky Course I dont want to
keep you There it is You go if you like But Id rather you didnt
Onest

Whered he come from asked Bealby

Mnagery said the tramp

E very near bit through the fist of a chap that tried to stop im
said the tramp

Bealby after weighing tramp and gorilla very carefully in his mind
decided he wouldnt and drew closer to the firebut not too closeand
the conversation deepened


                                   

It was a long and rambling conversation and the tramp displayed himself
at times as quite an amiable person It was a discourse varied by
interrogations and as a thread of departure and return it dealt with
the life of the road and with life at large andlife and with matters
of must and may

Sometimes and more particularly at first Bealby felt as though a
ferocious beast lurked in the tramp and peeped out through the fallen
hank of hair and might leap out upon him and sometimes he felt the
tramp was large and fine and gay and amusing more particularly when he
lifted his voice and his bristling chin And ever and again the talker
became a nasty creature and a disgusting creature and his redlit face
was an ugly creeping approach that made Bealby recoil And then again he
was strong and wise So the unstable needle of a boys moral compass
spins

The tramp used strange terms He spoke of the deputy and the
dosshouse of the spike and padding the hoof of screevers and
tarts and coppers narks To these words Bealby attached such
meanings as he could and so the things of which the tramp talked
floated unsurely into his mind and again and again he had to readjust
and revise his interpretations And through these dim and fluctuating
veils a new side of life dawned upon his consciousness a side that was
strange and lawless and dirtyin every way dirtyand dreadful
andattractive That was the queer thing about it that attraction It
had humour For all its squalor and repulsiveness it was lit by defiance
and laughter bitter laughter perhaps but laughter It had a gaiety
that Mr Mergleson for example did not possess it had a penetration
like the penetrating quality of onions or acids or asaftida that made
the memory of Mr Darling insipid

The tramp assumed from the outset that Bealby had done something and
run away and some mysterious etiquette prevented his asking directly
what was the nature of his offence But he made a number of insidious
soundings And he assumed that Bealby was taking to the life of the road
and that until good cause to the contrary appeared they were to remain
together Its a tough life he said but it has its points and you
got a toughish look about you

He talked of roads and the quality of roads and countryside This was a
good countryside it wasnt overdone and there was no great hostility to
wanderers and sleeping out Some roadsthe London to Brighton for
example if a chap struck a match somebody came running But here
unless you went pulling the haystacks about too much they left you
alone And they werent such dead nuts on their pheasants and one had a
chance of an empty cowshed If Ive spotted a shed or anything with a
roof to it I stay out said the tramp even if its raining cats and
dogs Otherwise its the dossouse or the spike Its the rain is the
worst thinggetting wet You havent been wet yet not if you only
started Monday Wetwith a chilly wind to drive it Gaw I been blown
out of a holly hedge You would think thered be protection in a holly
hedge

Spikes the last thing said the tramp Id rather go baregutted to
a dossouse anywhen Gawyouve not ad your first taste of the spike
yet

But it wasnt heaven in the dosshouses He spoke of several of the
landladies in strange but it would seem unflattering terms And theres
always such a blamed lot of washing going on in a dossouse Always
washing they are One chaps washing is socks and anothers washing is
shirt Making a steam drying it Disgustin Carnt see what they want
with it all Barnd to git dirty again

He discoursed of spikes that is to say of workhouses and of masters
And then he said with revolting yet alluring adjectives theres
the bath

Thats the worst side of it said the tramp Owever it doesnt
always rain and if it doesnt rain well you can keep yourself dry

He came back to the pleasanter aspects of the nomadic life He was all
for the outdoor style Aint we comfortable ere he asked He
sketched out the simple larcenies that had contributed and given zest to
the evenings meal But it seemed there were also dosshouses that had
the agreeable side Never been in one he said But where you been
sleeping since Monday

Bealby described the caravan in phrases that seemed suddenly thin and
anmic to his ears

You hit it lucky said the tramp If a chaps a kid he strikes all
sorts of luck of that sort Now ef I come up against three ladies
travellin in a vanthink theyd arst me in Not it

He dwelt with manifest envy on the situation and the possibilities of
the situation for some time You aint dangerous he said thats
where you get in

He consoled himself by anecdotes of remarkable good fortunes of a
kindred description Apparently he sometimes travelled in the company of
a lady named Izzy Bernersa fair scorcher been a regular slapup
circus actress And there was also good old Susan It was a little
difficult for Bealby to see the point of some of these flashes by a
tendency on the part of the tramp while his thoughts turned on these
matters to adopt a staccato style of speech punctuated by brief darkly
significant guffaws There grew in the mind of Bealby a vision of the
dosshouse as a large crowded place lit by a great central fire with
much cooking afoot and much jawing and disputing going on and then me
and Izzy sailed in

The fire sank the darkness of the woods seemed to creep nearer The
moonlight pierced the trees only in long beams that seemed to point
steadfastly at unseen things it made patches of ashen light that looked
like watching faces Under the tramps direction Bealby skirmished round
and got sticks and fed the fire until the darkness and thoughts of a
possible gorilla were driven back for some yards and the tramp
pronounced the blaze a fair treat He had made a kind of bed of leaves
which he now invited Bealby to extend and share and lying feet to the
fire he continued his discourse

He talked of stealing and cheating by various endearing names he made
these enterprises seem adventurous and facetious there was it seemed a
peculiar sort of happy find one came upon called a flat that it was
not only entertaining but obligatory to swindle He made fraud seem so
smart and bright at times that Bealby found it difficult to keep a firm
grasp on the fact that it wasfraud

Bealby lay upon the leaves close up to the prone body of the tramp and
his mind and his standards became confused The tramps body was a dark
but protecting ridge on one side of him he could not see the fire
beyond his toes but its flickerings were reflected by the tree stems
about them and made perplexing sudden movements that at times caught
his attention and made him raise his head to watch them Against the
terrors of the night the tramp had become humanity the species the
moral basis His voice was full of consolation his topics made one
forget the watchful silent circumambient Bealbys first distrusts
faded He began to think the tramp a fine brotherly generous fellow
He was also growing accustomed to a faint somethingshall I call it an
olfactory barthat had hitherto kept them apart The monologue ceased to
devote itself to the elucidation of Bealby the tramp was lying on his
back with his fingers interlaced beneath his head and talking not so
much to his companion as to the stars and the universe at large His
theme was no longer the wandering life simply but the wandering life as
he had led it and the spiritedness with which he had led it and the
real and admirable quality of himself It was that soliloquy of
consolation which is the secret preservative of innumerable lives

He wanted to make it perfectly clear that he was a tramp by choice He
also wanted to make it clear that he was a tramp and no better because
of the wicked folly of those he had trusted and the evil devices of
enemies In the world that contained those figures of spirit Isopel
Berners and Susan there was also it seemed a bad and spiritless person
the tramps wife who had done him many passive injuries It was clear
she did not appreciate her blessings She had been much to blame
Anybodys opinion is better than er usbands said the tramp
Always as been Bealby had a sudden memory of Mr Darling saying
exactly the same thing of his mother Shes the sort said the tramp
what would rather go to a meetin than a music all Shed rather drop
a shilling down a crack than spend it on anything decent If there was a
choice of jobs going shed ask which ad the lowest pay and the longest
hours and shed choose that Shed feel safer She was born scared
When there wasnt anything else to do shed stop at ome and scrub the
floors Gaw it made a chap want to put the darn pail over er ed
sos shed get enough of it

I dont hold with all this crawling through life and saying Please
said the tramp I say its my world just as much as its your
world You may have your orses and carriages your ouses and country
places and all that and you may think Gawd sent me to run abart and work
for you but I dont See

Bealby saw

I seek my satisfactions just as you seek your satisfactions and if you
want to get me to work youve jolly well got to make me I dont choose
to work I choose to keep on my own and a bit loose and take my chance
where I find it You got to take your chances in this world Sometimes
they come bad and sometimes they come good And very often you cant
tell which it is when they ave come

Then he fell questioning Bealby again and then he talked of the
immediate future He was beating for the seaside Always something
doing he said You got to keep your eye on for cops those seaside
benches theyre ot on trampsgive you a month for begging soon as look
at youbut theres flats dropping sixpences thick as flies on a sore
orse You want a there for all sorts of jobs Youre just the chap for
it matey Saw it soons ever I set eyes on you

He made projects

Finally he became more personal and very flattering

Now you and me he said suddenly shifting himself quite close to
Bealby were going to be downright pals Ive took a liking to you Me
and you are going to pal together See

He breathed into Bealbys face and laid a hand on his knee and squeezed
it and Bealby on the whole felt honoured by his protection


                                   

In the unsympathetic light of a bright and pushful morning the tramp was
shorn of much of his overnight glamour It became manifest that he was
not merely offensively unshaven but extravagantly dirty It was not
ordinary rural dirt During the last few days he must have had dealings
of an intimate nature with coal He was taciturn and irritable he
declared that this sleeping out would be the death of him and the
breakfast was only too manifestly wanting in the comforts of a refined
home He seemed a little less embittered after breakfast he became even
faintly genial but he remained unpleasing A distaste for the tramp
arose in Bealbys mind and as he walked on behind his guide and friend
he revolved schemes of unobtrusive detachment

Far be it from me to accuse Bealby of ingratitude But it is true that
that same disinclination which made him a disloyal assistant to Mr
Mergleson was now affecting his comradeship with the tramp And he was
deceitful He allowed the tramp to build projects in the confidence of
his continued adhesion he did not warn him of the defection he
meditated But on the other hand Bealby had acquired from his mother an
effective horror of stealing And one must admit since the tramp
admitted it that the man stole

And another little matter had at the same time estranged Bealby from the
tramp and linked the two of them together The attentive reader will
know that Bealby had exactly two shillings and twopencehalfpenny when
he came down out of the woods to the fireside He had Mrs Bowles
halfcrown and the balance of Madeleine Philips theatre shilling minus
sixpence halfpenny for a collar and sixpence he had given the tramp for
the soup overnight But all this balance was now in the pocket of the
tramp Money talks and the tramp had heard it He had not taken it away
from Bealby but he had obtained it in this manner We two are pals
he said and one of us had better be Treasurer Thats Me I know the
ropes better So hand over what you got there matey

And after he had pointed out that a refusal might lead to Bealbys
evisceration the transfer occurred Bealby was searched kindly but
firmly

It seemed to the tramp that this trouble had now blown over completely

Little did he suspect the rebellious and treacherous thoughts that
seethed in the head of his companion Little did he suppose that his
personal appearance his manners his ethical flavournay even his
physical flavourwere being judged in a spirit entirely unamiable It
seemed to him that he had obtained youthful and subservient
companionship companionship that would be equally agreeable and useful
he had adopted a course that he imagined would cement the ties between
them he reckoned not with ingratitude If anyone arsts you who I am
call me uncle he said He walked along a little in advance sticking
his toes out right and left in a peculiar wide pace that characterized
his walk and revolving schemes for the happiness and profit of the day
To begin withgreat draughts of beer Then tobacco Later perhaps a
little bread and cheese for Bealby You cant come in ere he said at
the first public house Youre under age me boy It aint my doing
matey its Erbert Samuel You blame im E dont objec to you going
to work for any other Mr Samuel there may appen to be abart or
anything of that sort thats good for you that is but es most
particular you shouldnt go into a public ouse So you just wait abart
outside ere Ill ave my eye on you

You going to spend my money asked Bealby

Im going to ration the party said the tramp

Youyou got no right to spend my money said Bealby

IAng itIll get you some acid drops said the tramp in tones of
remonstrance I tell you blame youits Erbert Samuel I cant elp
it I cant fight against the lor

You havent any right to spend my money said Bealby

Downt cut up crusty Ow can I elp it

Ill tell a policeman You gimme back my money and lemme go

The tramp considered the social atmosphere It did not contain a
policeman It contained nothing but a peaceful kindly corner public
house a sleeping dog and the back of an elderly man digging

The tramp approached Bealby in a confidential manner Oos going to
believe you he said And besides ow did you come by it

Moreover I aint going to spend your money I got money of my own
Ere See And suddenly before the dazzled eyes of Bealby he held and
instantly withdrew three shillings and two coppers that seemed familiar
He had had a shilling of his own

Bealby waited outside

The tramp emerged in a highly genial mood with acid drops and a short
clay pipe going strong Ere he said to Bealby with just the faintest
flavour of magnificence over the teethheld pipe and handed over not
only the acid drops but a virgin short clay Fill he said proffering
the tobacco Its yours jus much as its mine Ber not let Erbert
Samuel see you though thats all Es got a lor abart it

Bealby held his pipe in his clenched hand He had already smokedonce
He remembered it quite vividly still although it had happened six
months ago Yet he hated not using that tobacco No he said Ill
smoke later

The tramp replaced the screw of red Virginia in his pocket with the air
of one who has done the gentlemanly thing

They went on their way an illassorted couple

All day Bealby chafed at the tie and saw the security in the tramps
pocket vanish They lunched on bread and cheese and then the tramp had a
good sustaining drink of beer for both of them and after that they came
to a common where it seemed agreeable to repose And after a due meed of
repose in a secluded hollow among the gorse the tramp produced a pack of
exceedingly greasy cards and taught Bealby to play Euchre Apparently
the tramp had no distinctive pockets in his tail coat the whole lining
was one capacious pocket Various knobs and bulges indicated his cooking
tin his feeding tin a turnip and other unknown properties At first
they played for love and then they played for the balance in the tramps
pocket And by the time Bealby had learnt Euchre thoroughly that
balance belonged to the tramp But he was very generous about it and
said they would go on sharing just as they had done And then he became
confidential He scratched about in the bagginess of his garment and
drew out a little dark blade of stuff like a flint implement regarded
it gravely for a moment and held it out to Bealby Guess what this is

Bealby gave it up

Smell it

It smelt very nasty One familiar smell indeed there was with a
paradoxical sanitary quality that he did not quite identify but that
was a mere basis for a complex reek of acquisitions What is it said
Bealby

Soap

But whats it for

I thought youd arst that Whats soap usually for

Washing said Bealby guessing wildly

The tramp shook his head Making a foam he corrected Thats what I
has my fits with See I shoves a bit in my mouth and down I goes and I
rolls about Making a sort of moaning sound Why I been given brandy
oftenneat brandy It isnt always a certnothings absolutely a
cert Ive ad some letdowns Once I was bit by a nasty little
dogthat brought me to pretty quickand once I ad an old gentleman go
through my pockets Poor chap e ses very likely es destitoot
lets see if es got anything Id got all sorts of things I
didnt want im prying about But I didnt cometo sharp enough to
stop im Got me into trouble that did

Its an old lay said the tramp but its astonishing ow itll go in
a quiet village Sort of amuses em Or dropping suddenly in front of a
bicycle party Lot of them old tricks are the best tricks and there
aint many of em Billy Bridget dont know Thats where youre lucky to
ave met me matey Billy Bridgets a ard man to starve And I know the
ropes I know what you can do and what you cant do And I got a
feeling for a policemansame as some people ave for cats Id know if
one was idden in the room

He expanded into anecdotes and the story of various encounters in which
he shone It was amusing and it took Bealby on his weak side Wasnt he
the Champion Dodger of the Chelsome playground

The tide of talk ebbed Well said the tramp time we was up and
doing

They went along shady lanes and across an open park and they skirted a
breezy common from which they could see the sea And among other things
that the tramp said was this Time we began to forage a bit

He turned his large observant nose to the right of him and the left


                                   

Throughout the afternoon the tramp discoursed upon the rights and wrongs
of property in a way that Bealby found very novel and unsettling The
tramp seemed to have his ideas about owning and stealing arranged quite
differently from those of Bealby Never before had Bealby thought it
possible to have them arranged in any other than the way he knew But
the tramp contrived to make most possession seem unrighteous and honesty
a code devised by those who have for those who havent Theyve just
got old of it he said They want to keep it to themselves Do I
look as though Id stole much of anybodys It isnt me got old of this
land and sticking up my notice boards to keep everybody off It isnt me
spends my days and nights scheming ow I can get old of more and more
of the stuff

I dont envy it em said the tramp Some as one taste and some
another But when it comes to making all this fuss because a chap who
isnt a schemer elps imself to a mthfulwell its Rot

Its them makes the rules of the game and nobody ever arst me to play
it I dont blame em mind you Me and you might very well do the same
But brast me if I see where the sense of my keeping the rules comes
in This world ought to be a share out Gawd meant it to be a share out
And me and youwe been done out of our share That justifies us

It isnt right to steal said Bealby

It isnt right to stealcertainly It isnt rightbut its universal
Heres a chap here over this fence ask im where e got is land
Stealing What you call stealing matey I call restitootion You
aint probably never even eard of socialism

Ive eard of socialists right enough Dont believe in Gawd and
avent no morality

Dont you believe it WhyArf the socialists are parsons What Im
saying is socialismpractically Im a socialist I know all abart
socialism There isnt nothing you can tell me abart socialism Whyfor
three weeks I was one of these here AntiSocialist speakers Paid for
it And I tell you there aint such a thing as property left its all a
blooming old pinch Lords commons judges all of them theyre just a
crew of brasted old fences and the lawyers getting in the stuff Then
you talk to me of stealing Stealing

The tramps contempt and his intense way of saying stealing were very
unsettling to a sensitive mind

They bought some tea and grease in a village shop and the tramp made tea
in his old tin with great dexterity and then they gnawed bread on which
two ounces of margarine had been generously distributed Live like
fighting cocks we do said the tramp wiping out his simple cuisine
with the draggedout end of his shirt sleeve And if Im not very much
mistaken well sleep tonight on a nice bit of hay

But these anticipations were upset by a sudden temptation and instead
of a starry summer comfort the two were destined to spend a night of
suffering and remorse

A green lane lured them off the road and after some windings led them
past a field of wirenetted enclosures containing a number of perfect
and conceitedlooking hens close beside a little cottage a vegetable
garden and some new elaborate outhouses It was manifestly a poultry
farm and something about it gave the tramp the conviction that it had
been left that nobody was at home

These realizations are instinctive they leap to the mind He knew it
and an ambition to know further what was in the cottage came with the
knowledge But it seemed to him desirable that the work of exploration
should be done by Bealby He had thought of dogs and it seemed to him
that Bealby might be unembarrassed by that idea So he put the thing to
Bealby Lets have a look round ere he said You go in and see
whats abart

There was some difference of opinion I dont ask you to take
anything said the tramp Nobody wont catch you I tell you
nobody wont catch you I tell you there aint nobody here to catch
you Just for the fun of seeing in Ill go up by them outhouses And
Ill see nobody comes Aint afraid to go up a garden path are
you I tell you I dont want you to steal You aint got much
guts to funk a thing like that Ill be abt too Thought youd be
the very chap for a bit of scarting Thought Boy Scarts was all the
go nowadays Well if you aint afraid youd do it Well why
didnt you say youd do it at the beginning

Bealby went through the hedge and up a grass track between poultry runs
made a cautious inspection of the outhouses and then approached the
cottage Everything was still He thought it more plausible to go to the
door than peep into the window He rapped Then after an interval of
stillness he lifted the latch opened the door and peered into the room
It was a pleasantly furnished room and before the empty summer
fireplace a very old white man was sitting in a chintzcovered
armchair lost it would seem in painful thought He had a peculiar grey
shrunken look his eyes were closed a bony hand with the shiny texture
of alabaster gripped the chair arm There was something about him
that held Bealby quite still for a moment

And this old gentleman behaved very oddly

His body seemed to crumple into his chair his hands slipped down from
the arms his head nodded forwards and his mouth and eyes seemed to open
together And he made a snoring sound

For a moment Bealby remained rigidly agape and then a violent desire to
rejoin the tramp carried him back through the hen runs

He tried to describe what he had seen

Asleep with his mouth open said the tramp Well that aint anything
so wonderful You got anything Thats what I want to know Did
anyone ever see such a boy Ere Ill go

You keep a look out here said the tramp

But there was something about that old man in there something so
strange and alien to Bealby that he could not remain alone in the
falling twilight He followed the cautious advances of the tramp towards
the house From the corner by the outhouses he saw the tramp go and peer
in at the open door He remained for some time peering his head hidden
from Bealby

Then he went in

Bealby had an extraordinary desire that somebody else would come His
soul cried out for help against some vaguely apprehended terror And in
the very moment of his wish came its fulfilment He saw advancing up the
garden path a tall woman in a blue serge dress hatless and hurrying and
carrying a little packageit was medicinein her hand And with her came
a big black dog At the sight of Bealby the dog came forward barking and
Bealby after a moments hesitation turned and fled

The dog was quick But Bealby was quicker He went up the netting of a
hen run and gave the dog no more than an ineffectual snap at his heels
And then dashing from the cottage door came the tramp Under one arm was
a brassbound workbox and in the other was a candlestick and some
smaller articles He did not instantly grasp the situation of his treed
companion he was too anxious to escape the tall woman and then with a
yelp of dismay he discovered himself between woman and dog All too late
he sought to emulate Bealby The workbox slipped from under his arm the
rest of his plunder fell from him for an uneasy moment he was clinging
to the side of the swaying hen run and then it had caved in and the dog
had got him

The dog bit desisted and then finding itself confronted by two men
retreated Bealby and the tramp rolled and scrambled over the other side
of the collapsed netting into a parallel track and were halfway to the
hedge before the dogbut this time in a less vehement fashionresumed
his attack

He did not close with them again and at the hedge he halted altogether
and remained hacking the gloaming with his rage

The woman it seemed had gone into the house leaving the tramps
scattered loot upon the field of battle

This means mizzle said the tramp leading the way at a trot

Bealby saw no other course but to follow

He had a feeling as though the world had turned against him He did not
dare to think what he was nevertheless thinking of the events of these
crowded ten minutes He felt he had touched something dreadful that the
twilight was full of accusations He feared and hated the tramp now
but he perceived something had linked them as they had not been linked
before Whatever it was they shared it


                                   

They fled through the night it seemed to Bealby for interminable hours
At last when they were worn out and footsore they crept through a gate
and found an uncomfortable cowering place in the corner of a field

As they went they talked but little but the tramp kept up a constant
muttering to himself He was troubled by the thought of hydrophobia

I know Ill ave it he said I know Ill get it

Bealby after a time ceased to listen to his companion His mind was
preoccupied He could think of nothing but that very white man in the
chair and the strange manner of his movement

Was e awake when you saw im he asked at last

Awakewho

That old man

For a moment or so the tramp said nothing E wasnt awake you young
silly he said at last

Butwasnt he

Whydont you know Ed croakedpopped off the ooksvery moment you
saw im

For a moment Bealbys voice failed him

Then he said quite faintly You meanhed  Was dead

Didnt you know said the tramp Gaw What a kid you are

In that manner it was Bealby first saw a dead man Never before had he
seen anyone dead And after that for all the night the old white man
pursued him with strange slowlyopening eyes and a head on one side
and his mouth suddenly and absurdly agape

All night long that white figure presided over seas of dark dismay It
seemed always to be there and yet Bealby thought of a score of other
painful things For the first time in his life he asked himself Where
am I going What am I drifting to The world beneath the old mans
dominance was a world of prisons

Bealby believed he was a burglar and behind the darkness he imagined the
outraged law already seeking him And the terrors of his associate
reinforced his own

He tried to think what he should do in the morning He dreaded the dawn
profoundly But he could not collect his thoughts because of the tramps
incessant lapses into grumbling lamentation Bealby knew he had to get
away from the tramp but now he was too weary and alarmed to think of
running away as a possible expedient And besides there was the matter
of his money And beyond the range of the tramps voice there were
darknesses which tonight at least might hold inconceivable forms of
lurking evil But could he not appeal to the law to save him Repent
Was there not something called turning Kings Evidence

The moon was no comfort that night Across it there passed with
incredible slowness a number of jagged little black clouds blacker than
any clouds Bealby had ever seen before They were like velvet palls
lined with snowy fur There was no end to them And one at last most
horribly gaped slowly and opened a mouth


                                   

At intervals there would be uncomfortable movements and the voice of the
tramp came out of the darkness beside Bealby lamenting his approaching
fate and discoursingsometimes with violent expressionson watchdogs

I know I shall ave idrophobia said the tramp Ive always ad a
disposition to idrophobia Always a dread of waterand now its got me

Think of itkeeping a beast to set at a uman being Wheres the
brotherhood of it Wheres the law and the humanity Getting a animal to
set at a brother man And a poisoned animal a animal with death in his
teeth And a orrible death too Wheres the sense and brotherhood

Gaw when I felt is teeth coming through my trsers

Dogs oughtnt to be allowed Theyre a noosance in the towns and a
danger in the country They oughtnt to be allowed anywherenot till
every blessed uman being as got three square meals a day Then if you
like keep a dog And see es a clean dog

Gaw if Id been a bit quicker up that en roost

I ought to ave landed im a kick

Its a mans duty to urt a dog When e sees a dog e ought to urt
im Its a natural atred If dogs were what they ought to be if dogs
understood ow theyre situated there wouldnt be a dog go for a man
ever

And if one did theyd shoot im

After this if ever I get a chance to land a dog a oner with a stone
Ill land im one I been too sorft with dogs

Towards dawn Bealby slept uneasily to be awakened by the loud snorting
curiosity of three lively young horses He sat up in a blinding sunshine
and saw the tramp looking very filthy and contorted sleeping with his
mouth wide open and an expression of dismay and despair on his face


                                   

Bealby took his chance to steal away next morning while the tramp was
engaged in artificial epilepsy

I feel like fits this morning said the tramp I could do it well I
want a bit of human kindness again After that brasted dog

I expect soon Ill ave the foam all right withat any soap

They marked down a little cottage before which a benevolentlooking
spectacled old gentleman in a large straw hat and a thin alpaca jacket
was engaged in budding roses Then they retired to prepare The tramp
handed over to Bealby various compromising possessions which might
embarrass an afflicted person under the searching hands of charity
There was for example the piece of soap after he had taken sufficient
for his immediate needs there was ninepence in money there were the
pack of cards with which they had played Euchre a key or so and some
wires much assorted string three tins a large piece of bread the end
of a composite candle a box of sulphur matches list slippers a pair
of gloves a clasp knife sundry grey rags They all seemed to have the
distinctive flavour of the tramp

If you do a bunk with these said the tramp By Gawd

He drew his finger across his throat

Kings Evidence

Bealby from a safe distance watched the beginnings of the fit and it
impressed him as a thoroughly nasty kind of fit He saw the elderly
gentleman hurry out of the cottage and stand for a moment looking over
his little green garden gate surveying the sufferings of the tramp with
an expression of intense yet discreet commiseration Then suddenly he
was struck by an idea he darted in among his rose bushes and reappeared
with a big wateringcan and an enormous syringe Still keeping the gate
between himself and the sufferer he loaded his syringe very carefully
and deliberately

Bealby would have liked to have seen more but he felt his moment had
come Another instant and it might be gone again Very softly he dropped
from the gate on which he was sitting and made off like a running
partridge along the hedge of the field

Just for a moment did he haltat a strange sharp yelp that came from the
direction of the little cottage Then his purpose of flight resumed its
control of him

He would strike across country for two or three miles then make for the
nearest police station and give himself up Loud voices Was that the
tramp murdering the benevolent old gentleman in the straw hat or was it
the benevolent old gentleman in the straw hat murdering the tramp No
time to question Onward Onward The tramps cans rattled in his
pocket He drew one out hesitated a moment and flung it away and then
sent its two companions after it

He found his police station upon the road between Someport and
Crayminster a little peaceful rural station a mere sunny cottage with
a blue and white label and a notice board covered with belated bills
about the stealing of pheasants eggs And another bill

It was headed MISSING and the next most conspicuous words were  REWARD
and the next ARTHUR BEALBY

He was fascinated So swift so terribly swift is the law Already they
knew of his burglary of his callous participation in the robbing of a
dead man Already the sleuths were upon his trail So surely did his
conscience strike to this conclusion that even the carelessly worded
offer of a reward that followed his description conveyed no different
intimation to his mind To whomsoever will bring him back to Lady
Laxton at Shonts near Chelsmore so it ran

And out of pocket expenses

And even as Bealby read this terrible document the door of the police
station opened and a very big pink young policeman came out and stood
regarding the world in a friendly selfapproving manner He had
innocent happy blue eyes thus far he had had much to do with order
and little with crime and his rosebud mouth would have fallen open had
not discipline already closed it and set upon it the beginnings of a
resolute expression that accorded ill with the rest of his open
freshness And when he had surveyed the sky and the distant hills and
the little rose bushes that occupied the leisure of the force his eyes
fell upon Bealby

Indecision has ruined more men than wickedness And when one has slept
rough and eaten nothing and one is conscious of a marred unclean
appearance it is hard to face ones situations What Bealby had
intended to do was to go right up to a policeman and say to him simply
and frankly I want to turn Kings Evidence please I was in that
burglary where there was a dead old man and a workbox and a woman and a
dog I was led astray by a bad character and I did not mean to do it
And really it was him that did it and not me

But now his tongue clove to the roof of his mouth he felt he could not
speak could not go through with it His heart had gone down into his
feet Perhaps he had caught the tramps constitutional aversion to the
police He affected not to see the observant figure in the doorway He
assumed a slack careless bearing like one who reads by chance idly He
lifted his eyebrows to express unconcern He pursed his mouth to whistle
but no whistle came He stuck his hands into his pockets pulled up his
feet as one pulls up plants by the roots and strolled away

He quickened his stroll as he supposed by imperceptible degrees He
glanced back and saw that the young policeman had come out of the
station and was reading the notice And as the young policeman read he
looked ever and again at Bealby like one who checks off items

Bealby quickened his pace and then doing his best to suggest by the
movements of his back a more boyish levity quite unconnected with the
law he broke into a trot

Then presently he dropped back into a walking pace pretended to see
something in the hedge stopped and took a sidelong look at the young
policeman

He was coming along with earnest strides every movement of his
suggested a stealthy hurry

Bealby trotted and then becoming almost frank about it ran He took to
his heels

From the first it was not really an urgent chase it was a stalking
rather than a hunt because the young policeman was too young and shy
and lacking in confidence really to run after a boy without any definite
warrant for doing so When anyone came along he would drop into a smart
walk and pretend not to be looking at Bealby but just going somewhere
briskly And after two miles of it he desisted and stood for a time
watching a heap of mangold wurzel directly and the disappearance of
Bealby obliquely and then when Bealby was quite out of sight he turned
back thoughtfully towards his proper place

On the whole he considered he was well out of it He might have made a
fool of himself

And yetfive pounds reward




                              CHAPTER VII
                       THE BATTLE OF CRAYMINSTER


                                   

Bealby was beginning to realize that running away from ones situation
and setting up for oneself is not so easy and simple a thing as it had
appeared during those first days with the caravan Three things he
perceived had arisen to pursue him two that followed in the daylight
the law and the tramp and a third that came back at twilight the
terror of the darkness And within there was a hollow faintness for the
afternoon was far advanced and he was extremely hungry He had dozed
away the early afternoon in the weedy corner of a wood But for his
hunger I think he would have avoided Crayminster

Within a mile of that place he had come upon the Missing notice again
stuck to the end of a barn He had passed it askance and then with a
sudden inspiration returned and tore it down Somehow with the daylight
his idea of turning Kings Evidence against the tramp had weakened He
no longer felt sure

Mustnt one wait and be asked first to turn Kings Evidence

Suppose they said he had merely confessed

The Crayminster street had a picturesque nutritious look Halfway down
it was the White Hart with cyclist club signs on its walls and geraniums
over a white porch and beyond a house being built and already at the
roofing pitch To the right was a bakers shop diffusing a delicious
suggestion of buns and cake and to the left a little comfortable
sweetstuff window and a glimpse of tables and a board Teas Tea He
resolved to break into his ninepence boldly and generously Very likely
they would boil him an egg for a penny or so Yet on the other hand if
he just had three or four buns soft new buns He hovered towards the
bakers shop and stopped short That bill was in the window

He wheeled about sharply and went into the sweetstuff shop and found a
table with a white cloth and a motherly little woman in a large cap
Tea He could have an egg and some thick bread and butter and a cup of
tea for fivepence He sat down respectfully to await her preparations

But he was uneasy

He knew quite well that she would ask him questions For that he was
prepared He said he was walking from his home in London to Someport to
save the fare But youre so dirty said the motherly little woman I
sent my luggage by post mam and I lost my way and didnt get it And
I dont much mind mam if you dont Not washing

All that he thought he did quite neatly But he wished there was not
that bill in the bakers window opposite and he wished he hadnt quite
such a hunted feeling A faint claustrophobia affected him He felt the
shop might be a trap He would be glad to get into the open again Was
there a way out behind if for example a policeman blocked the door He
hovered to the entrance while his egg was boiling and then when he saw a
large fat baker surveying the world with an afternoon placidity upon his
face he went back and sat by the table He wondered if the baker had
noted him

He had finished his egg he was drinking his tea with appreciative
noises when he discovered that the baker had noted him Bealbys
eyes at first inanely open above the tilting tea cup were suddenly
riveted on something that was going on in the bakers window From where
he sat he could see that detestable bill and then slowly feeling about
for it he beheld a hand and a floury sleeve The bill was drawn up and
vanished and then behind a glass shelf of fancy bread and a glass shelf
of buns something pink and indistinct began to move jerkily It was a
human face and it was trying to peer into the little refreshment shop
that sheltered Bealby

Bealbys soul went faint

He had one inadequate idea Might I go out he said by your back
way

There isnt a back way said the motherly little woman Theres a
yard

If I might said Bealby and was out in it

No way at all High walls on every side He was back like a shot in the
shop and now the baker was halfway across the road Fivepence said
Bealby and gave the little old woman sixpence Here she cried take
your penny

He did not wait He darted out of the door

The baker was all over the way of escape He extended arms that seemed
abnormally long and with a weak cry Bealby found himself trapped
Trapped but not hopelessly He knew how to do it He had done it in
milder forms before but now he did it with all his being Under the
diaphragm of the baker smote Bealbys hard little head and instantly he
was away running up the quiet sunny street Man when he assumed the
erect attitude made a hostage of his belly It is a proverb among the
pastoral Berbers of the Atlas mountains that the man who extends his
arms in front of an angry ram is a fool

It seemed probable to Bealby that he would get away up the street The
baker was engaged in elaborately falling backward making the most of
sitting down in the road and the wind had been knocked out of him so
that he could not shout He emitted Stop him in large whispers Away
ahead there were only three builders men sitting under the wall beyond
the White Hart consuming tea out of their tea cans But the boy who was
trimming the top of the tall privet hedge outside the doctors saw the
assault of the baker and incontinently uttered the shout that the baker
could not Also he fell off his steps with great alacrity and started in
pursuit of Bealby A young man from anywhereperhaps the grocers
shopalso started for Bealby But the workmen were slow to rise to the
occasion Bealby could have got past them And then abruptly at the
foot of the street ahead the tramp came into view a battered
disconcerting figure His strawcoloured hat which had recently been
wetted and dried in the sun was a swaying mop The sight of Bealby
seemed to rouse him from some disagreeable meditations He grasped the
situation with a terrible quickness Regardless of the wisdom of the
pastoral Berbers he extended his arms and stood prepared to intercept

Bealby thought at the rate of a hundred thoughts to the minute He
darted sideways and was up the ladder and among the beams and rafters of
the unfinished roof before the pursuit had more than begun Here come
off that cried the foreman builder only now joining in the hunt with
any sincerity He came across the road while Bealby regarded him
wickedly from the rafters above Then as the good man made to ascend
Bealby got him neatly on the hat it was a bowler hat with a tile This
checked the advance There was a disposition to draw a little off and
look up at Bealby One of the younger builders from the opposite
sidewalk got him very neatly in the ribs with a stone But two other
shots went wide and Bealby shifted to a more covered position behind the
chimney stack

From here however he had a much less effective command of the ladder
and he perceived that his tenure of the new house was not likely to be a
long one

Below men parleyed Who is e asked the foreman builder Whered
e come from Es a brasted little thief said the tramp Es one
of the wust characters on the road The baker was recovering his voice
now Theres a reward out for im he said and e butted me in the
stummick

Ow much reward asked the foreman builder

Five pound for the man who catches him

Ere cried the foreman builder in an arresting voice to the tramp
Just stand away from that ladder

Whatever else Bealby might or might not be one thing was very clear
about him and that was that he was a fugitive And the instinct of
humanity is to pursue fugitives Man is a hunting animal enquiry into
the justice of a case is an altogether later accretion to his complex
nature and that is why whatever you are or whatever you do you should
never let people get you on the run There is a joy in the mere fact of
hunting the sight of a scarlet coat and a hound will brighten a whole
village and now Crayminster was rousing itself like a sleeper who wakes
to sunshine and gay music People were looking out of windows and coming
out of shops a policeman appeared and heard the bakers simple story a
brisk hatless young man in a white apron and with a pencil behind his
ear became prominent Bealby peeping over the ridge of the roof looked
a thoroughly dirty and unpleasant little creature to all these people
The only spark of human sympathy for him below was in the heart of the
little old woman in the cap who had given him his breakfast She
surveyed the roof of the new house from the door of her shop she hoped
Bealby wouldnt hurt himself up there and she held his penny change
clutched in her hand in her apron pocket with a vague idea that perhaps
presently if he ran past she could very quickly give it him


                                   

Considerable delay in delivering the assault on the house was caused by
the foremans insistence that he alone should ascend the ladder to
capture Bealby He was one of those regularfeatured men with large
heads who seem to have inflexible backbones he was large and fair and
full with a sweetish chest voice and in all his movements authoritative
and deliberate Whenever he made to ascend he discovered that people
were straying into his building and he had to stop and direct his men
how to order them off Inside his large head he was trying to arrange
everybody to cut off Bealbys line of retreat without risking that
anybody but himself should capture the fugitive It was none too easy
and it knitted his brows Meanwhile Bealby was able to reconnoitre the
adjacent properties and to conceive plans for a possible line of escape
He also got a few tiles handy against when the rush up the ladder came
At the same time two of the younger workmen were investigating the
possibility of getting at him from inside the house There was still no
staircase but there were ways of clambering They had heard about the
reward and they knew that they must do this before the foreman realized
their purpose and this a little retarded them In their pockets they
had a number of stones ammunition in reserve if it came again to
throwing

Bealby was no longer fatigued nor depressed anxiety for the future was
lost in the excitement of the present and his heart told him that come
what might getting on to the roof was an extraordinarily good dodge

And if only he could bring off a certain jump he had in mind there were
other dodges

In the village street an informal assembly of leading citizens a little
recovered now from their first nervousness about flying tiles discussed
the problem of Bealby There was Mumby the draper and vegetarian with
the bass voice and the big black beard He advocated the fire engine He
was one of the volunteer fire brigade and never so happy as when he was
wearing his helmet He had come out of his shop at the shouting Schocks
the butcher and his boy were also in the street Schockss yard with
its heap of manure and fodder bounded the new house on the left Rymell
the vet emerged from the billiard room of the White Hart and with his
head a little on one side was watching Bealby and replying attentively
to the baker who was asking him a number of questions that struck him
as irrelevant All the White Hart people were in the street

I suppose Mr Rymell said the baker theres a mort of dangerous
things in a mans belly round about is Stummick

Tiles said Mr Rymell Loose bricks It wouldnt do if he started
dropping those

I was saying Mr Rymell said the baker after a pause for digestion
is a man likely to be injured badly by a Blaw in his stummick

Mr Rymell stared at him for a moment with unresponsive eyes More
likely to get you in the head he said and then Here Whats that
fool of a carpenter going to do

The tramp was hovering on the outskirts of the group of besiegers
vindictive but dispirited He had been brought to from his fit and given
a shilling by the old gentleman but he was dreadfully wet between his
shirthe wore a shirt under three waistcoats and a coatand his skin
because the old gentlemans method of revival had been to syringe him
suddenly with cold water It had made him weep with astonishment and
misery Now he saw no advantage in claiming Bealby publicly His part
he felt was rather a waiting one What he had to say to Bealby could be
best said without the assistance of a third person And he wanted to
understand more of this talk about a reward If there was a reward out
for Bealby

Thats not a bad dodge said Rymell changing his opinion of the
foreman suddenly as that individual began his ascent of the ladder with
a bricklayers hod carried shieldwise above his head He went up with
difficulty and slowly because of the extreme care he took to keep his
head protected But no tiles came Bealby had discovered a more
dangerous attack developing inside the house and was already in retreat
down the other side of the building

He did a leap that might have hurt him badly taking off from the corner
of the house and jumping a good twelve feet on to a big heap of straw in
the butchers yard He came down on all fours and felt a little jarred
for an instant and then he was up again and had scrambled up by a heap
of manure to the top of the butchers wall He was over that and into
Maccullums yard next door before anyone in the front of the new house
had realized that he was in flight Then one of the two workmen who had
been coming up inside the house saw him from the oblong opening that was
some day to be the upstairs bedroom window and gave tongue

It was thirty seconds later and after Bealby had vanished from the
butchers wall that the foreman still clinging to his hod appeared
over the ridge of the roof At the workmans shout the policeman who
with the preventive disposition of his profession had hitherto been
stopping anyone from coming into the unfinished house turned about and
ran out into its brick and plaster and timberlittered backyard
whereupon the crowd in the street realizing that the quarry had gone
away and no longer restrained came pouring partly through the house and
partly round through the butchers gate into his yard

Bealby had had a check

He had relied upon the tarred felt roof of the mushroom shed of
Maccullum the tailor and breechesmaker to get him to the wall that gave
upon Mr Benshaws strawberry fields and he had not seen from his roof
above the ramshackle glazed outhouse which Maccullum called his workroom
and in which four industrious tailors were working in an easy
dishabille The roof of the shed was the merest tarred touchwood it had
perished as felt long ago it collapsed under Bealby he went down into
a confusion of mushrooms and mushroombed he blundered out trailing
mushrooms and spawn and rich matter he had a ninefoot wall to
negotiate and only escaped by a hairsbreadth from the clutch of a
little redslippered man who came dashing out from the workroom But by
a happy use of the top of the dustbin he did just get away over the wall
in time and the redslippered tailor who was not good at walls was
left struggling to imitate an ascent that had looked easy enough until
he came to try it

For a moment the little tailor struggled alone and then both Maccullums
little domain and the butchers yard next door and the little patch of
space behind the new house were violently injected with a crowd of
active people all confusedly on the Bealby trail Someone he never
knew who gave the little tailor a legup and then his red slippers
twinkled over the wall and he was leading the hunt into the market
gardens of Mr Benshaw A collarless colleague in list slippers and
conspicuous braces followed The policeman after he had completed the
wreck of Mr Maccullums mushroom shed came next and then Mr
Maccullum with no sense of times and seasons anxious to have a
discussion at once upon the question of this damage Mr Maccullum was
out of breath and he never got further with this projected conversation
than Here This he repeated several times as opportunity seemed to
offer The remaining tailors got to the top of the wall more sedately
with the help of the Maccullum kitchen steps and dropped Mr Schocks
followed breathing hard and then a fresh jet of humanity came
squirting into the gardens through a gap in the fence at the back of the
building site This was led by the young workman who had first seen
Bealby go away Hard behind him came Rymell the vet the grocers
assistant the doctors pageboy and less briskly the baker Then the
tramp Then Mumby and Schockss boy Then a number of other people The
seeking of Bealby had assumed the dimensions of a Hue and Cry

The foreman with the large head and the upright back was still on the
new roof he was greatly distressed at the turn things had taken and
shouted his claims to a major share in the capture of Bealby mixed with
his opinions of Bealby and a good deal of mere swearing to a sunny but
unsympathetic sky


                                   

Mr Benshaw was a small holder a sturdy English yeoman of the new
school He was an AntiSocialist a selfhelper an independentspirited
man He had a steadily growing banking account and a plain but sterile
wife and he was dark in complexion and so erect in his bearing as to
seem a little to lean forward Usually he wore a sort of grey
gamekeepers suit with brown gaiters except on Sundays when the coat
was black he was addicted to bowler hats that accorded ill with his
large grave greycoloured face and he was altogether a very sound
strong man His bowler hats did but accentuate that He had no time for
vanities even the vanity of dressing consistently He went into the
nearest shop and just bought the cheapest hat he could and so he got
hats designed for the youthful and giddy hats with flighty crowns and
flippant bows and amorous brims that undulated attractively to set off
flushed and foolish young faces It made his unrelenting face look
rather like the Puritans under the Stuart monarchy

He was a horticulturist rather than a farmer He had begun his career in
cheap lodgings with a field of early potatoes and cabbages supplemented
by employment but with increased prosperity his area of cultivation had
extended and his methods intensified He now grew considerable
quantities of strawberries raspberries celery seakale asparagus
early peas late peas and onions and consumed more stable manure than
any other cultivator within ten miles of Crayminster He was beginning
to send cut flowers to London He had half an acre of glass and he was
rapidly extending it He had built himself a cottage on lines of austere
economy and a bonylooking dwelling house for some of his men He also
owned a number of useful sheds of which tar and corrugated iron were
conspicuous features His home was furnished with the utmost
respectability and notably joyless even in a countryside where gaiety
is regarded as an impossible quality in furniture He was already in a
small local way a mortgagee Good fortune had not turned the head of Mr
Benshaw nor robbed him of the feeling that he was a particularly
deserving person entitled to a preferential treatment from a country
which in his plain unsparing way he felt that he enriched

In many ways he thought that the country was careless of his needs And
in none more careless than in the laws relating to trespass Across his
dominions ran three footpaths and one of these led to the public
elementary school That he should have to maintain this latterand if he
did not keep it in good order the children spread out and made parallel
tracks among his cultivationsseemed to him a thing almost intolerably
unjust He mended it with cinders acetylene refuse which he believed
and hoped to be thoroughly bad for boots and a peculiarly slimy chalky
clay and he put on a board at each end Keep to the footpaths
Trespassers will be prosecuted by Order which he painted himself to
save expense when he was confined indoors by the influenza Still more
unjust it would be he felt for him to spend money upon effective
fencing and he could find no fencing cheap enough and ugly enough and
painful enough and impossible enough to express his feelings in the
matter Every day the children streamed to and fro marking how his
fruits ripened and his produce became more esculent And other people
pursued these tracks many Mr Benshaw was convinced went to and fro
through his orderly crops who had no business whatever no honest
business to pass that way Either he concluded they did it to annoy
him or they did it to injure him This continual invasion aroused in
Mr Benshaw all that stern anger against unrighteousness latent in our
race which more than any other single force has made America and the
Empire what they are today Once already he had been robbeda raid upon
his raspberriesand he felt convinced that at any time he might be
robbed again He had made representations to the local authority to get
the footpath closed but in vain They defended themselves with the
paltry excuse that the children would then have to go nearly a mile
round to the school

It was not only the tyranny of these footpaths that offended Mr
Benshaws highly developed sense of Individual Liberty All round his
rather straggling dominions his neighbours displayed an ungenerous
indisposition to maintain their fences to his satisfaction In one or
two places in abandonment of his clear rights in the matter he had at
his own expense supplemented these lax defences with light barbed wire
defences But it was not a very satisfactory sort of barbed wire He
wanted barbed wire with extra spurs like a fighting cock he wanted
barbed wire that would start out after nightfall and attack passersby
This boundary trouble was universal in a way it was worse than the
footpaths which after all only affected the Cage Fields where his
strawberries grew Except for the yard and garden walls of Maccullum and
Schocks and that side there was not really a satisfactory foot of
enclosure all round Mr Benshaw On the one side rats and peoples dogs
and scratching cats came in on the other side rabbits The rabbits were
intolerable and recently there had been a rise of nearly thirty per cent
in the price of wire netting

Mr Benshaw wanted to hurt rabbits he did not want simply to kill them
he wanted so to kill them as to put the fear of death into the burrows
He wanted to kill them so that scared little furry survivors with their
tails as white as ghosts would go lolloping home and say I say you
chaps wed better shift out of this Were up against a Strong
Determined Man

I have made this lengthy statement of Mr Benshaws economic and moral
difficulties in order that the reader should understand the peculiar
tension that already existed upon this side of Crayminster It has been
necessary to do so now because in a few seconds there will be no further
opportunity for such preparations

There had been trouble I may add very hastily about the shooting of
Mr Benshaws gun a shower of small shot had fallen out of the twilight
upon the umbrella and basket of old Mrs Frobisher And only a week ago
an unsympathetic bench after a hearing of over an hour and in the face
of overwhelming evidence had refused to convict little Lucy Mumby aged
eleven of stealing fruit from Mr Benshaws fields She had been caught
redhanded

At the very moment that Bealby was butting the baker in the stomach Mr
Benshaw was just emerging from his austere cottage after a wholesome but
inexpensive high tea in which he had finished up two leftover cold
sausages and he was considering very deeply the financial side of a
furious black fence that he had at last decided should pen in the school
children from further depredations It should be of splintery tarred
deal and high with wellpointed tops studded with sharp nails and he
believed that by making the path only two feet wide a real saving of
ground for cultivation might be made and a very considerable discomfort
for the public arranged to compensate for his initial expense The
thought of a narrow lane which would in winter be characterized by an
excessive slimness and from which there would be no lateral escape was
pleasing to a mind by no means absolutely restricted to considerations
of pounds shillings and pence In his hand after his custom he carried
a hoe on the handle of which feet were marked so that it was available
not only for destroying the casual weed but also for purposes of
measurement With this he now checked his estimate and found that here
he would reclaim as much as three feet of trodden waste here a full
two

Absorbed in these calculations he heeded little the growth of a certain
clamour from the backs of the houses bordering on the High Street It
did not appear to concern him and Mr Benshaw made it almost
ostentatiously his rule to mind his own business His eyes remained
fixed on the lumpy dusty sunbaked track that with an intelligent
foresight he saw already transformed into a deterrent slough of despond
for the young

Then quite suddenly the shouting took on a new note He glanced over his
shoulder almost involuntarily and discovered that after all this uproar
was his business Amazingly his business His mouth assumed a
Cromwellian fierceness His grip tightened on his hoe That anyone
should dare But it was impossible

His dominions were being invaded with a peculiar boldness and violence

Ahead of everyone else and running with wild wavings of the arms across
his strawberries was a small and very dirty little boy He impressed Mr
Benshaw merely as a pioneer Some thirty yards behind him was a little
collarless shortsleeved man in red slippers running with great
effrontery and behind him another still more denuded lunatic also in
list slippers and with bracesbraces of inconceivable levity And then
Wiggs the policeman hotly followed by Mr Maccullum Then more
distraught tailors and Schocks the butcher But a louder shout heralded
the main attack and Mr Benshaw turned his eyesalready they were
slightly bloodshot eyesto the right and saw pouring through the
broken hedge a disorderly crowd Rymell whom he had counted his friend
the grocers assistant the doctors boy some strangersMumby

At the sight of Mumby Mr Benshaw leapt at a conclusion He saw it all
The whole place was rising against him they were asserting some
infernal new rightofway MumbyMumby had got them to do it All the
fruits of fifteen years of toil all the care and accumulation of Mr
Benshaws prime were to be trampled and torn to please a drapers
spite

Sturdy yeoman as Mr Benshaw was he resolved instantly to fight for his
liberties One moment he paused to blow the powerful police whistle he
carried in his pocket and then rushed forward in the direction of the
hated Mumby the leader of trespassers the parent and abetter and
defender of the criminal Lucy He took the hurrying panting man almost
unawares and with one wild sweep of the hoe felled him to the earth
Then he staggered about and smote again but not quite in time to get
the head of Mr Rymell

This whistle he carried was part of a systematic campaign he had
developed against trespassers and fruit stealers He and each of his
assistants carried one and at the first shrill noteit was his
ruleeveryone seized on every weapon that was handy and ran to pursue
and capture All his assistants were extraordinarily prompt in
responding to these alarms which were often the only break in long days
of strenuous and strenuously directed toil So now with an astonishing
promptitude and animated faces men appeared from sheds and greenhouses
and distant patches of culture hastening to the assistance of their
dour employer

It says much for the amiable relations that existed between employers
and employed in those days before Syndicalism became the creed of the
younger workers that they did hurry to his assistance

But many rapid things were to happen before they came into action For
first a strange excitement seized upon the tramp A fantastic delusive
sense of social rehabilitation took possession of his soul Here he was
pitted against a formidable hoewielding man who for some inscrutable
reason was resolved to cover the retreat of Bealby And all the world
it seemed was with the tramp and against this hoewielder All the
tremendous forces of human society against which the tramp had
struggled for so many years whose power he knew and feared as only the
outlaw can had suddenly come into line with him Across the
strawberries to the right there was even a policeman hastening to join
the majority a policeman closely followed by a tradesman of the
blackest most respectable quality The tramp had a vision of himself as
a respectable man heroically leading respectable people against
outcasts He dashed the lank hair from his eyes waved his arms
laterally and then with a loud strange cry flung himself towards Mr
Benshaw Two pairs of superimposed coattails flapped behind him And
then the hoe whistled through the air and the tramp fell to the ground
like a sack

But now Schockss boy had grasped his opportunity He had been working
discreetly round behind Mr Benshaw and as the hoe smote he leapt upon
that heros back and seized him about the neck with both arms and bore
him staggering to the ground and Rymell equally quick and used to the
tackling of formidable creatures had snatched and twisted away the hoe
and grappled Mr Benshaw almost before he was down The first of Mr
Benshaws helpers to reach the fray found the issue decided his master
held down conclusively and a growing circle trampling down a wide area
of strawberry plants about the panting group

Mr Mumby more frightened than hurt was already sitting up but the
tramp with a glowing wound upon his cheekbone and an expression of
astonishment in his face lay low and pawed the earth

What dyou mean gasped Mr Rymell hitting people about with that
hoe

What dyou mean groaned Mr Benshaw running across my
strawberries

We were going after that boy

Pounds and pounds worth of damage Mischief and wickedness Mumby

Mr Rymell suddenly realizing the true values of the situation
released Mr Benshaws hands and knelt up Look here Mr Benshaw he
said you seem to be under the impression we are trespassing

Mr Benshaw struggling into a sitting position was understood to
enquire with some heat what Mr Rymell called it Schockss boy picked
up the hat with the erotic brim and handed it to the horticulturist
silently and respectfully

We were not trespassing said Mr Rymell We were following up that
boy He was trespassing if you like By the byewhere is the
boy Has anyone caught him

At the question attention which had been focussed upon Mr Benshaw and
his hoe came round Across the field in the direction of the sunlit
half acre of glass the little tailor was visible standing gingerly and
picking up his red slippers for the third timethey would come off in
that loose good soil everybody else had left the trail to concentrate
on Mr Benshawand Bealby Bealby was out of sight He had escaped
clean got away

What boy asked Mr Benshaw

Ferocious little beast whos fought us like a rat Been committing all
sorts of crimes about the country Five pounds reward for him

Fruit stealing asked Mr Benshaw

Yes said Mr Rymell chancing it

Mr Benshaw reflected slowly His eyes surveyed his trampled crops
Gooo Lord he cried Look at those strawberries His voice
gathered violence And that lout there he said Whyhes lying on
them Thats the brute who went for me

You got him a pretty tidy one side the head said Maccullum

The tramp rolled over on some fresh strawberries and groaned pitifully

Hes hurt said Mr Mumby

The tramp flopped and lay still

Get some water said Rymell standing up

At the word water the tramp started convulsively rolled over and sat
up with a dazed expression

No water he said weakly No more water and then catching Mr
Benshaws eye he got rather quickly to his feet

Everybody who wasnt already standing was getting up and everyone now
was rather carefully getting himself off any strawberry plant he had
chanced to find himself smashing in the excitement of the occasion

Thats the man that started in on me said Mr Benshaw Whats he
doing here Who is he

Who are you my man What business have you to be careering over this
field asked Mr Rymell

I was only elping said the tramp

Nice help said Mr Benshaw

I thought that boy was a thief or something

And so you made a rush at me

I didnt exactlysirI thought you was elping im

You be off anyhow said Mr Benshaw Whatever you thought

Yes you be off said Mr Rymell

Thats the way my man said Mr Benshaw We havent any jobs for
you The sooner we have you out of it the better for everyone Get right
on to the path and keep it And with a desolating sense of exclusion
the tramp withdrew Theres pounds and pounds worth of damage here
said Mr Benshaw This jobll cost me a pretty penny Look at them
berries there Why they aint fit for jam And all done by one
confounded boy An evil light came into Mr Benshaws eyes You leave
him to me and my chaps If hes gone up among those sheds therewell
settle with him Anyhow theres no reason why my fruit should be
trampled worse than it has been Fruit stealer you say he is

They live on the country this time of year said Mr Mumby

And catch them doing a days work picking said Mr Benshaw I know
the sort

Theres a reward of five pounds for im already said the baker


                                   

You perceive how humanitarian motives may sometimes defeat their own
end and how little Lady Laxtons wellintentioned handbills were
serving to rescue Bealby Instead they were turning him into a scared
and hunted animal In spite of its manifest impossibility he was
convinced that the reward and this pursuit had to do with his burglary
of the poultry farm and that his capture would be but the preliminary
to prison trial and sentence His one remaining idea was to get away
But his escape across the market gardens had left him so blown and
spent that he was obliged to hide up for a time in this perilous
neighbourhood before going on He saw a disusedlooking shed in the
lowest corner of the gardens behind the greenhouses and by doubling
sharply along a hedge he got to it unseen It was not disusednothing in
Mr Benshaws possession ever was absolutely disused but it was filled
with horticultural lumber with old calcium carbide tins with broken
wheelbarrows and damaged ladders awaiting repair with some ragged
wheeling planks and surplus rolls of roofing felt At the back were some
unhinged shed doors leaning against the wall and between them Bealby
tucked himself neatly and became still glad of any respite from the
chase

He would wait for twilight and then get away across the meadows at the
back and then goHe didnt know whither And now he had no confidence in
the wild world any more A qualm of homesickness for the compact little
gardeners cottage at Shonts came to Bealby Why as a matter of fact
wasnt he there now

He ought to have tried more at Shonts

He ought to have minded what they told him and not have taken up a
toasting fork against Thomas Then he wouldnt now have been a hunted
burglar with a reward of five pounds on his head and nothing in his
pocket but threepence and a pack of greasy playing cards a box of
sulphur matches and various objectionable sundries none of which were
properly his own

If only he could have his time over again

Such wholesome reflections occupied his thoughts until the onset of the
dusk stirred him to departure He crept out of his hidingplace and
stretched his limbs which had got very stiff and was on the point of
reconnoitring from the door of the shed when he became aware of stealthy
footsteps outside

With the quickness of an animal he shot back into his hidingplace The
footsteps had halted For a long time it seemed the unseen waited
listening Had he heard Bealby

Then someone fumbled with the door of the shed it opened and there was
a long pause of cautious inspection

Then the unknown had shuffled into the shed and sat down on a heap of
matting

Gaw said a voice

The tramps

If ever I struck a lefthanded Mascot it was that boy said the tramp
The little swine

For the better part of two minutes he went on from this mild beginning
to a descriptive elaboration of Bealby For the first time in his life
Bealby learnt how unfavourable was the impression he might leave on a
fellow creatures mind

Took even my matches cried the tramp and tried this statement over
with variations

First that old fool with his syringe The tramps voice rose in angry
protest Heres a chap dying epilepsy on your doorstep and all you can
do is to squirt cold water at him Cold water Why you might kill a
man doing that And then say youd thoughtd bring im rnd Bring im
rnd You be jolly glad I didnt stash your silly face in You
misbegotten old fool Whats a shilling for wetting a man to is skin
Wet through I was Running inside my shirtdripping And then the
blooming boy clears

I dont know what boys are coming to cried the tramp These board
schools it is Gets old of everything e can and bunks Gaw if I get
my ands on im Ill show im Ill

For some time the tramp revelled in the details for the most part
crudely surgical of his vengeance upon Bealby

Then theres that dog bite Ow do I know ow thats going to turn t
If I get idrophobia blowed if I dont bite some of em Idrophobia
Screaming and foaming Nice death for a manmy time o life Bark I
shall Bark and bite

And this is your world said the tramp This is the world you put
people into and expect em to be appy

Id like to bite that doughfaced fool with the silly at Id enjoy
biting im Id spit it out but Id bite it right enough Wiping abt
with is O Gaw Get off my ground Be orf with you Slash E ought
to be shut up

Wheres the justice of it shouted the tramp Wheres the right and
the sense of it What ave I done that I should always get the under
side Why should I be stuck on the under side of everything Theres
worse men than me in all sorts of positions Judges there are
Orrible Kerecters Ministers and people Ive read abt em in the
papers

Its we tramps are the scapegoats Somebodys got to suffer so as the
police can show a face Gaw Some of these days Ill do something Ill
do something Youll drive me too far with it I tell you

He stopped suddenly and listened Bealby had creaked

Gaw What can one do said the tramp after a long interval

And then complaining more gently the tramp began to feel about to make
his simple preparations for the night

Unt me out of this I expect said the tramp And many sleeping in
feather beds that aint fit to old a candle to me Not a hordinary
farthing candle


                                   

The subsequent hour or so was an interval of tedious tension for Bealby

After vast spaces of time he was suddenly aware of three vertical
threads of light He stared at them with mysterious awe until he
realized that they were just the moonshine streaming through the cracks
of the shed

The tramp tossed and muttered in his sleep

Footsteps

YesFootsteps

Then voices

They were coming along by the edge of the field and coming and talking
very discreetly

Ugh said the tramp and then softly whats that Then he too
became noiselessly attentive

Bealby could hear his own heart beating

The men were now close outside the shed He wouldnt go in there said
Mr Benshaws voice He wouldnt dare Anyhow well go up by the glass
first Ill let him have the whole barrelful of oats if I get a glimpse
of him If hed gone away theyd have caught him in the road

The footsteps receded There came a cautious rustling on the part of the
tramp and then his feet padded softly to the door of the shed He
struggled to open it and then with a jerk got it open a few inches a
great bar of moonlight leapt and lay still across the floor of the shed
Bealby advanced his head cautiously until he could see the black obscure
indications of the tramps back as he peeped out

Now whispered the tramp and opened the door wider Then he ducked
his head down and darted out of sight leaving the door open behind him

Bealby questioned whether he should follow He came out a few steps and
then went back at a shout from away up the garden There he goes
shouted a voice in the shadow of the hedge

Look out JimBangand a yelp

Stand away Ive got another barrel

Bang

Then silence for a time and then the footsteps coming back

That ought to teach him said Mr Benshaw First time I got him
fair and I think I peppered him a bit the second Couldnt see very
well but I heard him yell He wont forget that in a hurry Not him
Theres nothing like oats for fruit stealers Jim just shut that door
will you Thats where he was hiding

It seemed a vast time to Bealby before he ventured out into the summer
moonlight and a very pitiful and outcast little Bealby he felt himself
to be

He was beginning to realize what it means to go beyond the narrow
securities of human society He had no friends no friends at all

He caught at and arrested a sob of selfpity

Perhaps after all it was not so late as Bealby had supposed There were
still lights in some of the houses and he had the privilege of seeing
Mr Benshaw going to bed with pensive deliberation Mr Benshaw wore a
flannel nightshirt and said quite a lengthy prayer before extinguishing
his candle Then suddenly Bealby turned nervously and made off through
the hedge A dog had barked

At first there were nearly a dozen lighted windows in Crayminster They
went out one by one He hung for a long time with a passionate
earnestness on the sole surviving one but that too went at last He
could have wept when at last it winked out He came down into the marshy
flats by the river but he did not like the way in which the water
sucked and swirled in the vague moonlight also he suddenly discovered a
great white horse standing quite still in the misty grass not thirty
yards away so he went up to and crossed the high road and wandered up
the hillside towards the allotments which attracted him by reason of
the sociability of the numerous tool sheds In a hedge near at hand a
young rabbit squealed sharply and was stilled Why

Then something like a short snake scrabbled by very fast through the
grass

Then he thought he saw the tramp stalking him noiselessly behind some
currant bushes That went on for some time but came to nothing

Then nothing pursued him nothing at all The gap the void came after
him The bodiless the faceless the formless these are evil hunters in
the night

What a cold still watching thing moonlight can be

He thought he would like to get his back against something solid and
found near one of the sheds a little heap of litter He sat down against
good tarred boards assured at least that whatever came must come in
front Whatever he did he was resolved he would not shut his eyes

That would be fatal

He awoke in broad daylight amidst a cheerful uproar of birds


                                   

And then again flight and pursuit were resumed

As Bealby went up the hill away from Crayminster he saw a man standing
over a spade and watching his retreat and when he looked back again
presently this man was following It was Lady Laxtons five pound reward
had done the thing for him

He was half minded to surrender and have done with it but jail he knew
was a dreadful thing of stone and darkness He would make one last
effort So he beat along the edge of a plantation and then crossed it
and forced his way through some gorse and came upon a sunken road that
crossed the hill in a gorselined cutting He struggled down the steep
bank At its foot regardless of him unaware of him a man sat beside a
motor bicycle with his fists gripped tight and his head downcast
swearing A county map was crumpled in his hand Damn he cried and
flung the map to the ground and kicked it and put his foot on it

Bealby slipped came down the bank with a run and found himself in the
road within a couple of yards of the blond features and angry eyes of
Captain Douglas When he saw the Captain and perceived himself
recognized he flopped downa done and finished Bealby


                                   

He had arrived just in time to interrupt the Captain in a wild and
reprehensible fit of passion

The Captain imagined it was a secret fit of passion He thought he was
quite alone and that no one could hear him or see him So he had let
himself shout and stamp to work off the nervous tensions that tormented
him beyond endurance

In the direst sense of the words the Captain was in love with Madeleine
He was in love quite beyond the bounds set by refined and decorous
people to this dangerous passion The primordial savage that lurks in so
many of us was uppermost in him He was not in love with her prettily or
delicately he was in love with her violently and vehemently He wanted
to be with her he wanted to be close to her he wanted to possess her
and nobody else to approach her He was so inflamed now that no other
interest in life had any importance except as it aided or interfered
with this desire He had forced himself in spite of this fever in his
blood to leave her to pursue Bealby and now he was regretting this
firmness furiously He had expected to catch Bealby overnight and bring
him back to the hotel in triumph But Bealby had been elusive There she
was away there hurt and indignantneglected

A laggard in love cried the Captain a dastard in war GodI run
away from everything First I leave the manuvres then her Unstable as
water thou shalt not prevail Water What does the confounded boy
matter What does he matter

And there she is Alone Shell flirtnaturally shell flirt Dont I
deserve it Havent I asked for it Just the one little time we might
have had together I fling it in her face You fool you laggard you
dastard And heres this map

A breathing moment

How the devil cried the Captain am I to find the little beast on
this map

And twice hes been within reach of my hand

No decision cried the Captain No instant grip What good is a
soldier without it What good is any man who will not leap at
opportunity I ought to have chased out last night after that fool and
his oats Then I might have had a chance

Chuck it Chuck the whole thing Go back to her Kneel to her kiss
her compel her

And what sort of reception am I likely to get

He crumpled the flapping map in his fist

And then suddenly out of nowhere Bealby came rolling down to his feet a
dishevelled and earthy Bealby But Bealby

Good Lord cried the Captain starting to his feet and holding the map
like a sword sheath

What do you want

For a second Bealby was a silent spectacle of misery

Oooh I want my breckfuss he burst out at last reduced to tears

Are you young Bealby asked the Captain seizing him by the shoulder

Theyre after me cried Bealby If they catch me theyll put me in
prison Where they dont give you anything It wasnt me did itand I
avent had anything to eatnot since yesterday

The Captain came rapidly to a decision There should be no more
faltering He saw his way clear before him He would actlike a
whistling sword Here jump up behind he said  hold on tight to
me


                                   

For a time there was a more than Napoleonic swiftness in the Captains
movements When Bealbys pursuer came up to the hedge that looks down
into the sunken road there was no Bealby no Captain nothing but a
torn and dishevelled county map an almost imperceptible odour of petrol
and a faint soundlike a distant mowing machineand the motor bicycle
was a mile away on the road to Beckinstone Eight miles eight rather
sickening miles Bealby did to Beckinstone in eleven minutes and there
in a little coffee house he was given breakfast with eggs and bacon and
marmalade Prime and his spirit was restored to him while the Captain
raided a bicycle and repairing shop and negotiated the hire of an
experienced but fairly comfortable wickerwork trailer And so to London
through the morning sunshine leaving tramps pursuers policemen
handbills bakers market gardeners terrors of the darkness and
everything upon the road behindand further behind and remote and
insignificantand so to the vanishing point

Some few words of explanation the Captain had vouchsafed and that was
all

Dont be afraid about it he said Dont be in the least bit afraid
You tell them about it just simply and truthfully exactly what you
did exactly how you got into it and out of it and all about it

Youre going to take me up to a Magistrate sir

Im going to take you up to the Lord Chancellor himself

And then they wont do anything

Nothing at all Bealby you trust me All youve got to do is to tell
the simple truth

It was pretty rough going in the trailer but very exciting If you
gripped the sides very hard and sat quite tight nothing very much
happened and also there was a strap across your chest And you went past
everything There wasnt a thing on the road the Captain didnt pass
lowing deeply with his great horn when they seemed likely to block his
passage And as for the burglary and everything it would all be
settled

The Captain also found that ride to London exhilarating At least he was
no longer hanging about he was getting to something He would be able
to go back to herand all his being now yearned to go back to herwith
things achieved with successes to show Hed found the boy He would go
straight to dear old uncle Chickney and uncle Chickney would put things
right with Moggeridge the boy would bear his testimony Moggeridge
would be convinced and all would be well again He might be back with
Madeleine that evening He would go back to her and she would see the
wisdom and energy of all he had done and she would lift that dear chin
of hers and smile that dear smile of hers and hold out her hand to be
kissed and the lights and reflections would play on that strong soft
neck of hers

They buzzed along stretches of common and stretches of straightedged
meadowland by woods and orchards by pleasant inns and slumbering
villages and the gates and lodges of country houses

These latter grew more numerous and presently they skirted a town and
then more road more villages and at last signs of a nearness to London
more frequent houses more frequent inns hoardings and advertisements
an asphalted sidewalk lamps a gasworks laundries a stretch of
suburban villadom a suburban railway station a suburbanized old town
an omnibus the head of a tramline a stretch of public common thick
with noticeboards a broad pavement somethingorother parade with a
row of shops

London




                              CHAPTER VIII
                          HOW BEALBY EXPLAINED


                                   

Lord Chickney was only slightly older than Lord Moggeridge but he had
not worn nearly so well His hearing was not good though he would never
admit it and the loss of several teeth greatly affected his
articulation One might generalize and say that neither physically nor
mentally do soldiers wear so well as lawyers The army ages men sooner
than the law and philosophy it exposes them more freely to germs which
undermine and destroy and it shelters them more completely from
thought which stimulates and preserves A lawyer must keep his law
highly polished and uptodate or he hears of it within a fortnight a
general never realizes he is out of training and behind the times until
disaster is accomplished Since the magnificent retreat from
BondySatina in eightyseven and his five weeks defence of Barrowgast
with the subsequent operations the abilities of Lord Chickney had
never been exercised seriously at all But there was a certain
simplicity of manner and a tall drooping grizzled oldveteran
picturesqueness about him that kept him distinguished he was easy to
recognize on public occasions on account of his long moustaches and so
he got pointed out when greater men were ignored The autograph
collectors adored him Every morning he would spend half an hour writing
autographs and the habit was so strong in him that on Sundays when
there was no London post and autograph writing would have been wrong
anyhow he filled the time in copying out the epistle and gospel for the
day And he liked to be well in the foreground of public affairsif
possible wearing his decorations After the autographs he would work
sometimes for hours for various patriotic societies and more
particularly for those which would impose compulsory training upon every
man woman and child in the country He even belonged to a society for
drilling the butchers ponies and training big dogs as scouts He did
not understand how a country could be happy unless every city was
fortified and every citizen wore sidearms and the slightest error in
his dietary led to the most hideous nightmares of the Channel Tunnel or
reduced estimates and a land enslaved He wrote and toiled for these
societies but he could not speak for them on account of his teeth For
he had one peculiar weakness he had faced death in many forms but he
had never faced a dentist The thought of dentists gave him just the
same sick horror as the thought of invasion

He was a man of blameless private life a widower and childless In
later years he had come to believe that he had once been very deeply in
love with his cousin Susan who had married a rather careless husband
named Douglas both she and Douglas were dead now but he maintained a
touching affection for her two lively rather than satisfying sons He
called them his nephews and by the continuous attrition of affection he
had become their recognized uncle He was glad when they came to him in
their scrapes and he liked to be seen about with them in public places
They regarded him with considerable confidence and respect and an
affection that they sometimes blamed themselves for as not quite warm
enough for his merits But there is a kind of injustice about affection

He was really gratified when he got a wire from the less discreditable
of these two bright young relations saying Sorely in need of your
advice Hope to bring difficulties to you today at twelve

He concluded very naturally that the boy had come to some crisis in his
unfortunate entanglement with Madeleine Philips and he was flattered by
the trustfulness that brought the matter to him He resolved to be
delicate but wily honourable strictly honourable but steadily
patiently separative He paced his spacious study with his usual
mornings work neglected and rehearsed little sentences in his mind
that might be effective in the approaching interview There would
probably be emotion He would pat the lad on his shoulder and be himself
a little emotional I understand my boy he would say I understand

Dont forget my boy that Ive been a young man too

He would be emotional he would be sympathetic but also he must be a
man of the world Sort of thing that wont do you know my boy sort
of thing that people will not stand A soldiers wife has to be a
soldiers wife and nothing else Your business is to serve the king
notnot some celebrity Lovely no doubt I dont deny the charm of
herbut on the hoardings my boy Now dont you thinkdont you
thinktheres some nice pure girl somewhere sweet as violets new as
the dawn and ready to be yours a girl I mean a maiden fancy free
nothow shall I put ita woman of the world Wonderful I admitbut
seasoned Public My dear dear boy I knew your mother when she was a
girl a sweet pure girla thing of dewy freshness Ah Well I remember
her All these years my boyNothing Its difficult

Tears stood in his brave old blue eyes as he elaborated such phrases He
went up and down mumbling them through the defective teeth and the long
moustache and waving an eloquent hand


                                   

When Lord Chickneys thoughts had once started in any direction it was
difficult to turn them aside No doubt that concealed and repudiated
deafness helped his natural perplexity of mind Truth comes to some of
us as a still small voice but Lord Chickney needed shouting and prods
And Douglas did not get to him until he was finishing lunch Moreover
it was the weakness of Captain Douglas to talk in jerky fragments and
undertones rather than clearly and fully in the American fashion Tell
me all about it my boy said Lord Chickney Tell me all about it
Dont apologize for your clothes I understand Motor bicycle and just
come up But have you had any lunch Eric

Alan unclenot Eric My brother is Eric

Well I called him Alan Tell me all about it Tell me what has
happened What are you thinking of doing Just put the positions before
me To tell you the truth Ive been worrying over this business for some
time

Didnt know youd heard of it uncle He cant have talked about it
already Anyhowyou see all the awkwardness of the situation They say
the old chaps a thundering spiteful old devil when hes rousedand
theres no doubt he was roused Tremendously

Lord Chickney was not listening very attentively Indeed he was also
talking Not clear to me there was another man in it he was saying
That makes it more complicated my boy makes the row acuter Old
fellow eh Who

They came to a pause at the same moment

You speak so indistinctly complained Lord Chickney Who did you
say

I thought you understood Lord Moggeridge

Lord Lord Moggeridge My dear Boy But how

I thought you understood uncle

He doesnt want to marry her Tut Never Why the man must be sixty if
hes a day

Captain Douglas regarded his distinguished uncle for a moment with
distressed eyes Then he came nearer raised his voice and spoke more
deliberately

I dont know whether you quite understand uncle I am talking about
this affair at Shonts last weekend

My dear boy theres no need for you to shout If only you dont mumble
and clip your wordsand turn head over heels with your ideas Just tell
me about it plainly Who is Shonts One of those Liberal peers I seem
to have heard the name

Shonts uncle is the house the Laxtons have you knowLucy

Little Lucy I remember her Curls all down her back Married
the milkman But how does she come in Alan The storys
gettingcomplicated But thats the worst of these infernal
affairsthey always do get complicated Tangled skeins

                   Oh what a tangled web we weave
                   When first we venture to deceive

And now like a sensible man you want to get out of it

Captain Douglas was bright pink with the effort to control himself and
keep perfectly plain and straightforward His hair had become like tow
and little beads of perspiration stood upon his forehead

I spent last weekend at Shonts he said Lord Moggeridge also
there weekending Got it into his head that I was pulling his leg

Naturally my boy if he goes philandering At his time of life What
else can he expect

It wasnt philandering

Fine distinctions Fine distinctions Go onanyhow

He got it into his head that I was playing practical jokes upon him
Confused me with Eric It led to a rather firstclass row I had to get
out of the house Nothing else to do He brought all sorts of
accusations

Captain Douglas stopped short His uncle was no longer attending to him
They had drifted to the window of the study and the general was staring
with an excitement and intelligence that grew visibly at the spectacle
of Bealby and the trailer outside For Bealby had been left in the
trailer and he was sitting as good as gold waiting for the next step in
his vindication from the dark charge of burglary He was very
travelworn and the trailer was timeworn as well as travelworn and
both contrasted with the efficient neatness and newness of the motor
bicycle in front The contrast had attracted the attention of a tall
policeman who was standing in a state of elucidatory meditation
regarding Bealby Bealby was not regarding the policeman He had the
utmost confidence in Captain Douglas he felt sure that he would
presently be purged of all the horror of that dead old man and of the
brief unpremeditated plunge into crime but still for the present at any
rate he did not feel equal to staring a policeman out of countenance

From the window the policeman very largely obscured Bealby

Whenever hearts are simple there lurks romance Age cannot wither nor
custom stale her infinite diversity Suddenly out of your low kindly
diplomacies your sane manoftheworld intentions leaps the
imagination like a rocket flying from such safe securities bang into
the sky So it happened to the old general He became deaf to everything
but the appearances before him The world was jewelled with dazzling and
delightful possibilities His face was lit by a glow of genuine romantic
excitement He grasped his nephews arm He pointed His grizzled cheeks
flushed

That isnt he asked with something verging upon admiration in his
voice and manner a Certain Lady in disguise


                                   

It became clear to Captain Douglas that if ever he was to get to Lord
Moggeridge that day he must take his uncle firmly in hand Without even
attempting not to appear to shout he cried That is a little Boy That
is my Witness It is Most Important that I should get him to Lord
Moggeridge to tell his Story

What story cried the old commander pulling at his moustache and
still eyeing Bealby suspiciously

It took exactly half an hour to get Lord Chickney from that enquiry to
the telephone and even then he was still far from clear about the matter
in hand Captain Douglas got in most of the facts but he could not
eliminate an idea that it all had to do with Madeleine Whenever he
tried to say clearly that she was entirely outside the question the
general patted his shoulder and looked very wise and kind and said My
dear Boy I quite understand I quite understand Never mention a
lady No

So they started at last rather foggilyso far as things of the mind
went though the sun that day was brilliantand because of engine
trouble in Port Street the generals hansom reached Tenby Little Street
first and he got in a good five minutes preparing the Lord Chancellor
tactfully and carefully before the bicycle and its trailer came upon the
scene


                                   

Candler had been packing that morning with unusual solicitude for a
weekend at Tulliver Abbey His master had returned from the catastrophe
of Shonts fatigued and visibly aged and extraordinarily cross and
Candler looked to Tulliver Abbey to restore him to his former self
Nothing must be forgotten there must be no little hitches everything
from first to last must go on oiled wheels or it was clear his Lordship
might develop a desperate hostility to these excursions excursions
which Candler found singularly refreshing and entertaining during the
stresses of the session Tulliver Abbey was as good a house as Shonts
was bad Lady Checksammington ruled with the softness of velvet and the
strength of steel over a household of admirably efficient domestics and
there would be the best of people there Mr Evesham perhaps the
Loopers Lady Privet Andreas Doria and Mr Pernambuco great silken
mellow personages and diamondlike individualities amidst whom Lord
Moggeridges mind would be restfully active and his comfort quite
secure And as far as possible Candler wanted to get the books and
papers his master needed into the trunk or the small valise That habit
of catching up everything at the last moment and putting it under his
arm and the consequent need for alert picking up meant friction and
nervous wear and tear for both master and man

Lord Moggeridge rose at halfpast tenhe had been kept late overnight by
a heated discussion at the Aristotelianand breakfasted lightly upon a
chop and coffee Then something ruffled him something that came with
the letters Candler could not quite make out what it was but he
suspected another pamphlet by Dr Schiller It could not be the chop
because Lord Moggeridge was always wonderfully successful with chops
Candler looked through the envelopes and letters afterwards and found
nothing diagnostic and then he observed a copy of Mind torn across
and lying in the wastepaper basket

When I went out of the room said Candler discreetly examining this
Very likely its that there Schiller after all

But in this Candler was mistaken What had disturbed the Lord Chancellor
was a coarsely disrespectful article on the Absolute by a Cambridge
Rhodes scholar written in that flighty facetious strain that spreads
now like a pestilence over modern philosophical discussion Does the
Absolute on Lord Moggeridges own showing mean anything more than an
eloquent oiliness uniformly distributed through space and so on

Pretty bad

Lord Moggeridge early in life had deliberately acquired a quite
exceptional power of mental selfcontrol He took his perturbed mind now
and threw it forcibly into the consideration of a case upon which he had
reserved judgment He was to catch the  at Paddington and at two he
was smoking a cigar after a temperate lunch and reading over the notes
of this judgment It was then that the telephone bell became audible
and Candler came in to inform him that Lord Chickney was anxious to see
him at once upon a matter of some slight importance

Slight importance asked Lord Moggeridge

Some slight importance my lord

Some Slight

Is Lordship my lord mumbles rather now is back teeth ave gone
said Candler but so I understand im

These apologetic assertive phrases annoy me Candler said Lord
Moggeridge over his shoulder You see he turned round and spoke very
clearly either the matter is of importance or it is not of importance
A thing must either be or not be I wish you would managewhen you get
messages on the telephone But I suppose that is asking too much
Will you explain to him Candler when we start andask him
Candlerask him what sort of matter it is

Candler returned after some parleying

So far as I can make is Lordship out my lord e says e wants to set
you right about something my lord He says something about a little
misapprehension

These diminutives Candler kill sense Does he say what sortwhat
sortof little misapprehension

He says somethingIm sorry my lord but its about Shonts me lord

Then I dont want to hear about it said Lord Moggeridge

There was a pause The Lord Chancellor resumed his reading with a
deliberate obviousness the butler hovered

Im sorry my lord but I cant think exactly what I ought to say to
is lordship my lord

Tell himtell him that I do not wish to hear anything more about Shonts
for ever Simply

Candler hesitated and went out shutting the door carefully lest any
fragment of his halting rendering of this message to Lord Chickney
should reach his masters ears

Lord Moggeridges powers of mental control were I say very greatHe
could dismiss subjects from his mind absolutely In a few instants he
had completely forgotten Shonts and was making notes with a silvercased
pencil on the margins of his draft judgment


                                   

He became aware that Candler had returned

Is lordship Lord Chickney my lord is very persistent my lord Es
rung up twice E says now that e makes a personal matter of it Come
what may e says e wishes to speak for two minutes to your lordship
Over the telephone my lord e vouchsafes no further information

Lord Moggeridge meditated over the end of his third after lunch cigar
His man watched the end of his left eyebrow as an engineer might watch a
steam gauge There were no signs of an explosion He must come
Candler his lordship said at last

Oh Candler

My lord

Put the bags and things in a conspicuous position in the hall Candler
Change yourself and see that you look thoroughly like trains And in
fact have everything ready prominently ready Candler

Then once more Lord Moggeridge concentrated his mind


                                   

To him there presently entered Lord Chickney

Lord Chickney had been twice round the world and he had seen many
strange and dusky peoples and many remarkable customs and peculiar
prejudices which he had never failed to despise but he had never
completely shaken off the county family ideas in which he had been
brought up He believed that there was an incurable difference in spirit
between quite good people like himself and men from down below like
Moggeridge who was the son of an Exeter chorister He believed that
these men from nowhere always cherished the profoundest respect for the
real thing like himself that they were greedy for association and
gratified by notice and so for the life of him he could not approach
Lord Moggeridge without a faint sense of condescension He saluted him
as my dear Lord Moggeridge wrung his hand with effusion and asked
him kind almost districtvisiting questions about his younger brother
and the aspect of his house And you are just off I see for a
weekend

These amenities the Lord Chancellor acknowledged by faint gruntings and
an almost imperceptible movement of his eyebrows There was a matter
he said some little matter on which you want to consult me

Well said Lord Chickney and rubbed his chin Yes Yes there
was a little matter a little trouble

Of an urgent nature

Yes Yes Exactly Just a little complicated you know not quite
simple The dear old soldiers manner became almost seductive One of
these difficult little affairs where one has to remember that one is a
man of the world you know A little complication about a lady known to
you both But one must make concessions one must understand The boy
has a witness Things are not as you supposed them to be

Lord Moggeridge had a clean conscience about ladies he drew out his
watch and looked at itaggressively He kept it in his hand during his
subsequent remarks

I must confess he declared I have not the remotest idea If you
will be so good as to beelementary What is it all about

You see I knew the lads mother said Lord Chickney In fact He
became insanely confidentialUnder happier circumstancesdont
misunderstand me Moggeridge I mean no evilbut he might have been my
son I feel for him like a son


                                   

When presently Captain Douglas a little heated from his engine trouble
came into the roomhe had left Bealby with Candler in the hallit was
instantly manifest to him that the work of preparation had been
inadequately performed

One minute more my dear Alan cried Lord Chickney

Lord Moggeridge with eyebrows waving and watch in hand was of a
different opinion He addressed himself to Captain Douglas

There isnt a minute more he said What is all thisthis
philoprogenitive rigmarole about Why have you come to me My cab is
outside now All this about ladies and witnesseswhat is it

Perfectly simple my lord You imagine that I played practical jokes
upon you at Shonts I didnt I have a witness The attack upon you
downstairs the noise in your room

Have I any guarantee

Its the stewards boy from Shonts Your man outside knows him Saw him
in the stewards room He made the trouble for youand me and then he
ran away Just caught him Not exchanged thirty words with him Half a
dozen questions Settle everything Then youll knownothing for you but
the utmost respect

Lord Moggeridge pressed his lips together and resisted conviction

In consideration interpolated Lord Chickney feelings of an old
fellow Old soldier Boy means no harm

With the rudeness of one sorely tried the Lord Chancellor thrust the old
general aside Oh he said Oh and then to Captain Douglas One
minute Wheres your witness

The Captain opened a door Bealby found himself bundled into the
presence of two celebrated men

Tell him said Captain Douglas And look sharp about it

Tell me plainly cried the Lord Chancellor and bequick

He put such a point on quick that it made Bealby jump

Tell him said the general more gently Dont be afraid

Well began Bealby after one accumulating pause it was im told me
to do it E said you go in there

The Captain would have interrupted but the Lord Chancellor restrained
him by a magnificent gesture of the hand holding the watch

He told you to do it he said I knew he did Now listen He told you
practically to go in and do anything you could

Yessir Woe took possession of Bealby I didnt do any arm to the
ole gentleman

But who told you cried the Captain Who told you

Lord Moggeridge annihilated him with arm and eyebrows He held Bealby
fascinated by a pointing finger

Dont do more than answer the questions I have thirty seconds more He
told you to go in He made you go in At the earliest possible
opportunity you got away

I jest nipped out

Enough And now sir how dare you come here without even a plausible
lie How dare you after your intolerable tomfoolery at Shonts confront
me again with fresh tomfoolery How dare you drag in your gallant and
venerable uncle in this last preposterousI suppose you would call
itlark I suppose you had prepared that little wretch with some fine
story Little you know of False Witness At the first question he
breaks down He does not even begin his lie He at least knows the
difference between my standards and yours Candler Candler

Candler appeared

Thesethese gentlemen are going Is everything ready

The cab is at the door mlord The usual cab

Captain Douglas made one last desperate effort Sir he said My
lord

The Lord Chancellor turned upon him with a face that he sought to keep
calm though the eyebrows waved and streamed like black smoke in a gale
Captain Douglas he said you are probably not aware of the demands
upon the time and patience of a public servant in such a position as
mine You see the world no doubt as a vastly entertaining fabric upon
which you can embroider youryour facetious arrangements Well it is
not so It is real It is earnest You may sneer at the simplicity of an
old man but what I tell you of life is true Comic effect is not
believe me its goal And you sir you sir you impress me as an
intolerably foolish flippant and unnecessary young man Flippant
Unnecessary Foolish

As he said these words Candler approached him with a dust coat of a
peculiar fineness and dignity and he uttered the last words over his
protruded chest while Candler assisted his arms into his sleeves

My lord said Captain Douglas again but his resolution was deserting
him

No said the Lord Chancellor leaning forward in a minatory manner
while Candler pulled down the tail of his jacket and adjusted the collar
of his overcoat

Uncle said Captain Douglas

No said the general with the curt decision of a soldier and
turned exactly ninety degrees away from him You little know how you
have hurt me Alan You little know I couldnt have imagined it The
Douglas strain False Witnessand insult I am sorry my dear
Moggeridge beyond measure

I quite understandyou are as much a victim as myself Quite A more
foolish attemptI am sorry to be in this hurry

Oh You damned little fool said the Captain and advanced a step
towards the perplexed and shrinking Bealby You imbecile little
trickster What do you mean by it

I didnt mean anything

Then suddenly the thought of Madeleine sweet and overpowering came
into the head of this distraught young man He had risked losing her he
had slighted and insulted her and here he wasentangled Here he was in
a position of nearly inconceivable foolishness about to assault a dirty
and silly little boy in the presence of the Lord Chancellor and Uncle
Chickney The world he felt was lost and not well lost And she was
lost too Even now while he pursued these follies she might be consoling
her wounded pride

He perceived that love is the supreme thing in life He perceived that
he who divides his purposes scatters his life to the four winds of
heaven A vehement resolve to cut the whole of this Bealby business
pounced upon him In that moment he ceased to care for reputation for
appearances for the resentment of Lord Moggeridge or the good
intentions of Uncle Chickney

He turned he rushed out of the room He escaped by unparalleled
gymnastics the worst consequences of an encounter with the Lord
Chancellors bag which the underbutler had placed rather tactlessly
between the doors crossed the wide and dignified hall and in another
moment had his engine going and was struggling to mount his machine in
the street without His face expressed an almost apoplectic
concentration He narrowly missed the noses of a pair of horses in the
carriage of Lady Beach Mandarin made an extraordinary curve to spare a
fishmongers tricycle shaved the front and completely destroyed the
gesture of that eminent actor manager Mr Pomegranate who was crossing
the road in his usual inadvertent fashion and then he was popping and
throbbing and banging round the corner and on his way back to the lovely
and irresistible woman who was exerting so disastrous an influence upon
his career


                                   

The Captain fled from London in the utmost fury and to the general
danger of the public His heart was full of wicked blasphemies
shoutings and selfreproaches but outwardly he seemed only pinkly
intent And as he crossed an open breezy common and passed by a
milestone bearing this inscription To London Thirteen Miles his hind
tyre burst conclusively with a massive report


                                   

In every life there are crucial moments turning points and not
infrequently it is just such a thing as this a report a sudden waking
in the night a flash upon the road to Damascus that marks and
precipitates the accumulating new Vehemence is not concentration The
headlong violence of the Captain had been no expression of a
singleminded purpose of a soul all gathered together to an end Far
less a pursuit had it been than a flight a flight from his own
dissensions And nownow he was held

After he had attempted a few plausible repairs and found the tyre
obdurate after he had addressed illchosen remonstrances to some
unnamed hearer after he had walked some way along the road and back in
an indecision about repair shops in some neighbouring town the last
dregs of his resistance were spent He perceived that he was in the
presence of a Lesson He sat down by the roadside some twenty feet from
the disabled motor bicycle and impotent for further effort frankly
admitted himself overtaken He had not reckoned with punctures

The pursuing questions came clambering upon him and would no longer be
denied who he was and what he was and how he was and the meaning of
this Rare Bate he had been in and all those deep questions that are so
systematically neglected in the haste and excitement of modern life

In short for the first time in many headlong days he asked himself
simply and plainly what he thought he was up to

Certain things became clear and so minutely and exactly clear that it
was incredible that they had ever for a moment been obscure Of course
Bealby had been a perfectly honest little boy under some sort of
misconception and of course he ought to have been carefully coached and
prepared and rehearsed before he was put before the Lord Chancellor
This was so manifest now that the Captain stared aghast at his own
inconceivable negligence But the mischief was done Nothing now would
ever propitiate Moggeridge nothing now would ever reconcile Uncle
Chickney That wassettled But what was not settled was the amazing
disorder of his own mind Why had he been so negligent what had come
over his mind in the last few weeks

And this sudden strange illumination of the Captains mind went so far
as perceiving that the really important concern for him was not the
accidents of Shonts but this epilepsy of his own will Why now was he
rushing back to Madeleine Why He did not love her He knew he did not
love her On the whole more than anything else he resented her

But he was excited about her he was so excited that these other
muddles fluctuations follies came as a natural consequence from that
Out of this excitement came those wild floods of angry energy that made
him career about

Like some damned Cracker said the Captain

For instance he asked himself now what am I going for

If I go back shell probably behave like an offended Queen Doesnt
seem to understand anything that does not focus on herself Wants a sort
of Limelight Lover

She relies upon exciting me

She relies upon exciting everyoneshes just a woman specialized for
excitement

And after meditating through a profound minute upon this judgment the
Captain pronounced these two epochmaking words I wont


                                   

The Captains mind was now in a state of almost violent lucidity

This sex stuff he said first I kept it under too tight and now Ive
let it rip too loose

Ive been just a distracted fool with my head swimming with meetings
and embraces andfrills

He produced some long impending generalizations

Not a mans work this Lover business Dancing about in a world of
petticoats and powder puffs and attentions and jealousies Rotten game
Played off against some other man

Ill be hanged if I am

Have to put women in their places

Make a hash of everything if we dont

Then for a time the Captain meditated in silence and chewed his knuckle
His face darkened to a scowl He swore as though some thought twisted
and tormented him Let some other man get her Think of her with some
other man

I dont care he said when obviously he did

Theres other women in the world

A mana man mustnt care for that

Its this or that said the Captain anyhow


                                   

Suddenly the Captains mind was made up and done

He arose to his feet and his face was firm and tranquil and now nearer
pallor than pink He left his bicycle and trailer by the wayside even as
Christian left his burden He asked a passing nursegirl the way to the
nearest railway station and thither he went Incidentally and because
the opportunity offered he called in upon a cyclists repair shop and
committed his abandoned machinery to its keeping He went straight to
London changed at his flat dined at his club and caught the night
train for Francefor France and whatever was left of the grand
manuvres

He wrote a letter to Madeleine from the Est train next day using their
customary endearments avoiding any discussion of their relations and
describing the scenery of the Seine valley and the characteristics of
Rouen in a few vivid and masterly phrases

If shes worth having shell understand said the Captain but he
knew perfectly well she would not understand

Mrs Geedge noted this letter among the others and afterwards she was
much exercised by Madeleines behaviour For suddenly that lady became
extraordinarily gay and joyous in her bearing singing snatches of song
and bubbling over with suggestions for larks and picnics and wild
excursions She patted Mr Geedge on the shoulder and ran her arm
through the arm of Professor Bowles Both gentlemen received these
familiarities with a gawky coyness that Mrs Geedge found contemptible
And moreover Madeleine drew several shy strangers into their circle She
invited the management to a happy participation

Her great idea was a moonlight picnic Well have a great campfire and
afterwards well dancethis very night

But wouldnt it be better tomorrow

Tonight

Tomorrow perhaps Captain Douglas may be back again And hes so good
at all these things

Mrs Geedge knew better because she had seen the French stamp on the
letter but she meant to get to the bottom of this business and thus it
was she said this

Ive sent him back to his soldiering said Madeleine serenely He has
better things to do


                                   

For some moments after the unceremonious departure of Captain Douglas
from the presence of Lord Moggeridge it did not occur to anyone it did
not occur even to Bealby that the Captain had left his witness behind
him The general and the Lord Chancellor moved into the hall and
Bealby under the sway of a swift compelling gesture from Candler
followed modestly The same current swept them all out into the portico
and while the underbutler whistled up a hansom for the General the
Lord Chancellor with a dignity that was at once polite and rapid and
Candler gravely protective and little reproving departed Bealby
slowly apprehending their desertion regarded the world of London with
perplexity and dismay Candler had gone The last of the gentlemen was
going The underbutler Bealby felt was no friend Underbutlers never
are

Lord Chickney in the very act of entering his cab had his coattail
tugged He looked enquiringly

Please sir theres me said Bealby

Lord Chickney reflected Well he said

The spirit of Bealby was now greatly abased His face and voice betrayed
him on the verge of tears I want to go ome to Shonts sir

Well my boy go omego home I mean to Shonts

Es gone sir said Bealby

Lord Chickney was a goodhearted man and he knew that a certain public
kindliness and disregard of appearances looks far better and is
infinitely more popular than a punctilious dignity He took Bealby to
Waterloo in his hansom got him a third class ticket to Chelsome tipped
a porter to see him safely into his train and dismissed him in the most
fatherly manner


                                   

It was well after teatime Bealby felt as he came once more within the
boundaries of the Shonts estate

It was a wiser and a graver Bealby who returned from this week of
miscellaneous adventure He did not clearly understand all that had
happened to him in particular he was puzzled by the extreme annoyance
and sudden departure of Captain Douglas from the presence of Lord
Moggeridge but his general impression was that he had been in great
peril of dire punishment and that he had been rather hastily and
ignominiously reprieved The nice old gentleman with the long grey
moustaches had dismissed him to the train at last with a quality of
benediction But Bealby understood now better than he had done before
that adventures do not always turn out well for the boy hero and that
the social system has a number of dangerous and disagreeable holes at
the bottom He had reached the beginnings of wisdom He was glad he had
got away from the tramp and still gladder that he had got away from
Crayminster he was sorry that he would never see the beautiful lady
again and perplexed and perplexed And also he was interested in the
probability of his mother having toast for tea

It must he felt be a long time after teatime quite late

He had weighed the advisability of returning quietly to his windowless
bedroom under the stairs putting on his little green apron and emerging
with a dutiful sangfroid as if nothing had happened on the one hand
or of going to the gardens on the other But teawith eatablesseemed
more probable at the gardens

He was deflected from the direct route across the park by a long deep
trench that someone had made and abandoned since the previous Sunday
morning He wondered what it was for It was certainly very ugly And as
he came out by the trees and got the full effect of the faade he
detected a strangely bandaged quality about Shonts It was as if Shonts
had recently been in a fight and got a black eye Then he saw the reason
for this one tower was swathed in scaffolding He wondered what could
have happened to the tower Then his own troubles resumed their sway

He was so fortunate as not to meet his father in the gardens and he
entered the house so meekly that his mother did not look up from the
cashmere she was sewing She was sitting at the table sewing some newly
dyed black cashmere

He was astonished at her extreme pallor and the drooping resignation of
her pose

Mother he said and she looked up convulsively and stared stared
with bright round astonished eyes

Im sorry mother Iavent been quite a good stewardsroom boy
mother If I could ave another go mother

He halted for a moment astonished that she said nothing but only sat
with that strange expression and opened and shut her mouth

ReelyId try mother
