                              By

                      Nathaniel Hawthorne



Hearken to our neighbor with the iron tongue  While I sit musing over my
sheet of foolscap he emphatically tells the hour in tones loud enough
for all the town to hear though doubtless intended only as a gentle hint
to myself that I may begin his biography before the evening shall be
further wasted  Unquestionably a personage in such an elevated
position and making so great a noise in the world has a fair claim to
the services of a biographer  He is the representative and most
illustrious member of that innumerable class whose characteristic
feature is the tongue and whose sole business to clamor for the public
good  If any of his noisy brethren in our tonguegoverned democracy be
envious of the superiority which I have assigned him they have my free
consent to hang themselves as high as he  And for his history let not
the reader apprehend an empty repetition of dingdongbell
He has been the passive hero of wonderful vicissitudes with which I have
chanced to become acquainted possibly from his own mouth while the
careless multitude supposed him to be talking merely of the time of day
or calling them to dinner or to church or bidding drowsy people go
bedward or the dead to their graves  Many a revolution has it been his
fate to go through and invariably with a prodigious uproar  And whether
or no he have told me his reminiscences this at least is true that the
more I study his deeptoned language the more sense and sentiment and
soul do I discover in it

This bellfor we may as well drop our quaint personificationis of
antique French manufacture and the symbol of the cross betokens that it
was meant to be suspended in the belfry of a Romish place of worship
The old people hereabout have a tradition that a considerable part of
the metal was supplied by a brass cannon captured in one of the
victories of Louis the Fourteenth over the Spaniards and that a Bourbon
princess threw her golden crucifix into the molten mass  It is said
likewise that a bishop baptized and blessed the bell and prayed that a
heavenly influence might mingle with its tones  When all due ceremonies
had been performed the Grand Monarque bestowed the giftthan which none
could resound his beneficence more loudlyon the Jesuits who were then
converting the American Indians to the spiritual dominion of the Pope
So the bellour selfsame bell whose familiar voice we may hear at all
hours in the streetsthis very bell sent forth its firstborn accents
from the tower of a logbuilt chapel westward of Lake Champlain and
near the mighty stream of the St Lawrence  It was called Our Ladys
Chapel of the Forest  The peal went forth as if to redeem and consecrate
the heathen wilderness  The wolf growled at the sound as he prowled
stealthily through the underbrush the grim bear turned his back and
stalked sullenly away the startled doe leaped up and led her fawn into
a deeper solitude  The red men wondered what awful voice was speaking
amid the wind that roared through the treetops and following
reverentially its summons the darkrobed fathers blessed them as they
drew near the crosscrowned chapel  In a little time there was a
crucifix on every dusky bosom  The Indians knelt beneath the lowly roof
worshipping in the same forms that were observed under the vast dome of
St Peters when the Pope performed high mass in the presence of
kneeling princes  All the religious festivals that awoke the chiming
bells of lofty cathedrals called forth a peal from Our Ladys Chapel of
the Forest  Loudly rang the bell of the wilderness while the streets of
Paris echoed with rejoicings for the birthday of the Bourbon or whenever
France had triumphed on some European battlefield  And the solemn woods
were saddened with a melancholy knell as often as the thickstrewn leaves
were swept away from the virgin soil for the burial of an Indian chief

Meantime the bells of a hostile people and a hostile faith were ringing
on Sabbaths and lecturedays at Boston and other Puritan towns  Their
echoes died away hundreds of miles southeastward of Our Ladys Chapel
But scouts had threaded the pathless desert that lay between and from
behind the huge treetrunks perceived the Indians assembling at the
summons of the bell  Some bore flaxenhaired scalps at their girdles as
if to lay those bloody trophies on Our Ladys altar  It was reported
and believed all through New England that the Pope of Rome and the
King of France had established this little chapel in the forest for the
purpose of stirring up the red men to a crusade against the English
settlers  The latter took energetic measures to secure their religion
and their lives  On the eve of an especial fast of the Romish Church
while the bell tolled dismally and the priests were chanting a doleful
stave a band of New England rangers rushed from the surrounding woods
Fierce shouts and the report of musketry pealed suddenly within the
chapel  The ministering priests threw themselves before the altar and
were slain even on its steps  If as antique traditions tell us no
grass will grow where the blood of martyrs has been shed there should be
a barren spot to this very day on the site of that desecrated altar

While the blood was still plashing from step to step the leader of the
rangers seized a torch and applied it to the drapery of the shrine  The
flame and smoke arose as from a burntsacrifice at once illuminating
and obscuring the whole interior of the chapelnow hiding the dead
priests in a sable shroud now revealing them and their slayers in one
terrific glare  Some already wished that the altarsmoke could cover the
deed from the sight of Heaven  But one of the rangersa man of
sanctified aspect though his hands were bloodyapproached the captain

Sir said he our village meetinghouse lacks a bell and hitherto we
have been fain to summon the good people to worship by beat of drum
Give me I pray you the bell of this popish chapel for the sake of the
godly Mr Rogers who doubtless hath remembered us in the prayers of the
congregation ever since we began our march  Who can tell what share of
this nights good success we owe to that holy mans wrestling with the
Lord

Nay then answered the captain if good Mr Rogers hath holpen our
enterprise it is right that he should share the spoil  Take the bell
and welcome Deacon Lawson if you will be at the trouble of carrying it
home  Hitherto it hath spoken nothing but papistry and that too in the
French or Indian gibberish but I warrant me if Mr Rogers consecrate it
anew it will talk like a good English and Protestant bell

So Deacon Lawson and half a score of his townsmen took down the bell
suspended it on a pole and bore it away on their sturdy shoulders
meaning to carry it to the shore of Lake Champlain and thence homeward
by water  Far through the woods gleamed the flames of Our Ladys Chapel
flinging fantastic shadows from the clustered foliage and glancing on
brooks that had never caught the sunlight  As the rangers traversed the
midnight forest staggering under their heavy burden the tongue of the
bell gave many a tremendous strokeclang clang clanga most
doleful sound as if it were tolling for the slaughter of the priests and
the ruin of the chapel  Little dreamed Deacon Lawson and his townsmen
that it was their own funeral knell  A warparty of Indians had heard
the report of musketry and seen the blaze of the chapel and now were
on the track of the rangers summoned to vengeance by the bells dismal
murmurs  In the midst of a deep swamp they made a sudden onset on the
retreating foe  Good Deacon Lawson battled stoutly but had his skull
cloven by a tomahawk and sank into the depths of the morass with the
ponderous bell above him  And for many a year thereafter our heros
voice was heard no more on earth neither at the hour of worship nor at
festivals nor funerals

And is he still buried in that unknown grave  Scarcely so dear reader
Hark  How plainly we hear him at this moment the spokesman of Time
proclaiming that it is nine oclock at night  We may therefore safely
conclude that some happy chance has restored him to upper air

But there lay the bell for many silent years and the wonder is that he
did not lie silent there a century or perhaps a dozen centuries till
the world should have forgotten not only his voice but the voices of the
whole brotherhood of bells  How would the first accent of his iron
tongue have startled his resurrectionists  But he was not fated to be a
subject of discussion among the antiquaries of far posterity  Near the
close of the Old French War a party of New England axemen who preceded
the march of Colonel Bradstreet toward Lake Ontario were building a
bridge of logs through a swamp  Plunging down a stake one of these
pioneers felt it graze against some hard smooth substance  He called
his comrades and by their united efforts the top of the bell was
raised to the surface a rope made fast to it and thence passed over the
horizontal limb of a tree  Heave ho up they hoisted their prize
dripping with moisture and festooned with verdant watermoss  As the
base of the bell emerged from the swamp the pioneers perceived that a
skeleton was clinging with its bony fingers to the clapper but
immediately relaxing its nerveless grasp sank back into the stagnant
water  The bell then gave forth a sullen clang  No wonder that he was
in haste to speak after holding his tongue for such a length of time
The pioneers shoved the bell to and fro thus ringing a loud and heavy
peal which echoed widely through the forest and reached the ears of
Colonel Bradstreet and his three thousand men  The soldiers paused on
their march a feeling of religion mingled with bornetenderness
overpowered their rude hearts each seemed to hear the clangor of the old
churchbell which had been familiar to hint from infancy and had tolled
at the funerals of all his forefathers  By what magic had that holy
sound strayed over the widemurmuring ocean and become audible amid the
clash of arms the loud crashing of the artillery over the rough
wildernesspath and the melancholy roar of the wind among the boughs

The NewEnglanders hid their prize in a shadowy nook betwixt a large
gray stone and the earthy roots of an overthrown tree and when the
campaign was ended they conveyed our friend to Boston and put him up at
auction on the sidewalk of King Street  He was suspended for the nonce
by a block and tackle and being swung backward and forward gave such
loud and clear testimony to his own merits that the auctioneer had no
need to say a word  The highest bidder was a rich old representative
from our town who piously bestowed the bell on the meetinghouse where
he had been a worshipper for half a century  The good man had his
reward  By a strange coincidence the very first duty of the sexton
after the bell had been hoisted into the belfry was to toll the funeral
knell of the donor  Soon however those doleful echoes were drowned by
a triumphant peal for the surrender of Quebec

Ever since that period our hero has occupied the same elevated station
and has put in his word on all matters of public importance civil
military or religious  On the day when Independence was first
proclaimed in the street beneath he uttered a peal which many deemed
ominous and fearful rather than triumphant  But he has told the same
story these sixty years and none mistake his meaning now  When
Washington in the fulness of his glory rode through our flowerstrewn
streets this was the tongue that bade the Father of his Country welcome
Again the same voice was heard when La Fayette came to gather in his
halfcenturys harvest of gratitude  Meantime vast changes have been
going on below  His voice which once floated over a little provincial
seaport is now reverberated between brick edifices and strikes the ear
amid the buzz and tumult of a city  On the Sabbaths of olden time the
summons of the bell was obeyed by a picturesque and varied throng
stately gentlemen in purple velvet coats embroidered waistcoats white
wigs and goldlaced hats stepping with grave courtesy beside ladies in
flowered satin gowns and hooppetticoats of majestic circumference
while behind followed a liveried slave or bondsman bearing the
psalmbook and a stove for his mistresss feet  The commonalty clad in
homely garb gave precedence to their betters at the door of the
meetinghouse as if admitting that there were distinctions between them
even in the sight of God  Yet as their coffins were borne one after
another through the street the bell has tolled a requiem for all alike
What mattered it whether or no there were a silver scutcheon on the
coffinlid  Open thy bosom Mother Earth  Thus spake the bell
Another of thy children is coming to his long rest  Take him to thy
bosom and let him slumber in peace Thus spake the bell and Mother
Earth received her child  With the selfsame tones will the present
generation be ushered to the embraces of their mother and Mother Earth
will still receive her children  Is not thy tongue aweary mournful
talker of two centuries  O funeral bell wilt thou never be shattered
with thine own melancholy strokes  Yea and a trumpetcall shall arouse
the sleepers whom thy heavy clang could awake no more

Againagain thy voice reminding me that I am wasting the midnight
oil  In my lonely fantasy I can scarce believe that other mortals have
caught the sound or that it vibrates elsewhere than in my secret soul
But to many hast thou spoken  Anxious men have heard thee on their
sleepless pillows and bethought themselves anew of tomorrows care  In
a brief interval of wakefulness the sons of toil have heard thee and
say Is so much of our quiet slumber spentis the morning so near at
hand  Crime has heard thee and mutters Now is the very hour
Despair answers thee Thus much of this weary life is gone The young
mother on her bed of pain and ecstasy has counted thy echoing strokes
and dates from them her firstborns share of life and immortality  The
bridegroom and the bride have listened and feel that their night of
rapture flits like a dream away  Thine accents have fallen faintly on
the ear of the dying man and warned him that ere thou speakest again
his spirit shall have passed whither no voice of time can ever reach
Alas for the departing traveller if thy voicethe voice of fleeting
timehave taught him no lessons for Eternity
