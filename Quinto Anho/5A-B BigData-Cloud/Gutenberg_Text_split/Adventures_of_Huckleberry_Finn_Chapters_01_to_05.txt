EXPLANATORY

IN this book a number of dialects are used to wit  the Missouri negro
dialect the extremest form of the backwoods Southwestern dialect the
ordinary Pike County dialect and four modified varieties of this last
The shadings have not been done in a haphazard fashion or by guesswork
but painstakingly and with the trustworthy guidance and support of
personal familiarity with these several forms of speech

I make this explanation for the reason that without it many readers would
suppose that all these characters were trying to talk alike and not
succeeding

HUCKLEBERRY FINN

Scene  The Mississippi Valley Time  Forty to fifty years ago



CHAPTER I

YOU dont know about me without you have read a book by the name of The
Adventures of Tom Sawyer but that aint no matter  That book was made
by Mr Mark Twain and he told the truth mainly  There was things which
he stretched but mainly he told the truth  That is nothing  I never
seen anybody but lied one time or another without it was Aunt Polly or
the widow or maybe Mary  Aunt PollyToms Aunt Polly she isand
Mary and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book which is
mostly a true book with some stretchers as I said before

Now the way that the book winds up is this  Tom and me found the money
that the robbers hid in the cave and it made us rich  We got six
thousand dollars apieceall gold  It was an awful sight of money when
it was piled up  Well Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out at
interest and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year round
more than a body could tell what to do with  The Widow Douglas she took
me for her son and allowed she would sivilize me but it was rough
living in the house all the time considering how dismal regular and
decent the widow was in all her ways and so when I couldnt stand it no
longer I lit out  I got into my old rags and my sugarhogshead again
and was free and satisfied  But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and said he
was going to start a band of robbers and I might join if I would go back
to the widow and be respectable  So I went back

The widow she cried over me and called me a poor lost lamb and she
called me a lot of other names too but she never meant no harm by it
She put me in them new clothes again and I couldnt do nothing but sweat
and sweat and feel all cramped up  Well then the old thing commenced
again  The widow rung a bell for supper and you had to come to time
When you got to the table you couldnt go right to eating but you had to
wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little over the
victuals though there warnt really anything the matter with themthat
is nothing only everything was cooked by itself  In a barrel of odds
and ends it is different things get mixed up and the juice kind of
swaps around and the things go better

After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the
Bulrushers and I was in a sweat to find out all about him but by and by
she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time so then
I didnt care no more about him because I dont take no stock in dead
people

Pretty soon I wanted to smoke and asked the widow to let me  But she
wouldnt  She said it was a mean practice and wasnt clean and I must
try to not do it any more  That is just the way with some people  They
get down on a thing when they dont know nothing about it  Here she was
abothering about Moses which was no kin to her and no use to anybody
being gone you see yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a
thing that had some good in it  And she took snuff too of course that
was all right because she done it herself

Her sister Miss Watson a tolerable slim old maid with goggles on
had just come to live with her and took a set at me now with a
spellingbook She worked me middling hard for about an hour and then
the widow made her ease up  I couldnt stood it much longer  Then for
an hour it was deadly dull and I was fidgety  Miss Watson would say
Dont put your feet up there Huckleberry and Dont scrunch up like
that Huckleberryset up straight and pretty soon she would say
Dont gap and stretch like that Huckleberrywhy dont you try to
behave  Then she told me all about the bad place and I said I wished I
was there She got mad then but I didnt mean no harm  All I wanted was
to go somewheres all I wanted was a change I warnt particular  She
said it was wicked to say what I said said she wouldnt say it for the
whole world she was going to live so as to go to the good place  Well
I couldnt see no advantage in going where she was going so I made up my
mind I wouldnt try for it  But I never said so because it would only
make trouble and wouldnt do no good

Now she had got a start and she went on and told me all about the good
place  She said all a body would have to do there was to go around all
day long with a harp and sing forever and ever  So I didnt think much
of it But I never said so  I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer would
go there and she said not by a considerable sight  I was glad about
that because I wanted him and me to be together

Miss Watson she kept pecking at me and it got tiresome and lonesome  By
and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers and then everybody
was off to bed  I went up to my room with a piece of candle and put it
on the table  Then I set down in a chair by the window and tried to
think of something cheerful but it warnt no use  I felt so lonesome I
most wished I was dead  The stars were shining and the leaves rustled
in the woods ever so mournful and I heard an owl away off whowhooing
about somebody that was dead and a whippowill and a dog crying about
somebody that was going to die and the wind was trying to whisper
something to me and I couldnt make out what it was and so it made the
cold shivers run over me Then away out in the woods I heard that kind of
a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about something thats
on its mind and cant make itself understood and so cant rest easy in
its grave and has to go about that way every night grieving  I got so
downhearted and scared I did wish I had some company  Pretty soon a
spider went crawling up my shoulder and I flipped it off and it lit in
the candle and before I could budge it was all shriveled up  I didnt
need anybody to tell me that that was an awful bad sign and would fetch
me some bad luck so I was scared and most shook the clothes off of me
I got up and turned around in my tracks three times and crossed my breast
every time and then I tied up a little lock of my hair with a thread to
keep witches away  But I hadnt no confidence  You do that when youve
lost a horseshoe that youve found instead of nailing it up over the
door but I hadnt ever heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad
luck when youd killed a spider

I set down again ashaking all over and got out my pipe for a smoke
for the house was all as still as death now and so the widow wouldnt
know Well after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town go
boomboomboomtwelve licks and all still againstiller than ever
Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the trees
something was a stirring  I set still and listened  Directly I could
just barely hear a meyow meyow down there  That was good  Says I
meyow meyow as soft as I could and then I put out the light and
scrambled out of the window on to the shed  Then I slipped down to the
ground and crawled in among the trees and sure enough there was Tom
Sawyer waiting for me




CHAPTER II

WE went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of
the widows garden stooping down so as the branches wouldnt scrape our
heads When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made a
noise  We scrouched down and laid still  Miss Watsons big nigger
named Jim was setting in the kitchen door we could see him pretty
clear because there was a light behind him  He got up and stretched his
neck out about a minute listening  Then he says

Who dah

He listened some more then he come tiptoeing down and stood right
between us we could a touched him nearly  Well likely it was minutes
and minutes that there warnt a sound and we all there so close
together  There was a place on my ankle that got to itching but I
dasnt scratch it and then my ear begun to itch and next my back right
between my shoulders  Seemed like Id die if I couldnt scratch  Well
Ive noticed that thing plenty times since  If you are with the quality
or at a funeral or trying to go to sleep when you aint sleepyif you
are anywheres where it wont do for you to scratch why you will itch all
over in upwards of a thousand places Pretty soon Jim says

Say who is you  Whar is you  Dog my cats ef I didn hear sumfn
Well I know what Is gwyne to do  Is gwyne to set down here and listen
tell I hears it agin

So he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom  He leaned his back up
against a tree and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched
one of mine  My nose begun to itch  It itched till the tears come into
my eyes  But I dasnt scratch  Then it begun to itch on the inside
Next I got to itching underneath  I didnt know how I was going to set
still This miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes but it
seemed a sight longer than that  I was itching in eleven different
places now  I reckoned I couldnt stand it moren a minute longer but I
set my teeth hard and got ready to try  Just then Jim begun to breathe
heavy next he begun to snoreand then I was pretty soon comfortable
again

Tom he made a sign to mekind of a little noise with his mouthand we
went creeping away on our hands and knees  When we was ten foot off Tom
whispered to me and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun  But I said
no he might wake and make a disturbance and then theyd find out I
warnt in Then Tom said he hadnt got candles enough and he would slip
in the kitchen and get some more  I didnt want him to try  I said Jim
might wake up and come  But Tom wanted to resk it so we slid in there
and got three candles and Tom laid five cents on the table for pay
Then we got out and I was in a sweat to get away but nothing would do
Tom but he must crawl to where Jim was on his hands and knees and play
something on him  I waited and it seemed a good while everything was
so still and lonesome

As soon as Tom was back we cut along the path around the garden fence
and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of
the house  Tom said he slipped Jims hat off of his head and hung it on
a limb right over him and Jim stirred a little but he didnt wake
Afterwards Jim said the witches be witched him and put him in a trance
and rode him all over the State and then set him under the trees again
and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it  And next time Jim told
it he said they rode him down to New Orleans and after that every time
he told it he spread it more and more till by and by he said they rode
him all over the world and tired him most to death and his back was all
over saddleboils  Jim was monstrous proud about it and he got so he
wouldnt hardly notice the other niggers  Niggers would come miles to
hear Jim tell about it and he was more looked up to than any nigger in
that country  Strange niggers would stand with their mouths open and
look him all over same as if he was a wonder  Niggers is always talking
about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire but whenever one was
talking and letting on to know all about such things Jim would happen in
and say Hm  What you know bout witches and that nigger was corked
up and had to take a back seat  Jim always kept that fivecenter piece
round his neck with a string and said it was a charm the devil give to
him with his own hands and told him he could cure anybody with it and
fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by saying something to it but
he never told what it was he said to it  Niggers would come from all
around there and give Jim anything they had just for a sight of that
fivecenter piece but they wouldnt touch it because the devil had had
his hands on it  Jim was most ruined for a servant because he got stuck
up on account of having seen the devil and been rode by witches

Well when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down
into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling where
there was sick folks maybe and the stars over us was sparkling ever so
fine and down by the village was the river a whole mile broad and
awful still and grand  We went down the hill and found Jo Harper and Ben
Rogers and two or three more of the boys hid in the old tanyard  So we
unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half to the
big scar on the hillside and went ashore

We went to a clump of bushes and Tom made everybody swear to keep the
secret and then showed them a hole in the hill right in the thickest
part of the bushes  Then we lit the candles and crawled in on our hands
and knees  We went about two hundred yards and then the cave opened up
Tom poked about amongst the passages and pretty soon ducked under a wall
where you wouldnt a noticed that there was a hole  We went along a
narrow place and got into a kind of room all damp and sweaty and cold
and there we stopped  Tom says

Now well start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyers Gang
Everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath and write his name
in blood

Everybody was willing  So Tom got out a sheet of paper that he had wrote
the oath on and read it  It swore every boy to stick to the band and
never tell any of the secrets and if anybody done anything to any boy in
the band whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and his family
must do it and he mustnt eat and he mustnt sleep till he had killed
them and hacked a cross in their breasts which was the sign of the band
And nobody that didnt belong to the band could use that mark and if he
did he must be sued and if he done it again he must be killed  And if
anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets he must have his
throat cut and then have his carcass burnt up and the ashes scattered
all around and his name blotted off of the list with blood and never
mentioned again by the gang but have a curse put on it and be forgot
forever

Everybody said it was a real beautiful oath and asked Tom if he got it
out of his own head  He said some of it but the rest was out of
piratebooks and robberbooks and every gang that was hightoned had it

Some thought it would be good to kill the FAMILIES of boys that told the
secrets  Tom said it was a good idea so he took a pencil and wrote it
in Then Ben Rogers says

Heres Huck Finn he haint got no family what you going to do bout
him

Well haint he got a father says Tom Sawyer

Yes hes got a father but you cant never find him these days  He
used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard but he haint been seen
in these parts for a year or more

They talked it over and they was going to rule me out because they said
every boy must have a family or somebody to kill or else it wouldnt be
fair and square for the others  Well nobody could think of anything to
doeverybody was stumped and set still  I was most ready to cry but
all at once I thought of a way and so I offered them Miss Watsonthey
could kill her  Everybody said

Oh shell do  Thats all right  Huck can come in

Then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with and
I made my mark on the paper

Now says Ben Rogers whats the line of business of this Gang

Nothing only robbery and murder Tom said

But who are we going to robhouses or cattle or

Stuff stealing cattle and such things aint robbery its burglary
says Tom Sawyer  We aint burglars  That aint no sort of style  We
are highwaymen  We stop stages and carriages on the road with masks on
and kill the people and take their watches and money

Must we always kill the people

Oh certainly  Its best  Some authorities think different but mostly
its considered best to kill themexcept some that you bring to the cave
here and keep them till theyre ransomed

Ransomed  Whats that

I dont know  But thats what they do  Ive seen it in books and so
of course thats what weve got to do

But how can we do it if we dont know what it is

Why blame it all weve GOT to do it  Dont I tell you its in the
books  Do you want to go to doing different from whats in the books
and get things all muddled up

Oh thats all very fine to SAY Tom Sawyer but how in the nation are
these fellows going to be ransomed if we dont know how to do it to them
thats the thing I want to get at  Now what do you reckon it is

Well I dont know  But peraps if we keep them till theyre ransomed
it means that we keep them till theyre dead

Now thats something LIKE  Thatll answer  Why couldnt you said that
before  Well keep them till theyre ransomed to death and a bothersome
lot theyll be tooeating up everything and always trying to get
loose

How you talk Ben Rogers  How can they get loose when theres a guard
over them ready to shoot them down if they move a peg

A guard  Well that IS good  So somebodys got to set up all night and
never get any sleep just so as to watch them  I think thats
foolishness Why cant a body take a club and ransom them as soon as they
get here

Because it aint in the books sothats why  Now Ben Rogers do you
want to do things regular or dont youthats the idea  Dont you
reckon that the people that made the books knows whats the correct thing
to do  Do you reckon YOU can learn em anything  Not by a good deal
No sir well just go on and ransom them in the regular way

All right  I dont mind but I say its a fool way anyhow  Say do we
kill the women too

Well Ben Rogers if I was as ignorant as you I wouldnt let on  Kill
the women  No nobody ever saw anything in the books like that  You
fetch them to the cave and youre always as polite as pie to them and
by and by they fall in love with you and never want to go home any
more

Well if thats the way Im agreed but I dont take no stock in it
Mighty soon well have the cave so cluttered up with women and fellows
waiting to be ransomed that there wont be no place for the robbers
But go ahead I aint got nothing to say

Little Tommy Barnes was asleep now and when they waked him up he was
scared and cried and said he wanted to go home to his ma and didnt
want to be a robber any more

So they all made fun of him and called him crybaby and that made him
mad and he said he would go straight and tell all the secrets  But Tom
give him five cents to keep quiet and said we would all go home and meet
next week and rob somebody and kill some people

Ben Rogers said he couldnt get out much only Sundays and so he wanted
to begin next Sunday but all the boys said it would be wicked to do it
on Sunday and that settled the thing  They agreed to get together and
fix a day as soon as they could and then we elected Tom Sawyer first
captain and Jo Harper second captain of the Gang and so started home

I clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was
breaking My new clothes was all greased up and clayey and I was
dogtired




CHAPTER III

WELL I got a good goingover in the morning from old Miss Watson on
account of my clothes but the widow she didnt scold but only cleaned
off the grease and clay and looked so sorry that I thought I would
behave awhile if I could  Then Miss Watson she took me in the closet and
prayed but nothing come of it  She told me to pray every day and
whatever I asked for I would get it  But it warnt so  I tried it
Once I got a fishline but no hooks  It warnt any good to me without
hooks  I tried for the hooks three or four times but somehow I couldnt
make it work  By and by one day I asked Miss Watson to try for me but
she said I was a fool  She never told me why and I couldnt make it out
no way

I set down one time back in the woods and had a long think about it  I
says to myself if a body can get anything they pray for why dont
Deacon Winn get back the money he lost on pork  Why cant the widow get
back her silver snuffbox that was stole  Why cant Miss Watson fat up
No says I to my self there aint nothing in it  I went and told the
widow about it and she said the thing a body could get by praying for it
was spiritual gifts  This was too many for me but she told me what
she meantI must help other people and do everything I could for other
people and look out for them all the time and never think about myself
This was including Miss Watson as I took it  I went out in the woods
and turned it over in my mind a long time but I couldnt see no
advantage about itexcept for the other people so at last I reckoned I
wouldnt worry about it any more but just let it go  Sometimes the
widow would take me one side and talk about Providence in a way to make a
bodys mouth water but maybe next day Miss Watson would take hold and
knock it all down again  I judged I could see that there was two
Providences and a poor chap would stand considerable show with the
widows Providence but if Miss Watsons got him there warnt no help for
him any more  I thought it all out and reckoned I would belong to the
widows if he wanted me though I couldnt make out how he was agoing to
be any better off then than what he was before seeing I was so ignorant
and so kind of lowdown and ornery

Pap he hadnt been seen for more than a year and that was comfortable
for me I didnt want to see him no more  He used to always whale me
when he was sober and could get his hands on me though I used to take to
the woods most of the time when he was around  Well about this time he
was found in the river drownded about twelve mile above town so people
said  They judged it was him anyway said this drownded man was just
his size and was ragged and had uncommon long hair which was all like
pap but they couldnt make nothing out of the face because it had been
in the water so long it warnt much like a face at all  They said he was
floating on his back in the water  They took him and buried him on the
bank  But I warnt comfortable long because I happened to think of
something  I knowed mighty well that a drownded man dont float on his
back but on his face  So I knowed then that this warnt pap but a
woman dressed up in a mans clothes  So I was uncomfortable again  I
judged the old man would turn up again by and by though I wished he
wouldnt

We played robber now and then about a month and then I resigned  All
the boys did  We hadnt robbed nobody hadnt killed any people but
only just pretended  We used to hop out of the woods and go charging
down on hogdrivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market but
we never hived any of them  Tom Sawyer called the hogs ingots and he
called the turnips and stuff julery and we would go to the cave and
powwow over what we had done and how many people we had killed and
marked  But I couldnt see no profit in it  One time Tom sent a boy to
run about town with a blazing stick which he called a slogan which was
the sign for the Gang to get together and then he said he had got
secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel of Spanish
merchants and rich Arabs was going to camp in Cave Hollow with two
hundred elephants and six hundred camels and over a thousand sumter
mules all loaded down with dimonds and they didnt have only a guard
of four hundred soldiers and so we would lay in ambuscade as he called
it and kill the lot and scoop the things  He said we must slick up our
swords and guns and get ready  He never could go after even a
turnipcart but he must have the swords and guns all scoured up for it
though they was only lath and broomsticks and you might scour at them
till you rotted and then they warnt worth a mouthful of ashes more than
what they was before  I didnt believe we could lick such a crowd of
Spaniards and Arabs but I wanted to see the camels and elephants so I
was on hand next day Saturday in the ambuscade and when we got the
word we rushed out of the woods and down the hill  But there warnt no
Spaniards and Arabs and there warnt no camels nor no elephants  It
warnt anything but a Sundayschool picnic and only a primerclass at
that  We busted it up and chased the children up the hollow but we
never got anything but some doughnuts and jam though Ben Rogers got a
rag doll and Jo Harper got a hymnbook and a tract and then the teacher
charged in and made us drop everything and cut  I didnt see no
dimonds and I told Tom Sawyer so  He said there was loads of them
there anyway and he said there was Arabs there too and elephants and
things  I said why couldnt we see them then  He said if I warnt so
ignorant but had read a book called Don Quixote I would know without
asking  He said it was all done by enchantment  He said there was
hundreds of soldiers there and elephants and treasure and so on but we
had enemies which he called magicians and they had turned the whole
thing into an infant Sundayschool just out of spite  I said all
right then the thing for us to do was to go for the magicians  Tom
Sawyer said I was a numskull

Why said he a magician could call up a lot of genies and they would
hash you up like nothing before you could say Jack Robinson  They are as
tall as a tree and as big around as a church

Well I says spose we got some genies to help UScant we lick the
other crowd then

How you going to get them

I dont know  How do THEY get them

Why they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring and then the genies come
tearing in with the thunder and lightning aripping around and the smoke
arolling and everything theyre told to do they up and do it  They
dont think nothing of pulling a shottower up by the roots and belting
a Sundayschool superintendent over the head with itor any other man

Who makes them tear around so

Why whoever rubs the lamp or the ring  They belong to whoever rubs the
lamp or the ring and theyve got to do whatever he says  If he tells
them to build a palace forty miles long out of dimonds and fill it full
of chewinggum or whatever you want and fetch an emperors daughter
from China for you to marry theyve got to do itand theyve got to do
it before sunup next morning too  And more  theyve got to waltz that
palace around over the country wherever you want it you understand

Well says I I think they are a pack of flatheads for not keeping
the palace themselves stead of fooling them away like that  And whats
moreif I was one of them I would see a man in Jericho before I would
drop my business and come to him for the rubbing of an old tin lamp

How you talk Huck Finn  Why youd HAVE to come when he rubbed it
whether you wanted to or not

What and I as high as a tree and as big as a church  All right then
I WOULD come but I lay Id make that man climb the highest tree there
was in the country

Shucks it aint no use to talk to you Huck Finn  You dont seem to
know anything somehowperfect saphead

I thought all this over for two or three days and then I reckoned I
would see if there was anything in it  I got an old tin lamp and an iron
ring and went out in the woods and rubbed and rubbed till I sweat like
an Injun calculating to build a palace and sell it but it warnt no
use none of the genies come  So then I judged that all that stuff was
only just one of Tom Sawyers lies  I reckoned he believed in the Arabs
and the elephants but as for me I think different  It had all the marks
of a Sundayschool




CHAPTER IV

WELL three or four months run along and it was well into the winter
now I had been to school most all the time and could spell and read and
write just a little and could say the multiplication table up to six
times seven is thirtyfive and I dont reckon I could ever get any
further than that if I was to live forever  I dont take no stock in
mathematics anyway

At first I hated the school but by and by I got so I could stand it
Whenever I got uncommon tired I played hookey and the hiding I got next
day done me good and cheered me up  So the longer I went to school the
easier it got to be  I was getting sort of used to the widows ways
too and they warnt so raspy on me  Living in a house and sleeping in a
bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly but before the cold weather I used
to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes and so that was a rest to
me  I liked the old ways best but I was getting so I liked the new
ones too a little bit The widow said I was coming along slow but sure
and doing very satisfactory  She said she warnt ashamed of me

One morning I happened to turn over the saltcellar at breakfast  I
reached for some of it as quick as I could to throw over my left shoulder
and keep off the bad luck but Miss Watson was in ahead of me and
crossed me off She says Take your hands away Huckleberry what a mess
you are always making  The widow put in a good word for me but that
warnt going to keep off the bad luck I knowed that well enough  I
started out after breakfast feeling worried and shaky and wondering
where it was going to fall on me and what it was going to be  There is
ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck but this wasnt one of them
kind so I never tried to do anything but just poked along lowspirited
and on the watchout

I went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you go
through the high board fence  There was an inch of new snow on the
ground and I seen somebodys tracks  They had come up from the quarry
and stood around the stile a while and then went on around the garden
fence  It was funny they hadnt come in after standing around so  I
couldnt make it out  It was very curious somehow  I was going to
follow around but I stooped down to look at the tracks first  I didnt
notice anything at first but next I did  There was a cross in the left
bootheel made with big nails to keep off the devil

I was up in a second and shinning down the hill  I looked over my
shoulder every now and then but I didnt see nobody  I was at Judge
Thatchers as quick as I could get there  He said

Why my boy you are all out of breath  Did you come for your
interest

No sir I says is there some for me

Oh yes a halfyearly is in last nightover a hundred and fifty
dollars  Quite a fortune for you  You had better let me invest it along
with your six thousand because if you take it youll spend it

No sir I says I dont want to spend it  I dont want it at all
nor the six thousand nuther  I want you to take it I want to give it
to youthe six thousand and all

He looked surprised  He couldnt seem to make it out  He says

Why what can you mean my boy

I says Dont you ask me no questions about it please  Youll take it
wont you

He says

Well Im puzzled  Is something the matter

Please take it says I and dont ask me nothingthen I wont have to
tell no lies

He studied a while and then he says

Ohoo  I think I see  You want to SELL all your property to menot
give it  Thats the correct idea

Then he wrote something on a paper and read it over and says

There you see it says for a consideration  That means I have bought
it of you and paid you for it  Heres a dollar for you  Now you sign
it

So I signed it and left

Miss Watsons nigger Jim had a hairball as big as your fist which had
been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox and he used to do magic
with it  He said there was a spirit inside of it and it knowed
everything  So I went to him that night and told him pap was here again
for I found his tracks in the snow  What I wanted to know was what he
was going to do and was he going to stay  Jim got out his hairball and
said something over it and then he held it up and dropped it on the
floor  It fell pretty solid and only rolled about an inch  Jim tried
it again and then another time and it acted just the same  Jim got
down on his knees and put his ear against it and listened  But it
warnt no use he said it wouldnt talk He said sometimes it wouldnt
talk without money  I told him I had an old slick counterfeit quarter
that warnt no good because the brass showed through the silver a little
and it wouldnt pass nohow even if the brass didnt show because it was
so slick it felt greasy and so that would tell on it every time  I
reckoned I wouldnt say nothing about the dollar I got from the judge I
said it was pretty bad money but maybe the hairball would take it
because maybe it wouldnt know the difference  Jim smelt it and bit it
and rubbed it and said he would manage so the hairball would think it
was good  He said he would split open a raw Irish potato and stick the
quarter in between and keep it there all night and next morning you
couldnt see no brass and it wouldnt feel greasy no more and so
anybody in town would take it in a minute let alone a hairball  Well
I knowed a potato would do that before but I had forgot it

Jim put the quarter under the hairball and got down and listened again
This time he said the hairball was all right  He said it would tell my
whole fortune if I wanted it to  I says go on  So the hairball talked
to Jim and Jim told it to me  He says

Yo ole father doan know yit what hes agwyne to do  Sometimes he
spec hell go way en den agin he spec hell stay  De bes way is to
res easy en let de ole man take his own way  Deys two angels hoverin
roun bout him  One uv em is white en shiny en tother one is black

When I lit my candle and went up to my room that night there sat paphis
own self




CHAPTER V

I HAD shut the door to  Then I turned around and there he was  I used
to be scared of him all the time he tanned me so much  I reckoned I was
scared now too but in a minute I see I was mistakenthat is after the
first jolt as you may say when my breath sort of hitched he being so
unexpected but right away after I see I warnt scared of him worth
bothring about

He was most fifty and he looked it  His hair was long and tangled and
greasy and hung down and you could see his eyes shining through like he
was behind vines  It was all black no gray so was his long mixedup
whiskers  There warnt no color in his face where his face showed it
was white not like another mans white but a white to make a body sick
a white to make a bodys flesh crawla treetoad white a fishbelly
white  As for his clothesjust rags that was all  He had one ankle
resting on tother knee the boot on that foot was busted and two of his
toes stuck through and he worked them now and then  His hat was laying
on the flooran old black slouch with the top caved in like a lid

I stood alooking at him he set there alooking at me with his chair
tilted back a little  I set the candle down  I noticed the window was
up so he had clumb in by the shed  He kept alooking me all over  By
and by he says

Starchy clothesvery  You think youre a good deal of a bigbug DONT
you

Maybe I am maybe I aint I says

Dont you give me none o your lip says he  Youve put on
considerable many frills since I been away  Ill take you down a peg
before I get done with you  Youre educated too they saycan read and
write  You think youre bettern your father now dont you because he
cant  ILL take it out of you  Who told you you might meddle with such
hifalutn foolishness heywho told you you could

The widow  She told me

The widow heyand who told the widow she could put in her shovel
about a thing that aint none of her business

Nobody never told her

Well Ill learn her how to meddle  And looky hereyou drop that
school you hear  Ill learn people to bring up a boy to put on airs
over his own father and let on to be bettern what HE is  You lemme
catch you fooling around that school again you hear  Your mother
couldnt read and she couldnt write nuther before she died  None of
the family couldnt before THEY died  I cant and here youre
aswelling yourself up like this  I aint the man to stand ityou hear
Say lemme hear you read

I took up a book and begun something about General Washington and the
wars When Id read about a half a minute he fetched the book a whack
with his hand and knocked it across the house  He says

Its so  You can do it  I had my doubts when you told me  Now looky
here you stop that putting on frills  I wont have it  Ill lay for
you my smarty and if I catch you about that school Ill tan you good
First you know youll get religion too  I never see such a son

He took up a little blue and yaller picture of some cows and a boy and
says

Whats this

Its something they give me for learning my lessons good

He tore it up and says

Ill give you something betterIll give you a cowhide

He set there amumbling and agrowling a minute and then he says

AINT you a sweetscented dandy though  A bed and bedclothes and a
looknglass and a piece of carpet on the floorand your own father
got to sleep with the hogs in the tanyard  I never see such a son  I
bet Ill take some o these frills out o you before Im done with you
Why there aint no end to your airsthey say youre rich  Heyhows
that

They liethats how

Looky heremind how you talk to me Im astanding about all I can
stand nowso dont gimme no sass  Ive been in town two days and I
haint heard nothing but about you bein rich  I heard about it away
down the river too  Thats why I come  You git me that money
tomorrowI want it

I haint got no money

Its a lie  Judge Thatchers got it  You git it  I want it

I haint got no money I tell you  You ask Judge Thatcher hell tell
you the same

All right  Ill ask him and Ill make him pungle too or Ill know
the reason why  Say how much you got in your pocket  I want it

I haint got only a dollar and I want that to

It dont make no difference what you want it foryou just shell it
out

He took it and bit it to see if it was good and then he said he was
going down town to get some whisky said he hadnt had a drink all day
When he had got out on the shed he put his head in again and cussed me
for putting on frills and trying to be better than him and when I
reckoned he was gone he come back and put his head in again and told me
to mind about that school because he was going to lay for me and lick me
if I didnt drop that

Next day he was drunk and he went to Judge Thatchers and bullyragged
him and tried to make him give up the money but he couldnt and then
he swore hed make the law force him

The judge and the widow went to law to get the court to take me away from
him and let one of them be my guardian but it was a new judge that had
just come and he didnt know the old man so he said courts mustnt
interfere and separate families if they could help it said hed druther
not take a child away from its father  So Judge Thatcher and the widow
had to quit on the business

That pleased the old man till he couldnt rest  He said hed cowhide me
till I was black and blue if I didnt raise some money for him  I
borrowed three dollars from Judge Thatcher and pap took it and got
drunk and went ablowing around and cussing and whooping and carrying
on and he kept it up all over town with a tin pan till most midnight
then they jailed him and next day they had him before court and jailed
him again for a week  But he said HE was satisfied said he was boss of
his son and hed make it warm for HIM

When he got out the new judge said he was agoing to make a man of him
So he took him to his own house and dressed him up clean and nice and
had him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family and was just
old pie to him so to speak  And after supper he talked to him about
temperance and such things till the old man cried and said hed been a
fool and fooled away his life but now he was agoing to turn over a new
leaf and be a man nobody wouldnt be ashamed of and he hoped the judge
would help him and not look down on him  The judge said he could hug him
for them words so he cried and his wife she cried again pap said hed
been a man that had always been misunderstood before and the judge said
he believed it  The old man said that what a man wanted that was down
was sympathy and the judge said it was so so they cried again  And
when it was bedtime the old man rose up and held out his hand and says

Look at it gentlemen and ladies all take ahold of it shake it
Theres a hand that was the hand of a hog but it aint so no more its
the hand of a man thats started in on a new life andll die before
hell go back  You mark them wordsdont forget I said them  Its a
clean hand now shake itdont be afeard

So they shook it one after the other all around and cried  The
judges wife she kissed it  Then the old man he signed a pledgemade
his mark The judge said it was the holiest time on record or something
like that Then they tucked the old man into a beautiful room which was
the spare room and in the night some time he got powerful thirsty and
clumb out on to the porchroof and slid down a stanchion and traded his
new coat for a jug of fortyrod and clumb back again and had a good old
time and towards daylight he crawled out again drunk as a fiddler and
rolled off the porch and broke his left arm in two places and was most
froze to death when somebody found him after sunup  And when they come
to look at that spare room they had to take soundings before they could
navigate it

The judge he felt kind of sore  He said he reckoned a body could reform
the old man with a shotgun maybe but he didnt know no other way
