PREFACE


Benjamin Franklins reputation in America has been singularly
distorted by the neglect of his works other than his Autobiography
and his most utilitarian aphorisms If America has contented herself
with appraising him as the earliest incarnation of David Harum as
the first highpriest of the religion of efficiency as the first
Rotarian it may be that this aspect of Franklin is all that an
America plagued by growing pains by peopling and mechanizing three
thousand miles of frontier has been able to see That facet of
Franklins mind and mien which allowed Carlyle to describe him as the
Father of all Yankees was appreciated by Sinclair Lewiss George F
Babbitt Once in a while I just naturally sit back and size up this
Solid American Citizen with a whale of a lot of satisfaction But
this is not the Franklin of imperturbable commonsense honored by
Matthew Arnold as the very incarnation of sanity and clearsense a
man the most considerable  whom America has yet produced Nor is
this the Franklin who emerges from his collected works and the
opinions of his notable contemporaries as an economist political
theorist educator journalist scientific deist and disinterested
scientist If he wrote little that is narrowly belleslettres he need
not be ashamed of his voluminous correspondence in an age which saw
the fruition of the epistolary art The Franklin found in his
collected and uncollected writings is as the following Introduction
may suggest not the Franklin who too commonly is synchronized
exclusively with the wisdom and wit of Poor Richard

Since the present interpretation of the growth of Franklins mind with
stress upon its essential unity in the light of scientific deism
tempered by his debt to Puritanism classicism and neoclassicism may
seem somewhat novel the editors have felt it desirable to document
their interpretation with considerable fullness It is hoped that the
reader will withhold judgment as to the validity of this interpretation
until the documentary evidence has been fully considered in its genetic
significance and that he will feel able to incline to other
interpretations only in proportion as they can be equally supported by
other evidence The present interpretation is also supported by the
Selections followingthe fullest collection hitherto available in one
volumewhich offer the editors believe the essential materials for a
reasonable acquaintance with the growth of Franklins mind from youth
to old age in its comprehensive interestseducational literary
journalistic economic political scientific humanitarian and
religious

With the exception of the selections from the Autobiography the works
are arranged in approximate chronological order hence inviting a
necessarily genetic study of Franklins mind The Dissertation on
Liberty and Necessity Pleasure and Pain never before printed in an
edition of Franklins works or in a book of selections is here printed
from the London edition of  retaining his peculiarities of italics
capitalization and punctuation Attention is also drawn to the
photographically reproduced complete text of Poor Richard Improved
 graciously furnished by Mr William Smith Mason The Way to
Wealth is from an exact reprint made by Mr Mason and with his
permission here reproduced One of the editors is grateful for the
privilege of consulting Mr Masons magnificent collection of Franklin
correspondence original MSS especially the FranklinGalloway and
FranklinJonathan Shipley Bishop of St Asaph unpublished
correspondence With Mr Masons generous permission the editors
reproduce fragments of this correspondence in the Introduction

The bulk of the selections have been printed from the latest standard
edition The Writings of Benjamin Franklin collected and edited with
a Life and Introduction by Albert Henry Smyth  vols  For
permission to use this material the editors are grateful to The
Macmillan Company publishers The editors are indebted to Dr Max
Farrand Director of the Henry E Huntington Library for permission to
reprint part of Franklins MS version of the Autobiography

Chester E Jorgenson is preparing an analysis and interpretation of
Franklins brand of scientific deism its sources and relation to his
economic political and literary theories and practice Fragments of
this projected study are included especially in Section VII of the
following Introduction For the past two years Mr Jorgenson has enjoyed
the kindness and generosity of Mr William Smith Mason and has incurred
an indebtedness which cannot be expressed adequately in print

The work of the editors has been vastly eased by Beata Prochnow
Jorgensons assistance in typing proofreading et cetera They are
extremely grateful to Professor Harry Hayden Clark for incisive
suggestions and valuable editorial assistance

INTRODUCTION




I FRANKLINS MILIEU THE AGE OF ENLIGHTENMENT

Benjamin Franklins reputation according to John Adams was more
universal than that of Leibnitz or Newton Frederick or Voltaire and
his character more beloved and esteemed than any or all of themi
The historical critic recognizes increasingly that Adams was not
thinking idly when he doubted whether Franklins panegyrical and
international reputation could ever be explained without doing a
complete history of the philosophy and politics of the eighteenth
century Adams conceived that an explication of Franklins mind and
activities integrated with the thought patterns of the epoch which
fathered him would be one of the most important that ever was written
much more interesting to this and future ages than the Decline and Fall
of the Roman Empire And such a historical and critical colossus is
still among the works hoped for but yet unborn Too often even in the
scholarly mind Franklin has become a symbol and it may be confessed
not a winged one of the selfmade man of NewWorld practicality of
the successful tradesman of the Sage of Poor Richard with his
pennysaving economy and frugality In short the Franklin legend fails
to transcend an allegory of the success of the doer in an America
allegedly materialistic uncreative and unimaginative

It is the purpose of this essay to show that Franklin the American
Voltairealways reasonable if not intuitive encyclopedic if not
sublimely profound humane if not saintlyis best explained with
reference to the Age of Enlightenment of which he was the completest
colonial representative Due attention will however be paid to other
factors And therefore it is necessary to begin with a brief survey of
the pattern of ideas of the age to which he was responsive Not without
reason does one critic name him as the most complete representative of
his century that any nation can point toi

When Voltaire the patriarch of the philosophes in  took refuge
in England he at once discovered minds and an attitude toward human
experience which were to prove the seminal factors of the Age of
Enlightenment He found that Englishmen had acclaimed Bacon the father
of experimental philosophy and that Newton the destroyer of the
Cartesian system was as the Hercules of fabulous story to whom the
ignorant ascribed all the feats of ancient heroes Voltaire then paused
to praise Locke who destroyed innate ideas Locke than whom no man
ever had a more judicious or more methodical genius or was a more acute
logician Bacon Newton and Locke brooded over the currents of
eighteenthcentury thought and were formative factors of much that is
most characteristic of the Enlightenment

To Bacon was given the honor of having distinguished between the
fantasies of old wives tales and the certainty of empiricism Moved by
the ghost of Bacon the Royal Society had for its purpose according to
Hooke To improve the knowledge of naturall things and all useful
Arts Manufactures Mechanick practises Engynes and Inventions by
Experimentsi The zeal for experiment was equaled only by its
miscellaneousness Cheese making the eclipses of comets and the
intestines of gnats were alike the objects of telescopic or microscopic
scrutiny The full implication of Baconian empiricism came to fruition
in Newton who in  was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society Bacon
was not the least of those giants upon whose shoulders Newton stood To
the experimental tradition of Kepler Brahe Harvey Copernicus
Galileo and Bacon Newton joined the mathematical genius of Descartes
and as a result became as thoroughgoing an empiricist as he was a
consummate mathematician for whom there was no a priori
certaintyi At this time it is enough to note of Newtonianism that
for the incomparable physicist science was composed of laws stating the
mathematical behaviour of nature solelylaws clearly deducible from
phenomena and exactly verifiable in phenomenaeverything further is to
be swept out of science which thus becomes a body of absolutely certain
truth about the doings of the physical worldi The pattern of ideas
known as Newtonianism may be summarized as embracing a belief in  a
universe governed by immutable natural laws  which laws constitute a
sublimely harmonious system  reflecting a benevolent and allwise
Geometrician  thus man desires to effect a correspondingly
harmonious inner heaven  and feels assured of the plausibility of an
immortal life Newton was a believer in scriptural revelation It is
ironical that through his cosmological system mathematically
demonstrable he lent reinforcement to deism the most destructive
intellectual solvent of the authority of the altar

Deists as defined by their contemporary Ephraim Chambers in his
Cyclopdia  London  are those whose distinguishing
character it is not to profess any particular form or system of
religion but only to acknowledge the existence of a God without
rendering him any external worship or service The Deists hold that
considering the multiplicity of religions the numerous pretences to
revelation and the precarious arguments generally advanced in proof
thereof the best and surest way is to return to the simplicity of
nature and the belief of one God which is the only truth agreed to by
all nations They reject all revelations as an imposition and believe
no more than what natural light discovers to themi The
simplicity of nature signifies the established order and course of
natural things the series of second causes or the laws which God has
imposed on the motions impressed by himi And attraction a kind of
conatus accedendi is the crown according to the eighteenth century
of the series of secondary causes Hence Newtonian physics became the
surest ally of the deist in his quest for a religion immutable and
universal The Newtonian progeny were legion among them were Boyle
Keill Desaguliers Shaftesbury Locke Samuel Clarke sGravesande
Boerhaave Diderot Trenchard and Gordon Voltaire Gregory Maclaurin
Pemberton and others The eighteenth century echoed Fontenelles eulogy
that Newtonianism was sublime geometry If as Boyle wrote
mathematical and mechanical principles were the alphabet in which God
wrote the world Newtonian science and empiricism were the lexicons
which the deists used to read the cosmic volume in which the universal
laws were inscribed And the deists and the liberal political theorists
found the fulcrum for subverting existing institutions and standards
only in the laws of nature discovered as they supposed by
mathematicians and astronomersi

Complementary to Newtonian science was the sensationalism of John Locke
Conceiving the mind as tabula rasa discrediting innate ideas Lockian
psychology undermined such a theological dogma as total depravitymans
innate and inveterate malevolenceand hence was itself a kind of
tabula rasa on which later were written the optimistic opinions of
those who credited mans capacity for altruism If it remained for the
French philosophes to deify Reason Locke honored it as the crowning
experience of his sensational psychologyi Then too as Miss Lois
Whitney has ably demonstrated Lockian psychology cleared the ground
for either primitivism or a theory of progressi In addition his
social compact theory augmenting seventeenthcentury liberalism
furnished the political theorists of the Enlightenment with the
principle of Consenti in their antipathy for monarchial
obscurantism Locke has been described as the originator of a
psychology which provided democratic government with a scientific
basisi The full impact of Locke will be felt when philosophers
deduce that if sensations and reflections are the product of outward
stimulithose of nature society and institutionsthen to reform man
one needs only to reform society and institutions or remove to some
tropical isle We remember that the French Encyclopedists for example
were motivated by their faith in the indefinite malleability of human
nature by education and institutionsi

With the possible exception of John Locke C A Moore observes
Shaftesbury was more generally known in the midcentury than any other
English philosopheri Shaftesburys a priori virtuoso theory of
benevolence may be viewed as complementary to Lockes psychology to the
extent that both have within them the implication that through education
and reform man may become perfectible Both tend to undermine social
political and religious authoritarianism Shaftesburys insistence upon
mans innate altruism and compassion coupled with the deistic and
rationalistic divorce between theology and morality resulted in the
dogma that the most acceptable service to God is expressed in kindness
to Gods other children and helped to motivate the rise of
humanitarianism

The idea of progressi was popularized if not born in the
eighteenth century It has been recently shown that not only the
results of scientific investigations but also Anglican defenses of
revealed religion served to accelerate a belief in progress In answer
to the atheists and deists who indicted revealed religion because
revelation was given so late in the growth of the human family and hence
was not eternal universal and immutable the Anglican apologists were
forced into the position of asserting that man enjoyed a progressive
ascent that the religious education of mankind is like that of the
individual If as the deists charged Christ appeared rather belatedly
the apologists countered that he was sent only when the race was
prepared to profit by his coming Gods revelations thus were adjusted
to progressive needs and capacitiesi

Carl Becker has suggestively dissected the Enlightenment in a series of
antitheses between its credulity and its skepticism If the
eighteenthcentury philosopher renounced Eden he discovered Arcadia in
distant isles and America Rejecting the authority of the Bible and
church he accepted the authority of nature natural law and reason
Although scorning metaphysics he desired to be considered
philosophical If he denied miracles he yet had a fond faith in the
perfectibility of the speciesi

Even as Voltaire had his liberal tendencies stoutly reinforced by
contact with English rationalism and deismi so were the other
French philosophes united in their common hatred of the Roman
Catholic church also united in their indebtedness to exponents of
English liberalism dominated by Locke and Newton If as Madame de
Lambert wrote in  Bayle more than others of his age shook the Yoke
of authority and opinion English free thought powerfully reinforced
the native French revolt against authoritarianism After  English
was the model for French thoughti Nearly all of Lockes works had
been translated in France before  Voltaires affinity for the
English mind has already been touched on DAlembert comments When we
measure the interval between a Scotus and a Newton or rather between
the works of Scotus and those of Newton we must cry out with Terence
Homo homini quid prstati

Any doctrine was intensely welcome which would allow the Frenchman to
regain his natural rights curtailed by the revocation of the Edict of
Nantes by the inequalities of a state vitiated by privileges by an
economic structure tottering because of bankruptcy attending
unsuccessful wars and the upkeep of a Versailles with its dazzling
ornaments and by a religious program dominated by a Jesuit rather than
a Gallican churchi Economic political and religious abuses were
inextricably united the spirit of revolt did not feel obliged to
discriminate between the authority of the crown and nobles and the
authority of the altar Graphic is Diderots vulgar vituperation he
would draw out the entrails of a priest to strangle a king

Let us now turn to the American backgrounds The bibliolatry of colonial
New England is expressed in William Bradfords resolve to study
languages so that he could see with his own eyes the ancient oracles of
God in all their native beautyi In addition to furnishing the new
Canaan with ecclesiastical and political precedent Scripture provided
not a partiall but a perfect rule of Faith and manners Any dogma
contravening the ancient oracle was a weed sown by Satan and fit only
to be uprooted and thrown in the fire The colonial seventeenth century
was one which like John Cotton regularly sweetened its mouth with a
piece of Calvin One need not be reminded that Calvinism was
inveterately and completely antithetical to the dogma of the
Enlightenmenti Calvinistic bibliolatry contended with the sacred
book of nature Its wrathful though just Deity was unlike the
compassionate virtually depersonalized Deity heralded in the eighteenth
century in which the Trinity was dissolved The redemptive Christ
became the amiable philosopher Adams universally contagious guilt was
transferred to social institutions especially the tyrannical forms of
kings and priests Calvins forlorn and depraved man became a creature
naturally compassionate If once man worshipped the Deity through
seeking to parallel the divine laws scripturally revealed in the
eighteenth century he honored his benevolent God who was above
demanding worship through kindnesses shown Gods other children The
individual was lost in society selfperfection gave way to
humanitarianism God to Man theology to morality and faith to reason
The colonial seventeenth century was politically oligarchical when
Thomas Hooker heckled Winthrop on the lack of suffrage Winthrop with no
compromise asserted that the best part is always the least and of that
best part the wiser part is always the lesseri If the
seventeenthcentury college was a cloister for clerical education the
Enlightenment sought to train the layman for citizenship

With the turn of the seventeenth century several forces came into
prominence undermining New Englands Puritan heritage Among those
relevant for our study are the ubiquitous frontier and the rise of
Quakerism deism Methodism and science The impact of the frontier was
neglected until Professor Turner called attention to its existence he
writes that the most important effect of the frontier has been in the
promotion of democracy here and in Europe It produces antipathy to
control and particularly to any direct control The frontier
conditions prevalent in the colonies are important factors in the
explanation of the American Revolutioni In the period included
in our survey the frontier receded from the coast to the fall line to
the Alleghenies at each stage it did indeed furnish a new field of
opportunity a gate of escape from the bondage of the past and
freshness and confidence and scorn of older society impatience of its
restraints and its ideas and indifference to its lessons have
accompanied the frontieri One recalls the spirited satire on
frontier conditions as the above aspects give birth to violence and
disregard for law in Hugh Brackenridges Modern Chivalry Under the
satire one feels the justness of the attack intensified by our
knowledge that Brackenridge grew up in a democratic ScotchIrish
backcountry settlement If the frontiersmen during the eighteenth
century did not place their dirty boots on their governors desks they
were partially responsible for an inveterate spirit of revolt shown so
brutally in the massacres provoked by the Paxton boys of
Pennsylvania One is not unprepared to discover resentment against the
forms of authority in a territory in which a strong back is more
immediately important than a knowledge of debates on predestination
Granting the importance of the frontier in opposing the theocratic Old
Way it must be considered in terms of other and more complex factors

Reinforcing Edwardss Great Awakening George Whitefield especially in
the Middle Colonies challenged the growing complacence of colonial
religious thought with his insistence that man is by nature halfbrute
and halfdevil It has been suggested that Methodism in effect allied
itself with the attitudes of Hobbes and Mandeville in attacking mans
nature and hence by reaction tended to provoke a primitivism based on
the doctrine of natural benevolencei

The New English Israel was harried by the Quakersi who preached
the priesthood of all believers and the right of private judgment They
denied the total depravity of the natural man and the doctrine of
election they gloried in a loving Father and scourged the
ecclesiastical pomp and ceremony of other religions They were possessed
by a blunt enthusiasm which held the immediate private revelation
anterior to scriptural revelation Faithful to the inner light the
Quakers seemed to neglect Scripture Although the less extreme Quakers
such as John Woolman did not blind themselves to the need for personal
introspection and selfconquest Quakerism as a movement tended to place
the greater emphasis on morality articulate in terms of fellowservice
and lent momentum to the rise of humanitarianism expressed in prison
reform and antislavery agitation Also one may wonder to what extent
colonial Quakerism tended to lend sanction to the rising democratic
spirit

In the person of Cotton Mather until recently considered a bigoted
incarnation of the Puritan spirit  become ossified are discovered
forces which when divorced from Puritan theology were to become the
sharpest wedges splintering the deeprooted oak of the Old Way These
forces were the authority of reason and science In The Christian
Philosopheri basing his attitude on the works of Ray Derham
Cheyne and Grewi Mather attempted to shatter the Calvinists
antithesis between science and theology asserting that Natural
Philosophy is no Enemy but a mighty and wondrous Incentive to
Religioni He warned that since even Mahomet with the aid of
reason found the Workman in his Work Christian theologians should fear
lest a Mahometan be called in for thy Condemnationi Studying
natures sublime order one must be blind if his thoughts are not
carried heavenward to admire that Wisdom itself Although Mather
mistrusted Reason he accepted it as the voice of Godan experience
which enabled him to discover the workmanship of the Deity in nature
Magnetism the vegetable kingdom the stars infer a harmonious order so
wondrous that only a God could have created it If Reason is no complete
substitute for Scripture it offers enough evidence to hiss atheism out
of the world A Being that must be superior to Matter even the Creator
and Governor of all Matter is everywhere so conspicuous that there can
be nothing more monstrous than to deny the God that is abovei Sir
Isaac Newton with his mathematical and experimental proof of the sublime
universal order strung on invariable secondary causes Mather confessed
is our perpetual Dictatori Conceiving of science as a rebuke to
the atheist and a natural ally to scriptural theology Mather like a
Newton himself juxtaposed rationalism and faith in one pyramidal
confirmation of the existence omnipotence and benevolence of God Here
were variations from Calvinisms common path which when augmented by
English and French liberalism by the influence of Quakerism and the
frontier were to give rise to democracy rationalism and scientific
deism The Church of England through the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries had pursued a liberal latitudinarian policy which as a mode
of thought tended to promote deism by emphasizing rational religion and
minimizing revelationi It was to be expected that in colonies
created by Puritans or even Quakers deism would have a less
spectacular and extensive success than it appears to have had in the
mother country If militant deism remained an aristocratic cult until
the Revolutioni scientific rationalism Newtonianism long before
this from the time of Mather became a common ally of orthodoxy If a
religion of nature may be defined with Tillotson as obedience to
Natural Law and the performance of such duties as Natural Light
without any express and supernatural revelation doth dictate to man
then it was in the colonies prior to the Revolution more commonly a
buttress to revealed religion than an equivalent to it

Lockian sensism and Newtonian science were the chief sources of that
brand of colonial rationalism which at first complemented orthodoxy and
finally buried it among lost causes The Marquis de Chastellux was
astounded when he found on a center table in a Massachusetts inn an
Abridgment of Newtons Philosophy whereupon he put some questions
to his host on physics and geometry with which he found him well
acquaintedi Now even a superficial reading of the eighteenth
century discloses countless allusions to Newton his popularizers and
the implications of his physics and cosmology As Mr Brasch suggests
From the standpoint of the history of science the extent of the vogue
of Newtonianism is yet very largely unknown historyi

In Samuel Johnsons retrospective view the Yale of  at Saybrook was
anything but progressive with its scholastic cobwebs of a few little
English and Dutch systemsi The year of Johnsons graduation
 however Mr Dummer Yales agent in London collected seven
hundred volumes including works of Norris Barrow Tillotson Boyle
Halley and the second edition  of the Principia and a copy of
the Optics presented by Newton himself After the schism of 
the collection was moved to New Haven at the time of Johnsons election
to a tutorship It was then writes Johnson that the trustees
introduced the study of Mr Locke and Sir Isaac Newton as fast as they
could and in order to this the study of mathematics The Ptolemaic
system was hitherto as much believed as the Scriptures but they soon
cleared up and established the Copernican by the help of Whistons
Lectures Derham etci Johnson studied Euclid algebra and conic
sections so as to read Sir Isaac with understanding He gloomily
reviews the infidelity and apostasy resulting from the study of the
ideas of Locke Tindal Bolingbroke Mandeville Shaftesbury and
Collins That Newtonianism and even deism made progress at Yale is the
tenor of Johnsons backward glance About  Samuel Clarkes edition
of Rohault was introduced at Yale Clarkes Rohaulti was an attack
upon this standard summary of Cartesianism Ezra Stiles was not certain
that Clarke was honest in heaping up notes not so much to illustrate
Rohault as to make him the Vehicle of conveying the peculiarities of the
sublimer Newtonian Philosophyi This work was used until  when
sGravesandes Natural Philosophy was wisely substituted Rector
Thomas Clap used Wollastons Religion of Nature Delineated as a
favorite text That there was no dearth of advanced natural science and
philosophy even suggestive of deism is fairly evident

Measured by the growth of interest in science in the English
universities Harvards awareness of new discoveries was not especially
backward in the seventeenth century Since Copernicanism at the close of
the sixteenth century had few adherentsi it is almost startling to
learn that probably by  the Copernican system was openly avowed at
Harvardi In  Nathaniel Mather wrote from Dublin I perceive
the Cartesian philosophy begins to obteyn in New England and if I
conjecture aright the Copernican system tooi John Barnard who
was graduated from Harvard in  has written that no algebra was then
taught and wistfully suggests that he had been born too soon since
now students have the great Sir Isaac Newton and Dr Halley and some
other mathematicians for their guidesi Although Thomas Robie and
Nathan Prince are thought to have known Newtons physics through
secondary sourcesi and as Harvard tutors indoctrinated their
charges with Newtonianism it was left to Isaac Greenwoodi to
transplant from London the popular expositions of Newtonian philosophy
A Harvard graduate in  Greenwood continued his theological studies
in London where he attended Desagulierss lectures on experimental
philosophy based essentially on Newtonianism From Desaguliers
Greenwood learned how

    By Newtons help tis evidently seen
    Attraction governs all the Worlds machinei

He learned that Scripture is to teach us Morality and our Articles of
Faith but not to serve as an instructor in natural philosophyi In
fine Greenwood became devoted to science and science as it might serve
to augment avenues to the religious experience In London he had come to
know Hollis who in  suggested to Harvard authorities that Greenwood
be elected Hollis Professor of Mathematics and Natural and Experimental
Philosophyi Greenwood accepted and until  was at Harvard a
propagandist of the new science In  he advertised in the Boston
NewsLetteri that he would give scientific lectures revolving
primarily around the Discoveries of the incomparable Sir Isaac Newton
From  through  he was a prominent popularizer of Newtonianism in
Bostoni

It remained for Greenwoods pupil John Winthrop to be the first to teach
Newton at Harvard with adequate mechanical and textual materials
Elected in  to the Hollis professorship formerly held by Greenwood
Winthrop adopted sGravesandes Natural Philosophy at which time
Cajori observes the teachings of Newton had at last secured a firm
footing therei The year after his election he secured a copy of
the Principia the third edition  edited by Dr Henry Pemberton
friend of Franklin in  According to the astute Ezra Stiles
Winthrop became a perfect master of Newtons Principiawhich cannot be
said of many Professors of Philosophy in Europei That he did not
allow Newtonianism to draw him to deism may be seen in Stiless
gratification that Winthrop was a Firm friend to Revelation in
opposition to Deism Stiles wishes the evangelical Doctors of Grace
had made a greater figure in his Ideal System of divinity thus
inferring that Winthrop was a rationalist in theology however
orthodoxi

A cursory view of the eighteenthcentury pulpit discloses that if the
clergy did not become deistic they were not blind to a natural religion
and often employed its arguments to augment scriptural authority Aware
of the writings of Samuel Clarke Wollaston Whiston Cudworth Butler
Hutchesoni Voltaire and Locke Mayhew revolts against total
depravityi and the doctrines of election and the Trinity arraigns
himself against authoritarianism and obscurantism and though he draws
upon reason for revelation of Gods will he does not seem to have been
latitudinarian in respect to the holy oracles Although he often wrote
ambiguously concerning the nature of Christ he asserted That I ever
denied or treated in a bold or ludicrous manner the divinity of the
Son of God as revealed in scripture I absolutely denyi He is
antagonistic toward the mystical in Calvinism convinced that The love
of God is a calm and rational thing the result of thought and
considerationi His biographer thinks that Mayhew was the first
clergyman in New England who expressly and openly opposed the scholastic
doctrine of the trinityi Coupling natural and revealed
religion he does not threaten but he urges that one ought not to
leave the clear light of revelation It becomes us to adhere to the
holy Scriptures as our only rule of faith and practice discipline and
worshipi In Mayhew one finds an impotent compromise between
Calvinism and the demands of reason fostered by the Enlightenment Like
Mayhews in the main are the views of Dr Charles Chauncy who
reconciled the demands of reason and revelation concluding that the
voice of reason is the voice of Godi Jason Haven and Jonas Clarke
are typical of the orthodox rationalists who were alive to the
implications of science and to such rationalists as Tillotson and
Locke Haven affirms that by the light of reason and nature we are led
to believe in and adore God not only as the maker but also as the
governor of all thingsi Revelation comes in to the assistance of
reason and shews them to us in a clearer light than we could see them
without its aid Clarke observes that the light of nature teaches
which revelation confirmsi Rev Henry Cumings illustrating his
indebtedness to scientific rationalism honors the gracious Parent of
the universe whose tender mercies are over all his works i a
Deity whose providence governs the world whose voice all nature obeys
to whose controul all second causes and subordinate agents are subject
and whose sole prerogative it is to dispense blessings or calamities as
to his wisdom seems besti Simeon Howard discovers the
perfections of the Deity as displayed in the Creation as well as in
the government and redemption of the worldi Both Phillips
Paysoni and Andrew Elioti affirm the identity of the voice of
reason and the voice of God

No clergyman of the eighteenth century was more terribly conscious of
the polarity of colonial thought than was Ezra Stiles Abiel Holmes has
told the graphic story of Stiless struggles with deism after reading
Pope Whiston Boyle Trenchard and Gordon Butler Tindal Collins
Bolingbroke and Shaftesburyi If he finally as a result of his
trembling and fearful doubt reaffirmed zealously his faith in the
bibliolatry and relentless dogma of Calvinismi Newtonian
rationalism was a means to his recovery and throughout his life a
complement to his Calvinismi Turning from his wellworn Bible the
chief source of his faith he also kindled his devotion at the stars
It should be remembered however that this tendency among Puritan
clergy to call science to the support of theology had been inaugurated
by Cotton Mather as early as i and that it was the Puritan
Mather whom Franklin acknowledged as having started him on his career
and influenced him by his Essays to do Good throughout life

Only against this complex and as yet inadequately integrated background
of physical conditions and ideas the dogmas of Puritanism Quakerism
Methodism rationalism scientific deism economic and political
liberalismiagainst a cosmic social and individual attitude the
result of OldWorld thought impinging on colonial thought and
environment can one attempt to appraise adequately the mind and
achievements of Franklin whose life was coterminous with the decay of
Puritan theocracy and the rise of rationalism democracy and science



II FRANKLINS THEORIES OF EDUCATION

Franklins penchant for projects manifests itself nowhere more fully
than in his schemes of education both self and formal One may deduce a
pattern of educational principles not undeservedly called Franklins
theories of education theories which he successfully
institutionalized from an examination of his Junto the best school of
philosophy morality and politics that then existed in the
provincei his Philadelphia Library Company his first project
of a public naturei his Proposal for Promoting Useful
Knowledge among the British Plantations in America calling for a
scientific society of ingenious men or virtuosi his Proposals Relating
to the Education of Youth in Pensilvania and Idea of the English
School which eventually fathered the University of Pennsylvania and
from his fragmentary notes in his correspondence

Variously apotheosized patronized or damned for his practicality
expediency and opportunism dramatized for his allegiance to
materiality Franklin has commonly been viewed and not only through the
popular imagination as one fostering in the American mind an
unimaginative utilitarian prudence motivated by the pedestrian virtues
of industry frugality and thrift Whatever the educational effect of
Franklins life and writings on American readers we shall find that his
works contain schemes and theories which transcend the more mundane
habits and utilitarian biases ascribed to him

Franklin progressively felt the loss of the learned education his
father had planned for him as he realized in his hunger for knowledge
that he must repair the loss through assiduous reading accomplished
during hours stolen from recreation and sleepi Proudly he
confessed that reading was his only amusementi In  he formed
the Junto or Leather Apron Club his first educational project
Franklin was never more eclectic than when founding the Junto To
prevent Boston homes from becoming the porches of helli Cotton
Mather had created mutual improvement societies through which neighbors
would help one another with a rapturous assiduityi Mather in his
Essays to do Good proposed

    That a proper number of persons in a neighborhood whose
    hearts God hath touched with a zeal to do good should form
    themselves into a society to meet when and where they shall
    agree and to considerwhat are the disorders that we may
    observe rising among us and what may be done either by
    ourselves immediately or by others through our advice to
    suppress those disordersi

Since Franklins father was a member of one of Mathers Associated
Families and since Franklin as a boy read Mathers Essays with rapt
attentioni and since his Rules for a Club Established for Mutual
Improvement are amazingly congruent with Mathers rules proposed for
his neighborly societies it is not improbable that Franklin in part
copied the plans of this older club One also wonders whether Franklin
remembered Defoes suggestions in Essays upon Several Projects 
for the formation of Friendly Societies in which members covenanted to
aid one anotheri In addition M Fa has observed that the ideal
which this society the Junto adopted was the same that Franklin had
discovered in the Masonic lodges of Englandi Then too in London
during the period of Desaguliers Sir Hans Sloane and Sir Isaac Newton
he would have heard much of the ideals and utility of the Royal Society
Many of the questions discussed by the Junto are suggestive of the
calendar of the Royal Society

    Is sound an entity or body

    How may the phenomena of vapors be explained

    What is the reason that the tides rise higher in the Bay of
    Fundy than the Bay of Delaware

    How may smoky chimneys be best cured

    Why does the flame of a candle tend upwards in a spirei

The Junto members like Renaissance gentlemen were determined to
convince themselves that nothing valuable to the several powers of life
should be alien to them They were urged to communicate to one another
anything significant in history morality poetry physic travels
mechanic arts or other parts of knowledgei Surely a humanistic
catholicity of interest Schemes for getting on materially suggestions
for improving the laws and protecting the just liberties of the
peoplei efforts to aid the strangers in Philadelphia an
embryonic association of commerce curiosity in the latest remedies
used for the sick and wounded all were to engage the minds of this
assiduously curious club Above all the members must be serviceable to
mankind to their country to their friends or to themselvesi
The intensity of the Juntos utilitarian purpose was matched only by its
humanitarian bias Members must swear that they love mankind in
general of what profession or religion soeveri and that they
believe no man should be persecuted for mere speculative opinions or
his external way of worship Also they must profess to love truth for
truths sake to search diligently for it and to communicate it to
others Tolerance the empirical method scientific disinterestedness
and humanitarianism had hardly gained a foothold in the colonies in
 On the other hand the Junto members were urged when throwing a
kiss to the world not to neglect their individual ethical
developmenti Franklins humanitarian neighborliness is associated
with a rigorous ethicism The members were invited to report unhappy
effects of intemperance of imprudence of passion or of any other
vice or folly and also happy effects of temperance of prudence of
moderation Franklin reflects sturdily here and boundlessly elsewhere
the Greek and English emphasis on the Middle Way If this is prudential
it is an elevated prudence

The Philadelphia Library Company was born of the Junto and became the
mother of all the North American subscription libraries now so
numerousi The colonists having no publick amusements to divert
their attention from study became better acquainted with books and in
a few years were observd by strangers to be better instructed and more
intelligent than people of the same rank generally are in other
countriesi It is curious that although many articles have been
written describing the Library Company no one seems to include a study
of the climate of ideas represented in its volumesi One must be
careful not to credit Franklin with solely presiding over the ordering
of books At a meeting in  of the company Thomas Godfrey probable
inventor of the quadrant and he who learned Latin to read the
Principia notified the body that Mr Logan had let him know he would
willingly give his advice of the choice of the books  the Committee
esteeming Mr Logan to be a Gentleman of universal learning and the
best judge of books in these parts ordered that Mr Godfrey should wait
on him and request him to favour them with a catalogue of suitable
booksi The first order included Puffendorfs Introduction and
Laws of Nature Hayes upon Fluxions Keills Astronomical Lectures
Sidney on Government Gordon and Trenchards Catos Letters the
Spectator Guardian Tatler LHospitals Conic Sections
Addisons works Xenophons Memorabilia Palladio Evelyn Abridgement
of Philosophical Transactions sGravesandes Natural Philosophy
Homers Odyssey and Iliad Bayles Critical Dictionary and
Drydens Virgil As a gift Peter Collinson included Newtons
Principia in the order The ancient phalanxes were thoroughly routed
Then there is the MS List of Books of the Original Philadelphia Library
in Franklins Handwritingi which lends recruits to the modern
battalions Included in this list are Fontenelle on Oracles Woodwards
Natural History of Fossils and Natural History of the Earth Keills
Examination of Burnets Theory of the Earth Memoirs of the Royal
Academy of Surgery at Paris William Pettys Essays Voltaires
Elements of Sir Isaac Newtons Philosophy Halleys Astronomical
Tables Hills Review of the Works of the Royal Society
Montesquieus Spirit of Laws Burlamaquis Principles of Natural Law
and Principles of Politic Law Bolingbrokes Letters on the Study and
Use of History and Conyer Middletons Miscellaneous Works From the
volumes owned by the Library Company in  it would have been possible
for an alert mind to discover all of the implications philosophic and
religious of the rationale of science No less could be found here the
political speculations which were later to aid the colonists in unyoking
themselves from England The Library was an arsenal capable of
supplying weapons to rationalistic minds intent on besieging the
fortress of Calvinism Defenders of natural rights could find ammunition
to wound monarchism here authors could discover the neoclassic ideals
of curiosa felicitas perspicuity order and lucidity reinforced by
the emphasis on clarity and correctness sponsored by the Royal Society
and inherent in Newtonianism as well as Cartesianism In short the
volumes contained the ripest fruition of scientific and rationalistic
modernity One can only conjecture the extent to which this library
would perplex astonish and finally convert men to rationalism and
scientific deism and release them from bondage to throne and altar

In  Franklin wrote and distributed among his correspondents A
Proposal for Promoting Useful Knowledge among the British Plantations in
America From a letter Feb   of William Douglass onetime
friend of Franklins brother James to Cadwallader Colden we learn that
some years before  Colden proposed the forming a sort of Virtuoso
Society or rather Correspondencei I W Riley suggests that
Franklin owes Colden thanks for having stimulated him to form the
American Philosophical Societyi There remains no convincing
evidence however to disprove A H Smyths observation that Franklins
Proposal appears to contain the first suggestions in any public
form editors italics for an American Philosophical Society P S
Du Ponceau has noted with compelling evidence that the philosophical
society formed in  was the direct descendant of Franklins
Juntoi That in part the Philadelphia Library Company was one of
the factors in the formation of the scientific society may be inferred
from Franklins request that it be founded in Philadelphia which
having the advantages of a good growing library can be the centre of
the Societyi The most important factor however was obviously
the desire to imitate the forms and ideals of the Royal Society of
London Both societies had as their purpose the improvement of the
common stock of knowledge neither was to be provincial or national in
interests but was to have in mind the benefit of mankind in general
A study of Franklins Proposal will suggest the purpose of the Royal
Society as interpreted by Thomas Sprat

    Their purpose is in short to make faithful Records of all
    the Works of Nature or Art which can come within their
    reach that so the present Age and posterity may be able to
    put a mark on the Errors which have been strengthened by
    long prescription to restore the Truths that have lain
    neglected to push on those which are already known to more
    various uses and to make the way more passable to what
    remains unrevealdi

The Royal Society no less than Franklins Proposal stressed the
usefulness of its experimentation Even as it sought to overcome the
mysteries of all the Works of Naturei through experimentation and
induction the Baconian empirical method so Franklin urged the
cultivation of all philosophical experiments that let light into the
nature of things tend to increase the power of man over matter and
multiply the conveniences or pleasures of lifei Though Franklin
may have stopped short of theoretical sciencei he was not only
interested in making devices but also in discovering immutable natural
laws on which he could base his mechanics for making the world more
habitable less unknown and terrifying Interpreting natural phenomena
in terms of gravity and the laws of electrical attraction and repulsion
is to detract from the terror in a universe presided over by a
providential Deity exerting his wrath through portentous comets
fireballs flung by an angry God

Franklins program is no more miscellaneous or seemingly pedestrian
than the practices of the Royal Society As a discoverer of natures
laws and their application to mans use Franklin the Newton of
electricity appealed to fact and experiment rather than authority and
suggested that education in science may serve in addition to making the
world more comfortable to make it more habitable and less terrifying
The ideals of scientific research and disinterestedness were dramatized
picturesquely by the Tradesman Franklin who aided the colonist in
becoming unafraid

Although his Proposals Relating to the Education of Youth in
Pensilvania  furnished the initial suggestion which created the
Philadelphia Academy later the college and ultimately the University
of Pennsylvania it is easy to overestimate the real significance of
Franklins influence in these schemes unless we remember that political
quarrels separated him from those who were nurturing the school in the
s In  Franklin wrote from London to his friend Professor
Kinnersley concerning the cabal in the Academy against him The
Trustees have reapd the full Advantage of my Head Hands Heart and
Purse in getting through the first Difficulties of the Design and when
they thought they could do without me they laid me asidei
After Franklin failed to secure Samuel Johnsoni Rev William
Smith was made Provost and Professor of Natural Philosophy of the
Academy in  He quoted Franklin as saying that the Academy had
become a narrow bigoted institution put into the hands of the
Proprietary party as an engine of governmenti

With Milton Locke Fordyce Walker Rollin Turnbull and some
others as his sources Franklin adapted the works of these pioneers in
education to provincial uses One finds it difficult to discover any
original ideas in the Proposals Like Locke and Milton he urged that
education supply the succeeding Age with Men qualified to serve the
Publick with Honour to themselves and to their Countryi Here he
was unlike President Clap who in  explained that the Original End
and design of Colleges was to instruct and train up persons for the Work
of the ministry The great design of founding this school Yale was
to educate ministers in our own wayi As early as  in
Dogood Paper No IV Franklin caricatured sardonically the narrow
theological curriculum of Harvard Collegei Existing for the
citizenry rather than the clergy offering instruction in English as
well as Latin and Greek in mechanics physical culture natural
history gardening mathematics and arithmetic rather than in sectarian
theology Franklins Academy was to be more secular and utilitarian than
any other school in the provinces Indeed Rev George Whitefield
lamented the want of aliquid Christi in the curriculum to make it
as useful as I would desire it might be

Franklin stressed the need for the acquisition of a clear and concise
literary style He observed Reading should also be taught and
pronouncing properly distinctly emphatically not with an even Tone
which underdoes nor a theatrical which overdoes Nature Hence
he reflected the virtues of neoclassic perspicuity and correctness
These plans he more fully expressed in his Idea of the English
School published in  As he grew older he apparently became less
tolerant of the teaching of the ancient languages in colonial schools
in Observations Relative to the Intentions of the Original Founders of
the Academy of Philadelphia  he charged that the Latin school
had swallowed the English and that he was hence surrounded by the
Ghosts of my dear departed Friends beckoning and urging me to use the
only Tongue now left us in demanding that Justice to our Grandchildren
that our Children has sic been deniedi The Latin and Greek
languages he considered in no other light than as the Chapeau bras of
modern Literaturei Like Emersons his opposition was to
linguistic study rather than to the classical ideas

Although he emphasized the study of science and mechanics it is
important to observe that he kept his balance He warned Miss Mary
Stevenson in  There is  a prudent Moderation to be used in
Studies of this kind The Knowledge of Nature may be ornamental and it
may be useful but if to attain an Eminence in that we neglect the
Knowledge and Practice of essential Duties we deserve
Reprehensioni Not without reserve did he champion the Moderns
remembering several provocative scientific observations in Pliny he
wrote to William Brownrigg Nov   It has been of late too much
the mode to slight the learning of the ancientsi He would not
agree with the enthusiastic and trenchant disciple of the moderns M
Fontenelle that We are under an obligation to the ancients for having
exhausted almost all the false theories that could be foundi
Although he would agree that the empirical method of acquiring knowledge
is more reasonable than authoritarianism reared on syllogistic
foundations and with Cowley that

    Bacon has broke that scarcrow Deity Authorityi

he was not blithely confident that science and the knowledge gained from
experimentation would create a more rigorously moral race He wrote to
Priestley in  I should rejoice much if I could once more recover
the Leisure to search with you into the Works of Nature I mean the
inanimate not the animate or moral part of them the more I
discoverd of the former the more I admird them the more I know of
the latter the more I am disgusted with themi He often
suggested As Men grow more enlightened but seldom did this clause
carry more than an intellectual connotation Progress in
knowledgei did not on the whole suggest to Franklin progress in
morals or the general progress of mankind

Essentially classical in morality extolling a temperance like that of
Xenophon Epictetus Cicero Socrates and Aristotle Franklin could not
cheerily champion the moderns without serious reservations Considering
only progress in knowledge man may be considered as pedetentim
progredientes but Franklin thought man seemed to have found it
easier to conquer lightning than himself If science and other
contemporaneous knowledge detracted from cosmic terror it did not solve
the problem of the mystery of evil and sin like Shakespeare Franklin
was perplexed by the inexplicability and ruthlessness of Mans potential
and actual malevolencei Thus in stressing utility and vocational
adaptiveness Franklin did not forget to stress the need for development
of character mans internal self and here he did not find the ancients
dispensablei If unlike Socrates in his studies of physical
nature he was like the Athenian gadfly in his quest for moral
perfection in the teeth of perpetual temptation in his strenuous and
sober effort to know himself Too little attention has been paid
Franklins Hellenic sobrietyeven as it has had too meagre an
influence Let Molire challenge The ancients are the ancients we are
the people of today Franklin although confident that he could learn
more of physical nature from Newton than from Aristotle was not
convinced that the wisdom of Epictetus or the Golden Verses of
Pythagoras were less salutary than the wit of his own age A modern in
his confidence in the progress of knowledge Franklin approaching the
problem of morality wisely saw the ancients and moderns as
complementary Aware of the continuity of the mind and race he was not
willing to dismiss the ancients as fit to be imitated Yet he failed to
discover in the welter of egoistic men any continuous moral progress
although unlike the determinists he thought that the individual could
improve himself through selfknowledge and selfcontrol Unlike
contemporary exponents of the original genius cult who scorned
industrious rational study and conformity Franklin as an educational
theorist was the exponent of reason and of conscious intellectual
industry and thrift he would mediate between the study of nature and of
man and like Aristotle he would rely not so much upon individualistic
selfexpression as upon a purposeful imitation of those men in the
past who had led useful and happy lives



III FRANKLINS LITERARY THEORY AND PRACTICEi

Uniting the wit of Voltaire with the simplicity of Rousseau Franklin
achieved a style only surpassed by the unimprovable Hobbes of
Malmesbury the paragon of perspicuity Characterized by simplicity
order and a trenchant pointedness his prose style was a principal
means of his advancementi

He was extreamly ambitious  to be a tolerable English writer In
the Autobiography he recalls that he read books in polemic divinity
Plutarchs Lives probably Drydens translation Pilgrims Progress
Defoes Essays upon Several Projects Mathers Essays to do Good
Xenophons Memorabiliai the Spectator papers and the
writings of Shaftesbury and Collins

Born in Boston he knew the Biblei characterized by the apostle
of Augustan correctness Jonathan Swift as possessing that simplicity
which is one of the greatest perfections in any language If Franklin
did not achieve its sublime eloquence he approximated at intervals
its directness and simplicity In reading Defoes Essays he learned
that Queen Annes England urged that writers be as concise as possible
and avoid all superfluous crowding in of insignificant words more than
are needful to express the thing intended It is possible that Defoes
efforts to polish and refine the English tongue to avoid all
irregular additions that ignorance and affectation have introduced
influenced Franklin in favor of correctness and against
provincialisms Defoes explicit easy free and very plain rhetoric
is Franklins

After Franklins father warned him that his arguments were not
wellordered and trenchantly expressed he desperately sought to acquire
a convincing prose style In  James Franklins elder brother
returned from serving a printers apprenticeship in London James had
known and been attracted to Augustan England the England of the
Tatler Spectator and Guardian Familiar is Franklins narrative
of how he patterned his fledgling style on the pages of the Spectator
papers and learned to satisfy his fatherand himself Like the
neoclassicists Franklin learned to write by imitation by respectfully
subordinating himself to those he recognized as masters and not like
the romanticists by expressing his own ego in revolt against convention
and conformity to traditional standards The group who supplied copy for
Jamess New England Courant we are told were trying to write like
the Spectator The very look of an ordinary first page of the
Courant is like that of the Spectator pagei In the Dogood
Papers  and the BusyBody series  Franklins writings
show a literal indebtedness to the style and even substance of the
Spectatori If after the BusyBody essays Franklins
writings bear little resemblance to the elegance and glow of the
Spectator he did learn from it a longremembered lesson in
orderliness From the Spectator he may have learned to temper wit with
morality and morality with wit he may have learned the neoclassic
objection to the unhappy Force of an Imagination unguided by the Check
of Reason and Judgmenti he may have acquired his distrust of
foreign phrases when English ones were as good or better insisting on
the use of native English undefiled It is interesting but perhaps
futile to conjecture to what degree Franklin at this time on reading
Spectator No  On Geniuses warning against a servile imitation
of ancient authors a warning which anticipates the cult of original
geniuses of later decades would have been predisposed against ancient
literature and languages If the Spectator was partially responsible
for his pleasantries at the expense of Greek in Dogood Paper No IV
his attitude toward the ancients is more ostensibly the result of his
later preoccupation with the sciencesi and of contact with
representatives of the deistic timespirit whose faith in progress led
them to underrate the past

When Franklin went to live in London in  and became familiar
with such men of science as Dr Henry Pemberton and others he must have
become aware of ideals of prose style not a little unlike those
practised by the preachers of his Boston In Boston he had heard and in
the polemical works in his fathers library read sermons couched in a
style satirized in Hudibras as a Babylonish dialect  of patched
and piebald languages ll  ff Sensing the disparity between the
seventeenthcentury prose styles and the empirical logical and
orderly method of science the Royal Society not long after its
inception inaugurated a campaign for a clarity akin to the pattern urged
by Hobbes The Light of humane minds is Perspicuous Words Reason is
the Pace Encrease of Science the way and the benefit of mankind
the end And on the contrary Metaphors and senseless and ambiguous
words are like ignes fatui and reasoning upon them is wandering
among innumerable absurditiesi Summarizing the intent of the
stylistic reformations instituted by the Royal Society Thomas Sprat
urged writers to reject all the amplifications digressions and
swellings of style to return back to the primitive purity and
shortness when men deliverd so many things almost in an equal number
of words  a close naked natural way of speaking positive
expressions clear senses a native easiness bringing all things as
near the Mathematical plainness as they can and preferring the
language of Artizans Countrymen and Merchants before that of Wits
or Scholarsi It is asserted that the program of the Royal
Society called for stylistic reform as loudly as for reformation in
philosophy Moreover this attitude was in the public mind indissolubly
associated with the Societyi It is only reasonable to infer that
Franklin as a member of the Royal Society and as founder of the
American Philosophical Society was alive to the movement toward
undefiled plainness which had for half a century been gathering
momentumi

Even as Cartesianismi in France is said to have fostered logic and
lucidity of detail and that which is universally valid and recognized
by all men and that art which is aloof to the nonhuman world so in
England may Newtonianism which overthrew Cartesianism have conditioned
writers to develop a uniform style purged of tenuous rhetorical
devices An age characterized by a worship of reason which was supposed
to be identical in all men an age deferring to the general mind of man
would be hostile to the rhetorical caprices of those expressing their
private idiosyncratic enthusiasms If the neoclassic apotheosis of
simplicity and freedom from intricacy was the result of a rationalistic
antiintellectualismi expressed in terms of hostility to
belabored proof of ideas known to the general will then it would seem
that one of the factors sturdily conditioning this hostility was
Newtonian science Admitting that reason leads to uniformitarianism
one may recall that the processes of science are discoverable by reason
and that such a cosmologist as Newton illustrated mathematically and
empirically a system grand in its lucidity and capable of being
apprehended by all through reason If the deistic fear of enthusiasm
in religionthe individual will prevailing against the consensus
gentiumparallels according to Professor Lovejoy the neoclassic fear
of feeling and the unrestrained play of imagination in art then
Newtonian science as it reinforced deism was no negligible factor in
discrediting enthusiasm and hence indirectly militating against
originality emotion and the unchecked imagination Is it not
conceivable that the Newtoniani cosmology popularized by a vast
discipleship challenged the scientists and men of letters alike to
achieve a corresponding order clarity and simplicity in poetry and
prose

After Franklins return from London he reinforced his Addisonlike
style with the rhetorical implications of science and Newtonianism in
his Preface  to the Pennsylvania Gazette he observed that an
editor ought to possess a great Easiness and Command of Writing and
Relating Things clearly and intelligibly and in few Wordsi Good
writing in Franklins opinion should proceed regularly from things
known to things unknown surely the method of all inductive reasoning
and science distinctly and clearly without confusion The words used
should be the most expressive that the language affords provided that
they are the most generally understood Nothing should be expressed in
two words that can be as well expressed in one that is no synonyms
should be used or very rarely but the whole should be as short as
possible consistent with clearness the words should be so placed as to
be agreeable to the ear in reading summarily it should be smooth
clear and short for the contrary qualities are displeasingi
Like the members of the Royal Society Franklin would bring the words of
written discourse as near as possible to the spokeni In  he
observed If my Hypothesis concerning waterspouts is not the Truth
itself it is at least as naked For I have not with some of our
learned Moderns disguisd my Nonsense in Greek clothd it in Algebra
or adornd it with Fluxions You have it in puris naturalibusi
He briefly summarized his rhetorical ideal in a letter to Hume In
writings intended for persuasion and for general information one
cannot be too clear and every expression in the least obscure is a
faulti

Unlike Jefferson no friend to what is called purism but a zealous
one to neology Franklin had an inveterate antipathy toward the use of
colloquialisms provincialisms and extravagant innovationsi In
another letter to Hume he hoped that we shall always in America make
the best English of this Island Britain our standardi If he
did not hold the typical eighteenthcentury view that English must be
subjected to a process of classical regularizingi neither did
he with his friend Joseph Priestley espouse the idea of correctness
dependent only on usage In general he seems to have had a tendency
toward purism it is not unlikely that as a youth he was influenced by
Swifts Proposal for Correcting Improving and Ascertaining the
English Tonguei Striving for correctness and the avoidance of
affected Words or highflown Phrasesi he approximated the
curiosa felicitas of the neoclassicistsi

A solid neoclassicisti in style Franklin accepted the canon of
imitation as it was imperfectly understood in the eighteenth century To
the extent however that the models were conceived of as approximating
the consensus gentium fragments illustrating universal reason there
may be little disparity between neoclassic imitation and Aristotles use
of the term in the sense of imitating a higher ethical reality His own
life Franklin thought with the exception of a few errata was fit
to be imitatedi A H Smyth notes perhaps extravagantly
Nothing but the Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini or the
Confessions of Rousseau can enter into competition with iti
This may suggest a clue to the durable nature of Franklins lifetale
Cellini it is true was tremendously alive to Benvenuto even as Michel
de Montaigne was interested in his own whims but neither Cellini nor
Montaigne nor Franklin could have penned the Confessions the thesis
of which is that if Rousseau is not better than other men at least he is
different Cellini Montaigne and Franklin on the other hand while
allowing us to see their fancies and singular biases tended to
emphasize those qualities which they held in common with their age
nation and even the continuity of mankind Montaigne it will be
remembered sought to express la connaissance de lhomme en gnral
With no aspirations to become an original genius Franklin both in his
prose style and his yearning for perfection sought the guidance of
models which he conceived as embodying universal reason Had he been a
writer of epicsi he would with Pope have acquired from ancient
rules a just esteemwhen the rules were in his mind according to
nature

Likewise Franklin is representative of the Enlightenment in his
description of the province of the imagination It is an axiom that the
belief that the imagination ought to be kept in check by reason
pervades the critical literature of the first half of the eighteenth
centuryi Franklin observes that poetasters above all need
instruction on how to govern Fancy Imagination with
Judgementi He implies that imagination is a power lending an air
of unreality to a creation often like the Effect of some melancholy
Humouri He feared that the unchecked fancy would vitiate his
ideals of simplicity and correctness and a sober and practical
argument

Posing as no original genius independent of the wisdom of the
agesi confessing that from a child he was fond of reading and
that as a youth reading was the only amusement he allowed himself
Franklin was not backward in cataloguing many of the authors who helped
to motivate his thought He seems to have been acquainted with portions
of Plato Aesop Pliny Xenophon Herodotus Epictetus Vergil Horace
Tacitus Seneca Sallust Cicero Tully Milton Jeremy Taylor Bacon
Dryden Tillotson Rabelaisi Bunyan Fnelon Chevalier de
Ramsayi Pythagoras Waller Defoe Addison and Steele William
Temple Pope Swift Voltaire Boyle Algernon Sidney Trenchard and
Gordoni Young Mandeville Locke Shaftesbury Collins
Bolingbroke Richardson Whiston Watts Thomson Burke Cowper Darwin
Rowe Rapin Herschel Paley Lord Kames Adam Smith Hume Robertson
Lavoisier Buffon Dupont de Nemours Whitefield Pemberton Blackmore
John Ray Petty Turgot Priestley Paine Mirabeau Quesnay Raynal
Morellet and Condorcet to suggest only the more prominenti Such
a catalogue tends to discredit the all too common idea that the
untutored tradesman was torpid to the information and wisdom found in
books

If his prose style shows none of the delicate rhythms and haunting
imagery of the prose born of the romantic movement it is nevertheless
far from pedestrian If it seems devoid of imaginative splendor it is
not lacking in force and persuasioni After one has noted
Franklins canon of simplicity and order his insistence on
correctness his assumed role as Censor Morum his acceptance of the
doctrine of imitation and the use of imagination guided by reason one
returns to the question of the degree to which the ideals of rhetoric
fostered by the men of science may have helped to motivate Franklins
prose style and to what degree his acceptance of deism augmented by
Newtonianism may have furnished him with a rationale which lent sanction
to his demand for a simple style

Sir Humphrey Davy found in Franklins scientific papers a language lucid
and decorous almost as worthy of admiration as the doctrinei
they contain S G Fisher buoyantly maintained that Franklins is the
most effective literary style ever used by an American After reading
Franklins paper on stoves he was inclined to lay down the principle
that the test of literary genius is the ability to be fascinating about
stovesi Whether he writes soberly albeit tempered by Gallic
fancy of the mutability of life as in The Ephemera or of
sophisticated social amenities as in the letters to Madame Brillon and
Madame Helvtius or in his memoirs in which solid fact follows solid
fact sifted by the years of good fortune Franklins style never loses
its compelling charm and vigor If he never wrote or uttered less than
was demanded by the nature of his subject neither would he have
disgusted the Clerk of Oxenford who

    Nought o word spak he more than was nede

He was no formal literary critic such as Boileau Lessing or Coleridge
and no acknowledged arbiter of taste such as Dr Johnson Yet Franklin
in voluminous practice enjoying tremendous international vogue proved
that his theories bore the acid test of effectiveness Indirectly he
challenged his readers to honor principles of rhetoric which could so
trenchantly serve the demands of his catholic pen and make him one of
the most widely read of all Americans



IV FRANKLIN AS PRINTER AND JOURNALIST

Franklin was a printer chiefly because of two proclivities which were
basic in his personality from childhood to old agea bent toward
practical mechanics handiness and a fondness for reading
bookishness Further he was a journalist and publisher chiefly
because he was a printer

A thorough printer is both an artisan and an artist he has both the
manual dexterity of a good workman and the aesthetic appreciation of the
amateur of beauty Franklin always took pride in his ability to handle
the printers tools from the time when at the age of twelve he became
a useful handi in the print shop of his brother James until the
very end of his life One of the pleasantest anecdotes of the old
printer is that which tells of his visit to the famous Didot printing
establishment in Paris when he stepped up to a press and motioning the
printer aside himself took possession of the machine and printed off
several sheets Then the American ambassador smiled at the gaping
printers and said Do not be astonished Sirs it is my former
businessi

Even in his boyhood it was a pleasure to Franklin to see good workmen
handle their tools and he tells in his autobiography how much this
feeling for tools meant to him throughout his lifei His flair for
invention though founded on this same handiness was not always
directed toward the production of tools but in the two fields of
philosophical experimentation and the printing trade his dexterity
and cleverness in making needful instruments and devices were
invaluable

Partly because of the fact that printers supplies must be imported from
England and partly because of his natural toolmindedness Franklin
manufactured more of his own supplies than any other American commercial
printer before or since He cast type made paper molds mixed inks
made contributions to press building did engraving forwarded
experiments in stereotyping and worked at logotypy Long after he had
retired from the printing business Franklin continued to influence
developments in that field It is a common saying among printers that
one never forgets the smell of printers ink Franklin kept touch with
his former business through various partnerships through correspondence
with printer friends through the establishment of a private press in
his home at Passy during his ambassadorship to France and through his
personal supervision of the education of his grandson in the art
preservative of arts I am too old to follow printing again myself
he wrote to a friend but loving the business I have brought up my
grandson Benjamin to it and have built and furnished a printinghouse
for him which he now manages under my eyei

As to just how adept Franklin was on the distinctively aesthetic side of
printing critics must differ It has been customary to assume that the
output of his shop was far superior to that of the several other
printing houses in the coloniesi Such broad generalizations are
misleading however and it is certainly possible to find Parks and
even Bradford imprints which compare favorably enough with some of
Franklins In typography the phase of printing which affords the
widest aesthetic scope Franklin was by no means a genius William
Parks of Annapolis and later of Williamsburg was at least Franklins
peer during the seventeenthirties and forties in the artistic
arrangement of type and William Goddard who practiced the art a little
later in several of the colonies was his superior Yet Franklin was an
outstanding printer in a region blessed with few good presses The
difference between him and most of the other colonial printers may be
stated thus Franklin maintained a high average of workmanlike though
not inspired performance while his contemporaries were inclined to be
slovenly inaccurate and generally careless

In the later years of his life Franklin gave no little attention to fine
printing though as a dilettante rather than as a commercial printer In
France he was friendly with Franois Ambroise Didot the greatest French
printer of his times and put his grandson Benjamin Franklin Bache to
school in Didots establishment With Pierre Simon Fournier who ranked
next to Didot among French printers Franklin corresponded from time to
time In England the American printer maintained touch with prominent
practitioners of his craft from the time of his first visit abroad until
his death Samuel Palmer Franklins first London employer was but a
mediocre printer but John Watts to whose house the young American went
after a year at Palmers stood much higher in his vocationi Both
Watts and Palmer were patrons of William Caslon from whom Franklin
later bought type But John Baskerville Caslons rival was the founder
whom Franklin did most to encourage and to bring to the attention of
discriminating printers The English printer with whom Franklin was upon
the terms of greatest intimacyand that for many yearswas William
Strahan member of Parliament Kings Printer and a successful
publisher Strahan was a man of parts a great letter writer and a
friend of David Hume and Samuel Johnson The latter referred to the
Strahan shop as the greatest printing house in Londoni Another
correspondent was John Walter logotyper press builder and founder of
the London Timesi In all his letters to his printer friends
Franklin shows not only a lively interest in improvements and inventions
for the trade but also an increasing interest in the artistic side of
printing and typefounding

The bookish inclination which Franklin credits in the Autobiography
with being the quality that decided his father to make a printer of him
appertained to the trade because printers were commonly publishers and
sellers of books and pamphlets and often editors and publishers of
newspapers How the young Franklin satisfied his literary urge in the
print shop of his brother James is a familiar story and his theories of
writing are traced in another section of this Introduction The
contribution to literature which he made as a publisher of original
books is negligible but he did his part both as publisher and
bookseller to spread that bookishness to which he felt that he owed much
of his own success Like all publishers before and since he was forced
by his customers to issue books of a lower sort than he could fully
approve in order to float editions of more desirable works he tells
plaintively of his publics preference for Robin Hoods Songs over the
Psalms of his beloved Wattsi In still another way Franklin
promoted the bookishness of his community he founded the first of
American circulating libraries and he built up for himself one of the
largest private libraries in the countryi

Journalism was a common byproduct of the printing trade When Franklin
and Meredith took over Keimers The Universal Instructor in all Arts
and Sciences and Pennsylvania Gazette in  there were six other
newspapers being published in the coloniesthree in Boston and one each
in New York Philadelphia and Annapolis The Williamsburg press had a
newspaper a few years later but the other two printing towns in the
colonies had to wait some thirty years for journalistic venturesa
newspaper in New London and a magazine in Woodbridgei

The fundamental question to be asked in analyzing a newspaper may be
stated thus What is the editorial conception of the primary function of
the press Franklin had received his early newspaper training on his
brothers New England Courant which frankly acknowledged
entertainment as its primary function and relegated news to a minor
place Of his contemporaries in  the oldest the Boston
NewsLetter held the publication of news to be its sole function
while the Boston Gazette the New York Gazette and the Maryland
Gazette took much the same attitude In the main they were rather
dreary reprints of stale European news Bradfords American Weekly
Mercury in Philadelphia gave somewhat more attention to local news
but with the exception of the FranklinBreintnal BusyBody papers
contributed in  in order to bring Keimer to his knees the
Mercury gave very little attention to the entertainment function Only
the New England Weekly Journal carrying on something of the tradition
of the old Courant dealt largely in entertainment as well as in news
This bifunctional policy was the one adopted by Franklins
Pennsylvania Gazette which was always readable and amusing at the
same time that it was newsy

Of the editorial or opinionforming function of newspapers there was
little evidence in Franklins paperi at least in the field of
politics The obvious reason was the active governmental censorship It
remained for John Peter Zenger to introduce that function into colonial
journalism in the New York Weekly Journal in  his struggle for
the freedom of the press is well knowni But the Pennsylvania
Gazette never became in any degree a political organ while Franklin
edited it and his first political pronouncement was published not in
his paper but in a pamphlet Plain Truth issued just before his
retirement from editorial duties

Two common misconceptions in regard to Franklins newspaper call for
correction  The Pennsylvania Gazette was not connected as
forerunner or ancestor with the Saturday Evening Post The Gazette
a newspaper to the end closed its file in i the Post a
story paper issued its Volume I Number  in  Throughout much of
the latter half of the nineteenth century the Post carried the legend
Founded in  on its front page and not until after the Curtis
Publishing Company bought it in  did it begin to print the words
Founded AD  by Benjamin Franklin on its cover The sole
connection of the Post with Franklin lies in the fact that it was
first issued from an office at  Market Street which Franklin had once
occupiedi  Franklin did not publish a chain of newspapers A
chain implies some kind of cooperative connection between the various
members but the several papers which Franklin helped to finance had no
such relationship In some he was a sixyears partneri keeping
his interest until the resident publisher usually a former employee
was established to some he made loans or in the case of relatives
giftsi

One of his journalistic ventures which is not mentioned in the
Autobiography is the General Magazine of  It missed by three
days being the first of American magazines Andrew Bradford had learned
of Franklins project and with his American Magazine beat him in the
race for priority But the American Magazine was a failure in three
monthly numbers while Franklins periodical though more readable died
after its sixth issuei As an initial episode in the history of
American magazines the General Magazine has a certain eminence but
Franklins neglect of it when writing his Autobiography after the
events of nearly fifty busy years had apparently crowded it out of his
memory is sufficient commentary on its unimportance

To the end of his life Franklin was proud of his trade of printing with
its handmaiden journalism His last will and testament begins I
Benjamin Franklin Printer Though clearly not the chief interest of
his life it was one to which he was fundamentally and consistently
attached



V FRANKLINS ECONOMIC VIEWS

An eighteenthcentury colonial who wrote on paper money interest
value and insurance who discussed a theory of population and the
economic aspects of the abolition of slavery who championed free trade
and who probably lent Adam Smith some information used in his Wealth of
Nations who was an empirical agriculturist who was half physiocratic
before the rise of the physiocratic schoolsuch a colonial has
indeed claims to being Americas pioneer economist

Franklins hatred of negro slavery was conditioned by more than his
humanitarian bias It may be seen that his indictments of black cargoes
were the resultant of an interplay of his convictions that economically
slavery was enervating and dear and of his abstract sense of religious
and ethical justice One should not minimize however his distrust of
slavery on other than economic bases He was acutely influenced by the
Quakers of his colony who like gadflies were stinging slaveholders to
an awareness of their blood traffic and by the rise of English
humanitarianism In his youth he had published first edition 
second  with no little danger to himself and his business Ralph
Sandifords A Brief Examination of the Practice of the Times an
Amoslike vituperative attack on the unrighteous Gain of slaveholding
He also published works of Benjamin Lay and John Woolmani Friend
of Anthony Benezet Benjamin Rush Fothergill and Granville Sharp and
after  a member of Dr Brays Associates he lent his voice and pen
to denouncing slavery on religious and ethical grounds and in England
after the James Sommersett trial  he began to agitate for
parliamentary action toward the abolishing of slavery in all parts of
the British Empirei Following the Sommersett verdict Franklin
contributed a brief article to the London Chronicle June  
in which he denounced the constant butchery of the human species by
this pestilential detestable traffic in the bodies and souls of
meni Losing his temperamental urbanity when observing the
diabolical Commercei the abominable African Trade he
recollects approvingly that a certain French moralisti could not
look on a piece of sugar without conceiving it stained with spots of
human bloodi Conditioned by Quakerism by his deism which
suggested that the most acceptable Service we render him God is doing
good to his other Children and by the eighteenth centurys growing
repugnance toward suffering and paini Franklin although he took
little part in legislating against slavery in Pennsylvania became
through his writing a model to be imitated especially in France by a
people more intent on becoming humane than saintly

His letter to Anthony Benezet London July   however clearly
indicates that for economic as well as humanitarian reasons he had
sought freedom for slaves

    I am glad to hear that such humane Sentiments prevail so much
    more generally than heretofore that there is Reason to hope
    our Colonies may in time get clear of a Practice that
    disgraces them and without producing any equivalent
    Benefit is dangerous to their very Existencei

Franklins view of the economic disabilities of slavery is best
expressed in Observations Concerning the Increase of Mankind Peopling
of Countries Etc  Arguing against British restraint of
colonial manufactures he observed that tis an illgrounded Opinion
that by the Labour of slaves America may possibly vie in Cheapness of
Manufactures with Britain The Labour of Slaves can never be so cheap
here as the Labour of working Men is in Britaini With
arithmetic based on empirical scrutiny of existing conditions
resembling the mode of economists following Adam Smith he charged that
slaves are economically unprofitable due to the rate of interest in the
colonies their initial price their insurance and maintenance their
negligence and malevolencei In addition Slaves  pejorate the
Families that use them the white Children become proud disgusted with
Labour and being educated in Idleness are rendered unfit to get a
Living by Industryi Slaves are hardly economical investments in
terms of colonial character Looking to the English Sugar Islands
where Negroes have greatly diminishd the Whites and deprived the
poor of employment while a few Families acquire vast Estates he
realized that population was limited by means of subsistencei
which foreshadowed the more pessimistic progressions of Malthus Having
just maintained that our People must at least be doubled every 
Yearsi and intuitively suspecting that the means for subsistence
progress more slowly he exclaimed Why increase the Sons of Africa
by planting them in America where we have so fair an Opportunity by
excluding all Blacks and Tawneys of increasing the lovely White and
Redi He saw mere economic extravagance as the shorttime effect
of slavery he feared that the longtime effect would be to create an
aristocracy subsisting at the head of a vast brood of slaves and poor
whitesi

It was inevitable in a state having no staple crop such as rice sugar
tobacco or cotton which offered at least economic justification for
negro slavery that abolition of slaves should be urged partially on
purely economic grounds and that Pennsylvania should have been the
first colony to legislate in favor of abolition in  Although one
may feel that economic determinism is overly simple and audacious in its
doctrinaire interpretations one can not refuse to see the extent to
which economics tended to buttress humane and religious factors in
Franklins mind to make him a persuasive champion of abolitioni

A Modest Enquiry into the Nature and Necessity of a Paper
Currencyi has been appraised as by far the ablest and most
original treatise that had been written on the subject up to  and
was probably the most widely read work on paper currency that appeared
in colonial Americai That Franklins interest in paper money was
not unique one may gather from the fact that between  and 
nearly thirty pamphlets appeared on this subject in Massachusetts
alonei One of the  theses at Harvard answered in the
affirmative was Does the issue of paper money contribute to the
public goodi Since there was a scarcity of circulating medium
caused by the constant drain of specie for export explains Mr D R
Dewey it is not strange that projects for converting credit into
wealth should have sprung up in the coloniesi Franklin argued in
his Modest Enquiryi that  A plentiful Currency will occasion
Interest to be low  it will occasion the Trading Produce to bear a
good Price  it will encourage great Numbers of labouring and
Handicrafts Men to come and settle in the Country and  it will
occasion a less consumption of European Goods in proportion to the
Number of the People Thus he saw paper money as a Morrisons Pill
promising to cure all economic illsi It has been suggested that
as a printer Franklin naturally would favor issues of paper money In
view of his later apostasy one should note that in this essay Franklin
apparently accepted the current mercantilist notions best expressed
here in his conviction that paper money will secure a favorable balance
of trade Demands for emissions of paper money were inevitable in a
colony in the grip of such a restrictive commercial policy as British
mercantilism It must be observed however that Franklin differed from
the proper mercantilists to the extent that simple valuable metals were
not to be measures of value Deriving his idea from Sir William Petty
Franklin took labor as the true measure of valueia position
later held by Karl Marx In his preoccupation with the growth of
manufactures and favorable balances of trade Franklin gave no
suggestions that at least by  he was to become an exponent of
agrarianism and free trade One wonders to what extent his warnings
against the purchase of unnecessary Householdstuff or any superfluous
thing his inveterate emphasis on industry and frugality were
conditioned by his view that such indulgence would essentially cause a
preponderance of imports hence casting against them an unfavorable
trade balancei

In  Parliament passed an act regulating in the New England colonies
the issue of paper money and preventing them from adding a legal tender
clause thereto in  Parliament forbade issue of legal tender money
in any of the colonies As a member of the Pennsylvania assembly
Franklin had successfully sponsored issues of paper money in London
following the  act he urged that one of the causes breeding
disrespect for Parliament was the prohibition of making paper money
among usi Economics blends into politics when we remember that
the  restraining legislation was one of the factors in the
subsequent separation for it caused some of the suffering that
inevitably follows in the wake of an unsound monetary policy whose
onward course is suddenly checkedi In  Franklin was yet an
ardent imperialist who sought politically and economically to keep
whole that fine and noble China Vase the British Empire His Remarks
and Facts Concerning American Paper Money  in answer to Lord
Hillsboroughs Board of Trade report circulated among British merchants
is an ardent plea for legal tender paper money He argued that British
merchants since yearly trade balances had regularly been in their
favor had not been deprived of gold and silver that paper money had
worked in the Coloniesi and that British merchants had lost no
more in their colonial dealings than was inevitable in war times
Franklin concluded that since there were no mines in the colonies paper
money was a necessity arguing here very shrewdly that even English
silver is obliged to the legal Tender for Part of its Value Hence
at least for colonies deserving it the mother country should take off
the restraint on legal tender What Franklin seems not to have known and
what the merchants had actually felt they had their accounts staring at
them was that in the past especially after  much of the legal
tender was in effect nothing but inconvertible fiat money Mr Carey
quotes from an uncollected item Franklins The Legal Tender of Paper
Money in America in which he threatened that if the colonies were not
allowed to issue legaltender notes there was no way in which they could
retain hard money except by boycotting English goodsi Franklin
suggested to S Cooper April   that depreciation may not be
unmixed evil since it may be viewed as a tax It should always be
remembered that the original Intention was to sink the Bills by Taxes
which would as effectually extinguish the Debt as an actual
Redemptioni Not a little Machiavellian for one who was not blind
to the sanctity of contracts

With the Revolution and the attendant depreciation in currency Franklin
tended to warn against overissuesi Like Governor Hutchinson who
said that the morals of the people depreciate with the currency
Franklin confessed in  the many Mischiefs the injustices the
Corruption of Manners c c that attended a depreciating
Currencyi There is no evidence to show that Franklin dissented
from the conservative prohibition in the Constitutional Convention of
 against issues of legal tender paperi

Deborah Logan in a letter in  stated that Franklin once told Dr
Logan that the celebrated Adam Smith when writing his Wealth of
Nations was in the habit of bringing chapter after chapter as he
composed it to himself Dr Price and others of the literati then
patiently hear sic their observations and profit by their
discussion and criticismeven sometimes submitting to write whole
chapters anew and even to reverse some of his propositionsi
James Parton observed that the allusions to the colonies which
constitute the experimental evidence of the essential truth of the
book were supplied by Franklini But Rae reasonably counters It
ought of course to be borne in mind that Smith had been in the constant
habit of hearing much about the American Colonies and their affairs
during his thirteen years in Glasgow from the intelligent merchants and
returned planters of that cityi

In general we may conclude that Franklin and Smith were exponents of
free trade in proportion as they were reactionaries against British
mercantilism Each in his reaction tended to elevate the function of
agriculture beyond reasonable limits Unlike the physiocrats and
Franklin however Adam Smith did not hold that in terms of
wealthproducing manufacturers were sterile Even if Franklin saw only
agriculture as productive he was not blind to the utility of
manufactures especially after the break with the mother country when
he realized that home industry must be developed to supply the colonial
needs formerly satisfied by British exportsi

Finally each was in varying degrees an exponent of laissez
fairei Since we shall discover that politically Franklin was less
a democrat than is often supposed we may feel that his belief in free
trade led him to embrace reservedly the principle of laissez faire
rather than that free trade an economic concept was but a fragment of
a larger dogma namely that government should be characterized by its
passivity frugality and maximum negligence V L Parrington
quotesi from George Whatelys Principles of Trade which
contained views congenial to Franklin

    When Colbert assembled some wise old merchants of France and
    desired their advice and opinion how he could best serve and
    promote commerce their answer after consultation was in
    three words only Laisseznous faire Let us alone It is
    said by a very solid writer of the same nation that he is
    well advanced in the science of politics who knows the full
    force of that maxim Pas trop gouverner Not to govern too
    much which perhaps would be of more use when applied to
    trade than in any other public concern Present editors
    italics

Laissez faire in Franklins as in Whatelys view tended to be synonymous
with free trade Laissez faire was suggested by his insistence on free
trade as he progressively expressed his antipathy for mercantilism
rather than that free trade was simply a natural deduction from a more
inclusive economicpolitical dogma

Writing to the procolonial Jonathan Shipley Bishop of St Asaph whose
sweet Retirement at Twyford he had long enjoyed Franklin seeing no
hopes of a reconciliation between the colonies and Great Britain
uttered what marked him as the first American disciple of Quesnays
school of economic thought Agriculture is the great Source of Wealth
and Plenty By cutting off our Trade you have thrown us to the Earth
whence like Antaeus we shall rise yearly with fresh Strength and
Vigouri Upon learning of the colonists Resolutions of
NonImportation he wrote to Cousin Folger that they must promote
their own industries especially those of the Earth and their Sea the
true Sources of Wealth and Plentyi Learning that the colonists
had threatened to boycott English manufacturers by creating their own
basic industries Franklin demurred in a letter to Cadwallader Evans
Agriculture is truly productive of new wealth manufacturers only
change forms and whatever value they give to the materials they work
upon they in the mean time consume an equal value in provisions c So
that riches are not increased by manufacturing the only advantage is
that provisions in the shape of manufactures are more easily carried for
sale to foreign marketsi Positions to be Examined Concerning
National Wealthi affords a succinct statement of Franklins
agrarianism There seem to be but three ways for a nation to acquire
wealth The first is by war as the Romans did in plundering their
conquered neighbours This is robbery The second by commerce which
is generally cheating The third by agriculture the only honest
way wherein man receives a real increase of the seed thrown into the
ground in a kind of continual miracle wrought by the hand of God in
his favour as a reward for his innocent life and his virtuous
industryi Dupont de Nemours as early as  had written Who
does not know that the English have today their Benjamin Franklin who
has adopted the principles and the doctrines of our French
economistsi Before attempting to appraise the real indebtedness
of Franklin to the physiocrats it is well to seek to learn how he came
in contact with their ideas and especially why by the year  he was
acutely susceptible to their doctrine In the summer of  in the
company of Sir John Pringle Franklin went to Paris not an unknown
figure to the French savants who were acquainted with his scientific
papers already translated into French by DAlibard That he was feted by
the Newtons of the physiocrats Franois Quesnay and the elder Mirabeau
as le Savant le Geomtre le Physicien lhomme  qui la nature permet
de dvoiler ses secretsi we are assured when to De Nemours
July   he writes regretfully Be so good as to present my
sincere respect to that venerable apostle Dr Quesnay and to the
illustrious Ami des Hommes of whose civilities to me at Paris I retain
a grateful remembrancei Having missed Franklin in Paris
 De Nemours had sent Franklin un recueil des principaux traits
conomiques du Docteur Quesnay and his own Physiocratie  which
cast him in the role of a propagandist of Physiocratie
doctrinesi Franklin admitted I am perfectly charmed with them
and wish I could have stayed in France for some time to have studied
in your school that I might by conversing with its founders have made
myself quite a master of that philosophyi That Franklin was not
before  unacquainted with the conomistes we learn when he tells
Dupont de Nemours that Dr Templeman had shown him the De
NemoursTempleman correspondence when the latter was Secretary of the
London Society for the Encouragement of Arts Manufactures and
Commerce A second trip to Paris in  to confer with Barbeu
Dubourg an avowed physiocrat concerning his forthcoming translation of
Franklins works served to acquaint him still further with the
doctrines of the new school

Franklins agrarianismi is congruent with physiocracyi in as
far as he observed that agriculture alone of the many industries
produced a surplus of wealth after all of the expenses of production had
been paidi Each laborer produced more than enough to satisfy his
own needs This surplus the conomistes termed the produit net A
worker in manufactures it was assumed consumed foodstuffs and other
materials in proportion to the value he created in his manufacturing
process Hence there obviously could be no produit net accruing from
manufactures Like the physiocrats Franklin felt that manufactures were
sterile to the extent that no new wealth was created The physiocrats
believed however that laborers in manufacturing industries could
create a produit net if they stinted themselves in consuming
foodstuffs et cetera but it was argued that this prudential asceticism
was not a characteristic habit To this extent at least the physiocrats
were empirical

Free trade no less than agrarianism characterized physiocracy Although
Franklin indicated his antagonism toward governmental restraint of
trade internal and among nations in his antipathy toward British
mercantilism it was not until after he became impregnated with French
doctrine that he began to express very fully his advocacy of free trade
After Connecticut imposed a  duty on goods imported from neighboring
colonies Franklin wrote to Jared Eliot in  that it was likely that
the duty would devolve on the consumer and be only another mode of
Taxing the purchaser In addition he recognized that smuggling
virtually a colonial art would cause the fair Trader to be undersold
and ruinedi He urged that the import duty might suggest
selfishness and might also tend to deter Connecticut commerce Here it
must be admitted Franklin did not sanction free trade with a priori
appeals to the natural order the key in the arch of physiocracy He
rather appealed to the instincts and observations of the prudential
tradesman His Plan for Regulating Indian Affairs  unlike his
 letters suggested if it did not express concretely inviolable
laws of commerce in the words It seems contrary to the Nature of
Commerce for Government to interfere in the Prices of Commodities
It therefore seems to me that Trade will best find and make its own
Rates and that Government cannot well interfere unless it would take
the whole Trade into its own hands  and manage it by its own Servants
at its own Risquei To Dupont de Nemours he admitted that British
mercantilism had not achieved that wisdom which sees the welfare of the
parts in the prosperity of the wholei To Sir Edward Newenham
representing the County of Dublin he expressed admiration for Irish
efforts to secure freedom of commerce which is the right of all
mankind To enjoy all the advantages of the climate soil and
situation in which God and nature have placed us is as clear a right as
that of breathing and can never be justly taken from men but as a
punishment for some atrocious crimei Three years before he met
Quesnay though after he had read Dupont de Nemourss letters to
Templeman Franklin sanctioned free trade through appeal to other than
utilitarian prudence first he admitted that British restraint of
colonial commerce for example with the West Indies will tend to
prevent colonists from making remittances for British manufactured
goods since The Cat can yield but her skin Then with a suggestion of
philosophic generalization he hoped that In time perhaps Mankind may be
wise enough to let Trade take its own Course find its own Channels and
regulate its own Proportions etci Restraint of manufactures
deprives us of the Advantage God  Nature seem to have intended
us So selfish is the human Mind But tis well there is One above
that rules these Matters with a more equal Hand He that is pleasd to
feed the Ravens will undoubtedly take care to prevent a Monopoly of the
Carrioni Glorifying the husbandman and suggesting that trade
restrictions disturb a natural order Franklin wrote to David Hartley in
 that Great Britain has tended to impede the mutual communications
among men of the gifts of God and rendering miserable multitudes of
merchants and their families artisans and cultivators of the earth
the most peaceable and innocent part of the human speciesi

That Franklin was not without his influence in eighteenthcentury
economic thought we may gather from Dugald Stewarts opinion that the
expressions laissezfaire and pas trop gouverner are indebted
chiefly for their extensive circulation to the short and luminous
comments of Franklin which had so extraordinary an influence on public
opinion in the old and new worldi Mr Carey maintains that
Franklin unlike the physiocrats inveighed against trade regulations
because they led to smuggling rather than because to any important
degree they violated the natural order The physiocrats are tenuous
amorphous and ambiguous when they seek to define LOrdre naturel At
times Dupont de Nemours seems to identify it with a primitivistic
pasti Quesnay on the other hand says Natural right is
indeterminate in a state of nature The right only appears when justice
and labour have been establishedi Again he asserts By
entering society and making conventions for their mutual advantage men
increase the scope of natural right without incurring any restriction of
their liberties for this is just the state of things that enlightened
reason would have choseni Natural order is a providential
order Its laws are irrevocable pertaining as they do to the essence
of matter and the soul of humanity They are just the expression of the
will of Godi According to the physiocrats the laws of the
natural order are unique eternal invariable and universali
Now it is true that nowhere did Franklin assert that his advocacy of
laissez faire and agrarianism was neatly dependent on these a priori
bases Even though this is true there are references quoted above
which seem to suggest that trade restrictions are violations of the very
nature of things It is not wholly fanciful bearing in mind Franklins
adoration of a Deity who is the creator and sustainer of immutable
universal physical laws which together present the mind with the concept
of a vast wonderfully harmonized physical machine to conjecture to
what extent this matchless physical harmony tended to challenge him with
the possibility of discovering a parallel economic machine operating
according to immutable laws capable of proof and human adaptability

O H Taylor has shown that The evolution of the idea of laws in
economics has closely paralleled its evolution in the natural
sciencesi In searching for these economic constants the
economic mechanism was regarded as a wise device of the Creator for
causing individuals while pursuing only their own interests to promote
the prosperity of society and for causing the right adjustment to one
another of supplies demand prices and incomes to take place
automatically in consequence of the free action of all
individualsi After giving due weight to the fact that Franklin
saw in the doctrine of the physiocrats trenchant arguments to buttress
his attacks on British mercantilism one has cogent evidence for at
least raising the question To what extent may his apprehension of a
demonstrable physical harmony have suggested to his speculative mind an
economic analogyi



VI FRANKLINS POLITICAL THEORIES

Plague of the Pennsylvania proprietaries propagandist of the American
Revolution moderator of the Constitutional Convention Franklin was all
through his life a politician and statesman in an age characterized
above all by political speculations and changes in the destiny of
states Colonial patriot arch rebel of King George III idol of the
court of Versailles Franklin was a cyclopedia of political strategy
and principles Only through a genetic survey of Franklin the political
theorist can one hope to understand his mind as he changed from
imperialist to revolutionist to the patriarch of the Constitutional
Convention who like a balance wheel moderated the extreme party
factions

In the early s Franklin had breathed a Boston air saturated with
discontent between the royal governor and the governed By  he was
printer to the Pennsylvania Assembly and in  was appointed clerk to
that body Yet one learns little of his political biases until 
when he published Plain Truth In  he genially asserted that he
was no Partymani and in  temperately stated

    Free from the bitter Rage of Party Zeal
    All those we love who seek the publick Weali

His Plain Truth November  directed against the proprietary
governor as well as against the Quaker assembly showed Franklin a party
man only if one dedicated to the publick weal was a party man With
all respect for the Quaker conscience which checks military activity
Franklin could not however condone its virtually prohibiting others
from defending the provinces border And the proprietaries had shown
an inveterate unwillingness to arm Pennsylvaniaa reluctance which did
not however prevent them from collecting taxes and quitrents On other
questions the governor and his chiefs had to contend with the opposition
of the assembly Without opposition the proprietary government could
serenely kennel itself in its medieval privilege of remaining dumb to an
urgent need one remembers that eighteenthcentury proprietary colonies
were essentially feudal principalities upon the grantees of which were
bestowed all the inferior regalities and subordinate powers of
legislation which formerly belonged to the counts palatine while
provision was also made for the maintenance of sovereignty in the king
the king paid little attention to Pennsylvania and for the
realization of the objects of the granti While the government
remained inert Pennsylvania would be a pawn in the steeled hands of the
French and their rumsubsidized Indian mercenaries Appealing to
Scripture and common sense Franklin pleaded for Order Discipline and
a few Cannoni Not untruthfully he warned that we are like the
separate Filaments of Flax before the Thread is formd without
Strength because without Connection but UNION would make us strong
and even formidablei Since war existed there was no need to
consider him a militarist because he challenged The Way to secure
Peace is to be prepared for Wari In the midst of Plain Truth
Franklin uttered what only before the time of Locke could be
interpreted in terms of feudal comitatus he entreated his readers to
consider if not as Friends at least as Legislators that Protection
is as truly due from the Government to the People as Obedience from
the People to the Governmenti Suggestive of the contract theory
this is revolutionary only in a very elementary way With the French
writhing under the Treaty of Paris with appeals to natural rights and
the right of revolution this once harmless principle took on Gargantuan
significance But Thomas Penn anticipated wisely enough the ultimate
implication of Franklins paper Penn intuitively saw the march of time
Mr Franklins doctrine that obedience to governors is no more due them
than protection to the people is not fit to be in the heads of the
unthinking multitude He is a dangerous man and I should be glad if he
inhabited any other country as I believe him of a very uneasy spirit
However as he is a sort of tribune of the people he must be treated
with regardi It is difficult to see how Franklins passion for
order and provincial unioni obviously necessary could have been
considered so illiberally subversive of the government By  Franklin
had read in Telemachus that kings exist for the people not the people
for the kings he must have read Lockes justification of the Glorious
Revolution and have become aware of the impetus it gave to the British
authority of consent in its subsequent constitutional history

After his first political pamphlet he widened his horizon from
provincial to colonial affairs Two years before the London Board of
Trade demanded that colonial governors hold a conference with the
Iroquois Franklin seems to have devised plans for uniting the several
colonies He was aware of the narrow particularism shown by the
provinces he knew also that since Governors are often on ill Terms
with their Assemblies no concerted military efforts could be achieved
without a military federationi One remembers that as soon as he
could think politically he was an imperialist a lesser William Pitt
and in his Increase of Mankind  could gloat over an envisioned
thickly populated AmericaWhat an Accession of Power to the British
Empire by Sea as well as Landi When the Board of Trade after
British efforts to bring the colonies together had failed demanded that
something be done Franklin was appointed one of the commissioners to
meet at Albany in  Like Franklin Governor Glen had admitted that
the colonies were a Rope of Sand  loose and inconnectedi
Franklins plan adopted by the commissioners called for a
GovernorGeneral appointed by the king and a Grand Council made up of
members chosen by the Assembly of each of the colonies the Governor to
have a negation on all acts of the Grand Council and carry into
execution whatever is agreed on by him and that Councili Surely
not a very auspicious beginning for one who later was to favor the
legislative over the executive functions of state The plan included the
powers of making Indian treaties of peace and war of regulating Indian
trade and Indian purchases of stimulating the settling of new lands of
making laws to govern new areas of raising soldiers of laying general
duties et ceterai But Franklin did not minimize the lack of
cohesion of the colonies We recollect that in  at a time when
their very existence was threatened by the French Massachusetts and New
York engaged in a bitter boundary controversy leading to riot and
bloodshedi The colonies refused to ratify the plantheir weak
Noddles are perfectly distractedi wrote Franklin He was
probably right when he observed in  that had the plan been adopted
the subsequent Separation of the Colonies from the Mother Country might
not so soon have happenedi The sending of British regulars to
America and the resulting efforts at taxation were not least among the
sparks which set off the Revolution

Franklins Three Letters to Governor Shirley  while expressing
no credulous views of the wisdom of the people maintained in one breath
that the colonists were loyal to the Constitution and Crown as ever
colonists were and in another that it is supposed an undoubted right of
Englishmen not to be taxed but by their own consent given through their
representativesi Shirley had apparently written that the
Council in the Albany Plan should be appointed by England and not by
the colonial assemblies Franklin held for the colonists right to
English civil liberty and the right to enjoy the Constitution Here
again we find a factor later magnified into one of the major causes of
the Revolution

In addition to being lethargic in the defense of the Pennsylvania
borders the proprietor refused to be taxed except for a trifling Part
of his Estate the Quitrents located unimprovd Lands Money at
Interest etc etc being exempted by Instructions to the
Governori Thereupon Franklin turned from colonial affairs
which had indeed proved obstinate to pressing local matters when in
 he was appointed agent to go to London to demand that the
proprietor submit his estates to be taxed In the Report of the
Committee of Aggrievances of the Assembly of Pennsylvaniai Feb
  it was charged that the proprietor had violated the royal
charter and the colonists civil rights as Englishmen and had abrogated
their natural rights rights inherent in every man antecedent to all
lawsi Later it was but a short step from provincial matters to
colonial rights of revolution In this Report we see Franklin
associated for the first time expressly with the
throneandaltardefying concept of natural rights

Although we have yet to review the evidence which shows that Franklin at
one stage in his political career was an archimperialist we need to
digress to observe an intellectual factor which if only fragmentarily
expressed in his political thought during his activities in behalf of
Pennsylvania liberties was to become a momentous sanction when during
the war he became a diplomat of revolution From the Stoics from
Cicero Grotius Puffendorf Burlamaqui and as Rev Jonathan
Mayhewi observes from Plato and Demosthenes from Sidney Milton
Hoadley and Locke in addition from Gordon and Trenchard see Catos
Letters and The Independent Whig Blackstone Cokefrom these and
many others the colonists derived a pattern of thought known as natural
rights dependent on natural lawi There is no better summary of
natural rights than the Declaration of Independence and of it John
Adams remarked There is not an idea in it but what has been hackneyed
in Congress for two years beforei Carl Becker pointedly
observes Where Jefferson got his ideas is hardly so much a question as
where he could have got away from themi A characteristic summary
of natural law may be found in Blackstones Commentariesi

    This law of nature being coeval with mankind and dictated by
    God himself is of course superior in obligation to any
    other It is binding over all the globe in all countries and
    at all times no human laws are of any validity if contrary
    to this and such of them as are valid derive all their force
    and all their authority mediately or immediately from this
    originali

Discoverable only by reason natural laws are immutable and universal
apprehensible by all men As Hamilton wrote

    The origin of all civil government justly established must
    be a voluntary compact between the rulers and the ruled and
    must be liable to such limitations as are necessary for the
    security of the absolute rights of the latter for what
    original title can any man or set of men have to govern
    others except their own consent To usurp dominion over a
    people in their own despite or to grasp at a more extensive
    power than they are willing to intrust is to violate that
    law of nature which gives every man a right to his personal
    liberty and can therefore confer no obligation to
    obediencei

In a presocial state real or hypothetical men possess certain
natural rights the crown of them according to Lockei being the
mutual preservation of their lives liberties and estates which I call
by the general name property In entering the social state men through
free consent are willing to sacrifice fragments of their natural rights
in order to gain civil rights This process would seem tyrannical were
one to forget that the surrender is sanctioned by the principle of
consent Men in sacrificing their rights expect from society ie the
governors civil rights and in addition protection of their
unsurrendered natural rights A voluntary compact is achieved between
the governor and the governed If laws are fabricated which contravene
these the governed have retained for themselves the right of forcible
resistance A natural inference from these premises is that sovereignty
rests with the people In the colonies this secular social compact was
buttressed by the principle of covenants and natural rights within the
churches Sermons became textbooks of politicsi Miss Baldwin
has ably illustrated how before  the clergy in Franklins native New
England had popularized the doctrines of natural right the social
contract and the right of resistance as well as the fundamental
principle of American constitutional law that government like its
citizens is bounded by law and when it transcends its authority it acts
illegallyi

In an oration commemorating the Boston massacre Dr Benjamin Church
stated the principle of the compact A sense of their wants and
weakness in a state of nature doubtless inclined them to such
reciprocal aids and support as eventually established societyi
Defining liberty as the happiness of living under laws of our own
making by our personal consent or that of our representativesi
he warned that any breach of trust in the governor effectually absolves
subjects from every bond of covenant and peacei

Then too Newtonian science buttressed the principle of natural rights
Sir Isaac Newton demonstrated mathematically that the universe was
governed by a fagot of immutable universal and harmonious physical
laws These were capable of being apprehended through reason Now even
as reason discovered the matchless physical harmony so could reason
men argued ferret out unvarying universal principles of
socialpolitical rights These principles constituted natural rights
natural to the extent that all men had the power if not the capacity
to discover and learn them through use of their native reason Newton
demonstrated the validity of physical law Locke sanctioned the
supremacy of reason Since Franklin was himself motivated by Newtonian
rationalism and was a student of Locke there is reason to believe that
he was vibrantly aware of the extent to which the
scientificrationalistic ideology lent sanction to mans timeless quest
for the certitude of natural rights antecedent to all laws

Franklins mission to London in  as Pennsylvania agent may be
understood through an examination of An Historical Review of the
Constitution and Government of Pennsylvania London i If
not written by him at least the ideas are his Convinced that the
proprietors seem to have no regard to the Publick Welfare so the
private Point may be gainedTis like Firing a House to have
Opportunity of stealing a Trencheri Franklin knew that a
brilliant attack had to be made were he to intimidate the proprietary
government into assuming its charter responsibilities and granting the
colonists what they considered to be inviolable rights By  his
Patience with the Proprietors is almost tho not quite spenti A
few months later impatient with unresponsive officials he wrote to
Joseph Galloway God knows when we shall see it finishd and our
Constitution settled firmly on the Foundation of Equity and English
Liberty But I am not discouraged and only wish my Constituents may
have the Patience that I have and that I find will be absolutely
necessaryi In  Franklin still found the proprietors
obscure uncertain and evasive and was acutely virulent in despising
Rev William Smith who was in London attacking him and the Quaker
Assemblys demandsi In the same letter to Galloway he uttered a
thought which he sought to develop during his second trip to London as
Assembly agent in  For my part I must own I am tired of
Proprietary Government and heartily wish for that of the Crown

Turning to An Historical Review to learn the political principles
sanctioning the Assemblys grievances against its feudal lords one
finds that the colonists conceived it our duty to defend the rights and
privileges we enjoy under the royal charteri Secondly they
reminded the lords that the laws agreed upon in England prior to the
settling of Pennsylvania were of the nature of an original compact
between the proprietary and the freemen and as such were reciprocally
received and executedi Thirdly they demanded the right to
exercise the birthright of every British subject to have a property
of their own in their estate person and reputation subject only
to laws enacted by their own concurrence either in person or by
their representativesi Fourthly they resisted the proprietors
on basis of their possession of natural rights antecedent to all
lawsi The editor of the protest charged that It is the cause of
every man who deserves to be free everywherei It is ironic that
this grievance should have enjoyed the sanction of one who like Lord
Chatham was an empire builder one who proudly wrote I am a Briton
and even during the time he sought to retrieve the Pennsylvania
colonists lost natural rights entertained the ideas of a British
imperialist Franklin little saw that the internal Pennsylvania struggle
was to be contagious that the provincial revolt was motivated partially
at least by political theories which were to be given expression par
excellence when a discontented minority created the Declaration of
Independence In  Franklin had the satisfaction of witnessing the
victory of the Assembly over the Proprietors although he was not
unaware that the right to tax feudal lands was less than that right he
had already envisionedthe right to become a royal colonyi

But Franklins pleas for charter constitutional and natural rights may
be misleading if one considers his position as suggestive of doctrinaire
republicanism of Paines Government is the badge of our lost
innocence or of Shelleys

    Kings priests and statesmen blast the human flower

His political activities assert the rights of the governed against the
governor his writings often indirectly suggest the intemperance of the
governed and the need for something more lasting than mere outer
freedom Like Coleridge who wrote

    Man may not hope from outward forms to win
    The passion and the life whose fountains are within

whitelocked Father Abraham harangued

    The Taxes are indeed very heavy and if those laid on by the
    Government were the only Ones we had to pay we might more
    easily discharge them but we have many others and much more
    grievous to some of us We are taxed twice as much by our
    Idleness three times as much by our Pride and four
    times as much by our Folly and from these Taxes the
    Commissioners cannot ease or deliver us by allowing an
    Abatementi

With solid good sense Franklin acknowledged that happiness in this
life rather depends on internals than externalsi

His purpose for being in London accomplished Franklin wrote The
Interest of Great Britain Considered with Regard to Her Colonies and
the Acquisitions of Canada and Guadaloupe  Since there is
evidence that the pamphlet created much contemporary interesti
Franklin undoubtedly had some influence in causing the retention of
Canada a retention which made the American Revolution
inevitablei If the release from French terrorism caused the
colonists to become myopic toward advantages lent them as a British
colony it is appropriate in view of Franklins later advocacy of
independence and ironic in view of his then imperialistic principles
that he should have written The Interest of Great Britain Here
Franklin later to be a propagandist of revolution cast himself in the
role of architect of a vast empire For economic reasons and for
colonial safety he urged the retention ridiculing the charge that the
colonies were lying in wait to declare their independence from England
if the French were cast out from Canada

Back in Pennsylvania in  he declared the provincial government
running fast into anarchy and confusioni In his Cool Thoughts
on the Present Situation of Our Public Affairs  he set up a
sturdy antagonism between Proprietary Interest and Power and Popular
Liberty Unlike the lunatic fringe of liberals who see Popular
Liberty compatible only with a tendency toward anarchy Franklin urged
that the Pennsylvania government lacked Authority enough to keep the
common Peacei The constitutional nature of proprietary
government had lost dignity and hence suffers in the Opinion of the
People and with it the Respect necessary to keep up the Authority of
Government Almost Burkean in his apology for change he suggested that
the popular party demand rather and only a Change of Governor that is
instead of selfinterested Proprietaries a gracious King His
Narrative of the Late Massacres in Lancaster Countyi is a bloody
tribute to the lack of authority and police power of the current regime
The Petition to the King for a royal governor maintained that torn by
armed Mobs the government was weak unable to support its own
Authority and maintain the common internal Peace of the
Provincei

While petitioning for a crown colony he found himself in  faced
with a larger than provincial interestLord Grenvilles Stamp Act
forced him into the role of one seeking definition of colonial status
Such was his position in his examination  before the House of
Commons relative to the repeal of the Stamp Act Almost brusquely he
told his catechizers that even a moderated stamp act could not be
enforced unless compelled by force of armsi With a preface
asserting that colonials before  were proud to be called OldEngland
men he summarized The authority of parliament was allowed to be valid
in all laws except such as should lay internal taxes It was never
disputed in laying duties to regulate commercei Parliament in
the colonial view had no right to lay internal taxes because we are
not represented there Mr Merriam observes that in advancing this
legal and constitutional issue the colonists had in short an
antiquated theory as to the position and power of Parliament and a
premature theory of Parliamentary representationi

Franklin referred to the Pennsylvania colonial charter to prove that all
that was asked for was the privileges and liberties of Englishmen
When the examiners asked whether the colonists appealing to the Magna
Charta and constitutional rights of Englishmen could not with equal
force object to the parliaments right of external taxation Franklin
with cautious ambiguity declared They never have hithertoi
Franklins skill in upholding tenuous almost metaphysical
constitutional grievances grievances however which were not upheld by
constitutional legalists in England captivated Edmund Burkes
imagination Franklin appeared to him like a schoolmaster catechizing a
pack of unruly schoolboys Conservative in his omission of any appeal to
natural rights he was radical in his legalistic distinctions between
parliamentary rights to levy certain kinds of taxes His position in
 and for several years following was one of seeking legal
definitions of the colonial status Considering the popular excesses in
the colonies Franklins view was anything but illiberally radical
Trying to counteract the general Rage against America artfully workd
up by the Grenville Factioni fearful that the unthinking rabble
in the colonies might demonstrate too lustily against duties and the
redcoatsi Franklin saw as a result of the constitutional
dilemma the true extent of the fracture

    But after all I doubt People in Government here will never
    be satisfied without some Revenue from America nor America
    ever satisfyd with their imposing it so that Disputes will
    from this Circumstance besides others be perpetually
    arising till there is a consolidating union of the
    wholei

His chief demand was for a less ambiguous relation between the mother
and her offspring for a unified pacific commonwealth empire Until he
left for the colonies in  he tirelessly sought through
conversation conference and articlesi sent to the British press
in addition he reprinted everything from America that he thought
might help our Common Cause to reiterate patiently the colonies
Charter libertiesi their abhorrence of Parliamentimposed
internal taxes and the quartering of redcoated battalions Constantly
hoping for a favorable Ministry of a Lord Rockingham or a Shelburne
and bemoaning the physical infirmities of Pitt which rendered him
politically impotent Franklin felt almost romantically confident at
first of a change that must come All the while like Merlins gleam
visions of a worldencircling British empire haunted the Pennsylvania
tradesman A letter to Barbeu Dubourg discloses at once his belief in an
imperial federationi and in the sovereignty of the colonial
assemblies In fact the British empire is not a single state it
comprehends many and though the Parliament of Great Britain has
arrogated to itself the power of taxing the colonies it has no more
right to do so than it has to tax Hanover We have the same King but
not the same legislaturesi Marginalia by Franklins hand in an
anticolonial pamphlet written by Dean Tucker indicate how completely
he and here he represented colonial not private opinion had failed
to see the growth of parliamentary power These Writers against the
Colonies all bewilder themselves by supposing the Colonies within the
Realm which is not the case nor ever wasi

By  Franklin had discovered the futility of his imperialistic
illusions ministries fearing the siren colonies had blocked their
ears with wax The Pennsylvanian knew that Divine Providence first
infatuates the power it designs to ruini He who had wished for
an empire as harmoniously companied as the orbited harmony of celestial
bodies lamented while on his way to America in  that so glorious a
Fabric as the present British Empire was to be demolished by these
Blunderersi Broken was that fine and noble China Vase the
British Empirei In  he would have gained little cheer from
William Livingstons opinion uttered in  I take it that clamour
is at present our best policyi

His sense of defeat was aggravated by that ugly scene in the Cockpit in
 when Wedderburn bespattered the taciturn colonial agent with foul
invective It had been charged that Franklin the postmaster had
purloinedi letters of Governor Hutchinson and Lieutenant Governor
Oliver of Massachusetts and had sent them back to the colonies as proof
of the colonists contention that the royal governors were hostile to
their colonial subjects He whom as Lord Chatham said all Europe held
in high Estimation for his Knowledge and Wisdom and rankd with our
Boyles and Newtons was decked by Wedderburn with the choicest flowers
of Billingsgate In the presence of Lord Shelburne Lord North the
Archbishop of Canterbury Edmund Burke Jeremy Bentham and Priestley
Franklin motionless and silent bore the harangue of the solicitor
general for a full three hoursi Franklins eloquent mock humility
inspired Horace Walpole to write

    Sarcastic Sawney swoln with spite and prate
    On silent Franklin poured his venal hate
    The calm philosopher without reply
    Withdrew and gave his country liberty

As propagandist for legislative freedom Franklin appealing for
sanction to legalistic and constitutional liberty more than to natural
rights was no more radical than Edmund Burke If ever an extreme
democrat Franklin had yet by  to become one Temperamentally
hostile to drunken electors the madness of mobs he held a
patrician attitude toward authority Earlier in  he had written
from London All respect to law and government seems to be lost among
the common people who are moreover continually inflamed by seditious
scribblers to trample on authority and every thing that used to keep
them in orderi To Georgiana Shipley he sent Epitaph on
Squirrel Mungos death this Miltonic and unrepublican sentiment

                    Learn hence
          Ye who blindly seek more liberty
    Whether subjects sons squirrels or daughters
    That apparent restraint may be real protection
            Yielding peace and plenty
                With securityi

In  he indicted Parliament in a letter to Joseph Galloway Its
Censures are no more regarded than Popes Bulls It is despisd for its
Venality and abominated for its Injustice But he hastened to show
that he had no illusions that men are natively pure that only
governments are wicked With almost a Hamiltonian distrust of the public
ranks he wrote And yet it is not clear that the People deserve a
better Parliament since they are themselves full as corrupt and venal
witness the Sums they accept for their Votes at almost every
Electioni

Back in the colonies Franklin remained just long enough to help form a
constitution for Pennsylvaniai and to aid Jefferson in writing
the Declaration of Independencei After the royal governors had
dissolved the assemblies and the Continental Congress urged the colonies
to form their own constitutions Franklin assumed leadership in his
state and helped to compose a constitution less conservative than those
of most of the other coloniesi Created between July  and Sept
  essentially by one who had just worked on and signed the
Declaration of Independence it is not strange that the dominant
ideology of this constitutionthat of natural rights the compact
theory and consent of the governedshould be like that of the
Declaration The new constitution has been called the most democratic
constitution yet seen in Americai The unicameral legislature
the assembly of representatives the plan of judicial review of laws
every seven years and other features have been looked upon as
demonstrating the dangerous ultrademocratic tendencies of Franklin The
revolutionary Benjamin Rush who had helped Paine with Common Sense
was dismayed because in his view Pennsylvania has substituted mob
government for one of the happiest governments in the world A single
legislature is big with tyranny I had rather live under the government
of one man than of seventytwoi One wonders to what extent
Franklin was responsible for the unicameral legislature when we know
that it was the natural outcome of Penns ideas of government as
embodied in his various chartersi The plural executive the
right of freemen to form their militia and elect their own officers
the extension of male suffrage and other innovations in this
constitution were of a radical nature in as far as the populace were
given greater liberties and responsibilities than ever before in the
colonies It seems almost incredible that the patricianminded Franklin
with his Puritan heritage should have thus almost hurriedly cast
himself at the feet of the people Certain extenuating factors may be
mentioned in an attempt not to gloss over but to understand the violent
antithesis between Franklin the imperialist and Franklin the
revolutionist To what extent did his antipathy for proprietary
governors as well as the general colonial experience with governors
suggest a joint executive of a council and governori Since his
experience as a Whig propagandist had been to exalt colonial
legislatures to what extent did he see in the unicameral form a plan
which would give freest movement to the legislative activity Prior to
 there is little that would suggest that Franklin had any confidence
in men uncheckedi Yet it is difficult to show that in the
first flush of indignation against England and revolutionary enthusiasm
Franklin did not favor for a time distinctly radical tendencies

In  he left as he wrote to Jan Ingenhousz to procure those aids
from European powers for enabling us to defend our freedom and
independencei He who had been a Servant to many publicks thro
a long life went to Passy where from the Htel de Valentinois of M
Roy de Chaumont he was to direct financial efforts calculated with
Washingtons generalship and the assiduous loyalty of a minority group
to win the Revolution Welcomed as the apotheosis of les
Insurgensi he was virtually deified as Turgot expressed it
Eripuit caelo fulmen sceptrumque tyrannis The universality of his
vogue in France was primarily due to his deistic naturalism his wily
pleading and activities in behalf of colonial independence the
receptivity of the Gallic mind for any martencapped child of the New
World and to his scientific thought and experimentation which had
fortified Reason in purging the unknown of its terror helping thus to
make the philosophe at home in his reasonable world Three weeks after
Franklin arrived in France one Frenchman said that it is the mode
today for everybody to have an engraving of M Franklin over the
mantelpiecei France overnight became Franklinist when the savant
came to dwell at Passy Even before the victory of Yorktown he became
la mode It was to be his success to convert Frances unrecognized
alliance with the colonies to an open and undisguised alliance perhaps
even to war with Englandi But even for one who enjoyed as John
Adams wrote a reputation more universal than that of Leibnitz or
Newton Frederick or Voltairei it was to be a difficult task to
manipulate a Beaumarchais a Vergennes and others in spite of the
wellknown and inveterate economic and political grievances which the
French held for the English The virtues he stressed in the Morals of
Chess he was able to translate into a diplomatic mien uniting
perfect silence with a generous civility As a result his record as
minister to France is marked by complete success but for this it is by
no means certain that American independence would have been achieved
until many years lateri

Plagued by Frenchmen desiring places in the colonial army feted by the
philosophes sorely vexed by the need for settling countless maritime
affairs embracing and embraced by the venerable Voltaire corresponding
with Hartley concerning exchange of prisoners shaping alliances and
treaties conducting scientific experiments investigating Mesmer
intrigued by balloon ascensions made the darling of several salons
associating in the Lodge of the Nine Sisters with Bailly Bonneville
Warville Condorcet Danton Desmoulins DAuberteuil Ption
Sainttienne Sieys and others all men who helped to give shape or
shapelessness to the French Revolutioni Franklin found little
time to search for that philosophic repose which he had long coveted It
may be extravagant to say that Franklin was the Creator of
Constitutionalism in Europei but we know that in  he printed
the colonial constitutions for continental distributioni It has
been suggested that Franklin was an important formative factor in
Condorcets faith in universal suffrage a unicameral legislature and
the liberties guaranteed by constitutional lawi Then too
Franklin had signed the Declaration of Independencea document which
the French hailed as the restoration of humanitys title
deedsi The Duc de la Rochefoucauld eulogized the unicameral
legislature of Pennsylvania identifying this grand idea and its
maximum of simplicity as Franklins creationi Fauchet eulogized
him as one of the foremost builders of our sacred constitutioni
Along with Helvtius Mably Rousseau and Voltaire Franklin was
considered as one who laid the foundations for the French
revolutioni Franklins taciturnity his art of listening his
diplomatic reserve do not suggest a volatile iconoclast doing anything
consciously to bring about a republican France This did not prevent him
from becoming a symbol of liberty by his mere presence in the land
stimulating patriots to examine the foundations of the tyrannical
authority which they saw or imagined enslaving them Holding no brief
for natural equality Franklin suggested that quiet and regular
Subordination is so necessary to Successi Realist that he was
he became almost obsessed with the innate depravity of men until he was
doubtful whether the Species were really worth producing or
preservingi One would not be considered excessively republican
who inveighed against the collected passions prejudices and private
interests of collective legislative bodiesi He wrote to Caleb
Whitefoord It is unlucky  that the Wise and Good should be as
mortal as Common People and that they often die before others are found
fit to supply their Placesi The great proportion of mankind
weak and selfish need the Motives of Religion to restrain them from
Vicei No less extreme than J Q Adamss retort to Paines
Rights of Man that it is anarchic to trust government to the custody
of a lawless and desperate rabble was Franklins distrust of the
unthinking majorityi

Having helped to free the colonies Franklin fittingly became if not
one of the fathers of the Constitution then due to the serenity with
which he helped to moderate the plans of extremists on both sides at
least its godfather If as Mr James M Beck asserts the success of
the Constitution has been the result of its approximation of the golden
mean between monarchy and anarchy the section and the nation the
small and the large state then its success may be attributed not a
little to Franklins geniusi After small and large states had
waged a fruitless struggle over congressional representation Franklin
spoke

    The diversity of opinion turns on two points If a
    proportional representation takes place the small States
    contend that their liberties will be in danger If an
    equality of votes is to be put in its place the large States
    say their money will be in danger When a broad table is to
    be made and the edges of planks do not fit the artist takes
    a little from both and makes a good jointi

The former imperialist could not logically become a state rights
advocate Engrossed essentially in promoting and securing the common
Goodi he derided the advantage the greater state would have
asserting that he was originally of Opinion it would be better if every
Member of Congress or our national Council were to consider himself
rather as a Representative of the whole than as an Agent for the
Interests of a particular State When Mr Randolph considered

    To negative all laws passed by the several States
    contravening in the opinion of the national legislature the
    articles of union the following words were added to this
    clause on motion of Mr Franklin or any Treaties subsisting
    under the authority of the unioni

This is anything but the corollary of a defender of state rights
Franklin was convinced that the permanence of the national view alone
could prevent federal anarchy Addressing himself to the problem of
delegated authority Madison observed This prerogative of the General
Govt is the great pervading principle that must controul the
centrifugal tendency of the States which without it will continually
fly out of their proper orbits and destroy the order  harmony of the
political systemi One is tempted to see here Newtons principle
of gravity translated into terms of political nationalism one wonders
whether it is probable that like Madisons Franklins emphasis on the
harmony of the whole could have been partly conditioned by the
cohesiveness and harmony of universal physical laws incarnate in
Newtonian physics of which he was a master

Franklin was apprehensive perhaps too apprehensivethat the
Government of these States may in future times end in a
Monarchyi He suggested that moderate rather than kingly salaries
paid the chief executive would tend to allay this danger Between
Randolph who belabored a single executive as the foetus of monarchy
and Wilson who harbored it as the best safeguard against tyranny
stood Franklin who saw it as subversive of democratic sovereignty but
not necessarily fatal He declared himself emphatically against the
motion that the executive have a complete negativei Extolling
popular sovereignty he warned that In free Governments the rulers are
the servants and the people their superiors  sovereignsi He
refused to consider a plan which sought to establish a franchise only
for freeholders It is of great consequence that we shd not depress
the virtue  public spirit of our common people of which they displayed
a great deal during the war and which contributed principally to the
favorable issue of iti Pinckney had made a motion that rulers
should have unencumbered estates

    Doctr Franklin expressed his dislike of every thing that
    tended to debase the spirit of the common people If honesty
    was often the companion of wealth and if poverty was exposed
    to peculiar temptation it was not less true that the
    possession of property increased the desire of more
    propertyi This Constitution will be much read and
    attended to in Europe and if it should betray a great
    partiality to the richwill not only hurt us in the esteem
    of the most liberal and enlightened men there but discourage
    the common people from removing to this Countryi

Pinckneys motion was rejected Franklin within the Convention did not
seem to fear Gerrys threatthe evils we experience flow from the
excess of democracyi

Franklin suggested the adoption of a unicameral legislature but does
not seem to have made any struggle for it His article of  in
defense of the Pennsylvania unicameral legislature however shows
that he clung to the principle as firmly as he had in i He
questioned The Wisdom of a few Members in one single Legislative Body
may it not frequently stifle bad Motions in their Infancy and so
prevent their being adopted In addition the bicameral house is
cumbersome and provocative of delay

Little is known of Franklins attitude toward the violent controversy
attendant upon efforts toward ratification In his Ancient Jews and
AntiFederalistsi he warned the traducers of the new Constitution
against voiding an instrument which in his opinion was as sound as the
frailty of human reason would allow it to be In fact said he it
astonishes me  to find this system approaching so near to
perfection as it doesi He may be said to have been
antifederalistic to the extent that he feared a strong executive
guarded jealously the legislative sphere worried little about checks
and balances sought to accelerate popular sovereignty he was
federalistic to the extent that he opposed state localism with national
sovereignty was not blind to the depravity of human nature and hence
felt the need for a vigorous coercive government To M Le Veillard he
confessed an almost Hamiltonian distrust of the multitude The
Constitution has  met with great opposition in some States for we
are at present a nation of politicians And though there is a general
dread of giving too much power to our governors I think we are more
in danger from too little obedience in the governedi He made
the same complaint a year later We have been guarding against an evil
that old States are most liable to excess of power in the rulers
but our present danger seems to be defect of obedience in the
subjectsi It is difficult to reconcile his inveterate distrust
of men with his activity in behalf of an almost universal franchise
reluctance to sanction the principle of checks and balances and belief
in a unicameral legislature it is difficult to reconcile the Plutarchan
fervor with which he advocated the wisdom of following great leaders
with his fear of a vigorous executive It is not improbable that those
ideas which are generally antifederalistic in Franklins political view
are in part the result of his hatred of proprietary abuses which he
witnessed as a provincial statesman during his middle age



VII FRANKLIN AS SCIENTIST AND DEIST

Jan Ingenhousz the celebrated physician to Maria Theresa of Austria
wrote a letter to Franklin on May   which doubtless caused the
patriarch of Passy to reflectnot without sadness of hearton the
diversified fortune which time and circumstance had devised for him The
physician no friend to the American revolution implored Franklin not
to abandon entirely the world Nature whose laws made by the supreme
wisdom and is constant and unalterable as its legislature himself
sic Ingenhousz lamented that Franklin a Philosopher so often and
so successfully employed in researches of the most intricate and the
most mysterious operations of Naturei should have given his time
to politics

Franklin is now most commonly viewed as a utilitarian moralist a
successful tradesman and printer a shrewd propagandist and financier
the diplomat of the Revolution and if at all as a scientist then only
as a virtuoso fashioning devices such as open stoves bifocal
spectacles and lightning rods for practical uses Probably few
general readers are aware that Franklin was a disinterested scientist in
the sense that he interrogated nature with an eye to discovering its
immutable laws It is conversely supposed that Franklin himself was
unaware of any inclination to pursue natural science to the exclusion of
those political achievements which have identified him as one of the
wiliest and sagest diplomats of the Enlightenment

It may be learned however not without astonishment that Franklin
almost from the beginning of his participation in politics resented the
time given over to such activities as so much time lost to his
speculations and research in natural science As early as  he
wistfully though realistically confessed that business sometimes
obliges one to postpone philosophical amusementsi A month after
this he wrote to Cadwallader Colden I congratulate you on the
prospect you have of passing the remainder of life in philosophical
retirementi In the midst of investigating waterspouts he
observed to John Perkins How much soever my Inclinations lead me to
philosophical Inquiries I am so engagd in Business public and
private that those more pleasing pursuits of natural science are
frequently interruptedi He urged Dr John Fothergill to give
himself repose delight in viewing the Operations of nature in the
vegetable creationi In  upon completing his negotiations in
behalf of the Pennsylvania Assembly he promised Lord Kames that he
would engage in no other political affairsi To the notable
professor of physics of the University of Turin Giambatista Beccaria
he wrote in  from London where he had sought to have the Stamp Act
rescinded that he had to take away entirely his attention from
philosophical matters though I have constantly cherished the hope of
returning home where I could find leisure to resume the studies that I
have shamefully put off from time to timei Again in  he
confessed to Beccaria I find myself here Passy immersd in Affairs
which absorb my Attention and prevent my pursuing those Studies in
which I always found the highest Satisfaction and I am now grown so
old as hardly to hope for a Return of that Leisure and Tranquillity so
necessary for Philosophical Disquisitionsi He longed in 
to have Congress release him so that he might spend the Evening of Life
more agreeably in philosophic devoted to natural science
Leisurei He who John Winthrop claimed was good at starting
Game for Philosophersi acknowledged that he had thrown himself
on the public which having as it were eaten my flesh seemed now
resolved to pick my bonesi Reverend Manasseh Cutler visited
Franklin a few months before the patriarchs death They ardently
discussed botany Franklin boyish in his eagerness to show the Reverend
Mr Cutler a massive book containing the whole of Linnaeus Systema
Vegetabilies The Doctor seemed extremely fond through the course of
the visit of dwelling on Philosophical subjects and particularly that
of natural History while the other Gentlemen were swallowed up with
politicsi In a fictitious  conversation between Joseph II of
Austria and Franklin the Newton of electricity is reported as
explaining that he was early in life attracted by natural philosophy
Necessity afterwards made me a politician I was Franklin the
Philosopher to the world long after I had in fact become Franklin
the Politiciani After reviewing the evidence it seems
incredulous to doubt that regardless of his achievements in other
fields Franklin sought his greatest intellectual pleasure in scientific
research and speculation and that his doctrines of scientific deism
antedated and conditioned his political economic and humanitarian
interests

If Franklins inventions have been justly praised his affections for
the empirical scientific method and his philosophic interest in Natures
laws have been unjustly ignored He observed to Ebenezer Kinnersley
that a philosopher cannot be too much on his guard in crediting their
careless observers relations of things extraordinary and should
never build an hypothesis on any thing but clear facts and experiments
or it will be in danger of soon falling  like a house of
cardsi and to Abb Soulavie You see I have given a loose to
imagination but I approve much more your method of philosophizing
which proceeds upon actual observation makes a collection of facts and
concludes no farther than those facts will warranti In  he
wrote to Sir Joseph Banks president of the Royal Society that he
longed to sit down in sweet Society with my English philosophic
Friends communicating to each other new Discoveries and proposing
Improvements of old ones all tending to extend the Power of Man over
Matter avert or diminish the Evils he is subject to or augment the
Number of his Enjoymentsi A careful study of his scientific
papers discloses that he was not untrained in the method of hypotheses
sustained or rejected by patient and laborious experimentation not
fortuitously did he arrive at conclusions in electricity which were
epochal in  His rejection of the twofluid theory of electricity
and substitution of the onefluid theory  his coinage of the
appropriate terms positive and negative to denote an excess or a
deficit of the common electric fluid  his explanation of the Leyden
jar and notably his recognition of the paramount rle played by the
glass or dielectric  his experimental demonstration of the identity
of lightning and electricity and  his invention of the lightning
conductor for the protection of life and property together with his
clear statement of its preventive and protective functionsi Not
only an inventor Franklin inductively observed natural phenomena and
drew conclusions until he had created a virtual Principia of
electricity His contemporaries were not loath to honor him as a second
Newton Franklin however was in all of his researches under a
selfconfessed yoke which doubtless tended to deny him access to the
profoundest reaches of scientific inquiry from Philadelphia he wrote in
 to Cadwallader Colden eminent mathematician as well as versatile
scientist Your skill  Expertness in Mathematical Computations will
afford you an Advantage in these Disquisitions among them researches
in electricity that I lament the want of who am like a Man searching
for some thing in a dark Room where I can only grope and guess while
you proceed with a Candle in your Handi

In an effort to learn the modus operandi of Franklins philosophic
thought let us now review its genetic development its probable
sources its relation to scientific deism and the degree to which he
achieved that serene repose for which he ever strove A pioneer American
rationalist not without his claims to being another Voltaire
Franklin as a youth read those works which were forming or interpreting
the thought patterns of the age Born in an epoch presided over by a
Locke and a Newton an epoch of rationalism and supernatural
rationalism alike fed by physicomathematical speculation Franklin
barely beyond adolescence felt the impacts of the age of reason
Scholars before and since M M Curtis have explained that in religion
he was a Deist of the type of Lord Herbert of Cherburyi M Fa
has sought without convincing documentary evidence to interpret
Franklins philosophic mind in terms of Pythagoreanismi We may
find that these views are over simple and historically inadequateeven
wrong

Franklin was reared piously in the Dissenting wayi by a pious
and prudent Calvinistic father who died as he lived with entire
Dependence on his Redeemeri Religiously educated as a
Presbyteriani young Benjamin was taught that Major est
Scripturae auctoritas quam omnis humani ingen capacitas He was
nurtured on the Bible and books in polemic divinity and he regularly
attended services at the Old South Church Doubtless without reflection
he was led to identify goodness with the church and its worship He was
a part of New Englands bibliolatry Not long before he was apprenticed
to his brother James he read Cotton Mathers BonifaciusAn Essay upon
the Good that is to be Devised and Designed by those who desire to
Answer the Great End of Life and to do good while they live and
Defoes Essays upon Several Projects or Effectual Ways for Advancing
the Interests of the Nation He confessed in  that Bonifacius
gave me such a turn of thinking as to have an influence on my conduct
through life for I have always set a greater value on the character of
a doer of good than on any other kind of reputationi Mather
as an exponent of Christian charity urged that man help his neighbors
with a rapturous assiduityi that he may discover the ravishing
satisfaction which he might find in relieving the distresses of a poor
miserable neighbori It is ironic that Mather should have
apparently aided a young man to divorce himself from the strenuous
subtleties of theology Franklin was too young to gather that Mather
circumspectly warned against a covenant of works and hence was Pauline
in his advocacy of charity rather than of humanitarianism And from
Defoes Essays Franklin received more than a penchant for projects
Like Mather Defoe observed that God Almighty has commanded us to
relieve and help one another in distressi Defoe seemed to young
Franklin to dwell on fellowserviceto promise that the good man need
not have understood all of the dogma of Old South meetinghouse

Apprenticed to James Franklin admitted that he now had access to
better booksi Whatever the extent of Jamess library in  by
 the New England Courant collection included Burnets History of
the Reformation Theory of the Earth the Spectator papers The
Guardian Art of Thinking Du Port Royal The Tale of a Tub and
the writings of Tillotsoni After reading most probably in these
and as we are told in Tryons Way to Health Xenophons
Memorabilia digests of some of Boyles lectures Anthony Collins
Locke and Shaftesbury Franklin became in his Calvinist religion a
real doubteri He became at the age of sixteen as a result of
reading Boyles Lecturesi a thorough Deisti We cannot be
certain of the Lectures read by Franklin but we may observe Bentleys
Folly of Atheism  and Derhams PhysicoTheology 
which are representative of the series provided for by Boyle Like
Mathers The Christian Philosopher i they both employ
science and rationalism to reinforce never as equivalent to or
substitute for scriptural theology Fed by Newtonian physics Bentley
discovers in gravity the great basis of all mechanism the immediate
fiat and finger of God and the executions of the divine lawi
Gravity the powerful cement which holds together this magnificent
structure of the worldi is the result of the Deity who always
acts geometrically Borrowing from Cockburne Ray Bentley and
Fnelon Derham offers likewise to prove the existence and operations of
the Workman from his Worki

It is unlikely that Boyles Lectures characterized by orthodox
rationalism augmented by Newtonianism would alone have precipitated in
Franklin a thorough deism Not improbably Locke Shaftesbury and
Anthony Collins whom Franklin mentions reading were most militant in
overthrowing his inherited bibliolatry Although he does not say exactly
which of Collinss works he read Collinss rationale is repeated
clearly enough in any one of his pieces Warring against crackbraind
Enthusiasts the prodigious Ignorance and Impositions of Priests
against defective scriptural texts Collins defends our natural
Notions against the authoritarianism of priests Vilifying the
authority of the surplice he apotheosizes the authority of
reasoni He intensifies the English tradition of
everymanhisownpriest and exclaims How uncertain Tradition
isi From this militant friend of John Locke Franklin was
doubtless impregnated with an odium theologicum and an exalted idea of
the sanctity of Reason

Having read An Essay Concerning Human Understandingi Franklin
may have remembered that Locke there observed Nothing that is contrary
to and inconsistent with the clear and selfevident dictates of
reason has a right to be urged or assented to as a matter of faith
wherein reason hath nothing to doi Like Collins Locke urged a
deistic rationale

    Since then the precepts of Natural Religion are plain and
    very intelligible to all mankind and seldom to come to be
    controverted and other revealed truths which are conveyed
    to us by books and languages are liable to the common and
    natural obscurities and difficulties incident to words
    methinks it would become us to be more careful and diligent
    in observing the former and less magisterial positive and
    imperious in imposing our own sense and interpretations of
    the latteri

In addition Franklin may have been influenced by Lockes implied
Newtonianism he would suspect the subtleties of the Old South Church
when he read For the visible marks of extraordinary wisdom and power
appear so plainly in all the works of the creation that a rational
creature who will but seriously reflect on them cannot miss the
discovery of a Deityi Like Newton Locke inferred an infinite
and benevolent Geometrician from the magnificent harmony of the
universe

Franklin also read Shaftesburys Characteristics which Warburton
quotes Pope as saying had done more harm to revealed religion in
England than all the works of infidelity put togetheri Although
he may have pondered over Shaftesburys virtuoso theory of
Benevolence he was not one to be readily convinced of the innate
altruism of man His Puritan heritage linked with an empirical realism
prevented him from becoming prey to Shaftesburys a priori optimism He
was aware of the potential danger of a complacent trust in natural
impulses which often lead to

    The love of sweet security in sin

To what extent did Franklins nascent humanitarianismmildly provoked
by the neighborliness of Mather and Defoereceive additional sanction
from Shaftesburys doctrine that compassion is the supreme form of
moral beauty the neglect of it the greatest of all offenses against
natures ordained harmonyi Identifying selflove and social
Shaftesbury saw the divine temper achieved through affection for the
public the universal goodi Born among men who were convinced
of the supremacy of scripture Franklin would at first be astonished
then perhaps liberated upon reading in the Characteristics that
Religion excludes only perfect atheismi From such a piece as
Shaftesburys An Inquiry Concerning Virtue or Merit Franklin learned
that not all men preserved a union between theology and ethics
scripture and religion Although Shaftesbury occasionally indicated a
reverence for sacred scriptures the totality of his thought was cast in
behalf of natural religion He was convinced that the Deity is
sufficiently revealed through natural Phenomenai Extolling the
apprehension of the Deity through mans uniform reason Shaftesbury
urbanely lampooned enthusiasm that private revelation which threatened
to prevail against the consensus gentium

By  Franklin had divorced theology from morality and morality from
conscience having punctuated his youth with faunish erratai
Although he was as a youth too much at ease in Zion he did not lose
substantial if then a theoretic faith in the struggle between the law
of the spirit and the law of the members Nurtured by the Bible Bunyan
Addison and Steele Tryon Socrates and Xenophona blend of Christian
and classical traditionshe felt the reasonableness if not the
saintliness of curbing the resolute sway of his natural selfi

After five years with James a year in Philadelphia where part of the
time he worked with Samuel Keimeri a fanatic and bearded
Camisard Franklin through the duplicity of Governor Keith found
himself in November  aboard the LondonHope Englandbound It
would be unfair to Franklin were we to think him a primitive colonist to
whom England was an unreal incalculable land We remember that James
knew the London of Anne Addison Steele Locke and Newton And we have
seen that the New England Courant library was one of which no London
gentleman and scholar need have been ashamed As a worker on this
newspaper Franklin had set up the names and some indications of the
thoughts of such men as Fnelon Tillotson Defoe Swift Butler Bayle
Isaac Watts Blount Burnet Whiston Temple Trenchard and Gordon
Denham Garth Dryden Milton Locke Flamstead and Newtoni

During his two years in London working successively in the printing
houses of Samuel Palmer and James Watts he mingled with many of the
leaders of the day Probably because he had while yet in America read
in the transactions of the Royal Society of the virtuosis interest in
asbestos he wrote to Sir Hans Sloane offering to show him purses made
of that novel stuffi And we know that Sir Hans Sloane received
Franklin in his home at Bloomsbury Square Before he met other notables
he published what he called later an erratum A Dissertation on
Liberty and Necessity Pleasure and Pain i Franklin
himself said this work was the result of his setting up Wollastons The
Religion of Nature Delineatedi at Palmers and his not agreeing
with the authors reasonings Coming to Wollastons work with
Franklins Dissertation and Articles of Belief in mind we can
however see much that Franklin agreed with general principles which do
little more than reflect the current patterns of thought Like Franklin
Wollaston saw Reason as the great law of our naturei With Locke
he denied innate ideasi That part of The Religion of Nature
Delineated in which he searched with laborious syllogistic reasoning
for the Ultimate Cause which could not produce itself may have been
boring to the less agile mind of the young printer Wollaston however
apologized for his syllogistic gymnastics offered in proof of Deity
since much more may those greater motions we see in the world and the
phenomena attending them afford arguments for such a proof

    I mean the motions of the planets and the heavenly bodies
    For these must be put into motion either by one Common
    mighty Mover acting upon them immediately or by causes and
    laws of His Appointment or by their respective movers who
    for reasons to which you can by this time be no stranger
    must depend upon some Superior that furnished them with
    the power of doing thisi

With Newtonian rapture he marveled at the grandness of this fabric of
the worldi at the chorus of planets moving periodically by
uniform laws Rapt in wonder he gazed up to the fixt stars that
radiant numberless host of heaven Like a Blackmore Ray Fontenelle
or Newton he felt that they were probably all possest by proper
inhabitantsi He wondered at the just and geometrical
arrangement of thingsi These are all sentiments that Franklin
expressed in his philosophical juveniliai But then Franklin
after reading this sublimated geometry which reduced the parts of
creation to an equally sublime simplicity noted in Wollaston that man
must be a free agenti that good and evil are as black and white
distinguishablei that empirically the will is free the author
urging with Johnsonian good sense The short way of knowing this
certainly is to tryi Franklins Dissertation was dedicated to
his friend James Ralph and prefaced by a misquotation from Dryden and
Lees Oedipus It purports as Franklin wrote in  to prove the
doctrine of fate from the supposed attributes of God  that in
erecting and governing the world as he was infinitely wise he knew
what would be best infinitely good he must be disposed and infinitely
powerful he must be able to execute it consequently all is
righti With confidence lent him by his a priori method he
proposed I There is said to be a First Mover who is called God
Maker of the Universe II He is said to be allwise allgood
allpowerfuli With the nonchalance of an abstractionist he
concluded Evil doth not existi Transcending the sensational
necessitarianismi of Anthony Collins and John Locke Franklin
observed with an eye on Newtons law of gravitation that man has
liberty the Liberty of the same Nature with the Fall of a heavy Body
to the Ground it has Liberty to fall that is it meets with nothing to
hinder its Fall but at the same Time it is necessitated to fall and
has no Power or Liberty to remain suspendedi As a disciple of
Lockes psychology Franklin reflected his concept of the tabula rasa
in describing an infants mind which is as if it were not All our
Ideas are first admitted by the Senses and imprinted on the Brain
increasing in Number by Observation and Experience there they become
the Subjects of the Souls Action

In the Dissertation one can discover the extent to which Franklin had
absorbed if not from Newtons own works then from his popularizers and
intellectual sons such as Pemberton Franklins friend several of the
essential tenets of Newtonianism Here we see his belief in a universe
motivated by immutable natural laws comprising a sublimely harmonious
system reflecting a Wise Geometrician a world in which man desires to
affect a corresponding inner heaven Enraptured by the order of the
natural laws of Newtonianism and like a Shaftesbury searching for a
demonstrable inner harmony Franklin carrying his a priorism to logical
absurdity was unable to reconcile free will with Omniscience
Omnipotence and Goodness In how far was this partly the result of his
having been steeped in Calvinisms doctrine of Election

The Dissertation is as appreciative of Newtons contribution to
physics and thought as Thomsonsi To the Memory of Sir Isaac
Newton Not unlike Franklins framework is Shaftesburys thought in
An Inquiry Concerning Virtue or Meriti Since Franklin
acknowledged his reading of Shaftesbury and since as late as  he
borrowed heavily from the Characteristics it seems probable that
Shaftesbury lent Franklin in this case some sanction for his only
metaphysical venturei

As one result of his printing A Dissertation he made the acquaintance
of Lyons author of The Infallibility of Human Judgementi who
introduced him to Mandevillei and Dr Henry Pemberton who in
turn Promisd to give me an opportunity some time or other of seeing
Sir Isaac Newton of which I was extreamly desirous but this never
happened the italics are the editorsi Dr Pemberton
physician and mathematician met Newton in  and during the time
Franklin enjoyed his friendship was helping Newton to prepare the third
edition of the Principia As a result of his aiding Newton to
discover and understand his writingsi Pemberton in 
published A View of Sir Isaac Newtons Philosophy It is obvious that
Franklin could have discovered few men with a more concentrated and
enthusiastic knowledge of Newtonianism than that possessed by Dr
Pemberton As we have already noted Franklin undoubtedly derived his
appreciation of Newtonian speculation not from grubbing in the
Principia but from secondary sources There is no reason to apologize
for Franklin on this score when we remember that Voltaire who
popularized Newtonianism in France exclaimed Very few people read
Newton because it is necessary to be learned to understand him But
everybody talks about him Desaguliers coming to London from Oxford in
 observed that he found all Newtonian philosophy generally
receivd among persons of all ranks and professions and even among the
ladies by the help of experimentsi Pemberton wrote that the
desire after knowledge of Newtonianism is by nothing more fully
illustrated than by the inclination of men to gain an acquaintance with
the operations of nature which disposition to enquire after the causes
of things is so general that all men of letters I believe find
themselves influenced by iti Through the sublimated mathematics
of the Principia Pemberton observed the similitude found in all
parts of the universe makes it undoubted that the whole is governed by
one supreme being to whom the original is owing of the frame of nature
which evidently is the effect of choice and designi To what
extent Franklin later gave evidence of his knowledge of Newtonian
speculation we shall further discover in his Articles of Belief

He returned in the summer of  on the Berkshire to Philadelphia
with Mr Denham a sweetly reasonable Quakeri During this
journey he wrote his Journal of a Voyage from London to Philadelphia
indicating a virtuosos interest in all novel phenomena of nature In
Philadelphia he worked for Denham then Keimer and finally established
his own printing house in  a year after founding the Juntoi
and the year of his Articles of Belief By this time Franklin like
Hume wearied of metaphysics Commonly this creed has been described as
illustrating the deism of Lord Herbert of Cherbury It is true that
Franklin admits a God who ought to be worshipped the chief parts of
worship being the cultivation of virtue and piety but there is no
suggestion of Lord Herberts fourth and fifth dogmas that sin must be
atoned for by repentance and that punishment and rewards follow this
life His reaction against Calvinism may be shown in his failure to
include reference to scripture the experience of faith and the triune
godhead presided over by the redeemer Christ As a deist he accepted
one supreme most perfect Being This Deity is the Author and Father
of the Gods themselves Infinite and incomprehensible He has created
many gods each having made for himself one glorious Sun attended with
a beautiful and admirable System of Planets Franklin offered his
adoration to that Wise and Good God who is the author and owner of our
System It is conventional to suggest that his interest in the
plurality of worlds and gods should be traced to Platos
Timaeusi In the absence of any conclusive evidence concerning
Franklins study of Plato and in view of his profound awareness of
contemporary scientific and philosophical thought it seems more
reasonable to see the source of this idea in the thought of his own age
Let us remember that with the growth of the heliocentric cosmology there
resulted a vast expanse of the unknown bound to intrigue the
speculations of the philosophers of the age We know that Ray Fnelon
Blackmore Huygens Fontenelle Shaftesbury Locke and Newton all
wondered about the plurality of worlds and gods

In company with the supernatural rationalists and deists Franklin
exalted Reason as the experience through which God is discovered and
known Through Reason he is capable of observing his Wisdom in the
Creation With Newtonian zeal upon observing the glorious Sun with
his attending Worlds he saw the Deity responsible first for imparting
their prodigious motion and second for maintaining the wondrous Laws
by which they move As we have seen above this argument from the
design of creation to a Creator was one of the most influential and
popular of the impacts of Newtonian physics Like Fnelon Blackmore
and Ray whom he read and recommended that others readi Franklin
exclaimed

    Thy Wisdom thy Power and thy Goodness are everywhere
    clearly seen in the air and in the water in the Heaven and
    on the Earth Thou providest for the various winged Fowl and
    the innumerable Inhabitants of the Water thou givest Cold
    and Heat Rain and Sunshine in their Season et cetera

In addition to the works mentioned above which aided Franklin in
arriving at a natural religion it is certain that his views and even
idiom received stout reinforcement from such a passage as follows from
Rays classic work

    There is no greater at least no more palpable and convincing
    argument of the existence of a Deity than the admirable act
    and wisdom that discovers itself in the make and
    constitution the order and disposition the ends and uses of
    all the parts and members of this stately fabric of heaven
    and earth for if in the works of art  a curious edifice
    or machine counsel design and direction to an end
    appearing in the whole frame and in all the several pieces
    of it do necessarily infer the being and operation of some
    intelligent architect or engineer why shall not also in the
    works of nature that grandeur and magnificence that
    excellent contrivance for beauty order use c which is
    observable in them wherein they do as much transcend the
    effects of human art as infinite power and wisdom exceeds
    finite infer the existence and efficacy of an omnipotent and
    allwise Creatori

Then he directly referred to the Archbishop of Cambrays Trait de
lexistence et des attributs de Dieu Oliver Elton observes that this
work with its appeal to popular science is the chief counterpart in
France to the physicotheology current at the time in Englandi
From the skeleton of the smallest animal the bones the tendons the
veins the arteries the nerves the muscles which compose the body of
a single mani to this vaulted sky which turns around so
regularlyi all show the infinite skill of its Authori
Although Fnelon is applying Cartesian physics here Descartes
reinforced Newtonianism like Newton Fnelon argued that cosmic motion
is ordered by immutable laws so constant and so salutary
Blackmores Creation a Philosophical Poem  aiming to
demonstrate the existence of a God from the marks of wisdom design
contrivance and the choice of ends and means which appear in the
universei also furnished additional sanction for Franklins
emphasis on the wondrous laws of the creation and the discovery of the
Deity in his Work Like James Thomson Blackmore seeks to show how

    The long coherent chain of things we find
    Leads to a Cause Supreme a wise Creating Mindi

In revolt against the contractile elements in Calvinism Franklin
believed that God is not offended when he sees his Children solace
themselves in any manner of pleasant exercises and Innocent
Delightsi In his Articles of Belief Franklin retains from his
Dissertation his a priori concept of the Deity as a creator and
sustainer of Wondrous Laws immutable and beneficent To the
depersonalized First Mover however he has added some of those
Passions he has planted in us and he suggests furthermore that the
Deity is mildly providential A maker of systematic if inhuman
metaphysics in the Dissertation the author of the Articles in
spite of the superficial and embryonic metaphysics succeeds better in
making himself at home in his world To this embryonic religion linked
with Franklins obsession with the plurality of worlds and godsof no
real significance save to indicate picturesquely the extent to which he
had with the scientists of his age extended the limits of the physical
universe Franklin welded a pattern of ethics prudential but stern

Mr Hefelbowers description of the growth of free thought might
appropriately be applied to Franklins Articles As the supernatural
waned in radical Deism the ethical grew in importance until religion
was but a moral system on a theistic backgroundi Although the
metaphysical portions of this work are far too neighborly and casual to
be inspiring and provocative of saintliness the ethical conclusions
would that they were uttered less consciously and complacently are
worthy of the introspective force of New Englands stern mind of the
classic tradition of Socrates and Aristotle and of Englands unbending
emphasis on the middle wayi One could learn from the Articles
how to be just if he did not discover what is meant by the beauty of
holiness In  Franklin though bewildered by the tenuousness of
metaphysics based his religion on the everlasting tables of right
reason plumbing the mighty volumes of visible nature He was thus
our pioneer scientific deist who discovered his chief sanction in
popularized Newtonian physics

Following Franklins formal profession of deism buttressed by Newtonian
science in  one must depend on scattered references to plot the
persistence of his philosophic ideology His Dialogues between
Philocles and Horatio  borrowedi from Shaftesburys The
Moralists suggest that his moral speculations were dual and not
reconciled he seems torn between humanitarian compassion and the
selfdevelopment of the individual unable to decide which is the nobler
good One may observe that this moral bifurcation was inveterate in
Franklins mind never resolving itself into a fondness for the idea
that human nature is inexorably the product of institutions and outward
social forms A Witch Trial at Mount Holly suggests that he felt free
to handle scriptures with Aristophanic levity His intellectual
conviction of a matchless physical harmony as yet unmatched in the
world by a corresponding moral harmony is joyously seen in Preface to
Poor Richard 

    Whatever may be the Musick of the Spheres how great soever
    the Harmony of the Stars tis certain there is no Harmony
    among the Stargazers but they are perpetually growling and
    snarling at one another like strange Cursi

Even Polly Baker is made to appeal to nature and natures Godi
discovering in her bastard children the Deitys divine skill and
admirable workmanship in the formation of their bodies In Proposals
Relating to the Education of Youth in Pensilvania  Franklin
remarked in a note on Natural Philosophy that Proper Books may be
Rays Wisdom of God in the Creation Derhams PhysicoTheology
Pluches Spectacle de la Nature ci Poor Richard in
addition to prognostications of weather survey of roads Rabelaisian
wit and aphoristic wisdom was a popular vehicle for the diffusion of
a Newtonianism bordering on a mild form of deismi

Since Franklins interest in science is too commonly discussed as if his
research were synonymous with a tinkering and utilitarian inventiveness
it is pertinent to inquire in how far it was at least partially or even
integrally the result of his philosophic acceptance of Newtonianism
Since his philosophic rationale preceded his activities in science it
will not do to suggest that his interest in science was responsible for
his scientific deism He wrote August   to Cadwallader Colden
who was receptive to Newtonianism that he Franklin ought to study
the sciences in which hitherto he had merely dabbledi Then
follow his electrical experiments In one of his famous letters on the
properties and effects of electricity sent to Peter Collinson July 
 he allowed that the principle of repulsion affords another
occasion of adoring that wisdom which has made all things by weight and
measurei Investigatinglike a Newtonnatures laws Franklin
at first hand added to his philosophic assurance of the existence of a
Deity observable in the physical order

In  Franklin met Reverend George Whitefield whose sermons and
journals he printed while the evangelist remained in the
coloniesi He first angled public opinion through the
Pennsylvania Gazette promising to print Whitefields pieces if I
find sufficient Encouragementi The Pennsylvania Gazette
piously hoped that Whitefields heavenly discourses would be ever
remembered May the Impression on all our Souls remain to the Honour
of God both in Ministers and Peoplei As editor perhaps even
writer of some of those notices Franklin must have squirmed in praising
the activities of one who daily cast all deists in hell But it should
be observed that if Franklin could not accept Methodistic zeal he loved
Whitefield the mani Even so did Whitefield regard Franklin the
man and printerthough not the scientific deist Waiting to embark for
England in  Whitefield wrote to Franklin from Reedy Island Dear
Sir adieu I do not despair of your seeing the reasonableness of
Christianity Apply to God be willing to do the Divine Will and you
shall know iti Twelve years later Whitefield wrote to his
printerdeist friend I find that you grow more and more famous in the
learned world As you have made a pretty considerable progress in the
mysteries of electricity I would now humbly recommend to your diligent
unprejudiced pursuit and study the mysteries of the new birthi
When troops had been sent to Boston Franklin wrote a letter to
Whitefield after January   which offers a significant clue for
estimating Franklins philosophy I see with you that our affairs are
not well managed by our rulers here below I wish I could believe with
you that they are well attended to by those above I rather suspect
from certain circumstances that though the general government of the
universe is well administered our particular little affairs are perhaps
below notice and left to take the chance of human prudence or
imprudence as either may happen to be uppermost It is however an
uncomfortable thought and I leave iti Whitefield endorsed his
friends letter with the words Uncomfortable indeed and blessed be
God unscripturali If in  Franklin wrote to an unknown
correspondent perhaps Tom Painei that any arguments against
the Doctrines of a particular Providence strike at the Foundation of
all Religioni he also had written not long before that the
Dispensations of Providence in this World puzzle my weak Reasoni
Beneath the taciturn and allegedly complacent imperturbable Franklin
there is apparent a haunting inquietude Never dead to his Calvinist
heritage he sought to establish a providential relationship between the
Deity and mans fortunes not a little chilled in the presence of the
virtually depersonalized Deity of the Enlightenment If Calvins God was
wrathful he was providential his own Deity if benevolent and
omnipotent seemed strangely remote from the ken of mans moral
experience Science had shown him a Deity existing at the head of a
fagot of immutable laws If this Creator was picturesquely unlike the
fickle gods of Olympus he was strangely like them to the extent that he
seemed to exist apart from mans moral nature When he wrote to his
friend the Bishop of St Asaph It seems my Fate constantly to wish
for Repose and never to obtain iti was he in part longing for
the retirement when he would be able to resolve his doubts as to the
workings of Providence

M Marbois discussing Franklins religion with John Adams quietly
noted that Mr Franklin adores only great Naturei Joseph
Priestley lamented that a man of Dr Franklins general good character
and great influence should have been an unbeliever in Christianity and
also have done so much as he did to make others unbelieversi
This evidence appears untrustworthy in light of his diffident attitude
toward church attendance even toward scriptures as it may be
discovered in his collected worksi Even if he did not feel the
desire to attend formal services he seemed like Voltaire to feel that
they were salutary if only to furnish the canaille with the will to
obey authority In  Franklins mother Abiah Franklin wrote to her
son I hope you will lookup to God and thank Him for all His good
providences towards youi If he were unable to understand Gods
providences it was certain that he did not seek to disturb others by
calling the concept of a providential deity into question

In England and France Franklin was revered as the answer to the
Enlightenments prayer for the ideal philosopherscientist Sir John
Pringlei one of his warmest friends in a Royal Society lecture
in honor of Maskelyne might well have been describing Franklins place
in eighteenthcentury science when he said As much then remains to be
explored in the celestial regions you Maskelyne are encouraged Sir
by what has been already attained to persevere in these hallowed
labours from which have been derived the greatest improvements in the
most useful arts and the loudest declarations of the power the wisdom
and the goodness of the Supreme Architect in the Spacious and beautiful
fabric of the worldi To his age Franklin was that judicious
philosopher judicious and enlightened to the extent that his
experiments showed how men may perceive not only the direction of
Divine Wisdom but the goodness of Providence towards mankind in
having so admirably settled all things in the sublime arrangement of the
world that it should be in the power of men to secure themselves and
their habitations against the dire effects of lightningi
Turgots famous epigram on Franklin the republicandeist that he
snatched sceptres from kings and lightning from the heavens in part
expressed the extent to which the French public conceived of Franklin
the scientist as detracting from the terror in the cosmos hence making
their reasonable world more habitablei In the popular mind
deathdealing lightning had been the visible symbol and proof of
Calvins wrathful and capricious Jehovah Franklins dramatic and widely
popularized proof that even lightnings secrets were not past finding
out that it acted according to immutable laws and could be made mans
captive and menial slave no doubt had a powerful influence in
encouraging the great untheological public to become ultimately more
receptive to deism If Franklin was apotheosized as the apostle of
liberty he was no less sanctified as a Modern Prometheus In his own
words he saw science as freeing man from vain Terrorsi To
Condorcet his friend and disciple Franklin was one who was enabled to
wield a power sufficient to disarm the wrath of Heaveni

He expressed his creed just before his death in the oftenquoted letter
to Ezra Stilesi Bearing in mind his inveterate scientific deism
we are not surprised that his religion is one created apart from
Christian scripture that Jesus is the conventional amiable
philosopher respected but not worshipped by the Enlightenment If he
seems convinced in this letter that God governs the universe by his
Providence we have seen above that his attitude toward the Deitys
relation to man and his world was anything but sure and free from
disturbing reflection Convinced that the Deity ought to be
worshipped he next observed that the most acceptable service we
render to him is doing good to his other children His a priori concept
of a benevolent Deity whose goodness is expressed in the harmony of the
creation in effect challenged him to attempt to approximate this
kindness in his relations with his fellow men Apart from provoking
humanitarianism primarily an ethical experience guided not by
sentimentality but by reason and practicality Franklins natural
religionlike deism in generalfailed as scriptural religion does
not to establish a union between theology the religious life and
ethical behavior It must be seen that Franklin had no confidence in
achieving the good life through mere fellowservice he continually
urged man to conquer passion through reason seeming to covet pagan
sobriety more than he did the satisfaction of having aided man to
achieve greater physical ease If he felt that to relieve the
misfortunes of our fellow creatures is concurring with the Deity it is
godlikei he warned against helping those who had failed to help
themselves implying that the inner growth of the individual is more
significant than his outward charity to others Whatever be the ultimate
resolution of these antithetic principles we see that his
humanitarianism was the offspring of his a priori conceived Deity
augmented by his experiments in science which led to discovery of
natures laws His emphasis on the inward and vertical growth of the
individual toward perfection on the other hand may be viewed as the
expression of the introspective force of his Puritan heritage and his
knowledge direct and indirect of classical literature As in the
polarity of his thoughts concerning Providence so here we see that the
modus operandi of his mind is explicable in terms of the interplay of
the old and the new Greek paganism Socratic selfknowledge and
Christianity and the rationale of the Enlightenment

Before he became an economist a statesman a man of letters a
scientist he had embraced scientific deism primarily impelled by
Newtonianism We have observed that it is not improbable that his
agrarianism emphasis on free trade and tendency toward laissez faire
were partially at least the result of his efforts to parallel in
economics the harmony of the physical order Likewise his views on
education were conditioned by his faith in intellectual progress in the
might of Reason which in turn was in part the result of his scientific
deism Then too it may well be suggested that his theories of rhetoric
were to some degree the result of his rationalistic and scientific
habits of mind We have also seen that his scientific deism was among
the motivating factors of his belief in natural rights which coupled
with his empirical awareness of concrete economic and political abuses
issuing from monarchy and imperialistic parliamentarians made him alive
to the sovereignty of the people in their demands for civil and
political liberty This introduction it is hoped has made apparent the
fact that the growth of Franklins mind was a complex matter and that it
was moulded by a vast multitude of often diverse influences no one of
which alone completely explains him Puritanism classicism and
neoclassicism were all important influences Yet perhaps the modus
operandi of this myriadminded colonial this provincial Leonardo is
best explained in reference to the thought pattern of scientific deism
To see the reflection of Newton and his progeny in Franklins
activities be they economic political literary or philosophical
lends a compelling organic unity to the several sides of his genius
heretofore seen as unrelated Franklins mind represents an intellectual
coherencean imperfect counterpart to the physical harmony of the
Newtonian order of which all through his life he was a disciple

Footnote i Primitivism and the Idea of Progress in English Popular
Literature of the Eighteenth Century  One inference that might
be drawn from the theory was that while the infant whose mind is a blank
page at birth is not so well off from the primitivistic point of view as
the one who comes into the world already equipped with a complete set of
the laws of nature and a predisposition to obey them he is infinitely
better off than the infant whose poor little mind had been loaded with
original sin by his remote ancestors For the orthodox baby born in
sin there is almost no hope except in supernatural aid but if we
suppose that mans ideas are all derived as Locke postulated from
senseimpressions then we may conclude that all men rich and poor
primitive and civilized are on an equal footing intellectually at
birth Although the primitive child does not have the help of
civilization in the development of his mind neither does he have its
superstitions prejudices and corrupting influences and he might
actually be better off than the product of civilizationat least so
many a primitivist argued But one might draw another inference from the
tabula rasa theory Men however corrupt they are now may still have

Footnote i Franklin was unable to prevail upon Johnson to accept
the provostship of the Academy In  he printed Johnsons Elementa
Philosophica and suggested in Idea of the English School that it be
used in the Academy In a letter of  Franklin informs Johnson that
the grammatical and mathematical parts were already being usedthe rest
would be when the instructors and pupils were ready for it E E
Beardsley Life and Correspondence of S Johnson D D d ed New
York   In the Elementa Philosophica Johnson stresses the
use of mathematics in mans study of nature p xv Through
mathematics an indispensable aid in considering that wonderful and
amazing Power that Allcomprehending Wisdom that inimitable Beauty
that surprizing Harmony that immutable Order which abundantly discover
themselves in the Formation and Government of the Universe we are led
to their divine Original who is the unexhausted Source the glorious
Fountain of all Perfection  ibid xiii The Elementa is a
rhapsodic manual extolling the discovery of the Deity in his Work
through the study of the physical laws of the creation Although
subordinated to this there are frequent reactions against Lockian
sensationalism suggesting an ecstatic mystical union between man and
God On the whole the volume is a treatise on the glories of a natural
religion a religion of course which buttresses rather than refutes
scriptural religion

Footnote i Quoted in T H Montgomerys A History of the
University of Pennsylvania  Smiths educational principles may be
partially seen in his View of the Philosophy Schools  printed in
H W Smiths Life and Correspondence of the Rev William Smith
Philadelphia  I  f Although he conceived Nature as affording
only those fainter exhibitions of the Deity I  he was a sturdy
orthodox rationalist tending toward yet not embracing deism
Emphasizing the principal writings of Barrow Maclaurin Watts Keill
Locke Hutcheson sGravesande Martin Desaguliers Rohault Clarkes
edition Ray Derham and Sir Isaac Newton Smith suggests the
rationalist who buttresses scriptural revelation with the evidences of
Deity through discovery by reason of the Workman in the Work His
Discourses on Public Occasions in America d ed London  are
the result of his office as Head of a seminary of learning
Philadelphia Academy and College in order to advance the interests of
Science and therewith the interests of true Christianity p vi A
General Idea of the College of Mirania  though written about
 while Smith was in New York suggests the form of his View he
observes that besides his revealed will God has given intimations of
his will to us by appealing to our senses in the constitution of our
nature and the constitution and harmony of the material universe
Discourses  The same titles and authors are listed as in the
View A Newtonian rationalist Smith meditated All thy works with
unceasing voice echo forth thy wondrous praises The splendid sun with
the unnumbered orbs of heaven thro the pathless void repeat their
unwearied circuits that to the uttermost bounds of the universe they
may proclaim Thee the source of justest order and unabating harmony
ibid  Smith arrived at his principles of rationalism
apparently without indebtedness to Franklin there seems to be no
evidence that as provost he was merely attempting to fulfill the
scientific and rationalistic ideas latent in Franklins Proposals
that he was a tool in Franklins hands Indeed they were anything but
friendly to one another Hence one feels that the credit for the
relatively modern curriculum should be given more abundantly to Smith
than to Franklin

Footnote i Franklin found in an appendix to Greenwoods English
Grammar and in the Memorabilia specimens of the Socratic method which
influenced him to adopt the manner of the humble inquirer and doubter
to write and harangue with a modest diffidence On several occasions
he approvingly quotes Popes rule to speak tho sure with seeming
Diffidence Jefferson recognized Franklins use of this kind of
Machiavellian diffidence noting It was one of the rules which above
all others made Dr Franklin the most amiable of men in society never
to contradict anybody and that if he was urged to announce an
opinion he did it rather by asking questions as if for information or
by suggesting doubts In the Autobiography Franklin sees the Socratic
method as a necessary ally to doing good observing that many who mean
to be helpful lessen their power of doing good by a positive assuming
manner that seldom fails to disgust tends to create opposition and to
defeat every one of those purposes for which speech was given to us

Observations Concerning the Increase of Mankind when Smith in the
Wealth of Nations observes that colonial population doubles in every
twenty to twentyfive years it seems reasonable to infer that he was
beholden to Franklin for the suggestion It is within the realm of
reasonable inference says Mr Carey that Franklin did as Parton
urges help to educate Smith in the colonial point of view T D Eliot
in The Relations Between Adam Smith and Benjamin Franklin before 
Political Science Quarterly XXXIX  March  after calling
attention to the lack of extant correspondence between them and the
silence of their contemporaries concerning a vital relationship shows a
reasonable hesitancy in observing that little is known about Smiths
alleged debt to Franklin Like Wetzel and Carey Eliot thinks the debt
has been exaggerated He has been unable to prove Dr Pattens intuition

 Smiths major claim to fame  seems to rest on his elaborate

unified natural order operating according to natural law and if left
to its own course producing results beneficial to mankind p 
which suggests especially in Theory of Moral Sentiments that
selflove and social are the same When Smith came to write the Wealth
of Nations he tended Viner asserts to distrust the operations of the
harmonious natural orderyet Viner admits that many passages tend to
corroborate his earlier view expressed in Theory of Moral Sentiments
and that There is no possible room for doubt that Smith in general
believed that there was to say the least a stronger presumption
against government activity beyond its fundamental duties of protection
against its foreign foes and maintenance of justice p  We shall
see elsewhere that Franklin seems to have urged a less frugal
governmental restraint in activities other than economic

Carey  Another reference is found in a letter of  to Alexander

    cloth in favor of her own clothiers

    In order to do this she forbids the importation of foreign

    Then the silkworkers complain of a decay of trade

notes Franklin in several places On the Labouring Poor and in a

free trade is however antithetical to Mandevilles dog eat dog
basis See Kayes Intro to The Fable of the Bees xcviii ff
Franklin in no uncertain terms looks upon trade restrictions definitely
as the result of the abominable selfishness of men VII  As long
as selfishness is the rule mercantilism not economic laissez faire
will be king It is theoretically probable also that belief in mans
innate altruism could furnish emotional if not logical sanction for
laissez fairebut this abstraction is in Franklins case futile since
like Swift he was not blind to mans malevolence

Footnote i Even this fragmentary view of the more obvious economic
principles held by Franklin offers convincing evidence that had he been
less incidentally an economist he would have been at least a lesser Adam
Smith Mr Wetzel in Benjamin Franklin as an Economist offers a
convenient summary of Franklin as an economist some items suggesting
aspects of his views which had space permitted we should have included
in this study  Money as coin may have a value higher than its
bullion value  Natural interest is determined by the rent of so much
land as the money loaned will buy  High wages are not inconsistent
with a large foreign trade  Population will increase as the means of
gaining a living increase  A high standard of living serves to
prolong single life and thus acts as a check upon the increase of
population  People are adjusted among the different countries
according to the comparative wellbeing of mankind  The value of an
article is determined by the amount of labor necessary to produce the
food consumed in making the article  While manufactures are
advantageous only agriculture is truly productive  Manufactures will
naturally spring up in a country as the country becomes ripe for them
 Free trade with the world will give the greatest return at the least
expense  Wherever practicable State revenue should be raised by
direct taxes

mind but it vigorously asserts that this justness of mind is more
important than speculative science p  Antisensational it denies
that all our ideas come through sense p  affirming that we have
within us ideas of things p  It is uncertain of the value of
induction which is never a certain means of acquiring perfect
knowledge p  see also     It accords little
praise to the sciences and reason and seems wary of metaphysical
speculation assuring more humbly that Piety wisdom moderation are
without doubt the most estimable qualities in the world p  As we
shall discover this work on the whole seems to have had with the
exception of the last very general principle little formative influence
on the young mind which was fast impregnating itself with scientific
deism Were it not for the recurring implications particularly in the
harvest of editions of the Autobiography that La logique is as
significant for our study as for example the works of Locke and
Shaftesbury this note would be pedantic supererogation

Franklins fondness for Socratic centrality discipline and knowledge
of self is fragmentarily shown by the aphorisms appropriated in Poor

lives carnally wont live eternally Who has deceived thee so oft as

popular in the American colonies Franklin could have read that The

While the references to Thomson are few in the complete works his later
influence on Franklin need not be underestimated See Franklins letter
to W Strahan Writings II  in which he confesses that That
charming Poet has brought more Tears of Pleasure into my Eyes than all I
ever read before It is not inconceivable that in Thomson Franklin
found additional sanction for his humanitarian bias One remembers the
wide differences between the humanitarianism of Thomson and Franklin
Franklins practical and masculinehumanitarianism keyed to the saving
of time and energy was unlike the sentimental warmheartedness often
displayed by Thomson Franklin was never moved to tears at beholding the
worms convulsive twist in agonizing folds

improving and perfecting their laws Faith he calls an unintelligible
Chymra of the Phantasie p  The doctrine of the Trinity is one
of the most nice Inventions that ever the subtlest Virtuoso construd to
puzzle the Wit of Man with p  Through faith people make of God
only a confusd unintelligible Description of a Heterogeneous Monster
of their own Making p  Deistically he opines that we shall soon
see that the Object of True Religion and all Rational Mens
Speculations is an Eternal Unchangeable Omnipotent Being infinitely
Good Just and Wise p  Like Toland he urges To pretend to
Believe a Thing or the Working of a Miracle is a stupid and gaping
Astonishment p  Although he enjoyed Franklins dissertation he
does not in his work hold to Franklins necessitarianism Nothing
interrupts Men but only as they interrupt one another p 
Religion to Lyons is remote from books but is found in the unalterable
laws of Nature which no Authority can destroy or Interpolator corrupt

Footnote i Although Franklin indicates in his Autobiography that
he delighted to listen to Mandeville hold forth at the Horns there
seems to be traceable in his writings no direct influence of
Mandevilles thought One may wonder whether Franklins use of the name
Horatio in his  dialogues between Philocles and Horatio could be
traced to Mandevilles use of the name in his dialogues between
Cleomenes and Horatio Mandevilles empirical view of mans essential
egoism would have found sympathetic response from Franklin On the other
hand Mandevilles ethical rigorism see Kayes Introd to The Fable of
the Bees differs from the utilitarian cast Franklin sheds over his
strenuous ethicism One may suspect that like a Bunyan a Swift a
Rabelais Mandeville would have fortified Franklin against accepting too
blithely Shaftesburys faith in mans innate altruism even if he did
not shortcircuit Franklins growing humanitarianism

Footnote i Not to be neglected in a summary of the factors
influencing Franklin during his youth is Quakerism Taught in Boston to
suspect the Quakers in Philadelphia in the midst of their stronghold he
came soon one may imagine to have a sympathetic regard for them
Quakerism in its antagonism towards sacraments and ceremonies in its
emphasis on the priesthood of every man and the right of private
judgment in its strenuous effort to promote fellowservice was
congenial to the young printer reacting against Presbyterianism Like
the radical thought of the age Quakerism refused first place to
scriptural revelation which became secondary to the light within the
dictates of ones heart Often we may suspect the light within was
blended with the concept in deism that regardless of the promptings of
scripture each man has within him a natural sense which enables him to
apprehend the truths of nature The effort of deism to simplify religion
was historically shared by Quakerism During the years we have under
consideration Franklin was endeavoring to make a simple worship out of
the subtle theology which had been offered him during his early years
Presbyterianism had frowned upon a covenant of works Quakerism
attempted to express its covenant with God in terms of human kindliness
fellowship and service

Stressing toleration the universality of natural religion morality
rather than theology reason rather than faith Masonry could easily
have augmented these ideas as they were latent or already developed in
Franklins mind Scholars have yet to work out the extent to which
Freemasonry yokefellow of deism reinforced free thought and was one of
the subversive forces breaking down colonial orthodoxy B Fas
Revolution and Freemasonry  neglects nonpolitical
influences of Freemasonry

Although there is no evidence that Franklin as early as  read such
works popular in the colonies as De Ramsays The Travels of Cyrus
and Rowes translation of The Golden Sayings of Pythagoras the manner
in which oriental lore augmented science and Masonry in fostering deism
is an intriguing problem in eighteenthcentury colonial letters

III BIOGRAPHIES

Becker Carl Benjamin Franklin in Dictionary of American
  Biography New York  VI  The most authoritative brief
  biography

Bruce W C Benjamin Franklin SelfRevealed  vols New York
   In spite of occasional extravagant statements and a
  conservative temperament preventing him from discussing Franklins
  religion with sympathetic and historical insight Mr Bruce has
  provided a brilliant and perspicuous survey Selfrevealed fails to
  do justice to Bruces incisive commentary

Fa Bernard Franklin the Apostle of Modern Times Boston  A
  readable critical biography said to be based on six hundred to nine
  hundred unpublished letters Would have been more useful had it been
  given scholarly documentation Some new light on Franklins Masonic
  activities and his efforts during  to effect the growth of a
  British empire Fa used the FranklinGalloway correspondence in the
  W S Mason and W L Clements collections Believes that Franklin
  was a follower of the seventeenthcentury English Pythagoreans
  since this belief is largely undocumented one feels it curious that
  Pythagoreanism should bulk larger than the pattern of thought provoked
  by Locke and Newton See very critical reviews by H M Jones in
  American Literature II  Nov  and W C Bruce
  American Historical Review XXXV  ff April  The latter
  concludes that there is very little indeed in the text of the book
  under review that makes any unquestionably substantial addition to our
  preexisting knowledge of Franklin or is marked by anything that can
  be termed freshness of interpretation

Fa Bernard The Two Franklins Fathers of American Democracy
  Boston  Charmingly spirited portrait of patriarchal Franklin of
  Passy reworking of materials in Franklin the Apostle of Modern
  Times Fas habit of mingling quotation paraphrase and intuition
  in use of Baches Diary suggests untrustworthy documentation The
  second Franklin is of course Benjamin Franklin Bache  son
  of Sally Franklin and Richard Bache editor of the republican Aurora
  General Advertiser For a judicial unsympathetic review see A
  Guerards in the New York Herald Tribune Books Oct   J A
  Krout in the American Historical Review XXXIX  July

From the AUTOBIOGRAPHY

                     TWYFORD at the Bishop of St Asaphs 

DEAR SON I have ever had a Pleasure in obtaining any little Anecdotes
of my Ancestors You may remember the Enquiries I made among the Remains
of my Relations when you were with me in England and the journey I
undertook for that purpose Now imagining it may be equally agreable to
you to know the Circumstances of my Life many of which you are yet
unacquainted with and expecting a Weeks uninterrupted Leisure in my
present Country Retirement I sit down to write them for you To which I
have besides some other Inducements Having emergd from the Poverty and
Obscurity in which I was born and bred to a State of Affluence and some
Degree of Reputation in the World and having gone so far thro Life
with a considerable Share of Felicity the conducing Means I made use
of which with the Blessing of God so well succeeded my Posterity may
like to know as they may find some of them suitable to their own
Situations and therefore fit to be imitated That Felicity when I
reflected on it has inducd me sometimes to say that were it offerd
to my Choice I should have no Objection to a Repetition of the same
Life from its Beginning only asking the Advantages Authors have in a
second Edition to correct some Faults of the first So would I if I
might besides correcting the Faults change some sinister Accidents
and Events of it for others more favourable but tho this were denyd
I should still accept the Offer However since such a Repetition is not
to be expected the next Thing most like living ones Life over again
seems to be a Recollection of that Life and to make that Recollection
as durable as possible the putting it down in Writing Hereby too I
shall indulge the Inclination so natural in old Men to be talking of
themselves and their own past Actions and I shall indulge it without
being troublesome to others who thro respect to Age might think
themselves obligd to give me a Hearing since this may be read or not
as any one pleases And lastly I may as well confess it since my
Denial of it will be believd by no Body perhaps I shall a good deal
gratify my own Vanity Indeed I scarce ever heard or saw the
introductory Words Without vanity I may say c but some vain thing
immediately followd Most People dislike Vanity in others whatever
share they have of it themselves but I give it fair Quarter wherever I
meet with it being persuaded that it is often productive of Good to the
Possessor and to others that are within his Sphere of Action And
therefore in many Cases it would not be quite absurd if a Man were to
thank God for his Vanity among the other Comforts of Life

And now I speak of thanking God I desire with all Humility to
acknowledge that I owe the mentiond Happiness of my past Life to his
kind Providence which led me to the Means I usd and gave them Success
My Belief of this induces me to hope tho I must not presume that
the same Goodness will still be exercisd towards me in continuing that
Happiness or in enabling me to bear a fatal Reverse which I may
experience as others have done the Complexion of my future Fortune
being known to him only in whose Power it is to bless to us even our
Afflictions

The Notes one of my Uncles who had the same kind of Curiosity in
collecting Family Anecdotes once put into my Hands furnishd me with
several Particulars relating to our Ancestors From these Notes I learnt
that the Family had livd in the same Village Ecton in
Northamptonshire for  Years and how much longer he knew not
perhaps from the Time when the Name Franklin that before was the name
of an Order of People was assumd by them for a Surname when others
took surnames all over the kingdom on a Freehold of about  Acres
aided by the Smiths Business which had continued in the Family till
his Time the eldest son being always bred to that Business A Custom
which he and my Father both followed as to their eldest SonsWhen I
searchd the Register at Ecton I found an Account of their Births
Marriages and Burials from the Year  only there being no Register
kept in that Parish at any time precedingBy that Register I
perceivd that I was the youngest Son of the youngest Son for 
Generations back My Grandfather Thomas who was born in  lived at
Ecton till he grew too old to follow Business longer when he went to
live with his Son John a Dyer at Banbury in Oxfordshire with whom my
Father servd an Apprenticeship There my Grandfather died and lies
buried We saw his Gravestone in  His eldest Son Thomas livd in
the House at Ecton and left it with the Land to his only Child a
Daughter who with her Husband one Fisher of Wellingborough sold it to
Mr Isted now Lord of the Manor there My Grandfather had  Sons that
grew up viz Thomas John Benjamin and Josiah I will give you what
Account I can of them at this distance from my Papers and if these are
not lost in my Absence you will among them find many more Particulars
Thomas was bred a Smith under his Father but being ingenious and
encouragd in Learning as all his Brothers likewise were by an Esquire
Palmer then the principal Gentleman in that Parish he qualifyd himself
for the Business of Scrivener became a considerable Man in the County
Affairs was a chief Mover of all publick Spirited Undertakings for the
County or Town of Northampton and his own village of which many
instances were told us and he was at Ecton much taken Notice of and
patronizd by the then Lord Halifax He died in  Jan  old Stile
just  Years to a Day before I was born The Account we receivd of his
Life and Character from some old People at Ecton I remember struck you
as something extraordinary from its Similarity to what you knew of
mine Had he died on the same Day you said one might have supposd a
TransmigrationJohn was bred a Dyer I believe of Woollens Benjamin
was bred a Silk Dyer serving an Apprenticeship at London He was an
ingenious Man I remember him well for when I was a Boy he came over to
my Father in Boston and lived in the House with us some Years He lived
to a great Age His Grandson Samuel Franklin now lives in Boston He
left behind him two Quarto Volumes MS of his own Poetry consisting of
little occasional Pieces addressd to his Friends and Relations of
which the following sent to me is a Specimen Although Franklin wrote
in the margin Here insert it the poetry is not given He had formd
a Shorthand of his own which he taught me but never practising it I
have now forgot it I was namd after this Uncle there being a
particular Affection between him and my Father He was very pious a
great Attender of Sermons of the best Preachers which he took down in
his Shorthand and had with him many Volumes of them He was also much of
a Politician too much perhaps for his Station There fell lately into
my Hands in London a Collection he had made of all the principal
Pamphlets relating to Publick Affairs from  to  Many of the
Volumes are wanting as appears by the Numbering but there still
remains  Vols Folio and  in to and voA Dealer in old Books
met with them and knowing me by my sometimes buying of him he brought
them to me It seems my Uncle must have left them here when he went to
America which was above  years since There are many of his Notes in
the Margins

This obscure Family of ours was early in the Reformation and continud
Protestants thro the Reign of Queen Mary when they were sometimes in
Danger of Trouble on Account of their Zeal against Popery They had got
an English Bible and to conceal and secure it it was fastened open
with Tapes under and within the Frame of a Joint Stool When my Great
Great Grandfather read it it to his Family he turnd up the joint
Stool upon his Knees turning over the Leaves then under the Tapes One
of the Children stood at the Door to give Notice if he saw the Apparitor
coming who was an Officer of the Spiritual Court In that Case the
Stool was turnd down again upon its feet when the Bible remaind
conceald under it as before This Anecdote I had from my Uncle
BenjaminThe Family continud all of the Church of England till about
the End of Charles the ds Reign when some of the Ministers that had
been outed for Nonconformity holding Conventicles in Northamptonshire
Benjamin and Josiah adherd to them and so continud all their Lives
The rest of the Family remaind with the Episcopal Church

Josiah my father married young and carried his Wife with three
Children into New England about  The Conventicles having been
forbidden by Law and frequently disturbed induced some considerable
Men of his Acquaintance to remove to that Country and he was prevaild
with to accompany them thither where they expected to enjoy their Mode
of Religion with FreedomBy the same Wife he had  Children more born
there and by a second wife ten more in all  of which I remember 
sitting at one time at his Table who all grew up to be Men and Women
and married I was the youngest Son and the youngest Child but two and
was born in Boston N England My mother the d wife was Abiah
Folger a daughter of Peter Folger one of the first Settlers of New
England of whom honourable mention is made by Cotton Mather in his
Church History of that Country entitled Magnalia Christi Americana as
a godly learned Englishman if I remember the Words rightly I have
heard that he wrote sundry small occasional Pieces but only one of them
was printed which I saw now many years since It was written in  in
the homespun Verse of that Time and People and addressd to those then
concernd in the Government there It was in favour of Liberty of
Conscience and in behalf of the Baptists Quakers and other Sectaries
that had been under Persecution ascribing the Indian Wars and other
Distresses that had befallen the Country to that Persecution as so
many Judgments of God to punish so heinous an Offense and exhorting a
Repeal of those uncharitable Laws The whole appeard to me as written
with a good deal of Decent Plainness and manly Freedom The six last
concluding Lines I remember tho I have forgotten the two first of the
Stanza but the Purport of them was that his Censures proceeded from
Good will and therefore he would be known as the Author

    Because to be a Libeller says he
      I hate it with my Heart
    FromA Sherburne Town where now I dwell
      My Name I do put here
    Without Offense your real Friend
      It is Peter Folgier

  A In MS Franklin notes In the Island of Nantucket

My elder Brothers were all put Apprentices to different Trades I was
put to the Grammar School at Eight Years of Age my Father intending to
devote me as the Tithe of his Sons to the Service of the Church My
early Readiness in learning to read which must have been very early as
I do not remember when I could not read and the Opinion of all his
Friends that I should certainly make a good Scholar encouragd him in
this Purpose of his My Uncle Benjamin too approvd of it and proposd
to give me all his Shorthand Volumes of Sermons I suppose as a Stock to
set up with if I would learn his Character I continud however at the
Grammar School not quite one Year tho in that time I had risen
gradually from the Middle of the Class of that Year to be the Head of
it and farther was removd into the next Class above it in order to go
with that into the third at the End of the Year But my Father in the
mean time from a View of the Expence of a College Education which
having so large a Family he could not well afford and the mean Living
many so educated were afterwards able to obtain Reasons that he gave to
his Friends in my Hearing altered his first Intention took me from the
Grammar School and sent me to a School for Writing and Arithmetic kept
by a then famous Man Mr Geo Brownell very successful in his
Profession generally and that by mild encouraging Methods Under him I
acquired fair Writing pretty soon but I faild in the Arithmetic and
made no Progress in itAt Ten Years old I was taken home to assist my
Father in his Business which was that of a Tallow Chandler and Sope
Boiler A Business he was not bred to but had assumed on his Arrival in
New England and on finding his Dying Trade would not maintain his
Family being in little Request Accordingly I was employed in cutting
Wick for the Candles filling the Dipping Mold and the Molds for cast
Candles attending the Shop going of Errands etcI dislikd the
Trade and had a strong Inclination for the Sea but my Father declard
against it however living near the Water I was much in and about it
learnt early to swim well and to manage Boats and when in a Boat or
Canoe with other Boys I was commonly allowd to govern especially in
any case of Difficulty and upon other Occasions I was generally a
Leader among the Boys and sometimes led them into Scrapes of wch I
will mention one Instance as it shows an early projecting public
Spirit tho not then justly conducted There was a salt Marsh that
bounded part of the Mill Pond on the Edge of which at Highwater we
usd to stand to fish for Minnows By much Trampling we had made it a
mere Quagmire My Proposal was to build a Wharff there fit for us to
stand upon and I showd my Comrades a large Heap of Stones which were
intended for a new House near the Marsh and which would very well suit
our Purpose Accordingly in the Evening when the Workmen were gone I
assembled a Number of my Playfellows and working with them diligently
like so many Emmets sometimes two or three to a Stone we brought them
all away and built our little WharffThe next Morning the Workmen were
surprizd at Missing the Stones which were found in our Wharff Enquiry
was made after the Removers we were discovered and complaind of
several of us were corrected by our Fathers and tho I pleaded the
Usefulness of the Work mine convincd me that nothing was useful which
was not honest

I think you may like to know something of his Person and Character He
had an excellent Constitution of Body was of middle Stature but well
set and very strong He was ingenious could draw prettily was skilld
a little in Music and had a clear pleasing Voice so that when he playd
Psalm Tunes on his Violin and sung withal as he sometimes did in an
Evening after the Business of the Day was over it was extreamly
agreable to hear He had a mechanical Genius too and on occasion was
very handy in the Use of other Tradesmens Tools But his great
Excellence lay in a sound Understanding and solid Judgment in
prudential Matters both in private and publick Affairs In the latter
indeed he was never employed the numerous Family he had to educate and
the straitness of his Circumstances keeping him close to his Trade but
I remember well his being frequently visited by leading People who
consulted him for his Opinion in Affairs of the Town or of the Church he
belongd to and showd a good deal of Respect for his Judgment and
advice He was also much consulted by private Persons about their
affairs when any Difficulty occurrd and frequently chosen an
Arbitrator between contending PartiesAt his Table he likd to have as
often as he could some sensible Friend or Neighbour to converse with
and always took care to start some ingenious or useful Topic for
Discourse which might tend to improve the Minds of his Children By
this means he turnd our Attention to what was good just and prudent
in the Conduct of Life and little or no Notice was ever taken of what
related to the Victuals on the Table whether it was well or ill drest
in or out of season of good or bad flavour preferable or inferior to
this or that other thing of the kind so that I was brot up in such a
perfect Inattention to those Matters as to be quite Indifferent what
kind of Food was set before me and so unobservant of it that to this
Day if I am askd I can scarce tell a few Hours after Dinner what I
dind upon This has been a Convenience to me in travelling where my
Companions have been sometimes very unhappy for want of a suitable
Gratification of their more delicate because better instructed
tastes and appetites

My Mother had likewise an excellent Constitution She suckled all her 
Children I never knew either my Father or Mother to have any Sickness
but that of which they dyd he at  and she at  years of age They
lie buried together at Boston where I some years since placed a Marble
Stone over their Grave with this Inscription

                JOSIAH FRANKLIN
               And ABIAH his Wife
                Lie here interred

                Fiftyfive Years

          By constant labour and Industry
               With Gods blessing
          They maintained a large Family
                  Comfortably
         And brought up thirteen Children
             And seven Grandchildren
                   Reputably

By my rambling Digressions I perceive myself to be grown old I usd to
write more methodicallyBut one does not dress for private Company as
for a publick Ball Tis perhaps only Negligence

To return I continud thus employd in my Fathers Business for two
Years that is till I was  Years old and my Brother John who was
bred to that Business having left my Father married and set up for
himself at Rhodeisland there was all Appearance that I was destind to
supply his Place and be a Tallow Chandler But my Dislike to the Trade
continuing my Father was under Apprehensions that if he did not find
one for me more agreable I should break away and get to Sea as his Son
Josiah had done to his great Vexation He therefore sometimes took me to
walk with him and see Joiners Bricklayers Turners Braziers etc at
their Work that he might observe my Inclination and endeavour to fix
it on some Trade or other on Land It has ever since been a Pleasure to
me to see good Workmen handle their Tools and it has been useful to me
having learnt so much by it as to be able to do little Jobs myself in
my House when a Workman could not readily be got and to construct
little Machines for my Experiments while the Intention of making the
Experiment was fresh and warm in my Mind My Father at last fixd upon
the Cutlers Trade and my Uncle Benjamins Son Samuel who was bred to
that Business in London being about that time establishd in Boston
I was sent to be with him some time on liking But his Expectations of a
Fee with me displeasing my Father I was taken home again

From a Child I was fond of Reading and all the little Money that came
into my Hands was ever laid out in Books Pleasd with the Pilgrims
Progress my first Collection was of John Bunyans Works in separate
little Volumes I afterwards sold them to enable me to buy R Burtons
Historical Collections they were small Chapmens Books and cheap  or
 in allMy Fathers little Library consisted chiefly of Books in
polemic Divinity most of which I read and have since often regretted
that at a time when I had such a Thirst for Knowledge more proper Books
had not fallen in my Way since it was now resolvd I should not be a
Clergyman Plutarchs Lives there was in which I read abundantly and I
still think that time spent to great Great seems to have been
deleted Advantage There was also a Book of Defoes called an Essay
on Projects and another of Dr Mathers called Essays to do Good which
perhaps gave me a Turn of thinking that had an influence on some of the
principal future Events of my Life

This Bookish inclination at length determind my Father to make me a
Printer tho he had already one Son James of that Profession In 
my Brother James returnd from England with a Press and Letters to set
up his Business in Boston I likd it much better than that of my
Father but still had a Hankering for the SeaTo prevent the
apprehended Effect of such an Inclination my Father was impatient to
have me bound to my Brother I stood out some time but at last was
persuaded and signed the Indentures when I was yet but  Years oldI
was to serve as an Apprentice till I was  Years of Age only I was to
be allowd Journeymans Wages during the last Year In a little time I
made great Proficiency in the Business and became a useful Hand to my
Brother I now had Access to better Books An Acquaintance with the
Apprentices of Booksellers enabled me sometimes to borrow a small one
which I was careful to return soon and clean Often I sat up in my Room
reading the greatest Part of the Night when the Book was borrowd in
the Evening and to be returnd early in the Morning lest it should be
missd or wanted And after some time an ingenious Tradesman Mr Matthew
Adams who had a pretty Collection of Books and who frequented our
Printing House took Notice of me invited me to his Library and very
kindly lent me such Books as I chose to read I now took a Fancy to
Poetry and made some little Pieces My Brother thinking it might turn
to account encouragd me and put me on composing two occasional
Ballads One was called The Lighthouse Tragedy and contained an Acct
of the drowning of Capt Worthilake with his Two Daughters the other
was a Sailor Song on the Taking of Teach or Blackbeard the Pirate
They were wretched Stuff in the Grubstreet Ballad Stile and when they
were printed he sent me about the Town to sell them The first sold
wonderfully the Event being recent having made a great Noise This
flatterd my Vanity But my Father discouragd me by ridiculing my
Performances and telling me Versemakers were generally Beggars so I
escapd being a Poet most probably a very bad one But as Prose Writing
has been of great Use to me in the Course of my Life and was a
principal Means of my Advancement I shall tell you how in such a
Situation I acquird what little Ability I have in that Way

There was another Bookish Lad in the Town John Collins by Name with
whom I was intimately acquainted We sometimes disputed and very fond
we were of Argument and very desirous of confuting one another Which
disputacious Turn by the way is apt to become a very bad Habit making
People often extreamly disagreeable in Company by the Contradiction
that is necessary to bring it into Practice and thence besides souring
and spoiling the Conversation is productive of Disgusts and perhaps
Enmities where you may have occasion for Friendship I had caught it by
reading my Fathers Books of Dispute about Religion Persons of good
Sense I have since observd seldom fall into it except Lawyers
University Men and Men of all Sorts that have been bred at Edinborough
A Question was once somehow or other started between Collins and me of
the Propriety of educating the Female Sex in Learning and their
Abilities for Study He was of Opinion that it was improper and that
they were naturally unequal to it I took the contrary Side perhaps a
little for Disputes sake He was naturally more eloquent had a
ready Plenty of Words and sometimes as I thought bore me down more by
his Fluency than by the Strength of his Reasons As we parted without
settling the Point and were not to see one another again for some time
I sat down to put my Arguments in Writing which I copied fair and sent
to him He answerd and I replyd Three of or four Letters of a Side
had passd when my Father happend to find my Papers and read them
Without entring into the Discussion he took occasion to talk to me
about the Manner of my Writing observd that tho I had the Advantage
of my Antagonist in correct Spelling and pointing which I owd to the
Printing House I fell far short in elegance of Expression in Method
and in Perspicuity of which he convincd me by several Instances I saw
the Justice of his Remarks and thence grew more attentive to the
Manner in writing and determind to endeavour at Improvement

About this time I met with an odd Volume of the Spectator It was the
Third I had never before seen any of them I bought it read it over
and over and was much delighted with it I thought the Writing
excellent and wishd if possible to imitate it With that View I took
some of the Papers and making short Hints of the Sentiment in each
Sentence laid them by a few Days and then without looking at the Book
tryd to compleat the Papers again by expressing each hinted Sentiment
at length and as fully as it had been expressd before in any suitable
Words that should come to hand

Then I compard my Spectator with the Original discoverd some of my
Faults and corrected them But I found I wanted a Stock of Words or a
Readiness in recollecting and using them which I thought I should have
acquird before that time if I had gone on making Verses since the
continual Occasion for Words of the same Import but of different Length
to suit the Measure or of different Sound for the Rhyme would have
laid me under a constant Necessity of searching for Variety and also
have tended to fix that Variety in my Mind and make me Master of it
Therefore I took some of the Tales and turnd them into Verse And after
a time when I had pretty well forgotten the Prose turnd them back
again I also sometimes jumbled my Collections of Hints into Confusion
and after some Weeks endeavourd to reduce them into the best Order
before I began to form the full Sentences and compleat the Paper This
was to teach me Method in the Arrangement of Thoughts By comparing my
work afterwards with the original I discoverd many faults and amended
them but I sometimes had the Pleasure of Fancying that in certain
Particulars of small Import I had been lucky enough to improve the
Method or the Language and this encouragd me to think I might possibly
in time come to be a tolerable English Writer of which I was extreamly
ambitious

My Time for these Exercises and for Reading was at Night after Work or
before it began in the Morning or on Sundays when I contrived to be in
the Printing House alone evading as much as I could the common
Attendance on publick Worship which my Father used to exact of me when
I was under his Care And which indeed I still thought a Duty tho I
could not as it seemed to me afford the Time to practise it

When about  Years of Age I happend to meet with a Book written by
one Tryon recommending a Vegetable Diet I determined to go into it My
Brother being yet unmarried did not keep House but boarded himself and
his Apprentices in another Family My refusing to eat Flesh occasioned
an Inconveniency and I was frequently chid for my singularity I made
myself acquainted with Tryons Manner of preparing some of his Dishes
such as Boiling Potatoes or Rice making Hasty Pudding and a few
others and then proposd to my Brother that if he would give me Weekly
half the Money he paid for my Board I would board myself He instantly
agreed to it and I presently found that I could save half what he paid
me This was an additional Fund for buying Books But I had another
Advantage in it My Brother and the rest going from the Printing House
to their Meals I remaind there alone and dispatching presently my
light Repast which often was no more than a Bisket or a Slice of
Bread a Handful of Raisins or a Tart from the Pastry Cooks and a
Glass of Water had the rest of the Time till their Return for Study
in which I made the greater Progress from that greater Clearness of
Head and quicker Apprehension which usually attend Temperance in Eating
and Drinking And now it was that being on some Occasion made ashamd of
my Ignorance in Figures which I had twice failed in Learning when at
School I took Cockers Book of Arithmetick and went thro the whole by
myself with great Ease I also read Sellers and Sturmys Books of
Navigation and became acquainted with the little Geometry they contain
but never proceeded far in that ScienceAnd I read about this Time
Locke on Human Understanding and the Art of Thinking by Messrs du Port
Royal

While I was intent on improving my Language I met with an English
Grammar I think it was Greenwoods at the End of which there were two
little Sketches of the Arts of Rhetoric and Logic the latter finishing
with a Specimen of a Dispute in the Socratic Method And soon after I
procurd Xenophons Memorable Things of Socrates wherein there are many
Instances of the same Method I was charmd with it adopted it dropt
my abrupt Contradiction and positive Argumentation and put on the
humble Enquirer and Doubter And being then from reading Shaftesbury
and Collins become a real Doubter in many Points of our religious
Doctrine I found this Method safest for myself and very embarrassing to
those against whom I usd it therefore I took a Delight in it
practisd it continually and grew very artful and expert in drawing
People even of superior Knowledge into Concessions the Consequences of
which they did not foresee entangling them in Difficulties out of which
they could not extricate themselves and so obtaining Victories that
neither myself nor my Cause always deservedI continud this Method
some few years but gradually left it retaining only the Habit of
expressing myself in Terms of modest Diffidence never using when I
advance any thing that may possibly be disputed the Words Certainly
undoubtedly or any others that give the Air of Positiveness to an
Opinion but rather say I conceive or I apprehend a Thing to be so or
so It appears to me or I should think it so or so for such and such
Reasons or I imagine it to be so or it is so if I am not mistaken
This Habit I believe has been of great Advantage to me when I have had
occasion to inculcate my Opinions and persuade Men into Measures that I
have been from time to time engagd in promotingAnd as the chief Ends
of Conversation are to inform or to be informed to please or to
persuade I wish wellmeaning sensible Men would not lessen their Power
of doing Good by a Positive assuming Manner that seldom fails to
disgust tends to create Opposition and to defeat every one of those
Purposes for which Speech was given us to wit giving or receiving
Information or Pleasure For if you would inform a positive
dogmatical Manner in advancing your Sentiments may provoke
Contradiction and prevent a candid Attention If you wish Information
and Improvement from the Knowledge of others and yet at the same time
express yourself as firmly fixd in your present Opinions modest
sensible Men who do not love Disputation will probably leave you
undisturbed in the Possession of your Error and by such a Manner you
can seldom hope to recommend yourself in pleasing your Hearers or to
persuade those whose Concurrence you desirePope says judiciously

    Men should be taught as if you taught them not
    And things unknown proposd as things forgot

farther recommending it to us

    To speak tho sure with seeming Diffidence

And he might have coupled with this Line that which he has coupled with
another I think less properly

    For want of Modesty is want of Sense

If you ask why less properly I must repeat the lines

    Immodest Words admit of no Defence
    For Want of Modesty is Want of Sense

Now is not Want of Sense where a Man is so unfortunate as to want it
some Apology for his Want of Modesty and would not the Lines stand
more justly thus

    Immodest Words admit but this Defence
    That Want of Modesty is Want of Sense

This however I should submit to better Judgments

My Brother had in  or  begun to print a Newspaper It was the
second that appeard in America and was called The New England
Courant The only one before it was the Boston News Letter I
remember his being dissuaded by some of his Friends from the
Undertaking as not likely to succeed one Newspaper being in their
Judgment enough for AmericaAt this time  there are not less than
five and twentyHe went on however with the Undertaking and after
having workd in composing the Types and printing off the Sheets I was
employd to carry the Papers thro the Streets to the CustomersHe had
some ingenious Men among his Friends who amusd themselves by writing
little Pieces for this Paper which gaind it Credit and made it more
in Demand and these Gentlemen often visited usHearing their
Conversations and their Accounts of the Approbation their Papers were
receivd with I was excited to try my Hand among them But being still
a Boy and suspecting that my Brother would object to printing any Thing
of mine in his Paper if he knew it to be mine I contrivd to disguise
my Hand and writing an anonymous Paper I put it in at Night under the
Door of the Printing House It was found in the Morning and communicated
to his Writing Friends when they calld in as usual They read it
commented on it in my Hearing and I had the exquisite Pleasure of
finding it met with their Approbation and that in their different
Guesses at the Author none were named but Men of some Character among us
for Learning and IngenuityI suppose now that I was rather lucky in my
Judges And that perhaps they were not really so very good ones as I
then esteemd them Encouragd however by this I wrote and conveyd in
the same Way to the Press several more Papers which were equally
approvd and I kept my Secret till my small Fund of Sense for such
Performances was pretty well exhausted and then I discovered it when I
began to be considered a little more by my Brothers Acquaintance and
in a manner that did not quite please him as he thought probably with
reason that it tended to make me too vain And perhaps this might be
one Occasion of the Differences that we began to have about this Time
Tho a Brother he considered himself as my Master and me as his
Apprentice and accordingly expected the same Services from me as he
would from another while I thought he demeand me too much in some he
requird of me who from a Brother expected more Indulgence Our
Disputes were often brought before our Father and I fancy I was either
generally in the right or else a better Pleader because the Judgment
was generally in my favour But my Brother was passionate and had often
beaten me which I took extreamly amiss and thinking my Apprenticeship
very tedious I was continually wishing for some Opportunity of
shortening it which at length offered in a manner unexpectedB

  B I fancy his harsh and tyrannical Treatment of me might be a
  means of impressing me with that Aversion to arbitrary Power
  that has stuck to me thro my whole life Franklins note

One of the Pieces in our Newspaper on some political Point which I have
now forgotten gave Offence to the Assembly He was taken up censurd
and imprisond for a Month by the Speakers Warrant I suppose because
he would not discover his Author I too was taken up and examind before
the Council but tho I did not give them any Satisfaction they
contented themselves with admonishing me and dismissd me considering
me perhaps as an Apprentice who was bound to keep his Masters Secrets
During my Brothers Confinement which I resented a good deal
notwithstanding our private Differences I had the Management of the
Paper and I made bold to give our Rulers some Rubs in it which my
Brother took very kindly while others began to consider me in an
unfavourable Light as a young Genius that had a Turn for Libelling and
Satyr My Brothers Discharge was accompanyd with an Order of the
House a very odd one that James Franklin should no longer print the
Paper called the New England Courant There was a Consultation held in
our Printing House among his Friends what he should do in this Case
Some proposd to evade the Order by changing the Name of the Paper but
my Brother seeing Inconveniences in that it was finally concluded on
as a better Way to let it be printed for the future under the Name of
Benjamin Franklin And to avoid the Censure of the Assembly that might
fall on him as still printing it by his Apprentice the Contrivance
was that my old Indenture should be returnd to me with a full
Discharge on the Back of it to be shown on Occasion but to secure to
him the Benefit of my Service I was to sign new Indentures for the
Remainder of the Term wch were to be kept private A very flimsy
Scheme it was but however it was immediately executed and the Paper
went on accordingly under my Name for several Months At length a fresh
Difference arising between my Brother and me I took upon me to assert
my Freedom presuming that he would not venture to produce the new
Indentures It was not fair in me to take this Advantage and this I
therefore reckon one of the first Errata of my life But the Unfairness
of it weighed little with me when under the Impressions of Resentment
for the Blows his Passion too often urgd him to bestow upon me Tho he
was otherwise not an illnaturd Man Perhaps I was too saucy and
provoking

When he found I would leave him he took care to prevent my getting
Employment in any other PrintingHouse of the Town by going round and
speaking to every Master who accordingly refusd to give me Work I
then thought of going to New York as the nearest Place where there was a
Printer and I was the rather inclind to leave Boston when I reflected
that I had already made myself a little obnoxious to the governing
Party and from the arbitrary Proceedings of the Assembly in my
Brothers Case it was likely I might if I stayd soon bring myself into
Scrapes and farther that my indiscrete Disputations about Religion
began to make me pointed at with Horror by good People as an Infidel or
Atheist I determind on the Point but my Father now siding with my
Brother I was sensible that if I attempted to go openly Means would be
used to prevent me My Friend Collins therefore undertook to manage a
little for me He agreed with the Captain of a New York Sloop for my
Passage under the Notion of my being a young Acquaintance of his that
had got a naughty Girl with Child whose Friends would compel me to
marry her and therefore I could not appear or come away publickly So I
sold some of my Books to raise a little Money Was taken on board
privately and as we had a fair Wind in three Days I found myself in
New York near  Miles from home a Boy of but  without the least
Recommendation to or Knowledge of any Person in the Place and with very
little Money in my Pocket

My Inclinations for the Sea were by this time worne out or I might now
have gratifyd them But having a Trade and supposing myself a pretty
good Workman I offerd my Service to the Printer in the Place old Mr
Wm Bradford who had been the first Printer in Pensilvania but removd
from thence upon the Quarrel of Geo KeithHe could give me no
Employment having little to do and Help enough already But says he
my Son at Philadelphia has lately lost his principal Hand Aquila Rose
by Death If you go thither I believe he may employ youPhiladelphia
was  Miles farther I set out however in a Boat for Amboy leaving
my Chest and Things to follow me round by Sea In crossing the Bay we
met with a Squall that tore our rotten Sails to pieces prevented our
getting into the Kill and drove us upon Long Island In our Way a
drunken Dutchman who was a Passenger too fell overboard when he was
sinking I reachd thro the Water to his shock Pate and drew him up so
that we got him in again His ducking soberd him a little and he went
to sleep taking first out of his Pocket a Book which he desird I would
dry for him It provd to be my old favourite Author Bunyans Pilgrims
Progress in Dutch finely printed on good Paper with copper Cuts a
Dress better than I had ever seen it wear in its own Language I have
since found that it has been translated into most of the Languages of
Europe and suppose it has been more generally read than any other Book
except perhaps the Bible Honest John was the first that I know of who
mixd Narration and Dialogue a Method of Writing very engaging to the
Reader who in the most interesting Parts finds himself as it were
brought into the Company and present at the Discourse Defoe in his
Cruso his Moll Flanders Religious Courtship Family Instructor and
other Pieces has imitated it with Success And Richardson has done the
same in his Pamela etc

When we drew near the Island we found it was at a Place where there
could be no Landing there being a great Surff on the stony Beach So we
dropt Anchor and swung round towards the Shore Some People came down to
the Water Edge and hallowd to us as we did to them But the Wind was
so high and the Surff so loud that we could not hear so as to
understand each other There were Canoes on the Shore and we made Signs
and hallowd that they should fetch us but they either did not
understand us or thought it impracticable So they went away and Night
coming on we had no Remedy but to wait till the Wind should abate and
in the mean time the Boatman and I concluded to sleep if we could and
so crouded into the Scuttle with the Dutchman who was still wet and the
Spray beating over the Head of our Boat leakd thro to us so that we
were soon almost as wet as he In this Manner we lay all Night with very
little Rest But the Wind abating the next Day we made a Shift to reach
Amboy before Night having been  Hours on the Water without Victuals
or any Drink but a Bottle of filthy Rum The Water we saild on being
salt

In the Evening I found myself very feverish and went in to Bed But
having read somewhere that cold Water drank plentifully was good for a
Fever I followd the Prescription sweat plentifully most of the Night
my Fever left me and in the Morning crossing the Ferry I proceeded on
my Journey on foot having  Miles to Burlington where I was told I
should find Boats that would carry me the rest of the Way to
Philadelphia

It raind very hard all the Day I was thoroughly soakd and by Noon a
good deal tird so I stopt at a poor Inn where I staid all Night
beginning now to wish I had never left home I cut so miserable a Figure
too that I found by the Questions askd me I was suspected to be some
runaway Servant and in danger of being taken up on that Suspicion
However I proceeded the next Day and got in the Evening to an Inn
within  or  Miles of Burlington kept by one Dr Brown

He entered into Conversation with me while I took some Refreshment
and finding I had read a little became very sociable and friendly Our
Acquaintance continud as long as he livd He had been I imagine an
itinerant Doctor for there was no Town in England or Country in
Europe of which he could not give a very particular Account He had
some Letters and was ingenious but much of an Unbeliever and wickedly
undertook some Years after to travesty the Bible in doggrel Verse as
Cotton had done Virgil By this means he set many of the Facts in a very
ridiculous Light and might have hurt weak minds if his Work had been
publishdbut it never wasAt his House I lay that Night and the
next Morning reachd BurlingtonBut had the Mortification to find that
the regular Boats were gone a little before my coming and no other
expected to go till Tuesday this being Saturday Wherefore I returned
to an old Woman in the Town of whom I had bought Gingerbread to eat on
the Water and askd her Advice she invited me to lodge at her House
till a Passage by Water should offer and being tired with my foot
Travelling I accepted the Invitation She understanding I was a
Printer would have had me stay at that Town and follow my Business
being ignorant of the Stock necessary to begin with She was very
hospitable gave me a Dinner of Ox Cheek with great Goodwill accepting
only of a Pot of Ale in return And I thought myself fixd till Tuesday
should come However walking in the Evening by the Side of the River a
Boat came by which I found was going towards Philadelphia with several
People in her They took me in and as there was no wind we rowd all
the Way and about Midnight not having yet seen the City some of the
Company were confident we must have passd it and would row no farther
the others knew not where we were so we put towards the Shore got into
a Creek landed near an old Fence with the Rails of which we made a
Fire the Night being cold in October and there we remaind till
Daylight Then one of the Company knew the Place to be Coopers Creek a
little above Philadelphia which we saw as soon as we got out of the
Creek and arrivd there about  or  oClock on the Sunday morning
and landed at the Market street Wharff

I have been the more particular in this Description of my Journey and
shall be so of my first Entry into that City that you may in your Mind
compare such unlikely Beginnings with the Figure I have since made
there I was in my Working Dress my best Cloaths being to come round by
Sea I was dirty from my Journey my Pockets were stuffd out with
Shirts and Stockings I knew no Soul nor where to look for Lodging I
was fatigued with Travelling Rowing and Want of Rest I was very
hungry and my whole Stock of Cash consisted of a Dutch Dollar and about
a Shilling in Copper The latter I gave the People of the Boat for my
Passage who at first refusd it on Acct of my Rowing but I insisted
on their taking it a Man being sometimes more generous when he has but
a little Money than when he has plenty perhaps thro Fear of being
thought to have but little Then I walkd up the Street gazing about
till near the Market House I met a Boy with Bread I had made many a
Meal on Bread and inquiring where he got it I went immediately to the
Bakers he directed me to in Second Street and askd for Bisket
intending such as we had in Boston but they it seems were not made in
Philadelphia then I askd for a threepenny Loaf and was told they had
none such so not considering or knowing the Difference of Money and the
greater Cheapness nor the Names of his Bread I bade him give me
threepenny worth of any sort He gave me accordingly three great Puffy
Rolls I was surprizd at the Quantity but took it and having no room
in my Pockets walkd off with a Roll under each Arm and eating the
other Thus I went up Market Street as far as fourth Street passing by
the Door of Mr Read my future Wifes Father when she standing at the
Door saw me and thought I made as I certainly did a most awkward
ridiculous Appearance Then I turnd and went down Chestnut Street and
part of Walnut Street eating my Roll all the Way and coming round
found myself again at Market Street Wharff near the Boat I came in to
which I went for a Draught of the River Water and being filld with one
of my Rolls gave the other two to a Woman and her Child that came down
the River in the Boat with us and were waiting to go farther Thus
refreshd I walkd again up the Street which by this time had many
clean dressd People in it who were all walking the same Way I joind
them and thereby was led into the great Meeting House of the Quakers
near the Market I sat down among them and after looking round awhile
and hearing nothing said being very drowsy thro Labour and want of
Rest the preceding Night I fell fast asleep and continud so till the
Meeting broke up when one was kind enough to rouse me This was
therefore the first House I was in or slept in in Philadelphia

Walking again down towards the River and looking in the Faces of
People I met a young Quaker Man whose Countenance I likd and
accosting him requested he would tell me where a Stranger could get
Lodging We were then near the Sign of the Three Mariners Here says
he is one Place that entertains Strangers but it is not a reputable
House if thee wilt walk with me Ill show thee a better He brought me
to the Crooked Billet in Water Street Here I got a Dinner And while I
was eating it several sly Questions were askd me as it seemd to be
suspected from my youth and Appearance that I might be some Runaway
After Dinner my Sleepiness returnd and being shown to a Bed I lay
down without undressing and slept till Six in the Evening was calld
to Supper went to Bed again very early and slept soundly till next
Morning Then I made myself as tidy as I could and went to Andrew
Bradford the Printers I found in the Shop the old Man his Father whom
I had seen at New York and who travelling on horseback had got to
Philadelphia before me He introducd me to his Son who receivd me
civilly gave me a Breakfast but told me he did not at present want a
Hand being lately supplyd with one But there was another Printer in
town lately set up one Keimer who perhaps might employ me if not I
should be welcome to lodge at his House and he would give me a little
Work to do now and then till fuller Business should offer

The old Gentleman said he would go with me to the new Printer And when
we found him Neighbor says Bradford I have brought to see you a young
Man of your Business perhaps you may want such a One He askd me a few
Questions put a Composing Stick in my Hand to see how I workd and
then said he would employ me soon tho he had just then nothing for me
to do And taking old Bradford whom he had never seen before to be one
of the Towns People that had a Good Will for him enterd into a
Conversation on his present Undertaking and Prospects while Bradford
not discovering that he was the other Printers Father on Keimers
saying he expected soon to get the greatest Part of the Business into
his own Hands drew him on by artful Questions and starting little
Doubts to explain all his Views what Interest he relyd on and in
what manner he intended to proceedI who stood by and heard all saw
immediately that one of them was a crafty old Sophister and the other a
mere Novice Bradford left me with Keimer who was greatly surprizd
when I told him who the old Man was

Keimers Printing House I found consisted of an old shatterd Press
and one small wornout Fount of English which he was then using
himself composing in it an Elegy on Aquila Rose beforementioned an
ingenious young Man of excellent Character much respected in the Town
Clerk of the Assembly and a pretty Poet Keimer made Verses too but
very indifferently He could not be said to write them for his Manner
was to compose them in the Types directly out of his Head so there
being no Copy but one Pair of Cases and the Elegy likely to require
all the Letters no one could help himI endeavourd to put his
Press which he had not yet usd and of which he understood nothing
into Order fit to be workd with and promising to come and print off
his Elegy as soon as he should have got it ready I returnd to
Bradfords who gave me a little Job to do for the present and there I
lodged and dieted A few Days after Keimer sent for me to print off
the Elegy And now he had got another Pair of Cases and a Pamphlet to
reprint on which he set me to work

These two Printers I found poorly Qualified for their Business Bradford
had not been bred to it and was very illiterate and Keimer tho
something of a Scholar was a mere Compositor knowing nothing of
Presswork He had been one of the French Prophets and could act their
enthusiastic Agitations At this time he did not profess any particular
Religion but something of all on occasion was very ignorant of the
World and had as I afterward found a good deal of the Knave in his
Composition He did not like my Lodging at Bradfords while I workd
with him He had a House indeed but without Furniture so he could not
lodge me But he got me a Lodging at Mr Reads beforementioned who was
the Owner of his House And my Chest and Clothes being come by this
time I made rather a more respectable Appearance in the Eyes of Miss
Read than I had done when she first happend to see me eating my Roll in
the Street

I began now to have some Acquaintance among the young People of the
Town that were Lovers of Reading with whom I spent my Evenings very
pleasantly and gaining Money by my Industry and Frugality I lived very
agreably forgetting Boston as much as I could and not desiring that
any there should know where I resided except my Friend Collins who was
in my Secret and kept it when I wrote to him At length an Incident
happened that sent me back again much sooner than I had intended

I had a Brotherinlaw Robert Holmes Master of a Sloop that traded
between Boston and Delaware He being at New Castle  Miles below
Philadelphia heard there of me and wrote me a Letter mentioning the
Concern of my Friends in Boston at my abrupt Departure assuring me of
their Good will to me and that every thing would be accommodated to my
Mind if I would return to which he exhorted me very earnestly I wrote
an Answer to his Letter thankd him for his Advice but stated my
Reasons for quitting Boston fully and in such a Light as to convince
him I was not so wrong as he had apprehended Sir William Keith
Governor of the Province was then at New Castle and Capt Holmes
happening to be in Company with him when my Letter came to hand spoke
to him of me and showd him the Letter The Governor read it and
seemd surprizd when he was told my Age He said I appeard a young Man
of promising Parts and therefore should be encouraged The Printers at
Philadelphia were wretched ones and if I would set up there he made
no doubt I should succeed for his Part he would procure me the publick
Business and do me every other Service in his Power This my
Brotherinlaw afterwards told me in Boston But I knew as yet nothing
of it when one Day Keimer and I being at Work together near the Window
we saw the Governor and another Gentleman which provd to be Col
French of New Castle finely dressd come directly across the Street
to our House and heard them at the Door Keimer ran down immediately
thinking it a Visit to him But the Governor enquird for me came up
and with a Condescension and Politeness I had been quite unusd to made
me many Compliments desired to be acquainted with me blamd me kindly
for not having made myself known to him when I first came to the Place
and would have me away with him to the Tavern where he was going with
Col French to taste as he said some excellent Madeira I was not a
little surprizd and Keimer stard like a Pig poisond I went however
with the Governor and Col French to a Tavern at the Corner of Third
Street and over the Madeira he proposd my Setting up my Business laid
before me the Probabilities of Success and both he and Col French
assurd me I should have their Interest and Influence in procuring the
Publick Business of both Governments On my doubting whether my Father
would assist me in it Sir William said he would give me a Letter to
him in which he would state the Advantages and he did not doubt of
prevailing with him So it was concluded I should return to Boston in
the first Vessel with the Governors Letter recommending me to my
Father In the mean time the Intention was to be kept secret and I went
on working with Keimer as usual the Governor sending for me now and
then to dine with him a very great Honour I thought it and conversing
with me in the most affable familiar and friendly manner imaginable
About the End of April  a little Vessel offerd for Boston I took
leave of Keimer as going to see my Friends The Governor gave me an
ample Letter saying many flattering things of me to my Father and
strongly recommending the Project of my setting up at Philadelphia as a
Thing that must make my Fortune We struck on a Shoal in going down the
Bay and sprung a Leak we had a blustering time at Sea and were obligd
to pump almost continually at which I took my Turn We arrivd safe
however at Boston in about a FortnightI had been absent Seven Months
and my Friends had heard nothing of me for my Br Holmes was not yet
returnd and had not written about me My unexpected Appearance
surprizd the Family all were however very glad to see me and made me
Welcome except my Brother I went to see him at his PrintingHouse I
was better dressd than ever while in his Service having a genteel new
Suit from Head to foot a Watch and my Pockets lind with near Five
Pounds Sterling in Silver He receivd me not very frankly lookd me
all over and turnd to his Work again The JourneyMen were inquisitive
where I had been what sort of a Country it was and how I likd it I
praisd it much and the happy Life I led in it expressing strongly my
Intention of returning to it and one of them asking what kind of Money
we had there I producd a handful of Silver and spread it before them
which was a kind of Raree Show they had not been usd to Paper being
the Money of Boston Then I took an Opportunity of letting them see my
Watch and lastly my Brother still grum and sullen I gave them a
Piece of Eight to drink and took my LeaveThis Visit of mine offended
him extreamly For when my Mother some time after spoke to him of a
Reconciliation and of her Wishes to see us on good Terms together and
that we might live for the future as Brothers he said I had insulted
him in such a Manner before his People that he could never forget or
forgive it In this however he was mistaken

My Father received the Governors Letter with some apparent Surprize
but said little of it to me for some Days when Capt Holmes returning
he showd it to him askd if he knew Keith and what kind of a Man he
was Adding his Opinion that he must be of small Discretion to think of
setting a Boy up in Business who wanted yet  Years of being at Mans
Estate Holmes said what he could in favr of the Project but my Father
was clear in the Impropriety of it and at last gave a flat Denial to
it Then he wrote a civil Letter to Sir William thanking him for the
Patronage he had so kindly offered me but declining to assist me as yet
in Setting up I being in his Opinion too young to be trusted with the
Management of a Business so important and for which the Preparation
must be so expensive

My Friend and Companion Collins who was a Clerk at the PostOffice
pleasd with the Account I gave him of my new Country determind to go
thither also And while I waited for my Fathers Determination he set
out before me by Land to Rhodeisland leaving his Books which were a
pretty Collection of Mathematicks and Natural Philosophy to come with
mine and me to New York where he proposd to wait for me My Father
tho he did not approve Sir Williams Proposition was yet pleasd that I
had been able to obtain so advantageous a Character from a Person of
such Note where I had resided and that I had been so industrious and
careful as to equip myself so handsomely in so short a time therefore
seeing no Prospect of an Accommodation between my Brother and me he
gave his Consent to my Returning again to Philadelphia advisd me to
behave respectfully to the People there endeavour to obtain the general
Esteem and avoid lampooning and libelling to which he thought I had too
much Inclination telling me that by steady Industry and a prudent
Parsimony I might save enough by the time I was One and Twenty to set
me up and that if I came near the Matter he would help me out with the
rest This was all I could obtain except some small Gifts as Tokens of
his and my Mothers Love when I embarkd again for NewYork now with
their Approbation and their Blessing

The Sloop putting in at Newport Rhodeisland I visited my Brother John
who had been married and settled there some Years He received me very
affectionately for he always lovd me A Friend of his one Vernon
having some Money due to him in Pensilvania about  Pounds Currency
desired I would receive it for him and keep it till I had his
Directions what to remit it in Accordingly he gave me an OrderThis
afterwards occasiond me a good deal of Uneasiness At Newport we took
in a Number of Passengers for New York Among which were two young
Women Companions and a grave sensible Matronlike QuakerWoman with
her AttendantsI had shown an obliging readiness to do her some little
Services which impressd her I suppose with a degree of Goodwill
towards meTherefore when she saw a daily growing Familiarity between
me and the two Young Women which they appeard to encourage she took
me aside and said Young Man I am concernd for thee as thou has no
Friend with thee and seems not to know much of the World or of the
Snares Youth is exposd to depend upon it those are very bad Women I
can see it in all their Actions and if thee art not upon thy Guard
they will draw thee into some Danger they are Strangers to thee and I
advise thee in a friendly Concern for thy Welfare to have no
Acquaintance with them As I seemd at first not to think so ill of them
as she did she mentiond some Things she had observd and heard that
had escapd my Notice but now convincd me she was right I thankd her
for her kind Advice and promisd to follow itWhen we arrivd at New
York they told me where they livd and invited me to come and see
them but I avoided it And it was well I did For the next Day the
Captain missd a Silver Spoon and some other Things that had been taken
out of his Cabbin and knowing that these were a Couple of Strumpets he
got a Warrant to search their Lodgings found the stolen Goods and had
the Thieves punishd So tho we had escapd a sunken Rock which we
scrapd upon in the Passage I thought this Escape of rather more
Importance to me At New York I found my Friend Collins who had arrivd
there some Time before me We had been intimate from Children and had
read the same Books together But he had the Advantage of more time for
reading and Studying and a wonderful Genius for Mathematical Learning
in which he far outstript me While I livd in Boston most of my Hours
of Leisure for Conversation were spent with him and he continud a
sober as well as an industrious Lad was much respected for his Learning
by several of the Clergy and other Gentlemen and seemd to promise
making a good Figure in Life but during my Absence he had acquird a
Habit of Sotting with Brandy and I found by his own Account and what I
heard from others that he had been drunk every day since his Arrival
at New York and behavd very oddly He had gamd too and lost his
Money so that I was obligd to discharge his Lodgings and defray his
Expenses to and at Philadelphia Which provd extreamly inconvenient to
me The then Governor of New York Burnet Son of Bishop Burnet
hearing from the Captain that a young Man one of his Passengers had a
great many Books desired he would bring me to see him I waited upon
him accordingly and should have taken Collins with me but that he was
not sober The Govr treated me with great Civility showd me his
Library which was a very large one and we had a good deal of
Conversation about Books and Authors This was the second Governor who
had done me the Honour to take Notice of me which to a poor Boy like me
was very pleasingWe proceeded to Philadelphia I received on the Way
Vernons Money without which we could hardly have finishd our Journey
Collins wishd to be employd in some Counting House but whether they
discoverd his Dramming by his Breath or by his Behaviour tho he had
some Recommendations he met with no Success in any Application and
continud Lodging and Boarding at the same House with me and at my
Expense Knowing I had that Money of Vernons he was continually
borrowing of me still promising Repayment as soon as he should be in
Business At length he had got so much of it that I was distressd to
think what I should do in case of being calld on to remit it His
Drinking continud about which we sometimes quarreld for when a
little intoxicated he was very fractious Once in a Boat on the Delaware
with some other young Men he refused to row in his Turn I will be
rowd home says he We will not row you says I You must or stay all
Night on the Water says he just as you please The others said Let us
row what signifies it But my Mind being soured with his other Conduct
I continud to refuse So he swore he would make me row or throw me
overboard and coming along stepping on the Thwarts towards me when he
came up and struck at me I clapt my Hand under his Crutch and rising
pitchd him headforemost into the River I knew he was a good Swimmer
and so was under little Concern about him but before he could get
round to lay hold of the Boat we had with a few Strokes pulld her out
of his Reach And ever when he drew near the Boat we askd if he would
row striking a few Strokes to slide her away from himHe was ready to
die with Vexation and obstinately would not promise to row however
seeing him at last beginning to tire we lifted him in and brought him
home dripping wet in the Evening We hardly exchangd a civil Word
afterwards and a West India Captain who had a Commission to procure a
Tutor for the Sons of a Gentleman at Barbadoes happening to meet with
him agreed to carry him thither He left me then promising to remit me
the first Money he should receive in order to discharge the Debt But I
never heard of him after The Breaking into this Money of Vernons was
one of the first great Errata of my Life And this Affair showd that
my Father was not much out in his Judgment when he supposd me too Young
to manage Business of Importance But Sir William on reading his
Letter said he was too prudent There was great Difference in Persons
and Discretion did not always accompany Years nor was Youth always
without it And since he will not set you up says he I will do it
myself Give me an Inventory of the Things necessary to be had from
England and I will send for them You shall repay me when you are able
I am resolvd to have a good Printer here and I am sure you must
succeed This was spoken with such an Appearance of Cordiality that I
had not the least doubt of his meaning what he said I had hitherto kept
the Proposition of my Setting up a Secret in Philadelphia and I
still kept it Had it been known that I depended on the Governor
probably some Friend that knew him better would have advisd me not to
rely on him as I afterwards heard it as his known Character to be
liberal of Promises which he never meant to keepYet unsolicited as he
was by me how could I think his generous Offers insincere I believd
him one of the best Men in the World

I presented him an Inventory of a little Print House amounting by my
Computation to about  Sterling He likd it but askd me if my
being on the Spot in England to chuse the Types and see that every thing
was good of the kind might not be of some Advantage Then says he
when there you may make Acquaintances and establish Correspondencies in
the Bookselling and Stationary Way I agreed that this might be
advantageous Then says he get yourself ready to go with Annis which
was the annual Ship and the only one at that Time usually passing
between London and Philadelphia But it would be some Months before
Annis saild so I continud working with Keimer fretting about the
Money Collins had got from me and in daily Apprehensions of being
calld upon by Vernon which however did not happen for some Years
after

I believe I have omitted mentioning that in my first Voyage from Boston
being becalmd off Block Island our People set about catching Cod and
hauld up a great many Hitherto I had stuck to my Resolution of not
eating animal Food and on this Occasion I considerd with my Master
Tryon the taking every Fish as a kind of unprovoked Murder since none
of them had or ever could do us any Injury that might justify the
Slaughter All this seemd very reasonableBut I had formerly been a
great Lover of Fish and when this came hot out of the Frying Pan it
smelt admirably well I balancd some time between Principle and
Inclination till I recollected that when the Fish were opened I saw
smaller Fish taken out of their Stomachs Then thought I if you eat one
another I dont see why we maynt eat you So I dind upon Cod very
heartily and continud to eat with other People returning only now and
then occasionally to a vegetable Diet So convenient a thing it is to be
a reasonable Creature since it enables one to find or make a Reason
for every thing one has a mind to do

Keimer and I livd on a pretty good familiar Footing and agreed
tolerably well for he suspected nothing of my Setting up He retaind a
great deal of his old Enthusiasms and lovd Argumentation We therefore
had many Disputations I used to work him so with my Socratic Method
and had trepannd him so often by Questions apparently so distant from
any Point we had in hand and yet by degrees led to the Point and
brought him into Difficulties and Contradictions that at last he grew
ridiculously cautious and would hardly answer me the most common
Question without asking first What do you intend to infer from that
However it gave him so high an Opinion of my Abilities in the Confuting
Way that he seriously proposd my being his Colleague in a Project he
had of setting up a new Sect He was to preach the Doctrines and I was
to confound all Opponents When he came to explain with me upon the
Doctrines I found several Conundrums which I objected to unless I
might have my Way a little too and introduce some of mine Keimer wore
his Beard at full Length because somewhere in the Mosaic Law it is
said thou shalt not mar the Corners of thy beard He likewise kept
the seventh day Sabbath and these two Points were Essentials with him
I dislikd both but agreed to admit them upon Condition of his adopting
the Doctrine of using no animal Food I doubt says he my Constitution
will not bear that I assurd him it would and that he would be the
better for it He was usually a great Glutton and I promisd myself
some Diversion in halfstarving him He agreed to try the Practice if I
would keep him Company I did so and we held it for three Months We had
our Victuals dressd and brought to us regularly by a Woman in the
Neighbourhood who had from me a List of  Dishes to be prepard for us
at different times in all which there was neither Fish Flesh nor Fowl
and the whim suited me the better at this time from the Cheapness of it
not costing us above d Sterling each per Week I have since kept
several Lents most strictly leaving the common Diet for that and that
for the common abruptly without the least Inconvenience So that I
think there is little in the Advice of making those Changes by easy
Gradations I went on pleasantly but Poor Keimer sufferd grievously
tird of the Project longd for the Flesh Pots of Egypt and orderd a
roast Pig He invited me and two Women Friends to dine with him but it
being brought too soon upon the table he could not resist the
Temptation and ate it all up before we came

I had made some Courtship during this time to Miss Read I had a great
Respect and Affection for her and had some Reason to believe she had
the same for me but as I was about to take a long Voyage and we were
both very young only a little above  it was thought most prudent by
her Mother to prevent our going too far at present as a Marriage if it
was to take place would be more convenient after my Return when I
should be as I expected set up in my Business Perhaps too she thought
my Expectations not so well founded as I imagined them to be

My chief Acquaintances at this time were Charles Osborne Joseph
Watson and James Ralph all Lovers of Reading The two first were
Clerks to an eminent Scrivener or Conveyancer in the Town Charles
Brogden the other was Clerk to a Merchant Watson was a pious sensible
young Man of great IntegrityThe others rather more lax in their
Principles of Religion particularly Ralph who as well as Collins had
been unsettled by me for which they both made me sufferOsborne was
sensible candid frank sincere and affectionate to his Friends but in
literary Matters too fond of Criticising Ralph was ingenious genteel
in his Manners and extreamly eloquent I think I never knew a prettier
Talker Both of them great Admirers of Poetry and began to try their
Hands in little Pieces Many pleasant Walks we four had together on
Sundays into the Woods near Schuylkill where we read to one another and
conferrd on what we read Ralph was inclind to pursue the Study of
Poetry not doubting but he might become eminent in it and make his
Fortune by it alledging that the best Poets must when they first began
to write make as many Faults as he didOsborne dissuaded him assurd
him he had no Genius for Poetry and advisd him to think of nothing
beyond the Business he was bred to that in the mercantile way tho he
had no Stock he might by his Diligence and Punctuality recommend
himself to Employment as a Factor and in time acquire wherewith to
trade on his own Account I approvd the amusing ones self with Poetry
now and then so far as to improve ones Language but no farther On
this it was proposd that we should each of us at our next Meeting
produce a Piece of our own Composing in order to improve by our mutual
Observations Criticisms and Corrections As Language and Expression was
what we had in View we excluded all Considerations of Invention by
agreeing that the Task should be a Version of the th Psalm which
describes the Descent of a Deity When the Time of our Meeting drew
nigh Ralph calld on me first and let me know his Piece was ready I
told him I had been busy and having little Inclination had done
nothing He then showd me his Piece for my Opinion and I much approvd
it as it appeard to me to have great Merit Now says he Osborne
never will allow the least Merit in any thing of mine but makes 
Criticisms out of mere Envy He is not so jealous of you I wish
therefore you would take this Piece and produce it as yours I will
pretend not to have had time and so produce nothing We shall then see
what he will say to it It was agreed and I immediately transcribd it
that it might appear in my own hand We met Watsons Performance was
read there were some Beauties in it but many Defects Osbornes was
read It was much better Ralph did it Justice remarkd some Faults
but applauded the Beauties He himself had nothing to produce I was
backward seemd desirous of being excused had not had sufficient Time
to correct etc but no Excuse could be admitted produce I must It was
read and repeated Watson and Osborne gave up the Contest and joind in
applauding it immoderately Ralph only made some Criticisms and proposd
some Amendments but I defended my Text Osborne was against Ralph and
told him he was no better a Critic than Poet so he dropt the Argument
As they two went home together Osborne expressd himself still more
strongly in favour of what he thought my Production having restraind
himself before as he said lest I should think it Flattery But who
would have imagind says he that Franklin had been capable of such a
Performance such Painting such Force such Fire he has even improvd
the Original In his common Conversation he seems to have no Choice of
Words he hesitates and blunders and yet good God how he
writesWhen we next met Ralph discoverd the Trick we had plaid him
and Osborne was a little laught at This Transaction fixd Ralph in his
Resolution of becoming a Poet I did all I could to dissuade him from
it but he continued scribbling Verses till Pope curd him He became
however a pretty good Prose Writer More of him hereafter But as I may
not have occasion again to mention the other two I shall just remark
here that Watson died in my Arms a few Years after much lamented
being the best of our Set Osborne went to the West Indies where he
became an eminent Lawyer and made Money but died young He and I had
made a serious Agreement that the one who happend first to die should
if possible make a friendly Visit to the other and acquaint him how he
found things in that Separate State But he never fulfilld his Promise

The Governor seeming to like my Company had me frequently to his
House and his Setting me up was always mentiond as a fixd thing I
was to take with me Letters recommendatory to a Number of his Friends
besides the Letter of Credit to furnish me with the necessary Money for
purchasing the Press and Types Paper etc For these Letters I was
appointed to call at different times when they were to be ready but a
future time was still namedThus we went on till the Ship whose
Departure too had been several times postponed was on the Point of
sailing Then when I calld to take my Leave and receive the Letters
his Secretary Dr Bard came out to me and said the Governor was
extreamly busy in writing but would be down at Newcastle before the
Ship and there the Letters would be delivered to me

Ralph tho married and having one Child had determined to accompany me
in this Voyage It was thought he intended to establish a
Correspondence and obtain Goods to sell on Commission But I found
afterwards that thro some Discontent with his Wifes Relations he
purposed to leave her on their Hands and never return againHaving
taken leave of my Friends and interchangd some Promises with Miss
Read I left Philadelphia in the Ship which anchord at Newcastle The
Governor was there But when I went to his Lodging the Secretary came
to me from him with the civillest Message in the World that he could
not then see me being engagd in Business of the utmost Importance but
should send the Letters to me on board wishd me heartily a good Voyage
and a speedy Return etc I returnd on board a little puzzled but
still not doubting

Mr Andrew Hamilton a famous Lawyer of Philadelphia had taken Passage
in the same Ship for himself and Son and with Mr Denham a Quaker
Merchant and Messrs Onion and Russell Masters of an Iron Work in
Maryland had engagd the Great Cabin so that Ralph and I were forcd
to take up with a Birth in the Steerage And none on board knowing us
were considered as ordinary PersonsBut Mr Hamilton and his Son it
was James since Governor returnd from New Castle to Philadelphia the
Father being recalld by a great Fee to plead for a seized ShipAnd
just before we saild Col French coming on board and showing me great
Respect I was more taken Notice of and with my Friend Ralph invited by
the other Gentlemen to come into the Cabin there being now Room
Accordingly we removd thither

Understanding that Col French had brought on board the Governors
Dispatches I askd the Captain for those Letters that were to be under
my Care He said all were put into the Bag together and he could not
then come at them but before we landed in England I should have an
Opportunity of picking them out So I was satisfyd for the present and
we proceeded on our Voyage We had a sociable Company in the Cabin and
lived uncommonly well having the Addition of all Mr Hamiltons Stores
who had laid in plentifully In this Passage Mr Denham contracted a
Friendship for me that continued during his Life The Voyage was
otherwise not a pleasant one as we had a great deal of bad Weather

When we came into the Channel the Captain kept his Word with me and
gave me an Opportunity of examining the Bag for the Governors Letters
I found none upon which my Name was put as under my Care I pickd out
 or  that by the Hand writing I thought might be the promisd Letters
especially as one of them was directed to Basket the Kings printer and
another to some Stationer We arrivd in London the th of December
I waited upon the Stationer who came first in my Way delivering
the Letter as from Gov Keith I dont know such a Person says he but
opening the Letter O this is from Riddlesden I have lately found him
to be a compleat Rascal and I will have nothing to do with him nor
receive any Letters from him So putting the Letter into my Hand he
turnd on his Heel and left me to serve some Customer I was surprized
to find these were not the Governors Letters And after recollecting
and comparing Circumstances I began to doubt his SincerityI found my
Friend Denham and opened the whole Affair to him He let me into
Keiths Character told me there was not the least Probability that he
had written any Letters for me that no one who knew him had the
smallest Dependence on him and he laught at the Notion of the
Governors giving me a Letter of Credit having as he said no Credit to
giveOn my expressing some Concern about what I should do He advisd
me to endeavour getting some Employment in the Way of my Business Among
the Printers here says he you will improve yourself and when you
return to America you will set up to greater Advantage

We both of us happend to know as well as the Stationer that
Riddlesden the Attorney was a very Knave He had half ruind Miss
Reads Father by acquiring his note he bound for him By his Letter it
appeard there was a secret Scheme on foot to the Prejudice of
Hamilton supposd to be then coming over with us and that Keith was
concernd in it with Riddlesden Denham who was a Friend of Hamiltons
thought he ought to be acquainted with it So when he arrivd in
England which was soon after partly from Resentment and IllWill to
Keith and Riddlesden and partly from Good Will to him I waited on him
and gave him the Letter He thankd me cordially the Information being
of Importance to him And from that time he became my Friend greatly to
my Advantage afterwards on many Occasions

But what shall we think of a Governors playing such pitiful Tricks and
imposing so grossly on a poor ignorant Boy It was a Habit he had
acquired He wishd to please every body and having little to give he
gave Expectations He was otherwise an ingenious sensible Man a pretty
good Writer and a good Governor for the People tho not for his
Constituents the Proprietaries whose Instructions he sometimes
disregardedSeveral of our best Laws were of his Planning and passd
during his Administration

Ralph and I were inseparable Companions We took Lodgings together in
Little Britain at  per Week as much as we could then afford He
found some Relations but they were poor and unable to assist him He
now let me know his Intentions of remaining in London and that he never
meant to return to PhiladaHe had brought no Money with him the whole
he could muster having been expended in paying his Passage I had 
Pistoles So he borrowed occasionally of me to subsist while he was
looking out for BusinessHe first endeavoured to get into the
Playhouse believing himself qualifyd for an Actor but Wilkes to whom
he applyd advisd him candidly not to think of that Employment as it
was impossible he should succeed in itThen he proposd to Roberts a
Publisher in Paternoster Row to write for him a Weekly Paper like the
Spectator on certain Conditions which Roberts did not approve Then he
endeavourd to get Employmt as a Hackney Writer to copy for the
Stationers and Lawyers about the Temple but could find no Vacancy

I immediately got into Work at Palmers then a famous Printing House in
Bartholomew Close and here I continud near a Year I was pretty
diligent but spent with Ralph a good deal of my Earnings in going to
Plays and other Places of Amusement We had together consumd all my
Pistoles and now just rubbd on from hand to mouth He seemd quite to
forget his Wife and Child and I by degrees my Engagements wth Miss
Read to whom I never wrote more than one Letter and that was to let
her know I was not likely soon to return This was another of the great
Errata of my Life which I should wish to correct if I were to live it
over againIn fact by our Expences I was constantly kept unable to
pay my Passage

At Palmers I was employd in composing for the second Edition of
Woollastons sic Religion of Nature Some of his Reasonings not
appearing to me wellfounded I wrote a little metaphysical Piece in
which I made Remarks on them It was entitled A Dissertation on
Liberty and Necessity Pleasure and pain I inscribd it to my Friend
RalphI printed a small Number It occasiond my being more considerd
by Mr Palmer as a young Man of some Ingenuity tho he seriously
Expostulated with me upon the Principles of my Pamphlet which to him
appeard abominable My printing this Pamphlet was another Erratum

In our House there lodgd a young Woman a Millener who I think had a
Shop in the Cloisters She had been genteelly bred was sensible and
lively and of most pleasing Conversation Ralph read Plays to her in
the Evenings they grew intimate she took another Lodging and he
followd her They livd together some time but he being still out of
Business and her Income not sufficient to maintain them with her Child
he took a Resolution of going from London to try for a Country School
which bethought himself well qualifyd to undertake as he wrote an
excellent Hand and was a Master of Arithmetic and AccountsThis
however he deemd a Business below him and confident of future better
Fortune when he should be unwilling to have it known that he once was so
meanly employd he changd his Name and did me the Honour to assume
mineFor I soon after had a Letter from him acquainting me that he
was settled in a small Village in Berkshire I think it was where he
taught reading and writing to  or a dozen Boys at  pence each per
Week recommending Mrs T to my Care and desiring me to write to him
directing for Mr Franklin Schoolmaster at such a Place He continud to
write frequently sending me large Specimens of an Epic Poem which he
was then composing and desiring my Remarks and CorrectionsThese I
gave him from time to time but endeavourd rather to discourage his
Proceeding One of Youngs Satires was then just publishd I copyd and
sent him a great Part of it which set in a strong Light the Folly of
pursuing the Muses with any Hope of Advancement by them All was in
vain Sheets of the Poem continud to come by every Post In the mean
time Mrs T having on his Account lost her Friends and Business was
often in Distresses and usd to send for me and borrow what I could
spare to help her out of them I grew fond of her Company and being at
this time under no Religious Restraints and presuming on my Importance
to her I attempted Familiarities another Erratum which she repulsd
with a proper Resentment and acquainted him with my Behaviour This
made a Breach between us and when he returnd again to London he let
me know he thought I had cancelld all the Obligations he had been under
to meSo I found I was never to expect his Repaying me what I lent to
him or advancd for him This was however not then of much Consequence
as he was totally unable And in the Loss of his Friendship I found
myself relievd from a Burthen I now began to think of getting a little
Money beforehand and expecting better Work I left Palmers to work at
Wattss near Lincolns Inn Fields a still greater Printing House Here
I continud all the rest of my Stay in London

While I lodgd in Little Britain I made an Acquaintance with one Wilcox
a Bookseller whose Shop was at the next Door He had an immense
Collection of secondhand Books Circulating Libraries were not then in
Use but we agreed that on certain reasonable Terms which I have now
forgotten I might take read and return any of his Books This I
esteemd a great Advantage and I made as much use of it as I could

My Pamphlet by some means falling into the Hands of one Lyons a
Surgeon Author of a Book intitled The Infallibility of Human
Judgment it occasioned an Acquaintance between us he took great
Notice of me calld on me often to converse on those Subjects carried
me to the Horns a pale Alehouse in Lane Cheapside and introducd
me to Dr Mandeville Author of the Fable of the Bees who had a Club
there of which he was the Soul being a most facetious entertaining
Companion Lyons too introduced me to Dr Pemberton at Batsons Coffee
House who promisd to give me an Opportunity some time or other of
seeing Sir Isaac Newton of which I was extreamly desirous but this
never happened

I had brought over a few Curiosities among which the principal was a
Purse made of the Asbestos which purifies by Fire Sir Hans Sloane
heard of it came to see me and invited me to his House in Bloomsbury
Square where he showd me all his Curiosities and persuaded me to let
him add that to the Number for which he paid me handsomely

At my first Admission into this Printing House I took to working at
Press imagining I felt a Want of the Bodily Exercise I had been usd to
in America where Presswork is mixd with Composing I drank only Water
the other Workmen near  in Number were great Guzzlers of Beer On
occasion I carried up and down Stairs a large Form of Types in each
hand when others carried but one in both Hands They wonderd to see
from this and several Instances that the waterAmerican as they calld
me was stronger than themselves who drank strong beer We had an
Alehouse Boy who attended always in the House to supply the Workmen My
Companion at the Press drank every day a Pint before Breakfast a Pint
at Breakfast with his Bread and Cheese a Pint between Breakfast and
Dinner a Pint at Dinner a Pint in the Afternoon about Six oClock and
another when he had done his DaysWork I thought it a detestable
CustomBut it was necessary he supposd to drink strong Beer that
he might be strong to labour I endeavourd to convince him that the
Bodily Strength afforded by Beer could only be in proportion to the
Grain or Flour of the Barley dissolved in the Water of which it was
made that there was more Flour in a Pennyworth of Bread and therefore
if he would eat that with a Pint of Water it would give him more
Strength than a Quart of BeerHe drank on however and had  or 
Shillings to pay out of his Wages every Saturday Night for that muddling
Liquor an Expence I was free fromAnd thus these poor Devils keep
themselves always under

Watts after some Weeks desiring to have me in the ComposingRoom I left
the Pressmen A new Bienvenu or Sum for Drink being  was demanded
of me by the Compositors I thought it an Imposition as I had paid
below The Master thought so too and forbade my Paying it I stood
out two or three Weeks was accordingly considered as an Excommunicate
and had so many little Pieces of private Mischief done me by mixing my
Sorts transposing my Pages breaking my Matter etc etc and if I were
ever so little out of the Room and all ascribd to the Chapel Ghost
which they said ever haunted those not regularly admitted that
notwithstanding the Masters Protection I found myself obligd to
comply and pay the Money convincd of the Folly of being on ill Terms
with those one is to live with continually I was now on a fair Footing
with them and soon acquird considerable Influence I proposd some
reasonable Alterations in their ChapelC Laws and carried them against
all Opposition From my Example a great Part of them left their
muddling Breakfast of Beer and Bread and Cheese finding they could with
me be supplyd from a neighbouring House with a large Porringer of hot
Watergruel sprinkled with Pepper crumbd with Bread and a Bit of
Butter in it for the Price of a Pint of Beer viz three halfpence
This was a more comfortable as well as cheaper Breakfast and kept their
Heads clearerThose who continud sotting with Beer all day were
often by not paying out of Credit at the Alehouse and usd to make
Interest with me to get Beer their Light as they phrasd it being
out I watchd the Pay table on Saturday Night and collected what I
stood engagd for them having to pay some times near Thirty Shillings a
Week on their AccountsThis and my being esteemd a pretty good
Riggite that is a jocular verbal Satyrist supported my Consequence in
the SocietyMy constant Attendance I never making a St Monday
recommended me to the Master and my uncommon Quickness at Composing
occasiond my being put upon all Work of Dispatch which was generally
better paid So I went on now very agreably

  C A Printing House is always called a Chappel sic by the
  Workmen Franklins note

My Lodging in Little Britain being too remote I found another in
Dukestreet opposite to the Romish Chapel It was two pair of Stairs
backwards at an Italian Warehouse A Widow Lady kept the House she had
a Daughter and a Maid Servant and a Journeyman who attended the
Warehouse but lodgd abroad After sending to enquire my Character at
the House where I last lodgd she agreed to take me in at the same Rate
 per Week cheaper as she said from the Protection she expected in
having a Man lodge in the House She was a Widow an elderly Woman had
been bred a Protestant being a Clergymans Daughter but was converted
to the Catholic Religion by her Husband whose Memory she much
revered had lived much among People of Distinction and knew a 
Anecdotes of them as far back as the Times of Charles the Second She
was lame in her Knees with the Gout and therefore seldom stirrd out of
her Room so sometimes wanted Company and hers was so highly amusing
Franklin first wrote agreable both it and amusing are deleted in
the MS to me that I was sure to spend an Evening with her whenever
she desired it Our Supper was only half an Anchovy each on a very
little Strip of Bread and Butter and half a Pint of Ale between us But
the Entertainment was in her Conversation My always keeping good Hours
and giving little Trouble in the Family made her unwilling to part with
me so that when I talkd of a Lodging I had heard of nearer my
Business for  a Week which intent as I now was on saving Money
made some Difference she bid me not think of it for she would abate me
two Shillings a Week for the future so I remaind with her at  as
long as I staid in London

In a Garret of her House there lived a Maiden Lady of  in the most
retired Manner of whom my Landlady gave me this Account that she was a
Roman Catholic had been sent abroad when young and lodgd in a Nunnery
with an Intent of becoming a Nun but the Country not agreeing with her
she returnd to England where there being no Nunnery she had vowd to
lead the Life of a Nun as near as might be done in those Circumstances
Accordingly she had given all her Estate to charitable Uses reserving
only Twelve Pounds a Year to live on and out of this Sum she still gave
a great deal in Charity living herself on Watergruel only and using no
Fire but to boil itShe had lived many Years in that Garret being
permitted to remain there gratis by successive Catholic Tenants of the
House below as they deemd it a Blessing to have her there A Priest
visited her to confess her every Day I have askd her says my
Landlady how she as she livd could possibly find so much Employment
for a Confessor O says she it is impossible to avoid vain Thoughts
I was permitted once to visit her She was chearful and polite and
conversd pleasantly The Room was clean but had no other Furniture
than a Matras a Table with a Crucifix and Book a Stool which she gave
me to sit on and a Picture over the Chimney of St Veronica
displaying her Handkerchief with the miraculous Figure of Christs
bleeding Face on it which she explaind to me with great Seriousness
She lookd pale but was never sick and I give it as another Instance
on how small an Income Life and Health may be supported

At Wattss Printinghouse I contracted an Acquaintance with an ingenious
young Man one Wygate who having wealthy Relations had been better
educated than most Printers was a tolerable Latinist spoke French and
lovd Reading I taught him and a Friend of his to swim at twice going
into the River and they soon became good Swimmers They introducd me
to some Gentlemen from the Country who went to Chelsea by Water to see
the College and Don Salteros Curiosities In our Return at the
Request of the Company whose Curiosity Wygate had excited I stript and
leapt into the River and swam from near Chelsea to Blackfryars
performing on the Way many Feats of Activity both upon and under Water
that surprizd and pleasd those to whom they were NoveltiesI had
from a Child been ever delighted with this Exercise had studied and
practisd all Thevenots Motions and Positions added some of my own
aiming at the graceful and easy as well as the Useful All these I took
this Occasion of exhibiting to the Company and was much flatterd by
their AdmirationAnd Wygate who was desirous of becoming a Master
grew more and more attachd to me on that account as well as from the
Similarity of our Studies He at length proposd to me travelling all
over Europe together supporting ourselves everywhere by working at our
Business I was once inclind to it But mentioning it to my good Friend
Mr Denham with whom I often spent an Hour when I had Leisure He
dissuaded me from it advising me to think only of returning to
Pensilvania which he was now about to do

I must record one Trait of this good Mans Character He had formerly
been in Business at Bristol but faild in Debt to a Number of People
compounded and went to America There by a close Application to
Business as a Merchant he acquird a plentiful Fortune in a few Years
Returning to England in the Ship with me He invited his old Creditors
to an Entertainment at which he thankd them for the easy Composition
they had favourd him with and when they expected nothing but the
Treat every Man at the first Remove found under his Plate an Order on
a Banker for the full Amount of the unpaid Remainder with Interest

He now told me he was about to return to Philadelphia and should carry
over a great Quantity of Goods in order to open a Store there He
proposd to take me over as his Clerk to keep his Books in which he
would instruct me copy his Letters and attend the Store He added
that as soon as I should be acquainted with mercantile Business he would
promote me by sending me with a Cargo of Flour and Bread etc to the West
Indies and procure me Commissions from others which would be
profitable and if I managd well would establish me handsomely The
Thing pleasd me for I was grown tired of London rememberd with
Pleasure the happy Months I had spent in Pennsylvania and wishd again
to see it Therefore I immediately agreed on the Terms of Fifty Pounds
a Year Pensylvania Money less indeed than my then present Gettings as a
Compositor but affording a better Prospect

I now took leave of Printing as I thought for ever and was daily
employd in my new Business going about with Mr Denham among the
Tradesmen to purchase various Articles and seeing them packd up
doing Errands calling upon Workmen to dispatch etc and when all was
on board I had a few Days Leisure On one of these Days I was to my
Surprise sent for by a great Man I knew only by Name a Sir William
Wyndham and I waited upon him He had heard by some means or other of my
Swimming from Chelsey to Blackfryars and of my teaching Wygate and
another young Man to swim in a few Hours He had two Sons about to set
out on their Travels he wishd to have them first taught Swimming and
proposd to gratify me handsomely if I would teach themThey were not
yet come to Town and my Stay was uncertain so I could not undertake it
But from this Incident I thought it likely that if I were to remain in
England and open a Swimming School I might get a good deal of Money
And it struck me so strongly that had the Overture been sooner made me
probably I should not so soon have returned to AmericaAfter many
Years you and I had something of more Importance to do with one of
these Sons of Sir William Wyndham become Earl of Egremont which I
shall mention in its PlaceThis promise Franklin did not fulfill

Thus I spent about  Months in London Most Part of the Time I workd
hard at my Business and spent but little upon myself except in seeing
Plays and in BooksMy Friend Ralph had kept me poor He owed me about
 Pounds which I was now never likely to receive a great Sum out of
my small Earnings I lovd him notwithstanding for he had many amiable
QualitiesTho I had by no means improvd my Fortune But I had pickd
up some very ingenious Acquaintance whose Conversation was of great
Advantage to me and I had read considerably

We saild from Gravesend on the d of July  For the Incidents of
the Voyage I refer you to my Journal where you will find them all
minutely related Perhaps the most important Part of that Journal is the
Plan This Plan is not found in the Journal printed in Writings
II  to be found in it which I formed at Sea for regulating my
future Conduct in Life It is the more remarkable as being formed when
I was so young and yet being pretty faithfully adhered to quite thro
to old AgeWe landed in Philadelphia on the th of October where I
found sundry Alterations Keith was no longer Governor being superceded
by Major Gordon I met him walking the Streets as a common Citizen He
seemd a little ashamd at seeing me but passd without saying any
thing I should have been as much ashamd at seeing Miss Read had not
her Frds despairing with Reason of my Return after the Receipt of my
Letter persuaded her to marry another one Rogers a Potter which was
done in my Absence With him however she was never happy and soon
parted from him refusing to cohabit with him or bear his Name it
being now said that he had another Wife He was a worthless Fellow tho
an excellent Workman which was the Temptation to her Friends He got
into Debt ran away in  or  and went to the West Indies and died
there Keimer had got a better House a Shop well supplyd with
Stationary plenty of new Types a number of Hands tho none good and
seemd to have a great deal of Business

Mr Denham took a Store in Water Street where we opend our Goods I
attended the Business diligently studied Accounts and grew in a little
Time expert at selling We lodgd and boarded together he counselld me
as a Father having a sincere Regard for me I respected and lovd him
and we might have gone on together very happily But in the Beginning of
Feby  when I had just passd my st Year we both were taken
ill My Distemper was a Pleurisy which very nearly carried me offI
suffered a good deal gave up the Point in my own mind and was rather
disappointed when I found my Self recovering regretting in some degree
that I must now some time or other have all that disagreeable Work to do
over againI forget what his Distemper was It held him a long time
and at length carried him off He left me a small Legacy in a
nuncupative Will as a Token of his Kindness for me and he left me once
more to the wide World For the Store was taken into the Care of his
Executors and my Employment under him endedMy Brotherinlaw Holmes
being now at Philadelphia advised my Return to my Business And Keimer
tempted me with an Offer of large Wages by the Year to come and take the
Management of his PrintingHouse that he might better attend his
Stationers ShopI had heard a bad Character of him in London from
his Wife and her Friends and was not fond of having any more to do with
him I tryd for farther Employment as a Merchants Clerk but not
readily meeting with any I closd again with Keimer

I found in his House these Hands Hugh Meredith a WelshPensilvanian
 Years of Age bred to Country Work honest sensible had a great
deal of solid Observation was something of a Reader but given to
drink Stephen Potts a young Country Man of full Age bred to the
Sameof uncommon natural Parts and great Wit and Humour but a little
idle These he had agreed with at extream low Wages per Week to be
raisd a Shilling every  Months as they would deserve by improving in
their Business and the Expectation of these high Wages to come on
hereafter was what he had drawn them in with Meredith was to work at
Press Potts at Bookbinding which he by Agreement was to teach them
tho he knew neither one nor tother John  a wild Irishman brought
up to no Business whose Service for  Years Keimer had purchasd from
the Captain of a Ship He too was to be made a Pressman George Webb an
Oxford Scholar whose Time for  Years he had likewise bought intending
him for a Compositor of whom more presently And David Harry a Country
Boy whom he had taken Apprentice I soon perceivd that the Intention
of engaging me at Wages so much higher than he had been usd to give
was to have these raw cheap Hands formd thro me and as soon as I had
instructed them then they being all articled to him he should be able
to do without meI went on however very chearfully put his Printing
House in Order which had been in great Confusion and brought his Hands
by degrees to mind their Business and to do it better

It was an odd Thing to find an Oxford Scholar in the Situation of a
bought Servant He was not more than  Years of Age and gave me this
Account of himself that he was born in Gloucester educated at a
Grammar School there had been distinguishd among the Scholars for some
apparent Superiority in performing his Part when they exhibited Plays
belongd to the Witty Club there and had written some Pieces in Prose
and Verse which were printed in the Gloucester NewspapersThence he
was sent to Oxford where he continud about a Year but not
wellsatisfyd wishing of all things to see London and become a Player
At length receiving his Quarterly Allowance of  Guineas instead of
discharging his Debts he walkd out of Town hid his Gown in a Furz
Bush and footed it to London where having no Friend to advise him he
fell into bad Company soon spent his Guineas found no means of being
introducd among the Players grew necessitous pawnd his Cloaths and
wanted Bread Walking the Street very hungry and not knowing what to do
with himself a Crimps Bill was put into his Hand offering immediate
Entertainment and Encouragement to such as would bind themselves to
serve in America He went directly signd the Indentures was put into
the Ship and came over never writing a Line to acquaint his Friends
what was become of him He was lively witty goodnaturd and a
pleasant Companion but idle thoughtless and imprudent to the last
Degree

John the Irishman soon ran away With the rest I began to live very
agreably for they all respected me the more as they found Keimer
incapable of instructing them and that from me they learnt something
daily We never workd on a Saturday that being Keimers Sabbath So I
had two Days for ReadingMy Acquaintance with ingenious People in the
Town increased Keimer himself treated me with great Civility and
apparent Regard and nothing now made me uneasy but my Debt to Vernon
which I was yet unable to pay being hitherto but a poor Oeconomist He
however kindly made no Demand of it

Our PrintingHouse often wanted Sorts and there was no Letter Founder
in America I had seen Types cast at Jamess in London but without much
Attention to the Manner However I now contrivd a Mould made use of
the Letters we had as Puncheons struck the Matrices in Lead and thus
supplyd in a pretty tolerable way all Deficiencies I also engravd
several Things on occasion I made the Ink I was Warehouseman and
every thing in short quite a Factotum

But however serviceable I might be I found that my Services became
every Day of less Importance as the other Hands improvd in the
Business And when Keimer paid my second Quarters Wages he let me know
that he felt them too heavy and thought I should make an Abatement He
grew by degrees less civil put on more of the Master frequently found
Fault was captious and seemd ready for an Outbreaking I went on
nevertheless with a good deal of Patience thinking that his incumberd
Circumstances were partly the Cause At length a Trifle snapt our
Connexion For a great Noise happening near the Courthouse I put my
Head out of the Window to see what was the Matter Keimer being in the
Street lookd up and saw me calld out to me in a loud voice and angry
Tone to mind my Business adding some reproachful Words that nettled me
the more for their Publicity all the Neighbours who were looking out on
the same Occasion being Witnesses how I was treated He came up
immediately into the PrintingHouse continud the Quarrel high Words
passd on both Sides he gave me the Quarters Warning we had
stipulated expressing a Wish that he had not been obligd to so long a
Warning I told him his Wish was unnecessary for I would leave him that
Instant and so taking my Hat walkd out of Doors desiring Meredith
whom I saw below to take care of some Things I left and bring them to
my Lodging

Meredith came accordingly in the Evening when we talkd my Affair over
He had conceivd a great Regard for me and was very unwilling that I
should leave the House while he remaind in it He dissuaded me from
returning to my native Country which I began to think of He reminded me
that Keimer was in debt for all he possessd that his Creditors began
to be uneasy that he kept his Shop miserably sold often without Profit
for ready Money and often trusted without keeping Accounts That he
must therefore fail which would make a Vacancy I might profit ofI
objected my Want of Money He then let me know that his Father had a
high Opinion of me and from some Discourse that had passd between
them he was sure would advance Money to set us up if I would enter
into Partner Ship with him My Time says he will be out with Keimer in
the Spring By that time we may have our Press and Types in from London
I am sensible I am no Workman If you like it Your Skill in the
Business shall be set against the Stock I furnish and we will share the
Profits equallyThe Proposal was agreable and I consented His Father
was in Town and approvd of it the more as he saw I had great
Influence with his Son had prevaild on him to abstain long from
Dramdrinking and he hopd might break him of that wretched Habit
entirely when we came to be so closely connected I gave an Inventory
to the Father who carryd it to a Merchant the Things were sent for
the Secret was to be kept till they should arrive and in the mean time
I was to get work if I could at the other Printing House But I found no
Vacancy there and so remaind idle a few Days when Keimer on a
Prospect of being employd to print some PaperMoney in New Jersey
which would require Cuts and various Types that I only could supply and
apprehending Bradford might engage me and get the Jobb from him sent me
a very civil Message that old Friends should not part for a few Words
the Effect of sudden Passion and wishing me to return Meredith
persuaded me to comply as it would give more Opportunity for his
Improvement under my daily InstructionsSo I returnd and we went on
more smoothly than for some time before The New Jersey Jobb was
obtained I contrivd a CopperPlate Press for it the first that had
been seen in the Country I cut several Ornaments and Checks for the
Bills We went together to Burlington where I executed the Whole to
Satisfaction and he received so large a Sum for the Work as to be
enabled thereby to keep his Head much longer above Water

At Burlington I made an Acquaintance with many principal People of the
Province Several of them had been appointed by the Assembly a Committee
to attend the Press and take Care that no more Bills were printed than
the Law directed They were therefore by Turns constantly with us and
generally he who attended brought with him a Friend or two for Company
My Mind having been much more improvd by Reading than Keimers I
suppose it was for that Reason my Conversation seemd to be more valud
They had me to their Houses introducd me to their Friends and showd
me much Civility while he tho the Master was a little neglected In
truth he was an odd Fish ignorant of common Life fond of rudely
opposing receivd Opinions slovenly to extream dirtiness enthusiastic
in some Points of Religion and a little Knavish withal We continud
there near  Months and by that time I could reckon among my acquired
Friends Judge Allen Samuel Bustill the Secretary of the Province
Isaac Pearson Joseph Cooper and several of the Smiths Members of
Assembly and Isaac Decow the Surveyor General The latter was a shrewd
sagacious old Man who told me that he began for himself when young by
wheeling Clay for the Brickmakers learnt to write after he was of Age
carryd the Chain for Surveyors who taught him Surveying and he had
now by his Industry acquird a good Estate and says he I foresee that
you will soon work this Man out of his Business and make a Fortune in it
at Philadelphia He had not then the least Intimation of my Intention to
set up there or any where These Friends were afterwards of great use to
me as I occasionally was to some of them They all continued their
Regard for me as long as they lived

Before I enter upon my public Appearance in Business it may be well to
let you know the then State of my Mind with regard to my Principles and
Morals that you may see how far those influencd the future Events of
my Life My Parents sic had early given me religious Impressions
and brought me through my Childhood piously in the Dissenting Way But I
was scarce  when after doubting by turns of several Points as I found
them disputed in the different Books I read I began to doubt of
Revelation it self Some Books against Deism fell into my Hands they
were said to be the Substance of Sermons preached at Boyles Lectures
It happened that they wrought an Effect on me quite contrary to what was
intended by them For the Arguments of the Deists which were quoted to
be refuted appeared to me much Stronger than the Refutations In short
I soon became a thorough Deist My Arguments perverted some others
particularly Collins and Ralph but each of them having afterwards
wrongd me greatly without the least Compunction and recollecting
Keiths Conduct towards me who was another Freethinker and my own
towards Vernon and Miss Read which at Times gave me great Trouble I
began to suspect that this Doctrine tho it might be true was not very
usefulMy London Pamphlet which had for its Motto these Lines of
Dryden

    Whatever is is right Tho purblind Man
    Sees but a Part of the Chain the nearest Link
    His Eyes not carrying to the equal Beam
    That poises all above

And from the Attributes of God his infinite Wisdom Goodness and Power
concluded that nothing could possibly be wrong in the World and that
Vice and Virtue were empty Distinctions no such Things existing
appeard now not so clever a Performance as I once thought it and I
doubted whether some Error had not insinuated itself unperceivd into
my Argument so as to infect all that followd as is common in
metaphysical ReasoningsI grew convincd that Truth Sincerity and
Integrity in Dealings between Man and Man were of the utmost
Importance to the Felicity of Life and I formd written Resolutions
wch still remain in my Journal Book to practice them everwhile I
lived Revelation had indeed no weight with me as such but I
entertaind an Opinion that tho certain Actions might not be bad
because they were forbidden by it or good because it commanded
them yet probably those Actions might be forbidden because they were
bad for us or commanded because they were beneficial to us in their
own Natures all the Circumstances of things considered And this
Persuasion with the kind hand of Providence or some guardian Angel or
accidental favourable Circumstances and Situations or all together
preserved me thro this dangerous Time of Youth and the hazardous
Situations I was sometimes in among Strangers remote from the Eye and
Advice of my Father without any wilful gross Immorality or Injustice
that might have been expected from my Want of Religion I say wilful
because the Instances I have mentioned had something of Necessity in
them from my Youth Inexperience and the Knavery of others I had
therefore a tolerable Character to begin the World with I valued it
properly and determind to preserve it

We had not been long returnd to Philadelphia before the New Types
arrivd from London We settled with Keimer and left him by his Consent
before he heard of itWe found a House to hire near the Market and
took it To lessen the Rent which was then but  a Year tho I have
since known it let for  We took in Tho Godfrey a Glazier and his
Family who were to pay a considerable Part of it to us and we to board
with them We had scarce opened our Letters and put our Press in Order
before George House an Acquaintance of mine brought a Countryman to
us whom he had met in the Street enquiring for a Printer All our Cash
was now expended in the Variety of Particulars we had been obliged to
procure and this Countrymans Five Shillings being our first Fruits and
coming so seasonably gave me more Pleasure than any Crown I have since
earned and from the Gratitude I felt towards House has made me often
more ready than perhaps I should otherwise have been to assist young
Beginners

There are Croakers in every Country always boding its Ruin Such a one
then lived in Philadelphia a Person of Note an elderly Man with a
wise Look and very grave Manner of speaking His Name was Samuel
Mickle This Gentleman a Stranger to me stopt one Day at my Door and
asked me if I was the young Man who had lately opened a new Printing
House Being answered in the Affirmative he said he was sorry for me
because it was an expensive Undertaking and the Expence would be lost
for Philadelphia was a sinking Place the People already half Bankrupts
or near being so all Appearances to the contrary such as hew Buildings
and the Rise of Rents being to his certain Knowledge fallacious for
they were in fact among the Things that would soon ruin usAnd he gave
me such a Detail of Misfortunes now existing or that were soon to
exist that he left me half melancholy Had I known him before I engaged
in this Business probably I never should have done itThis Man
continued to live in this decaying Place and to declaim in the same
Strain refusing for many Years to buy a House there because all was
going to Destruction and at last I had the Pleasure of seeing him give
five times as much for one as he might have bought it for when he first
began his Croaking

I should have mentioned before that in the Autumn of the proceeding
Year I had formed most of my ingenious Acquaintance into a Club of
mutual Improvement which we called the Junto We met on Friday
Evenings The Rules I drew up required that every Member in his Turn
should produce one or more Queries on any Point of Morals Politics or
Natural Philosophy to be discussed by the Company and once in three
Months produce and read an Essay of his own Writing on any Subject he
pleased Our Debates were to be under the Direction of a President and
to be conducted in the sincere Spirit of Enquiry after Truth without
Fondness for Dispute or Desire of Victory and to prevent Warmth all
Expressions of Positiveness in Opinions or direct Contradiction were
after some time made contraband and prohibited under small pecuniary
PenaltiesThe first Members were Joseph Breintnal a Copyer of
Deeds for the Scriveners a goodnaturd friendly middleagd Man a
great Lover of Poetry reading all he could meet with and writing some
that was tolerable very ingenious in many little Nicknackeries and of
sensible Conversation Thomas Godfrey a selftaught Mathematician
great in his Way and afterwards Inventor of what is now calld Hadleys
Quadrant But he knew little out of his way and was not a pleasing
Companion as like most Great Mathematicians I have met with he
expected universal Precision in every thing said or was forever denying
or distinguishing upon Trifles to the Disturbance of all Conversation
He soon left us Nicholas Scull a Surveyor afterwards
SurveyorGeneral who lovd Books and sometimes made a few Verses
William Parsons bred a Shoemaker but loving Reading had acquird a
considerable Share of Mathematics which he first studied with a View to
Astrology that he afterwards laught at He also became Surveyor General
William Maugridge a Joiner a most exquisite Mechanic and a solid
sensible Man Hugh Meredith Stephen Potts and George Webb I have
Characterisd before Robert Grace a young Gentleman of some Fortune
generous lively and witty a Lover of Punning and of his Friends And
William Coleman then a Merchants Clerk about my Age who had the
coolest clearest Head the best Heart and the exactest Morals of
almost any Man I ever met with He became afterwards a Merchant of great
Note and one of our Provincial Judges Our Friendship continued without
Interruption to his death upwards of  Years And the club continud
almost as long and was the best School of Philosophy and Politics
that then existed in the Province for our Queries which were read the
Week preceding their Discussion put us on reading with Attention upon
the several Subjects that we might speak more to the purpose and here
too we acquired better Habits of Conversation every thing being studied
in our Rules which might prevent our disgusting each other From hence
the long Continuance of the Club which I shall have frequent Occasion
to speak farther of hereafter But my giving this Account of it here is
to show something of the Interest I had every one of these exerting
themselves in recommending Business to usBrientnal particularly
procurd us from the Quakers the Printing  Sheets of their History
William Sewels the rest being to be done by Keimer and upon this we
workd exceeding hard for the Price was low It was a Folio Pro Patria
Size in Pica with Long Primer Notes I composd of it a Sheet a Day
and Meredith workd it off at Press It was often  at Night and
sometimes later before I had finishd my Distribution for the next days
Work For the little Jobbs sent in by our other Friends now and then put
us back But so determind I was to continue doing a Sheet a Day of the
Folio that one Night when having imposd my Forms I thought my Days
Work over one of them by accident was broken and two Pages reducd to
pie I immediately distributed and composd it over again before I went
to bed And this Industry visible to our Neighbours began to give us
Character and Credit particularly I was told that mention being made
of the new Printing Office at the Merchants everynight Club the
general Opinion was that it must fail there being already two Printers
in the Place Keimer and Bradford but Dr Baird whom you and I saw
many Years after at his native Place St Andrews in Scotland gave a
contrary Opinion for the Industry of that Franklin says he is
superior to any thing I ever saw of the kind I see him still at work
when I go home from Club and he is at Work again before his Neighbours
are out of bed This struck the rest and we soon after had Offers from
one of them to Supply us with Stationary But as yet we did not chuse to
engage in Shop Business

I mention this Industry the more particularly and the more freely tho
it seems to be talking in my own Praise that those of my Posterity who
shall read it may know the Use of that Virtue when they see its
Effects in my Favour throughout this Relation

George Webb who had found a Friend that lent him wherewith to purchase
his Time of Keimer now came to offer himself as a Journeyman to us We
could not then imploy him but I foolishly let him know as a Secret
that I soon intended to begin a Newspaper and might then have Work for
him My Hopes of Success as I told him were founded on this that the
then only Newspaper the American Weekly Mercury printed by Bradford
was a paltry thing wretchedly managd no way entertaining and yet was
profitable to himI therefore thought a good Paper could scarcely fail
of good Encouragemt I requested Webb not to mention it but he told it
to Keimer who immediately to be beforehand with me published
Proposals for Printing one himself on which Webb was to be employdI
resented this and to counteract them as I could not yet begin our
Paper I wrote several Pieces of Entertainment for Bradfords Paper
under the Title of the Busy Body which Brientnal continud some Months
By this means the Attention of the Publick was fixd on that Paper and
Keimers Proposals which we burlesqud and ridiculd were disregarded
He began his Paper however and after carrying it on three Quarters
of a Year with at most only  Subscribers he offerd it to me for a
Trifle and I having been ready some time to go on with it took it in
hand directly and it provd in a few years extreamly profitable to me

I perceive that I am apt to speak in the singular Number though our
Partnership still continud The Reason may be that in fact the whole
Management of the Business lay upon me Meredith was no Compositor a
poor Pressman and seldom sober My Friends lamented my Connection with
him but I was to make the best of it

Our first Papers made a quite different Appearance from any before in
the Province a better Type and better printed In MS is found Insert
these Remarks in a Note but some spirited Remarks of my Writing on
the Dispute then going on between Govr Burnet and the Massachusetts
Assembly struck the principal People occasiond the Paper and the
Manager of it to be much talkd of and in a few Weeks brought them all
to be our Subscribers Their Example was followd by many and our
Number went on growing continuallyThis was one of the first good
Effects of my having learnt a little to scribble Another was that the
leading Men seeing a News Paper now in the hands of one who could also
handle a Pen thought it convenient to oblige and encourage me Bradford
still printed the Votes and Laws and other Publick Business He had
printed an Address of the House to the Governor in a coarse blundering
manner We reprinted it elegantly and correctly and sent one to every
Member They were sensible of the Difference it strengthend the Hands
of our Friends in the House and they voted us their Printers for the
Year ensuing

Among my Friends in the House I must not forget Mr Hamilton before
mentioned who was then returned from England and had a Seat in it He
interested himself for me strongly in that Instance as he did in many
others afterwards continuing his Patronage till his DeathD Mr
Vernon about this time put me in mind of the Debt I owd him but did
not press me I wrote him an ingenuous Letter of Acknowledgments cravd
his Forbearance a little longer which he allowd me and as soon as I
was able I paid the Principal with Interest and many ThanksSo that
Erratum was in some degree corrected

  D I got his Son once   Franklins note

But now another Difficulty came upon me which I had never the least
Reason to expect Mr Merediths Father who was to have paid for our
Printing House according to the Expectations given me was able to
advance only one Hundred Pounds Currency which had been paid and a
Hundred more was due to the Merchant who grew impatient and sud us
all We gave Bail but saw that if the Money could not be raisd in
time the Suit must come to a Judgment and Execution and our hopeful
Prospects must with us be ruined as the Press and Letters must be sold
for Payment perhaps at half PriceIn this Distress two true Friends
whose Kindness I have never forgotten nor ever shall forget while I can
remember any thing came to me separately unknown to each other and
without any Application from me offering each of them to advance me all
the Money that should be necessary to enable me to take the whole
Business upon myself if that should be practicable but they did not
like my continuing the Partnership with Meredith who as they said was
often seen drunk in the Streets and playing at low Games in Alehouses
much to our Discredit These two Friends were William Coleman and
Robert Grace I told them I could not propose a Separation while any
Prospect remaind of the Merediths fulfilling their Part of our
Agreement Because I thought myself under great Obligations to them for
what they had done and would do if they could But if they finally
faild in their Performance and our Partnership must be dissolvd I
should then think myself at Liberty to accept the Assistance of my
Friends Thus the matter rested for some time When I said to my
Partner perhaps your Father is dissatisfied at the Part you have
undertaken in this Affair of ours and is unwilling to advance for you
and me what he would for you alone If that is the Case tell me and I
will resign the whole to you and go about my Business No says he my
Father has really been disappointed and is really unable and I am
unwilling to distress him farther I see this is a Business I am not fit
for I was bred a Farmer and it was a Folly in me to come to Town and
put my Self at  Years of Age an Apprentice to learn a new Trade Many
of our Welsh People are going to settle in North Carolina where Land is
cheap I am inclind to go with them and following my old Employment
You may find Friends to assist you If you will take the Debts of the
Company upon you return to my Father the hundred Pound he has advancd
pay my little personal Debts and give me Thirty Pounds and a new
Saddle I will relinquish the Partnership and leave the whole in your
Hands I agreed to this Proposal It was drawn up in Writing signd and
seald immediately I gave him what he demanded and he went soon after
to Carolina from whence he sent me next Year two long Letters
containing the best Account that had been given of that Country the
Climate Soil Husbandry etc for in those Matters he was very
judicious I printed them in the Papers and they gave grate
Satisfaction to the Publick

As soon as he was gone I recurrd to my two Friends and because I
would not give an unkind Preference to either I took half what each had
offered and I wanted of one and half of the other paid off the
Company Debts and went on with the Business in my own Name advertising
that the Partnership was dissolved I think this was in or about the
Year  July  

About this Time there was a Cry among the People for more PaperMoney
only  being extant in the Province and that soon to be sunk The
wealthy Inhabitants opposd any Addition being against all Paper
Currency from an Apprehension that it would depreciate as it had done
in New England to the Prejudice of all CreditorsWe had discussd this
Point in our Junto where I was on the Side of an Addition being
persuaded that the first small Sum struck in  had done much good by
increasing the Trade Employment and Number of Inhabitants in the
Province since I now saw all the old Houses inhabited and many new
ones building where as I rememberd well that when I first walkd
about the Streets of Philadelphia eating my Roll I saw most of the
Houses in Walnut Street between Second and Front Streets with Bills on
their Doors to be let and many likewise in Chesnut Street and other
Streets which made me then think the Inhabitants of the City were
deserting it one after anotherOur Debates possessd me so fully of
the Subject that I wrote and printed an anonymous Pamphlet on it
entituled The Nature and Necessity of a Paper Currency It was well
receivd by the common People in general but the Rich Men dislikd it
for it increasd and strengthend the Clamour for more Money and they
happening to have no Writers among them that were able to answer it
their Opposition slackend and the Point was carried by a Majority in
the House My Friends there who conceivd I had been of some Service
thought fit to reward me by employing me in printing the Money a very
profitable Jobb and a great Help to meThis was another Advantage
gaind by my being able to write The Utility of this Currency became
by Time and Experience so evident as never afterwards to be much
disputed so that it grew soon to  and in  to  since
which it arose during War to upwards of  Trade Building and
Inhabitants all the while increasing Tho I now think there are Limits
beyond which the Quantity may be hurtful

I soon after obtaind thro my Friend Hamilton the Printing of the New
Castle Paper Money another profitable Jobb as I then thought it small
Things appearing great to those in small Circumstances And these to me
were really great Advantages as they were great Encouragements He
procured me also the Printing of the Laws and Votes of that Government
which continud in my Hands as long as I followd the Business

I now opend a little Stationers Shop I had in it Blanks of all
Sorts the correctest that ever appeard among us being assisted in
that by my Friend Brientnal I had also Paper Parchment Chapmens
Books etc One Whitemarsh a Compositor I had known in London an
excellent Workman now came to me and workd with me constantly and
diligently and I took an Apprentice the Son of Aquila Rose I began now
gradually to pay off the Debt I was under for the PrintingHouse In
order to secure my Credit and Character as a Tradesman I took care not
only to be in Reality Industrious and frugal but to avoid all
Appearances of the Contrary I drest plainly I was seen at no Places
of idle Diversion I never went out a fishing or Shooting a Book
indeed sometimes debauchd me from my Work but that was seldom snug
and gave no Scandal and to show that I was not above my Business I
sometimes brought home the Paper I purchasd at the Stores thro the
Streets on a Wheelbarrow Thus being esteemd an industrious thriving
young Man and paying duly for what I bought the Merchants who
imported Stationary solicited my Custom others proposd supplying me
with Books I went on swimminglyIn the mean time Keimers Credit and
Business declining daily he was at last forcd to sell his
Printinghouse to satisfy his Creditors He went to Barbadoes there
lived some Years in very poor Circumstances

His Apprentice David Harry whom I had instructed while I workd with
him set up in his place at Philadelphia having bought his Materials I
was at first apprehensive of a powerful Rival in Harry as his Friends
were very able and had a good deal of Interest I therefore proposd a
Partnership to him which he fortunately for me rejected with Scorn
He was very proud dressd like a Gentleman livd expensively took
much Diversion and Pleasure abroad ran in debt and neglected his
Business upon which all Business left him and finding nothing to do
he followd Keimer to Barbadoes taking the Printinghouse with him
There this Apprentice employd his former Master as a Journeyman They
quarreld often Harry went continually behindhand and at length was
forcd to sell his Types and return to his Country work in Pensilvania
The Person that bought them employd Keimer to use them but in a few
years he died There remaind now no Competitor with me at Philadelphia
but the old one Bradford who was rich and easy did a little Printing
now and then by straggling Hands but was not very anxious about it
However as he kept the Post Office it was imagined he had better
Opportunities of obtaining News his Paper was thought a better
Distributer of Advertisements than mine and therefore had many more
which was a profitable thing to him and a Disadvantage to me For tho I
did indeed receive and send Papers by Post yet the publick Opinion was
otherwise for what I did send was by Bribing the Riders who took them
privately Bradford being unkind enough to forbid it which occasiond
some Resentment on my Part and I thought so meanly of him for it that
when I afterwards came into his Situation I took care never to imitate
it

I had hitherto continud to board with Godfrey who lived in Part of my
House with his Wife and Children and had one Side of the Shop for his
Glaziers Business tho he workd little being always absorbd in his
MathematicsMrs Godfrey projected a Match for me with a Relations
Daughter took Opportunities of bringing us often together till a
serious Courtship on my Part ensud the Girl being in herself very
deserving The old Folks encouragd me by continual Invitations to
Supper and by leaving us together till at length it was time to
explain Mrs Godfrey managd our little Treaty I let her know that I
expected as much Money with their Daughter as would pay off my Remaining
Debt for the Printinghouse which I believe was not then above a Hundred
Pounds She brought me Word they had no such Sum to spare I said they
might mortgage their House in the Loan OfficeThe Answer to this after
some Days was that they did not approve the Match that on Enquiry of
Bradford they had been informd the Printing Business was not a
profitable one the Types would soon be worn out and more wanted that
S Keimer and D Harry had faild one after the other and I should
probably soon follow them and therefore I was forbidden the House and
the Daughter shut upWhether this was a real Change of Sentiment or
only Artifice on a Supposition of our being too far engagd in
Affection to retract and therefore that we should steal a Marriage
which would leave them at Liberty to give or withhold what they
pleasd I know not But I suspected the latter resented it and went
no more Mrs Godfrey brought me afterwards some more favourable
Accounts of their Disposition and would have drawn me on again But I
declared absolutely my Resolution to have nothing more to do with that
Family This was resented by the Godfreys we differd and they
removed leaving me the whole House and I resolved to take no more
Inmates But this Affair having turnd my Thoughts to Marriage I lookd
round me and made Overtures of Acquaintance in other Places but soon
found that the Business of a Printer being generally thought a poor one
I was not to expect Money with a Wife unless with such a one as I
should not otherwise think agreableIn the mean time that
hardtobegovernd Passion of Youth had hurried me frequently into
Intrigues with low Women that fell in my Way which were attended with
some Expence and great Inconvenience besides a continual Risque to my
Health by a Distemper which of all Things I dreaded tho by great good
Luck I escaped it

A friendly Correspondence as Neighbours and old Acquaintances had
continued between me and Mrs Reads Family who all had a Regard for me
from the time of my first Lodging in their House I was often invited
there and consulted in their Affairs wherein I sometimes was of
serviceI pityd poor Miss Reads unfortunate Situation who was
generally dejected seldom chearful and avoided Company I considerd
my Giddiness and Inconstancy when in London as in a great degree the
Cause of her Unhappiness tho the Mother was good enough to think the
Fault more her own than mine as she had prevented our Marrying before I
went thither and persuaded the other Match in my Absence Our mutual
Affection was revived but there were now great Objections to our Union
That Match was indeed lookd upon as invalid a preceding Wife being
said to be living in England but this could not easily be provd
because of the Distance And tho there was a Report of his Death it
was not certain Then tho it should be true he had left many Debts
which his Successor might be calld on to pay We ventured however
over all these Difficulties and I took her to Wife Sept  
None of the Inconveniencies happened that we had apprehended she
provd a good and faithful Helpmate assisted me much by attending the
Shop we throve together and have ever mutually endeavourd to make
each other happy Thus I corrected that great Erratum as well as I
could

About this Time our Club meeting not at a Tavern but in a little
Room of Mr Graces set apart for that Purpose a Proposition was made
by me that since our Books were often referrd to in our Disquisitions
upon the Queries it might be convenient to us to have them all together
where we met that upon Occasion they might be consulted and by thus
clubbing our Books to a common Library we should while we likd to
keep them together have each of us the Advantage of using the Books of
all the other Members which would be nearly as beneficial as if each
owned the whole It was likd and agreed to and we filld one End of
the Room with such Books as we could best spare The Number was not so
great as we expected and tho they had been of great Use yet some
Inconveniencies occurring for want of due Care of them the Collection
after about a Year was separated and each took his Books home again

And now I sent on foot my first Project of a public Nature that for a
Subscription Library I drew up the Proposals got them put into Form
by our great Scrivener Brockden and by the help of my Friends in the
Junto procurd Fifty Subscribers of  each to begin with and  a
Year for  Years the Term our Company was to continue We afterwards
obtaind a Charter the Company being increasd to  This was the
Mother of all the N American Subscription Libraries now so numerous is
become a great thing itself and continually increasingThese
Libraries have improvd the general Conversation of the Americans made
the common Tradesmen and Farmers as intelligent as most Gentlemen from
other Countries and perhaps have contributed in some degree to the
Stand so generally made throughout the Colonies in Defence of their
Privileges

                                   

This library afforded me the means of improvement by constant study for
which I set apart an hour or two each day and thus repaird in some
degree the loss of the learned education my father once intended for me
Reading was the only amusement I allowd myself I spent no time in
taverns games or frolicks of any kind and my industry in my business
continud as indefatigable as it was necessary I was indebted for my
printinghouse I had a young family coming on to be educated and I had
to contend with for business two printers who were established in the
place before me My circumstances however grew daily easier My
original habits of frugality continuing and my father having among his
instructions to me when a boy frequently repeated a proverb of Solomon
Seest thou a man diligent in his calling he shall stand before kings
he shall not stand before mean men I from thence considered industry
as a means of obtaining wealth and distinction which encouragd me
tho I did not think that I should ever literally stand before kings
which however has since happened for I have stood before five and
even had the honour of sitting down with one the King of Denmark to
dinner

We have an English proverb that says He that would thrive must ask
his wife It was lucky for me that I had one as much disposd to
industry and frugality as myself She assisted me chearfully in my
business folding and stitching pamphlets tending shop purchasing old
linen rags for the papermakers etc etc We kept no idle servants
our table was plain and simple our furniture of the cheapest For
instance my breakfast was a long time bread and milk no tea and I
ate it out of a twopenny earthen porringer with a pewter spoon But
mark how luxury will enter families and make a progress in spite of
principle being calld one morning to breakfast I found it in a China
bowl with a spoon of silver They had been bought for me without my
knowledge by my wife and had cost her the enormous sum of
threeandtwenty shillings for which she had no other excuse or apology
to make but that she thought her husband deservd a silver spoon and
China bowl as well as any of his neighbors This was the first
appearance of plate and China in our house which afterward in a course
of years as our wealth increasd augmented gradually to several
hundred pounds in value

I had been religiously educated as a Presbyterian and tho some of the
dogmas of that persuasion such as the eternal decrees of God
election reprobation etc appeared to me unintelligible others
doubtful and I early absented myself from the public assemblies of the
sect Sunday being my studying day I never was without some religious
principles I never doubted for instance the existence of the Deity
that he made the world and governd it by his Providence that the most
acceptable service of God was the doing good to man that our souls are
immortal and that all crime will be punished and virtue rewarded
either here or hereafter These I esteemd the essentials of every
religion and being to be found in all the religions we had in our
country I respected them all tho with different degrees of respect
as I found them more or less mixd with other articles which without
any tendency to inspire promote or confirm morality servd
principally to divide us and make us unfriendly to one another This
respect to all with an opinion that the worst had some good effects
inducd me to avoid all discourse that might tend to lessen the good
opinion another might have of his own religion and as our province
increasd in people and new places of worship were continually wanted
and generally erected by voluntary contribution my mite for such
purpose whatever might be the sect was never refused

Tho I seldom attended any public worship I had still an opinion of its
propriety and of its utility when rightly conducted and I regularly
paid my annual subscription for the support of the only Presbyterian
minister or meeting we had in Philadelphia He usd to visit me
sometimes as a friend and admonish me to attend his administrations
and I was now and then prevaild on to do so once for five Sundays
successively Had he been in my opinion a good preacher perhaps I might
have continued notwithstanding the occasion I had for the Sundays
leisure in my course of study but his discourses were chiefly either
polemic arguments or explications of the peculiar doctrines of our
sect and were all to me very dry uninteresting and unedifying since
not a single moral principle was inculcated or enforcd their aim
seeming to be rather to make us Presbyterians than good citizens

At length he took for his text that verse of the fourth chapter of
Philippians Finally brethren whatsoever things are true honest
just pure lovely or of good report if there be any virtue or any
praise think on these things And I imagind in a sermon on such a
text we could not miss of having some morality But he confind himself
to five points only as meant by the apostle viz  Keeping holy the
Sabbath day  Being diligent in reading the holy Scriptures 
Attending duly the publick worship  Partaking of the Sacrament 
Paying a due respect to Gods ministers These might be all good things
but as they were not the kind of good things that I expected from that
text I despaired of ever meeting with them from any other was
disgusted and attended his preaching no more I had some years before
composd a little Liturgy or form of prayer for my own private use
viz in  entitled Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion I
returnd to the use of this and went no more to the public assemblies
My conduct might be blameable but I leave it without attempting
further to excuse it my present purpose being to relate facts and not
to make apologies for them

It was about this time I conceivd the bold and arduous project of
arriving at moral perfection I wishd to live without committing any
fault at any time I would conquer all that either natural inclination
custom or company might lead me into As I knew or thought I knew
what was right and wrong I did not see why I might not always do the
one and avoid the other But I soon found I had undertaken a task of
more difficulty than I had imagined While my care was employd in
guarding against one fault I was often surprised by another habit took
the advantage of inattention inclination was sometimes too strong for
reason I concluded at length that the mere speculative conviction
that it was our interest to be completely virtuous was not sufficient
to prevent our slipping and that the contrary habits must be broken
and good ones acquired and established before we can have any
dependence on a steady uniform rectitude of conduct For this purpose I
therefore contrived the following method

In the various enumerations of the moral virtues I had met with in my
reading I found the catalogue more or less numerous as different
writers included more or fewer ideas under the same name Temperance
for example was by some confined to eating and drinking while by
others it was extended to mean the moderating every other pleasure
appetite inclination or passion bodily or mental even to our avarice
and ambition I proposd to myself for the sake of clearness to use
rather more names with fewer ideas annexd to each than a few names
with more ideas and I included under thirteen names of virtues all that
at that time occurrd to me as necessary or desirable and annexed to
each a short precept which fully expressd the extent I gave to its
meaning

These names of virtues with their precepts were

 TEMPERANCE

Eat not to dullness drink not to elevation

 SILENCE

Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself avoid trifling
conversation

 ORDER

Let all your things have their places let each part of your business
have its time

 RESOLUTION

Resolve to perform what you ought perform without fail what you
resolve

 FRUGALITY

Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself ie waste
nothing

 INDUSTRY

Lose no time be always employd in something useful cut off all
unnecessary actions

 SINCERITY

Use no hurtful deceit think innocently and justly and if you speak
speak accordingly

 JUSTICE

Wrong none by doing injuries or omitting the benefits that are your
duty

 MODERATION

Avoid extreams forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they
deserve

 CLEANLINESS

Tolerate no uncleanliness in body cloaths or habitation

 TRANQUILLITY

Be not disturbed at trifles or at accidents common or unavoidable

 CHASTITY

Rarely use venery but for health or offspring never to dulness
weakness or the injury of your own or anothers peace or reputation

 HUMILITY

Imitate Jesus and Socrates

My intention being to acquire the habitude of all these virtues I
judgd it would be well not to distract my attention by attempting the
whole at once but to fix it on one of them at a time and when I
should be master of that then to proceed to another and so on till I
should have gone thro the thirteen and as the previous acquisition of
some might facilitate the acquisition of certain others I arrangd them
with that view as they stand above Temperance first as it tends to
procure that coolness and clearness of head which is so necessary where
constant vigilance was to be kept up and guard maintained against the
unremitting attraction of ancient habits and the force of perpetual
temptations This being acquird and establishd Silence would be more
easy and my desire being to gain knowledge at the same time that I
improvd in virtue and considering that in conversation it was obtaind
rather by the use of the ears than of the tongue and therefore wishing
to break a habit I was getting into of prattling punning and joking
which only made me acceptable to trifling company I gave Silence the
second place This and the next Order I expected would allow me more
time for attending to my project and my studies Resolution once
become habitual would keep me firm in my endeavours to obtain all the
subsequent virtues Frugality and Industry freeing me from my
remaining debt and producing affluence and independence would make
more easy the practice of Sincerity and Justice etc etc Conceiving
then that agreeably to the advice of Pythagoras in his Golden
Verses daily examination would be necessary I contrived the following
method for conducting that examination

I made a little book in which I allotted a page for each of the
virtues I ruld each page with red ink so as to have seven columns
one for each day of the week marking each column with a letter for the
day I crossd these columns with thirteen red lines marking the
beginning of each line with the first letter of one of the virtues on
which line and in its proper column I might mark by a little black
spot every fault I found upon examination to have been committed
respecting that virtue upon that day

            Form of the Pages
      
               TEMPERANCE

I determined to give a weeks strict attention to each of the virtues
successively Thus in the first week my great guard was to avoid every
the least offence against Temperance leaving the other virtues to
their ordinary chance only marking every evening the faults of the day
Thus if in the first week I could keep my first line marked T clear
of spots I supposd the habit of that virtue so much strengthend and
its opposite weakend that I might ventureextending my attention to
include the next and for the following week keep both lines clear of
spots Proceeding thus to the last I could go thro a course compleat
in thirteen weeks and four courses in a year And like him who having
a garden to weed does not attempt to eradicate all the bad herbs at
once which would exceed his reach and his strength but works on one of
the beds at a time and having accomplishd the first proceeds to a
second so I should have I hoped the encouraging pleasure of seeing on
my pages the progress I made in virtue by clearing successively my
lines of their spots till in the end by a number of courses I should
be happy in viewing a clean book after a thirteen weeks daily
examination

This my little book had for its motto these lines from Addisons Cato

    Here will I hold If theres a power above us
    And that there is all nature cries aloud
    Thro all her works He must delight in virtue
    And that which he delights in must be happy

Another from Cicero

    O vit Philosophia dux O virtutum indagatrix expultrixque
    vitiorum Unus dies bene et ex prceptis tuis actus
    peccanti immortalitati est anteponendus

Another from the Proverbs of Solomon speaking of wisdom or virtue

    Length of days is in her right hand and in her left hand
    riches and honour Her ways are ways of pleasantness and all
    her paths are peaceiii  

And conceiving God to be the fountain of wisdom I thought it right and
necessary to solicit his assistance for obtaining it to this end I
formed the following little prayer which was prefixd to my tables of
examination for daily use

    O powerful Goodness bountiful Father merciful Guide
    Increase in me that wisdom which discovers my truest
    interest Strengthen my resolutions to perform what that
    wisdom dictates Accept my kind offices to thy other children
    as the only return in my power for thy continual favours to
    me

I used also sometimes a little prayer which I took from Thomsons
Poems viz

    Father of light and life thou Good Supreme
    O teach me what is good teach me Thyself
    Save me from folly vanity and vice
    From every low pursuit and fill my soul
    With knowledge conscious peace and virtue pure
    Sacred substantial neverfading bliss

The precept of Order requiring that every part of my business should
have its allotted time one page in my little book containd the
following scheme of employment for the twentyfour hours of a natural
day

       THE MORNING         Rise wash and address Powerful
  Question What good     Goodness Contrive days business
  shall I do this day       and take the resolution of the

          NIGHT            Sleep
                           
                           
                           

I enterd upon the execution of this plan for selfexamination and
continud it with occasional intermissions for some time I was
surprisd to find myself so much fuller of faults than I had imagined
but I had the satisfaction of seeing them diminish To avoid the trouble
of renewing now and then my little book which by scraping out the
marks on the paper of old faults to make room for new ones in a new
course became full of holes I transferrd my tables and precepts to
the ivory leaves of a memorandum book on which the lines were drawn
with red ink that made a durable stain and on those lines I markd my
faults with a blacklead pencil which marks I could easily wipe out
with a wet sponge After a while I went thro one course only in a year
and afterward only one in several years till at length I omitted them
entirely being employd in voyages and business abroad with a
multiplicity of affairs that interfered but I always carried my little
book with me

My scheme of ORDER gave me the most trouble and I found that tho it
might be practicable where a mans business was such as to leave him the
disposition of his time that of a journeyman printer for instance it
was not possible to be exactly observed by a master who must mix with
the world and often receive people of business at their own hours
Order too with regard to places for things papers etc I found
extreamly difficult to acquire I had not been early accustomed to it
and having an exceeding good memory I was not so sensible of the
inconvenience attending want of method This article therefore cost me
so much painful attention and my faults in it vexed me so much and I
made so little progress in amendment and had such frequent relapses
that I was almost ready to give up the attempt and content myself with
a faulty character in that respect like the man who in buying an ax of
a smith my neighbour desired to have the whole of its surface as
bright as the edge The smith consented to grind it bright for him if he
would turn the wheel he turnd while the smith pressd the broad face
of the ax hard and heavily on the stone which made the turning of it
very fatiguing The man came every now and then from the wheel to see
how the work went on and at length would take his ax as it was without
farther grinding No said the smith turn on turn on we shall have
it bright byandby as yet it is only speckled Yes says the man
but I think I like a speckled ax best And I believe this may have
been the case with many who having for want of some such means as I
employd found the difficulty of obtaining good and breaking bad habits
in other points of vice and virtue have given up the struggle and
concluded that a speckled ax was best for something that pretended
to be reason was every now and then suggesting to me that such extream
nicety as I exacted of myself might be a kind of foppery in morals
which if it were known would make me ridiculous that a perfect
character might be attended with the inconvenience of being envied and
hated and that a benevolent man should allow a few faults in himself
to keep his friends in countenance

In truth I found myself incorrigible with respect to Order and now I
am grown old and my memory bad I feel very sensibly the want of it
But on the whole tho I never arrived at the perfection I had been so
ambitious of obtaining but fell far short of it yet I was by the
endeavour a better and a happier man than I otherwise should have been
if I had not attempted it as those who aim at perfect writing by
imitating the engraved copies tho they never reach the wishdfor
excellence of those copies their hand is mended by the endeavour and
is tolerable while it continues fair and legible

It may be well my posterity should be informed that to this little
artifice with the blessing of God their ancestor owd the constant
felicity of his life down to his th year in which this is written
What reverses may attend the remainder is in the hand of Providence
but if they arrive the reflection on past happiness enjoyd ought to
help his bearing them with more resignation To Temperance he ascribes
his longcontinued health and what is still left to him of a good
constitution to Industry and Frugality the early easiness of his
circumstances and acquisition of his fortune with all that knowledge
that enabled him to be a useful citizen and obtained for him some
degree of reputation among the learned to Sincerity and Justice the
confidence of his country and the honorable employs it conferred upon
him and to the joint influence of the whole mass of the virtues even
in the imperfect state he was able to acquire them all that evenness of
temper and that cheerfulness in conversation which makes his company
still sought for and agreeable even to his younger acquaintance I
hope therefore that some of my descendants may follow the example and
reap the benefit

It will be remarkd that tho my scheme was not wholly without
religion there was in it no mark of any of the distinguishing tenets of
any particular sect I had purposely avoided them for being fully
persuaded of the utility and excellency of my method and that it might
be serviceable to people in all religions and intending some time or
other to publish it I would not have any thing in it that should
prejudice any one of any sect against it I purposed writing a little
comment on each virtue in which I would have shown the advantages of
possessing it and the mischiefs attending its opposite vice and I
should have called my book THE ART OF VIRTUEE because it would have
shown the means and manner of obtaining virtue which would have
distinguished it from the mere exhortation to be good that does not
instruct and indicate the means but is like the apostles man of verbal
charity who only without showing to the naked and hungry how or where
they might get clothes or victuals exhorted them to be fed and
clothedJames ii  

  E Nothing so likely to make a mans fortune as virtue
  Franklins note

But it so happened that my intention of writing and publishing this
comment was never fulfilled I did indeed from time to time put down
short hints of the sentiments reasonings etc to be made use of in
it some of which I have still by me but the necessary close attention
to private business in the earlier part of my life and public business
since have occasioned my postponing it for it being connected in my
mind with a great and extensive project that required the whole man
to execute and which an unforeseen succession of employs prevented my
attending to it has hitherto remaind unfinishd

In this piece it was my design to explain and enforce this doctrine
that vicious actions are not hurtful because they are forbidden but
forbidden because they are hurtful the nature of man alone considered
that it was therefore every ones interest to be virtuous who wishd
to be happy even in this world and I should from this circumstance
there being always in the world a number of rich merchants nobility
states and princes who have need of honest instruments for the
management of their affairs and such being so rare have endeavoured
to convince young persons that no qualities were so likely to make a
poor mans fortune as those of probity and integrity

My list of virtues containd at first but twelve but a Quaker friend
having kindly informed me that I was generally thought proud that my
pride showd itself frequently in conversation that I was not content
with being in the right when discussing any point but was overbearing
and rather insolent of which he convincd me by mentioning several
instances I determined endeavouring to cure myself if I could of this
vice or folly among the rest and I added Humility to my list giving
an extensive meaning to the word

I cannot boast of much success in acquiring the reality of this
virtue but I had a good deal with regard to the appearance of it I
made it a rule to forbear all direct contradiction to the sentiments of
others and all positive assertion of my own I even forbid myself
agreeably to the old laws of our Junto the use of every word or
expression in the language that imported a fixd opinion such as
certainly undoubtedly etc and I adopted instead of them I
conceive I apprehend or I imagine a thing to be so or so or it
so appears to me at present When another asserted something that I
thought an error I denyd myself the pleasure of contradicting him
abruptly and of showing immediately some absurdity in his proposition
and in answering I began by observing that in certain cases or
circumstances his opinion would be right but in the present case there
appeard or seemd to me some difference etc I soon found the
advantage of this change in my manner the conversations I engagd in
went on more pleasantly The modest way in which I proposd my opinions
procurd them a readier reception and less contradiction I had less
mortification when I was found to be in the wrong and I more easily
prevaild with others to give up their mistakes and join with me when I
happened to be in the right

And this mode which I at first put on with some violence to natural
inclination became at length so easy and so habitual to me that
perhaps for these fifty years past no one has ever heard a dogmatical
expression escape me And to this habit after my character of
integrity I think it principally owing that I had early so much weight
with my fellowcitizens when I proposed new institutions or alterations
in the old and so much influence in public councils when I became a
member for I was but a bad speaker never eloquent subject to much
hesitation in my choice of words hardly correct in language and yet I
generally carried my points

In reality there is perhaps no one of our natural passions so hard to
subdue as pride Disguise it struggle with it beat it down stifle
it mortify it as much as one pleases it is still alive and will every
now and then peep out and show itself you will see it perhaps often
in this history for even if I could conceive that I had compleatly
overcome it I should probably be proud of my humility

Having mentioned a great and extensive project which I had conceivd
it seems proper that some account should be here given of that project
and its object Its first rise in my mind appears in the following
little paper accidentally preservd viz

    Observations on my reading history in Library May th
    

    That the great affairs of the world the wars revolutions
    etc are carried on and affected by parties

    That the view of these parties is their present general
    interest or what they take to be such

    That the different views of these different parties occasion
    all confusion

    That while a party is carrying on a general design each man
    has his particular private interest in view

    That as soon as a party has gaind its general point each
    member becomes intent upon his particular interest which
    thwarting others breaks that party into divisions and
    occasions more confusion

    That few in public affairs act from a meer view of the good
    of their country whatever they may pretend and tho their
    actings bring real good to their country yet men primarily
    considered that their own and their countrys interest was
    united and did not act from a principle of benevolence

    That fewer still in public affairs act with a view to the
    good of mankind

    There seems to me at present to be great occasion for
    raising a United Party for Virtue by forming the virtuous
    and good men of all nations into a regular body to be
    governd by suitable good and wise rules which good and wise
    men may probably be more unanimous in their obedience to
    than common people are to common laws

    I at present think that whoever attempts this aright and is
    well qualified can not fail of pleasing God and of meeting
    with success

                                                           B F

Revolving this project in my mind as to be undertaken hereafter when
my circumstances should afford me the necessary leisure I put down from
time to time on pieces of paper such thoughts as occurrd to me
respecting it Most of these are lost but I find one purporting to be
the substance of an intended creed containing as I thought the
essentials of every known religion and being free of every thing that
might shock the professors of any religion It is expressd in these
words viz

    That there is one God who made all things

    That he governs the world by his providence

    That he ought to be worshiped by adoration prayer and
    thanksgiving

    But that the most acceptable service of God is doing good to
    man

    That the soul is immortal

    And that God will certainly reward virtue and punish vice
    either here or hereafter

My ideas at that time were that the sect should be begun and spread at
first among young and single men only that each person to be initiated
should not only declare his assent to such creed but should have
exercised himself with the thirteen weeks examination and practice of
the virtues as in the beforementiond model that the existence of
such a society should be kept a secret till it was become considerable
to prevent solicitations for the admission of improper persons but that
the members should each of them search among his acquaintance for
ingenuous welldisposed youths to whom with prudent caution the
scheme should be gradually communicated that the members should engage
to afford their advice assistance and support to each other in
promoting one anothers interests business and advancement in life
that for distinction we should be calld The Society of the Free and
Easy free as being by the general practice and habit of the virtues
free from the dominion of vice and particularly by the practice of
industry and frugality free from debt which exposes a man to
confinement and a species of slavery to his creditors

This is as much as I can now recollect of the project except that I
communicated it in part to two young men who adopted it with some
enthusiasm but my then narrow circumstances and the necessity I was
under of sticking close to my business occasiond my postponing the
further prosecution of it at that time and my multifarious occupations
public and private inducd me to continue postponing so that it has
been omitted till I have no longer strength or activity left sufficient
for such an enterprise tho I am still of opinion that it was a
practicable scheme and might have been very useful by forming a great
number of good citizens and I was not discouragd by the seeming
magnitude of the undertaking as I have always thought that one man of
tolerable abilities may work great changes and accomplish great affairs
among mankind if he first forms a good plan and cutting off all
amusements or other employments that would divert his attention makes
the execution of that same plan his sole study and business

In  I first publishd my Almanack under the name of Richard
Saunders it was continud by me about twentyfive years commonly
calld Poor Richards Almanack I endeavourd to make it both
entertaining and useful and it accordingly came to be in such demand
that I reapd considerable profit from it vending annually near ten
thousand And observing that it was generally read scarce any
neighborhood in the province being without it I considerd it as a
proper vehicle for conveying instruction among the common people who
bought scarcely any other books I therefore filled all the little
spaces that occurrd between the remarkable days in the calendar with
proverbial sentences chiefly such as inculcated industry and frugality
as the means of procuring wealth and thereby securing virtue it being
more difficult for a man in want to act always honestly as to use
here one of those proverbs it is hard for an empty sack to stand
upright

These proverbs which contained the wisdom of many ages and nations I
assembled and formd into a connected discourse prefixd to the Almanack
of  as the harangue of a wise old man to the people attending an
auction The bringing all these scatterd counsels thus into a focus
enabled them to make greater impression The piece being universally
approved was copied in all the newspapers of the Continent reprinted
in Britain on a broad side to be stuck up in houses two translations
were made of it in French and great numbers bought by the clergy and
gentry to distribute gratis among their poor parishioners and tenants
In Pennsylvania as it discouraged useless expense in foreign
superfluities some thought it had its share of influence in producing
that growing plenty of money which was observable for several years
after its publication

I considered my newspaper also as another means of communicating
instruction and in that view frequently reprinted in it extracts from
the Spectator and other moral writers and sometimes publishd little
pieces of my own which had been first composd for reading in our
Junto Of these are a Socratic dialogue tending to prove that whatever
might be his parts and abilities a vicious man could not properly be
called a man of sense and a discourse on selfdenial showing that
virtue was not secure till its practice became a habitude and was free
from the opposition of contrary inclinations These may be found in the
papers about the beginning of 

In the conduct of my newspaper I carefully excluded all libelling and
personal abuse which is of late years become so disgraceful to our
country Whenever I was solicited to insert any thing of that kind and
the writers pleaded as they generally did the liberty of the press
and that a newspaper was like a stagecoach in which any one who would
pay had a right to a place my answer was that I would print the piece
separately if desired and the author might have as many copies as he
pleased to distribute himself but that I would not take upon me to
spread his detraction and that having contracted with my subscribers
to furnish them with what might be either useful or entertaining I
could not fill their papers with private altercation in which they had
no concern without doing them manifest injustice Now many of our
printers make no scruple of gratifying the malice of individuals by
false accusations of the fairest characters among ourselves augmenting
animosity even to the producing of duels and are moreover so
indiscreet as to print scurrilous reflections on the government of
neighboring states and even on the conduct of our best national allies
which may be attended with the most pernicious consequences These
things I mention as a caution to young printers and that they may be
encouraged not to pollute their presses and disgrace their profession
by such infamous practices but refuse steadily as they may see by my
example that such a course of conduct will not on the whole be
injurious to their interests

                                   

I had begun in  to study languages I soon made myself so much a
master of the French as to be able to read the books with ease I then
undertook the Italian An acquaintance who was also learning it usd
often to tempt me to play chess with him Finding this took up too much
of the time I had to spare for study I at length refusd to play any
more unless on this condition that the victor in every game should
have a right to impose a task either in parts of the grammar to be got
by heart or in translations etc which tasks the vanquishd was to
perform upon honour before our next meeting As we playd pretty
equally we thus beat one another into that language I afterwards with
a little painstaking acquird as much of the Spanish as to read their
books also

I have already mentiond that I had only one years instruction in a
Latin school and that when very young after which I neglected that
language entirely But when I had attained an acquaintance with the
French Italian and Spanish I was surprizd to find on looking over a
Latin Testament that I understood so much more of that language than I
had imagined which encouraged me to apply myself again to the study of
it and I met with more success as those preceding languages had
greatly smoothd my way

From these circumstances I have thought that there is some
inconsistency in our common mode of teaching languages We are told that
it is proper to begin first with the Latin and having acquird that
it will be more easy to attain those modern languages which are derivd
from it and yet we do not begin with the Greek in order more easily to
acquire the Latin It is true that if you can clamber and get to the
top of a staircase without using the steps you will more easily gain
them in descending but certainly if you begin with the lowest you will
with more ease ascend to the top and I would therefore offer it to the
consideration of those who superintend the education of our youth
whether since many of those who begin with the Latin quit the same
after spending some years without having made any great proficiency and
what they have learnt becomes almost useless so that their time has
been lost it would not have been better to have begun with the French
proceeding to the Italian etc for tho after spending the same
time they should quit the study of languages and never arrive at the
Latin they would however have acquired another tongue or two that
being in modern use might be serviceable to them in common life

                                   

Our club the Junto was found so useful and afforded such satisfaction
to the members that several were desirous of introducing their friends
which could not well be done without exceeding what we had settled as a
convenient number viz twelve We had from the beginning made it a
rule to keep our institution a secret which was pretty well observd
the intention was to avoid applications of improper persons for
admittance some of whom perhaps we might find it difficult to refuse
I was one of those who were against any addition to our number but
instead of it made in writing a proposal that every member separately
should endeavour to form a subordinate club with the same rules
respecting queries etc and without informing them of the connection
with the Junto The advantages proposed were the improvement of so many
more young citizens by the use of our institutions our better
acquaintance with the general sentiments of the inhabitants on any
occasion as the Junto member might propose what queries we should
desire and was to report to the Junto what passd in his separate club
the promotion of our particular interests in business by more extensive
recommendation and the increase of our influence in public affairs and
our power of doing good by spreading thro the several clubs the
sentiments of the Junto

The project was approvd and every member undertook to form his club
but they did not all succeed Five or six only were compleated which
were called by different names as the Vine the Union the Band etc
They were useful to themselves and afforded us a good deal of
amusement information and instruction besides answering in some
considerable degree our views of influencing the public opinion on
particular occasions of which I shall give some instances in course of
time as they happened

                                   

I began now to turn my thoughts a little to public affairs
beginning however with small matters The city watch was one of the
first things that I conceivd to want regulation It was managed by the
constables of the respective wards in turn the constable warned a
number of housekeepers to attend him for the night Those who chose
never to attend paid him six shillings a year to be excusd which was
supposd to be for hiring substitutes but was in reality much more
than was necessary for that purpose and made the constableship a place
of profit and the constable for a little drink often got such
ragamuffins about him as a watch that respectable housekeepers did not
choose to mix with Walking the rounds too was often neglected and
most of the nights spent in tippling I thereupon wrote a paper to be
read in Junto representing these irregularities but insisting more
particularly on the inequality of this sixshilling tax of the
constables respecting the circumstances of those who paid it since a
poor widow housekeeper all whose property to be guarded by the watch
did not perhaps exceed the value of fifty pounds paid as much as the
wealthiest merchant who had thousands of pounds worth of goods in his
stores

On the whole I proposed as a more effectual watch the hiring of proper
men to serve constantly in that business and as a more equitable way of
supporting the charge the levying a tax that should be proportiond to
the property This idea being approvd by the Junto was communicated
to the other clubs but as arising in each of them and though the plan
was not immediately carried into execution yet by preparing the minds
of people for the change it paved the way for the law obtained a few
years after when the members of our clubs were grown into more
influence

About this time I wrote a paper first to be read in Junto but it was
afterward publishd on the different accidents and carelessnesses by
which houses were set on fire with cautions against them and means
proposed of avoiding them This was much spoken of as a useful piece
and gave rise to a project which soon followed it of forming a company
for the more ready extinguishing of fires and mutual assistance in
removing and securing of goods when in danger Associates in this scheme
were presently found amounting to thirty Our articles of agreement
obligd every member to keep always in good order and fit for use a
certain number of leather buckets with strong bags and baskets for
packing and transporting of goods which were to be brought to every
fire and we agreed to meet once a month and spend a social evening
together in discoursing and communicating such ideas as occurred to us
upon the subject of fires as might be useful in our conduct on such
occasions

The utility of this institution soon appeared and many more desiring to
be admitted than we thought convenient for one company they were
advised to form another which was accordingly done and this went on
one new company being formed after another till they became so numerous
as to include most of the inhabitants who were men of property and now
at the time of my writing this tho upward of fifty years since its
establishment that which I first formed called the Union Fire Company
still subsists and flourishes tho the first members are all deceasd
but myself and one who is older by a year than I am The small fines
that have been paid by members for absence at the monthly meetings have
been applyd to the purchase of fireengines ladders firehooks and
other useful implements for each company so that I question whether
there is a city in the world better provided with the means of putting a
stop to beginning conflagrations and in fact since these
institutions the city has never lost by fire more than one or two
houses at a time and the flames have often been extinguished before the
house in which they began has been half consumed

In  arrived among us from Ireland the Reverend Mr Whitefield who
had made himself remarkable there as an itinerant preacher He was at
first permitted to preach in some of our churches but the clergy
taking a dislike to him soon refusd him their pulpits and he was
obligd to preach in the fields The multitudes of all sects and
denominations that attended his sermons were enormous and it was matter
of speculation to me who was one of the number to observe the
extraordinary influence of his oratory on his hearers and how much they
admird and respected him notwithstanding his common abuse of them by
assuring them they were naturally half beasts and half devils It was
wonderful to see the change soon made in the manners of our inhabitants
From being thoughtless or indifferent about religion it seemd as if
all the world were growing religious so that one could not walk thro
the town in an evening without hearing psalms sung in different families
of every street

                                   

I happened soon after to attend one of his sermons in the course of
which I perceived he intended to finish with a collection and I
silently resolved he should get nothing from me I had in my pocket a
handful of copper money three or four silver dollars and five pistoles
in gold As he proceeded I began to soften and concluded to give the
coppers Another stroke of his oratory made me ashamd of that and
determind me to give the silver and he finishd so admirably that I
emptyd my pocket wholly into the collectors dish gold and all At
this sermon there was also one of our club who being of my sentiments
respecting the building in Georgia and suspecting a collection might be
intended had by precaution emptied his pockets before he came from
home Towards the conclusion of the discourse however he felt a strong
desire to give and applyd to a neighbour who stood near him to
borrow some money for the purpose The application was unfortunately
made to perhaps the only man in the company who had the firmness not
to be affected by the preacher His answer was At any other time
Friend Hopkinson I would lend to thee freely but not now for thee
seems to be out of thy right senses

                                   

He Rev Whitefield usd indeed sometimes to pray for my conversion
but never had the satisfaction of believing that his prayers were heard
Ours was a mere civil friendship sincere on both sides and lasted to
his death

The following instance will show something of the terms on which we
stood Upon one of his arrivals from England at Boston he wrote to me
that he should come soon to Philadelphia but knew not where he could
lodge when there as he understood his old friend and host Mr Benezet
was removed to Germantown My answer was You know my house if you can
make shift with its scanty accommodations you will be most heartily
welcome He replyd that if I made that kind offer for Christs sake
I should not miss of a reward And I returned Dont let me be
mistaken it was not for Christs sake but for your sake One of our
common acquaintance jocosely remarkd that knowing it to be the custom
of the saints when they received any favour to shift the burden of the
obligation from off their own shoulders and place it in heaven I had
contrivd to fix it on earth

The last time I saw Mr Whitefield was in London when he consulted me
about his Orphan House concern and his purpose of appropriating it to
the establishment of a college

He had a loud and clear voice and articulated his words and sentences
so perfectly that he might be heard and understood at a great distance
especially as his auditories however numerous observd the most exact
silence He preachd one evening from the top of the Courthouse steps
which are in the middle of Marketstreet and on the west side of
Secondstreet which crosses it at right angles Both streets were
filld with his hearers to a considerable distance Being among the
hindmost in Marketstreet I had the curiosity to learn how far he could
be heard by retiring backwards down the street towards the river and I
found his voice distinct till I came near Frontstreet when some noise
in that street obscurd it Imagining then a semicircle of which my
distance should be the radius and that it were filld with auditors to
each of whom I allowd two square feet I computed that he might well be
heard by more than thirty thousand This reconcild me to the newspaper
accounts of his having preachd to twentyfive thousand people in the
fields and to the antient histories of generals haranguing whole
armies of which I had some times doubted

                                   

I had on the whole abundant reason to be satisfied with my being
established in Pennsylvania There were however two things that I
regretted there being no provision for defense nor for a compleat
education of youth no militia nor any college I therefore in 
drew up a proposal for establishing an academy and at that time
thinking the Reverend Mr Peters who was out of employ a fit person to
superintend such an institution I communicated the project to him but
he having more profitable views in the service of the proprietaries
which succeeded declind the undertaking and not knowing another at
that time suitable for such a trust I let the scheme lie a while
dormant I succeeded better the next year  in proposing and
establishing a Philosophical Society The paper I wrote for that purpose
will be found among my writings when collected

                                   

Peace being concluded and the association business therefore at an end
I turnd my thoughts again to the affair of establishing an academy The
first step I took was to associate in the design a number of active
friends of whom the Junto furnished a good part the next was to write
and publish a pamphlet entitled Proposals Relating to the Education of
Youth in Pennsylvania This I distributed among the principal
inhabitants gratis and as soon as I could suppose their minds a little
prepared by the perusal of it I set on foot a subscription for opening
and supporting an academy it was to be paid in quotas yearly for five
years by so dividing it I judgd the subscription might be larger and
I believe it was so amounting to no less if I remember right than
five thousand pounds

In the introduction to these proposals I stated their publication not
as an act of mine but of some publickspirited gentlemen avoiding as
much as I could according to my usual rule the presenting myself to
the publick as the author of any scheme for their benefit

The subscribers to carry the project into immediate execution chose
out of their number twentyfour trustees and appointed Mr Francis
then attorneygeneral and myself to draw up constitutions for the
government of the academy which being done and signed a house was
hired masters engagd and the schools opened I think in the same
year 

                                   

In  being at Boston I met there with a Dr Spence who was lately
arrived from Scotland and showd me some electric experiments They
were imperfectly performd as he was not very expert but being on a
subject quite new to me they equally surprisd and pleased me Soon
after my return to Philadelphia our library company receivd from Mr
P Collinson Fellow of the Royal Society of London a present of a
glass tube with some account of the use of it in making such
experiments I eagerly seized the opportunity of repeating what I had
seen at Boston and by much practice acquird great readiness in
performing those also which we had an account of from England adding
a number of new ones I say much practice for my house was continually
full for some time with people who came to see these new wonders

To divide a little this incumbrance among my friends I caused a number
of similar tubes to be blown at our glasshouse with which they
furnishd themselves so that we had at length several performers Among
these the principal was Mr Kinnersley an ingenious neighbor who
being out of business I encouraged to undertake showing the experiments
for money and drew up for him two lectures in which the experiments
were rangd in such order and accompanied with such explanations in
such method as that the foregoing should assist in comprehending the
following He procurd an elegant apparatus for the purpose in which
all the little machines that I had roughly made for myself were nicely
formd by instrumentmakers His lectures were well attended and gave
great satisfaction and after some time he went thro the colonies
exhibiting them in every capital town and pickd up some money In the
West India Islands indeed it was with difficulty the experiments could
be made from the general moisture of the air

Obligd as we were to Mr Collinson for his present of the tube etc I
thought it right he should be informd of our success in using it and
wrote him several letters containing accounts of our experiments He got
them read in the Royal Society where they were not at first thought
worth so much notice as to be printed in their Transactions One paper
which I wrote for Mr Kinnersley on the sameness of lightning with
electricity I sent to Dr Mitchel an acquaintance of mine and one of
the members also of that society who wrote me word that it had been
read but was laughed at by the connoisseurs The papers however being
shown to Dr Fothergill he thought them of too much value to be
stifled and advisd the printing of them Mr Collinson then gave them
to Cave for publication in his Gentlemans Magazine but he chose to
print them separately in a pamphlet and Dr Fothergill wrote the
preface Cave it seems judged rightly for his profit for by the
additions that arrived afterward they swelld to a quarto volume which
has had five editions and cost him nothing for copymoney

It was however some time before those papers were much taken notice of
in England A copy of them happening to fall into the hands of the Count
de Buffon a philosopher deservedly of great reputation in France and
indeed all over Europe he prevailed with M Dalibard to translate them
into French and they were printed at Paris The publication offended
the Abb Nollet preceptor in Natural Philosophy to the royal family
and an able experimenter who had formd and publishd a theory of
electricity which then had the general vogue He could not at first
believe that such a work came from America and said it must have been
fabricated by his enemies at Paris to decry his system Afterwards
having been assurd that there really existed such a person as Franklin
at Philadelphia which he had doubted he wrote and published a volume
of Letters chiefly addressd to me defending his theory and denying
the verity of my experiments and of the positions deducd from them

I once purposd answering the abb and actually began the answer but
on consideration that my writings containd a description of experiments
which any one might repeat and verify and if not to be verifid could
not be defended or of observations offerd as conjectures and not
delivered dogmatically therefore not laying me under any obligation to
defend them and reflecting that a dispute between two persons writing
in different languages might be lengthened greatly by mistranslations
and thence misconceptions of one anothers meaning much of one of the
abbs letters being founded on an error in the translation I concluded
to let my papers shift for themselves believing it was better to spend
what time I could spare from public business in making new experiments
than in disputing about those already made I therefore never answered
M Nollet and the event gave me no cause to repent my silence for my
friend M le Roy of the Royal Academy of Sciences took up my cause and
refuted him my book was translated into the Italian German and Latin
languages and the doctrine it containd was by degrees universally
adopted by the philosophers of Europe in preference to that of the
abb so that he lived to see himself the last of his sect except
Monsieur B of Paris his lve and immediate disciple

What gave my book the more sudden and general celebrity was the success
of one of its proposed experiments made by Messrs Dalibard and De Lor
at Marly for drawing lightning from the clouds This engagd the public
attention every where M de Lor who had an apparatus for experimental
philosophy and lecturd in that branch of science undertook to repeat
what he called the Philadelphia Experiments and after they were
performed before the king and court all the curious of Paris flocked to
see them I will not swell this narrative with an account of that
capital experiment nor of the infinite pleasure I receivd in the
success of a similar one I made soon after with a kite at Philadelphia
as both are to be found in the histories of electricity

Dr Wright an English physician when at Paris wrote to a friend who
was of the Royal Society an account of the high esteem my experiments
were in among the learned abroad and of their wonder that my writings
had been so little noticed in England The Society on this resumd the
consideration of the letters that had been read to them and the
celebrated Dr Watson drew up a summary account of them and of all I
had afterwards sent to England on the subject which he accompanied with
some praise of the writer This summary was then printed in their
Transactions and some members of the Society in London particularly
the very ingenious Mr Canton having verified the experiment of
procuring lightning from the clouds by a pointed rod and acquainting
them with the success they soon made me more than amends for the slight
with which they had before treated me Without my having made any
application for that honour they chose me a member and voted that I
should be excusd the customary payments which would have amounted to
twentyfive guineas and ever since have given me their Transactions
gratis They also presented me with the gold medal of Sir Godfrey Copley
for the year  the delivery of which was accompanied by a very
handsome speech of the president Lord Macclesfield wherein I was
highly honoured

SIR

It may not be improper in the first Place to inform your Readers that I
intend once a Fortnight to present them by the Help of this Paper with
a short Epistle which I presume will add somewhat to their
Entertainment

And since it is observed that the Generality of People now a days are
unwilling either to commend or dispraise what they read until they are
in some measure informed who or what the Author of it is whether he be
poor or rich old or young a Scollar or a Leather Apron
Man c and give their Opinion of the Performance according to the
Knowledge which they have of the Authors Circumstances it may not be
amiss to begin with a short Account of my past Life and present
Condition that the Reader may not be at a Loss to judge whether or no
my Lucubrations are worth his reading

At the time of my Birth my Parents were on Shipboard in their Way from
London to N England My Entrance into this troublesome World was
attended with the Death of my Father a Misfortune which tho I was not
then capable of knowing I shall never be able to forget for as he
poor Man stood upon the Deck rejoycing at my Birth a merciless Wave
entred the Ship and in one Moment carryd him beyond Reprieve Thus was
the first Day which I saw the last that was seen by my Father and
thus was my disconsolate Mother at once made both a Parent and a
Widow

When we arrived at Boston which was not long after I was put to
Nurse in a Country Place at a small Distance from the Town where I
went to School and past my Infancy and Childhood in Vanity and
Idleness until I was bound out Apprentice that I might no longer be a
Charge to my Indigent Mother who was put to hard Shifts for a Living

My Master was a Country Minister a pious goodnaturd young Man  a
Batchelor He labourd with all his Might to instil vertuous and godly
Principles into my tender Soul well knowing that it was the most
suitable Time to make deep and lasting Impressions on the Mind while it
was yet untainted with Vice free and unbiassd He endeavourd that I
might be instructed in all that Knowledge and Learning which is
necessary for our Sex and denyd me no Accomplishment that could
possibly be attained in a Country Place such as all Sorts of
NeedleWork Writing Arithmetick c and observing that I took a more
than ordinary Delight in reading ingenious Books he gave me the free
Use of his Library which tho it was but small yet it was well chose
to inform the Understanding rightly and enable the Mind to frame great
and noble Ideas

Before I had livd quite two Years with this Reverend Gentleman my
indulgent Mother departed this Life leaving me as it were by my self
having no Relation on Earth within my Knowledge

I will not abuse your Patience with a tedious Recital of all the
frivolous Accidents of my Life that happened from this Time until I
arrived to Years of Discretion only inform you that I livd a chearful
Country Life spending my leisure Time either in some innocent Diversion
with the neighbouring Females or in some shady Retirement with the
best of Company Books Thus I past away the Time with a Mixture of
Profit and Pleasure having no Affliction but what was imaginary and
created in my own Fancy as nothing is more common with us Women than
to be grieving for nothing when we have nothing else to grieve for

As I would not engross too much of your Paper at once I will defer the
Remainder of my Story until my next Letter in the mean time desiring
your Readers to exercise their Patience and bear with my Humours now
and then because I shall trouble them but seldom I am not insensible
of the Impossibility of pleasing all but I would not willingly
displease any and for those who will take Offence where none is
intended they are beneath the Notice of

To the Author of the NewEngland Courant

SIR

Discoursing the other Day at Dinner with my Reverend Boarder formerly
mentiond whom for Distinction sake we will call by the Name of
Clericus concerning the Education of Children I askd his Advice
about my young Son William whether or no I had best bestow upon him
Academical Learning or as our Phrase is bring him up at our
College He perswaded me to do it by all Means using many weighty
Arguments with me and answering all the Objections that I could form
against it telling me withal that he did not doubt but that the Lad
would take his Learning very well and not idle away his Time as too
many there nowadays do These words of Clericus gave me a Curiosity
to inquire a little more strictly into the present Circumstances of that
famous Seminary of Learning but the Information which he gave me was
neither pleasant nor such as I expected

As soon as Dinner was over I took a solitary Walk into my Orchard
still ruminating on Clericuss Discourse with much Consideration
until I came to my usual Place of Retirement under the Great
AppleTree where having seated my self and carelessly laid my Head on
a verdant Bank I fell by Degrees into a soft and undisturbed Slumber
My waking Thoughts remained with me in my Sleep and before I awakd
again I dreamt the following DREAM

I fancyd I was travelling over pleasant and delightful Fields and
Meadows and thro many small Country Towns and Villages and as I
passd along all Places resounded with the Fame of the Temple of
LEARNING Every Peasant who had wherewithal was preparing to send one
of his Children at least to this famous Place and in this Case most of
them consulted their own Purses instead of their Childrens Capacities
So that I observed a great many yea the most part of those who were
travelling thither were little better than Dunces and Blockheads Alas
Alas

At length I entred upon a spacious Plain in the Midst of which was
erected a large and stately Edifice It was to this that a great Company
of Youths from all Parts of the Country were going so stepping in among
the Crowd I passed on with them and presently arrived at the Gate

The Passage was Kept by two sturdy Porters named Riches and
Poverty and the latter obstinately refused to give Entrance to any
who had not first gaind the Favour of the former so that I observed
many who came even to the very Gate were obliged to travel back again
as ignorant as they came for want of this necessary Qualification
However as a Spectator I gaind Admittance and with the rest entred
directly into the Temple

In the Middle of the great Hall stood a stately and magnificent Throne
which was ascended to by two high and difficult Steps On the Top of it
sat LEARNING in awful State she was apparelled wholly in Black and
surrounded almost on every Side with innumerable Volumes in all
Languages She seemd very busily employd in writing something on half
a Sheet of Paper and upon Enquiry I understood she was preparing a
Paper calld The NewEngland Courant On her Right Hand sat
English with a pleasant smiling Countenance and handsomely attird
and on her left were seated several Antique Figures with their Faces
vaild I was considerably puzzld to guess who they were until one
informed me who stood beside me that those Figures on her left Hand
were Latin Greek Hebrew c and that they were very much
reservd and seldom or never unvaild their Faces here and then to few
or none tho most of those who have in this Place acquird so much
Learning as to distinguish them from English pretended to an intimate
Acquaintance with them I then enquird of him what could be the Reason
why they continued vaild in this Place especially He pointed to the
Foot of the Throne where I saw Idleness attended with Ignorance
and these he informed me were they who first vaild them and still
kept them so

Now I observed that the whole Tribe who entred into the Temple with me
began to climb the Throne but the Work proving troublesome and
difficult to most of them they withdrew their Hands from the Plow and
contented themselves to sit at the Foot with Madam Idleness and her
Maid Ignorance until those who were assisted by Diligence and a
docible Temper had well nigh got up the first Step But the Time
drawing nigh in which they could no way avoid ascending they were fain
to crave the Assistance of those who had got up before them and who
for the Reward perhaps of a Pint of Milk or a Piece of PlumbCake
lent the Lubbers a helping Hand and sat them in the Eye of the World
upon a Level with themselves

The other Step being in the same Manner ascended and the usual
Ceremonies at an End every BeetleScull seemd well satisfyd with his
own Portion of Learning tho perhaps he was een just as ignorant as
ever And now the Time of their Departure being come they marchd out
of Doors to make Room for another Company who waited for Entrance And
I having seen all that was to be seen quitted the Hall likewise and
went to make my Observations on those who were just gone out before me

Some I perceivd took to Merchandizing others to Travelling some to
one Thing some to another and some to Nothing and many of them from
henceforth for want of Patrimony livd as poor as church Mice being
unable to dig and ashamd to beg and to live by their Wits it was
impossible But the most Part of the Crowd went along a large beaten
Path which led to a Temple at the further End of the Plain calld
The Temple of Theology The Business of those who were employd in
this Temple being laborious and painful I wonderd exceedingly to see
so many go towards it but while I was pondering this Matter in my Mind
I spyd Pecunia behind a Curtain beckoning to them with her Hand
which Sight immediately satisfyd me for whose Sake it was that a great
Part of them I will not say all traveld that Road In this Temple I
saw nothing worth mentioning except the ambitious and fraudulent
Contrivances of Plagius who notwithstanding he had been severely
reprehended for such Practices before was diligently transcribing some
eloquent Paragraphs out of Tillotsons Works c to embellish his
own

Now I bethought my self in my Sleep that it was Time to be at Home and
as I fancyd I was travelling back thither I reflected in my Mind on
the extream Folly of those Parents who blind to their Childrens
Dulness and insensible of the Solidity of their Skulls because they
think their Purses can afford it will needs send them to the Temple of
Learning where for want of a suitable Genius they learn little more
than how to carry themselves handsomely and enter a Room genteely
which might as well be acquird at a DancingSchool and from whence
they return after Abundance of Trouble and Charge as great Blockheads
as ever only more proud and selfconceited

While I was in the midst of these unpleasant Reflections Clericus
who with a Book in his Hand was walking under the Trees accidentally
awakd me to him I related my Dream with all its Particulars and he
without much Study presently interpreted it assuring me That it was
a lively Representation of HARVARD COLLEGE Etcetera

                                        Your Humble Servant

To the Author of the NewEngland Courant

SIR

I shall here present your Readers with a Letter from one who informs me
that I have begun at the wrong End of my Business and that I ought to
begin at Home and censure the Vices and Follies of my own Sex before I
venture to meddle with yours Nevertheless I am resolved to dedicate
this Speculation to the Fair Tribe and endeavour to show that Mr
Ephraim charges Women with being particularly guilty of Pride
Idleness c wrongfully inasmuch as the Men have not only as great a
Share in those Vices as the Women but are likewise in a great Measure
the Cause of that which the Women are guilty of I think it will be best
to produce my Antagonist before I encounter him

    To Mrs DOGOOD

    Madam

    My Design in troubling you with this Letter is to desire you
    would begin with your own Sex first Let the first Volley of
    your Resentments be directed against Female Vice let
    Female Idleness Ignorance and Folly which are Vices more
    peculiar to your Sex than to ours be the Subject of your
    Satyrs but more especially Female Pride which I think is
    intollerable Here is a large Field that wants Cultivation
    and which I believe you are able if willing to improve with
    Advantage and when you have once reformed the Women you
    will find it a much easier Task to reform the Men because
    Women are the prime Causes of a great many Male Enormities
    This is all at present from

                           Your Friendly Wellwisher
                                         Ephraim Censorious

After Thanks to my Correspondent for his Kindness in cutting out Work
for me I must assure him that I find it a very difficult Matter to
reprove Women separate from the Men for what Vice is there in which the
Men have not as great a Share as the Women and in some have they not a
far greater as in Drunkenness Swearing c And if they have then it
follows that when a Vice is to be reproved Men who are most culpable
deserve the most Reprehension and certainly therefore ought to have
it But we will wave this point at present and proceed to a particular
Consideration of what my Correspondent calls Female Vice

As for Idleness if I should Qure Where are the greatest Number of
its Votaries to be found with us or the Men it might I believe be
easily and truly answerd With the latter For notwithstanding the
Men are commonly complaining how hard they are forcd to labour only to
maintain their Wives in Pomp and Idleness yet if you go among the
Women you will learn that they have always more Work upon their Hands
than they are able to do and that a Womans Work is never done c
But however Suppose we should grant for once that we are generally
more idle than the Men without making any Allowance for the Weakness
of the Sex I desire to know whose Fault it is Are not the Men to
blame for their Folly in maintaining us in Idleness Who is there that
can be handsomely supported in Affluence Ease and Pleasure by another
that will chuse rather to earn his Bread by the Sweat of his own Brows
And if a Man will be so fond and so foolish as to labour hard himself
for a Livelihood and suffer his Wife in the mean Time to sit in Ease
and Idleness let him not blame her if she does so for it is in a great
Measure his own Fault

And now for the Ignorance and Folly which he reproaches us with let us
see if we are Fools and Ignoramuss whose is the Fault the Mens or
ours An ingenious Writer having this Subject in Hand has the
following Words wherein he lays the Fault wholly on the Men for not
allowing Women the Advantages of Education

    I have says he often thought of it as one of the most
    barbarous Customs in the World considering us as a civilizd
    and Christian Country that we deny the Advantages of
    Learning to Women We reproach the Sex every Day with Folly
    and Impertinence while I am confident had they the
    Advantages of Education equal to us they would be guilty of
    less than our selves One would wonder indeed how it should
    happen that Women are conversible at all since they are only
    beholding to natural Parts for all their Knowledge Their
    Youth is spent to teach them to stitch and sow or make
    Baubles They are taught to read indeed and perhaps to write
    their Names or so and that is the Heigth of a Womans
    Education And I would but ask any who slight the Sex for
    their Understanding What is a Man a Gentleman I mean good
    for that is taught no more If Knowledge and Understanding
    had been useless Additions to the Sex God Almighty would
    never have given them Capacities for he made nothing
    Needless What has the Woman done to forfeit the Priviledge
    of being taught Does she plague us with her Pride and
    Impertinence Why did we not let her learn that she might
    have had more Wit Shall we upraid Women with Folly when
    tis only the Error of this inhumane Custom that hindred them
    being made wiser

So much for Female Ignorance and Folly and now let us a little consider
the Pride which my Correspondent thinks is intolerable By this
Expression of his one would think he is some dejected Swain tyrannizd
over by some cruel haughty Nymph who perhaps he thinks has no more
Reason to be proud than himself Alasaday What shall we say in this
Case Why truly if Women are proud it is certainly owing to the Men
still for if they will be such Simpletons as to humble themselves at
their Feet and fill their credulous Ears with extravagant Praises of
their Wit Beauty and other Accomplishments perhaps where there are
none too and when Women are by this Means perswaded that they are
Something more than humane what Wonder is it if they carry themselves
haughtily and live extravagantly Notwithstanding I believe there are
more Instances of extravagant Pride to be found among Men than among
Women and this Fault is certainly more hainous in the former than in
the latter

Upon the whole I conclude that it will be impossible to lash any Vice
of which the Men are not equally guilty with the Women and
consequently deserve an equal if not a greater Share in the Censure
However I exhort both to amend where both are culpable otherwise they
may expect to be severely handled by

DOGOOD PAPERS NO VII

From Monday June  to Monday June  

    Give me the Muse whose generous Force
      Impatient of the Reins
    Pursues an unattempted Course
      Breaks all the Criticks Iron Chains
                                        WATTS

To the Author of the NewEngland Courant

SIR

It has been the Complaint of many Ingenious Foreigners who have
travelld amongst us That good Poetry is not to be expected in
NewEngland I am apt to Fancy the Reason is not because our
Countrymen are altogether void of a Poetical Genius nor yet because we
have not those Advantages of Education which other Countries have but
purely because we do not afford that Praise and Encouragement which is
merited when any thing extraordinary of this Kind is producd among us
Upon which Consideration I have determined when I meet with a Good
Piece of NewEngland Poetry to give it a suitable Encomium and
thereby endeavour to discover to the World some of its Beautys in order
to encourage the Author to go on and bless the World with more and
more Excellent Productions

There has lately appeard among us a most Excellent Piece of Poetry
entituled An Elegy upon the much Lamented Death of Mrs Mehitebell
Kitel Wife of Mr John Kitel of Salem Etc It may justly be said
in its Praise without Flattery to the Author that it is the most
Extraordinary Piece that was ever wrote in NewEngland The Language
is so soft and Easy the Expression so moving and pathetick but above
all the Verse and Numbers so Charming and Natural that it is almost
beyond Comparison

    The Muse disdainsF
    Those Links and Chains
    Measures and Rules of Vulgar Strains
    And oer the Laws of Harmony a Sovereign Queen she reigns

  F Watts Franklins note

I find no English Author Ancient or Modern whose Elegies may be
compard with this in respect to the Elegance of Stile or Smoothness
of Rhime and for the affecting Part I will leave your Readers to
judge if ever they read any Lines that would sooner make them draw
their Breath and Sigh if not shed Tears than these following

    Come let us mourn for we have lost a
      Wife a Daughter and a Sister
    Who has lately taken Flight and
      greatly we have mist her

In another place

    Some little Time before she yielded up her Breath
    She said I neer shall hear one Sermon more on Earth
    She kist her Husband some little Time before she expird
    Then leand her Head the Pillow on just out of Breath and tird

But the Threefold Appellation in the first Line

    a Wife a Daughter and a Sister

must not pass unobserved That Line in the celebrated Watts

    GUNSTON the Just the Generous and the Young

is nothing Comparable to it The latter only mentions three
Qualifications of one Person who was deceased which therefore could
raise Grief and Compassion but for One Whereas the former our most
excellent Poet gives his Reader a Sort of an Idea of the Death of
Three Persons viz

    a Wife a Daughter and a Sister

which is Three Times as great a Loss as the Death of One and
consequently must raise Three Times as much Grief and Compassion in
the Reader

I should be very much straitened for Room if I should attempt to
discover even half the Excellencies of this Elegy which are obvious to
me Yet I cannot omit one Observation which is that the Author has to
his Honour invented a new Species of Poetry which wants a Name and
was never before known His muse scorns to be confind to the old
Measures and Limits or to observe the dull Rules of Criticks

    Nor Rapin gives her Rules to fly nor Purcell Notes to Sing
                                                                WATTS

Now tis Pity that such an Excellent Piece should not be dignifyd with
a particular Name and seeing it cannot justly be called either Epic
Sapphic Lyric or Pindaric nor any other Name yet invented I
presume it may in Honour and Remembrance of the Dead be called the
KITELIC Thus much in the Praise of Kitelic Poetry

It is certain that those Elegies which are of our own Growth and our
Soil seldom produces any other sort of Poetry are by far the greatest
part wretchedly Dull and Ridiculous Now since it is imagind by many
that our Poets are honest wellmeaning Fellows who do their best and
that if they had but some Instructions how to govern Fancy with
Judgment they would make indifferent good Elegies I shall here subjoin
a Receipt for that purpose which was left me as a Legacy among other
valuable Rarities by my Reverend Husband It is as follows

    A RECEIPT to make a NewEngland Funeral ELEGY

    For the Title of your Elegy Of these you may have enough
    ready made to your Hands but if you should chuse to make it
    your self you must be sure not to omit the words tatis
    Su which will Beautify it exceedingly

    For the Subject of your Elegy Take one of your Neighbours
    who has lately departed this Life it is no great matter at
    what Age the Party dyd but it will be best if he went away
    suddenly being Killd Drownd or Frose to Death

    Having chose the Person take all his Virtues Excellencies
    c and if he have not enough you may borrow some to make up
    a sufficient Quantity To these add his last Words dying
    Expressions c if they are to be had mix all these
    together and be sure you strain them well Then season all
    with a Handful or two of Melancholly Expressions such as
    Dreadful Deadly cruel cold Death unhappy Fate weeping
    Eyes c Have mixed all these Ingredients well put them
    into the empty Scull of some young Harvard but in Case
    you have neer a One at Hand you may use your own there
    let them Ferment for the Space of a Fortnight and by that
    Time they will be incorporated into a Body which take out
    and having prepared a sufficient Quantity of double Rhimes
    such as Power Flower Quiver Shiver Grieve us Leave us
    tell you excel you Expeditions Physicians Fatigue him
    Intrigue him c you must spread all upon Paper and if you
    can procure a Scrap of Latin to put at the End it will
    garnish it mightily then having affixed your Name at the
    Bottom with a Mstus Composuit you will have an
    Excellent Elegy

    of your Elegy provided you borrow a greater Quantity of
    Virtues Excellencies c

    Quod est in corde sobrii est in ore ebrii

To the Author of the NewEngland Courant

SIR

It is no unprofitable tho unpleasant Pursuit diligently to inspect and
consider the Manners  Conversation of Men who insensible of the
greatest Enjoyments of humane Life abandon themselves to Vice from a
false Notion of Pleasure and good Fellowship A true and natural
Representation of any Enormity is often the best Argument against it
and Means of removing it when the most severe Reprehensions alone are
found ineffectual

I would in this Letter improve the little Observation I have made on the
Vice of Drunkeness the better to reclaim the good Fellows who
usually pay the Devotions of the Evening to Bacchus

I doubt not but moderate Drinking has been improvd for the Diffusion
of Knowledge among the ingenious Part of Mankind who want the Talent of
a ready Utterance in order to discover the Conceptions of their Minds
in an entertaining and intelligible Manner Tis true drinking does not
improve our Faculties but it enables us to use them and therefore I
conclude that much Study and Experience and a little Liquor are of
absolute Necessity for some Tempers in order to make them accomplishd
Orators Dic Ponder discovers an excellent Judgment when he is
inspird with a Glass or two of Claret but he passes for a Fool among
those of small Observation who never saw him the better for Drink And
here it will not be improper to observe That the moderate Use of
Liquor and a well placd and well regulated Anger often produce this
same Effect and some who cannot ordinarily talk but in broken Sentences
and false Grammar do in the Heat of Passion express themselves with as
much Eloquence as Warmth Hence it is that my own Sex are generally the
most eloquent because the most passionate It has been said in the
Praise of some Men says an ingenious Author that they could talk
whole Hours together upon any thing but it must be owned to the Honour
of the other Sex that there are many among them who can talk whole
Hours together upon Nothing I have known a Woman branch out into a long
extempore Dissertation on the Edging of a Petticoat and chide her
Servant for breaking a China Cup in all the Figures of Rhetorick

But after all it must be considerd that no Pleasure can give
Satisfaction or prove advantageous to a reasonable Mind which is not
attended with the Restraints of Reason Enjoyment is not to be found
by Excess in any sensual Gratification but on the contrary the
immoderate Cravings of the Voluptuary are always succeeded with
Loathing and a palled Apetite What Pleasure can the Drunkard have in
the Reflection that while in his Cups he retaind only the Shape of a
Man and acted the Part of a Beast or that from reasonable Discourse a
few Minutes before he descended to Impertinence and Nonsense

I cannot pretend to account for the different Effects of Liquor on
Persons of different Dispositions who are guilty of Excess in the Use
of it Tis strange to see Men of a regular Conversation become rakish
and profane when intoxicated with Drink and yet more surprizing to
observe that some who appear to be the most profligate Wretches when
sober become mighty religious in their Cups and will then and at no
other Time address their Maker but when they are destitute of Reason
and actually affronting him Some shrink in the Wetting and others
swell to such an unusual Bulk in their Imaginations that they can in an
Instant understand all Arts and Sciences by the liberal Education of a
little vivyfying Punch or a sufficient Quantity of other exhilerating
Liquor

And as the Effects of Liquor are various so are the Characters given to
its Devourers It argues some Shame in the Drunkards themselves in that
they have invented numberless Words and Phrases to cover their Folly
whose proper Significations are harmless or have no Signification at
all They are seldom known to be drunk tho they are very often
boozey cogey tipsey foxd merry mellow fuddld
groatable Confoundedly cut See two Moons are Among the
Philistines In a very good Humour See the Sun or The Sun has
shone upon them they Clip the Kings English are Almost froze
Feavourish In their Altitudes Pretty well enterd c In
short every Day produces some new Word or Phrase which might be added
to the Vocabulary of the Tiplers But I have chose to mention these
few because if at any Time a Man of Sobriety and Temperance happens to
cut himself confoundedly or is almoss froze or feavourish or
accidentally sees the Sun c he may escape the Imputation of being
drunk when his Misfortune comes to be related

EDITORIAL PREFACE TO THE NEW ENGLAND COURANT

From Monday February  to Monday February  

The late Publisher of this Paper finding so many Inconveniences
would arise by his carrying the Manuscripts and publick News to be
supervisd by the Secretary as to render his carrying it on
unprofitable has intirely dropt the Undertaking The present Publisher
having receivd the following Piece desires the Readers to accept of it
as a Preface to what they may hereafter meet with in this Paper

    Non ego mordaci distrinxi Carmine quenquam
    Nulla vonenato Litera onista Joco est

Long has the Press groaned in bringing forth an hateful but numerous
Brood of Party Pamphlets malicious Scribbles and Billinsgate Ribaldry
The Rancour and bitterness it has unhappily infused into Mens minds
and to what a Degree it has sowred and leavend the Tempers of Persons
formerly esteemed some of the most sweet and affable is too well known
here to need any further Proof or Representation of the Matter

No generous and impartial Person then can blame the present Undertaking
which is designed purely for the Diversion and Merriment of the Reader
Pieces of Pleasancy and Mirth have a secret Charm in them to allay the
Heats and Tumours of our Spirits and to make a Man forget his restless
Resentments They have a strange Power to tune the harsh Disorders of
the Soul and reduce us to a serene and placid State of Mind

The main Design of this Weekly Paper will be to entertain the Town with
the most comical and diverting Incidents of Humane Life which in so
large a Place as Boston will not fail of a universal Exemplification
Nor shall we be wanting to fill up these Papers with a grateful
Interspersion of more serious Morals which may be drawn from the most
ludicrous and odd Parts of Life

As for the Author that is the next Question But tho we profess
ourselves ready to oblige the ingenious and courteous Reader with most
Sorts of Intelligence yet here we beg a Reserve Nor will it be of any
Manner of Advantage either to them or to the Writers that their names
should be published and therefore in this Matter we desire the Favour
of you to suffer us to hold our Tongues Which tho at this Time of Day
it may sound like a very uncommon Request yet it proceeds from the very
Hearts of your Humble Servants

By this Time the Reader perceives that more than one are engaged in the
present Undertaking Yet is there one Person an Inhabitant of this Town
of Boston whom we honour as a Doctor in the Chair or a perpetual
Dictator

The Society had designd to present the Publick with his Effigies but
that the Limner to whom he was presented for a Draught of his
Countenance descryed and this he is ready to offer upon Oath Nineteen
Features in his Face more than ever he beheld in any Humane Visage
before which so raised the Price of his Picture that our Master
himself forbid the Extravagance of coming up to it And then besides
the Limner objected a Schism in his face which splits it from his
Forehead in a strait Line down to his chin in such sort that Mr
Painter protests it is a double Face and hell have Four Pounds for
the Pourtraiture However tho this double Face has spoilt us of a
pretty Picture yet we all rejoiced to see old Janus in our Company

There is no Man in Boston better qualified than old Janus for a
Couranteer or if you please an Observator being a Man of such
remarkable Opticks as to look two ways at once

As for his Morals he is a chearly Christian as the Country Phrase
expresses it A Man of good Temper courteous Deportment sound
Judgment a mortal Hater of Nonsense Foppery Formality and endless
Ceremony

As for his club they aim at no greater Happiness or Honour than the
Publick be made to know that it is the utmost of their Ambition to
attend upon and do all imaginable good Offices to good old Janus the
Couranteer who is and always will be the Readers humble Servant

PS Gentle Readers we design never to let a Paper pass without a Latin
Motto if we can possibly pick one up which carries a Charm in it to the
Vulgar and the learned admire the pleasure of Construing We should
have obliged the World with a Greek scrap or two but the Printer has no
Types and therefore we intreat the candid Reader not to impute the
defect to our Ignorance for our Doctor can say all the Greek Letters
by heart



A DISSERTATION ON LIBERTY AND NECESSITY PLEASURE AND PAIN

To Mr J R

London 

SIR

I have here according to your Request given you my present Thoughts
of the general State of Things in the Universe Such as they are you
have them and are welcome to em and if they yield you any Pleasure or
Satisfaction I shall think my Trouble sufficiently compensated I know
my Scheme will be liable to many Objections from a less discerning
Reader than your self but it is not designd for those who cant
understand it I need not give you any Caution to distinguish the
hypothetical Parts of the Argument from the conclusive You will easily
perceive what I design for Demonstration and what for Probability only
The whole I leave entirely to you and shall value my self more or less
on this account in proportion to your Esteem and Approbation

                                   

Sect I Of Liberty and Necessity

I There is said to be a First Mover who is called GOD Maker of
the Universe

II He is said to be allwise allgood all powerful

These two Propositions being allowd and asserted by People of almost
every Sect and Opinion I have here supposd them granted and laid them
down as the Foundation of my Argument What follows then being a Chain
of Consequences truly drawn from them will stand or fall as they are
true or false

III If He is allgood whatsoever He doth must be good

IV If He is allwise whatsoever He doth must be wise

The Truth of these Propositions with relation to the two first I think
may be justly calld evident since either that infinite Goodness will
act what is ill or infinite Wisdom what is not wise is too glaring a
Contradiction not to be perceivd by any Man of common Sense and
denyd as soon as understood

V If He is allpowerful there can be nothing either existing or
acting in the Universe against or without his Consent and what He
consents to must be good because He is good therefore Evil doth not
exist

Unde Malum has been long a Question and many of the Learned have
perplexd themselves and Readers to little Purpose in Answer to it That
there are both Things and Actions to which we give the Name of Evil
is not here denyd as Pain Sickness Want Theft Murder
c but that these and the like are not in reality Evils Ills or
Defects in the Order of the Universe is demonstrated in the next
Section as well as by this and the following Proposition Indeed to
suppose any Thing to exist or be done contrary to the Will of the
Almighty is to suppose him not almighty or that Something the Cause
of Evil is more mighty than the Almighty an Inconsistence that I
think no One will defend And to deny any Thing or Action which he
consents to the existence of to be good is entirely to destroy his two
Attributes of Wisdom and Goodness

There is nothing done in the Universe say the Philosophers but what
God either does or permits to be done This as He is Almighty is
certainly true But what need of this Distinction between doing and
permitting Why first they take it for granted that many Things in
the Universe exist in such a Manner as is not for the best and that
many Actions are done which ought not to be done or would be better
undone these Things or Actions they cannot ascribe to God as His
because they have already attributed to Him infinite Wisdom and
Goodness Here then is the Use of the Word Permit He permits them
to be done say they But we will reason thus If God permits an
Action to be done it is because he wants either Power or
Inclination to hinder it in saying he wants Power we deny Him to
be almighty and if we say He wants Inclination or Will it must
be either because He is not Good or the Action is not evil for all
Evil is contrary to the Essence of Infinite Goodness The former is
inconsistent with his beforegiven Attribute of Goodness therefore the
latter must be true

It will be said perhaps that God permits evil Actions to be done
for wise Ends and Purposes But this Objection destroys itself for
whatever an infinitely good God hath wise Ends in suffering to be
must be good is thereby made good and cannot be otherwise

VI If a Creature is made by God it must depend upon God and receive
all its Power from Him with which Power the Creature can do nothing
contrary to the Will of God because God is Almighty what is not
contrary to His Will must be agreeable to it what is agreeable to it
must be good because He is Good therefore a Creature can do nothing
but what is good

This Proposition is much to the same Purpose with the former but more
particular and its Conclusion is as just and evident Tho a Creature
may do many Actions which by his Fellow Creatures will be namd Evil
and which will naturally and necessarily cause or bring upon the Doer
certain Pains which will likewise be calld Punishments yet this
Proposition proves that he cannot act what will be in itself really
Ill or displeasing to God And that the painful Consequences of his
evil Actions so calld are not as indeed they ought not to be
Punishments or Unhappinesses will be shewn hereafter

Nevertheless the late learned Author of The Religion of Nature
which I send you herewith has given us a Rule or Scheme whereby to
discover which of our Actions ought to be esteemd and denominated
good and which evil It is in short this Every Action which is
done according to Truth is good and every Action contrary to Truth
is evil To act according to Truth is to use and esteem every Thing as
what it is c Thus if A steals a Horse from B and rides away upon
him he uses him not as what he is in Truth viz the Property of
another but as his own which is contrary to Truth and therefore
evil But as this Gentleman himself says Sect I Prop VI In
order to judge rightly what any Thing is it must be considerd not
only what it is in one Respect but also what it may be in any other
Respect and the whole Description of the Thing ought to be taken in So
in this Case it ought to be considerd that A is naturally a
covetous Being feeling an Uneasiness in the want of Bs Horse
which produces an Inclination for stealing him stronger than his Fear
of Punishment for so doing This is Truth likewise and A acts
according to it when he steals the Horse Besides if it is provd to be
a Truth that A has not Power over his own Actions it will be
indisputable that he acts according to Truth and impossible he should
do otherwise

I would not be understood by this to encourage or defend Theft tis
only for the sake of the Argument and will certainly have no ill
Effect The Order and Course of Things will not be affected by
Reasoning of this Kind and tis as just and necessary and as much
according to Truth for B to dislike and punish the Theft of his
Horse as it is for A to steal him

VII If the Creature is thus limited in his Actions being able to do
only such Things as God would have him to do and not being able to
refuse doing what God would have done then he can have no such Thing as
Liberty Freewill or Power to do or refrain an Action

By Liberty is sometimes understood the Absence of Opposition and in
this Sense indeed all our Actions may be said to be the Effects of our
Liberty But it is a Liberty of the same Nature with the Fall of a heavy
Body to the Ground it has Liberty to fall that is it meets with
nothing to hinder its Fall but at the same Time it is necessitated to
fall and has no Power or Liberty to remain suspended

But let us take the Argument in another View and suppose ourselves to
be in the common sense of the Word Free Agents As Man is a Part of
this great Machine the Universe his regular Acting is requisite to the
regular moving of the whole Among the many Things which lie before him
to be done he may as he is at Liberty and his Choice influencd by
nothing for so it must be or he is not at Liberty chuse any one and
refuse the rest Now there is every Moment something best to be done
which is alone then good and with respect to which every Thing else
is at that Time evil In order to know which is best to be done and
which not it is requisite that we should have at one View all the
intricate Consequences of every Action with respect to the general Order
and Scheme of the Universe both present and future but they are
innumerable and incomprehensible by any Thing but Omniscience As we
cannot know these we have but as one Chance to ten thousand to hit on
the right Action we should then be perpetually blundering about in the
Dark and putting the Scheme in Disorder for every wrong Action of a
Part is a Defect or Blemish in the Order of the Whole Is it not
necessary then that our Actions should be overruld and governd by an
allwise ProvidenceHow exact and regular is every Thing in the
natural World How wisely in every Part contrivd We cannot here find
the least Defect Those who have studyd the mere animal and vegetable
Creation demonstrate that nothing can be more harmonious and beautiful
All the heavenly Bodies the Stars and Planets are regulated with the
utmost Wisdom And can we suppose less Care to be taken in the Order of
the moral than in the natural System It is as if an ingenious
Artificer having framd a curious Machine or Clock and put its many
intricate Wheels and Powers in such a Dependance on one another that
the whole might move in the most exact Order and Regularity had
nevertheless placd in it several other Wheels endud with an
independent SelfMotion but ignorant of the general Interest of the
Clock and these would every now and then be moving wrong disordering
the true Movement and making continual Work for the Mender which might
better be prevented by depriving them of that Power of SelfMotion and
placing them in a Dependance on the regular Part of the Clock

VIII If there is no such Thing as FreeWill in Creatures there can be
neither Merit nor Demerit in Creatures

IX And therefore every Creature must be equally esteemd by the
Creator

These Propositions appear to be the necessary Consequences of the
former And certainly no Reason can be given why the Creator should
prefer in his Esteem one Part of His Works to another if with equal
Wisdom and Goodness he designd and created them all since all Ill or
Defect as contrary to his Nature is excluded by his Power We will sum
up the Argument thus When the Creator first designd the Universe
either it was His Will and Intention that all Things should exist and
be in the Manner they are at this Time or it was his Will they should
be otherwise ie in a different Manner To say it was His Will
Things should be otherwise than they are is to say Somewhat hath
contradicted His Will and broken His Measures which is impossible
because inconsistent with his Power therefore we must allow that all
Things exist now in a Manner agreeable to His Will and in consequence
of that are all equally Good and therefore equally esteemd by Him

I proceed now to shew that as all the Works of the Creator are equally
esteemd by Him so they are as in Justice they ought to be equally
usd

                                   

Sect II Of Pleasure and Pain

I When a Creature is formd and endud with Life tis supposd to
receive a Capacity of the Sensation of Uneasiness or Pain

It is this distinguishes Life and Consciousness from unactive
unconscious Matter To know or be sensible of Suffering or being acted
upon is to live and whatsoever is not so among created Things is
properly and truly dead

All Pain and Uneasiness proceeds at first from and is causd by
Somewhat without and distinct from the Mind itself The Soul must first
be acted upon before it can react In the Beginning of Infancy it is as
if it were not it is not conscious of its own Existence till it has
receivd the first Sensation of Pain then and not before it begins
to feel itself is rousd and put into Action then it discovers its
Powers and Faculties and exerts them to expel the Uneasiness Thus is
the Machine set on work this is Life We are first movd by Pain and
the whole succeeding Course of our Lives is but one continud Series of
Action with a View to be freed from it As fast as we have excluded one
Uneasiness another appears otherwise the Motion would cease If a
continual Weight is not applyd the Clock will stop And as soon as the
Avenues of Uneasiness to the Soul are choakd up or cut off we are
dead we think and act no more

II This Uneasiness whenever felt produces Desire to be freed from
it great in exact proportion to the Uneasiness

Thus is Uneasiness the first Spring and Cause of all Action for till
we are uneasy in Rest we can have no Desire to move and without Desire
of moving there can be no voluntary Motion The Experience of every Man
who has observd his own Actions will evince the Truth of this and I
think nothing need be said to prove that the Desire will be equal to
the Uneasiness for the very Thing implies as much It is not
Uneasiness unless we desire to be freed from it nor a great
Uneasiness unless the consequent Desire is great

I might here observe how necessary a Thing in the Order and Design of
the Universe this Pain or Uneasiness is and how beautiful in its
Place Let us but suppose it just now banishd the World entirely and
consider the Consequence of it All the Animal Creation would
immediately stand stock still exactly in the Posture they were in the
Moment Uneasiness departed not a Limb not a Finger would henceforth
move we should all be reducd to the Condition of Statues dull and
unactive Here I should continue to sit motionless with the Pen in my
Hand thusand neither leave my Seat nor write one Letter more This
may appear odd at first View but a little Consideration will make it
evident for tis impossible to assign any other Cause for the voluntary
Motion of an Animal than its uneasiness in Rest What a different
Appearance then would the Face of Nature make without it How necessary
is it And how unlikely that the Inhabitants of the World ever were or
that the Creator ever designd they should be exempt from it

I would likewise observe here that the VIIIth Proposition in the
preceding Section viz That there is neither Merit nor Demerit c
is here again demonstrated as infallibly tho in another manner For
since Freedom from Uneasiness is the End of all our Actions how is it
possible for us to do any Thing disinterestedHow can any Action be
meritorious of Praise or Dispraise Reward or Punishment when the
natural Principle of SelfLove is the only and the irresistible Motive
to it

III This Desire is always fulfilld or satisfyd

In the Design or End of it tho not in the Manner The first is
requisite the latter not To exemplify this let us make a Supposition
A Person is confind in a House which appears to be in imminent Danger
of Falling this as soon as perceivd creates a violent Uneasiness
and that instantly produces an equal strong Desire the End of which
is freedom from the Uneasiness and the Manner or Way proposd to
gain this End is to get out of the House Now if he is convincd by
any Means that he is mistaken and the House is not likely to fall he
is immediately freed from his Uneasiness and the End of his Desire
is attaind as well as if it had been in the Manner desird viz
leaving the House

All our different Desires and Passions proceed from and are reducible to
this one Point Uneasiness tho the Means we propose to ourselves for
expelling of it are infinite One proposes Fame another Wealth a
third Power c as the Means to gain this End but tho these are
never attaind if the Uneasiness be removd by some other Means the
Desire is satisfyd Now during the Course of Life we are ourselves
continually removing successive Uneasinesses as they arise and the
last we suffer is removd by the sweet Sleep of Death

IV The fulfilling or Satisfaction of this Desire produces the
Sensation of Pleasure great or small in exact proportion to the
Desire

Pleasure is that Satisfaction which arises in the Mind upon and is
causd by the accomplishment of our Desires and by no other Means at
all and those Desires being above shewn to be causd by our Pains or
Uneasinesses it follows that Pleasure is wholly causd by Pain
and by no other Thing at all

V Therefore the Sensation of Pleasure is equal or in exact
proportion to the Sensation of Pain

As the Desire of being freed from Uneasiness is equal to the
Uneasiness and the Pleasure of satisfying that Desire equal to the
Desire the Pleasure thereby producd must necessarily be equal to
the Uneasiness or Pain which produces it of three Lines A B
and C if A is equal to B and B to C C must be equal to
A And as our Uneasinesses are always removd by some Means or
other it follows that Pleasure and Pain are in their Nature
inseparable So many Degrees as one Scale of the Ballance descends so
many exactly the other ascends and one cannot rise or fall without the
Fall or Rise of the other Tis impossible to taste of Pleasure
without feeling its preceding proportionate Pain or to be sensible of
Pain without having its necessary Consequent Pleasure The highest
Pleasure is only Consciousness of Freedom from the deepest Pain and
Pain is not Pain to us unless we ourselves are sensible of it They go
Hand in Hand they cannot be divided

You have a View of the whole Argument in a few familiar Examples The
Pain of Abstinence from Food as it is greater or less produces a
greater or less Desire of Eating the Accomplishment of this Desire
produces a greater or less Pleasure proportionate to it The Pain of
Confinement causes the Desire of Liberty which accomplishd yields a
Pleasure equal to that Pain of Confinement The Pain of Labour and
Fatigue causes the Pleasure of Rest equal to that Pain The Pain
of Absence from Friends produces the Pleasure of Meeting in exact
proportion c

This is the fixt Nature of Pleasure and Pain and will always be found
to be so by those who examine it

One of the most common Arguments for the future Existence of the Soul
is taken from the generally supposd Inequality of Pain and Pleasure in
the present and this notwithstanding the Difficulty by outward
Appearances to make a Judgment of anothers Happiness has been lookd
upon as almost unanswerable but since Pain naturally and infallibly
produces a Pleasure in proportion to it every individual Creature
must in any State of Life have an equal Quantity of each so that
there is not on that Account any Occasion for a future Adjustment

Thus are all the Works of the Creator equally usd by him And no
Condition of Life or Being is in itself better or preferable to another
The Monarch is not more happy than the Slave nor the Beggar more
miserable than Crsus Suppose A B and C three distinct
Beings A and B animate capable of Pleasure and Pain C an
inanimate Piece of Matter insensible of either A receives ten
Degrees of Pain which are necessarily succeeded by ten Degrees of
Pleasure B receives fifteen of Pain and the consequent equal
Number of Pleasure C all the while lies unconcernd and as he has
not sufferd the former has no right to the latter What can be more
equal and just than this When the Accounts come to be adjusted A has
no Reason to complain that his Portion of Pleasure was five Degrees
less than that of B for his Portion of Pain was five Degrees less
likewise Nor has B any Reason to boast that his Pleasure was five
Degrees greater than that of A for his Pain was proportionate They
are then both on the same Foot with C that is they are neither
Gainers nor Losers

It will possibly be objected here that even common Experience shews us
there is not in Fact this Equality Some we see hearty brisk and
chearful perpetually while others are constantly burdend with a heavy
Load of Maladies and Misfortunes remaining for Years perhaps in
Poverty Disgrace or Pain and die at last without any Appearance of
Recompence Now tho tis not necessary when a Proposition is
demonstrated to be a general Truth to shew in what manner it agrees
with the particular Circumstances of Persons and indeed ought not to be
requird yet as this is a common Objection some Notice may be taken
of it And here let it be observd that we cannot be proper Judges of
the good or bad Fortune of Others we are apt to imagine that what
would give us a great Uneasiness or a great Satisfaction has the same
Effect upon others we think for Instance those unhappy who must
depend upon Charity for a mean Subsistence who go in Rags fare hardly
and are despisd and scornd by all not considering that Custom renders
all these Things easy familiar and even pleasant When we see Riches
Grandeur and a chearful Countenance we easily imagine Happiness
accompanies them when oftentimes tis quite otherwise Nor is a
constantly sorrowful Look attended with continual Complaints an
infallible Indication of Unhappiness In short we can judge by nothing
but Appearances and they are very apt to deceive us Some put on a gay
chearful Outside and appear to the World perfectly at Ease tho even
then some inward Sting some secret Pain imbitters all their Joys and
makes the Ballance even Others appear continually dejected and full of
Sorrow but even Grief itself is sometimes pleasant and Tears are not
always without their Sweetness Besides Some take a Satisfaction in
being thought unhappy as others take a Pride in being thought humble
these will paint their Misfortunes to others in the strongest Colours
and leave no Means unusd to make you think them throughly miserable so
great a Pleasure it is to them to be pitied Others retain the Form
and outside Shew of Sorrow long after the Thing itself with its Cause
is removd from the Mind it is a Habit they have acquird and cannot
leave These with many others that might be given are Reasons why we
cannot make a true Estimate of the Equality of the Happiness and
Unhappiness of others and unless we could Matter of Fact cannot be
opposed to this Hypothesis Indeed we are sometimes apt to think that
the Uneasinesses we ourselves have had outweigh our Pleasures but the
Reason is this the Mind takes no Account of the latter they flip away
unremarkd when the former leave more lasting Impressions on the
Memory But suppose we pass the greatest part of Life in Pain and
Sorrow suppose we die by Torments and think no more tis no
Diminution to the Truth of what is here advancd for the Pain tho
exquisite is not so to the last Moments of Life the Senses are soon
benummd and renderd incapable of transmitting it so sharply to the
Soul as at first She perceives it cannot hold long and tis an
exquisite Pleasure to behold the immediate Approaches of Rest This
makes an Equivalent tho Annihilation should follow For the Quantity of
Pleasure and Pain is not to be measurd by its Duration any more
than the Quantity of Matter by its Extension and as one cubic Inch may
be made to contain by Condensation as much Matter as would fill ten
thousand cubic Feet being more expanded so one single Moment of
Pleasure may outweigh and compensate an Age of Pain

It was owing to their Ignorance of the Nature of Pleasure and Pain that
the Antient Heathens believd the idle Fable of their Elizium that
State of uninterrupted Ease and Happiness The Thing is intirely
impossible in Nature Are not the Pleasures of the Spring made such by
the Disagreeableness of the Winter Is not the Pleasure of fair Weather
owing to the Unpleasantness of foul Certainly Were it then always
Spring were the Fields always green and nourishing and the Weather
constantly serene and fair the Pleasure would pall and die upon our
Hands it would cease to be Pleasure to us when it is not usherd in by
Uneasiness Could the Philosopher visit in reality every Star and
Planet with as much Ease and Swiftness as he can now visit their Ideas
and pass from one to another of them in the Imagination it would be a
Pleasure I grant but it would be only in proportion to the Desire
of accomplishing it and that would be no greater than the Uneasiness
sufferd in the Want of it The Accomplishment of a long and difficult
Journey yields a great Pleasure but if we could take a Trip to the
Moon and back again as frequently and with as much Ease as we can go
and come from Market the Satisfaction would be just the same

The Immateriality of the Soul has been frequently made use of as an
Argument for its Immortality but let us consider that tho it should
be allowd to be immaterial and consequently its Parts incapable of
Separation or Destruction by any Thing material yet by Experience we
find that it is not incapable of Cessation of Thought which is its
Action When the Body is but a little indisposd it has an evident
Effect upon the Mind and a right Disposition of the Organs is requisite
to a right Manner of Thinking In a sound Sleep sometimes or in a
Swoon we cease to think at all tho the Soul is not therefore then
annihilated but exists all the while tho it does not act and may
not this probably be the Case after Death All our Ideas are first
admitted by the Senses and imprinted on the Brain increasing in Number
by Observation and Experience there they become the Subjects of the
Souls Action The Soul is a mere Power or Faculty of contemplating
on and comparing those Ideas when it has them hence springs Reason
But as it can think on nothing but Ideas it must have them before it
can think at all Therefore as it may exist before it has receivd any
Ideas it may exist before it thinks To remember a Thing is to have
the Idea of it still plainly imprinted on the Brain which the Soul can
turn to and contemplate on Occasion To forget a Thing is to have the
Idea of it defacd and destroyd by some Accident or the crouding in
and imprinting of great variety of other Ideas upon it so that the Soul
cannot find out its Traces and distinguish it When we have thus lost
the Idea of any one Thing we can think no more or cease to think
on that Thing and as we can lose the Idea of one Thing so we may of
ten twenty a hundred c and even of all Things because they are not
in their Nature permanent and often during Life we see that some Men
by an Accident or Distemper affecting the Brain lose the greatest
Part of their Ideas and remember very little of their past Actions and
Circumstances Now upon Death and the Destruction of the Body the
Ideas containd in the Brain which are alone the Subjects of the
Souls Action being then likewise necessarily destroyd the Soul tho
incapable of Destruction itself must then necessarily cease to think
or act having nothing left to think or act upon It is reducd to its
first unconscious State before it receivd any Ideas And to cease to
think is but little different from ceasing to be

Nevertheless tis not impossible that this same Faculty of
contemplating Ideas may be hereafter united to a new Body and receive a
new Set of Ideas but that will no way concern us who are now living
for the Identity will be lost it is no longer that same Self but a
new Being

I shall here subjoin a short Recapitulation of the Whole that it may
with all its Parts be comprehended at one View

 It is supposd that God the Maker and Governour of the Universe is
infinitely wise good and powerful

 In consequence of His Infinite Wisdom and Goodness it is asserted
that whatever He doth must be infinitely wise and good

 Unless He be interrupted and His Measures broken by some other
Being which is impossible because He is Almighty

 In consequence of His infinite Power it is asserted that nothing
can exist or be done in the Universe which is not agreeable to His Will
and therefore good

 Evil is hereby excluded with all Merit and Demerit and likewise
all preference in the Esteem of God of one Part of the Creation to
another This is the Summary of the first Part

Now our common Notions of Justice will tell us that if all created
Things are equally esteemd by the Creator they ought to be equally
usd by Him and that they are therefore equally usd we might embrace
for Truth upon the Credit and as the true Consequence of the foregoing
Argument Nevertheless we proceed to confirm it by shewing how they
are equally usd and that in the following Manner

 A Creature when endud with Life or Consciousness is made capable
of Uneasiness or Pain

 This Pain produces Desire to be freed from it in exact proportion
to itself

 The Accomplishment of this Desire produces an equal Pleasure

 Pleasure is consequently equal to Pain

From these Propositions it is observd

 That every Creature hath as much Pleasure as Pain

 That Life is not preferable to Insensibility for Pleasure and Pain
destroy one another That Being which has ten Degrees of Pain subtracted
from ten of Pleasure has nothing remaining and is upon an equality
with that Being which is insensible of both

 As the first Part proves that all Things must be equally usd by the
Creator because equally esteemd so this second Part demonstrates that
they are equally esteemd because equally usd

 Since every Action is the Effect of SelfUneasiness the Distinction
of Virtue and Vice is excluded and Prop VIII in Sect I again
demonstrated

 No State of Life can be happier than the present because Pleasure
and Pain are inseparable

Thus both Parts of this Argument agree with and confirm one another and
the Demonstration is reciprocal

I am sensible that the Doctrine here advancd if it were to be
publishd would meet with but an indifferent Reception Mankind
naturally and generally love to be flatterd Whatever sooths our Pride
and tends to exalt our Species above the rest of the Creation we are
pleasd with and easily believe when ungrateful Truths shall be with
the utmost Indignation rejected What bring ourselves down to an
Equality with the Beasts of the Field with the meanest part of the
Creation Tis insufferable But to use a Piece of common Sense
our Geese are but Geese tho we may think em Swans and Truth
will be Truth tho it sometimes prove mortifying and distasteful

ARTICLES OF BELIEF AND ACTS OF RELIGION

IN TWO PARTS

    Here will I hold If there is a Powr above us
    And that there is all Nature cries aloud
    Thro all her Works He must delight in Virtue
    And that which he delights in must be Happy
                                                CATO

PART I

Philada NOV  

FIRST PRINCIPLES

I believe there is one supreme most perfect Being Author and Father of
the Gods themselves For I believe that Man is not the most perfect
Being but one rather that as there are many Degrees of Beings his
Inferiors so there are many Degrees of Beings superior to him

Also when I stretch my Imagination thro and beyond our System of
Planets beyond the visible fixd Stars themselves into that Space that
is every Way infinite and conceive it filld with Suns like ours each
with a Chorus of Worlds forever moving round him then this little Ball
on which we move seems even in my narrow Imagination to be almost
Nothing and myself less than nothing and of no sort of Consequence

When I think thus I imagine it great Vanity in me to suppose that the
Supremely Perfect does in the least regard such an inconsiderable
Nothing as Man More especially since it is impossible for me to have
any positive clear idea of that which is infinite and incomprehensible
I cannot conceive otherwise than that he the Infinite Father expects
or requires no Worship or Praise from us but that he is even infinitely
above it

But since there is in all Men something like a natural principle which
inclines them to DEVOTION or the Worship of some unseen Power

And since Men are endued with Reason superior to all other Animals that
we are in our World acquainted with

Therefore I think it seems required of me and my Duty as a Man to pay
Divine Regards to SOMETHING

I conceive then that the INFINITE has created many beings or Gods
vastly superior to Man who can better conceive his Perfections than we
and return him a more rational and glorious Praise

As among Men the Praise of the Ignorant or of Children is not regarded
by the ingenious Painter or Architect who is rather honourd and
pleasd with the approbation of Wise Men  Artists

It may be that these created Gods are immortal or it may be that after
many Ages they are changed and others Supply their Places

Howbeit I conceive that each of these is exceeding wise and good and
very powerful and that Each has made for himself one glorious Sun
attended with a beautiful and admirable System of Planets

It is that particular Wise and good God who is the author and owner of
our System that I propose for the object of my praise and adoration

For I conceive that he has in himself some of those Passions he has
planted in us and that since he has given us Reason whereby we are
capable of observing his Wisdom in the Creation he is not above caring
for us being pleasd with our Praise and offended when we slight Him
or neglect his Glory

I conceive for many Reasons that he is a good Being and as I should
be happy to have so wise good and powerful a Being my Friend let me
consider in what manner I shall make myself most acceptable to him

Next to the Praise resulting from and due to his Wisdom I believe he is
pleasd and delights in the Happiness of those he has created and since
without Virtue Man can have no Happiness in this World I firmly believe
he delights to see me Virtuous because he is pleased when he sees Me
Happy

And since he has created many Things which seem purely designd for the
Delight of Man I believe he is not offended when he sees his Children
solace themselves in any manner of pleasant exercises and Innocent
Delights and I think no Pleasure innocent that is to Man hurtful

I love him therefore for his Goodness and I adore him for his
Wisdom

Let me then not fail to praise my God continually for it is his Due
and it is all I can return for his many Favours and great Goodness to
me and let me resolve to be virtuous that I may be happy that I may
please Him who is delighted to see me happy Amen


ADORATION

PREL Being mindful that before I address the Deity my soul ought to be
calm and serene free from Passion and Perturbation or otherwise
elevated with Rational Joy and Pleasure I ought to use a Countenance
that expresses a filial Respect mixed wth a kind of Smiling that
Signifies inward Joy and Satisfaction and Admiration

O wise God my good Father

Thou beholdest the sincerity of my Heart and of my Devotion Grant me a
Continuance of thy Favour

 O Creator O Father I believe that thou art Good and that thou art
pleasd with the pleasure of thy childrenPraised be thy name for
Ever

 By thy Power hast thou made the glorious Sun with his attending
Worlds from the energy of thy mighty Will they first received their
prodigious motion and by thy Wisdom hast thou prescribed the wondrous
Laws by which they movePraised be thy name for Ever

 By thy Wisdom hast thou formed all Things Thou hast created Man
bestowing Life and Reason and placed him in Dignity superior to thy
other earthly CreaturesPraised be thy name for Ever

 Thy Wisdom thy Power and thy Goodness are everywhere clearly seen
in the air and in the water in the Heaven and on the Earth Thou
providest for the various winged Fowl and the innumerable Inhabitants
of the Water thou givest Cold and Heat Rain and Sunshine in their
Season  to the Fruits of the Earth IncreasePraised be thy name for
Ever

 Thou abhorrest in thy Creatures Treachery and Deceit Malice
Revenge Intemperance and every other hurtful Vice but Thou art a
Lover of Justice and Sincerity of Friendship and Benevolence and every
Virtue Thou art my Friend my Father and my BenefactorPraised be
thy name O God for Ever Amen

After this it will not be improper to read part of some such Book as
Rays Wisdom of God in the Creation or Blackmore on the Creation
or the Archbishop of Cambrays Demonstration of the Being of a God
c or else spend some Minutes in a serious Silence contemplating on
those Subjects

Then sing

MILTONS HYMN TO THE CREATOR

Here follows the Reading of some Book or part of a Book Discoursing
on and exciting to Moral Virtue


PETITION

Things which we often hear mentioned in the Petitions of Men to the
Deity would prove real Goods if they were in our Possession and as I
have reason to hope and believe that the Goodness of my Heavenly Father
will not withold from me a suitable share of Temporal Blessings if by a
Virtuous and holy Life I conciliate his Favour and Kindness Therefore I
presume not to ask such things but rather humbly and with a Sincere
Heart express my earnest desires that he would graciously assist my
Continual Endeavours and Resolutions of eschewing Vice and embracing
Virtue which Kind of Supplications will at least be thus far
beneficial as they remind me in a solemn manner of my Extensive duty

    and Profaneness and in my Addresses to Thee carefully

    careful for its good valiant in its defence and obedient to
    its Laws abhorring Treason as much as TyrannyHelp me O

    submissive avoiding Pride Disrespect and ContumacyHelp

MR ANDREW BRADFORD

I design this to acquaint you that I who have long been one of your
Courteous Readers have lately entertaind some Thoughts of setting up
for an Author mySelf not out of the least Vanity I assure you or
Desire of showing my Parts but purely for the Good of my Country

I have often observd with Concern that your Mercury is not always
equally entertaining The Delay of Ships expected in and want of fresh
Advices from Europe make it frequently very Dull and I find the
Freezing of our River has the same Effect on News as on Trade With more
Concern have I continually observd the growing Vices and Follies of my
Countryfolk and tho Reformation is properly the concern of every
Man that is Every one ought to mend One yet tis too true in this
Case that what is every Bodys Business is nobodys Business and the
Business is done accordingly I therefore upon mature Deliberation
think fit to take Nobodys Business wholly into my own Hands and out
of Zeal for the Publick Good design to erect mySelf into a Kind of
Censor Morum proposing with your Allowance to make Use of the
Weekly Mercury as a Vehicle in which my Remonstrances shall be
conveyd to the World

I am sensible I have in this Particular undertaken a very unthankful
Office and expect little besides my Labour for my Pains Nay tis
probable I may displease a great Number of your Readers who will not
very well like to pay s a Year for being told of their Faults But
as most People delight in Censure when they themselves are not the
Objects of it if any are offended at my publickly exposing their
private Vices I promise they shall have the Satisfaction in a very
little Time of seeing their good Friends and Neighbours in the same
Circumstances

However let the Fair Sex be assurd that I shall always treat them and
their Affairs with the utmost Decency and Respect I intend now and then
to dedicate a Chapter wholly to their Service and if my Lectures any
Way contribute to the Embellishment of their Minds and brightning of
their Understandings without offending their Modesty I doubt not of
having their Favour and Encouragement

Tis certain that no Country in the World produces naturally finer
Spirits than ours Men of Genius for every kind of Science and capable
of acquiring to Perfection every Qualification that is in Esteem among
Mankind But as few here have the Advantage of good Books for want of
which good Conversation is still more scarce it would doubtless have
been very acceptable to your Readers if instead of an old outofdate
Article from Muscovy or Hungary you had entertained them with some
wellchosen Extract from a good Author This I shall sometimes do when
I happen to have nothing of my own to say that I think of more
Consequence Sometimes I propose to deliver Lectures of Morality or
Philosophy and because I am naturally enclind to be meddling with
Things that dont concern me perhaps I may sometimes talk Politicks
And if I can by any means furnish out a Weekly Entertainment for the
Publick that will give a rational Diversion and at the same Time be
instructive to the Readers I shall think my Leisure Hours well
employd And if you publish this I hereby invite all ingenious
Gentlemen and others that approve of such an Undertaking to my
Assistance and Correspondence

Tis like by this Time you have a Curiosity to be acquainted with my
Name and Character As I do not aim at publick Praise I design to
remain concealed and there are such Numbers of our Family and Relations
at this Time in the Country that tho Ive signd my Name at full
Length I am not under the least Apprehension of being distinguishd and
discoverd by it My Character indeed I would favour you with but
that I am cautious of praising mySelf lest I should be told my
Trumpeters dead And I cannot find in my Heart at present to say any
Thing to my own Disadvantage

It is very common with Authors in their first Performances to talk to
their Readers thus If this meets with a SUITABLE Reception Or If
this should meet with DUE Encouragement I shall hereafter publish c
This only manifests the Value they put on their own Writings since they
think to frighten the Publick into their Applause by threatning that
unless you approve what they have already wrote they intend never to
write again when perhaps it maynt be a Pin Matter whether they ever do
or no As I have not observd the Criticks to be more favourable on this
Account I shall always avoid saying any Thing of the Kind and conclude
with telling you that if you send me a Bottle of Ink and a Quire of
Paper by the Bearer you may depend on hearing further from Sir your
most humble Servant

    All fools have still an itching to deride
    And fain would be upon the laughing side
                                           POPE

Monsieur de la Rochefoucault tells us somewhere in his Memoirs that the
Prince of Cond delighted much in ridicule and used frequently to shut
himself up for half a day together in his chamber with a gentleman that
was his favorite purposely to divert himself with examining what was
the foible or ridiculous side of every noted person in the court That
gentleman said afterwards in some company that he thought nothing was
more ridiculous in anybody than this same humour in the Prince and I
am somewhat inclined to be of this opinion The general tendency there
is among us to this embellishment which I fear has too often grossly
imposed upon my loving countrymen instead of wit and the applause it
meets with from a rising generation fill me with fearful apprehensions
for the future reputation of my country A young man of modesty which
is the most certain indication of large capacities is hereby
discouraged from attempting to make any figure in life his
apprehensions of being outlaughed will force him to continue in a
restless obscurity without having an opportunity of knowing his own
merit himself or discovering it to the world rather than venture to
oppose himself in a place where a pun or a sneer shall pass for wit
noise for reason and the strength of the argument be judged by that of
the lungs

Among these witty gentlemen let us take a view of Ridentius What a
contemptible figure does he make with his train of paltry admirers This
wight shall give himself an hours diversion with the cock of a mans
hat the heels of his shoes an unguarded expression in his discourse
or even some personal defect and the height of his low ambition is to
put some one of the company to the blush who perhaps must pay an equal
share of the reckoning with himself If such a fellow makes laughing the
sole end and purpose of his life if it is necessary to his
constitution or if he has a great desire of growing suddenly fat let
him eat let him give public notice where any dull stupid rogue may get
a quart of fourpenny for being laughed at but it is barbarously
unhandsome when friends meet for the benefit of conversation and a
proper relaxation from business that one should be the butt of the
company and four men made merry at the cost of the fifth

How different from this character is that of the goodnatured gay
Eugenius who never spoke yet but with a design to divert and please
and who was never yet baulked in his intention Eugenius takes more
delight in applying the wit of his friends than in being admired
himself and if any one of the company is so unfortunate as to be
touched a little too nearly he will make use of some ingenious artifice
to turn the edge of ridicule another way choosing rather to make
himself a public jest than be at the pain of seeing his friend in
confusion

Among the tribe of laughers I reckon the petty gentlemen that write
satires and carry them about in their pockets reading them themselves
in all company they happen into taking an advantage of the ill taste of
the town to make themselves famous for a pack of paltry low nonsense
for which they deserve to be kicked rather than admired by all who have
the least tincture of politeness These I take to be the most
incorrigible of all my readers nay I expect they will be squibbing at
the BusyBody himself However the only favour he begs of them is this
that if they cannot control their overbearing itch of scribbling let
him be attacked in downright biting lyrics for there is no satire he
dreads half so much as an attempt towards a panegyric

It is said that the Persians in their ancient Constitution had publick
Schools in which Virtue was taught as a Liberal Art or Science and it
is certainly of more Consequence to a Man that he has learnt to govern
his Passions in spite of Temptation to be just in his Dealings to be
Temperate in his Pleasures to support himself with Fortitude under his
Misfortunes to behave with Prudence in all Affairs and in every
Circumstance of Life I say it is of much more real Advantage to him
to be thus qualified than to be a Master of all the Arts and Sciences
in the World beside

Virtue alone is sufficient to make a Man Great Glorious and Happy He
that is acquainted with Cato as I am cannot help thinking as I do now
and will acknowledge he deserves the Name without being honourd by it
Cato is a Man whom Fortune has placd in the most obscure Part of the
Country His Circumstances are such as only put him above Necessity
without affording him many Superfluities Yet who is greater than Cato
I happened but the other Day to be at a House in Town where among
others were met Men of the most Note in this Place Cato had Business
with some of them and knockd at the Door The most trifling Actions of
a Man in my Opinion as well as the smallest Features and Lineaments of
the Face give a nice Observer some Notion of his Mind Methought he
rappd in such a peculiar Manner as seemd of itself to express there
was One who deservd as well as desird Admission He appeard in the
plainest Country Garb his Great Coat was coarse and looked old and
threadbare his Linnen was homespun his Beard perhaps of Seven Days
Growth his Shoes thick and heavy and every Part of his Dress
corresponding Why was this Man receivd with such concurring Respect
from every Person in the Room even from those who had never known him
or seen him before It was not an exquisite Form of Person or Grandeur
of Dress that struck us with Admiration

I believe long Habits of Virtue have a sensible Effect on the
Countenance There was something in the Air of his Face that manifested
the true Greatness of his Mind which likewise appeard in all he said
and in every Part of his Behaviour obliging us to regard him with a
Kind of Veneration His Aspect is sweetened with Humanity and
Benevolence and at the same Time enboldned with Resolution equally
free from a diffident Bashfulness and an unbecoming Assurance The
Consciousness of his own innate Worth and unshaken Integrity renders him
calm and undaunted in the Presence of the most Great and Powerful and
upon the most extraordinary Occasions His strict Justice and known
Impartiality make him the Arbitrator and Decider of all Differences
that arise for many Miles around him without putting his Neighbours to
the Charge Perplexity and Uncertainty of LawSuits He always speaks
the Thing he means which he is never afraid or ashamd to do because
he knows he always means well and therefore is never obligd to blush
and feel the Confusion of finding himself detected in the Meanness of a
Falsehood He never contrives Ill against his Neighbour and therefore
is never seen with a lowring suspicious Aspect A mixture of Innocence
and Wisdom makes him ever seriously chearful His generous Hospitality
to Strangers according to his Ability his Goodness his Charity his
Courage in the Cause of the Oppressed his Fidelity in Friendship his
Humility his Honesty and Sincerity his Moderation and his Loyalty to
the Government his Piety his Temperance his Love to Mankind his
Magnanimity his PublickSpiritedness and in fine his consummate
Virtue make him justly deserve to be esteemd the Glory of his Country

    The Brave do never shun the Light
     Just are their Thoughts and open are their Tempers
     Freely without Disguise they love and hate
     Still are they found in the fair Face of Day
     And Heaven and Men are Judges of their Actions
                                              ROWE

Who would not rather chuse if it were in his Choice to merit the above
Character than be the richest the most learned or the most powerful
Man in the Province without it

Almost every Man has a strong natural Desire of being valud and
esteemd by the rest of his Species but I am concernd and grievd to
see how few fall into the Right and only infallible Method of becoming
so That laudable Ambition is too commonly misapplyd and often ill
employd Some to make themselves considerable pursue Learning others
grasp at Wealth some aim at being thought witty and others are only
careful to make the most of an handsome Person But what is Wit or
Wealth or Form or Learning when compard with Virtue Tis true we
love the handsome we applaud the Learned and we fear the Rich and
Powerful but we even Worship and adore the Virtuous Nor is it strange
since Men of Virtue are so rare so very rare to be found If we were as
industrious to become Good as to make ourselves Great we should become
really Great by being Good and the Number of valuable Men would be much
increased but it is a Grand Mistake to think of being Great without
Goodness and I pronounce it as certain that there was never yet a
truly Great Man that was not at the same Time truly Virtuous

O Cretico thou sowre Philosopher Thou cunning Statesman Thou art
crafty but far from being Wise When wilt thou be esteemd regarded
and belovd like Cato When wilt thou among thy Creatures meet with
that unfeignd respect and warm Goodwill that all Men have for him
Wilt thou never understand that the cringing mean submissive
Deportment of thy Dependents is like the worship paid by Indians to
the Devil rather thro Fear of the Harm thou mayst do to them than
out of Gratitude for the Favours they have receivd of thee Thou art
not wholly void of Virtue there are many good Things in thee and many
good Actions reported of thee Be advised by thy Friend Neglect those
musty Authors let them be coverd with Dust and moulder on their
proper Shelves and do thou apply thyself to a Study much more
profitable The knowledge of Mankind and of thySelf

    Ne quid nimis

In my first Paper I invited the Learned and the Ingenious to join with
me in this Undertaking and I now repeat that Invitation I would have
such Gentlemen take this Opportunity by trying their Talent in Writing
of diverting themselves and their Friends and improving the Taste of
the Town And because I would encourage all Wit of our own Growth and
Produce I hereby promise that whoever shall send me a little Essay on
some moral or other Subject that is fit for publick View in this
Manner and not basely borrowd from any other Author I shall receive
it with Candour and take care to place it to the best Advantage It
will be hard if we cannot muster up in the whole Country a sufficient
Stock of Sense to supply the BusyBody at least for a Twelvemonth

For my own Part I have already professd that I have the Good of my
Country wholly at Heart in this Design without the least sinister View
my chief Purpose being to inculcate the noble Principles of Virtue and
depreciate Vice of every kind But as I know the Mob hate Instruction
and the Generality would never read beyond the first Line of my
Lectures if they were actually filld with nothing but wholesome
Precepts and Advice I must therefore sometimes humor them in their own
Way There are a Set of Great Names in the Province who are the common
Objects of Popular Dislike If I can now and then overcome my
Reluctance and prevail with myself to satyrize a little one of these
Gentlemen the Expectation of meeting with such a Gratification will
induce many to read me through who would otherwise proceed immediately
to the Foreign News As I am very well assured the greatest Men among us
have a sincere Love for their Country notwithstanding its Ingratitude
and the Insinuations of the Envious and Malicious to the contrary so I
doubt not but they will chearfully tolerate me in the Liberty I design
to take for the End above mentioned

As yet I have but few Correspondents tho they begin now to increase
The following Letter left for me at the Printers is one of the first
I have receivd which I regard the more for that it comes from one of
the Fair Sex and because I have myself oftentimes sufferd under the
Grievance therein complaind of

    TO THE BUSYBODY

    Sir

    You having set yourself up for a Censuror Morum as I
    think you call it which is said to mean a Reformer of
    Manners I know no Person more proper to be applyd to for
    Redress in all the Grievances we suffer from Want of
    Manners in some People You must know I am a single Woman
    and keep a Shop in this Town for a Livelyhood There is a
    certain Neighbour of mine who is really agreeable Company
    enough and with whom I have had an Intimacy of some Time
    standing but of late she makes her visits so excessively
    often and stays so very long every Visit that I am tird
    out of all Patience I have no Manner of Time at all to
    myself and you who seem to be a wise Man must needs be
    sensible that every Person has little Secrets and Privacies
    that are not proper to be exposd even to the nearest Friend
    Now I cannot do the least Thing in the World but she must
    know all about it and it is a Wonder I have found an
    Opportunity to write you this Letter My Misfortune is that
    I respect her very well and know not how to disoblige her so
    much as to tell her I should be glad to have less other
    Company for if I should once hint such a Thing I am afraid
    she would resent it so as never to darken my Door again

    But alas Sir I have not yet told you half my Affliction
    She has two Children that are just big enough to run about
    and do pretty Mischief these are continually along with
    Mamma either in my Room or Shop if I have ever so many
    Customers or People with me about Business Sometimes they
    pull the Goods off my low Shelves down to the Ground and
    perhaps where one of them has just been making Water My
    Friend takes up the Stuff and cries Eh thou little wicked
    mischievous Rogue But however it has done no great
    Damage tis only wet a little and so puts it up upon the
    Shelf again Sometimes they get to my Cask of Nails behind
    the Counter and divert themselves to my great Vexation
    with mixing my Tenpenny and Eightpenny and Fourpenny
    together I endeavour to conceal my Uneasiness as much as
    possible and with a grave Look go to Sorting them out She
    cries Dont thee trouble thyself Neighbour Let them play
    a little Ill put all to rights myself before I go But
    Things are never so put to rights but that I find a great
    deal of Work to do after they are gone Thus Sir I have all
    the Trouble and Pesterment of Children without the Pleasure
    ofcalling them my own and they are now so usd to being
    here that they will be content nowhere else If she would
    have been so kind as to have moderated her Visits to ten
    times a Day and stayd but half an hour at a Time I should
    have been contented and I believe never have given you this
    Trouble But this very Morning they have so tormented me
    that I could bear no longer for while the Mother was asking
    me twenty impertinent Questions the youngest got to my
    Nails and with great Delight rattled them by handfuls all
    over the Floor and the other at the same Time made such a
    terrible Din upon my Counter with a Hammer that I grew half
    distracted I was just then about to make myself a new Suit
    of Pinners but in the Fret and Confusion I cut it quite out
    of all Manner of Shape and utterly spoild a Piece of the
    first Muslin

    Pray Sir tell me what I shall do and talk a little
    against such unreasonable Visiting in your next Paper tho I
    would not have her affronted with me for a great Deal for
    sincerely I love her and her Children as well I think as a
    Neighbour can and she buys a great many Things in a Year at
    my Shop But I would beg her to consider that she uses me
    unmercifully Tho I believe it is only for want of Thought
    But I have twenty Things more to tell you besides all this
    There is a handsome Gentleman that has a Mind I dont
    question to make love to me but he cant get the least
    Opportunity toO dear here she comes again I must
    conclude yours c

                                                 PATIENCE

Indeed tis well enough as it happens that she is come to shorten
this Complaint which I think is full long enough already and probably
would otherwise have been as long again However I must confess I
cannot help pitying my Correspondents Case and in her Behalf exhort
the Visitor to remember and consider the Words of the Wise Man
Withdraw thy Foot from the House of thy Neighbour lest he grow weary
of thee and so hate thee It is I believe a nice thing and very
difficult to regulate our Visits in such a Manner as never to give
Offence by coming too seldom or too often or departing too abruptly
or staying too long However in my Opinion it is safest for most
People in a general way who are unwilling to disoblige to visit
seldom and tarry but a little while in a Place notwithstanding
pressing invitations which are many times insincere And tho more of
your Company should be really desird yet in this Case too much
Reservedness is a Fault more easily excusd than the Contrary

Men are subjected to various Inconveniences meerly through lack of a
small Share of Courage which is a Quality very necessary in the common
Occurrences of Life as well as in a Battle How many Impertinences do
we daily suffer with great Uneasiness because we have not Courage
enough to discover our Dislike And why may not a Man use the Boldness
and Freedom of telling his Friends that their long Visits sometimes
incommode him On this Occasion it may be entertaining to some of my
Readers if I acquaint them with the Turkish Manner of entertaining
Visitors which I have from an Author of unquestionable Veracity who
assures us that even the Turks are not so ignorant of Civility and the
Arts of Endearment but that they can practise them with as much
Exactness as any other Nation whenever they have a Mind to shew
themselves obliging

    When you visit a Person of Quality says he and have
    talkd over your Business or the Complements or whatever
    Concern brought you thither he makes a Sign to have Things
    servd in for the Entertainment which is generally a
    little Sweetmeat a Dish of Sherbet and another of Coffee
    all which are immediately brought in by the Servants and
    tenderd to all the Guests in Order with the greatest Care
    and Awfulness imaginable At last comes the finishing Part
    of your Entertainment which is Perfuming the Beards of the
    Company a Ceremony which is performd in this Manner They
    have for the Purpose a small Silver ChaffingDish coverd
    with a Lid full of Holes and fixed upon a handsome Plate
    In this they put some fresh Coals and upon them a piece of
    Lignum Aloes and shutting it up the smoak immediately
    ascends with a grateful Odour thro the Holes of the Cover
    This smoak is held under every ones Chin and offerd as it
    were a Sacrifice to his Beard The bristly Idol soon
    receives the Reverence done to it and so greedily takes in
    and incorporates the gummy Steam that it retains the Savour
    of it and may serve for a Nosegay a good while after

    This Ceremony may perhaps seem ridiculous at first hearing
    but it passes among the Turks for a high Gratification
    And I will say this in its Vindication that its Design is
    very wise and useful For it is understood to give a civil
    Dismission to the Visitants intimating to them that the
    Master of the House has Business to do or some other
    Avocation that permits them to go away as soon as they
    please and the sooner after this Ceremony the better By
    this Means you may at any Time without Offence deliver
    yourself from being detaind from your Affairs by tedious
    and unseasonable Visits and from being constraind to use
    that Piece of Hypocrisy so common in the World of pressing
    those to stay longer with you whom perhaps in your Heart
    you wish a great Way off for having troubled you so long
    already

Thus far my Author For my own Part I have taken such a Fancy to this
Turkish Custom that for the future I shall put something like it in
Practice I have provided a Bottle of right French Brandy for the Men
and CitronWater for the Ladies After I have treated with a Dram and
presented a Pinch of my best Snuff I expect all Company will retire
and leave me to pursue my Studies for the Good of the Publick

PREFACE TO THE PENNSYLVANIA GAZETTE

October  

The Pennsylvania Gazette being now to be carryd on by other Hands the
Reader may expect some Account of the Method we design to proceed
in

Upon a view of Chamberss great Dictionaries from whence were taken the
Materials of the Universal Instructor in all Arts and Sciences which
usually made the First Part of this Paper we find that besides their
containing many Things abstruse or insignificant to us it will probably
be fifty Years before the Whole can be gone thro in this Manner of
Publication There are likewise in those Books continual References from
Things under one Letter of the Alphabet to those under another which
relate to the same Subject and are necessary to explain and compleat
it these taken in their Turn may perhaps be Ten Years distant and
since it is likely that they who desire to acquaint themselves with any
particular Art or Science would gladly have the whole before them in
much less time we believe our Readers will not think such a Method of
communicating Knowledge to be a proper One

However tho we do not intend to continue the Publication of those
Dictionaries in a regular Alphabetical Method as has hitherto been
done yet as several Things exhibited from them in the Course of these
Papers have been entertaining to such of the Curious who never had and
cannot have the Advantage of good Libraries and as there are many
Things still behind which being in this Manner made generally known
may perhaps become of considerable Use by giving such Hints to the
excellent natural Geniuss of our Country as may contribute either to
the Improvement of our present Manufactures or towards the Invention of
new Ones we propose from Time to Time to communicate such particular
Parts as appear to be of the most general Consequence

As to the Religious Courtship Part of which has been retald to the
Publick in these Papers the Reader may be informd that the whole Book
will probably in a little Time be printed and bound up by itself and
those who approve of it will doubtless be better pleasd to have it
entire than in this broken interrupted Manner

There are many who have long desired to see a good NewsPaper in
Pennsylvania and we hope those Gentlemen who are able will contribute
towards the making This such We ask Assistance because we are fully
sensible that to publish a good NewsPaper is not so easy an
Undertaking as many People imagine it to be The Author of a Gazette in
the Opinion of the Learned ought to be qualified with an extensive
Acquaintance with Languages a great Easiness and Command of Writing and
Relating Things clearly and intelligibly and in few Words he should be
able to speak of War both by Land and Sea be well acquainted with
Geography with the History of the Time with the several Interests of
Princes and States the Secrets of Courts and the Manners and Customs
of all Nations Men thus accomplishd are very rare in this remote Part
of the World and it would be well if the Writer of these Papers could
make up among his Friends what is wanting in himself

Upon the Whole we may assure the Publick that as far as the
Encouragement we meet with will enable us no Care and Pains shall be
omitted that may make the Pennsylvania Gazette as agreeable and useful
an Entertainment as the Nature of the Thing will allow



A DIALOGUE BETWEEN PHILOCLES AND HORATIO MEETING ACCIDENTALLY IN THE
FIELDS CONCERNING VIRTUE AND PLEASURE

From the Pennsylvania Gazette June  

Philocles My friend Horatio I am very glad to see you prithee
how came such a Man as you alone and musing too What Misfortune in
your Pleasures has sent you to Philosophy for Relief

Horatio You guess very right my dear Philocles We
Pleasurehunters are never without em and yet so enchanting is the
Game we cant quit the Chace How calm and undisturbed is your Life
How free from present Embarrassments and future Cares I know you love
me and look with Compassion upon my Conduct Shew me then the Path
which leads up to that constant and invariable Good which I have heard
you so beautifully describe and which you seem so fully to possess

Phil There are few Men in the World I value more than you Horatio
for amidst all your Foibles and painful Pursuits of Pleasure I have oft
observed in you an honest Heart and a Mind strongly bent towards
Virtue I wish from my Soul I could assist you in acting steadily the
Part of a reasonable Creature for if you would not think it a Paradox
I should tell you I love you better than you do yourself

Hor A Paradox indeed Better than I do myself When I love my dear
self so well that I love every Thing else for my own sake

Phil He only loves himself well who rightly and judiciously loves
himself

Hor What do you mean by that Philocles You Men of Reason and
Virtue are always dealing in Mysteries tho you laugh at em when the
Church makes em I think he loves himself very well and very
judiciously too as you call it who allows himself to do whatever he
pleases

Phil What though it be to the Ruin and Destruction of that very Self
which he loves so well That Man alone loves himself rightly who
procures the greatest possible Good to himself thro the whole of his
Existence and so pursues Pleasure as not to give for it more than tis
worth

Hor That depends all upon Opinion Who shall judge what the Pleasure
is worth Supposing a pleasing Form of the fair Kind strikes me so much
that I can enjoy nothing without the Enjoyment of that one Object Or
that Pleasure in general is so favorite a Mistress that I will take her
as Men do their Wives for better for worse mind no Consequences nor
regarding whats to come Why should I not do it

Phil Suppose Horatio that a Friend of yours entred into the World
about TwoandTwenty with a healthful vigorous Body and a fair
plentiful Estate of about Five Hundred Pounds a Year and yet before he
had reached Thirty should by following his Pleasures and not as you
say duly regarding Consequences have run out of his Estate and
disabled his Body to that Degree that he had neither the Means nor
Capacity of Enjoyment left nor any Thing else to do but wisely shoot
himself through the Head to be at rest what would you say to this
unfortunate Mans Conduct Is it wrong by Opinion or Fancy only Or is
there really a Right and Wrong in the Case Is not one Opinion of Life
and Action juster than another Or one Sort of Conduct preferable to
another Or does that miserable Son of Pleasure appear as reasonable
and lovely a Being in your Eyes as a Man who by prudently and rightly
gratifying his natural Passions had preserved his Body in full Health
and his Estate entire and enjoyd both to a good old Age and then died
with a thankful Heart for the good Things he had received and with an
entire Submission to the Will of Him who first called him into Being
Say Horatio are these Men equally wise and happy And is every Thing
to be measured by mere Fancy and Opinion without considering whether
that Fancy or Opinion be right

Hor Hardly so neither I think yet sure the wise and good Author of
Nature could never make us to plague us He could never give us
Passions on purpose to subdue and conquer em nor produce this Self of
mine or any other self only that it may be denied for that is denying
the Works of the great Creator himself Selfdenial then which is what
I suppose you mean by Prudence seems to me not only absurd but very
dishonourable to that Supreme Wisdom and Goodness which is supposed to
make so ridiculous and Contradictious a Creature that must be always
fighting with himself in order to be at rest and undergo voluntary
Hardships in order to be happy Are we created sick only to be
commanded to be Sound Are we born under one Law our Passions and yet
bound to another that of Reason Answer me Philocles for I am
warmly concerned for the Honour of Nature the Mother of us all

Phil I find Horatio my two Characters have affrighted you so that
you decline the Trial of what is Good by reason And had rather make a
bold Attack upon Providence the usual Way of you Gentlemen of Fashion
who when by living in Defiance of the eternal Rules of Reason you have
plunged yourselves into a thousand Difficulties endeavour to make
yourselves easy by throwing the Burden upon Nature You are Horatio
in a very miserable Condition indeed for you say you cant be happy if
you controul your Passions and you feel yourself miserable by an
unrestrained Gratification of em so that heres Evil irremediable
Evil either way

Hor That is very true at least it appears so to me Pray what have
you to say Philocles in Honour of Nature or Providence methinks Im
in Pain for her How do you rescue her poor Lady

Phil This my dear Horatio I have to say that what you find Fault
with and clamour against as the most terrible Evil in the World
Selfdenial is really the greatest Good and the highest
Selfgratification If indeed you use the Word in the Sense of some
weak sour Moralists and much weaker Divines youll have just Reason to
laugh at it but if you take it as understood by Philosophers and Men
of Sense you will presently see her Charms and fly to her Embraces
notwithstanding her demure Looks as absolutely necessary to produce
even your own darling sole Good Pleasure For Selfdenial is never a
Duty or a reasonable Action but as tis a natural Means of procuring
more Pleasure than you can taste without it so that this grave
Saintlike Guide to Happiness as rough and dreadful as she has been
made to appear is in truth the kindest and most beautiful Mistress in
the World

Hor Prithee Philocles do not wrap yourself in Allegory and
Metaphor Why do you teaze me thus I long to be satisfied what this
Philosophical Selfdenial is the Necessity and Reason of it Im
impatient and all on Fire explain therefore in your beautiful
natural easy Way of Reasoning what Im to understand by this grave Lady
of yours with so forbidding downcast Looks and yet so absolutely
necessary to my Pleasures I stand ready to embrace her for you know
Pleasure I court under all Shapes and Forms

Phil Attend then and youll see the Reason of this Philosophical
Selfdenial There can be no absolute Perfection in any Creature
because every Creature is derived and dependent No created Being can
be Allwise Allgood and Allpowerful because his Powers and
Capacities are finite and limited consequently whatever is created
must in its own Nature be subject to Error Irregularity Excess and
Disorder All intelligent rational Agents find in themselves a Power of
judging what kind of Beings they are what Actions are proper to
preserve em and what Consequences will generally attend them what
Pleasures they are formd for and to what Degree their Natures are
capable of receiving them All we have to do then Horatio is to
consider when we are surprizd with a new Object and passionately
desire to enjoy it whether the gratifying that Passion be consistent
with the gratifying other Passions and Appetites equal if not more
necessary to us And whether it consists with our Happiness Tomorrow
next Week or next Year for as we all wish to live we are obliged by
Reason to take as much Care for our future as our present Happiness
and not build one upon the Ruins of tother But if thro the Strength
and Power of a present Passion and thro want of attending to
Consequences we have errd and exceeded the Bounds which Nature or
Reason have set us we are then for our own Sakes to refrain or deny
ourselves a present momentary Pleasure for a future constant and
durable one So that this Philosophical Selfdenial is only refusing to
do an Action which you strongly desire because tis inconsistent with
your Health Fortunes or Circumstances in the World or in other
Words because twould cost you more than twas worth You would lose by
it as a Man of Pleasure Thus you see Horatio that Selfdenial is
not only the most reasonable but the most pleasant Thing in the World

Hor We are just coming into Town so that we cant pursue this
Argument any farther at present you have said a great deal for Nature
Providence and Reason Happy are they who can follow such divine
Guides

Phil Horatio good Night I wish you wise in your Pleasures

Hor I wish Philocles I could be as wise in my Pleasures as you
are pleasantly Wise your Wisdom is agreeable your Virtue is amiable
and your Philosophy the highest Luxury Adieu thou enchanting Reasoner



A SECOND DIALOGUE BETWEEN PHILOCLES AND HORATIO CONCERNING VIRTUE AND
PLEASURE

From the Pennsylvania Gazette July  

Philocles Dear Horatio where hast thou been these three or four
Months What new Adventures have you fallen upon since I met you in
these delightful allinspiring Fields and wondred how such a
Pleasurehunter as you could bear being alone

Horatio O Philocles thou best of Friends because a Friend to
Reason and Virtue I am very glad to see you Dont you remember I told
you then that some Misfortunes in my Pleasures had sent me to
Philosophy for Relief But now I do assure you I can without a Sigh
leave other Pleasures for those of Philosophy I can hear the Word
Reason mentioned and Virtue praised without Laughing Dont I bid
fair for Conversion think you

Phil Very fair Horatio for I remember the Time when Reason
Virtue and Pleasure were the same Thing with you When you counted
nothing Good but what pleasd nor any thing Reasonable but what you got
by When you made a Jest of a Mind and the Pleasures of Reflection and
elegantly placd your sole Happiness like the rest of the Animal
Creation in the Gratifications of Sense

Hor I did so But in our last Conversation when walking upon the
Brow of this Hill and looking down on that broad rapid River and yon
widelyextended beautifullyvaried Plain you taught me another
Doctrine You shewed me that Selfdenial which above all Things I
abhorred was really the greatest Good and the highest
Selfgratification and absolutely necessary to produce even my own
darling sole Good Pleasure

Phil True I told you that Selfdenial was never a Duty but when it
was a natural Means of procuring more Pleasure than we could taste
without it That as we all strongly desire to live and to live only to
enjoy we should take as much Care about our future as our present
Happiness and not build one upon the Ruins of tother That we should
look to the End and regard Consequences and if thro want of
Attention we had errd and exceeded the Bounds which Nature had set us
we were then obliged for our own Sakes to refrain or deny ourselves a
present momentary Pleasure for a future constant and durable Good

Hor You have shewn Philocles that Selfdenial which weak or
interested Men have rendred the most forbidding is really the most
delightful and amiable the most reasonable and pleasant Thing in the
World In a Word if I understand you aright Selfdenial is in Truth
Selfrecognising Selfacknowledging or Selfowning But now my
Friend you are to perform another Promise and shew me the Path which
leads up to that constant durable and invariable Good which I have
heard you so beautifully describe and which you seem so fully to
possess Is not this Good of yours a mere Chimera Can any Thing be
constant in a World which is eternally changing and which appears to
exist by an everlasting Revolution of one Thing into another and where
every Thing without us and every Thing within us is in perpetual
Motion What is this constant durable Good then of yours Prithee
satisfy my Soul for Im all on Fire and impatient to enjoy her
Produce this eternal blooming Goddess with neverfading Charms and see
whether I wont embrace her with as much Eagerness and Rapture as you

Phil You seem enthusiastically warm Horatio I will wait till you
are cool enough to attend to the sober dispassionate Voice of Reason

Hor You mistake me my dear Philocles my Warmth is not so great as
to run away with my Reason it is only just raised enough to open my
Faculties and fit them to receive those eternal Truths and that
durable Good which you so triumphantly boasted of Begin then Im
prepared

Phil I will I believe Horatio with all your Skepticism about
you you will allow that Good to be constant which is never absent from
you and that to be durable which never Ends but with your Being

Hor Yes go on

Phil That can never be the Good of a Creature which when present
the Creature may be miserable and when absent is certainly so

Hor I think not but pray explain what you mean for I am not much
used to this abstract Way of Reasoning

Phil I mean all the Pleasures of Sense The Good of Man cannot
consist in the mere Pleasures of Sense because when any one of those
Objects which you love is absent or cant be come at you are certainly
miserable and if the Faculty be impaird though the Object be present
you cant enjoy it So that this sensual Good depends upon a thousand
Things without and within you and all out of your Power Can this then
be the Good of Man Say Horatio what think you Is not this a
chequerd fleeting fantastical Good Can that in any propriety of
Speech be called the Good of Man which even while he is tasting he
may be miserable and which when he cannot taste he is necessarily so
Can that be our Good which costs us a great deal of Pains to obtain
which cloys in possessing for which we must wait the Return of Appetite
before we can enjoy again Or is that our Good which we can come at
without Difficulty which is heightened by Possession which never ends
in Weariness and Disappointment and which the more we enjoy the
better qualified we are to enjoy on

Hor The latter I think but why do you torment me thus Philocles
shew me this Good immediately

Phil I have shewed you what tis not it is not sensual but tis
rational and moral Good It is doing all the Good we can to others by
Acts of Humanity Friendship Generosity and Benevolence This is that
constant and durable Good which will afford Contentment and
Satisfaction always alike without Variation or Diminution I speak to
your Experience now Horatio Did you ever find yourself weary of
relieving the Miserable or of raising the Distressed into Life or
Happiness Or rather dont you find the Pleasure grow upon you by
Repetition and that tis greater in the Reflection than in the Act
itself Is there a Pleasure upon Earth to be compared with that which
arises from the Sense of making others happy Can this Pleasure ever be
absent or ever end but with your Being Does it not always accompany
you Doth not it lie down and rise with you live as long as you live
give you Consolation in the Article of Death and remain with you in
that gloomy Hour when all other Things are going to forsake you or you
them

Hor How glowingly you paint Philocles Methinks Horatio is
amongst the Enthusiasts I feel the Passion I am enchantingly
convinced but I dont know why Overborn by something stronger than
Reason Sure some Divinity speaks within me but prithee Philocles
give me cooly the Cause why this rational and moral Good so infinitely
excels the meer natural or sensual

Phil I think Horatio that I have clearly shewn you the Difference
between merely natural or sensual Good and rational or moral Good
Natural or sensual Pleasure continues no longer than the Action itself
but this divine or moral Pleasure continues when the Action is over
and swells and grows upon your Hand by Reflection The one is
inconstant unsatisfying of short Duration and attended with
numberless Ills the other is constant yields full Satisfaction is
durable and no Evils preceding accompanying or following it But if
you enquire farther into the Cause of this Difference and would know
why the moral Pleasures are greater than the sensual perhaps the Reason
is the same as in all other Creatures That their Happiness or chief
Good consists in acting up to their chief Faculty or that Faculty which
distinguishes them from all Creatures of a different Species The chief
Faculty in a Man is his Reason and consequently his chief Good or that
which may be justly called his Good consists not merely in Action but
in reasonable Action By reasonable Actions we understand those Actions
which are preservative of the human Kind and naturally tend to produce
real and unmixed Happiness and these Actions by way of Distinction we
call Actions morally Good

Hor You speak very clearly Philocles but that no Difficulty may
remain upon my Mind pray tell me what is the real Difference between
natural Good and Ill and moral Good and Ill for I know several People
who use the Terms without Ideas

Phil That may be The Difference lies only in this that natural Good
and Ill is Pleasure and Pain Moral Good and Ill is Pleasure or Pain
produced with Intention and Design for tis the Intention only that
makes the Agent morally Good or Bad

Hor But may not a Man with a very good Intention do an ill Action

Phil Yes but then he errs in his Judgment tho his Design be good
If his Error is inevitable or such as all Things considered he could
not help he is inculpable But if it arose through want of Diligence in
forming his Judgment about the Nature of human Actions he is immoral
and culpable

Hor I find then that in order to please ourselves rightly or to do
good to others morally we should take great Care of our Opinions

Phil Nothing concerns you more for as the Happiness or real Good of
Men consists in right Action and right Action cannot be produced
without right Opinion it behoves us above all Things in this World to
take Care that our Opinions of Things be according to the Nature of
Things The Foundation of all Virtue and Happiness is Thinking rightly
He who sees an Action is right that is naturally tending to Good and
does it because of that Tendency he only is a moral Man and he alone
is capable of that constant durable and invariable Good which has
been the Subject of this Conversation

Hor How my dear philosophical Guide shall I be able to know and
determine certainly what is Right and Wrong in Life

Phil As easily as you distinguish a Circle from a Square or Light
from Darkness Look Horatio into the sacred Book of Nature read
your own Nature and view the Relation which other Men stand in to you
and you to them and youll immediately see what constitutes human
Happiness and consequently what is Right

Hor We are just coming into Town and can say no more at present You
are my good Genius Philocles You have shewed me what is good You
have redeemed me from the Slavery and Misery of Folly and Vice and made
me a free and happy Being

Phil Then I am the happiest Man in the World Be steady Horatio
Never depart from Reason and Virtue

Hor Sooner will I lose my Existence Good Night Philocles

Phil Adieu dear Horatio



A WITCH TRIAL AT MOUNT HOLLY

From the Pennsylvania Gazette Oct  

Saturday last at MountHolly about  Miles from this Place
Burlington N J near  People were gathered together to see an
Experiment or two tried on some Persons accused of Witchcraft It seems
the Accused had been charged with making their Neighbours Sheep dance
in an uncommon Manner and with causing Hogs to speak and sing Psalms
etc to the great Terror and Amazement of the kings good and
peaceable Subjects in this Province and the Accusers being very
positive that if the Accused were weighed in Scales against a Bible the
Bible would prove too heavy for them or that if they were bound and
put into the River they would swim the said Accused desirous to make
Innocence appear voluntarily offered to undergo the said Trials if  of
the most violent of their Accusers would be tried with them Accordingly
the Time and Place was agreed on and advertised about the Country The
Accusers were  Man and  Woman and the Accused the same The Parties
being met and the People got together a grand Consultation was held
before they proceeded to Trial in which it was agreed to use the Scales
first and a Committee of Men were appointed to search the Men and a
Committee of Women to search the Women to see if they had any Thing of
Weight about them particularly Pins After the Scrutiny was over a huge
great Bible belonging to the Justice of the Place was provided and a
Lane through the Populace was made from the Justices House to the
Scales which were fixed on a Gallows erected for that Purpose opposite
to the House that the Justices Wife and the rest of the Ladies might
see the Trial without coming amongst the Mob and after the Manner of
Moorfields a large Ring was also made Then came out of the House a
grave tall Man carrying the Holy Writ before the supposed Wizard etc
as solemnly as the Swordbearer of London before the Lord Mayor the
Wizard was first put in the Scale and over him was read a Chapter out
of the Books of Moses and then the Bible was put in the other Scale
which being kept down before was immediately let go but to the
great Surprize of the Spectators Flesh and Bones came down plump and
outweighed that great good Book by abundance After the same Manner
the others were served and their Lumps of Mortality severally were too
heavy for Moses and all the Prophets and Apostles This being over the
Accusers and the rest of the Mob not satisfied with this Experiment
would have the Trial by Water Accordingly a most solemn Procession was
made to the Millpond where both Accused and Accusers being stripped
saving only to the Women their Shifts were bound Hand and Foot and
severally placed in the Water lengthways from the Side of a Barge or
Flat having for Security only a Rope about the Middle of each which
was held by some in the Flat The accused man being thin and spare with
some Difficulty began to sink at last but the rest every one of them
swam very light upon the Water A Sailor in the Flat jumpd out upon the
Back of the Man accused thinking to drive him down to the Bottom but
the Person bound without any Help came up some time before the other
The Woman Accuser being told that she did not sink would be duckd a
second Time when she swam again as light as before Upon which she
declared That she believed the Accused had bewitched her to make her so
light and that she would be duckd again a Hundred Times but she would
duck the Devil out of her The Accused Man being surprizd at his own
Swimming was not so confident of his Innocence as before but said If
I am a Witch it is more than I know The more thinking Part of the
Spectators were of Opinion that any Person so bound and placed in the
Water unless they were mere Skin and Bones would swim till their
Breath was gone and their Lungs filld with Water But it being the
general Belief of the Populace that the Womens shifts and the Garters
with which they were bound helpd to support them it is said they are
to be tried again the next warm Weather naked



AN APOLOGY FOR PRINTERS

From the Pennsylvania Gazette June  

Being frequently censurd and condemnd by different Persons for
printing Things which they say ought not to be printed I have sometimes
thought it might be necessary to make a standing Apology for my self
and publish it once a Year to be read upon all Occasions of that
Nature Much Business has hitherto hindered the execution of this
Design but having very lately given extraordinary Offence by printing
an Advertisement with a certain N B at the End of it I find an
Apology more particularly requisite at this Juncture tho it happens
when I have not yet Leisure to write such a Thing in the proper Form
and can only in a loose manner throw those Considerations together which
should have been the Substance of it

I request all who are angry with me on the Account of printing things
they dont like calmly to consider these following Particulars

 That the Opinions of Men are almost as various as their Faces an
Observation general enough to become a common Proverb So many Men so
many Minds

 That the Business of Printing has chiefly to do with Mens Opinions
most things that are printed tending to promote some or oppose others

 That hence arises the peculiar Unhappiness of that Business which
other Callings are no way liable to they who follow Printing being
scarce able to do any thing in their way of getting a Living which
shall not probably give Offence to some and perhaps to many whereas
the Smith the Shoemaker the Carpenter or the Man of any other Trade
may work indifferently for People of all Persuasions without offending
any of them and the Merchant may buy and sell with Jews Turks
Hereticks and Infidels of all sorts and get Money by every one of them
without giving Offence to the most orthodox of any sort or suffering
the least Censure or Ill will on the Account from any Man whatever

 That it is as unreasonable in any one Man or Set of Men to expect to
be pleasd with every thing that is printed as to think that nobody
ought to be pleasd but themselves

 Printers are educated in the Belief that when Men differ in Opinion
both Sides ought equally to have the Advantage of being heard by the
Publick and that when Truth and Error have fair Play the former is
always an overmatch for the latter Hence they chearfully serve all
contending Writers that pay them well without regarding on which side
they are of the Question in Dispute

 Being thus continually employd in serving both Parties Printers
naturally acquire a vast Unconcernedness as to the right or wrong
Opinions containd in what they print regarding it only as the Matter
of their daily labour They print things full of Spleen and Animosity
with the utmost Calmness and Indifference and without the least
Illwill to the Persons reflected on who nevertheless unjustly think
the Printer as much their Enemy as the Author and join both together in
their Resentment

 That it is unreasonable to imagine Printers approve of every thing
they print and to censure them on any particular thing accordingly
since in the way of their Business they print such great variety of
things opposite and contradictory It is likewise as unreasonable what
some assert That Printers ought not to print any Thing but what they
approve since if all of that Business should make such a Resolution
and abide by it an End would thereby be put to Free Writing and the
World would afterwards have nothing to read but what happend to be the
Opinions of Printers

 That if all Printers were determind not to print any thing till they
were sure it would offend no body there would be very little printed

 That if they sometimes print vicious or silly things not worth
reading it may not be because they approve such things themselves but
because the People are so viciously and corruptly educated that good
things are not encouraged I have known a very numerous Impression of
Robin Hoods Songs go off in this Province at s per Book in less than
a Twelvemonth when a small Quantity of Davids Psalms an excellent
Version have lain upon my Hands above twice the Time

 That notwithstanding what might be urgd in behalf of a Mans being
allowd to do in the Way of his Business whatever he is paid for yet
Printers do continually discourage the Printing of great Numbers of bad
things and stifle them in the Birth I my self have constantly refused
to print anything that might countenance Vice or promote Immorality
tho by complying in such Cases with the corrupt Taste of the Majority I
might have got much Money I have also always refusd to print such
things as might do real Injury to any Person how much soever I have
been solicited and tempted with Offers of Great Pay and how much
soever I have by refusing got the Illwill of those who would have
employd me I have hitherto fallen under the Resentment of large Bodies
of Men for refusing absolutely to print any of their Party or Personal
Reflections In this Manner I have made my self many Enemies and the
constant Fatigue of denying is almost insupportable But the Publick
being unacquainted with all this whenever the poor Printer happens
either through Ignorance or much Persuasion to do any thing that is
generally thought worthy of Blame he meets with no more Friendship or
Favour on the above Account than if there were no Merit int at all
Thus as Waller says

    Poets lose half the Praise they would have got
    Were it but known what they discreetly blot

Yet are censurd for every bad Line found in their Works with the utmost
Severity

I come now to the Particular Case of the N B above mentiond about
which there has been more Clamour against me than ever before on any
other AccountIn the Hurry of other Business an Advertisement was
brought to me to be printed it signified that such a Ship lying at such
a Wharff would sail for Barbadoes in such a Time and that Freighters
and Passengers might agree with the Captain at such a Place so far is
whats common But at the Bottom this odd Thing was added N B No Sea
Hens nor Black Gowns will be admitted on any Terms I printed it and
receivd my Money and the Advertisement was stuck up round the Town as
usual I had not so much Curiosity at that time as to enquire the
Meaning of it nor did I in the least imagine it would give so much
Offence Several good Men are very angry with me on this Occasion they
are pleasd to say I have too much Sense to do such things ignorantly
that if they were Printers they would not have done such a thing on any
Consideration that it could proceed from nothing but my abundant Malice
against Religion and the Clergy They therefore declare they will not
take any more of my Papers nor have any farther Dealings with me but
will hinder me of all the Custom they can All this is very hard

I believe it had been better if I had refused to print the said
Advertisement However tis done and cannot be revokd I have only
the following few Particulars to offer some of them in my behalf by
way of Mitigation and some not much to the Purpose but I desire none
of them may be read when the Reader is not in a very good Humour

 That I really did it without the least Malice and imagind the N B
was placd there only to make the Advertisement stard at and more
generally read

 That I never saw the Word SeaHens before in my Life nor have I yet
askd the meaning of it and tho I had certainly known that Black Gowns
in that place signified the Clergy of the Church of England yet I have
that confidence in the generous good Temper of such of them as I know
as to be well satisfied such a trifling mention of their Habit gives
them no Disturbance

 That most of the Clergy in this and the neighbouring Provinces are
my Customers and some of them my very good Friends and I must be very
malicious indeed or very stupid to print this thing for a small
Profit if I had thought it would have given them just Cause of Offence

 That if I had much Malice against the Clergy and withal much Sense
tis strange I never write or talk against the Clergy myself Some have
observed that tis a fruitful Topic and the easiest to be witty upon of
all others yet I appeal to the Publick that I am never guilty this way
and to all my Acquaintances as to my Conversation

 That if a Man of Sense had Malice enough to desire to injure the
Clergy this is the foolishest Thing he could possibly contrive for that
Purpose

 That I got Five Shillings by it

 That none who are angry with me would have given me so much to let it
alone

 That if all the People of different Opinions in this Province would
engage to give me as much for not printing things they dont like as I
can get by printing them I should probably live a very easy Life and
if all Printers were everywhere so dealt by there would be very little
printed

 That I am obligd to all who take my Paper and am willing to think
they do it out of meer Friendship I only desire they would think the
same when I deal with them I thank those who leave off that they have
taken it so long But I beg they would not endeavour to dissuade others
for that will look like Malice

 That tis impossible any Man should know what he would do if he was
a Printer

 That notwithstanding the Rashness and Inexperience of Youth which
is most likely to be prevaild with to do things that ought not to be
done yet I have avoided printing such Things as usually give Offence
either to Church or State more than any Printer that has followed the
Business in this Province before

 And lastly That I have printed above a Thousand Advertisements
which made not the least mention of SeaHens or Black Gowns and
this being the first Offence I have the more Reason to expect
Forgiveness

I take leave to conclude with an old Fable which some of my Readers
have heard before and some have not

    A certain wellmeaning Man and his Son were travelling
    towards a Market Town with an Ass which they had to sell
    The Road was bad and the old Man therefore rid but the Son
    went afoot The first Passenger they met asked the Father
    if he was not ashamed to ride by himself and suffer the
    poor Lad to wade along thro the Mire this induced him to
    take up his Son behind him He had not travelled far when
    he met others who said they are two unmerciful Lubbers to
    get both on the Back of that poor Ass in such a deep Road
    Upon this the old Man gets off and let his Son ride alone
    The next they met called the Lad a graceless rascally young
    Jackanapes to ride in that Manner thro the Dirt while his
    aged Father trudged along on Foot and they said the old Man
    was a Fool for suffering it He then bid his Son come down
    and walk with him and they travelld on leading the Ass by
    the Halter till they met another Company who called them
    a Couple of senseless Blockheads for going both on Foot in
    such a dirty Way when they had an empty Ass with them
    which they might ride upon The old Man could bear no
    longer My Son said he it grieves me much that we cannot
    please all these People Let me throw the Ass over the next
    Bridge and be no further troubled with him

Had the old Man been seen acting this last Resolution he would probably
have been called a Fool for troubling himself about the different
Opinions of all that were pleasd to find Fault with him Therefore
tho I have a Temper almost as complying as his I intend not to imitate
him in this last Particular I consider the Variety of Humors among Men
and despair of pleasing every Body yet I shall not therefore leave off
Printing I shall continue my Business I shall not burn my Press and
melt my Letters



PREFACE TO POOR RICHARD 

COURTEOUS READER

I might in this place attempt to gain thy Favour by declaring that I
write Almanacks with no other View than that of the publick Good but in
this I should not be sincere and Men are now adays too wise to be
deceivd by Pretences how specious soever The plain Truth of the Matter
is I am excessive poor and my Wife good Woman is I tell her
excessive proud she cannot bear she says to sit spinning in her Shift
of Tow while I do nothing but gaze at the Stars and has threatned more
than once to burn all my Books and RattlingTraps as she calls my
Instruments if I do not make some profitable Use of them for the Good
of my Family The Printer has offerd me some considerable share of the
Profits and I have thus begun to comply with my Dames Desire

Indeed this Motive would have had Force enough to have made me publish
an Almanack many Years since had it not been overpowered by my Regard
for my good Friend and Fellow Student Mr Titan Leeds whose Interest
I was extreamly unwilling to hurt But this Obstacle I am far from
speaking it with Pleasure is soon to be removed since inexorable
Death who was never known to respect Merit has already prepared the
mortal Dart the fatal Sister has already extended her destroying
Shears and that ingenious Man must soon be taken from us He dies by
my Calculation made at his Request on Oct    h  m P M
at the very instant of the  of  and  By his own Calculation he will
survive till the th of the same Month This small Difference
between us we have disputed whenever we have met these  Years past but
at length he is inclinable to agree with my Judgment Which of us is
most exact a little Time will now determine As therefore these
Provinces may not longer expect to see any of his Performances after
this Year I think my self free to take up the Task and request a share
of the publick Encouragement which I am the more apt to hope for on
this Account that the Buyer of my Almanack may consider himself not
only as purchasing an useful Utensil but as performing an Act of
Charity to his poor Friend and Servant

A MEDITATION ON A QUART MUGG

From the Pennsylvania Gazette July  

Wretched miserable and unhappy Mug I pity thy luckless Lot I
commiserate thy Misfortunes thy Griefs fill me with Compassion and
because of thee are Tears made frequently to burst from my Eyes

How often have I seen him compelld to hold up his Handle at the Bar
for no other Crime than that of being empty then snatchd away by a
surly Officer and plungd suddenly into a Tub of cold Water Sad
Spectacle and Emblem of human Penury oppressd by arbitrary Power How
often is he hurryd down into a dismal Vault sent up fully laden in a
cold Sweat and by a rude Hand thrust into the Fire How often have I
seen it obliged to undergo the Indignities of a dirty Wench to have
melting Candles dropt on its naked Sides and sometimes in its Mouth to
risque being broken into a thousand Pieces for Actions which itself was
not guilty of How often is he forced into the Company of boisterous
Sots who lay all their nonsence Noise profane Swearing Cursing and
Quarreling on the harmless Mug which speaks not a Word They overset
him maim him and sometimes turn him to Arms offensive or defensive as
they please when of himself he would not be of either Party but would
as willingly stand still Alas what Power or Place is provided where
this poor Mug this unpitied Slave can have Redress of his Wrongs and
Sufferings Or where shall he have a Word of Praise bestowd on him for
his Well doings and faithful Services If he prove of a large size his
Owner curses him and says he will devour more than hell earn If his
Size be small those whom his Master appoints him to serve will curse
him as much and perhaps threaten him with the Inquisition of the
Standard Poor Mug unfortunate is thy Condition Of thy self thou
wouldst do no Harm but much Harm is done with thee Thou art accused of
many Mischiefs thou art said to administer Drunkenness Poison and
broken Heads But none praise thee for the good Things thou yieldest
Shouldest thou produce double Beer nappy Ale stallcop Cyder or Cyder
mulld fine Punch or cordial Tiff yet for all these shouldst thou not
be praisd but the rich Liquors themselves which tho within thee
will be said to be foreign to thee And yet so unhappy is thy Destiny
thou must bear all their Faults and Abominations Hast thou been
industriously serving thy Employers with Tiff or Punch and instantly
they dispatch thee for Cyder then must thou be abused for smelling of
Rum Hast thou been steaming their Noses gratefully with mulld Cyder
or butterd Ale and then offerest to refresh their Palates with the
best of Beer they will curse thee for thy Greasiness And how alas
can thy Service be rendered more tolerable to thee If thou submittest
thyself to a Scouring in the Kitchen what must thou undergo from sharp
Sand hot Ashes and a coarse Dishclout besides the Danger of having
thy Lips rudely torn thy Countenance disfigured thy Arms dismantled
and thy whole Frame shatterd with violent Concussions in an Iron Pot
or Brass Kettle And yet O Mug if these Dangers thou escapest with
little Injury thou must at last untimely fall be broken to Pieces and
cast away never more to be recollected and formd into a Quart Mug
Whether by the Fire or in a Battle or choakd with a Dishclout or by
a Stroke against a Stone thy Dissolution happens tis all alike to thy
avaritious Owner he grieves not for thee but for the Shilling with
which he purchased thee If thy Bottom Part should chance to survive it
may be preservd to hold bits of Candles or Blacking for Shoes or
Salve for kibed Heels but all thy other Members will be for ever buried
in some miry Hole or less carefully disposed of so that little
Children who have not yet arrived to Acts of Cruelty may gather them
up to furnish out their Baby Houses Or being cast upon the Dunghill
they will therewith be carted into Meadow Grounds where being spread
abroad and discovered they must be thrown to the Heap of Stones Bones
and Rubbish or being left until the Mower finds them with his Scythe
they will with bitter Curses be tossed over the Hedge and so serve for
unlucky Boys to throw at Birds and Dogs until by Length of Time and
numerous Casualties they shall be pressd into their Mother Earth and
be converted to their original Principles

COURTEOUS READERS

Your kind and charitable Assistance last Year in purchasing so large an
Impression of my Almanacks has made my Circumstances much more easy in
the World and requires my grateful Acknowledgment My Wife has been
enabled to get a Pot of her own and is no longer obligd to borrow one
from a Neighbour nor have we ever since been without something of our
own to put in it She has also got a pair of Shoes two new Shifts and
a new warm Petticoat and for my part I have bought a secondhand Coat
so good that I am now not ashamd to go to Town or be seen there These
Things have renderd her Temper so much more pacifick than it usd to
be that I may say I have slept more and more quietly within this last
Year than in the three foregoing Years put together Accept my hearty
Thanks therefor and my sincere Wishes for your Health and Prosperity

In the Preface to my last Almanack I foretold the Death of my dear old
Friend and FellowStudent the learned and ingenious Mr Titan Leeds
which was to be on the th of October   h  m P M at the
very Instant of the  of  and  By his own Calculation he was to
survive till the th of the same Month and expire in the Time of the
Eclipse near  oclock A M At which of these Times he died or
whether he be really yet dead I cannot at this present Writing
positively assure my Readers forasmuch as a Disorder in my own Family
demanded my Presence and would not permit me as I had intended to be
with him in his last Moments to receive his last Embrace to close his
Eyes and do the Duty of a Friend in performing the last Offices to the
Departed Therefore it is that I cannot positively affirm whether he be
dead or not for the Stars only show to the Skilful what will happen in
the natural and universal Chain of Causes and Effects but tis well
known that the Events which would otherwise certainly happen at certain
Times in the Course of Nature are sometimes set aside or postpond for
wise and good Reasons by the immediate particular Dispositions of
Providence which particular Dispositions the Stars can by no Means
discover or foreshow There is however and I cannot speak it without
Sorrow there is the strongest Probability that my dear Friend is no
more for there appears in his Name as I am assured an Almanack for
the Year  in which I am treated in a very gross and unhandsome
Manner in which I am called a false Predicter an Ignorant a
conceited Scribler a Fool and a Lyar Mr Leeds was too well bred
to use any Man so indecently and so scurrilously and moreover his
Esteem and Affection for me was extraordinary So that it is to be
feared that Pamphlet may be only a Contrivance of somebody or other who
hopes perhaps to sell two or three Years Almanacks still by the sole
Force and Virtue of Mr Leedss Name but certainly to put Words
into the Mouth of a Gentleman and a Man of Letters against his Friend
which the meanest and most scandalous of the People might be ashamd to
utter even in a drunken Quarrel is an unpardonable Injury to his
Memory and an Imposition upon the Publick

Mr Leeds was not only profoundly skilful in the useful Science he
professd but he was a Man of exemplary Sobriety a most sincere
Friend and an exact Performer of his Word These valuable
Qualifications with many others so much endeard him to me that
although it should be so that contrary to all Probability contrary to
my Prediction and his own he might possibly be yet alive yet my Loss
of Honour as a Prognosticator cannot afford me so much Mortification
as his Life Health and Safety would give me Joy and Satisfaction

I am Courteous and Kind Reader

PREFACE TO POOR RICHARD 

COURTEOUS READER

This is the third Time of my appearing in print hitherto very much to
my own Satisfaction and I have reason to hope to the Satisfaction of
the Publick also for the Publick is generous and has been very
charitable and good to me I should be ungrateful then if I did not
take every Opportunity of expressing my Gratitude for ingratum si
dixeris omnia dixeris I therefore return the Publick my most humble
and hearty Thanks

Whatever may be the Musick of the Spheres how great soever the Harmony
of the Stars tis certain there is no Harmony among the Stargazers but
they are perpetually growling and snarling at one another like strange
Curs or like some Men at their Wives I had resolved to keep the Peace
on my own part and affront none of them and I shall persist in that
Resolution But having receivd much Abuse from Titan Leeds deceasd
Titan Leeds when living would not have usd me so I say having
receivd much Abuse from the Ghost of Titan Leeds who pretends to be
still living and to write Almanacks in Spight of me and my Predictions
I cannot help saying that tho I take it patiently I take it very
unkindly And whatever he may pretend tis undoubtedly true that he is
really defunct and dead First because the Stars are seldom
disappointed never but in the Case of wise Men sapiens dominabitur
astris and they foreshowd his Death at the Time I predicted it
Secondly Twas requisite and necessary he should die punctually at that
Time for the Honour of Astrology the Art professed both by him and his
Father before him Thirdly Tis plain to every one that reads his last
two Almanacks for  and  that they are not written with that
Life his Performances use to be written with the Wit is low and flat
the little Hints dull and spiritless nothing smart in them but
Hudibrass Verses against Astrology at the Heads of the Months in the
last which no Astrologer but a dead one would have inserted and no
Man living would or could write such Stuff as the rest But lastly I
convince him in his own Words that he is dead ex ore suo condemnatus
est for in his Preface to his Almanack for  he says Saunders
adds another GROSS FALSHOOD in his Almanack viz that by my own
Calculation I shall survive until the th of the said Month October
 which is as untrue as the former Now if it be as Leeds says
untrue and a gross Falshood that he survivd till the th of
October  then it is certainly true that he died before that
Time And if he died before that Time he is dead now to all Intents
and Purposes any thing he may say to the contrary notwithstanding And
at what Time before the th is it so likely he should die as at the
Time by me predicted viz the th of October aforesaid But if some
People will walk and be troublesome after Death it may perhaps be born
with a little because it cannot well be avoided unless one would be at
the Pains and Expence of laying them in the Red Sea however they
should not presume too much upon the Liberty allowd them I know
Confinement must needs be mighty irksome to the free Spirit of an
Astronomer and I am too compassionate to proceed suddenly to
Extremities with it nevertheless tho I resolve with Reluctance I
shall not long defer if it does not speedily learn to treat its living
Friends with better Manners

HINTS FOR THOSE THAT WOULD BE RICH

October From Poor Richard 

The Use of Money is all the Advantage there is in having Money

For  a Year you may have the Use of  if you are a Man of known
Prudence and Honesty

He that spends a Groat a day idly spends idly above  a year which is
the Price of using 

He that wastes idly a Groats worth of his Time per Day one Day with
another wastes the Privilege of using  each Day

He that idly loses s worth of time loses s and might as prudently
throw s in the River

He that loses s not only loses that Sum but all the Advantage that
might be made by turning it in Dealing which by the time that a young
Man becomes old amounts to a comfortable Bag of Money

Again He that sells upon Credit asks a Price for what he sells
equivalent to the Principal and Interest of his Money for the Time he is
like to be kept out of it therefore He that buys upon Credit pays
Interest for what he buys And he that pays ready Money might let that
Money out to Use so that He that possesses any Thing he has bought
pays Interest for the Use of it

Consider then when you are tempted to buy any unnecessary
Householdstuff or any superfluous thing whether you will be willing to
pay Interest and Interest upon Interest for it as long as you live
and more if it grows worse by using

Yet in buying goods tis best to pay Ready Money because He that
sells upon Credit expects to lose  per Cent by bad Debts therefore
he charges on all he sells upon Credit an Advance that shall make up
for that Deficiency

Those who pay for what they buy upon Credit pay their Share of this
Advance

He that pays ready Money escapes or may escape that Charge

    A Penny savd is Twopence clear
    A Pin a Day is a Groat a Year



TO JOSIAH FRANKLIN

                                    Philadelphia April  

HONOURED FATHER

I have your favours of the st of March in which you both seem
concerned lest I have imbibed some erroneous opinions Doubtless I have
my share and when the natural weakness and imperfection of human
understanding is considered the unavoidable influence of education
custom books and company upon our ways of thinking I imagine a man
must have a good deal of vanity who believes and a good deal of
boldness who affirms that all the doctrines he holds are true and all
he rejects are false And perhaps the same may be justly said of every
sect church and society of men when they assume to themselves that
infallibility which they deny to the Pope and councils

I think opinions should be judged of by their influences and effects
and if a man holds none that tend to make him less virtuous or more
vicious it may be concluded he holds none that are dangerous which I
hope is the case with me

I am sorry you should have any uneasiness on my account and if it were
a thing possible for one to alter his opinions in order to please
another I know none whom I ought more willingly to oblige in that
respect than yourselves But since it is no more in a mans power to
think than to look like another methinks all that should be
expected from me is to keep my mind open to conviction to hear
patiently and examine attentively whatever is offered me for that end
and if after all I continue in the same errors I believe your usual
charity will induce you to rather pity and excuse than blame me In the
mean time your care and concern for me is what I am very thankful for

My mother grieves that one of her sons is an Arian another an
Arminian What an Arminian or an Arian is I cannot say that I very well
know The truth is I make such distinctions very little my study I
think vital religion has always suffered when orthodoxy is more
regarded than virtue and the Scriptures assure me that at the last day
we shall not be examined what we thought but what we did and our
recommendation will not be that we said Lord Lord but that we did
good to our fellow creatures See Matt xxv

As to the freemasons I know no way of giving my mother a better account
of them than she seems to have at present since it is not allowed that
women should be admitted into that secret society She has I must
confess on that account some reason to be displeased with it but for
any thing else I must entreat her to suspend her judgment till she is
better informed unless she will believe me when I assure her that they
are in general a very harmless sort of people and have no principles or
practices that are inconsistent with religion and good manners

We have had great rains here lately which with the thawing of snow on
the mountains back of our country have made vast floods in our rivers
and by carrying away bridges boats c made travelling almost
impracticable for a week past so that our post has entirely missed
making one trip

I hear nothing of Dr Crook nor can I learn any such person has ever
been here

I hope my sister Jennys child is by this time recovered I am your
dutiful son

PREFACE TO POOR RICHARD 

KIND READER

Encouraged by thy former Generosity I once more present thee with an
Almanack which is the th of my Publication While thou art putting
Pence in my Pocket and furnishing my Cottage with necessaries Poor
Dick is not unmindful to do something for thy Benefit The Stars are
watchd as narrowly as old Bess watchd her Daughter that thou mayst
be acquainted with their Motions and told a Tale of their Influences
and Effects which may do thee more good than a Dream of last Years
Snow

Ignorant Men wonder how we Astrologers foretell the Weather so exactly
unless we deal with the old black Devil Alas tis as easy as 
For Instance The Stargazer peeps at the Heavens thro a long Glass He
sees perhaps TAURUS or the great Bull in a mighty Chafe stamping on
the Floor of his House swinging his Tail about stretching out his
Neck and opening wide his Mouth Tis natural from these Appearances to
judge that this furious Bull is puffing blowing and roaring Distance
being considerd and Time allowd for all this to come down there you
have Wind and Thunder He spies perhaps VIRGO or the Virgin she turns
her Head round as it were to see if any body observd her then
crouching down gently with her Hands on her Knees she looks wistfully
for a while right forward He judges rightly what shes about And
having calculated the Distance and allowd Time for its Falling finds
that next Spring we shall have a fine April shower What can be more
natural and easy than this I might instance the like in many other
particulars but this may be sufficient to prevent our being taken for
Conjurors O the wonderful Knowledge to be found in the Stars Even the
smallest Things are written there if you had but Skill to read When my
Brother Jmn erected a Scheme to know which was best for his sick
Horse to sup a newlaid Egg or a little Broth he found that the Stars
plainly gave their Verdict for Broth and the Horse having supd his
BrothNow what do you think became of that Horse You shall know in
my next

Besides the usual Things expected in an Almanack I hope the professd
Teachers of Mankind will excuse my scattering here and there some
instructive Hints in Matters of Morality and Religion And be not thou
disturbed O grave and sober Reader if among the many serious Sentences
in my Book thou findest me trifling now and then and talking idly In
all the Dishes I have hitherto cookd for thee there is solid Meat
enough for thy Money There are Scraps from the Table of Wisdom that
will if well digested yield strong Nourishment to thy Mind But
squeamish Stomachs cannot eat without Pickles which tis true are good
for nothing else but they provoke an Appetite The Vain Youth that
reads my Almanack for the sake of an idle Joke will perhaps meet with a
serious Reflection that he may ever after be the better for

Some People observing the great Yearly Demand for my Almanack imagine I
must by this Time have become rich and consequently ought to call
myself Poor Dick no longer But the Case is this

When I first begun to publish the Printer made a fair Agreement with me
for my Copies by Virtue of which he runs away with the greatest Part of
the ProfitHowever much good mayt do him I do not grudge it him he
is a Man I have a great Regard for and I wish his Profit ten times
greater than it is For I am dear Reader his as well as thy

A PROPOSAL

FOR PROMOTING USEFUL KNOWLEDGE AMONG THE BRITISH PLANTATIONS IN AMERICA

                                      Philadelphia May  

The English are possessed of a long tract of continent from Nova Scotia
to Georgia extending north and south through different climates having
different soils producing different plants mines and minerals and
capable of different improvements manufactures c

The first drudgery of settling new colonies which confines the
attention of people to mere necessaries is now pretty well over and
there are many in every province in circumstances that set them at ease
and afford leisure to cultivate the finer arts and improve the common
stock of knowledge To such of these who are men of speculation many
hints must from time to time arise many observations occur which if
well examined pursued and improved might produce discoveries to the
advantage of some or all of the British plantations or to the benefit
of mankind in general

But as from the extent of the country such persons are widely separated
and seldom can see and converse or be acquainted with each other so
that many useful particulars remain uncommunicated die with the
discoverers and are lost to mankind it is to remedy this
inconvenience for the future proposed

    That one society be formed of virtuosi or ingenious men
    residing in the several colonies to be called The American
    Philosophical Society who are to maintain a constant
    correspondence

    That Philadelphia being the city nearest the centre of the
    continent colonies communicating with all of them northward
    and southward by post and with all the islands by sea and
    having the advantage of a good growing library be the centre
    of the Society

    That at Philadelphia there be always at least seven members
    viz a physician a botanist a mathematician a chemist a
    mechanician a geographer and a general natural philosopher
    besides a president treasurer and secretary

    That these members meet once a month or oftener at their
    own expense to communicate to each other their observations
    and experiments to receive read and consider such letters
    communications or queries as shall be sent from distant
    members to direct the dispersing of copies of such
    communications as are valuable to other distant members in
    order to procure their sentiments thereupon

    That the subjects of the correspondence be all
    newdiscovered plants herbs trees roots their virtues
    uses c methods of propagating them and making such as
    are useful but particular to some plantations more general
    improvements of vegetable juices as ciders wines c new
    methods of curing or preventing diseases all newdiscovered
    fossils in different countries as mines minerals and
    quarries new and useful improvements in any branch of
    mathematics new discoveries in chemistry such as
    improvements in distillation brewing and assaying of ores
    new mechanical inventions for saving labour as mills and
    carriages and for raising and conveying of water draining
    of meadows c all new arts trades and manufactures that
    may be proposed or thought of surveys maps and charts of
    particular parts of the seacoasts or inland countries
    course and junction of rivers and great roads situation of
    lakes and mountains nature of the soil and productions new
    methods of improving the breed of useful animals introducing
    other sorts from foreign countries new improvements in
    planting gardening and clearing land and all philosophical
    experiments that let light into the nature of things tend to
    increase the power of man over matter and multiply the
    conveniences or pleasures of life

    That a correspondence already begun by some intended
    members shall be kept up by this Society with the ROYAL
    SOCIETY of London and with the DUBLIN SOCIETY

    That every member shall have abstracts sent him quarterly of
    every thing valuable communicated to the Societys Secretary
    at Philadelphia free of all charge except the yearly payment
    hereafter mentioned

    That by permission of the postmastergeneral such
    communications pass between the Secretary of the Society and
    the members postagefree

    That for defraying the expense of such experiments as the
    Society shall judge proper to cause to be made and other
    contingent charges for the common good every member send a
    piece of eight per annum to the treasurer at Philadelphia
    to form a common stock to be disbursed by order of the
    President with the consent of the majority of the members
    that can conveniently be consulted thereupon to such persons
    and places where and by whom the experiments are to be made
    and otherwise as there shall be occasion of which
    disbursements an exact account shall be kept and
    communicated yearly to every member

    That at the first meetings of the members at Philadelphia
    such rules be formed for regulating their meetings and
    transactions for the general benefit as shall be convenient
    and necessary to be afterwards changed and improved as there
    shall be occasion wherein due regard is to be had to the
    advice of distant members

    That at the end of every year collections be made and
    printed of such experiments discoveries and improvements
    as may be thought of public advantage and that every member
    have a copy sent him

    That the business and duty of the Secretary be to receive all
    letters intended for the Society and lay them before the
    President and members at their meetings to abstract
    correct and methodize such papers as require it and as he
    shall be directed to do by the President after they have
    been considered debated and digested in the Society to
    enter copies thereof in the Societys books and make out
    copies for distant members to answer their letters by
    direction of the President and keep records of all material
    transactions of the Society

Benjamin Franklin the writer of this Proposal offers himself to serve
the Society as their secretary till they shall be provided with one
more capable



SHAVERS AND TRIMMERS

From the Pennsylvania Gazette June  

Alexander Miller Perukemaker in Secondstreet Philadelphia takes
Opportunity to acquaint his Customers that he intends to leave off the
Shaving Business after the d of August next


TO MR FRANKLIN

Sir

It is a common Observation among the People of Great Britain and
Ireland that the Barbers are reverenced by the lower Classes of the
Inhabitants of those Kingdoms and in the more remote Parts of those
Dominions as the sole Oracles of Wisdom and Politicks This at first
View seems to be owing to the odd Bent of Mind and peculiar Humour of
the People of those Nations But if we carry this Observation into other
Parts we shall find the same Passion equally prevalent throughout the
whole civilized World and discover in every little MarketTown and
Village the Squire the Exciseman and even the Parson himself
listening with as much Attention to a Barbers News as they would to
the profound Revelations of a Chancellor of the Exchequer or principal
Secretary of State

Antiquity likewise will furnish us with many Confirmations of the Truth
of what I have here asserted Among the old Romans the Barbers were
understood to be exactly of the same Complection I have here described
I shall not trouble your Readers with a Multitude of Examples taken from
Antiquity I shall only quote one Passage in Horace which may serve
to illustrate the Whole and is as follows

    Strenuus et fortis causisq Philippus agendis
    Clarus ab officiis octavam circiter horam
    Dum redit atq foro nimium distare carinas
    Jam grandis natu queritur conspexit ut aiunt
    Adrasum quendam vacu tonsoris in umbr
    Cultello proprios purgantem leniter ungues
                               Hor Epist Lib I 

By which we may understand that the Tonsoris Umbra or Barbers Shop
was the common Rendezvous of every idle Fellow who had no more to do
than to pair his Nails talk Politicks and see and to be seen

But to return to the Point in Question If we would know why the Barbers
are so eminent for their Skill in Politicks it will be necessary to lay
aside the Appellation of Barber and confine ourselves to that of Shaver
and Trimmer which will naturally lead us to consider the near Relation
which subsists between Shaving Trimming and Politicks from whence we
shall discover that Shaving and Trimming is not the Province of the
Mechanic alone but that there are their several Shavers and Trimmers at
Court the Bar in Church and State

And first Shaving or Trimming in a strict mechanical Sense of the
Word signifies a cutting sheering lopping off and fleecing us of
those Excrescencies of Hair Nails Flesh c which burthen and
disguise our natural Endowments And is not the same practised over the
whole World by Men of every Rank and Station Does not the corrupt
Minister lop off our Privileges and fleece us of our Money Do not the
Gentlemen of the long Robe find means to cut off those Excrescencies of
the Nation Highwaymen Thieves and Robbers And to look into the
Church who has been more notorious for shaving and fleecing than that
Apostle of Apostles that Preacher of Preachers the Rev Mr G W
But I forbear making farther mention of this spiritual Shaver and
Trimmer lest I should affect the Minds of my Readers as deeply as his
Preaching has affected their Pockets

The second Species of Shavers and Trimmers are those who according to
the English Phrase make the best of a bad Market Such as cover
what is called by an eminent Preacher their poor Dust in tinsel
Cloaths and gaudy Plumes of Feathers A Star and Garter for Instance
adds Grace Dignity and Lustre to a gross corpulent Body and a
competent Share of religious Horror thrown into the Countenance with
proper Distortions of the Face and the Addition of a lank Head of Hair
or a long Wig and Band commands a most profound Respect to Insolence
and Ignorance The Pageantry of the Church of Rome is too well known
for me to instance It will not however be amiss to observe that his
Holiness the Pope when he has a Mind to fleece his Flock of a good
round Sum sets off the Matter with Briefs Pardons Indulgencies c
c c

The Third and last Kind of Shavers and Trimmers are those who in
Scripture Language are carried away with every Wind of Doctrine The
Vicars of Bray and those who exchange their Principles with the Times
may justly be referred to this Class But the most odious Shavers and
Trimmers of this Kind are a certain set of Females called by the
polite World JILTS I cannot give my Readers a more perfect Idea of
these than by quoting the following Lines of the Poet

    Fatally fair they are and in their Smiles
    The Graces little Loves and young Desires inhabit
    But they are false luxurious in their Appetites
    And all the Heavn they hope for is Variety
    One Lover to another still succeeds
    Another and another after that
    And the last Fool is welcome as the former
    Till having lovd his Hour out he gives his Place
    And mingles with the Herd that went before him
                                   Rowes Fair Penitent

Lastly I cannot but congratulate my Neighbours on the little Favour
which is shown to Shavers and Trimmers by the People of this Province
The Business is at so low an Ebb that the worthy Gentleman whose
Advertisement I have chosen for the Motto of my Paper acquaints us he
will leave it off after the d of August next I am of Opinion that
all possible Encouragement ought to be given to Examples of this Kind
since it is owing to this that so perfect an Understanding is cultivated
among ourselves and the Chain of Friendship is brightened and
perpetuated with our good Allies the Indians The Antipathy which
these sage Naturalists bear to Shaving and Trimming is well known

From the Pennsylvania Gazette June  

My Paper on Shavers and Trimmers in the last Gazette being generally
condemnd I at first imputed it to the Want of Taste and Relish for
Pieces of that Force and Beauty which none but Universitybred
Gentlemen can produce But upon Advice of Friends whose Judgment I
could depend on I examined myself and to my Shame must confess that
I found myself to be an uncircumcised Jew whose Excrescencies of Hair
Nails Flesh c did burthen and disguise my Natural Endowments but
having my Hair and Nails since loppd off and shorn and my fleshly
Excrescencies circumcised I now appear in my wonted Lustre and expect
a speedy Admission among the Levites which I have already the Honour
of among the Poets and Natural Philosophers I have one Thing more to
add which is That I had no real Animosity against the Person whose
Advertisement I made the Motto of my Paper but as may appear to all
who have been Big with Pieces of this Kind what I had long on my Mind
I at last unburdend myself of O these JILTS still run in my Mind

N B The Publick perhaps may suppose this Confession forced upon me
but if they repair to the P Pe in Secondstreet they may see Me
or the Original hereof under my own Hand and be convinced that this is
genuine



PREFACE TO LOGANS TRANSLATION OF CATO MAJOR

The Printer to the Reader

This Version of Ciceros Tract de Senectute was made Ten Years since
by the Honourable and Learned Mr Logan of this City undertaken partly
for his own Amusement being then in his th Year which is said to be
nearly the Age of the Author when he wrote it but principally for the
Entertainment of a Neighbour then in his grand Climacteric and the
Notes were drawn up solely on that Neighbours Account who was not so
well acquainted as himself with the Roman History and Language Some
other Friends however among whom I had the Honour to be ranked
obtained Copies of it in MS And as I believed it to be in itself equal
at least if not far preferable to any other Translation of the same
Piece extant in our Language besides the Advantage it has of so many
valuable Notes which at the same time they clear up the Text are
highly instructive and entertaining I resolved to give it an
Impression being confident that the Publick would not unfavourably
receive it

A certain Freedman of Ciceros is reported to have said of a
medicinal Well discovered in his Time wonderful for the Virtue of its
Waters in restoring Sight to the Aged That it was a Gift of the
bountiful Gods to Men to the end that all might now have the Pleasure
of reading his Masters Works As that Well if still in being is at
too great a Distance for our Use I have Gentle Reader as thou
seest printed this Piece of Ciceros in a large and fair Character
that those who begin to think on the Subject of Old Age which seldom
happens till their Sight is somewhat impaird by its Approaches may
not in Reading by the Pain small Letters give the Eyes feel the
Pleasure of the Mind in the least allayed

I shall add to these few Lines my hearty Wish that this first
Translation of a Classic in this Western World may be followed with
many others performed with equal Judgment and Success and be a happy
Omen that Philadelphia shall become the Seat of the American Muses

TO JOHN FRANKLIN AT BOSTON

                                   Philadelphia March  

Our people are extremely impatient to hear of your success at Cape
Breton My shop is filled with thirty inquirers at the coming in of
every post Some wonder the place is not yet taken I tell them I shall
be glad to hear that news three months hence Fortified towns are hard
nuts to crack and your teeth have not been accustomed to it Taking
strong places is a particular trade which you have taken up without
serving an apprenticeship to it Armies and veterans need skilful
engineers to direct them in their attack Have you any But some seem
to think forts are as easy taken as snuff Father Moodys prayers look
tolerably modest You have a fast and prayer day for that purpose in
which I compute five hundred thousand petitions were offered up to the
same effect in New England which added to the petitions of every family
morning and evening multiplied by the number of days since January
th make fortyfive millions of prayers which set against the
prayers of a few priests in the garrison to the Virgin Mary give a
vast balance in your favour

If you do not succeed I fear I shall have but an indifferent opinion of
Presbyterian prayers in such cases as long as I live Indeed in
attacking strong towns I should have more dependence on works than on
faith for like the kingdom of heaven they are to be taken by force
and violence and in a French garrison I suppose there are devils of
that kind that they are not to be cast out by prayers and fasting
unless it be by their own fasting for want of provisions I believe
there is Scripture in what I have wrote but I cannot adorn the margin
with quotations having a bad memory and no Concordance at hand
besides no more time than to subscribe myself c

THE SPEECH OF POLLY BAKER

Printed in the Gentlemans Magazine April 

The Speech of Miss Polly Baker before a Court of Judicature at
Connecticut near Boston in New England where she was prosecuted the
fifth time for having a Bastard Child Which influenced the Court to
dispense with her Punishment and which induced one of her Judges to
marry her the next Dayby whom she had fifteen Children

    May it please the honourable bench to indulge me in a few
    words I am a poor unhappy woman who have no money to fee
    lawyers to plead for me being hard put to it to get a
    living I shall not trouble your honours with long speeches
    for I have not the presumption to expect that you may by any
    means be prevailed on to deviate in your Sentence from the
    law in my favour All I humbly hope is that your honours
    would charitably move the governors goodness on my behalf
    that my fine may be remitted This is the fifth time
    gentlemen that I have been draggd before your court on the
    same account twice I have paid heavy fines and twice have
    been brought to publick punishment for want of money to pay
    those fines This may have been agreeable to the laws and I
    dont dispute it but since laws are sometimes unreasonable
    in themselves and therefore repealed and others bear too
    hard on the subject in particular circumstances and
    therefore there is left a power somewhere to dispense with
    the execution of them I take the liberty to say that I
    think this law by which I am punished both unreasonable in
    itself and particularly severe with regard to me who have
    always lived an inoffensive life in the neighbourhood where I
    was born and defy my enemies if I have any to say I ever
    wrongd any man woman or child Abstracted from the law I
    cannot conceive may it please your honours what the nature
    of my offense is I have brought five fine children into the
    world at the risque of my life I have maintaind them well
    by my own industry without burthening the township and
    would have done it better if it had not been for the heavy
    charges and fines I have paid Can it be a crime in the
    nature of things I mean to add to the kings subjects in a
    new country that really wants people I own it I should
    think it rather a praiseworthy than a punishable action I
    have debauched no other womans husband nor enticed any
    other youth these things I never was chargd with nor has
    any one the least cause of complaint against me unless
    perhaps the ministers of justice because I have had
    children without being married by which they have missed a
    wedding fee But can this be a fault of mine I appeal to
    your honours You are pleased to allow I dont want sense
    but I must be stupified to the last degree not to prefer
    the honourable state of wedlock to the condition I have lived
    in I always was and still am willing to enter into it and
    doubt not my behaving well in it having all the industry
    frugality fertility and skill in economy appertaining to a
    good wifes character I defy any one to say I ever refused
    an offer of that sort on the contrary I readily consented
    to the only proposal of marriage that ever was made me which
    was when I was a virgin but too easily confiding in the
    persons sincerity that made it I unhappily lost my honour
    by trusting to his for he got me with child and then
    forsook me

    That very person you all know he is now become a
    magistrate of this country and I had hopes he would have
    appeared this day on the bench and have endeavoured to
    moderate the Court in my favour then I should have scornd
    to have mentioned it but I must now complain of it as
    unjust and unequal that my betrayer and undoer the first
    cause of all my faults and miscarriages if they must be
    deemed such should be advanced to honour and power in this
    government that punishes my misfortunes with stripes and
    infamy I should be told tis like that were there no act
    of Assembly in the case the precepts of religion are
    violated by my transgressions If mine is a religious
    offense leave it to religious punishments You have already
    excluded me from the comforts of your church communion Is
    not that sufficient You believe I have offended heaven and
    must suffer eternal fire Will not that be sufficient What
    need is there then of your additional fines and whipping I
    own I do not think as you do for if I thought what you call
    a sin was really such I could not presumptuously commit it
    But how can it be believed that heaven is angry at my having
    children when to the little done by me towards it God has
    been pleased to add his divine skill and admirable
    workmanship in the formation of their bodies and crowned the
    whole by furnishing them with rational and immortal souls

    Forgive me gentlemen if I talk a little extravagantly on
    these matters I am no divine but if you gentlemen must be
    making laws do not turn natural and useful actions into
    crimes by your prohibitions But take into your wise
    consideration the great and growing number of batchelors in
    the country many of whom from the mean fear of the expences
    of a family have never sincerely and honourably courted a
    woman in their lives and by their manner of living leave
    unproduced which is little better than murder hundreds of
    their posterity to the thousandth generation Is not this a
    greater offense against the publick good than mine Compel
    them then by law either to marriage or to pay double the
    fine of fornication every year What must poor young women
    do whom customs and nature forbid to solicit the men and
    who cannot force themselves upon husbands when the laws take
    no care to provide them any and yet severely punish them if
    they do their duty without them the duty of the first and
    great command of nature and natures God encrease and
    multiply a duty from the steady performance of which
    nothing has been able to deter me but for its sake I have
    hazarded the loss of the publick esteem and have frequently
    endured publick disgrace and punishment and therefore ought
    in my humble opinion instead of a whipping to have a statue
    erected to my memory



PREFACE TO POOR RICHARD 

COURTEOUS READER

This is the th Time I have entertaind thee with my annual
Productions I hope to thy Profit as well as mine For besides the
astronomical Calculations and other Things usually containd in
Almanacks which have their daily Use indeed while the Year continues
but then become of no Value I have constantly interspersd moral
Sentences prudent Maxims and wise Sayings many of them containing
much good Sense in very few Words and therefore apt to leave
strong and lasting Impressions on the Memory of young Persons
whereby they may receive Benefit as long as they live when both
Almanack and Almanackmaker have been long thrown by and forgotten If I
now and then insert a Joke or two that seem to have little in them my
Apology is that such may have their Use since perhaps for their Sake
light airy Minds peruse the rest and so are struck by somewhat of more
Weight and Moment The Verses on the Heads of the Months are also
generally designd to have the same Tendency I need not tell thee that
not many of them are of my own Making If thou hast any Judgment in
Poetry thou wilt easily discern the Workman from the Bungler I know as
well as thee that I am no Poet born and it is a Trade I never
learnt nor indeed could learn If I make Verses tis in Spightof
Nature and my Stars I write Why then should I give my Readers bad
Lines of my own when good Ones of other Peoples are so plenty Tis
methinks a poor Excuse for the bad Entertainment of Guests that the
Food we set before them tho coarse and ordinary is of ones own
Raising off ones own Plantation c when there is Plenty of what is
ten times better to be had in the MarketOn the contrary I assure

SIR

I have lately written two long Letters to you on the Subject of
Electricity one by the Governors Vessel the other per Mesnard On
some further Experiments since I have observd a Phenomenon or two that
I cannot at present account for on the Principle laid down in those
Letters and am therefore become a little diffident of my Hypothesis
and ashamd that I have expressd myself in so positive a manner In
going on with these Experiments how many pretty Systems do we build
which we soon find ourselves obligd to destroy If there is no other
Use discoverd of Electricity this however is something considerable
that it may help to make a vain man humble

I must now request that you would not Expose those Letters or if you
communicate them to any Friends you would at least conceal my Name I
have not Time to add but that I am Sir

PREFACE TO POOR RICHARD IMPROVED 

KIND READER

The favourable Reception my annual Labours have met with from the
Publick these  Years past has engaged me in Gratitude to endeavour
some Improvements of my Almanack And since my Friend Taylor is no
more whose Ephemerides so long and so agreeably servd and
entertaind these Provinces I have taken the Liberty to imitate his
wellknown Method and give two Pages for each Month which affords me
Room for several valuable Additions as will best appear on Inspection
and Comparison with former Almanacks Yet I have not so far followd his
Method as not to continue my own when I thought it preferable and thus
my Book is increasd to a Size beyond his and contains much more
Matter

      Hail Night serene thro Thee whereer we turn
    Our wondring Eyes Heavns Lamps profusely burn
    And Stars unnumberd all the Sky adorn
    But lowhats that I see appear
    It seems far off a pointed flame
    From Earthwards too the shining Meteor came
    How swift it climbs th etherial Space
    And now it traverses each Sphere
    And seems some knowing Mind familiar to the Place
    Dame hand my Glass the longest strait prepare
    Tis Hetis TAYLORS Soul that travels there
    O stay thou happy Spirit stay
    And lead me on thro all th unbeaten Wilds of Day
    Where Planets in pure Streams of Ether driven
    Swim thro the blue Expanse of Heavn
    There let me thy Companion stray
    From Orb to Orb and now behold
    Unnumberd Suns all Seas of molten Gold
    And trace each Comets wandring Way

Souse down into Prose again my Muse for Poetrys no more thy Element
than Air is that of the FlyingFish whose Flights like thine are
therefore always short and heavy



ADVICE TO A YOUNG TRADESMAN



TO MY FRIEND A B

As you have desired it of me I write the following hints which have
been of service to me and may if observed be so to you

Remember that time is money He that can earn ten shillings a day by
his labour and goes abroad or sits idle one half of that day though
he spends but sixpence during his diversion or idleness ought not to
reckon that the only expense he has really spent or rather thrown
away five shillings besides

Remember that credit is money If a man lets his money lie in my
hands after it is due he gives me the interest or so much as I can
make of it during that time This amounts to a considerable sum where a
man has good and large credit and makes good use of it

Remember that money is of the prolific generating nature Money can
beget money and its offspring can beget more and so on Five shillings
turned is six turned again it is seven and threepence and so on till
it becomes an hundred pounds The more there is of it the more it
produces every turning so that the profits rise quicker and quicker He
that kills a breeding sow destroys all her offspring to the thousandth
generation He that murders a crown destroys all that it might have
produced even scores of pounds

Remember that six pounds a year is but a groat a day For this little
sum which may be daily wasted either in time or expense unperceived a
man of credit may on his own security have the constant possession and
use of an hundred pounds So much in stock briskly turned by an
industrious man produces great advantage

Remember this saying The good paymaster is lord of another mans
purse He that is known to pay punctually and exactly to the time he
promises may at any time and on any occasion raise all the money his
friends can spare This is sometimes of great use After industry and
frugality nothing contributes more to the raising of a young man in the
world than punctuality and justice in all his dealings therefore never
keep borrowed money an hour beyond the time you promised lest a
disappointment shut up your friends purse for ever

The most trifling actions that affect a mans credit are to be regarded
The sound of your hammer at five in the morning or nine at night heard
by a creditor makes him easy six months longer but if he sees you at
a billiardtable or hears your voice at a tavern when you should be at
work he sends for his money the next day demands it before he can
receive it in a lump

It shows besides that you are mindful of what you owe it makes you
appear a careful as well as an honest man and that still increases your
credit

Beware of thinking all your own that you possess and of living
accordingly It is a mistake that many people who have credit fall into
To prevent this keep an exact account for some time both of your
expenses and your income If you take the pains at first to mention
particulars it will have this good effect you will discover how
wonderfully small trifling expenses mount up to large sums and will
discern what might have been and may for the future be saved without
occasioning any great inconvenience

In short the way to wealth if you desire it is as plain as the way to
market It depends chiefly on two words industry and frugality
that is waste neither time nor money but make the best use of
both Without industry and frugality nothing will do and with them
every thing He that gets all he can honestly and saves all he gets
necessary expenses excepted will certainly become rich if that
Being who governs the world to whom all should look for a blessing on
their honest endeavours doth not in his wise providence otherwise
determine

TO GEORGE WHITEFIELD

                                      Philadelphia July  

DEAR SIR

Since your being in England I have received two of your favours and a
box of books to be disposed of It gives me great pleasure to hear of
your welfare and that you purpose soon to return to America

We have no news here worth writing to you The affair of the building
remains in statu quo there having been no new application to the
Assembly about it or anything done in consequence of the former

I have received no money on your account from Mr Thanklin or from
Boston Mrs Read and your other friends here in general are well and
will rejoice to see you again

I am glad to hear that you have frequent opportunities of preaching
among the great If you can gain them to a good and exemplary life
wonderful changes will follow in the manners of the lower ranks for ad
exemplum regis etc On this principle Confucius the famous Eastern
reformer proceeded When he saw his country sunk in vice and
wickedness of all kinds triumphant he applied himself first to the
grandees and having by his doctrine won them to the cause of
virtue the commons followed in multitudes The mode has a wonderful
influence on mankind and there are numbers who perhaps fear less the
being in hell than out of the fashion Our most western reformations
began with the ignorant mob and when numbers of them were gained
interest and party views drew in the wise and great Where both methods
can be used reformations are likely to be more speedy O that some
method could be found to make them lasting He who discovers that will
in my opinion deserve more ten thousand times than the inventor of
the longitude

My wife and family join in the most cordial salutations to you and good
Mrs Whitefield

I am dear Sir your very affectionate friend and most obliged humble
Servant

PROPOSALS RELATING TO THE EDUCATION OF YOUTH IN PENSILVANIA

PHILADELPHIA PRINTED IN THE YEAR MDCCXLIX

   Advertisement to the Reader

   It has long been regretted as a Misfortune to the Youth of
   this Province that we have no ACADEMY in which they might
   receive the Accomplishments of a regular Education The
   following Paper of Hints towards forming a Plan for that
   Purpose is so far approvd by some publickspirited
   Gentlemen to whom it has been privately communicated that
   they have directed a Number of Copies to be made by the Press
   and properly distributed in order to obtain the Sentiments
   and Advice of Men of Learning Understanding and Experience
   in these Matters and have determined to use their Interest
   and best Endeavours to have the Scheme when compleated
   carried gradually into Execution in which they have Reason to
   believe they shall have the hearty Concurrence and Assistance
   of many who are Wellwishers to their Country Those who
   incline to favour the Design with their Advice either as to
   the Parts of Learning to be taught the Order of Study the
   Method of Teaching the conomy of the School or any other
   Matter of Importance to the Success of the Undertaking are
   desired to communicate their Sentiments as soon as may be by
   Letter directed to B FRANKLIN Printer in PHILADELPHIA


PROPOSALS

The good Education of Youth has been esteemed by wise Men in all Ages
as the surest Foundation of the Happiness both of private Families and
of Commonwealths Almost all Governments have therefore made it a
principal Object of their Attention to establish and endow with proper
Revenues such Seminaries of Learning as might supply the succeeding
Age with Men qualified to serve the Publick with Honour to themselves
and to their Country

Many of the first Settlers of these Provinces were Men who had received
a good Education in Europe and to their Wisdom and good Management we
owe much of our present Prosperity But their Hands were full and they
could not do all Things The present Race are not thought to be
generally of equal Ability For though the American Youth are allowd
not to want Capacity yet the best Capacities require Cultivation it
being truly with them as with the best Ground which unless well tilled
and sowed with profitable Seed produces only ranker Weeds

That we may obtain the Advantages arising from an Increase of Knowledge
and prevent as much as may be the mischievous Consequences that would
attend a general Ignorance among us the following Hints are offered
towards forming a Plan for the Education of the Youth of Pennsylvania
viz

It is proposd

That some Persons of Leisure and publick Spirit apply for a CHARTER by
which they may be incorporated with Power to erect an ACADEMY for the
Education of Youth to govern the same provide Masters make Rules
receive Donations purchase Lands etc and to add to their Number
from Time to Time such other Persons as they shall judge suitable

That the Members of the Corporation make it their Pleasure and in some
Degree their Business to visit the Academy often encourage and
countenance the Youth countenance and assist the Masters and by all
Means in their Power advance the Usefulness and Reputation of the
Design that they look on the Students as in some Sort their Children
treat them with Familiarity and Affection and when they have behavd
well and gone through their Studies and are to enter the World
zealously unite and make all the Interest that can be made to establish
them whether in Business Offices Marriages or any other Thing for
their Advantage preferably to all other Persons whatsoever even of
equal Merit

And if Men may and frequently do catch such a Taste for cultivating
Flowers for Planting Grafting Inoculating and the like as to
despise all other Amusements for their Sake why may not we expect they
should acquire a Relish for that more useful Culture of young Minds
Thompson says

      Tis Joy to see the human Blossoms blow
    When infant Reason grows apace and calls
    For the kind Hand of an assiduous Care
    Delightful Task to rear the tender Thought
    To teach the young Idea how to shoot
    To pour the fresh Instruction oer the Mind
    To breathe th enlivning Spirit and to fix
    The generous Purpose in the glowing Breast

That a House be provided for the ACADEMY if not in the Town not many
Miles from it the Situation high and dry and if it may be not far
from a River having a Garden Orchard Meadow and a Field or two

That the House be furnished with a Library if in the Country if in the
Town the Town Libraries may serve with Maps of all Countries Globes
some mathematical Instruments an Apparatus for Experiments in Natural
Philosophy and for Mechanics Prints of all Kinds Prospects
Buildings Machines c

That the Rector be a Man of good Understanding good Morals diligent
and patient learnd in the Languages and Sciences and a correct pure
Speaker and Writer of the English Tongue to have such Tutors under
him as shall be necessary

That the boarding Scholars diet together plainly temperately and
frugally

That to keep them in Health and to strengthen and render active their
Bodies they be frequently exercisd in Running Leaping Wrestling and
Swimming c

That they have peculiar Habits to distinguish them from other Youth if
the Academy be in or near the Town for this among other Reasons that
their Behaviour may be the better observed

As to their STUDIES it would be well if they could be taught every
Thing that is useful and every Thing that is ornamental But Art is
long and their Time is short It is therefore proposd that they learn
those Things that are likely to be most useful and most ornamental
Regard being had to the several Professions for which they are intended

All should be taught to write a fair Hand and swift as that is
useful to All And with it may be learnt something of Drawing by
Imitation of Prints and some of the first Principles of Perspective

Arithmetick Accounts and some of the first Principles of
Geometry and Astronomy

The English Language might be taught by Grammar in which some of our
best Writers as Tillotson Addison Pope Algernoon Sidney
Catos Letters c should be Classicks the Stiles principally to
be cultivated being the clear and the concise Reading should also
be taught and pronouncing properly distinctly emphatically not with
an even Tone which underdoes nor a theatrical which overdoes
Nature

To form their Stile they should be put on Writing Letters to each other
making Abstracts of what they read or writing the same Things in their
own Words telling or writing Stories lately read in their own
Expressions All to be revisd and corrected by the Tutor who should
give his Reasons and explain the Force and Import of Words c

To form their Pronunciation they may be put on making Declamations
repeating Speeches delivering Orations c The Tutor assisting at the
Rehearsals teaching advising correcting their Accent c

But if History be made a constant Part of their Reading such as the
Translations of the Greek and Roman Historians and the modern
Histories of ancient Greece and Rome c may not almost all Kinds
of useful Knowledge be that Way introducd to Advantage and with
Pleasure to the Student As

GEOGRAPHY by reading with Maps and being required to point out the
Places where the greatest Actions were done to give their old and new
Names with the Bounds Situation Extent of the Countries concernd
c

CHRONOLOGY by the Help of Helvicus or some other Writer of the Kind
who will enable them to tell when those Events happened what Princes
were Cotemporaries what States or famous Men flourishd about that
Time c The several principal Epochas to be first well fixd in their
Memories

ANTIENT CUSTOMS religious and civil being frequently mentioned in
History will give Occasion for explaining them in which the Prints of
Medals BassoRelievos and antient Monuments will greatly assist

MORALITY by descanting and making continual Observations on the Causes
of the Rise or Fall of any Mans Character Fortune Power c mentiond
in History the Advantages of Temperance Order Frugality Industry
Perseverance c c Indeed the general natural Tendency of Reading
good History must be to fix in the Minds of Youth deep Impressions of
the Beauty and Usefulness of Virtue of all Kinds Publick Spirit
Fortitude c

History will show the wonderful Effects of ORATORY in governing
turning and leading great Bodies of Mankind Armies Cities Nations
When the Minds of Youth are struck with Admiration at this then is the
Time to give them the Principles of that Art which they will study with
Taste and Application Then they may be made acquainted with the best
Models among the antients their Beauties being particularly pointed out
to them Modern Political Oratory being chiefly performed by the Pen and
Press its Advantages over the Antient in some Respects are to be shown
as that its Effects are more extensive more lasting c

History will also afford frequent Opportunities of showing the
Necessity of a Publick Religion from its Usefulness to the Publick
the Advantage of a Religious Character among private Persons the
Mischiefs of Superstition c and the Excellency of the CHRISTIAN
RELIGION above all others antient or modern

History will also give Occasion to expatiate on the Advantage of Civil
Orders and Constitutions how Men and their Properties are protected by
joining in Societies and establishing Government their Industry
encouraged and rewarded Arts invented and Life made more comfortable
The Advantages of Liberty Mischiefs of Licentiousness Benefits
arising from good Laws and a due Execution of Justice c Thus may the
first Principles of sound Politicks be fixd in the Minds of Youth

On Historical Occasions Questions of Right and Wrong Justice and
Injustice will naturally arise and may be put to Youth which they may
debate in Conversation and in Writing When they ardently desire
Victory for the Sake of the Praise attending it they will begin to
feel the Want and be sensible of the Use of Logic or the Art of
Reasoning to discover Truth and of Arguing to defend it and
convince Adversaries This would be the Time to acquaint them with the
Principles of that Art Grotius Puffendorff and some other Writers of
the same Kind may be used on these Occasions to decide their Disputes
Publick Disputes warm the Imagination whet the Industry and strengthen
the natural Abilities

When Youth are told that the Great Men whose Lives and Actions they
read in History spoke two of the best Languages that ever were the
most expressive copious beautiful and that the finest Writings the
most correct Compositions the most perfect Productions of human Wit and
Wisdom are in those Languages which have endured Ages and will endure
while there are Men that no Translation can do them Justice or give
the Pleasure found in Reading the Originals that those Languages
contain all Science that one of them is become almost universal being
the Language of Learned Men in all Countries that to understand them is
a distinguishing Ornament c they may be thereby made desirous of
learning those Languages and their Industry sharpend in the
Acquisition of them All intended for Divinity should be taught the
Latin and Greek for Physick the Latin Greek and French
for Law the Latin and French Merchants the French German
and Spanish And though all should not be compelld to learn Latin
Greek or the modern foreign Languages yet none that have an ardent
Desire to learn them should be refused their English Arithmetick and
other Studies absolutely necessary being at the same Time not neglected

If the new Universal History were also read it would give a
connected Idea of human Affairs so far as it goes which should be
followd by the best modern Histories particularly of our Mother
Country then of these Colonies which should be accompanied with
Observations on their Rise Encrease Use to Great Britain
Encouragements Discouragements etc the Means to make them flourish
secure their Liberties c

With the History of Men Times and Nations should be read at proper
Hours or Days some of the best Histories of Nature which would not
only be delightful to Youth and furnish them with Matter for their
Letters c as well as other History but afterwards of great Use to
them whether they are Merchants Handicrafts or Divines enabling the
first the better to understand many Commodities Drugs c the second
to improve his Trade or Handicraft by new Mixtures Materials c and
the last to adorn his Discourses by beautiful Comparisons and
strengthen them by new Proofs of Divine Providence The Conversation of
all will be improved by it as Occasions frequently occur of making
Natural Observations which are instructive agreeable and entertaining
in almost all Companies Natural History will also afford
Opportunities of introducing many Observations relating to the
Preservation of Health which may be afterwards of great Use
Arbuthnot on Air and Aliment Sanctorius on Perspiration Lemery
on Foods and some others may now be read and a very little
Explanation will make them sufficiently intelligible to Youth

While they are reading Natural History might not a little Gardening
Planting Grafting Inoculating etc be taught and practised
and now and then Excursions made to the neighbouring Plantations of the
best Farmers their Methods observd and reasond upon for the
Information of Youth The Improvement of Agriculture being useful to
all and Skill in it no Disparagement to any

The History of Commerce of the Invention of Arts Rise of
Manufactures Progress of Trade Change of its Seats with the Reasons
Causes c may also be made entertaining to Youth and will be useful
to all And this with the Accounts in other History of the prodigious
Force and Effect of Engines and Machines used in War will naturally
introduce a Desire to be instructed in Mechanicks and to be informd
of the Principles of that Art by which weak Men perform such Wonders
Labour is savd Manufactures expedited c This will be the Time to
show them Prints of antient and modern Machines to explain them to let
them be copied and to give Lectures in Mechanical Philosophy

With the whole should be constantly inculcated and cultivated that
Benignity of Mind which shows itself in searching for and seizing
every Opportunity to serve and to oblige and is the Foundation of
what is called GOOD BREEDING highly useful to the Possessor and most
agreeable to all

The Idea of what is true Merit should also be often presented to
Youth explaind and impressd on their Minds as consisting in an
Inclination joind with an Ability to serve Mankind ones Country
Friends and Family which Ability is with the Blessing of God to be
acquird or greatly encreasd by true Learning and should indeed be
the great Aim and End of all Learning



IDEA OF THE ENGLISH SCHOOL

Sketchd out for the Consideration of the Trustees of the Philadelphia
Academy 

It is expected that every Scholar to be admitted into this School be at
least able to pronounce and divide the Syllables in Reading and to
write a legible Hand None to be receivd that are under  Years of
Age


FIRST OR LOWEST CLASS

Let the first Class learn the English Grammar Rules and at the same
time let particular Care be taken to improve them in Orthography
Perhaps the latter is best done by Pairing the Scholars two of those
nearest equal in their Spelling to be put together let these strive for
Victory each propounding Ten Words every Day to the other to be spelt
He that spells truly most of the others Words is Victor for that Day
he that is Victor most Days in a Month to obtain a Prize a pretty neat
Book of some Kind useful in their future Studies This Method fixes the
Attention of Children extreamly to the Orthography of Words and makes
them good Spellers very early Tis a Shame for a Man to be so ignorant
of this little Art in his own Language as to be perpetually
confounding Words of like Sound and different Significations the
Consciousness of which Defect makes some Men otherwise of good
Learning and Understanding averse to Writing even a common Letter

Let the Pieces read by the Scholars in this Class be short such as
Croxalls Fables and little Stories In giving the Lesson let it
be read to them let the Meaning of the difficult Words in it be
explained to them and let them con it over by themselves before they
are called to read to the Master or Usher who is to take particular
Care that they do not read too fast and that they duly observe the
Stops and Pauses A Vocabulary of the most usual difficult Words might
be formed for their Use with Explanations and they might daily get a
few of those Words and Explanations by Heart which would a little
exercise their Memories or at least they might write a Number of them
in a small Book for the Purpose which would help to fix the Meaning of
those Words in their Minds and at the same Time furnish every one with
a little Dictionary for his future Use


THE SECOND CLASS

to be taught Reading with Attention and with proper Modulations of the
Voice according to the Sentiments and Subject

Some short Pieces not exceeding the Length of a Spectator to be
given this Class as Lessons and some of the easier Spectators would
be very suitable for the Purpose These Lessons might be given over
Night as Tasks the Scholars to study them against the Morning Let it
then be required of them to give an Account first of the Parts of
Speech and Construction of one or two Sentences this will oblige them
to recur frequently to their Grammar and fix its principal Rules in
their Memory Next of the Intention of the Writer or the Scope of
the Piece the Meaning of each Sentence and of every uncommon Word
This would early acquaint them with the Meaning and Force of Words and
give them that most necessary Habit of Reading with Attention

The Master then to read the Piece with the proper Modulations of Voice
due Emphasis and suitable Action where Action is required and put the
Youth on imitating his Manner

Where the Author has usd an Expression not the best let it be pointed
out and let his Beauties be particularly remarked to the Youth

Let the Lessons for Reading be varied that the Youth may be made
acquainted with good Stiles of all Kinds in Prose and Verse and the
proper Manner of reading each Kind Sometimes a welltold Story a Piece
of a Sermon a Generals Speech to his Soldiers a Speech in a Tragedy
some Part of a Comedy an Ode a Satyr a Letter Blank Verse
Hudibrastick Heroic etc But let such Lessons for Reading be chosen
as contain some useful Instruction whereby the Understandings or Morals
of the Youth may at the same Time be improvd

It is requird that they should first study and understand the Lessons
before they are put upon reading them properly to which End each Boy
should have an English Dictionary to help him over Difficulties When
our Boys read English to us we are apt to imagine they understand
what they read because we do and because tis their Mother Tongue
But they often read as Parrots speak knowing little or nothing of the
Meaning And it is impossible a Reader should give the due Modulation to
his Voice and pronounce properly unless his Understanding goes before
his Tongue and makes him Master of the Sentiment Accustoming Boys to
read aloud what they do not first understand is the Cause of those even
set Tones so common among Readers which when they have once got a Habit
of using they find so difficult to correct By which Means among Fifty
Readers we scarcely find a good One For want of good Reading Pieces
publishd with a View to influence the Minds of Men for their own or the
publick Benefit lose Half their Force Were there but one good Reader
in a Neighbourhood a publick Orator might be heard throughout a Nation
with the same Advantages and have the same Effect on his Audience as
if they stood within the Reach of his Voice


THE THIRD CLASS

to be taught Speaking properly and gracefully which is near of Kin to
good Reading and naturally follows it in the Studies of Youth Let the
Scholars of this Class begin with learning the Elements of Rhetoric from
some short System so as to be able to give an Account of the most usual
Tropes and Figures Let all their bad Habits of Speaking all Offences
against good Grammar all corrupt or foreign Accents and all improper
Phrases be pointed out to them Short Speeches from the Roman or
other History or from our Parliamentary Debates might be got by
heart and deliverd with the proper Action c Speeches and Scenes in
our best Tragedies and Comedies avoiding every Thing that could injure
the Morals of Youth might likewise be got by Rote and the Boys
exercisd in delivering or acting them great Care being taken to form
their Manner after the truest Models

For their farther Improvement and a little to vary their Studies let
them now begin to read History after having got by Heart a short
Table of the principal Epochas in Chronology They may begin with
Rollins Antient and Roman Histories and proceed at proper Hours as
they go thro the subsequent Classes with the best Histories of our own
Nation and Colonies Let Emulation be excited among the Boys by giving
Weekly little Prizes or other small Encouragements to those who are
able to give the best Account of what they have read as to Times
Places Names of Persons c This will make them read with Attention
and imprint the History well in their Memories In remarking on the
History the Master will have fine Opportunities of instilling
Instruction of various Kinds and improving the Morals as well as the
Understandings of Youth

The Natural and Mechanic History containd in the Spectacle de la
Nature might also be begun in this Class and continued thro the
subsequent Classes by other Books of the same Kind For next to the
Knowledge of Duty this Kind of Knowledge is certainly the most
useful as well as the most entertaining The Merchant may thereby be
enabled better to understand many Commodities in Trade the
Handicraftsman to improve his Business by new Instruments Mixtures and
Materials and frequently Hints are given of new Manufactures or new
Methods of improving Land that may be set on foot greatly to the
Advantage of a Country


THE FOURTH CLASS

to be taught Composition Writing ones own Language well is the next
necessary Accomplishment after good Speaking Tis the WritingMasters
Business to take Care that the Boys make fair Characters and place them
straight and even in the Lines But to form their Stile and even to
take Care that the Stops and Capitals are properly disposed is the Part
of the English Master The Boys should be put on Writing Letters to
each other on any common Occurrences and on various Subjects imaginary
Business c containing little Stories Accounts of their late
Reading what Parts of Authors please them and why Letters of
Congratulation of Compliment of Request of Thanks of Recommendation
of Admonition of Consolation of Expostulation Excuse c In these
they should be taught to express themselves clearly concisely and
naturally without affected Words or highflown Phrases All their
Letters to pass through the Masters Hand who is to point out the
Faults advise the Corrections and commend what he finds right Some of
the best Letters published in our own Language as Sir William
Temples those of Pope and his Friends and some others might be
set before the Youth as Models their Beauties pointed out and explained
by the Master the Letters themselves transcribd by the Scholar

Dr Johnsons Ethices Elementa or First Principles of Morality
may now be read by the Scholars and explaind by the Master to lay a
solid Foundation of Virtue and Piety in their Minds And as this Class
continues the Reading of History let them now at proper Hours receive
some farther Instruction in Chronology and in that Part of Geography
from the Mathematical Master which is necessary to understand the
Maps and Globes They should also be acquainted with the modern Names of
the Places they find mentiond in antient Writers The Exercises of good
Reading and proper Speaking still continued at suitable Times


FIFTH CLASS

To improve the Youth in Composition they may now besides continuing
to write Letters begin to write little Essays in Prose and sometimes
in Verse not to make them Poets but for this Reason that nothing
acquaints a Lad so speedily with Variety of Expression as the Necessity
of finding such Words and Phrases as will suit with the Measure Sound
and Rhime of Verse and at the same time well express the Sentiment
These Essays should all pass under the Masters Eye who will point out
their Faults and put the Writer on correcting them Where the Judgment
is not ripe enough for forming new Essays let the Sentiments of a
Spectator be given and requird to be cloathd in a Scholars own
Words or the Circumstances of some good Story the Scholar to find
Expression Let them be put sometimes on abridging a Paragraph of a
diffuse Author sometimes on dilating or amplifying what is wrote more
closely And now let Dr Johnsons Noetica or First Principles of
Human Knowledge containing a Logic or Art of Reasoning c be read by
the Youth and the Difficulties that may occur to them be explained by
the Master The Reading of History and the Exercises of good Reading
and just Speaking still continued


SIXTH CLASS

In this Class besides continuing the Studies of the preceding in
History Rhetoric Logic Moral and Natural Philosophy the best
English Authors may be read and explaind as Tillotson Milton
Locke Addison Pope Swift the higher Papers in the
Spectator and Guardian the best Translations of Homer Virgil
and Horace of Telemachus Travels of Cyrus c

Once a Year let there be publick Exercises in the Hall the Trustees and
Citizens present Then let fine gilt Books be given as Prizes to such
Boys as distinguish themselves and excel the others in any Branch of
Learning making three Degrees of Comparison giving the best Prize to
him that performs best a less valuable One to him that comes up next to
the best and another to the third Commendations Encouragement and
Advice to the rest keeping up their Hopes that by Industry they may
excel another Time The Names of those that obtain the Prizes to be
yearly printed in a List

The Hours of each Day are to be divided and disposd in such a Manner
as that some Classes may be with the WritingMaster improving their
Hands others with the Mathematical Master learning Arithmetick
Accompts Geography Use of the Globes Drawing Mechanicks c while
the rest are in the English School under the English Masters Care

Thus instructed Youth will come out of this School fitted for learning
any Business Calling or Profession except such wherein Languages are
required and tho unacquainted with any antient or foreign Tongue they
will be Masters of their own which is of more immediate and general
Use and withal will have attaind many other valuable Accomplishments
the Time usually spent in acquiring those Languages often without
Success being here employd in laying such a Foundation of Knowledge
and Ability as properly improvd may qualify them to pass thro and
execute the several Offices of civil Life with Advantage and Reputation
to themselves and Country

TO CADWALLADER COLDEN ESQ AT NEW YORK

Communicated to Mr Collinson

                                             Philadelphia 

SIR

I inclose you answers such as my present hurry of business will permit
me to make to the principal queries contained in yours of the th
instant and beg leave to refer you to the latter piece in the printed
collection of my papers for farther explanation of the difference
between what are called electrics per se and nonelectrics When
you have had time to read and consider these papers I will endeavour to
make any new experiments you shall propose that you think may afford
farther light or satisfaction to either of us and shall be much obliged
to you for such remarks objections c as may occur to you

I forget whether I wrote you that I have melted brass pins and steel
needles inverted the poles of the magnetic needle given a magnetism
and polarity to needles that had none and fired dry gunpowder by the
electric spark I have five bottles that contain  or  gallons each
two of which chargd are sufficient for those purposes but I can
charge and discharge them altogether There are no bounds but what
expence and labour give to the force man may raise and use in the
electrical way for bottle may be added to bottle in infinitum and
all united and discharged together as one the force and effect
proportioned to their number and size The greatest known effects of
common lightning may I think without much difficulty be exceeded in
this way which a few years since could not have been believed and even
now may seem to many a little extravagant to suppose So we are got
beyond the skill of Rabelaiss devils of two years old who he
humorously says had only learnt to thunder and lighten a little round
the head of a cabbage

                     I am with sincere respect
                             Your most obliged humble servant

EXPORTING OF FELONS TO THE COLONIES

From the Pennsylvania Gazette May  

TO THE PRINTERS OF THE GAZETTE

By a Passage in one of your late Papers I understand that the
Government at home will not suffer our mistaken Assemblies to make any
Law for preventing or discouraging the Importation of Convicts from
Great Britain for this kind Reason That such Laws are against the
Publick Utility as they tend to prevent the IMPROVEMENT and WELL
PEOPLING of the Colonies

Such a tender parental Concern in our Mother Country for the
Welfare of her Children calls aloud for the highest Returns of
Gratitude and Duty This every one must be sensible of But tis said
that in our present Circumstances it is absolutely impossible for us to
make such as are adequate to the Favour I own it but nevertheless
let us do our Endeavour Tis something to show a grateful Disposition

In some of the uninhabited Parts of these Provinces there are Numbers
of these venomous Reptiles we call RATTLESNAKES Felonsconvict from
the Beginning of the World These whenever we meet with them we put to
Death by Virtue of an old Law Thou shalt bruise his Head But as
this is a sanguinary Law and may seem too cruel and as however
mischievous those Creatures are with us they may possibly change their
Natures if they were to change the Climate I would humbly propose
that this general Sentence of Death be changed for Transportation

In the Spring of the Year when they first creep out of their Holes
they are feeble heavy slow and easily taken and if a small Bounty
were allowd per Head some Thousands might be collected annually and
transported to Britain There I would propose to have them carefully
distributed in St Jamess Park in the SpringGardens and other
Places of Pleasure about London in the Gardens of all the Nobility
and Gentry throughout the Nation but particularly in the Gardens of
the Prime Ministers the Lords of Trade and Members of Parliament
for to them we are most particularly obliged

There is no human Scheme so perfect but some Inconveniencies may be
objected to it Yet when the Conveniencies far exceed the Scheme is
judgd rational and fit to be executed Thus Inconveniencies have been
objected to that good and wise Act of Parliament by virtue of which
all the Newgates and Dungeons in Britain are emptied into the
Colonies It has been said that these Thieves and Villains introducd
among us spoil the Morals of Youth in the Neighbourhoods that entertain
them and perpetrate many horrid Crimes But let not private Interests
obstruct publick Utility Our Mother knows what is best for us What
is a little Housebreaking Shoplifting or Highway Robbing what
is a Son now and then corrupted and hangd a Daughter debauchd
and poxd a Wife stabbd a Husbands Throat cut or a Childs
Brains beat out with an Axe compard with this IMPROVEMENT and WELL
PEOPLING of the Colonies

Thus it may perhaps be objected to my Scheme that the RattleSnake is
a mischievous Creature and that his changing his Nature with the Clime
is a mere Supposition not yet confirmd by sufficient Facts What then
Is not Example more prevalent than Precept And may not the honest rough
British Gentry by a Familiarity with these Reptiles learn to creep
and to insinuate and to slaver and to wriggle into Place and
perhaps to poison such as stand in their Way Qualities of no small
Advantage to Courtiers In comparison of which IMPROVEMENT and PUBLICK
UTILITY what is a Child now and then killd by their venomous Bite
 or even a favourite Lap Dog

I would only add that this exporting of Felons to the Colonies may be
considerd as a Trade as well as in the Light of a Favour Now all
Commerce implies Returns Justice requires them There can be no Trade
without them And RattleSnakes seem the most suitable Returns for
the Human Serpents sent us by our Mother Country In this however
as in every other Branch of Trade she will have the Advantage of us
She will reap equal Benefits without equal Risque of the
Inconveniencies and Dangers For the RattleSnake gives Warning
before he attempts his Mischief which the Convict does not I am

                                                Yours c
                                                      AMERICANUS



OBSERVATIONS

CONCERNING THE INCREASE OF MANKIND PEOPLING OF COUNTRIES ETC

Written in Pensilvania 

 Tables of the Proportion of Marriages to Births of Deaths to Births
of Marriages to the Numbers of Inhabitants c formd on Observaions
sic made upon the Bills of Mortality Christnings c of populous
Cities will not suit Countries nor will Tables formd on Observations
made on fullsettled old Countries as Europe suit new Countries as
America

 For People increase in Proportion to the Number of Marriages and
that is greater in Proportion to the Ease and Convenience of supporting
a Family When families can be easily supported more Persons marry and
earlier in Life

 In Cities where all Trades Occupations and Offices are full many
delay marrying till they can see how to bear the Charges of a Family
which Charges are greater in Cities as Luxury is more common many live
single during Life and continue Servants to Families Journeymen to
Trades c hence Cities do not by natural Generation supply themselves
with Inhabitants the Deaths are more than the Births

 In Countries full settled the Case must be nearly the same all
Lands being occupied and improved to the Heighth those who cannot get
Land must Labour for others that have it when Labourers are plenty
their Wages will be low by low Wages a family is supported with
Difficulty this Difficulty deters many from Marriage who therefore
long continue Servants and single Only as the Cities take Supplies of
People from the Country and thereby make a little more Room in the
Country Marriage is a little more encouragd there and the Births
exceed the Deaths

 Europe is generally full settled with Husbandmen Manufacturers
c and therefore cannot now much increase in People America is
chiefly occupied by Indians who subsist mostly by Hunting But as the
Hunter of all Men requires the greatest Quantity of Land from whence
to draw his Subsistence the Husbandman subsisting on much less the
Gardner on still less and the Manufacturer requiring least of all the
Europeans found America as fully settled as it well could be by
Hunters yet these having large Tracks were easily prevaild on to
part with Portions of Territory to the new Comers who did not much
interfere with the Natives in Hunting and furnishd them with many
Things they wanted

 Land being thus plenty in America and so cheap as that a labouring
man that understands Husbandry can in a short Time save Money enough
to purchase a Piece of new Land sufficient for a Plantation whereon he
may subsist a Family such are not afraid to marry for if they even
look far enough forward to consider how their Children when grown up
are to be provided for they see that more Land is to be had at rates
equally easy all Circumstances considered

 Hence Marriages in America are more general and more generally
early than in Europe And if it is reckoned there that there is but
one Marriage per Annum among  persons perhaps we may here reckon
two and if in Europe they have but  Births to a Marriage many of
their Marriages being late we may here reckon  of which if one half
grow up and our Marriages are made reckoning one with another at 
Years of Age our People must at least be doubled every  Years

 But notwithstanding this Increase so vast is the Territory of North
America that it will require many Ages to settle it fully and till
it is fully settled Labour will never be cheap here where no Man
continues long a Labourer for others but gets a Plantation of his own
no Man continues long a Journeyman to a Trade but goes among those new
Settlers and sets up for himself c Hence Labour is no cheaper now in
Pennsylvania than it was  Years ago tho so many Thousand
labouring People have been imported

 The Danger therefore of these Colonies interfering with their Mother
Country in Trades that depend on Labour Manufactures c is too
remote to require the attention of Great Britain

 But in Proportion to the Increase of the Colonies a vast Demand is
growing for British Manufactures a glorious Market wholly in the Power
of Britain in which Foreigners cannot interfere which will increase
in a short Time even beyond her Power of supplying tho her whole Trade
should be to her Colonies Therefore Britain should not too much
restrain Manufactures in her Colonies A wise and good Mother will not
do it To distress is to weaken and weakening the Children weakens the
whole Family

 Besides if the Manufactures of Britain by reason of the
American Demands should rise too high in Price Foreigners who can
sell cheaper will drive her Merchants out of Foreign Markets Foreign
Manufactures will thereby be encouraged and increased and consequently
foreign Nations perhaps her Rivals in Power grow more populous and
more powerful while her own Colonies kept too low are unable to
assist her or add to her Strength

 Tis an illgrounded Opinion that by the Labour of slaves America
may possibly vie in Cheapness of Manufactures with Britain The Labour
of Slaves can never be so cheap here as the Labour of working Men is in
Britain Any one may compute it Interest of Money is in the Colonies
from  to  per Cent Slaves one with another cost  Sterling per
Head Reckon then the Interest of the first Purchase of a Slave the
Insurance or Risque on his Life his Cloathing and Diet Expences in his
Sickness and Loss of Time Loss by his Neglect of Business Neglect is
natural to the Man who is not to be benefited by his own Care or
Diligence Expence of a Driver to keep him at Work and his Pilfering
from Time to Time almost every Slave being by Nature a Thief and
compare the whole Amount with the Wages of a Manufacturer of Iron or
Wood in England you will see that Labour is much cheaper there than
it ever can be by Negroes here Why then will Americans purchase
Slaves Because Slaves may be kept as long as a Man pleases or has
Occasion for their Labour while hired Men are continually leaving their
masters often in the midst of his Business and setting up for
themselvesSec 

 As the Increase of People depends on the Encouragement of Marriages
the following Things must diminish a Nation viz  The being
conquered for the Conquerors will engross as many Offices and exact
as much Tribute or Profit on the Labour of the conquered as will
maintain them in their new Establishment and this diminishing the
Subsistence of the Natives discourages their Marriages and so
gradually diminishes them while the foreigners increase  Loss of
Territory Thus the Britons being driven into Wales and crowded
together in a barren Country insufficient to support such great Numbers
diminished till the People bore a Proportion to the Produce while the
Saxons increasd on their abandoned lands till the Island became full
of English And were the English now driven into Wales by some
foreign Nation there would in a few Years be no more Englishmen in
Britain than there are now people in Wales  Loss of Trade
Manufactures exported draw Subsistence from Foreign Countries for
Numbers who are thereby enabled to marry and raise Families If the
Nation be deprived of any Branch of Trade and no new Employment is
found for the People occupyd in that Branch it will also be soon
deprived of so many People  Loss of Food Suppose a Nation has a
Fishery which not only employs great Numbers but makes the Food and
Subsistence of the People cheaper If another Nation becomes Master of
the Seas and prevents the Fishery the People will diminish in
Proportion as the Loss of Employ and Dearness of Provision makes it
more difficult to subsist a Family  Bad Government and insecure
Property People not only leave such a Country and settling Abroad
incorporate with other Nations lose their native Language and become
Foreigners but the Industry of those that remain being discouragd
the Quantity of Subsistence in the Country is lessend and the Support
of a Family becomes more difficult So heavy Taxes tend to diminish a
People  The Introduction of Slaves The Negroes brought into the
English Sugar Islands have greatly diminishd the Whites there the
Poor are by this Means deprived of Employment while a few Families
acquire vast Estates which they spend on Foreign Luxuries and
educating their Children in the Habit of those Luxuries the same Income
is needed for the Support of one that might have maintaind  The
Whites who have Slaves not labouring are enfeebled and therefore not
so generally prolific the Slaves being workd too hard and ill fed
their Constitutions are broken and the Deaths among them are more than
the Births so that a continual Supply is needed from Africa The
Northern Colonies having few Slaves increase in Whites Slaves also
pejorate the Families that use them the white Children become
proud disgusted with Labour and being educated in Idleness are
rendered unfit to get a Living by Industry

 Hence the Prince that acquires new Territory if he finds it vacant
or removes the Natives to give his own People Room the Legislator that
makes effectual Laws for promoting of Trade increasing Employment
improving Land by more or better Tillage providing more Food by
Fisheries securing Property c and the Man that invents new Trades
Arts or Manufactures or new Improvements in Husbandry may be properly
called Fathers of their Nation as they are the Cause of the
Generation of Multitudes by the Encouragement they afford to Marriage

 As to Privileges granted to the married such as the Jus trium
Liberorum among the Romans they may hasten the filling of a Country
that has been thinned by War or Pestilence or that has otherwise vacant
Territory but cannot increase a People beyond the Means provided for
their Subsistence

 Foreign Luxuries and needless Manufactures imported and used in a
Nation do by the same Reasoning increase the People of the Nation
that furnishes them and diminish the People of the Nation that uses
them Laws therefore that prevent such Importations and on the
contrary promote the Exportation of Manufactures to be consumed in
Foreign Countries may be called with Respect to the People that make
them generative Laws as by increasing Subsistence they encourage
Marriage Such Laws likewise strengthen a Country doubly by increasing
its own People and diminishing its Neighbours

 Some European Nations prudently refuse to consume the Manufactures
of EastIndiaThey should likewise forbid them to their Colonies
for the Gain to the Merchant is not to be compard with the Loss by
this Means of People to the Nation

 Home Luxury in the Great increases the Nations Manufacturers
employd by it who are many and only tends to diminish the Families
that indulge in it who are few The greater the common fashionable
Expence of any Rank of People the more cautious they are of Marriage
Therefore Luxury should never be sufferd to become common

 The great Increase of Offspring in particular Families is not always
owing to greater Fecundity of Nature but sometimes to Examples of
Industry in the Heads and industrious Education by which the Children
are enabled to provide better for themselves and their marrying early
is encouraged from the Prospect of good Subsistence

 If there be a Sect therefore in our Nation that regard Frugality
and Industry as religious Duties and educate their Children therein
more than others commonly do such Sect must consequently increase more
by natural Generation than any other sect in Britain

 The Importation of Foreigners into a Country that has as many
Inhabitants as the present Employments and Provisions for Subsistence
will bear will be in the End no Increase of People unless the New
Comers have more Industry and Frugality than the Natives and then they
will provide more Subsistence and increase in the Country but they
will gradually eat the Natives out Nor is it necessary to bring in
Foreigners to fill up any occasional Vacancy in a Country for such
Vacancy if the Laws are good sec   will soon be filled by
natural Generation Who can now find the Vacancy made in Sweden
France or other Warlike Nations by the Plague of Heroism  years
ago in France by the Expulsion of the Protestants in England by
the Settlement of her Colonies or in Guinea by  Years Exportation
of Slaves that has blackend half America The thinness of
Inhabitants in Spain is owing to National Pride and Idleness and
other Causes rather than to the Expulsion of the Moors or to the
making of new Settlements

 There is in short no Bound to the prolific Nature of Plants or
Animals but what is made by their crowding and interfering with each
others means of Subsistence Was the Face of the Earth vacant of other
Plants it might be gradually sowed and overspread with one Kind only
as for Instance with Fennel and were it empty of other Inhabitants
it might in a few Ages be replenishd from one Nation only as for
Instance with Englishmen Thus there are supposd to be now upwards
of One Million English Souls in NorthAmerica tho tis thought
scarce  have been brought over Sea and yet perhaps there is not
one the fewer in Britain but rather many more on Account of the
Employment the Colonies afford to Manufacturers at Home This Million
doubling suppose but once in  Years will in another Century be
more than the People of England and the greatest Number of
Englishmen will be on this Side the Water What an Accession of Power
to the British Empire by Sea as well as Land What Increase of Trade
and Navigation What Numbers of Ships and Seamen We have been here but
little more than  years and yet the Force of our Privateers in the
late War united was greater both in Men and Guns than that of the
whole British Navy in Queen Elizabeths Time How important an
Affair then to Britain is the present Treaty for settling the Bounds
between her Colonies and the French and how careful should she be to
secure Room enough since on the Room depends so much the Increase of
her People

 In fine a Nation well regulated is like a Polypus take away a
Limb its Place is soon supplyd cut it in two and each deficient Part
shall speedily grow out of the Part remaining Thus if you have Room and
Subsistence enough as you may by dividing make ten Polypes out of one
you may of one make ten Nations equally populous and powerful or
rather increase a Nation ten fold in Numbers and Strength

And since Detachments of English from Britain sent to America
will have their Places at Home so soon supplyd and increase so largely
here why should the Palatine Boors be suffered to swarm into our
Settlements and by herding together establish their Language and
Manners to the Exclusion of ours Why should Pennsylvania founded by
the English become a Colony of Aliens who will shortly be so
numerous as to Germanize us instead of our Anglifying them and will
never adopt our Language or Customs any more than they can acquire our
Complexion

 Which leads me to add one Remark that the Number of purely white
People in the World is proportionably very small All Africa is black
or tawny Asia chiefly tawny America exclusive of the new Comers
wholly so And in Europe the Spaniards Italians French
Russians and Swedes are generally of what we call a swarthy
Complexion as are the Germans also the Saxons only excepted who
with the English make the principal Body of White People on the Face
of the Earth I could wish their Numbers were increased And while we
are as I may call it Scouring our Planet by clearing America of
Woods and so making this Side of our Globe reflect a brighter Light to
the Eyes of Inhabitants in Mars or Venus why should we in the
Sight of Superior Beings darken its People Why increase the Sons of
Africa by planting them in America where we have so fair an
Opportunity by excluding all Blacks and Tawneys of increasing the
lovely White and Red But perhaps I am partial to the Complexion of my
Country for such Kind of Partiality is natural to Mankind



TO PETER COLLINSON

Electrical Kite

                                    Philadelphia Oct  

SIR

As frequent mention is made in public papers from Europe of the
success of the Philadelphia experiment for drawing the electric fire
from clouds by means of pointed rods of iron erected on high buildings
c it may be agreeable to the curious to be informed that the same
experiment has succeeded in Philadelphia though made in a different
and more easy manner which is as follows

Make a small cross of two light strips of cedar the arms so long as to
reach to the four corners of a large thin silk handkerchief when
extended tie the corners of the handkerchief to the extremities of the
cross so you have the body of a kite which being properly accommodated
with a tail loop and string will rise in the air like those made of
paper but this being of silk is fitter to bear the wet and wind of a
thundergust without tearing To the top of the upright stick of the
cross is to be fixed a very sharppointed wire rising a foot or more
above the wood To the end of the twine next the hand is to be tied a
silk ribbon and where the silk and twine join a key may be fastened
This kite is to be raised when a thundergust appears to be coming on
and the person who holds the string must stand within a door or window
or under some cover so that the silk ribbon may not be wet and care
must be taken that the twine does not touch the frame of the door or
window As soon as any of the thunderclouds come over the kite the
pointed wire will draw the electric fire from them and the kite with
all the twine will be electrified and the loose filaments of the twine
will stand out every way and be attracted by an approaching finger And
when the rain has wet the kite and twine so that it can conduct the
electric fire freely you will find it stream out plentifully from the
key on the approach of your knuckle At this key the phial may be
charged and from electric fire thus obtained spirits may be kindled
and all the other electric experiments be performed which are usually
done by the help of a rubbed glass globe or tube and thereby the
sameness of the electric matter with that of lightning completely
demonstrated

   COURTEOUS READER

   This is the twentieth Time of my addressing thee in this
   Manner and I have reason to flatter myself my Labours have
   not been unacceptable to the Publick I am particularly
   pleasd to understand that my Predictions of the Weather
   give such general Satisfaction and indeed such Care is taken
   in the Calculations on which those Predictions are founded
   that I could almost venture to say theres not a single One
   of them promising Snow Rain Hail Heat Frost
   Fogs Wind or Thunder but what comes to pass
   punctually and precisely on the very Day in some Place or
   other on this little diminutive Globe of ours and when you
   consider the vast Distance of the Stars from whence we take
   our Aim you must allow it no small Degree of Exactness to hit
   any Part of it I say on this Globe for tho in other Matters
   I confine the Usefulness of my Ephemeris to the Northern
   Colonies yet in that important Matter of the Weather which
   is of such general Concern I would have it more extensively
   useful and therefore take in both Hemispheres and all
   Latitudes from Hudsons Bay to Cape Horn

   You will find this Almanack in my former Method only
   conformable to the NewStile established by the Act of
   Parliament which I gave you in my last at length the new Act
   since made for Amendment of that first Act not affecting us
   in the least being intended only to regulate some Corporation
   Matters in England before unprovided for I have only added
   a Column in the second Page of each Month containing the Days
   of the Old Stile opposite to their corresponding Days in the
   New which may in many Cases be of Use and so conclude
   believing you will excuse a short Preface when it is to make
   Room for something better

                            Thy Friend and Servant

    HYMN to the CREATOR from Psalm CIV

    Awake my Soul with Joy thy God adore
    Declare his Greatness celebrate his Powr
    Who cloathd with Honour and with Glory crownd
    Shines forth and cheers his Universe around
    Who with a radiant Veil of heavenly Light
    Himself conceals from all created Sight
    Who raisd the spacious Firmament on high
    And spread the azure Curtain of the Sky
    Whose awful Throne Heavns starry Arch sustains
    Whose Presence not Heavns vast Expanse restrains
    Whose Ways unsearchable no Eye can find
    The Clouds his Chariot and his Wings the Wind
    Whom Hosts of mighty Angels own their Lord
    And flaming Seraphim fulfil his Word
    Whose Powr of old the solid Earth did found
    Selfpoisd selfcenterd and with Strength girt round

    Or rush unbalancd thro the trackless Sky
    To reasning Man the sovreign Rule assignd
    His Delegate oer each inferior Kind
    Too soon to fall from that distinguishd Place
    His Honours staind with Guilt and foul Disgrace
      He saw the Pride of Earths aspiring Lord
    And in his Fury gave the dreadful Word
    Straight oer her peopled Plains his Floods were pourd
    And oer the Mountains the proud Billows roard
    Athwart the Face of Earth the Deluge sweeps
    And whelms the impious Nations in the Deeps
    Again God spakeand at his powrful Call
    The raging Floods asswage the Waters fall
    The Tempests hear his Voice and straight obey
    And at his Thunders Roar they haste away
    From off the lofty Mountains they subside
    And gently thro the winding Vallies glide
    Till in the spacious Caverns of the Deep
    They sink together and in Silence sleep
    There he hath stretchd abroad their liquid Plains
    And there Omnipotence their Rage restrains
    That Earth no more her Ruins may deplore
    And guilty Mortals dread their Wrath no more
      He bids the living Fountains burst the Ground
    And bounteous spread their Silver Streams around
    Down from the Hills they draw their shining Train
    Diffusing Health and Beauty oer the Plain
    There the fair Flocks allay the Summers Rage
    And panting Savages their Flame asswage
    On their sweet winding Banks th aerial Race
    In artless Numbers warble forth his Praise
    Or chant the harmless Raptures of their Loves
    And cheer the Plains and wake the vocal Groves
    Forth from his Treasures in the Skies he pours
    His precious Blessings in refreshing Showrs
    Each dying Plant with Joy new Life receives
    And thankful Nature smiles and Earth revives
    The fruitful Fields with Verdure he bespreads
    The Table of the Race that haunts the Meads
    And bids each Forest and each flowry Plain
    Send forth their native Physic for the Swain

    Thus doth the various Bounty of the Earth
    Support each Species crowding into Birth
    In purple Streams she bids her Vintage flow

    Which with new Life the feeble Limbs inspires

    Which wide extend their sacred Shades around
    There Lebanons proud Cedars nod their Heads
    There Bashans lofty Oaks extend their Shades
    The pointed Firs rise towring to the Clouds
    And Life and warbling Numbers fill the Woods
      Nor gentle Shades alone nor verdant Plains
    Nor fair enamelld Meads nor flowry Lawns

    Each Element with varied Being swells
    Race after Race arising view the Light
    Then silent pass away and sink in Night
    The Gift of Life thus boundlesly bestowd
    Proclaims th exhaustless Hand the Hand of God
      Nor less thy Glory in the etherial Spheres
    Nor less thy ruling Providence appears

    In solemn Silence sheds her Silver Light
    And thence the glorious Sun pours forth his Beams
    Thence copious spreads around his quickning Streams
    Each various Orb enjoys the golden Day

    Thus Light and Darkness their fixd Course maintain
    And still the kind Vicissitudes remain

    And wraps all Nature in her awful Shades

    Stretchd at their Ease the weary Labrers lie
    The restless Soul midst Lifes vain Tumults tost
    Forgets her Woes and evry Care is lost

    The Greatness of that Power which has been exerted in the
    Creation though every Object in Nature shews it will best
    appear by considering a little the GREAT Works properly so
    called of Nature the Sun and Planets and the fixed Stars
    The Sun and Moon the most conspicuous to us of all the
    celestial Bodies are the only ones mentioned in the sacred
    Text But the Invention of that noblest of Instruments the
    Telescope and the Sagacity of the Astronomers of later Ages
    whose Observations have improved and corrected those of the
    foregoing afford us a very different Idea of the Solar
    System from what the single Consideration of those two most
    conspicuous Bodies gives us As this may probably fall into
    the Hands of some who have not Leisure or Opportunities of
    reading Books of Astronomy the following brief View of our
    System and of the Immensity of the Creation according to
    the Theory of the Moderns may not be unacceptable

     It is proper in the first Place just to mention That the
    real Magnitudes Distances Orbits and other Affections of
    the Bodies of our System are determined by what Astronomers
    call their Parallaxes and by their Elongations from the Sun
    and their apparent Magnitudes and other analogical Methods
    which would take up by far too much Time to explain here by
    which it is possible to determine
                                                             their

    their Magnitudes and Distances when those Distances are
    not too great to yield a Parallax Astronomers for Example
    know certainly the Distance of the Moon from the Earth
    viz  thousand Miles because the Moon yields a very
    sensible Parallax and they know that the Suns Distance
    from the Earth is very probably at least ten thousand Times
    the Diameter or Thickness of the Earth which is about eight
    thousand Miles and brings the whole Distance to about eighty
    Millions of Miles It is I say hardly to be doubted that
    the Distance from the Sun to the Earth is at least eighty
    Millions of Miles but it is not certainly known whether it
    is not a great deal more In the Year  the Distance of
    all the Planets from the Sun will be determined to a great
    Degree of Exactness by Observations on a Transit of the
    Planet Venus over the Face of the Sun which is to happen
    the th of May OS in that Year But according to the
    present Theory the Sun to appear of the Magnitude he does
    to our Eyes at the Distance of eighty Millions of Miles must
    be a Body a great many hundred thousand Times larger than the
    Earth so that if his Centre were placed where that of the
    Earth is his outward Surface would extend one hundred and
    forty thousand Miles higher than the Orbit of the Moon his
    Diameter or Thickness being seven hundred and sixty thousand
    Miles whereas that of the Earth is but about eight thousand

    of Fire turns once round in about twentyfive Days This is
    known by a Number of dusky Spots which appear upon the Suns
    Face so as to be seen sometimes with the naked Eye when he
    shines through a thin Cloud or Mist but are always
    observable with the Help of a Telescope with a dark Glass
    for the Security of the Eye These Spots could not be visible
    at the Distance of the Sun if they were not as large as the
    whole Earth but such of them as appear of a considerable
    Breadth as they often do must be still vastly larger They
    never continue long to make the same Appearance but are
    always rising and vanishing again They are probably
    Exhalations floating in the Suns Atmosphere at some Distance
    from his Body or Masses of Cynder fallen from that
    Atmosphere upon his Surface

    Suns Light must be such as would be quite intolerable to
    Eyes like ours But it does not follow that Mercury is
    therefore uninhabitable since it can be no Difficulty for
    the Divine Power and Wisdom to accommodate the Inhabitants to
    the Place they are to inhabit as the Cold we see Frogs and
    Fishes bear very well would soon deprive any of our Species
    of Life To an Eye such as ours the Sun seen from this
    Planet would appear seven times as large as he does to us
    He is always so near the Sun that we have no Opportunity of
    discovering whether he turns round upon his own Axis or not
    and consequently cannot determine what Length the Days and
    Nights in Mercury are He is seen sometimes with Telescopes
    horned like the Moon and sometimes like a Half moon but
    never fully illuminated because that Side of the Planet on
    which the Sun shines is never turned full towards us except
    when he is so near the Sun as to be lost in the Brightness
    of his Beams His enlightned Side is always towards the Sun
    which shews that he only shines with the borrowed Light of
    the Sun That this Planet revolves round the Sun in an Orbit
    nearer to him than that of the Earth is plain because he
    is never seen opposite to the Sun but always in the West
    when he is seen at Sunsetting and in the East when he is
    seen at Sunrising and that never beyond the Distance of
    twentyeight degrees from the Sun a Degree is about

    twice the apparent Breadth of the Moon The same
    Considerations prove that the next Planet viz

     Venus revolves round the Sun in an Orbit including that
    of Mercury within it For she is always seen in the
    Neighbourhood of the Sun and never appears in the West when
    the Sun is in the East nor contrariwise nor ever removes
    above fortyeight Degrees from him When she is on one Side
    of her Orbit she it our Morning and on the other our
    Evening Star This Planet turns round upon its own Axis in
    twentythree Hours as the Earth does in twentyfour Venus
    performs her annual Revolution round the Sun in two hundred
    twentyfour Days at the Distance of about fiftynine
    Millions of Miles from the Sun She is nearly of the Size of
    the Earth She appears through a Telescope exactly as the
    Moon does to the naked Eye partly enlightened and partly
    dark and with the same Inequalities on her Face as on that
    of the Moon Some Astronomers fancy they have seen a
    Satellite or Moon near Venus like that belonging to the
    Earth But it is not yet certain whether they have deceived
    themselves or not

     The Earth which we inhabit possesses the next Place in
    the Solar System and at the Distance of about eighty
    Millions of Miles as above performs her yearly Revolution
    round the Sun in about three hundred sixtyfive Days and at
    the same time as a Bowl upon a

    Bowlinggreen not only proceeds forward but likewise turns
    round upon its own Axis so does the Earth turn once round
    upon its Axis as it goes along every twentyfour Hours It
    is astonishing and even frightful to think that this vast
    and cumbrous Globe of Earth and Sea which is almost
    twentyfive thousand Miles in Circumference has received
    such an Impulse from the Almighty Arm as has carried it
    constantly for above these five thousand Years that we know
    of round the Sun at the Rate of at least fifty thousand
    Miles every Hour which it must absolutely do to go round
    the Sun in a Year at the Distance of eighty Millions of Miles
    from him So that if an Angel were to come from some other
    World and to place himself near the Earths Way he would
    see it pass by him with a Swiftness to which that of a
    Cannon Ball is but as one to one hundred and would be left
    behind by it no less than the above Number of Miles in the
    Space of one Hour There is no more Reason to doubt that the
    Earth goes in this Manner round the Sun than there would be
    for a Passenger in a Ship on smooth Water who saw the
    Objects upon Land continually passing by to doubt whether
    the Vessel he was in or the Shore was in Motion We see the
    Sun continually changes his Place with respect to the fixed
    Stars and must own it to be highly improbable that this
    Change of Place is owing to any Change in the whole Heavens

    which considering the Distance of the starry Heavens would
    require a Motion infinitely more rapid than that above
    ascribed to the Earth As for the common Objection against
    the Earths Motion that we are not sensible of it and that
    a Stone thrown up from the Earth ought not to fall down upon
    the same Place again it is answered at once by the above
    Comparison of a Ship from which as has been often found by
    Experiment a Ball fired directly up in the Air does not
    fall behind the Ship let her Motion be ever so swift but
    partaking of the Ships Motion is carried forward in the
    Air and falls down again upon the Deck And as to the
    Objections taken from some Scripture Expressions which seem
    to contradict the Theory of the Earths Motion it is plain
    from innumerable Instances that Revelation was not given to
    Mankind to make them Philosophers or deep Reasoners but to
    improve them in Virtue and Piety and that it was therefore
    proper it should be expressed in a Manner accommodated to
    common Capacities and popular Opinions in all Points merely
    speculative and which were not to have any direct Influence
    upon the Hearts and Lives of Men The Truth of the Matter is
    that the Demonstrations given by the incomparable Sir Isaac
    Newton have established the Doctrine of the Motion of the
    Earth and other Planets and the Comets round the Sun and of
    the

    secondary Planets or Satellites round their Primaries in
    such a Manner as leaves no Room for any but such as do not
    understand them to hesitate about it The Suns apparent
    Rising and Setting is therefore owing to the Earths turning
    round upon its own Axis and his apparent Change of Place
    among the fixed Stars to our real Change of Situation round
    the Sun The different Seasons of the Year with all their
    delightful Varieties are owing to the most simple
    Contrivance that can be imagined viz The Inclination of
    the Earths Axis to the Plane of the Ecliptic Any Person who
    has not an Opportunity of seeing an Orrery may easily
    represent this by an Apple or any other round Body with a
    Wire thrust through the Middle of it and carried round a
    Table having a Candle placed on the Middle if the lower End
    of the Wire be made to touch the Table all the Way round and
    to lean a little the upper End still pointing towards the
    same Side of the Room by turning the Skewer round as it is
    carried along it will be easy to understand how the Earths
    Turning once round upon her own Axis makes a Day and a
    Night and by carrying the Apple round the Table it will be
    easy to shew how the Sun represented by the Candle must
    seem to change Place with regard to the fixed Stars and by
    observing how differently the Light of the Candle enlightens
    the different Parts of the Apple as the Wire points toward
                                                                it

    of the Length of the Days and Nights of the Suns shining
    more directly or more obliquely upon different Parts of the
    Earth and of the Heat of Summer and Cold of Winter may be
    made plain to any Capacity That the Earth is of a round or
    nearly round Figure is plain from the Shadow it casts upon
    the Face of the Moon in a partial Eclipse of the Moon which
    is always round and never of any other Figure It is also
    manifest from what it always observed at Sea viz That a
    Ship as it approaches first shews its Masts and Sails and
    by Degrees its lower Parts till it becomes all visible and
    as it goes off its Hulk is first lost and then its Sails

    Roundness of the Surface of the Ocean

    As the Earth is carried round the Sun once in a Year so is
    the Moon carried round the Earth once in about twentyseven
    Days accompanying her in her whole Revolution at the
    abovementioned Distance of two hundred and forty thousand
    Miles and keeping always the same Face towards the Earth
    That the Moon goes round the Earth as her Centre is evident
    to the Eye For when she is between the Sun and the Earth
    she is invisible to us her dark Side being turned toward us
    When she goes a little Way forward in her Revolution so as
    to come from between

    us and the Sun we see a small Part of her Body enlightned
    and so on still more and more till she comes to be in
    Opposition to the Sun and then we see all that Side of her
    which the Sun shines upon when we say she is full though
    the Sun does not in Reality enlighten any more of her Body
    at Full than at new Moon only her enlightened Side is turned
    towards us in the one Case and from us in the other This
    whole Matter may be made very plain to any Capacity in the
    same Manner as is above directed with regard to the Earths
    Revolution round the Sun by carrying a smaller Apple or Ball
    to represent the Moon round the first which represents the
    Earth and observing how the Light of the Candle shining upon
    the little Ball must appear to a Fly or other Insect placed
    upon the large one Whenever the Moon happens to come exactly
    between the Earth and the Sun she stops the Light of the
    Sun and then we say the Sun is eclipsed and according as
    the Moon happens to cover a Part or the Whole of the Suns
    Face we call the Eclipse partial or total Sometimes a total
    Eclipse of the Sun happens when the Moon is at her greatest
    Distance from the Earth for she does not go round the Earth
    in an exact Circle as neither do any of the rest of the
    primary or secondary Planets round their Centers and then
    as all Objects appear smaller according to their Distance
    she does not cover the whole Face of the Sun but a part

    of his Body is seen round the Moon like a shining Ring But
    if the Moon happens to come between the Earth and Sun when
    she is at her least Distance from the Earth she appears then
    so large as to cover the whole Face of the Sun and makes
    for some Minutes a Darkness equal to that of Twilight When
    the Earth comes exactly between the Sun and the Moon she
    darkens a Part of the Whole of the Moons Face and makes an
    Eclipse of the Moon The Earth being a Body about thirty or
    forty Times larger than the Moon casts a Shadow large enough
    to eclipse the Moon if her Diameter were three Times greater
    than it is whereas the Shadow of the Moon can never eclipse
    the whole Face of the Earth together If the Moon revolved
    round the Earth in the same Plane as the Earth goes round the
    Sun there would be constantly an Eclipse of the Sun every
    New and of the Moon every full Moon But to prevent this
    Inconvenience the Author of Nature has ordered Matters so
    that the Course of the Moon round the Earth is sometimes
    above and sometimes below that of the Earth round the Sun so
    that their Shadows generally miss one another These Motions
    are so exactly regulated that Astronomers can foretel
    Eclipses to Minutes at an hundred Years Distance than which
    there is not a more remarkable Instance either of human
    Sagacity or of the Truth of that Expression of
                                                         Scripture

    Scripture That the Works of God are all made in Number
    Weight and Measure It is certain by Observations made with
    good Telescopes that though the Face of the Moon is covered
    with innumerable Inequalities like the Mountains upon the
    Earth there is no great Collection of Waters upon it like
    our Oceans nor is there any Reason from her Appearance
    through those Instruments to suppose she has any such
    Appendage belonging to her as our Atmosphere of Air If the
    Moon is inhabited as she may for any Thing we know those
    who live on one Side or Hemisphere never can see our World
    and those who live on the other can never lose Sight of it
    except when the Earth comes between them and the Sun as she
    keeps always one Side turned towards us Those who live about
    the middle Parts of the Hemisphere that looks towards the
    Earth must see it always directly over their Heads with much
    the same Appearances as the Moon makes to us sometimes
    horned sometimes half and sometimes wholly illuminated but
    of a vastly greater Bulk than the Moon appears to us It
    seems highly probable that the Attraction of the Moon acting
    more strongly upon the Fluid than the solid Parts of our
    Terraqueous Globe is the Cause of our Tides as they answer
    so exactly to her Motions and Distances from us and other
    Circumstances To enter upon that Theory however would be
    beside my present Purpose

        How to secure Houses c from LIGHTNING

    It has pleased God in his Goodness to Mankind at length to
    discover to them the Means of securing their Habitations and
    other Buildings from Mischief by Thunder and Lightning The
    Method is this Provide a small Iron Rod it may be made of
    the Rodiron used by the Nailers but of such a Length that
    one End being three or four Feet in the moist Ground the
    other may be six or eight Feet above the highest Part of the
    Building To the upper End of the Rod fasten about a Foot of
    Brass Wire the Size of a common Knittingneedle sharpened
    to a fine Point the Rod may be secured to the House by a few
    small Staples If the House or Barn be long there may be a
    Rod and Point at each End and a middling Wire along the
    Ridge from one to the other A House thus furnished will not
    be damaged by Lightning it being attracted by the Points
    and passing thro the Metal into the Ground without hurting
    any Thing Vessels also having a sharp pointed Rod fixd on
    the Top of their Masts with a Wire from the Foot of the Rod
    reaching down round one of the Shrouds to the Water will
    not be hurt by Lightning

TO JOSEPH HUEY

                                      Philadelphia June  

SIR

I received your kind Letter of the d inst and am glad to hear that
you increase in Strength I hope you will continue mending till you
recover your former Health and firmness Let me know whether you still
use the Cold Bath and what Effect it has

As to the Kindness you mention I wish it could have been of more
Service to you But if it had the only Thanks I should desire is that
you would always be equally ready to serve any other Person that may
need your Assistance and so let good Offices go round for Mankind are
all of a Family

For my own Part when I am employed in serving others I do not look
upon myself as conferring Favours but as paying Debts In my Travels
and since my Settlement I have received much Kindness from Men to whom
I shall never have any Opportunity of making the least direct Return
And numberless Mercies from God who is infinitely above being benefited
by our Services Those Kindnesses from Men I can therefore only Return
on their Fellow Men and I can only shew my Gratitude for these mercies
from God by a readiness to help his other Children and my Brethren For
I do not think that Thanks and Compliments tho repeated weekly can
discharge our real Obligations to each other and much less those to our
Creator You will see in this my Notion of good Works that I am far
from expecting as you suppose that I shall ever to merit Heaven
by them By Heaven we understand a State of Happiness infinite in
Degree and eternal in Duration I can do nothing to deserve such
rewards He that for giving a Draught of Water to a thirsty Person
should expect to be paid with a good Plantation would be modest in his
Demands compard with those who think they deserve Heaven for the
little good they do on Earth Even the mixd imperfect Pleasures we
enjoy in this World are rather from Gods Goodness than our Merit how
much more such Happiness of Heaven For my own part I have not the
Vanity to think I deserve it the Folly to expect it nor the Ambition
to desire it but content myself in submitting to the Will and Disposal
of that God who made me who has hitherto preservd and blessd me and
in whose Fatherly Goodness I may well confide that he will never make
me miserable and that even the Afflictions I may at any time suffer
shall tend to my Benefit

The Faith you mention has doubtless its use in the World I do not
desire to see it diminished nor would I endeavour to lessen it in any
Man But I wish it were more productive of good Works than I have
generally seen it I mean real good Works Works of Kindness Charity
Mercy and Publick Spirit not Holidaykeeping SermonReading or
Hearing performing Church Ceremonies or making long Prayers filled
with Flatteries and Compliments despisd even by wise Men and much
less capable of pleasing the Deity The worship of God is a Duty the
hearing and reading of Sermons may be useful but if Men rest in
Hearing and Praying as too many do it is as if a Tree should Value
itself on being waterd and putting forth Leaves tho it never producd
any Fruit

Your great Master thot much less of these outward Appearances and
Professions than many of his modern Disciples He preferd the Doers
of the Word to the meer Hearers the Son that seemingly refusd to
obey his Father and yet performd his Commands to him that professd
his Readiness but neglected the Work the heretical but charitable
Samaritan to the uncharitable tho orthodox Priest and sanctified
Levite  those who gave Food to the hungry Drink to the Thirsty
Raiment to the Naked Entertainment to the Stranger and Relief to the
Sick tho they never heard of his Name he declares shall in the last
Day be accepted when those who cry Lord Lord who value themselves on
their Faith tho great enough to perform Miracles but have neglected
good Works shall be rejected He professd that he came not to call
the Righteous but Sinners to repentance which implyd his modest
Opinion that there were some in his Time so good that they need not
hear even him for Improvement but nowadays we have scarce a little
Parson that does not think it the Duty of every Man within his Reach to
sit under his petty Ministrations and that whoever omits them offends
God I wish to such more humility and to you health and happiness
being your friend and servant

                                                     B FRANKLIN



THREE LETTERS TO GOVERNOR SHIRLEY


LETTER I

Concerning the Voice of the People in Choosing the Rulers by Whom Taxes
are Imposed

                             Tuesday Morning December  

SIR

I return you the loose sheets of the plan with thanks to your
Excellency for communicating them

I apprehend that excluding the people of the colonies from all share
in the choice of the grand council will give extreme dissatisfaction as
well as the taxing them by act of Parliament where they have no
representative It is very possible that this general government might
be as well and faithfully administered without the people as with them
but where heavy burthens have been laid on them it has been found
useful to make it as much as possible their own act for they bear
better when they have or think they have some share in the direction
and when any public measures are generally grievous or even distasteful
to the people the wheels of government move more heavily


LETTER II

On the Imposition of Direct Taxes upon the Colonies without Their
Consent

                           Wednesday Morning December  

SIR

I mentioned it yesterday to your Excellency as my opinion that
excluding the people of the colonies from all share in the choice of
the grand council would probably give extreme dissatisfaction as well
as the taxing them by act of Parliament where they have no
representative In matters of general concern to the people and
especially where burthens are to be laid upon them it is of use to
consider as well what they will be apt to think and say as what they
ought to think I shall therefore as your Excellency requires it of me
briefly mention what of either kind occurs to me on this occasion

First they will say and perhaps with justice that the body of the
people in the colonies are as loyal and as firmly attached to the
present constitution and reigning family as any subjects in the kings
dominions

That there is no reason to doubt the readiness and willingness of the
representatives they may choose to grant from time to time such
supplies for the defence of the country as shall be judged necessary
so far as their abilities will allow

That the people in the colonies who are to feel the immediate mischiefs
of invasion and conquest by an enemy in the loss of their estates lives
and liberties are likely to be better judges of the quantity of forces
necessary to be raised and maintained forts to be built and supported
and of their own abilities to bear the expence than the parliament of
England at so great a distance

That governors often come to the colonies merely to make fortunes with
which they intend to return to Britain are not always men of the best
abilities or integrity have many of them no estates here nor any
natural connexions with us that should make them heartily concerned for
our welfare and might possibly be fond of raising and keeping up more
forces than necessary from the profits accruing to themselves and to
make provision for their friends and dependants

That the counsellors in most of the colonies being appointed by the
crown on the recommendation of governors are often of small estates
frequently dependant on the governors for offices and therefore too
much under influence

That there is therefore great reason to be jealous of a power in such
governors and councils to raise such sums as they shall judge
necessary by draft on the lords of the treasury to be afterwards laid
on the colonies by act of parliament and paid by the people here since
they might abuse it by projecting useless expeditions harassing the
people and taking them from their labour to execute such projects
merely to create offices and employments and gratify their dependants
and divide profits

That the parliament of England is at a great distance subject to be
misinformed and misled by such Governors and Councils whose united
interests might probably secure them against the effect of any complaint
from hence

That it is supposed an undoubted right of Englishmen not to be taxed
but by their own consent given through their representatives

That the colonies have no representatives in parliament

That to propose taxing them by parliament and refuse them the liberty
of choosing a representative council to meet in the colonies and
consider and judge of the necessity of any general tax and the quantum
shews suspicion of their loyalty to the crown or of their regard for
their country or of their common sense and understanding which they
have not deserved

That compelling the colonies to pay money without their consent would
be rather like raising contributions in an enemys country than taxing
of Englishmen for their own public benefit

That it would be treating them as a conquered people and not as true
British subjects

That a tax laid by the representatives of the colonies might easily be
lessened as the occasions should lessen but being once laid by
parliament under the influence of the representations made by Governors
would probably be kept up and continued for the benefit of Governors to
the grievous burthen and discouragement of the colonies and prevention
of their growth and increase

That a power in Governors to march the inhabitants from one end of the
British and French colonies to the other being a country of at least
 square miles without the approbation or the consent of their
representatives first obtained such expeditions might be grievous and
ruinous to the people and would put them on footing with the subjects
of France in Canada that now groan under such oppression from their
Governor who for two years past has harassed them with long and
destructive marches to Ohio

That if the colonies in a body may be well governed by governors and
councils appointed by the crown without representatives particular
colonies may as well or better be so governed a tax may be laid upon
them all by act of parliament for support of government and their
assemblies may be dismissed as an useless part of the constitution

That the powers proposed by the Albany Plan of Union to be vested in a
grand council representative of the people even with regard to military
matters are not so great as those the colonies of Rhode Island and
Connecticut are entrusted with by their charters and have never abused
for by this plan the presidentgeneral is appointed by the crown and
controls all by his negative but in those governments the people
choose the Governor and yet allow him no negative

That the British colonies bordering on the French are properly frontiers
of the British empire and the frontiers of an empire are properly
defended at the joint expence of the body of the people in such empire
It would now be thought hard by act of parliament to oblige the Cinque
Ports or seacoasts of Britain to maintain the whole navy because they
are more immediately defended by it not allowing them at the same time
a vote in choosing members of the parliament and if the frontiers in
America bear the expence of their own defence it seems hard to allow
them no share in voting the money judging of the necessity and sum or
advising the measures

That besides the taxes necessary for the defence of the frontiers the
colonies pay yearly great sums to the mothercountry unnoticed For
taxes paid in Britain by the landholder or artificer must enter into
and increase the price of the produce of land and of manufactures made
of it and great part of this is paid by consumers in the colonies who
thereby pay a considerable part of the British taxes

We are restrained in our trade with foreign nations and where we could
be supplied with any manufacture cheaper from them but must buy the
same dearer from Britain the difference of price is a clear tax to
Britain

We are obliged to carry a great part of our produce directly to Britain
and where the duties laid upon it lessen its price to the planter or it
sells for less than it would in foreign markets the difference is a tax
paid to Britain

Some manufactures we could make but are forbidden and must take them
of British merchants the whole price is a tax paid to Britain

By our greatly increasing the demand and consumption of British
manufactures their price is considerably raised of late years the
advantage is clear profit to Britain and enables its people better to
pay great taxes and much of it being paid by us is clear tax to
Britain

In short as we are not suffered to regulate our trade and restrain the
importation and consumption of British superfluities as Britain can the
consumption of foreign superfluities our whole wealth centers finally
amongst the merchants and inhabitants of Britain and if we make them
richer and enable them better to pay their taxes it is nearly the same
as being taxed ourselves and equally beneficial to the crown

These kind of secondary taxes however we do not complain of though we
have no share in the laying or disposing of them but to pay immediate
heavy taxes in the laying appropriation and disposition of which we
have no part and which perhaps we may know to be as unnecessary as
grievous must seem hard measure to Englishmen who cannot conceive
that by hazarding their lives and fortunes in subduing and settling new
countries extending the dominion and increasing the commerce of the
mother nation they have forfeited the native rights of Britons which
they think ought rather to be given to them as due to such merit if
they had been before in a state of slavery

These and such kind of things as these I apprehend will be thought
and said by the people if the proposed alteration of the Albany plan
should take place Then the administration of the board of governors and
councils so appointed not having any representative body of the people
to approve and unite in its measures and conciliate the minds of the
people to them will probably become suspected and odious dangerous
animosities and feuds will arise between the governors and governed and
every thing go into confusion

Perhaps I am too apprehensive in this matter but having freely given my
opinion and reasons your Excellency can judge better than I whether
there be any weight in them and the shortness of the time allowed me
will I hope in some degree excuse the imperfections of this scrawl

With the greatest respect and fidelity I have the honour to be

Your Excellencys most obedient and most humble servant

LETTER III

On the Subject of Uniting the Colonies More Intimately with Great
Britain by Allowing Them Representatives in Parliament

                                           Boston Dec  

SIR

Since the conversation your Excellency was pleased to honour me with on
the subject of uniting the colonies more intimately with Great
Britain by allowing them representatives in parliament I have
something further considered that matter and am of opinion that such a
union would be very acceptable to the colonies provided they had a
reasonable number of representatives allowed them and that all the old
acts of Parliament restraining the trade or cramping the manufactures of
the colonies be at the same time repealed and the British subjects on
this side the water put in those respects on the same footing with
those in Great Britain till the new Parliament representing the whole
shall think it for the interest of the whole to renact some or all of
them It is not that I imagine so many representatives will be allowed
the colonies as to have any great weight by their numbers but I think
there might be sufficient to occasion those laws to be better and more
impartially considered and perhaps to overcome the interest of a petty
corporation or of any particular set of artificers or traders in
England who heretofore seem in some instances to have been more
regarded than all the colonies or than was consistent with the general
interest or best national good I think too that the government of the
colonies by a parliament in which they are fairly represented would be
vastly more agreeable to the people than the method lately attempted to
be introduced by royal instructions as well as more agreeable to the
nature of an English constitution and to English liberty and that such
laws as now seem to bear hard on the colonies would when judged by
such a Parliament for the best interest of the whole be more cheerfully
submitted to and more easily executed

I should hope too that by such a union the people of Great Britain
and the people of the colonies would learn to consider themselves as
not belonging to a different community with different interests but to
one community with one interest which I imagine would contribute to
strengthen the whole and greatly lessen the danger of future
separations

It is I suppose agreed to be the general interest of any state that
its people be numerous and rich men enough to fight in its defence and
enough to pay sufficient taxes to defray the charge for these
circumstances tend to the security of the state and its protection from
foreign power But it seems not of so much importance whether the
fighting be done by John or Thomas or the tax paid by William or
Charles The iron manufacture employs and enriches British subjects but
is it of any importance to the state whether the manufacturers live at
Birmingham or Sheffield or both since they are still within its
bounds and their wealth and persons still at its command Could the
Goodwin Sands be laid dry by banks and land equal to a large country
thereby gained to England and presently filled with English
inhabitants would it be right to deprive such inhabitants of the common
privileges enjoyed by other Englishmen the right of vending their
produce in the same ports or of making their own shoes because a
merchant or a shoemaker living on the old land might fancy it more for
his advantage to trade or make shoes for them Would this be right even
if the land were gained at the expence of the state And would it not
seem less right if the charge and labour of gaining the additional
territory to Britain had been borne by the settlers themselves And
would not the hardship appear yet greater if the people of the new
country should be allowed no representatives in the parliament enacting
such impositions

Now I look on the colonies as so many counties gained to Great Britain
and more advantageous to it than if they had been gained out of the seas
around its coasts and joined to its land For being in different
climates they afford greater variety of produce and being separated by
the ocean they increase much more its shipping and seamen and since
they are all included in the British empire which has only extended
itself by their means and the strength and wealth of the parts are the
strength and wealth of the whole what imports it to the general state
whether a merchant a smith or a hatter grow rich in Old or New
England And if through increase of people two smiths are wanted for
one employed before why may not the new smith be allowed to live and
thrive in the new country as well as the old one in the old In
fine why should the countenance of a state be partially afforded to
its people unless it be most in favour of those who have most merit
And if there be any difference those who have most contributed to
enlarge Britains empire and commerce increase her strength her
wealth and the numbers of her people at the risk of their own lives
and private fortunes in new and strange countries methinks ought rather
to expect some preference With the greatest respect and esteem I have
the honour to be

Your Excellencys most obedient and most humble servant

                                                     B FRANKLIN

DEAR KATY

Your kind letter of January th is but just come to hand and I take
this first opportunity of acknowledging the favour It gives me great
pleasure to hear that you got home safe and well that day I thought
too much was hazarded when I saw you put off to sea in that very little
skiff tossed by every wave But the call was strong and just a sick
parent I stood on the shore and looked after you till I could no
longer distinguish you even with my glass then returned to your
sisters praying for your safe passage Towards evening all agreed that
you must certainly be arrived before that time the weather having been
so favourable which made me more easy and cheerful for I had been
truly concerned for you

I left New England slowly and with great reluctance Short days
journeys and loitering visits on the road for three or four weeks
manifested my unwillingness to quit a country in which I drew my first
breath spent my earliest and most pleasant days and had now received
so many fresh marks of the peoples goodness and benevolence in the
kind and affectionate treatment I had everywhere met with I almost
forgot I had a home till I was more than halfway towards it till I
had one by one parted with all my New England friends and was got
into the western borders of Connecticut among mere strangers Then
like an old man who having buried all he loved in this world begins
to think of heaven I began to think of and wish for home and as I
drew nearer I found the attraction stronger and stronger My diligence
and speed increased with my impatience I drove on violently and made
such long stretches that a very few days brought me to my own house
and to the arms of my good old wife and children where I remain thanks
to God at present well and happy

Persons subject to the hyp complain of the northeast wind as
increasing their malady But since you promised to send me kisses in
that wind and I find you as good as your word it is to me the gayest
wind that blows and gives me the best spirits I write this during a
northeast storm of snow the greatest we have had this winter Your
favours come mixed with the snowy fleeces which are pure as your virgin
innocence white as your lovely bosom andas cold But let it warm
towards some worthy young man and may Heaven bless you both with every
kind of happiness

I desired Miss Anna Ward to send you over a little book I left with
her for your amusement in that lonely island My respects to your good
father and mother and sister Let me often hear of your welfare since
it is not likely I shall ever again have the pleasure of seeing you
Accept mine and my wifes sincere thanks for the many civilities I
receive from you and your relations and do me the justice to believe
me dear girl your affectionate faithful friend and humble servant

                                                     B FRANKLIN

PS My respectful compliments to your good brother Ward and sister
and to the agreeable family of the Wards at Newport when you see them
Adieu



TO PETER COLLINSON

                                     Philadelphia Aug  

DEAR SIR

As you have my former papers on Whirlwinds c I now send you an
account of one which I had lately an opportunity of seeing and examining
myself

Being in Maryland riding with Colonel Tasker and some other
gentlemen to his countryseat where I and my son were entertained by
that amiable and worthy man with great hospitality and kindness we saw
in the vale below us a small whirlwind beginning in the road and
shewing itself by the dust it raised and contained It appeared in the
form of a sugarloaf spinning on its point moving up the hill towards
us and enlarging as it came forward When it passed by us its smaller
part near the ground appeared no bigger than a common barrel but
widening upwards it seemed at  or  feet high to be  or  feet
in diameter The rest of the company stood looking after it but my
curiosity being stronger I followed it riding close by its side and
observed its licking up in its progress all the dust that was under
its smaller part As it is a common opinion that a shot fired through a
waterspout will break it I tried to break this little whirlwind by
striking my whip frequently through it but without any effect Soon
after it quitted the road and took into the woods growing every
moment larger and stronger raising instead of dust the old dry leaves
with which the ground was thick covered and making a great noise with
them and the branches of the trees bending some tall trees round in a
circle swiftly and very surprizingly though the progressive motion of
the whirl was not so swift but that a man on foot might have kept pace
with it but the circular motion was amazingly rapid By the leaves it
was now filled with I could plainly perceive that the current of air
they were driven by moved upwards in a spiral line and when I saw the
trunks and bodies of large trees invelopd in the passing whirl which
continued intire after it had left them I no longer wondered that my
whip had no effect on it in its smaller state I accompanied it about
three quarters of a mile till some limbs of dead trees broken off by
the whirl flying about and falling near me made me more apprehensive
of danger and then I stopped looking at the top of it as it went on
which was visible by means of the leaves contained in it for a very
great height above the trees Many of the leaves as they got loose from
the upper and widest part were scattered in the wind but so great was
their height in the air that they appeared no bigger than flies My
son who was by this time come up with me followed the whirlwind till
it left the woods and crossed an old tobaccofield where finding
neither dust nor leaves to take up it gradually became invisible below
as it went away over that field The course of the general wind then
blowing was along with us as we travelled and the progressive motion of
the whirlwind was in a direction nearly opposite though it did not keep
a strait line nor was its progressive motion uniform it making little
sallies on either hand as it went proceeding sometimes faster and
sometimes slower and seeming sometimes for a few seconds almost
stationary then starting forward pretty fast again When we rejoined
the company they were admiring the vast height of the leaves now
brought by the common wind over our heads These leaves accompanied us
as we travelled some falling now and then round about us and some not
reaching the ground till we had gone near three miles from the place
where we first saw the whirlwind begin Upon my asking Colonel Tasker
if such whirlwinds were common in Maryland he answered pleasantly
No not at all common but we got this on purpose to treat Mr
Franklin And a very high treat it was to

                                                     Dear Sir
          Your affectionate friend and humble servant
                                                   B FRANKLIN



TO MISS CATHERINE RAY

                                    Philadelphia Sept  

Begone business for an hour at least and let me chat a little with
my Katy

I have now before me my dear girl three of your favours viz of March
the d March the th and May the st The first I received just
before I set out on a long journey and the others while I was on that
journey which held me near six weeks Since my return I have been in
such a perpetual hurry of public affairs of various kinds as renders it
impracticable for me to keep up my private correspondences even those
that afforded me the greatest pleasure

You ask in your last how I do and what I am doing and whether
everybody loves me yet and why I make them do so

In regard to the first I can say thanks to God that I do not remember
I was ever better I still relish all the pleasures of life that a
temperate man can in reason desire and through favour I have them all
in my power This happy situation shall continue as long as God pleases
who knows what is best for his creatures and I hope will enable me to
bear with patience and dutiful submission any change he may think fit to
make that is less agreeable As to the second question I must confess
but dont you be jealous that many more people love me now than ever
did before for since I saw you I have been enabled to do some general
services to the country and to the army for which both have thanked
and praised me and say they love me They say so as you used to do
and if I were to ask any favours of them they would perhaps as
readily refuse me so that I find little real advantage in being
beloved but it pleases my humour

Now it is near four months since I have been favoured with a single line
from you but I will not be angry with you because it is my fault I
ran in debt to you three or four letters and as I did not pay you
would not trust me any more and you had some reason But believe me I
am honest and tho I should never make equal returns you shall see I
will keep fair accounts Equal returns I can never make tho I should
write to you by every post for the pleasure I receive from one of yours
is more than you can have from two of mine The small news the domestic
occurrences among our friends the natural pictures you draw of persons
the sensible observations and reflections you make and the easy chatty
manner in which you express every thing all contribute to heighten the
pleasure and the more as they remind me of those hours and miles that
we talked away so agreeably even in a winter journey a wrong road and
a soaking shower

I long to hear whether you have continued ever since in that monastery
Block Island or have broke into the world again doing pretty
mischief how the lady Wards do and how many of them are married or
about it what is become of Mr B and Mr L and what the state of
your heart is at this instant But that perhaps I ought not to know
and therefore I will not conjure as you sometimes say I do If I
could conjure it should be to know what was that oddest question about
me that ever was thought of which you tell me a lady had just sent to
ask you

I commend your prudent resolutions in the article of granting favours
to lovers But if I were courting you I could not hardly approve such
conduct I should even be malicious enough to say you were too
knowing and tell you the old story of the Girl and the Miller I
enclose you the songs you write for and with them your Spanish letter
with a translation I honour that honest Spaniard for loving you It
showed the goodness of his taste and judgement But you must forget him
and bless some worthy young Englishman

You have spun a long thread five thousand and twentytwo yards It
will reach almost from Rhode Island hither I wish I had hold of one end
of it to pull you to me But you would break it rather than come The
cords of love and friendship are longer and stronger and in times past
have drawn me farther even back from England to Philadelphia I guess
that some of the same kind will one day draw you out of that Island

I was extremely pleased with the turf you sent me The Irish people who
have seen it say it is the right sort but I cannot learn that we have
any thing like it here The cheeses particularly one of them were
excellent All our friends have tasted it and all agree that it exceeds
any English cheese they ever tasted Mrs Franklin was very proud that
a young lady should have so much regard for her old husband as to send
him such a present We talk of you every time it comes to table She is
sure you are a sensible girl and a notable housewife and talks of
bequeathing me to you as a legacy but I ought to wish you a better and
hope she will live these hundred years for we are grown old together
and if she has any faults I am so used to em that I dont perceive
em as the song says

    Some faults we have all and so has my Joan
       But then theyre exceedingly small
     And now I am used they are like my own
       I scarcely can see em at all
                     My dear friends
       I scarcely can see em at all

Indeed I begin to think she has none as I think of you And since she
is willing I should love you as much as you are willing to be loved by
me let us join in wishing the old lady a long life and a happy

With her respectful compliments to you to your good mother and sisters
present mine though unknown and believe me to be dear girl your
affectionate friend and humble servant

                                                     B FRANKLIN

PS Sally says Papa my love to Miss KatyIf it was not quite
unreasonable I should desire you to write to me every post whether you
hear from me or not As to your spelling dont let those laughing
girls put you out of conceit with it It is the best in the world for
every letter of it stands for something

I am just returned from my military expedition and now my time is taken

TO MISS E HUBBARD

                                 Philadelphia February  

I condole with you We have lost a most dear and valuable relation
But it is the will of God and nature that these mortal bodies be laid
aside when the soul is to enter into real life This is rather an
embryo state a preparation for living A man is not completely born
until he be dead Why then should we grieve that a new child is born
among the immortals a new member added to their happy society

We are spirits That bodies should be lent us while they can afford us
pleasure assist us in acquiring knowledge or in doing good to our
fellow creatures is a kind and benevolent act of God When they become
unfit for these purposes and afford us pain instead of pleasure
instead of an aid become an incumbrance and answer none of the
intentions for which they were given it is equally kind and benevolent
that a way is provided by which we may get rid of them Death is that
way We ourselves in some cases prudently choose a partial death A
mangled painful limb which cannot be restored we willingly cut off
He who plucks out a tooth parts with it freely since the pain goes
with it and he who quits the whole body parts at once with all pains
and possibilities of pains and diseases which it was liable to or
capable of making him suffer

Our friend and we were invited abroad on a party of pleasure which is
to last for ever His chair was ready first and he is gone before us
We could not all conveniently start together and why should you and I
be grieved at this since we are soon to follow and know where to find
him

DEAR SIR

I received your Favour of the th of February with great Pleasure as
it informd me of your Welfare and expressd your continud Regard for
me I thank you for the Pamphlet you enclosd to me As we had just
observd a Provincial Fast on the same Occasion I thought it very
seasonable to be publishd in Pennsylvania and accordingly reprinted it
immediately

You mention your frequent wish that you were a Chaplain to an American
Army I sometimes wish that you and I were jointly employd by the
Crown to settle a Colony on the Ohio I imagine we could do it
effectually and without putting the Nation to much expence But I fear
we shall never be called upon for such a Service What a glorious Thing
it would be to settle in that fine Country a large strong Body of
Religious and Industrious People What a Security to the other Colonies
and Advantage to Britain by Increasing her People Territory Strength
and Commerce Might it not greatly facilitate the Introduction of pure
Religion among the Heathen if we could by such a Colony show them a
better Sample of Christians than they commonly see in our Indian
Traders the most vicious and abandoned Wretches of our Nation Life
like a dramatic Piece should not only be conducted with Regularity but
methinks it should finish handsomely Being now in the last Act I
begin to cast about for something fit to end with Or if mine be more
properly compard to an Epigram as some of its few Lines are but barely
tolerable I am very desirous of concluding with a bright Point In such
an Enterprise I could spend the Remainder of Life with Pleasure and I
firmly believe God would bless us with Success if we undertook it with
a sincere Regard to his Honour the Service of our gracious King and
which is the same thing the Publick Good

I thank you cordially for your generous Benefaction to the German
School They go on pretty well and will do better when Mr Smith
who has at present the principal Care of them shall learn to mind
Partywriting and Party Politicks less and his proper Business more
which I hope time will bring about

I thank you for your good Wishes and Prayers and am with the greatest
Esteem and Affection Dear Sir

                                Your most obedient humble Servant

Preface to Poor Richard Improved 

COURTEOUS READER

I have heard that nothing gives an Author so great Pleasure as to find
his Works respectfully quoted by other learned Authors This Pleasure I
have seldom enjoyed for tho I have been if I may say it without
Vanity an eminent Author of Almanacks annually now a full Quarter of
a Century my Brother Authors in the same Way for what Reason I know
not have ever been very sparing in their Applauses and no other Author
has taken the least Notice of me so that did not my Writings produce me
some solid Pudding the great Deficiency of Praise would have quite
discouraged me

I concluded at length that the People were the best Judges of my Merit
for they buy my Works and besides in my Rambles where I am not
personally known I have frequently heard one or other of my Adages
repeated with as Poor Richard says at the End ont this gave me
some Satisfaction as it showed not only that my Instructions were
regarded but discovered likewise some Respect for my Authority and I
own that to encourage the Practice of remembering and repeating those
wise Sentences I have sometimes quoted myself with great Gravity

Judge then how much I must have been gratified by an Incident I am going
to relate to you I stopt my Horse lately where a great Number of People
were collected at a Vendue of Merchant Goods The Hour of Sale not being
come they were conversing on the Badness of the Times and one of the
Company calld to a plain clean old Man with white Locks Pray
Father Abraham what think you of the Times Wont these heavy Taxes
quite ruin the Country How shall we ever be able to pay them What
would you advise us toFather Abraham stood up and replyd If
youd have my Advice Ill give it you in short for a Word to the Wise
is enough and many Words wont fill a Bushel as Poor Richard
says They joind in desiring him to speak his Mind and gathering
round him he proceeded as follows

    Friends says he and Neighbours the Taxes are indeed very
    heavy and if those laid on by the Government were the only
    Ones we had to pay we might more easily discharge them but
    we have many others and much more grievous to some of us We
    are taxed twice as much by our Idleness three times as
    much by our Pride and four times as much by our Folly
    and from these Taxes the Commissioners cannot ease or deliver
    us by allowing an Abatement However let us hearken to good
    Advice and something may be done for us God helps them
    that help themselves as Poor Richard says in his
    Almanack of 

    It would be thought a hard Government that should tax its
    People one tenth Part of their Time to be employed in its
    Service But Idleness taxes many of us much more if we
    reckon all that is spent in absolute Sloth or doing of
    nothing with that which is spent in idle Employments or
    Amusements that amount to nothing Sloth by bringing on
    Diseases absolutely shortens Life Sloth like Rust
    consumes faster than Labour wears while the used Key is
    always bright as Poor Richard says But dost thou love
    Life then do not squander Time for thats the Stuff Life is
    made of as Poor Richard saysHow much more than is
    necessary do we spend in Sleep forgetting that The sleeping
    Fox catches no Poultry and that there will be sleeping
    enough in the Grave as Poor Richard says If Time be of
    all Things the most precious wasting Time must be as
    Poor Richard says the greatest Prodigality since as he
    elsewhere tells us Lost Time is never found again and
    what we call Timeenough always proves little enough Let
    us then up and be doing and doing to the Purpose so by
    Diligence shall we do more with less Perplexity Sloth makes
    all Things difficult but Industry all easy as Poor
    Richard says and He that riseth late must trot all Day
    and shall scarce overtake his Business at Night While
    Laziness travels so slowly that Poverty soon overtakes
    him as we read in Poor Richard who adds Drive thy
    Business let not that drive thee and Early to Bed and
    early to rise makes a Man healthy wealthy and wise

    So what signifies wishing and hoping for better Times We
    may make these Times better if we bestir ourselves Industry
    need not wish as Poor Richard says and He that lives
    upon Hope will die fasting There are no Gains without
    Pains then Help Hands for I have no Lands or if I have
    they are smartly taxed And as Poor Richard likewise
    observes He that hath a Trade hath an Estate and He that
    hath a Calling hath an Office of Profit and Honour but
    then the Trade must be worked at and the Calling well
    followed or neither the Estate nor the Office will
    enable us to pay our TaxesIf we are industrious we shall
    never starve for as Poor Richard says At the working
    Mans House Hunger looks in but dares not enter Nor will
    the Bailiff or the Constable enter for Industry pays Debts
    while Despair encreaseth them says Poor RichardWhat
    though you have found no Treasure nor has any rich Relation
    left you a Legacy Diligence is the Mother of Good luck as
    Poor Richard says and God gives all Things to Industry
    Then plough deep while Sluggards sleep and you shall have
    Corn to sell and to keep says Poor Dick Work while it is
    called Today for you know not how much you may be hindered
    Tomorrow which makes Poor Richard say One Today is
    worth two Tomorrows and farther Have you somewhat to do
    Tomorrow do it Today If you were a Servant would you
    not be ashamed that a good Master should catch you idle Are
    you then your own Master be ashamed to catch yourself
    idle as Poor Dick says When there is so much to be done
    for yourself your Family your Country and your gracious
    King be up by Peep of Day Let not the Sun look down and
    say Inglorious here he lies Handle your Tools without
    Mittens remember that the Cat in Gloves catches no Mice
    as Poor Richard says Tis true there is much to be done
    and perhaps you are weak handed but stick to it steadily
    and you will see great Effects for constant Dropping wears
    away Stones and by Diligence and Patience the Mouse ate in
    two the Cable and little Strokes fell great Oaks as
    Poor Richard says in his Almanack the Year I cannot just
    now remember

    Methinks I hear some of you say Must a Man afford himself
    no LeisureI will tell thee my Friend what Poor
    Richard says Employ thy Time well if thou meanest to gain
    Leisure and since thou art not sure of a Minute throw not
    away an Hour Leisure is Time for doing something useful
    this Leisure the diligent Man will obtain but the lazy Man
    never so that as Poor Richard says a Life of Leisure
    and a Life of Laziness are two Things Do you imagine that
    Sloth will afford you more Comfort than Labour No for as
    Poor Richard says Trouble springs from Idleness and
    grievous Toil from needless Ease Many without Labour would
    live by their WITS only but they break for want of Stock
    Whereas Industry gives Comfort and Plenty and Respect Fly
    Pleasures and theyll follow you The diligent Spinner has
    a large Shift and now I have a Sheep and a Cow every Body
    bids me Good morrow all which is well said by Poor
    Richard

    But with our Industry we must likewise be steady
    settled and careful and oversee our own Affairs with
    our own Eyes and not trust too much to others for as
    Poor Richard says

        I never saw an oft removed Tree
        Nor yet an oft removed Family
        That throve so well as those that settled be

    And again Three Removes is as bad as a Fire and again
    Keep thy Shop and thy Shop will keep thee and again If
    you would have your Business done go If not send And
    again

        He that by the Plough would thrive
        Himself must either hold or drive

    And again The Eye of a Master will do more Work than both
    his Hands and again Want of Care does us more Damage than
    Want of Knowledge and again Not to oversee Workmen is to
    leave them your Purse open Trusting too much to others Care
    is the Ruin of many for as the Almanack says In the
    Affairs of this World Men are saved not by Faith but by
    the Want of it but a Mans own Care is profitable for
    saith Poor Dick Learning is to the Studious and Riches
    to the Careful as well as Power to the Bold and Heaven
    to the Virtuous And farther If you would have a faithful
    Servant and one that you like serve yourself And again
    he adviseth to Circumspection and Care even in the smallest
    Matters because sometimes a little Neglect may breed great
    Mischief adding For want of a Nail the Shoe was lost for
    want of a Shoe the Horse was lost and for want of a Horse
    the Rider was lost being overtaken and slain by the Enemy
    all for want of Care about a Horse shoe Nail

    So much for Industry my Friends and Attention to ones own
    Business but to these we must add Frugality if we would
    make our Industry more certainly successful A Man may if
    he knows not how to save as he gets keep his Nose all his
    Life to the Grindstone and die not worth a Groat at last
    A fat Kitchen makes a lean Will as Poor Richard says
    and

        Many Estates are spent in the Getting
        Since Women for Tea forsook Spinning and Knitting
        And Men for Punch forsook Hewing and Splitting

    If you would be wealthy says he in another Almanack
    think of Saving as well as of Getting The Indies have
    not made pain rich because her Outgoes are greater than
    her Incomes Away then with your expensive Follies and you
    will not have so much Cause to complain of hard Times heavy
    Taxes and chargeable Families for as Poor Dick says

        Women and Wine Game and Deceit
        Make the Wealth small and the Wants great

    And farther What maintains one Vice would bring up two
    Children You may think perhaps That a little Tea or a
    little Punch now and then Diet a little more costly
    Clothes a little finer and a little Entertainment now
    and then can be no great Matter but remember what Poor
    Richard says Many a Little makes a Mickle and farther
    Beware of little Expences a small Leak will sink a great
    Ship and again Who Dainties love shall Beggars prove
    and moreover Fools make Feasts and wise Men eat them

    Here you are all got together at this Vendue of Fineries
    and Knicknacks You call them Goods but if you do not
    take Care they will prove Evils to some of you You expect
    they will be sold cheap and perhaps they may for less than
    they cost but if you have no Occasion for them they must be
    dear to you Remember what Poor Richard says Buy what
    thou hast no Need of and ere long thou shalt sell thy
    Necessaries And again At a great Pennyworth pause a
    while He means that perhaps the Cheapness is apparent
    only and not real or the Bargain by straitning thee in
    thy Business may do thee more Harm than Good For in another
    Place he says Many have been ruined by buying good
    Pennyworths Again Poor Richard says Tis foolish to
    lay out Money in a Purchase of Repentance and yet this
    Folly is practised every Day at Vendues for want of minding
    the Almanack Wise Men as Poor Dick says learn by
    others Harms Fools scarcely by their own but Felix quem
    faciunt aliena Pericula cautum Many a one for the Sake of
    Finery on the Back have gone with a hungry Belly and half
    starved their Families Silks and Sattins Scarlet and
    Velvets as Poor Richard says put out the Kitchen Fire
    These are not the Necessaries of Life they can scarcely be
    called the Conveniencies and yet only because they look
    pretty how many want to have them The artificial
    Wants of Mankind thus become more numerous than the
    natural and as Poor Dick says For one poor Person
    there are an hundred indigent By these and other
    Extravagancies the Genteel are reduced to Poverty and
    forced to borrow of those whom they formerly despised but
    who through Industry and Frugality have maintained their
    Standing in which Case it appears plainly that a Ploughman
    on his Legs is higher than a Gentleman on his Knees as
    Poor Richard says Perhaps they have had a small Estate
    left them which they knew not the Getting of they think
    tis Day and will never be Night that a little to be
    spent out of so much is not worth minding a Child and a
    Fool as Poor Richard says imagine Twenty Shillings and
    Twenty Years can never be spent but always taking out of
    the Mealtub and never putting in soon comes to the
    Bottom then as Poor Dick says When the Wells dry
    they know the Worth of Water But this they might have known
    before if they had taken his Advice If you would know the
    Value of Money go and try to borrow some for he that
    goes a borrowing goes a sorrowing and indeed so does he
    that lends to such People when he goes to get it in
    againPoor Dick farther advises and says

        Fond Pride of Dress is sure a very Curse
        Eer Fancy you consult consult your Purse

    And again Pride is as loud a Beggar as Want and a great
    deal more saucy When you have bought one fine Thing you
    must buy ten more that your Appearance may be all of a
    Piece but Poor Dick says Tis easier to suppress the
    first Desire than to satisfy all that follow it And tis
    as truly Folly for the Poor to ape the Rich as for the Frog
    to swell in order to equal the Ox

        Great Estates may venture more
        But little Boats should keep near Shore

    Tis however a Folly soon punished for Pride that dines on
    Vanity sups on Contempt as Poor Richard says And in
    another Place Pride breakfasted with Plenty dined with
    Poverty and supped with Infamy And after all of what Use
    is this Pride of Appearance for which so much is risked
    so much is suffered It cannot promote Health or ease Pain
    it makes no Increase of Merit in the Person it creates Envy
    it hastens Misfortune

        What is a Butterfly At best
        Hes but a Caterpillar drest
        The gaudy Fops his Picture just

    as Poor Richard says

    But what Madness must it be to run in Debt for these
    Superfluities We are offered by the Terms of this Vendue
    Six Months Credit and that perhaps has induced some of us
    to attend it because we cannot spare the ready Money and
    hope now to be fine without it But ah think what you do
    when you run in Debt You give to another Power over your
    Liberty If you cannot pay at the Time you will be ashamed
    to see your Creditor you will be in Fear when you speak to
    him you will make poor pitiful sneaking Excuses and by
    Degrees come to lose your Veracity and sink into base
    downright lying for as Poor Richard says The second
    Vice is Lying the first is running in Debt And again to
    the same Purpose Lying rides upon Debts Back Whereas a
    freeborn Englishman ought not to be ashamed or afraid to
    see or speak to any Man living But Poverty often deprives a
    Man of all Spirit and Virtue Tis hard for an empty Bag to
    stand upright as Poor Richard truly says What would you
    think of that Prince or that Government who should issue an
    Edict forbidding you to dress like a Gentleman or a
    Gentlewoman on Pain of Imprisonment or Servitude Would you
    not say that you are free have a Right to dress as you
    please and that such an Edict would be a Breach of your
    Privileges and such a Government tyrannical And yet you are
    about to put yourself under that Tyranny when you run in Debt
    for such Dress Your Creditor has Authority at his Pleasure
    to deprive you of your Liberty by confining you in Goal
    sic for Life or to sell you for a Servant if you should
    not be able to pay him When you have got your Bargain you
    may perhaps think little of Payment but Creditors Poor
    Richard tells us have better Memories than Debtors and
    in another Place says Creditors are a superstitious Sect
    great Observers of set Days and Times The Day comes round
    before you are aware and the Demand is made before you are
    prepared to satisfy it Or if you bear your Debt in Mind the
    Term which at first seemed so long will as it lessens
    appear extreamly short Time will seem to have added Wings
    to his Heels as well as Shoulders Those have a short Lent
    saith Poor Richard who owe Money to be paid at Easter
    Then since as he says The Borrower is a Slave to the
    Lender and the Debtor to the Creditor disdain the Chain
    preserve your Freedom and maintain your Independency Be
    industrious and free be frugal and free At present
    perhaps you may think yourself in thriving Circumstances
    and that you can bear a little Extravangance sic without
    Injury but

        For Age and Want save while you may
        No Morning Sun lasts a whole Day

    as Poor Richard saysGain may be temporary and uncertain
    but ever while you live Expence is constant and certain and
    tis easier to build two Chimnies than to keep one in Fuel
    as Poor Richard says So rather go to Bed supperless than
    rise in Debt

        Get what you can and what you get hold
        Tis the Stone that will turn all your Lead into Gold

    as Poor Richard says And when you have got the
    Philosophers Stone sure you will no longer complain of bad
    Times or the Difficulty of paying Taxes

    This Doctrine my Friends is Reason and Wisdom but
    after all do not depend too much upon your own Industry
    and Frugality and Prudence though excellent Things for
    they may all be blasted without the Blessing of Heaven and
    therefore ask that Blessing humbly and be not uncharitable
    to those that at present seem to want it but comfort and
    help them Remember Job suffered and was afterwards
    prosperous

    And now to conclude Experience keeps a dear School but
    Fools will learn in no other and scarce in that for it is
    true we may give Advice but we cannot give Conduct as
    Poor Richard says However remember this They that wont
    be counselled cant be helped as Poor Richard says And
    farther That if you will not hear Reason shell surely rap
    your Knuckles

Thus the old Gentleman ended his Harangue The People heard it and
approved the Doctrine and immediately practised the contrary just as if
it had been a common Sermon for the Vendue opened and they began to
buy extravagantly notwithstanding all his Cautions and their own Fear
of TaxesI found the good Man had thoroughly studied my Almanacks
and digested all I had dropt on those Topicks during the Course of
Fiveandtwenty Years The frequent Mention he made of me must have
tired any one else but my Vanity was wonderfully delighted with it
though I was conscious that not a tenth Part of the Wisdom was my own
which he ascribed to me but rather the Gleanings I had made of the
Sense of all Ages and Nations However I resolved to be the better for
the Echo of it and though I had at first determined to buy Stuff for a
new Coat I went away resolved to wear my old One a little longer
Reader if thou wilt do the same thy Profit will be as great as mine

                     I am as ever
                           Thine to serve thee

TO HUGH ROBERTS

                                      London September  

DEAR FRIEND

Your kind letter of June st gave me great pleasure I thank you for the
concern you express about my health which at present seems tolerably
confirmed by my late journey into different parts of the kingdom that
have been highly entertaining as well as useful to me Your visits to my
little family in my absence are very obliging and I hope you will be so
good as to continue them Your remark on the thistle and the Scotch
motto made us very merry as well as your string of puns You will allow
me to claim a little merit or demerit in the last as having had some
hand in making you a punster but the wit of the first is keen and all
your own

Two of the former members of the Junto you tell me are departed this
life Potts and Parsons Odd characters both of them Parsons a wise
man that often acted foolishly Potts a wit that seldom acted wisely
If enough were the means to make a man happy one had always the
means of happiness without ever enjoying the thing the other had
always the thing without ever possessing the means Parsons even
in his prosperity always fretting Potts in the midst of his poverty
ever laughing It seems then that happiness in this life rather
depends on internals than externals and that besides the natural
effects of wisdom and virtue vice and folly there is such a thing as a
happy or an unhappy constitution They were both our friends and loved
us So peace to their shades They had their virtues as well as their
foibles they were both honest men and that alone as the world goes
is one of the greatest of characters They were old acquaintances in
whose company I formerly enjoyed a great deal of pleasure and I cannot
think of losing them without concern and regret

I shall as you suppose look on every opportunity you give me of doing
you service as a favour because it will afford me pleasure I know how
to make you ample returns for such favours by giving you the pleasure
of building me a house You may do it without losing any of your own
time it will only take some part of that you now spend in other folks
business It is only jumping out of their waters into mine

I am grieved for our friend Syngs loss You and I who esteem him and
have valuable sons ourselves can sympathize with him sincerely I hope
yours is perfectly recovered for your sake as well as for his own I
wish he may be in every respect as good and as useful as his father I
need not wish him more and can only add that I am with great esteem
dear friend yours affectionately

                                                     B FRANKLIN

PS I rejoice to hear of the prosperity of the Hospital and send the
wafers I do not quite like your absenting yourself from that good old
club the Junto Your more frequent presence might be a means of keeping
them from being all engaged in measures not the best for public welfare
I exhort you therefore to return to your duty and as the Indians
say to confirm my words I send you a Birmingham tile I thought the
neatness of the figures would please you



TO MRS JANE MECOM

                                      London September  

DEAR SISTER

I received your favour of June  I wonder you have had no letter from
me since my being in England I have wrote you at least two and I think
a third before this and what was next to waiting on you in person sent
you my picture In June last I sent Benny a trunk of books and wrote to
him I hope they are come to hand and that he meets with encouragement
in his business I congratulate you on the conquest of Cape Breton and
hope as your people took it by praying the first time you will now
pray that it may never be given up again which you then forgot Billy
is well but in the country I left him at Tunbridge Wells where we
spent a fortnight and he is now gone with some company to see
Portsmouth We have been together over a great part of England this
summer and among other places visited the town our father was born in
and found some relations in that part of the country still living

Our cousin Jane Franklin daughter of our uncle John died about a year
ago We saw her husband Robert Page who gave us some old letters to
his wife from uncle Benjamin In one of them dated Boston July 
 he writes that your uncle Josiah has a daughter Jane about twelve
years old a goodhumoured child So keep up to your character and
dont be angry when you have no letters In a little book he sent her
called None but Christ he wrote an acrostick on her name which for
namesakes sake as well as the good advice it contains I transcribe
and send you viz

    Illuminated from on high
     And shining brightly in your sphere
     Neer faint but keep a steady eye
     Expecting endless pleasures there

    Flee vice as youd a serpent flee
     Raise faith and hope three stories higher
     And let Christs endless love to thee
     Neer cease to make thy love aspire
     Kindness of heart by words express
     Let your obedience be sincere
     In prayer and praise your God address
     Nor cease till he can cease to hear

After professing truly that I had a great esteem and veneration for the
pious author permit me a little to play the commentator and critic on
these lines The meaning of three stories higher seems somewhat
obscure You are to understand then that faith hope and
charity have been called the three steps of Jacobs ladder reaching
from earth to heaven our author calls them stories likening religion
to a building and these are the three stories of the Christian edifice
Thus improvement in religion is called building up and edification
Faith is then the ground floor hope is up one pair of stairs My
dear beloved Jenny dont delight so much to dwell in those lower rooms
but get as fast as you can into the garret for in truth the best room
in the house is charity For my part I wish the house was turned
upside down tis so difficult when one is fat to go up stairs and
not only so but I imagine hope and faith may be more firmly built
upon charity than charity upon faith and hope However that may
be I think it the better reading to say

    Raise faith and hope one story higher

Correct it boldly and Ill support the alteration for when you are up
two stories already if you raise your building three stories higher you
will make five in all which is two more than there should be you
expose your upper rooms more to the winds and storms and besides I am
afraid the foundation will hardly bear them unless indeed you build
with such light stuff as straw and stubble and that you know wont
stand fire Again where the author says

    Kindness of heart by words express

strike out words and put in deeds The world is too full of
compliments already They are the rank growth of every soil and choak
the good plants of benevolence and beneficence nor do I pretend to be
the first in this comparison of words and actions to plants you may
remember an ancient poet whose works we have all studied and copied at
school long ago

    A man of words and not of deeds
     Is like a garden full of weeds

Tis a pity that good works among some sorts of people are so little
valued and good words admired in their stead I mean seemingly pious
discourses instead of humane benevolent actions Those they almost put
out of countenance by calling morality rotten morality righteousness
ragged righteousness and even filthy ragsand when you mention
virtue pucker up their noses as if they smelt a stink at the same time
that they eagerly snuff up an empty canting harangue as if it was a
posey of the choicest flowers So they have inverted the good old verse
and say now

    A man of deeds and not of words
     Is like a garden full of 

I have forgot the rhyme but remember tis something the very reverse of
perfume So much by way of commentary

My wife will let you see my letter containing an account of our
travels which I would have you read to sister Dowse and give my love
to her I have no thoughts of returning till next year and then may
possibly have the pleasure of seeing you and yours taking Boston in my
way home My love to brother and all your children concludes at this
time from dear Jenny your affectionate brother

                                                     B FRANKLIN



TO LORD KAMES

                                             London May  

MY DEAR LORD

I have endeavoured to comply with your request in writing something on
the present situation of our affairs in America in order to give more
correct notions of the British interest with regard to the colonies
than those I found many sensible men possessed of Inclosed you have
the production such as it is I wish it may in any degree be of service
to the public I shall at least hope this from it for my own part that
you will consider it as a letter from me to you and take its length as
some excuse for being so long acoming

I am now reading with great pleasure and improvement your excellent
work The Principles of Equity It will be of the greatest advantage
to the Judges in our colonies not only in those which have Courts of
Chancery but also in those which having no such courts are obliged to
mix equity with the common law It will be of more service to the colony
Judges as few of them have been bred to the law I have sent a book to
a particular friend one of the Judges of the Supreme Court in
Pennsylvania

I will shortly send you a copy of the Chapter you are pleased to mention
in so obliging a manner and shall be extremely obliged in receiving a
copy of the collection of Maxims for the Conduct of Life which you
are preparing for the use of your children I purpose likewise a little
work for the benefit of youth to be called The Art of Virtue
From the title I think you will hardly conjecture what the nature of
such a book may be I must therefore explain it a little Many people
lead bad lives that would gladly lead good ones but know not how to
make the change They have frequently resolved and endeavoured it
but in vain because their endeavours have not been properly conducted
To expect people to be good to be just to be temperate c without
shewing them how they should become so seems like the ineffectual
charity mentioned by the Apostle which consisted in saying to the
hungry the cold and the naked Be ye fed be ye warmed be ye
clothed without shewing them how they should get food fire or
clothing

Most people have naturally some virtues but none have naturally all
the virtues To acquire those that are wanting and secure what we
acquire as well as those we have naturally is the subject of an art
It is as properly an art as painting navigation or architecture If a
man would become a painter navigator or architect it is not enough
that he is advised to be one that he is convinced by the arguments
of his adviser that it would be for his advantage to be one and that
he resolves to be one but he must also be taught the principles of the
art be shewn all the methods of working and how to acquire the habits
of using properly all the instruments and thus regularly and gradually
he arrives by practice at some perfection in the art If he does not
proceed thus he is apt to meet with difficulties that discourage him
and make him drop the pursuit

My Art of Virtue has also its instruments and teaches the manner of
using them Christians are directed to have faith in Christ as the
effectual means of obtaining the change they desire It may when
sufficiently strong be effectual with many for a full opinion that a
Teacher is infinitely wise good and powerful and that he will
certainly reward and punish the obedient and disobedient must give
great weight to his precepts and make them much more attended to by his
disciples But many have this faith in so weak a degree that it does
not produce the effect Our Art of Virtue may therefore be of great
service to those whose faith is unhappily not so strong and may come in
aid of its weakness Such as are naturally well disposed and have been
so carefully educated as that good habits have been early established
and bad ones prevented have less need of this art but all may be more
or less benefited by it It is in short to be adapted for universal
use I imagine what I have now been writing will seem to savour of great
presumption I must therefore speedily finish my little piece and
communicate the manuscript to you that you may judge whether it is
possible to make good such pretensions I shall at the same time hope
for the benefit of your corrections I am c

TO MISS MARY STEVENSON

                                    Craven Street June  

DEAR POLLY

Tis a very sensible Question you ask how the Air can affect the
Barometer when its Opening appears covered with Wood If indeed it was
so closely covered as to admit of no Communication of the outward Air to
the Surface of the Mercury the Change of Weight in the Air could not
possibly affect it But the least Crevice is sufficient for the Purpose
a Pinhole will do the Business And if you could look behind the Frame
to which your Barometer is fixed you would certainly find some small
Opening

There are indeed some Barometers in which the Body of Mercury at the
lower End is containd in a close Leather Bag and so the Air cannot
come into immediate Contact with the Mercury yet the same Effect is
producd For the Leather being flexible when the Bag is pressd by
any additional Weight of Air it contracts and the Mercury is forced up
into the Tube when the Air becomes lighter and its Pressure less the
Weight of the Mercury prevails and it descends again into the Bag

Your Observation on what you have lately read concerning Insects is very
just and solid Superficial Minds are apt to despise those who make that
Part of the Creation their Study as mere Triflers but certainly the
World has been much obligd to them Under the Care and Management of
Man the Labours of the little Silkworm afford Employment and
Subsistence to Thousands of Families and become an immense Article of
Commerce The Bee too yields us its delicious Honey and its Wax
useful to a Multitude of Purposes Another Insect it is said produces
the Cochineal from whence we have our rich Scarlet Dye The Usefulness
of the Cantharides or Spanish Flies in Medicine is known to all and
Thousands owe their Lives to that Knowledge By human Industry and
Observation other Properties of other Insects may possibly be hereafter
discovered and of equal Utility A thorough Acquaintance with the
Nature of these little Creatures may also enable Mankind to prevent the
Increase of such as are noxious or secure us against the Mischiefs they
occasion These Things doubtless your Books make mention of I can only
add a particular late Instance which I had from a Swedish Gentleman of
good Credit In the green Timber intended for Shipbuilding at the
Kings Yards in that Country a kind of Worms were found which every
year became more numerous and more pernicious so that the Ships were
greatly damagd before they came into Use The King sent Linnus the
great Naturalist from Stockholm to enquire into the Affair and see if
the Mischief was capable of any Remedy He found on Examination that
the Worm was produced from a small Egg deposited in the little
Roughnesses on the Surface of the Wood by a particular kind of Fly or
Beetle from whence the Worm as soon as it was hatched began to eat
into the Substance of the Wood and after some time came out again a Fly
of the Parent kind and so the Species increased The season in which
this Fly laid its Eggs Linnus knew to be about a Fortnight I think
in the Month of May and at no other time of the Year He therefore
advisd that some Days before that Season all the green Timber should
be thrown into the Water and kept under Water till the Season was over
Which being done by the Kings Order the Flies missing their usual
Nest could not increase and the Species was either destroyd or went
elsewhere and the Wood was effectually preserved for after the first
Year it became too dry and hard for their purpose

There is however a prudent Moderation to be used in Studies of this
kind The Knowledge of Nature may be ornamental and it may be useful
but if to attain an Eminence in that we neglect the Knowledge and
Practice of essential Duties we deserve Reprehension For there is no
Rank in Natural Knowledge of equal Dignity and Importance with that of
being a good Parent a good Child a good Husband or Wife a good
Neighbour or Friend a good Subject or Citizen that is in short a
good Christian Nicholas Gimcrack therefore who neglected the Care of
his Family to pursue Butterflies was a just Object of Ridicule and we
must give him up as fair Game to the satyrist

Adieu my dear Friend and believe me ever
                                       Yours affectionately

TO MRS DEBORAH FRANKLIN

                                           London June  

MY DEAR CHILD

I wrote a Line to you by the Pacquet to let you know we were well and
I promisd to write you fully by Capt Budden and answer all your
Letters which I accordingly now sit down to do I am concernd that so
much Trouble should be given you by idle Reports concerning me Be
satisfied my dear that while I have my Senses and God vouchsafes me
his Protection I shall do nothing unworthy the Character of an honest
Man and one that loves his Family

I have not yet seen Mr Beatty nor do I know where to write to him He
forwarded your Letter to me from Ireland The Paragraph of your Letter
inserted in the Papers related to the Negro School I gave it to the
Gentlemen concernd as it was a Testimony in favour of their pious
Design But I did not expect they would have printed it with your Name
They have since chosen me one of the Society and I am at present
Chairman for the current year I enclose you an Account of their
Proceedings

I did not receive the Prospect of Quebec which you mention that you
sent me Peter continues with me and behaves as well as I can expect
in a Country where there are many Occasions of spoiling Servants if
they are ever so good He has as few Faults as most of them and I see
with only one Eye and hear only with one Ear so we rub on pretty
comfortably King that you enquire after is not with us He ran away
from our House near two Years ago while we were absent in the Country
But was soon found in Suffolk where he had been taken in the Service of
a Lady that was very fond of the Merit of making him a Christian and
contributing to his Education and Improvement As he was of little Use
and often in Mischief Billy consented to her keeping him while we stay
in England So the Lady sent him to School has him taught to read and
write to play on the Violin and French Horn with some other
Accomplishments more useful in a Servant Whether she will finally be
willing to part with him or persuade Billy to sell him to her I know
not In the mean time he is no Expence to us The dried Venison was very
acceptable and I thank you for it We have had it constantly shavd to
eat with our Bread and Butter for Breakfast and this Week saw the last
of it The Bacon still holds out for we are choice of it Some Rashers
of it yesterday relishd a Dish of Green Pease Mrs Stevenson thinks
there was never any in England so good The smokd Beef was also
excellent

The Accounts you give me of the Marriages of our friends are very
agreeable I love to hear of every thing that tends to increase the
Number of good People You cannot conceive how shamefully the Mode here
is a single Life One can scarce be in the Company of a Dozen Men of
Circumstance and Fortune but what it is odds that you find on enquiry
eleven of them are single The great Complaint is the excessive
Expensiveness of English Wives

I am extreamly concernd with you at the Misfortune of our Friend Mr
Griffith How could it possibly happen Twas a terrible Fire that of
Boston I shall contribute here towards the Relief of the Sufferers Our
Relations have escapd I believe generally but some of my particular
Friends must have sufferd greatly

I think you will not complain this Year as you did the last of being
so long without a Letter I have wrote to you very frequently and shall
not be so much out of the Way of writing this Summer as I was the last
I hope our friend Bartram is safely returnd to his Family Remember me
to him in the kindest Manner

Poor David Edwards died this Day Week of a Consumption I had a Letter
from a Friend of his acquainting me that he had been long ill and
incapable of doing his Business and was at Board in the Country I
feard he might be in Straits as he never was prudent enough to lay up
any thing So I wrote to him immediately that if he had occasion he
might draw on me for Five Guineas But he died before my Letter got to
hand I hear the Woman at whose House he long lodgd and boarded has
buried him and taken all he left which could not be much and there are
some small Debts unpaid He maintained a good Character at Bury where
he lived some years and was well respected to my Knowledge by some
Persons of Note there I wrote to you before that we saw him at Bury
when we went thro Suffolk into Norfolk the Year before last I hope
his good Father my old Friend continues well

Give my Duty to Mother and Love to my dear Sally Remember me
affectionately to all Enquiring Friends and believe me ever my dearest
Debby your loving Husband

TO JARED INGERSOLL

                                 Philadelphia December  

DEAR SIR

I thank you for your kind congratulations It gives me pleasure to hear
from an old friend it will give me much more pleasure to see him I
hope therefore nothing will prevent the journey you propose for next
summer and the favour you intend me of a visit I believe I must make a
journey early in the spring to Virginia but purpose being back again
before the hot weather You will be kind enough to let me know
beforehand what time you expect to be here that I may not be out of the
way for that would mortify me exceedingly

I should be glad to know what it is that distinguishes Connecticut
religion from common religion Communicate if you please some of these
particulars that you think will amuse me as a virtuoso When I travelled
in Flanders I thought of your excessively strict observation of Sunday
and that a man could hardly travel on that day among you upon his lawful
occasions without hazard of punishment while where I was every one
travelled if he pleased or diverted himself in any other way and in
the afternoon both high and low went to the play or the opera where
there was plenty of singing fiddling and dancing I looked around for
Gods judgments but saw no signs of them The cities were well built
and full of inhabitants the markets filled with plenty the people
well favoured and well clothed the fields well tilled the cattle fat
and strong the fences houses and windows all in repair and no Old
Tenor anywhere in the country which would almost make one suspect that
the Deity is not so angry at that offence as a New England Justice

I left our friend Mr Jackson well and I had the great pleasure of
finding my little family well when I came home and my friends as
cordial and more numerous than ever May every prosperity attend you and
yours I am dear friend yours affectionately

TO MISS MARY STEVENSON

                                        Philada March  

MY DEAR POLLEY

Your pleasing Favour of Nov  is now before me It found me as you
supposd it would happy with my American Friends and Family about me
and it made me more happy in showing me that I am not yet forgotten by
the dear Friends I left in England And indeed why should I fear they
will ever forget me when I feel so strongly that I shall ever remember
them

I sympathise with you sincerely in your Grief at the Separation from
your old Friend Miss Pitt The Reflection that she is going to be more
happy when she leaves you might comfort you if the Case was likely to
be so circumstancd but when the Country and Company she has been
educated in and those she is removing to are compared one cannot
possibly expect it I sympathize no less with you in your Joys But it
is not merely on your Account that I rejoice at the Recovery of your
dear Dollys Health I love that dear good Girl myself and I love her
other Friends I am therefore made happy by what must contribute so
much to the Happiness of them all Remember me to her and to every one
of that worthy and amiable Family most affectionately

Remember me in the same manner to your and my good Doctor and Mrs
Hawkesworth You have lately you tell me had the Pleasure of
spending three Days with them at Mr Stanleys It was a sweet Society
I too once partook of that same Pleasure and can therefore feel what
you must have felt Remember me also to Mr and Mrs Stanley and to
Miss Arlond

Of all the enviable Things England has I envy it most its People Why
should that petty Island which compard to America is but like a
steppingStone in a Brook scarce enough of it above Water to keep ones
Shoes dry why I say should that little Island enjoy in almost every
Neighbourhood more sensible virtuous and elegant Minds than we can
collect in ranging  Leagues of our vast forests But tis said the
Arts delight to travel Westward You have effectually defended us in
this glorious War and in time you will improve us After the first
Cares for the Necessaries of Life are over we shall come to think of
the Embellishments Already some of our young Geniuses begin to lisp
Attempts at Painting Poetry and Musick We have a young Painter now
studying at Rome Some specimens of our Poetry I send you which if
Dr Hawkesworths fine Taste cannot approve his good Heart will at
least excuse The Manuscript Piece is by a young Friend of mine and was
occasiond by the Loss of one of his Friends who lately made a Voyage
to Antigua to settle some Affairs previous to an intended Marriage with
an amiable young Lady here but unfortunately died there I send it to
you because the Author is a great Admirer of Mr Stanleys musical
Compositions and has adapted this Piece to an Air in the th Concerto
of that Gentleman the sweetly solemn Movement of which he is quite in
Raptures with He has attempted to compose a Recitativo for it but
not being able to satisfy himself in the Bass wishes I could get it
supplyd If Mr Stanley would condescend to do that for him thro your
Intercession he would esteem it as one of the highest Honours and it
would make him excessively happy You will say that a Recitativo can
be but a poor Specimen of our Music Tis the best and all I have at
present but you may see better hereafter

I hope Mr Ralphs Affairs are mended since you wrote I know he had
some Expectations when I came away from a Hand that would help him
He has Merit and one would think ought not to be so unfortunate

I do not wonder at the behaviour you mention of Dr Smith towards me
for I have long since known him thoroughly I made that Man my Enemy by
doing him too much Kindness Tis the honestest Way of acquiring an
Enemy And since tis convenient to have at least one Enemy who by his
Readiness to revile one on all Occasions may make one careful of ones
Conduct I shall keep him an Enemy for that purpose and shall observe
your good Mothers Advice never again to receive him as a Friend She
once admird the benevolent Spirit breathd in his Sermons She will now
see the Justness of the Lines your Laureat Whitehead addresses to his
Poets and which I now address to her

    Full many a peevish envious slanderous Elf
     Is in his Works Benevolence itself
     For all Mankind unknown his Bosom heaves
     He only injures those with whom he lives
     Read then the Mandoes Truth his Actions guide
     Exempt from Petulance exempt from Pride
     To social Duties does his Heart attend
     As Son as Father Husband Brother Friend
     Do those who know him love him If they do
     Youve my Permission you may love him too

Nothing can please me more than to see your philosophical Improvements
when you have Leisure to communicate them to me I still owe you a long
Letter on that Subject which I shall pay I am vexd with Mr James
that he has been so dilatory in Mr Maddisons Armonica I was unlucky
in both the Workmen that I permitted to undertake making those
Instruments The first was fanciful and never could work to the
purpose because he was ever conceiving some new Improvement that
answerd no End The other I doubt is absolutely idle I have
recommended a Number to him from hence but must stop my hand

Adieu my dear Polly and believe me as ever with the sincerest Esteem
and Regard your truly affectionate Friend and humble Servant

                                                     B FRANKLIN

PS My love to Mrs Tickell and Mrs Rooke and to Pitty when you
write to her Mrs Franklin and Sally desire to be affectionately
rememberd to you I find the printed Poetry I intended to enclose will
be too bulky to send per the Packet I shall send it by a Ship that
goes shortly from hence



TO JOHN FOTHERGILL MD

                                                  March  

DEAR DOCTOR

I received your favour of the th of December It was a great deal for
one to write whose time was so little his own By the way when do you
intend to liveie to enjoy life When will you retire to your
villa give yourself repose delight in viewing the operations of nature
in the vegetable creation assist her in her works get your ingenious
friends at times about you make them happy with your conversation and
enjoy theirs or if alone amuse yourself with your books and elegant
collections

To be hurried about perpetually from one sick chamber to another is not
living Do you please yourself with the fancy that you are doing good
You are mistaken Half the lives you save are not worth saving as being
useless and almost all the other half ought not to be saved as being
mischievous Does your conscience never hint to you the impiety of being
in constant warfare against the plans of Providence Disease was
intended as the punishment of intemperence sloth and other vices and
the example of that punishment was intended to promote and strengthen
the opposite virtues But here you step in officiously with your Art
disappoint those wise intentions of nature and make men safe in their
excesses whereby you seem to me to be of just the same service to
society as some favourite first minister who out of the great
benevolence of his heart should procure pardons of all criminals that
applied to him only think of the consequences

You tell me the Quakers are charged on your side of the water with
being by their aggressions the cause of the war Would you believe it
that they are charged here not with offending the Indians and thereby
provoking the war but with gaining their friendship by presents
supplying them privately with arms and ammunition and engaging them to
fall upon and murder the poor white people on the frontiers Would you
think it possible that thousands even here should be made to believe
this and many hundreds of them be raised in arms not only to kill some
converted Indians supposed to be under the Quakers protection but to
punish the Quakers who were supposed to give that protection Would you
think these people audacious enough to avow such designs in a public
declaration sent to the Governor Would you imagine that innocent
Quakers men of fortune and character should think it necessary to fly
for safety out of Philadelphia into the Jersies fearing the violence of
such armed mobs and confiding little in the power or inclination of the
government to protect them And would you imagine that strong suspicions
now prevail that those mobs after committing so barbarous murders
hitherto unpunished are privately tampered with to be made instruments
of government to awe the Assembly into proprietary measures And yet all
this has happened within a few weeks past

More wonders You know that I dont love the proprietary and that he
does not love me Our totally different tempers forbid it You might
therefore expect that the late new appointments of one of his family
would find me ready for opposition And yet when his nephew arrived our
Governor I considered government as government and paid him all
respect gave him on all occasions my best advice promoted in the
Assembly a ready compliance with every thing he proposed or recommended
and when those daring rioters encouraged by general approbation of the
populace treated his proclamation with contempt I drew my pen in the
cause wrote a pamphlet that I have sent you to render the rioters
unpopular promoted an association to support the authority of the
Government and defend the Governor by taking arms signed it first
myself and was followed by several hundreds who took arms accordingly
The Governor offered me the command of them but I chose to carry a
musket and strengthen his authority by setting an example of obedience
to his order And would you think it this proprietary Governor did me
the honour in an alarm to run to my house at midnight with his
counsellors at his heels for advice and made it his headquarters for
some time And within four and twenty hours your old friend was a
common soldier a counsellor a kind of dictator an ambassador to the
country mob and on his returning home nobody again All this has
happened in a few weeks

More wonders The Assembly received a Governor of the Proprietary family
with open arms addressed him with sincere expressions of kindness and
respect opened their purses to them and presented him with six hundred
pounds made a Riot Act and prepared a Militia Bill immediately at his
instance granted supplies and did everything that he requested and
promised themselves great happiness under his administration But
suddenly his dropping all inquiries after the murderers and his
answering the disputes of the rioters privately and refusing the
presence of the Assembly who were equally concerned in the matters
contained in their remonstrance brings him under suspicion his
insulting the Assembly without the least provocation by charging them
with disloyalty and with making an infringement on the Kings
prerogatives only because they had presumed to name in a bill offered
for his assent a trifling officer somewhat like one of your
tollgatherers at a turnpike without consulting him and his refusing
several of their bills or proposing amendments needless disgusting

These things bring him and his government into sudden contempt All
regard for him in the Assembly is lost All hopes of happiness under a
Proprietary Government are at an end It has now scarce authority enough
to keep the common peace and was another to come I question though a
dozen men were sufficient whether one could find so many in
Philadelphia willing to rescue him or his Attorney General I wont say
from hanging but from any common insult All this too happened in a
few weeks

In fine everything seems in this country once the land of peace and
order to be running fast into anarchy and confusion But we hope there
is virtue enough in your great nation to support a good Prince in the
execution of a good government and the exercise of his just prerogatives
against all the attempts of unreasonable faction I have been already
too long Adieu my dear friend and believe me ever yours
affectionately

TO SARAH FRANKLIN

                      Reedy Island  at night November  

MY DEAR SALLY

We got down here at sunset having taken in more live stock at
Newcastle with some other things we wanted Our good friends Mr
Galloway Mr Wharton and Mr James came with me in the ship from
Chester to Newcastle and went ashore there It was kind to favour me
with their good company as far as they could The affectionate leave
taken of me by so many friends at Chester was very endearing God bless
them and all Pennsylvania

My dear child the natural prudence and goodness of heart God has blest
you with make it less necessary for me to be particular in giving you
advice I shall therefore only say that the more attentively dutiful
and tender you are towards your good mamma the more you will recommend
yourself to me But why should I mention me when you have so much
higher a promise in the commandments that such conduct will recommend
you to the favour of God You know I have many enemies all indeed on
the public account for I cannot recollect that I have in a private
capacity given just cause of offence to any one whatever yet they are
enemies and very bitter ones and you must expect their enmity will
extend in some degree to you so that your slightest indiscretions will
be magnified into crimes in order the more sensibly to wound and
afflict me It is therefore the more necessary for you to be extremely
circumspect in all your behaviour that no advantage may be given to
their malevolence

Go constantly to church whoever preaches The act of devotion in the
Common Prayer Book is your principal business there and if properly
attended to will do more towards amending the heart than sermons
generally can do For they were composed by men of much greater piety
and wisdom than our common composers of sermons can pretend to be and
therefore I wish you would never miss the prayer days yet I do not mean
you should despise sermons even of the preachers you dislike for the
discourse is often much better than the man as sweet and clear waters
come through very dirty earth I am the more particular on this head as
you seemed to express a little before I came away some inclination to
leave our church which I would not have you do

For the rest I would only recommend to you in my absence to acquire
those useful accomplishments arithmetic and bookkeeping This you might
do with ease if you would resolve not to see company on the hours you
set apart for those studies

We expect to be at sea tomorrow if this wind holds after which I
shall have no opportunity of writing to you till I arrive if it please
God I do arrive in England I pray that his blessing may attend you
which is worth more than a thousand of mine though they are never
wanting Give my love to your brother and sister as I cannot write
to them and remember me affectionately to the young ladies your
friends and to our good neighbours I am my dear child your
affectionate father

From A NARRATIVE OF THE LATE MASSACRES

IN LANCASTER COUNTY OF A NUMBER OF INDIANS FRIENDS OF THIS PROVINCE
BY PERSONS UNKNOWN WITH SOME OBSERVATIONS ON THE SAME



 On Wednesday the th of December  Fiftyseven Men from
some of our Frontier Townships who had projected the Destruction of
this little Commonwealth came all well mounted and armed with
Firelocks Hangers and Hatchets having travelled through the Country in
the Night to Conestogoe Manor There they surrounded the small
Village of Indian Huts and just at Break of Day broke into them all
at once Only three Men two Women and a young Boy were found at home
the rest being out among the neighbouring White People some to sell the
Baskets Brooms and Bowls they manufactured and others on other
Occasions These poor defenceless Creatures were immediately fired upon
stabbed and hatcheted to Death The good Shehaes among the rest cut
to Pieces in his Bed All of them were scalped and otherwise horribly
mangled Then their Huts were set on Fire and most of them burnt down
When the Troop pleased with their own Conduct and Bravery but enraged
that any of the poor Indians had escaped the Massacre rode off and
in small Parties by different Roads went home

The universal Concern of the neighbouring White People on hearing of
this Event and the Lamentations of the younger Indians when they
returned and saw the Desolation and the butchered halfburnt Bodies of
their murdered Parents and other Relations cannot well be expressed

                                   

Notwithstanding this Proclamation by the Governor those cruel men
again assembled themselves and hearing that the remaining fourteen
Indians were in the Workhouse at Lancaster they suddenly appeared
in that Town on the th of December Fifty of them armed as before
dismounting went directly to the Workhouse and by Violence broke open
the Door and entered with the utmost Fury in their Countenances When
the poor Wretches saw they had no Protection nigh nor could possibly
escape and being without the least Weapon for Defence they divided
into their little Families the Children clinging to the Parents they
fell on their Knees protested their Innocence declared their Love to
the English and that in their whole Lives they had never done them
Injury and in this Posture they all received the Hatchet Men Women
and little Children were every one inhumanly murderedin cold Blood

The barbarous Men who committed the atrocious Fact in defiance of
Government of all Laws human and divine and to the eternal Disgrace of
their Country and Colour then mounted their Horses huzzad in Triumph
as if they had gained a Victory and rode offunmolested

The Bodies of the Murdered were then brought out and exposed in the
Street till a Hole could be made in the Earth to receive and cover
them

But the Wickedness cannot be covered the Guilt will lie on the whole
Land till Justice is done on the Murderers THE BLOOD OF THE INNOCENT
WILL CRY TO HEAVEN FOR VENGEANCE

                                   

If an Indian injures me does it follow that I may revenge that Injury
on all Indians It is well known that Indians are of different
Tribes Nations and Languages as well as the White People In Europe
if the French who are White People should injure the Dutch are
they to revenge it on the English because they too are White People
The only Crime of these poor Wretches seems to have been that they had
a reddishbrown Skin and black Hair and some People of that Sort it
seems had murdered some of our Relations If it be right to kill Men
for such a Reason then should any Man with a freckled Face and red
Hair kill a Wife or Child of mine it would be right for me to revenge
it by killing all the freckled redhaired Men Women and Children I
could afterwards anywhere meet with

But it seems these People think they have a better Justification
nothing less than the Word of God With the Scriptures in their Hands
and Mouths they can set at nought that express Command Thou shalt do
no Murder and justify their Wickedness by the Command given Joshua
to destroy the Heathen Horrid Perversion of Scripture and of Religion
To father the worst of Crimes on the God of Peace and Love Even the
Jews to whom that particular Commission was directed spared the
Gibeonites on Account of their Faith once given The Faith of this
Government has been frequently given to those Indians but that did
not avail them with People who despise Government

We pretend to be Christians and from the superior Light we enjoy
ought to exceed Heathens Turks Saracens Moors Negroes and
Indians in the Knowledge and Practice of what is right I will
endeavour to show by a few Examples from Books and History the Sense
those People have had of such Actions

Homer wrote his Poem called the Odyssey some Hundred Years before
the Birth of Christ He frequently speaks of what he calls not only the
Duties but the Sacred Rites of Hospitality exercised towards
Strangers while in our House or Territory as including besides all
the common Circumstances of Entertainment full Safety and Protection of
Person from all Danger of Life from all Injuries and even Insults
The Rites of Hospitality were called sacred because the Stranger the
Poor and the Weak when they applied for Protection and Relief were
from the Religion of those Times supposed to be sent by the Deity to
try the Goodness of Men and that he would avenge the Injuries they
might receive where they ought to have been protected These Sentiments
therefore influenced the Manners of all Ranks of People even the
meanest for we find that when Ulysses came as a poor Stranger to
the Hut of Eumus the Swineherd and his great Dogs ran out to tear the
ragged Man Eumus drave them away with Stones and

    Unhappy Stranger thus the faithful Swain
     Began with Accent gracious and humane
     What Sorrow had been mine if at my Gate
     Thy revrend Age had met a shameful Fate
     But enter this my homely Roof and see
     Our Woods not void of Hospitality
     He said and seconding the kind Request
     With friendly Step precedes the unknown Guest
     A shaggy Goats soft Hide beneath him spread
     And with fresh Rushes heapd an ample Bed
     Joy touchd the Heros tender Soul to find
     So just Reception from a Heart so kind
     And Oh ye Gods with all your Blessings grace
     He thus broke forth this Friend of human Race
       The Swain replyd It never was our guise
     To slight the Poor or aught humane despise
     For Jove unfolds the hospitable Door
     Tis Jove that sends the Stranger and the Poor

These Heathen People thought that after a Breach of the Rites of
Hospitality a Curse from Heaven would attend them in every thing they
did and even their honest Industry in their Callings would fail of
Success Thus when Ulysses tells Eumus who doubted the Truth of
what he related If I deceive you in this I should deserve Death and
I consent that you should put me to Death Eumus rejects the
Proposal as what would be attended with both Infamy and Misfortune
saying ironically

    Doubtless O Guest great Laud and Praise were mine
     If after social Rites and Gifts bestowd
     I staind my Hospitable Hearth with Blood
     How would the Gods my righteous Toils succeed
     And bless the Hand that made a Stranger bleed
     No more

Even an open Enemy in the Heat of Battle throwing down his Arms
submitting to his Foe and asking Life and Protection was supposed to
acquire an immediate Right to that Protection Thus one describes his
being saved when his Party was defeated

    We turnd to Flight the gathring Vengeance spread
     On all Parts round and Heaps on Heaps lie dead
     The radiant Helmet from my Brows unlacd
     And lo on Earth my Shield and Javelin cast
     I meet the Monarch with a Suppliants Face
     Approach his Chariot and his Knees embrace
     He heard he savd he placd me at his Side
     My State he pityd and my Tears he dryd
     Restraind the Rage the vengeful Foe expressd
     And turnd the deadly Weapons from my Breast
     Pious to guard the Hospitable Rite
     And fearing Jove whom Mercys Works delight

The Suitors of Penelope are by the same ancient Poet described as a
sett of lawless Men who were regardless of the sacred Rites of
Hospitality And therefore when the Queen was informed they were slain
and that by Ulysses she not believing that Ulysses was returned
says

    Ah no some God the Suitors Deaths decreed
     Some God descends and by his Hand they bleed
     Blind to contemn the Strangers righteous Cause
     And violate all hospitable Laws
              The Powers they defyd
     But Heavn is just and by a God they dyd

                                   

Now I am about to mention something of Indians I beg that I may not
be understood as framing Apologies for all Indians I am far from
desiring to lessen the laudable Spirit of Resentment in my Countrymen
against those now at War with us so far as it is justified by their
Perfidy and Inhumanity I would only observe that the Six Nations as
a Body have kept Faith with the English ever since we knew them now
near an Hundred Years and that the governing Part of those People have
had Notions of Honour whatever may be the Case with the Rumdebauched
Tradercorrupted Vagabonds and Thieves on the Sasquehannah and Ohio
at present in Arms against us

                                   

Unhappy People to have lived in such Times and by such Neighbours We
have seen that they would have been safer among the ancient Heathens
with whom the Rites of Hospitality were sacred They would have been
considered as Guests of the Publick and the Religion of the Country
would have operated in their Favour But our Frontier People call
themselves Christians They would have been safer if they had
submitted to the Turks for ever since Mahomets Reproof to
Khaled even the cruel Turks never kill Prisoners in cold Blood
These were not even Prisoners But what is the Example of Turks to
Scripture Christians They would have been safer though they had been
taken in actual War against the Saracens if they had once drank Water
with them These were not taken in War against us and have drank with
us and we with them for Fourscore Years But shall we compare
Saracens to Christians

They would have been safer among the Moors in Spain though they had
been Murderers of Sons if Faith had once been pledged to them and a
Promise of Protection given But these have had the Faith of the
English given to them many Times by the Government and in Reliance
on that Faith they lived among us and gave us the Opportunity of
murdering them However what was honourable in Moors may not be a
Rule to us for we are Christians They would have been safer it seems
among Popish Spaniards even if Enemies and delivered into their
Hands by a Tempest These were not Enemies they were born among us and
yet we have killed them all But shall we imitate idolatrous Papists
we that are enlightened Protestants They would have even been safer
among the Negroes of Africa where at least one manly Soul would
have been found with Sense Spirit and Humanity enough to stand in
their Defence But shall Whitemen and Christians act like a Pagan
Negroe In short it appears that they would have been safe in any Part
of the known World except in the Neighbourhood of the CHRISTIAN WHITE
SAVAGES of Peckstang and Donesgall

O ye unhappy Perpetrators of this horrid Wickedness reflect a Moment
on the Mischief ye have done the Disgrace ye have brought on your
Country on your Religion and your Bible on your Families and
Children Think on the Destruction of your captivated Countryfolks now
among the wild Indians which probably may follow in Resentment of
your Barbarity Think on the Wrath of the United Five Nations
hitherto our Friends but now provoked by your murdering one of their
Tribes in Danger of becoming our bitter Enemies Think of the mild and
good Government you have so audaciously insulted the Laws of your King
your Country and your God that you have broken the infamous Death
that hangs over your Heads for Justice though slow will come at last
All good People everywhere detest your Actions You have imbrued your
Hands in innocent Blood how will you make them clean The dying Shrieks
and Groans of the Murdered will often sound in your Ears Their
Spectres will sometimes attend you and affright even your innocent
Children Fly where you will your Consciences will go with you Talking
in your Sleep shall betray you in the Delirium of a Fever you
yourselves shall make your own Wickedness known

                                   

Let us rouze ourselves for Shame and redeem the Honour of our Province
from the Contempt of its Neighbours let all good Men join heartily and
unanimously in Support of the Laws and in strengthening the Hands of
Government that JUSTICE may be done the Wicked punished and the
Innocent protected otherwise we can as a People expect no Blessing
from Heaven there will be no Security for our Persons or Properties
Anarchy and Confusion will prevail over all and Violence without
Judgment dispose of every Thing

                                   



TO THE EDITOR OF A NEWSPAPER

                                          Monday May  

SIR

In your Paper of Wednesday last an ingenious Correspondent that calls
himself THE SPECTATOR and dates from Pimlico under the Guise of Good
Will to the Newswriters whom he calls an useful Body of Men in this
great City has in my Opinion artfully attempted to turn them  their
Works into Ridicule wherein if he could succeed great Injury might be
done to the Public as well as to those good People

Supposing Sir that the We hears they give us of this  tother
intended Voyage or Tour of this  tother great Personage were mere
Inventions yet they at least offer us an innocent Amusement while we
read and useful Matter of Conversation when we are disposd to
converse

Englishmen Sir are too apt to be silent when they have nothing to say
too apt to be sullen when they are silent and when they are sullen to
hang themselves But by these We hears we are supplied with abundant
funds of Discourse we discuss the Motives for such Voyages the
Probability of their being undertaken and the Practicability of their
Execution Here we display our Judgment in Politics our Knowledge of
the Interests of Princes and our Skill in Geography and if we have
it show our Dexterity moreover in Argumentation In the mean time the
tedious Hour is killd we go home pleasd with the Applauses we have
receivd from others or at least with those we secretly give to
ourselves We sleep soundly  live on to the Comfort of our Families
But Sir I beg leave to say that all the Articles of News that seem
improbable are not mere Inventions Some of them I can assure you on
the Faith of a Traveller are serious Truths And here quitting Mr
Spectator of Pimlico give me leave to instance the various numberless
Accounts the Newswriters have given us with so much honest Zeal for the
welfare of Poor Old England of the establishing Manufactures in the
Colonies to the Prejudice of those of this Kingdom It is objected by
superficial Readers who yet pretend to some Knowledge of those
Countries that such Establishments are not only improbable but
impossible for that their Sheep have but little Wooll not in the whole
sufficient for a Pair of Stockings a Year to each Inhabitant and that
from the Universal Dearness of Labour among them the Working of Iron
and other Materials except in some few coarse Instances is
impracticable to any Advantage

Dear Sir do not let us suffer ourselves to be amusd with such
groundless Objections The very Tails of the American Sheep are so laden
with Wooll that each has a little Car or Waggon on four little Wheels
to support  keep it from trailing on the Ground Would they caulk
their Ships would they fill their Beds would they even litter their
Horses with Wooll if it were not both plenty and cheap And what
signifies Dearness of Labour when an English Shilling passes for five
and Twenty Their engaging  Silk Throwsters here in one Week for New
York was treated as a Fable because forsooth they have no Silk
there to throw Those who made this Objection perhaps did not know
that at the same time the Agents from the King of Spain were at Quebec
to contract for  Pieces of Cannon to be made there for the
Fortification of Mexico and at N York engaging the annual Supply of
woven FloorCarpets for their West India Houses other Agents from the
Emperor of China were at Boston treating about an Exchange of raw Silk
for Wooll to be carried in Chinese Junks through the Straits of
Magellan

And yet all this is as certainly true as the Account said to be from
Quebec in all the Papers of last Week that the Inhabitants of Canada
are making Preparations for a Cod and Whale Fishery this Summer in the
upper Lakes Ignorant People may object that the upper Lakes are fresh
and that Cod and Whale are Salt Water Fish But let them know Sir that
Cod like other Fish when attackd by their Enemies fly into any Water
where they can be safest that Whales when they have a mind to eat Cod
pursue them wherever they fly and that the grand Leap of the Whale in
that Chase up the Fall of Niagara is esteemed by all who have seen it
as one of the finest Spectacles in Nature Really Sir the World is
grown too incredulous It is like the Pendulum ever swinging from one
Extream to another Formerly every thing printed was believed because
it was in print Now Things seem to be disbelieved for just the very
same Reason Wise Men wonder at the present Growth of Infidelity They
should have considerd when they taught People to doubt the Authority
of Newspapers and the Truth of Predictions in Almanacks that the next
Step might be a Disbelief in the well vouchd Accts of Ghosts Witches
and Doubts even of the Truths of the Creed

Thus much I thought it necessary to say in favour of an honest Set of
Writers whose comfortable Living depends on collecting  supplying the
Printers with News at the small Price of Sixpence an Article and who
always show their Regard to Truth by contradicting in a subsequent

TO LORD KAMES

                             Craven Street London June  

MY DEAR LORD

 In my passage to America I read your excellent work the Elements
of Criticism in which I found great entertainment much to admire and
nothing to reprove I only wished you had examined more fully the
subject of Music and demonstrated that the pleasure which artists feel
in hearing much of that composed in the modern taste is not the natural
pleasure arising from melody or harmony of sounds but of the same kind
with the pleasure we feel on seeing the surprising feats of tumblers and
ropedancers who execute difficult things For my part I take this to
be really the case and suppose it is the reason why those who being
unpractised in music and therefore unacquainted with those difficulties
have little or no pleasure in hearing this music Many pieces of it are
mere compositions of tricks I have sometimes at a concert attended by
a common audience placed myself so as to see all their faces and
observed no signs of pleasure in them during the performance of a great
part that was admired by the performers themselves while a plain old
Scottish tune which they disdained and could scarcely be prevailed
on to play gave manifest and general delight

Give me leave on this occasion to extend a little the sense of your
position that Melody and Harmony are separately agreeable and in
union delightful and to give it as my opinion that the reason why the
Scotch tunes have lived so long and will probably live for ever if
they escape being stifled in modern affected ornament is merely this
that they are really compositions of melody and harmony united or
rather that their melody is harmony I mean the simple tunes sung by a
single voice As this will appear paradoxical I must explain my
meaning In common acceptation indeed only an agreeable succession
of sounds is called Melody and only the coexistence of agreeing
sounds Harmony But since the memory is capable of retaining for
some moments a perfect idea of the pitch of a past sound so as to
compare with it the pitch of a succeeding sound and judge truly of
their agreement or disagreement there may and does arise from thence a
sense of harmony between the present and past sounds equally pleasing
with that between two present sounds

Now the construction of the old Scotch tunes is this that almost every
succeeding emphatical note is a third a fifth an octave or in short
some note that is in concord with the preceding note Thirds are chiefly
used which are very pleasing concords I use the word emphatical to
distinguish those notes which have a stress laid on them in singing the
tune from the lighter connecting notes that serve merely like grammar
articles to tack the others together

That we have a most perfect idea of a sound just past I might appeal to
all acquainted with music who know how easy it is to repeat a sound in
the same pitch with one just heard In tuning an instrument a good ear
can as easily determine that two strings are in unison by sounding them
separately as by sounding them together their disagreement is also as
easily I believe I may say more easily and better distinguished when
sounded separately for when sounded together though you know by the
beating that one is higher than the other you cannot tell which it is
I have ascribed to memory the ability of comparing the pitch of a
present tone with that of one past But if there should be as possibly
there may be something in the ear similar to what we find in the eye
that ability would not be entirely owing to memory Possibly the
vibrations given to the auditory nerves by a particular sound may
actually continue some time after the cause of those vibrations is past
and the agreement or disagreement of a subsequent sound become by
comparison with them more discernible For the impression made on the
visual nerves by a luminous object will continue for twenty or thirty
seconds Sitting in a room look earnestly at the middle of a window a
little while when the day is bright and then shut your eyes the figure
of the window will still remain in the eye and so distinct that you may
count the panes

A remarkable circumstance attending this experiment is that the
impression of forms is better retained than that of colors for after
the eyes are shut when you first discern the image of the window the
panes appear dark and the cross bars of the sashes with the window
frames and walls appear white or bright but if you still add to the
darkness in the eyes by covering them with your hand the reverse
instantly takes place the panes appear luminous and the cross bars
dark And by removing the hand they are again reversed This I know not
how to account for Nor for the following that after looking long
through green spectacles the white paper of a book will on first taking
them off appear to have a blush of red and after long looking through
red glasses a greenish cast this seems to intimate a relation between
green and red not yet explained

Farther when we consider by whom these ancient tunes were composed and
how they were first performed we shall see that such harmonical
succession of sounds was natural and even necessary in their
construction They were composed by the minstrels of those days to be
played on the harp accompanied by the voice The harp was strung with
wire which gives a sound of long continuance and had no contrivance
like that in the modern harpsichord by which the sound of the preceding
could be stoppt the moment a succeeding note began To avoid actual
discord it was therefore necessary that the succeeding emphatic note
should be a chord with the preceding as their sounds must exist at the
same time Hence arose that beauty in those tunes that has so long
pleased and will please for ever though men scarce know why That they
were originally composed for the harp and of the most simple kind I
mean a harp without any half notes but those in the natural scale and
with no more than two octaves of strings from C to C I conjecture from
another circumstance which is that not one of those tunes really
ancient has a single artificial half note in it and that in tunes
where it was most convenient for the voice to use the middle notes of
the harp and place the key in F there the B which if used should be a
B flat is always omitted by passing over it with a third The
connoisseurs in modern music will say I have no taste but I cannot
help adding that I believe our ancestors in hearing a good song
distinctly articulated sung to one of those tunes and accompanied by
the harp felt more real pleasure than is communicated by the generality
of modern operas exclusive of that arising from the scenery and
dancing Most tunes of late composition not having this natural harmony
united with their melody have recourse to the artificial harmony of a
bass and other accompanying parts This support in my opinion the old
tunes do not need and are rather confused than aided by it Whoever has
heard James Oswald play them on his violoncello will be less inclined
to dispute this with me I have more than once seen tears of pleasure in
the eyes of his auditors and yet I think even his playing those
tunes would please more if he gave them less modern ornament My son
when we parted desired me to present his Affectionate respects to you
Lady Kames and your amiable children be so good with those to accept
mine and believe me with sincerest esteem my dear Lord c

LETTER CONCERNING THE GRATITUDE OF AMERICA

AND THE PROBABILITY AND EFFECTS OF A UNION WITH GREAT BRITAIN AND
CONCERNING THE REPEAL OR SUSPENSION OF THE STAMP ACT

                                       London January  

SIR

I have attentively perused the paper you sent me and am of opinion
that the measure it proposes of an union with the colonies is a wise
one but I doubt it will hardly be thought so here till it is too late
to attempt it The time has been when the colonies would have esteemed
it a great advantage as well as honour to be permitted to send members
to Parliament and would have asked for that privilege if they could
have had the least hopes of obtaining it The time is now come when
they are indifferent about it and will probably not ask it though they
might accept it if offered them and the time will come when they will
certainly refuse it But if such an union were now established which
methinks it highly imports this country to establish it would probably
subsist as long as Britain shall continue a nation This people
however is too proud and too much despises the Americans to bear the
thought of admitting them to such an equitable participation in the
government of the whole

Then the next best thing seems to be leaving them in the quiet
enjoyment of their respective constitutions and when money is wanted
for any public service in which they ought to bear a part calling upon
them by requisitorial letters from the crown according to the
longestablished custom to grant such aids as their loyalty shall
dictate and their abilities permit The very sensible and benevolent
author of that paper seems not to have known that such a constitutional
custom subsists and has always hitherto been practised in America or
he would not have expressed himself in this manner It is evident
beyond a doubt to the intelligent and impartial that after the very
extraordinary efforts which were effectually made by Great Britain in
the late war to save the colonists from destruction and attended of
necessity with an enormous load of debts in consequence that the same
colonists now firmly secured from foreign enemies should be somehow
induced to contribute some proportion towards the exigencies of state in
future This looks as if he conceived the war had been carried on at
the sole expense of Great Britain and the colonies only reaped the
benefit without hitherto sharing the burden and were therefore now
indebted to Britain on that account And this is the same kind of
argument that is used by those who would fix on the colonies the heavy
charge of unreasonableness and ingratitude which I think your friend
did not intend

Please to acquaint him then that the fact is not so that every year
during the war requisitions were made by the crown on the colonies for
raising money and men that accordingly they made more extraordinary
efforts in proportion to their abilities than Britain did that they
raised paid and clothed for five or six years near twentyfive
thousand men besides providing for other services as building forts
equipping guardships paying transports c And that this was more than
their fair proportion is not merely an opinion of mine but was the
judgment of government here in full knowledge of all the facts for the
then ministry to make the burthen more equal recommended the case to
Parliament and obtained a reimbursement to the Americans of about two
hundred thousand pounds sterling every year which amounted only to
about two fifths of their expense and great part of the rest lies still
a load of debt upon them heavy taxes on all their estates real and
personal being laid by acts of their assemblies to discharge it and
yet will not discharge it in many years

While then these burdens continue while Britain restrains the
colonies in every branch of commerce and manufactures that she thinks
interferes with her own while she drains the colonies by her trade
with them of all the cash they can procure by every art and industry in
any part of the world and thus keeps them always in her debt for they
can make no law to discourage the importation of your to them ruinous
superfluities as you do the superfluities of France since such a law
would immediately be reported against by your Board of Trade and
repealed by the crown I say while these circumstances continue and
while there subsists the established method of royal requisitions for
raising money on them by their own assemblies on every proper occasion
can it be necessary or prudent to distress and vex them by taxes laid
here in a Parliament wherein they have no representative and in a
manner which they look upon to be unconstitutional and subversive of
their most valuable rights And are they to be thought unreasonable and
ungrateful if they oppose such taxes

Wherewith they say shall we show our loyalty to our gracious King if
our money is to be given by others without asking our consent And if
the Parliament has a right thus to take from us a penny in the pound
where is the line drawn that bounds that right and what shall hinder
their calling whenever they please for the other nineteen shillings
and eleven pence Have we then any thing that we can call our own It is
more than probable that bringing representatives from the colonies to
sit and act here as members of Parliament thus uniting and
consolidating your dominions would in a little time remove these
objections and difficulties and make the future government of the
colonies easy but till some such thing is done I apprehend no taxes
laid there by Parliament here will ever be collected but such as must
be stained with blood and I am sure the profit of such taxes will never
answer the expense of collecting them and that the respect and
affection of the Americans to this country will in the struggle be
totally lost perhaps never to be recovered and therewith all the
commercial and political advantages that might have attended the
continuance of this respect and this affection

In my own private judgment I think an immediate repeal of the Stamp Act
would be the best measure for this country but a suspension of it for
three years the best for that The repeal would fill them with joy and
gratitude restablish their respect and veneration for Parliament
restore at once their ancient and natural love for this country and
their regard for every thing that comes from it hence the trade would
be renewed in all its branches they would again indulge in all the
expensive superfluities you supply them with and their own newassumed
home industry would languish But the suspension though it might
continue their fears and anxieties would at the same time keep up their
resolutions of industry and frugality which in two or three years would
grow into habits to their lasting advantage However as the repeal
will probably not be now agreed to from what I think a mistaken
opinion that the honour and dignity of government is better supported
by persisting in a wrong measure once entered into than by rectifying
an error as soon as it is discovered we must allow the next best thing
for the advantage of both countries is the suspension for as to
executing the act by force it is madness and will be ruin to the
whole

The rest of your friends reasonings and propositions appear to me truly
just and judicious I will therefore only add that I am as desirous of
his acquaintance and intimacy as he was of my opinion

I am with much esteem

                                  Your obliged friend
                                                     B FRANKLIN



TO LORD KAMES

                                          London April  

MY DEAR LORD

I received your obliging favour of January the th You have kindly
relieved me from the pain I had long been under You are goodness
itself I ought to have answered yours of December   I never
received a letter that contained sentiments more suitable to my own It
found me under much agitation of mind on the very important subject it
treated It fortified me greatly in the judgment I was inclined to form
though contrary to the general vogue on the then delicate and critical
situation of affairs between Great Britain and her Colonies and on that
weighty point their Union You guessed aright in supposing that I
would not be a mute in that play I was extremely busy attending
Members of both Houses informing explaining consulting disputing in
a continual hurry from morning to night till the affair was happily
ended During the course of it being called before the House of
Commons I spoke my mind pretty freely Inclosed I send you the
imperfect account that was taken of that examination You will there see
how entirely we agree except in a point of fact of which you could not
but be misinformed the papers at that time being full of mistaken
assertions that the colonies had been the cause of the war and had
ungratefully refused to bear any part of the expence of it

I send it you now because I apprehend some late incidents are likely to
revive the contest between the two countries I fear it will be a
mischievous one It becomes a matter of great importance that clear
ideas should be formed on solid principles both in Britain and America
of the true political relation between them and the mutual duties
belonging to that relation Till this is done they will be often
jarring I know none whose knowledge sagacity and impartiality qualify
him so thoroughly for such a service as yours do you I wish therefore
you would consider it You may thereby be the happy instrument of great
good to the nation and of preventing much mischief and bloodshed I am
fully persuaded with you that a Consolidating Union by a fair and
equal representation of all the parts of this empire in Parliament is
the only firm basis on which its political grandeur and prosperity can
be founded Ireland once wished it but now rejects it The time has
been when the colonies might have been pleased with it they are now
indifferent about it and if it is much longer delayed they too will
refuse it But the pride of this people cannot bear the thought of it
and therefore it will be delayed Every man in England seems to consider
himself as a piece of a sovereign over America seems to jostle himself
into the throne with the King and talks of our subjects in the
Colonies The Parliament cannot well and wisely make laws suited to the
Colonies without being properly and truly informed of their
circumstances abilities temper c This it cannot be without
representatives from thence and yet it is fond of this power and
averse to the only means of acquiring the necessary knowledge for
exercising it which is desiring to be omnipotent without being
omniscient

I have mentioned that the contest is likely to be revived It is on this
occasion In the same session with the stamp act an act was passed to
regulate the quartering of soldiers in America when the bill was first
brought in it contained a clause empowering the officers to quarter
their soldiers in private houses this we warmly opposed and got it
omitted The bill passed however with a clause that empty houses
barns c should be hired for them and that the respective provinces
where they were should pay the expence and furnish firing bedding
drink and some other articles to the soldiers gratis There is no way
for any province to do this but by the Assemblys making a law to
raise the money The Pennsylvanian Assembly has made such a law the New
York Assembly has refused to do it and now all the talk here is of
sending a force to compel them

The reasons given by the Assembly to the Governor for the refusal are
that they understand the act to mean the furnishing such things to
soldiers only while on their march through the country and not to
great bodies of soldiers to be fixt as at present in the province the
burthen in the latter case being greater than the inhabitants can bear
That it would put it in the power of the CaptainGeneral to oppress the
province at pleasure c But there is supposed to be another reason at
bottom which they intimate though they do not plainly express it to
wit that it is of the nature of an internal tax laid on them by
Parliament which has no right so to do Their refusal is here called
Rebellion and punishment is thought of

Now waving that point of right and supposing the Legislatures in
America subordinate to the Legislature of Great Britain one might
conceive I think a power in the superior Legislature to forbid the
inferior Legislatures making particular laws but to enjoin it to make a
particular law contrary to its own judgment seems improper an Assembly
or Parliament not being an executive officer of Government whose duty
it is in lawmaking to obey orders but a deliberative body who are
to consider what comes before them its propriety practicability or
possibility and to determine accordingly The very nature of a
Parliament seems to be destroyed by supposing it may be bound and
compelled by a law of a superior Parliament to make a law contrary to
its own judgment

Indeed the act of Parliament in question has not as in other acts
when a duty is enjoined directed a penalty on neglect or refusal and a
mode of recovering that penalty It seems therefore to the people in
America as a mere requisition which they are at liberty to comply with
or not as it may suit or not suit the different circumstances of
different provinces Pennsylvania has therefore voluntarily complied
New York as I said before has refused The Ministry that made the act
and all their adherents call for vengeance The present Ministry are
perplext and the measures they will finally take on the occasion are
yet unknown But sure I am that if Force is used great mischief
will ensue the affections of the people of America to this country will
be alienated your commerce will be diminished and a total separation
of interests be the final consequence

It is a common but mistaken notion here that the Colonies were planted
at the expence of Parliament and that therefore the Parliament has a
right to tax them c The truth is they were planted at the expence of
private adventurers who went over there to settle with leave of the
King given by charter On receiving this leave and those charters the
adventurers voluntarily engaged to remain the Kings subjects though in
a foreign country a country which had not been conquered by either King
or Parliament but was possessed by a free people

When our planters arrived they purchased the lands of the natives
without putting King or Parliament to any expence Parliament had no
hand in their settlement was never so much as consulted about their
constitution and took no kind of notice of them till many years after
they were established I except only the two modern Colonies or rather
attempts to make Colonies for they succeed but poorly and as yet
hardly deserve the name of Colonies I mean Georgia and Nova Scotia
which have hitherto been little better than Parliamentary jobs Thus all
the colonies acknowledge the King as their sovereign his Governors
there represent his person Laws are made by their Assemblies or little
Parliaments with the Governors assent subject still to the Kings
pleasure to confirm or annul them Suits arising in the Colonies and
differences between Colony and Colony are determined by the King in
Council In this view they seem so many separate little states subject
to the same Prince The sovereignty of the King is therefore easily
understood But nothing is more common here than to talk of the
sovereignty of PARLIAMENT and the sovereignty of THIS NATION over
the Colonies a kind of sovereignty the idea of which is not so clear
nor does it clearly appear on what foundation it is established On the
other hand it seems necessary for the common good of the empire that
a power be lodged somewhere to regulate its general commerce this can
be placed nowhere so properly as in the Parliament of Great Britain and
therefore though that power has in some instances been executed with
great partiality to Britain and prejudice to the Colonies they have
nevertheless always submitted to it Customhouses are established in
all of them by virtue of laws made here and the duties constantly
paid except by a few smugglers such as are here and in all countries
but internal taxes laid on them by Parliament are still and ever will
be objected to for the reasons that you will see in the mentioned
Examination

Upon the whole I have lived so great a part of my life in Britain and
have formed so many friendships in it that I love it and sincerely
wish it prosperity and therefore wish to see that Union on which alone
I think it can be secured and established As to America the advantages
of such a union to her are not so apparent She may suffer at present
under the arbitrary power of this country she may suffer for a while in
a separation from it but these are temporary evils that she will
outgrow Scotland and Ireland are differently circumstanced Confined by
the sea they can scarcely increase in numbers wealth and strength so
as to overbalance England But America an immense territory favoured
by Nature with all advantages of climate soil great navigable rivers
and lakes c must become a great country populous and mighty and
will in a less time than is generally conceived be able to shake off
any shackles that may be imposed on her and perhaps place them on the
imposers In the mean time every act of oppression will sour their
tempers lessen greatly if not annihilate the profits of your commerce
with them and hasten their final revolt for the seeds of liberty are
universally found there and nothing can eradicate them And yet there
remains among that people so much respect veneration and affection for
Britain that if cultivated prudently with kind usage and tenderness
for their privileges they might be easily governed still for ages
without force or any considerable expence But I do not see here a
sufficient quantity of the wisdom that is necessary to produce such a
conduct and I lament the want of it

I borrowed at Millars the new edition of your Principles of Equity
and have read with great pleasure the preliminary discourse on the
Principles of Morality I have never before met with any thing so
satisfactory on the subject While reading it I made a few remarks as I
went along They are not of much importance but I send you the paper

I know the lady you mention having when in England before met her
once or twice at Lord Baths I remember I then entertained the same
opinion of her that you express On the strength of your kind
recommendation I purpose soon to wait on her

This is unexpectedly grown a long letter The visit to Scotland and the
Art of Virtue we will talk of hereafter It is now time to say that
I am with increasing esteem and affection my dear friend yours
ever

TO MISS MARY STEVENSON

                                           Paris Sept  

DEAR POLLY

I am always pleasd with a Letter from you and I flatter myself you may
be sometimes pleasd in receiving one from me tho it should be of
little Importance such as this which is to consist of a few occasional
Remarks made here and in my Journey hither

Soon after I left you in that agreable Society at Bromley I took the
Resolution of making a Trip with Sir John Pringle into France We
set out the th past All the way to Dover we were furnished with
PostChaises hung so as to lean forward the Top coming down over ones
Eyes like a Hood as if to prevent ones seeing the Country which
being one of my great Pleasures I was engagd in perpetual Disputes
with the Innkeepers Hostlers and Postilions about getting the Straps
taken up a Hole or two before and let down as much behind they
insisting that the Chaise leaning forward was an Ease to the Horses and
that the contrary would kill them I suppose the chaise leaning forward
looks to them like a Willingness to go forward and that its hanging
back shows a Reluctance They added other Reasons that were no Reasons
at all and made me as upon a  other Occasions almost wish that
Mankind had never been endowd with a reasoning Faculty since they know
so little how to make use of it and so often mislead themselves by it
and that they had been furnishd with a good sensible Instinct instead
of it

At Dover the next Morning we embarkd for Calais with a Number of
Passengers who had never been before at sea They would previously make
a hearty Breakfast because if the Wind should fail we might not get
over till Supper time Doubtless they thought that when they had paid
for their Breakfast they had a Right to it and that when they had
swallowed it they were sure of it But they had scarce been out half an
Hour before the Sea laid Claim to it and they were obligd to deliver
it up So it seems there are Uncertainties even beyond those between
the Cup and the Lip If ever you go to Sea take my Advice and live
sparingly a Day or two beforehand The Sickness if any will be lighter
and sooner over We got to Calais that Evening

Various Impositions we sufferd from Boatmen Porters c on both Sides
the Water I know not which are most rapacious the English or French
but the latter have with their Knavery the most Politeness

The Roads we found equally good with ours in England in some Places
pavd with smooth Stone like our new Streets for many Miles together
and Rows of Trees on each Side and yet there are no Turnpikes But then
the poor Peasants complaind to us grievously that they were obligd to
work upon the Roads full two Months in the Year without being paid for
their Labour Whether this is Truth or whether like Englishmen they
grumble Cause or no Cause I have not yet been able fully to inform
myself

The Women we saw at Calais on the Road at Bouloigne and in the Inns
and Villages were generally of dark Complexions but arriving at
Abbeville we found a sudden Change a Multitude of both Women and Men in
that Place appearing remarkably fair Whether this is owing to a small
Colony of Spinners Woolcombers and Weavers brought hither from
Holland with the Woollen Manufacture about  Years ago or to their
being less exposd to the Sun than in other Places their Business
keeping them much within Doors I know not Perhaps as in some other
Cases different Causes may club in producing the Effect but the Effect
itself is certain Never was I in a Place of greater Industry Wheels
and Looms going in every House

As soon as we left Abbeville the Swarthiness returnd I speak
generally for here are some fair Women at Paris who I think are not
whitend by Art As to Rouge they dont pretend to imitate Nature in
laying it on There is no gradual Diminution of the Colour from the
full Bloom in the Middle of the Cheek to the faint Tint near the Sides
nor does it show itself differently in different Faces I have not had
the Honour of being at any Ladys Toylette to see how it is laid on but
I fancy I can tell you how it is or may be done Cut a Hole of  Inches
Diameter in a Piece of Paper place it on the Side of your Face in such
a Manner as that the Top of the Hole may be just under your Eye then
with a Brush dipt in the Colour paint Face and Paper together so when
the Paper is taken off there will remain a round Patch of Red exactly
the Form of the Hole This is the Mode from the Actresses on the Stage
upwards thro all Ranks of Ladies to the Princesses of the Blood but it
stops there the Queen not using it having in the Serenity
Complacence and Benignity that shine so eminently in or rather through
her Countenance sufficient Beauty tho now an old Woman to do
extreamly well without it

You see I speak of the Queen as if I had seen her and so I have for
you must know I have been at Court We went to Versailles last Sunday
and had the Honour of being presented to the King he spoke to both of
us very graciously and chearfully is a handsome Man has a very lively
Look and appears younger than he is In the Evening we were at the
Grand Couvert where the Family sup in Publick The Form of their
Sitting at the Table was this The table was as you see half a Hollow
Square the Service Gold When either made a Sign for Drink the Word
was given by one of the Waiters A boire pour le Roy or A boire
pour la Reine Then two persons within the Square approachd one with
Wine the other with Water in Caraffes each drank a little Glass of
what he brought and then put both the Caraffes with a Glass on a
Salver and presented it Their Distance from each other was such as
that other Chairs might have been placd between any two of them An
Officer of the Court brought us up thro the Crowd of Spectators and
placd Sir John so as to stand between the King and Madame Adelaide and
me between the Queen and Madame Victoire The King talkd a good deal to
Sir John asking many Questions about our Royal Family and did me too
the Honour of taking some Notice of me thats saying enough for I
would not have you think me so much pleasd with this King and Queen as
to have a Whit less regard than I usd to have for ours No Frenchman
shall go beyond me in thinking my own King and Queen the very best in
the World and the most amiable

                 THE QUEEN      THE KING

Versailles has had infinite Sums laid out in building it and supplying
it with Water Some say the Expences exceeded  Millions Sterling The
Range of Building is immense the GardenFront most magnificent all of
hewn Stone the Number of Statues Figures Urns c in Marble and
Bronze of exquisite Workmanship is beyond Conception But the
Waterworks are out of Repair and so is great Part of the Front next the
Town looking with its shabby halfBrick Walls and broken Windows not
much better than the Houses in Durham Yard There is in short both at
Versailles and Paris a prodigious Mixture of Magnificence and
Negligence with every kind of Elegance except that of Cleanliness and
what we call Tidyness Tho I must do Paris the Justice to say that
in two Points of Cleanliness they exceed us The Water they drink tho
from the River they render as pure as that of the best Spring by
filtring it thro Cisterns filld with Sand and the Streets by constant
Sweeping are fit to walk in tho there is no pavd footPath
Accordingly many welldressd People are constantly seen walking in
them The Crowds of Coaches and Chairs for this Reason is not so great
Men as well as Women carry Umbrellas in their Hands which they extend
in case of Rain or two sic much sun and a Man with an Umbrella not
taking up more than  foot square or  square feet of the Street when
if in a Coach he would take up  square feet you can easily conceive
that tho the Streets here are narrower they may be much less
encumberd They are extreamly well pavd and the Stones being
generally Cubes when worn on one Side may be turnd and become new

The Civilities we everywhere receive give us the strongest Impressions
of the French Politeness It seems to be a Point settled here
universally that Strangers are to be treated with Respect and one has
just the same Deference shewn one here by being a Stranger as in
England by being a Lady The Customhouse Officers at Port St Denis as
we enterd Paris were about to seize  doz of excellent Bordeaux Wine
given us at Boulogne and which we brought with us but as soon as they
found we were Strangers it was immediately remitted on that Account At
the Church of Notre Dame where we went to see a magnificent
Illumination with Figures c for the deceasd Dauphiness we found
an immense Crowd who were kept out by Guards but the Officer being
told that we were Strangers from England he immediately admitted us
accompanied and showd us every thing Why dont we practise this
Urbanity to Frenchmen Why should they be allowed to outdo us in any
thing

Here is an Exhibition of Paintings like ours in London to which
Multitudes flock daily I am not Connoisseur enough to judge which has
most Merit Every Night Sundays not excepted here are Plays or Operas
and tho the Weather has been hot and the Houses full one is not
incommoded by the Heat so much as with us in Winter They must have some
Way of changing the Air that we are not acquainted with I shall
enquire into it

Travelling is one Way of lengthening Life at least in Appearance It is
but about a Fortnight since we left London but the Variety of Scenes we
have gone through makes it seem equal to Six Months living in one Place
Perhaps I have suffered a greater Change too in my own Person than I
could have done in Six Years at home I had not been here Six Days
before my Taylor and Perruquier had transformd me into a Frenchman
Only think what a Figure I make in a little BagWig and naked Ears They
told me I was become  Years younger and lookd very galante

So being in Paris where the Mode is to be sacredly followd I was once
very near making Love to my Friends Wife

This Letter shall cost you a Shilling and you may consider it cheap
when you reflect that it has cost me at least  Guineas to get into
the Situation that enables me to write it Besides I might if I had
staied at home have won perhaps two Shillings of you at Cribbidge By
the Way now I mention Cards let me tell you that Quadrille is quite
out of Fashion here and English Whisk all the Mode at Paris and the
Court

And pray look upon it as no small Matter that surrounded as I am by the
Glories of this World and Amusements of all Sorts I remember you and
Dolly and all the dear good Folks at Bromley Tis true I cant help
it but must and ever shall remember you all with Pleasure

Need I add that I am particularly my dear good Friend yours most
affectionately

ON THE LABOURING POOR

From the Gentlemans Magazine April 

SIR

I have met with much invective in the papers for these two years past
against the hardheartedness of the rich and much complaint of the
great oppressions suffered in this country by the labouring poor Will
you admit a word or two on the other side of the question I do not
propose to be an advocate for oppression or oppressors But when I see
that the poor are by such writings exasperated against the rich and
excited to insurrections by which much mischief is done and some
forfeit their lives I could wish the true state of things were better
understood the poor not made by these busy writers more uneasy and
unhappy than their situation subjects them to be and the nation not
brought into disrepute among foreigners by public groundless
accusations of ourselves as if the rich in England had no compassion
for the poor and Englishmen wanted common humanity

In justice then to this country give me leave to remark that the
condition of the poor here is by far the best in Europe for that
except in England and her American colonies there is not in any country
of the known world not even in Scotland or Ireland a provision by law
to enforce a support of the poor Everywhere else necessity reduces to
beggary This law was not made by the poor The legislators were men of
fortune By that act they voluntarily subjected their own estates and
the estates of all others to the payment of a tax for the maintenance
of the poor incumbering those estates with a kind of rentcharge for
that purpose whereby the poor are vested with an inheritance as it
were in all the estates of the rich I wish they were benefited by this
generous provision in any degree equal to the good intention with which
it was made and is continued But I fear the giving mankind a
dependance on any thing for support in age or sickness besides
industry and frugality during youth and health tends to flatter our
natural indolence to encourage idleness and prodigality and thereby to
promote and increase poverty the very evil it was intended to cure
thus multiplying beggars instead of diminishing them

Besides this tax which the rich in England have subjected themselves
to in behalf of the poor amounting in some places to five or six
shillings in the pound of the annual income they have by donations
and subscriptions erected numerous schools in various parts of the
kingdom for educating gratis the children of the poor in reading and
writing and in many of those schools the children are also fed and
cloathed They have erected hospitals at an immense expence for the
reception and cure of the sick the lame the wounded and the insane
poor for lyingin women and deserted children They are also
continually contributing towards making up losses occasioned by fire by
storms or by floods and to relieve the poor in severe seasons of
frost in times of scarcity c in which benevolent and charitable
contributions no nation exceeds us Surely there is some gratitude due
for so many instances of goodness

Add to this all the laws made to discourage foreign manufactures by
laying heavy duties on them or totally prohibiting them whereby the
rich are obliged to pay much higher prices for what they wear and
consume than if the trade was open These are so many laws for the
support of our labouring poor made by the rich and continued at their
expence all the difference of price between our own and foreign
commodities being so much given by our rich to our poor who would
indeed be enabled by it to get by degrees above poverty if they did
not as too generally they do consider every encrease of wages only as
something that enables them to drink more and work less so that their
distress in sickness age or times of scarcity continues to be the
same as if such laws had never been made in their favour

Much malignant censure have some writers bestowed upon the rich for
their luxury and expensive living while the poor are starving c
not considering that what the rich expend the labouring poor receive in
payment for their labour It may seem a paradox if I should assert that
our labouring poor do in every year receive the whole revenue of the
nation I mean not only the public revenue but also the revenue or
clear income of all private estates or a sum equivalent to the whole

In support of this position I reason thus The rich do not work for one
another Their habitations furniture cloathing carriages food
ornaments and every thing in short that they or their families use and
consume is the work or produce of the labouring poor who are and must
be continually paid for their labour in producing the same In these
payments the revenues of private estates are expended for most people
live up to their incomes In cloathing or provision for troops in arms
ammunition ships tents carriages c c every particular the
produce of labour much of the public revenue is expended The pay of
officers civil and military and of the private soldiers and sailors
requires the rest and they spend that also in paying for what is
produced by the labouring poor

I allow that some estates may increase by the owners spending less than
their income but then I conceive that other estates do at the same time
diminish by the owners spending more than their income so that when the
enriched want to buy more land they easily find lands in the hands of
the impoverished whose necessities oblige them to sell and thus this
difference is equalled I allow also that part of the expence of the
rich is in foreign produce or manufactures for producing which the
labouring poor of other nations must be paid but then I say we must
first pay our own labouring poor for an equal quantity of our
manufactures or produce to exchange for those foreign productions or
we must pay for them in money which money not being the natural
produce of our country must first be purchased from abroad by sending
out its value in the produce or manufactures of this country for which
manufactures our labouring poor are to be paid And indeed if we did
not export more than we import we could have no money at all I allow
farther that there are middle men who make a profit and even get
estates by purchasing the labour of the poor and selling it at
advanced prices to the rich but then they cannot enjoy that profit or
the income of estates but by spending them in employing and paying our
labouring poor in some shape or other for the products of industry
Even beggars pensioners hospitals and all that are supported by
charity spend their incomes in the same manner So that finally as I
said at first our labouring poor receive annually the whole of the
clear revenues of the nation and from us they can have no more

If it be said that their wages are too low and that they ought to be
better paid for their labour I heartily wish any means could be fallen
upon to do it consistent with their interest and happiness but as the
cheapness of other things is owing to the plenty of those things so the
cheapness of labour is in most cases owing to the multitude of
labourers and to their underworking one another in order to obtain
employment How is this to be remedied A law might be made to raise
their wages but if our manufactures are too dear they will not vend
abroad and all that part of employment will fail unless by fighting
and conquering we compel other nations to buy our goods whether they
will or no which some have been mad enough at times to propose

Among ourselves unless we give our working people less employment how
can we for what they do pay them higher than we do Out of what fund
is the additional price of labour to be paid when all our present
incomes are as it were mortgaged to them Should they get higher
wages would that make them less poor if in consequence they worked
fewer days of the week proportionably I have said a law might be made
to raise their wages but I doubt much whether it could be executed to
any purpose unless another law now indeed almost obsolete could at
the same time be revived and enforced a law I mean that many have
often heard and repeated but few have ever duly considered SIX days
shalt thou labour This is as positive a part of the commandment as
that which says The SEVENTH day thou shalt rest But we remember
well to observe the indulgent part and never think of the other
Saint Monday is generally as duly kept by our working people as
Sunday the only difference is that instead of employing their time
cheaply at church they are wasting it expensively at the alehouse

                                      I am Sir c

TO DUPONT DE NEMOURS

                                           London July  

I received your obliging letter of the th May with the most
acceptable present of your Physiocratie which I have read with great
pleasure and received from it a great deal of instruction There is
such a freedom from local and national prejudices and partialities so
much benevolence to mankind in general so much goodness mixt with the
wisdom in the principles of your new philosophy that I am perfectly
charmed with them and wish I could have stayed in France for some time
to have studied in your school that I might by conversing with its
founders have made myself quite a master of that philosophy I had
before I went into your country seen some letters of yours to Dr
Templeman that gave me a high opinion of the doctrines you are engaged
in cultivating and of your personal talents and abilities which made me
greatly desirous of seeing you Since I had not that good fortune the
next best thing is the advantage you are so good to offer me of your
correspondence which I shall ever highly value and endeavour to
cultivate with all the diligence I am capable of

I am sorry to find that that wisdom which sees the welfare of the parts
in the prosperity of the whole seems yet not to be known in this
country We are so far from conceiving that what is best for mankind
or even for Europe in general may be best for us that we are even
studying to establish and extend a separate interest of Britain to the
prejudice of even Ireland and our colonies It is from your
philosophy only that the maxims of a contrary and more happy conduct are
to be drawn which I therefore sincerely wish may grow and increase till
it becomes the governing philosophy of the human species as it must be
that of superior beings in better worlds I will take the liberty of
sending you a little fragment that has some tincture of it which on
that account I hope may be acceptable

Be so good as to present my sincere respect to that venerable apostle
Dr Quesnay and to the illustrious Ami des Hommes of whose civilities
to me at Paris I retain a grateful remembrance and believe me to be
with real and very great esteem Sir

Your obliged and most obedient humble servant

TO JOHN ALLEYNE

                                 Craven Street August  

DEAR SIR

You made an Apology to me for not acquaintg me sooner with your
Marriage I ought now to make an Apology to you for delaying so long the
Answer to your Letter It was mislaid or hid among my Papers and much
Business put it out of my Mind or prevented my looking for it and
writing when I thought of it So this Account between us if you please
may stand balanced I assure you it gave me great Pleasure to hear you
were married and into a Family of Reputation This I learnt from the
Public Papers The Character you give me of your Bride as it includes
every Qualification that in the married State conduces to mutual
Happiness is an Addition to that Pleasure Had you consulted me as a
Friend on the Occasion Youth on both sides I should not have thought
any Objection Indeed from the matches that have fallen under my
Observation I am rather inclind to think that early ones stand the
best Chance for Happiness The Tempers and habits of young People are
not yet become so stiff and uncomplying as when more advanced in Life
they form more easily to each other and hence many Occasions of Disgust
are removed And if Youth has less of that Prudence that is necessary
to conduct a Family yet the Parents and elder Friends of young married
Persons are generally at hand to afford their Advice which amply
supplies that Defect and by early Marriage Youth is sooner formd to
regular and useful Life and possibly some of those Accidents Habits or
Connections that might have injured either the Constitution or the
Reputation or both are thereby happily prevented

Particular Circumstances of particular Persons may possibly sometimes
make it prudent to delay entering into that State but in general when
Nature has renderd our Bodies fit for it the Presumption is in
Natures Favour that she has not judgd amiss in making us desire it
Late Marriages are often attended too with this further Inconvenience
that there is not the same Chance the parents shall live to see their
offspring educated Late Children says the Spanish Proverb are
early Orphans A melancholy Reflection to those whose Case it may be
With us in America Marriages are generally in the Morning of Life our
Children are therefore educated and settled in the World by Noon and
thus our Business being done we have an Afternoon and Evening of
chearful Leisure to ourselves such as your Friend at present enjoys By
these early Marriages we are blest with more Children and from the Mode
among us founded in Nature of every Mother suckling and nursing her
own Child more of them are raised Thence the swift Progress of
Population among us unparalleld in Europe

In fine I am glad you are married and congratulate you most cordially
upon it You are now more in the way of becoming a useful Citizen and
you have escapd the unnatural State of Celibacy for Life the Fate of
many here who never intended it but who having too long postpond the
Change of their Condition find at length that tis too late to think
of it and so live all their Lives in a Situation that greatly lessens a
Mans Value An odd Volume of a Set of Books you know is not worth its
proportion of the Set and what think you of the Usefulness of an odd
Half of a Pair of Scissors It cannot well cut any thing It may
possibly serve to scrape a Trencher

Pray make my Compliments and best Wishes acceptable to your Spouse I am
old and heavy and grow a little indolent or I should ere this have
presented them in Person I shall make but small Use of the old Mans
Privilege that of giving Advice to younger Friends Treat your Wife
always with Respect it will procure Respect to you not from her only
but from all that observe it Never use a slighting Expression to her
even in jest for Slights in Jest after frequent bandyings are apt to
end in angry earnest Be studious in your Profession and you will be
learned Be industrious and frugal and you will be rich Be sober and
temperate and you will be healthy Be in general virtuous and you will
be happy At least you will by such Conduct stand the best Chance for
such Consequences I pray God to bless you both being ever your
affectionate Friend

TO THE PRINTER OF THE LONDON CHRONICLE

                                                 August  

QUERIES recommended to the Consideration of those Gentlemen who are
for vigorous measures with the Americans

 Have the Colonists refused to answer any reasonable requisitions
made to their Assemblies by the mother country

 If they have not refused to grant reasonable aids in the way which
they think consistent with liberty why must they be stripped of their
property without their own consent and in a way which they think
inconsistent with liberty

 What is it for a people to be enslaved and tributary if this be
not viz to be forced to give up their property at the arbitrary
pleasure of persons to whose authority they have not submitted
themselves nor chosen for the purpose of imposing taxes upon them
Wherein consisted the impropriety of King Charless demanding ship money
by his sole authority but in its being an exercise of power by the
King which the people had not given the King Have the people of
America as the people of Britain by sending representatives
consented to a power in the British parliament to tax them

 Has not the British parliament by repealing the stamp act
acknowledged that they judged it improper Is there any difference
between the stamp act and the act obliging the Americans to pay
whatever we please for articles which they cannot do without as
glass and paper Is there any difference as to justice between our
treatment of the colonists and the tyranny of the Carthaginians over
their conquered Sardinians when they obliged them to take all their
corn from them and at whatever price they pleased to set upon it

 If that be true what is commonly said viz That the mother country
gains two millions a year by the colonies would it not have been
wiser to have gone on quietly in the happy way we were in till our
gains by those rising and flourishing countries should amount to
three four or five millions a year than by these new fashioned
vigorous measures to kill the goose which lays the golden eggs Would it
not have been better policy instead of taxing our colonists to have
done whatever we could to enrich them and encourage them to take off
our articles of luxury on which we may put our own price and thus
draw them into paying us a voluntary tax than deluge them in blood
thin their countries impoverish and distress them interrupt their
commerce force them on bankruptcy by which our merchants must be
ruined or tempt them to emigrations or alliances with our enemies

 The late war could not have been carried on without America nor
without Scotland Have we treated America and Scotland in such a manner
as is likely in future wars to encourage their zeal for the common
cause Or is England alone to be the Drawcansir of the world and to
bully not only their enemies but her friends

 Are not the subjects of Britain concerned to check a ministry who
by this rage of heaping taxes on taxes are only drawing into their own
hands more and more wealth and power while they are hurting the
commercial interest of the empire in general at the same time that
amidst profound peace the national debt and burden on the public
continue undiminished

POSITIONS TO BE EXAMINED CONCERNING NATIONAL WEALTH

                                             Dated April  

 All food or subsistence for mankind arises from the earth or waters

 Necessaries of life that are not food and all other conveniences
have their values estimated by the proportion of food consumed while we
are employed in procuring them

 A small people with a large territory may subsist on the
productions of nature with no other labour than that of gathering the
vegetables and catching the animals

 A large people with a small territory finds these insufficient
and to subsist must labour the earth to make it produce greater
quantities of vegetable food suitable for the nourishment of men and
of the animals they intend to eat

 From this labour arises a great increase of vegetable and animal
food and of materials for clothing as flax wool silk c The
superfluity of these is wealth With this wealth we pay for the labour
employed in building our houses cities c which are therefore only
subsistence thus metamorphosed

 Manufactures are only another shape into which so much provisions
and subsistence are turned as were equal in value to the manufactures
produced This appears from hence that the manufacturer does not in
fact obtain from the employer for his labour more than a mere
subsistence including raiment fuel and shelter all which derive
their value from the provisions consumed in procuring them

 The produce of the earth thus converted into manufactures may be
more easily carried to distant markets than before such conversion

 Fair commerce is where equal values are exchanged for equal the
expense of transport included Thus if it costs A in England as much
labour and charge to raise a bushel of wheat as it costs B in France to
produce four gallons of wine then are four gallons of wine the fair
exchange for a bushel of wheat A and B meeting at half distance with
their commodities to make the exchange The advantage of this fair
commerce is that each party increases the number of his enjoyments
having instead of wheat alone or wine alone the use of both wheat and
wine

 Where the labour and expense of producing both commodities are known
to both parties bargains will generally be fair and equal Where they
are known to one party only bargains will often be unequal knowledge
taking its advantage of ignorance

 Thus he that carries one thousand bushels of wheat abroad to sell
may not probably obtain so great a profit thereon as if he had first
turned the wheat into manufactures by subsisting therewith the workmen
while producing those manufactures since there are many expediting and
facilitating methods of working not generally known and strangers to
the manufactures though they know pretty well the expense of raising
wheat are unacquainted with those short methods of working and thence
being apt to suppose more labour employed in the manufactures than there
really is are more easily imposed on in their value and induced to
allow more for them than they are honestly worth

 Thus the advantage of having manufactures in a country does not
consist as is commonly supposed in their highly advancing the value of
rough materials of which they are formed since though six pennyworth
of flax may be worth twenty shillings when worked into lace yet the
very cause of its being worth twenty shillings is that besides the
flax it has cost nineteen shillings and sixpence in subsistence to the
manufacturer But the advantage of manufactures is that under their
shape provisions may be more easily carried to a foreign market and by
their means our traders may more easily cheat strangers Few where it
is not made are judges of the value of lace The importer may demand
forty and perhaps get thirty shillings for that which cost him but
twenty

 Finally there seem to be but three ways for a nation to acquire
wealth The first is by war as the Romans did in plundering their
conquered neighbours This is robbery The second by commerce which
is generally cheating The third by agriculture the only honest
way wherein man receives a real increase of the seed thrown into the
ground in a kind of continual miracle wrought by the hand of God in
his favour as a reward for his innocent life and his virtuous industry

                                Saturday Evening Septr  

Just come home from a Venison Feast where I have drank more than a
Philosopher ought I find my dear Pollys chearful chatty Letter that
exhilerates me more than all the Wine

Your good Mother says there is no Occasion for any Intercession of mine
in your behalf She is sensible that she is more in fault than her
Daughter She received an affectionate tender Letter from you and she
has not answered it tho she intended to do it but her Head not her
Heart has been bad and unfitted her for Writing She owns that she is
not so good a Subject as you are and that she is more unwilling to pay
Tribute to Cesar and has less Objection to Smuggling but tis not she
says mere Selfishness or Avarice tis rather an honest Resentment at
the Waste of those Taxes in Pensions Salaries Perquisites Contracts
and other Emoluments for the Benefit of People she does not love and
who do not deserve such Advantages becauseI supposebecause they are
not of her Party

Present my Respects to your good Landlord and his Family I honour them
for their conscientious Aversion to illicit Trading There are those in
the World who would not wrong a Neighbour but make no Scruple of
cheating the King The Reverse however does not hold for whoever
scruples cheating the King will certainly not wrong his Neighbour

You ought not to wish yourself an Enthusiast They have indeed their
imaginary Satisfactions and Pleasures but these are often ballancd by
imaginary Pains and Mortifications You can continue to be a good Girl
and thereby lay a solid Foundation for expected future Happiness
without the Enthusiasm that may perhaps be necessary to some others As
those Beings who have a good sensible Instinct have no need of Reason
so those who have Reason to regulate their Actions have no Occasion
for Enthusiasm However there are certain Circumstances in Life
sometimes wherein tis perhaps best not to hearken to Reason For
instance possibly if the Truth were known I have Reason to be jealous
of this same insinuating handsome young Physician but as it
flatters more my Vanity and therefore gives me more Pleasure to
suppose you were in Spirits on acct of my safe Return I shall turn a
deaf Ear to Reason in this Case as I have done with Success in twenty
others But I am sure you will always give me Reason enough to continue

TO JOSEPH PRIESTLEY

                                          London Sept  

DEAR SIR

In the Affair of so much Importance to you wherein you ask my Advice I
cannot for want of sufficient Premises advise you what to determine
but if you please I will tell you how When those difficult Cases
occur they are difficult chiefly because while we have them under
Consideration all the Reasons pro and con are not present to the
Mind at the same time but sometimes one Set present themselves and at
other times another the first being out of Sight Hence the various
Purposes or Inclinations that alternately prevail and the Uncertainty
that perplexes us

To get over this my Way is to divide half a Sheet of Paper by a Line
into two Columns writing over the one Pro and over the other Con
Then during three or four Days Consideration I put down under the
different Heads short Hints of the different Motives that at different
Times occur to me for or against the Measure When I have thus got
them all together in one View I endeavour to estimate their respective
Weights and where I find two one on each side that seem equal I
strike them both out If I find a Reason pro equal to some two Reasons
con I strike out the three If I judge some two Reasons con equal
to some three Reasons pro I strike out the five and thus proceeding
I find at length where the Ballance lies and if after a Day or two of
farther Consideration nothing new that is of Importance occurs on
either side I come to a Determination accordingly And tho the Weight
of Reasons cannot be taken with the Precision of Algebraic Quantities
yet when each is thus considered separately and comparatively and the
whole lies before me I think I can judge better and am less liable to
make a rash Step and in fact I have found great Advantage from this
kind of Equation in what may be called Moral or Prudential Algebra

Wishing sincerely that you may determine for the best I am ever my
dear Friend yours most affectionately

TO MISS GEORGIANA SHIPLEY

                                      London September  

DEAR MISS

I lament with you most sincerely the unfortunate end of poor MUNGO Few
squirrels were better accomplished for he had had a good education had
travelled far and seen much of the world As he had the honour of
being for his virtues your favourite he should not go like common
skuggs without an elegy or an epitaph Let us give him one in the
monumental style and measure which being neither prose nor verse is
perhaps the properest for grief since to use common language would look
as if we were not affected and to make rhymes would seem trifling in
sorrow

                          EPITAPH

                      Alas poor MUNGO
              Happy wert thou hadst thou known
                      Thy own felicity
               Remote from the fierce bald eagle
                 Tyrant of thy native woods
       Thou hadst nought to fear from his piercing talons
                 Nor from the murdering gun
                 Of the thoughtless sportsman
                   Safe in thy wired castle
               GRIMALKIN never could annoy thee
          Daily wert thou fed with the choicest viands
           By the fair hand of an indulgent mistress
                    But discontented
              Thou wouldst have more freedom

             Too soon alas didst thou obtain it
                       And wandering
    Thou art fallen by the fangs of wanton cruel RANGER

                        Learn hence
             Ye who blindly seek more liberty
       Whether subjects sons squirrels or daughters
       That apparent restraint may be real protection
                  Yielding peace and plenty
                       With security

You see my dear Miss how much more decent and proper this broken style
is than if we were to say by way of epitaph

    Here SKUGG
    Lies snug
    As a bug
    In a rug

and yet perhaps there are people in the world of so little feeling as
to think that this would be a goodenough epitaph for poor Mungo

If you wish it I shall procure another to succeed him but perhaps you
will now choose some other amusement

Remember me affectionately to all the good family and believe me ever

                            Your affectionate friend
                                                     B FRANKLIN



TO PETER FRANKLIN

                                                   No date

DEAR BROTHER

I like your ballad and think it well adapted for your purpose of
discountenancing expensive foppery and encouraging industry and
frugality If you can get it generally sung in your country it may
probably have a good deal of the effect you hope and expect from it But
as you aimed at making it general I wonder you chose so uncommon a
measure in poetry that none of the tunes in common use will suit it
Had you fitted it to an old one well known it must have spread much
faster than I doubt it will do from the best new tune we can get
composd for it I think too that if you had given it to some country
girl in the heart of the Massachusetts who has never heard any other
than psalm tunes or Chevy Chace the Children in the Wood the
Spanish Lady and such old simple ditties but has naturally a good
ear she might more probably have made a pleasing popular tune for you
than any of our masters here and more proper for your purpose which
would best be answered if every word could as it is sung be understood
by all that hear it and if the emphasis you intend for particular words
could be given by the singer as well as by the reader much of the force
and impression of the song depending on those circumstances I will
however get it as well done for you as I can

Do not imagine that I mean to depreciate the skill of our composers of
music here they are admirable at pleasing practised ears and know
how to delight one another but in composing for songs the reigning
taste seems to be quite out of nature or rather the reverse of nature
and yet like a torrent hurries them all away with it one or two
perhaps only excepted

You in the spirit of some ancient legislators would influence the
manners of your country by the united powers of poetry and music By
what I can learn of their songs the music was simple conformed
itself to the usual pronunciation of words as to measure cadence or
emphasis c never disguised and confounded the language by making a
long syllable short or a short one long when sung their singing was
only a more pleasing because a melodious manner of speaking it was
capable of all the graces of prose oratory while it added the pleasure
of harmony A modern song on the contrary neglects all the proprieties
and beauties of common speech and in their place introduces its
defects and absurdities as so many graces I am afraid you will
hardly take my word for this and therefore I must endeavour to support
it by proof Here is the first song I lay my hand on It happens to be a
composition of one of our greatest masters the everfamous Handel It
is not one of his juvenile performances before his taste could be
improved and formed It appeared when his reputation was at the highest
is greatly admired by all his admirers and is really excellent in its
kind It is called The additional Favourite Song in Judas
Maccabeus Now I reckon among the defects and improprieties of common
speech the following viz

 Wrong placing the accent or emphasis by laying it on words of no
importance or on wrong syllables

 Drawling or extending the sound of words or syllables beyond their
natural length

 Stuttering or making many syllables of one

 Unintelligibleness the result of the three foregoing united

 Tautology and

 Screaming without cause

For the wrong placing of the accent or emphasis see it on the word
their instead of being on the word vain

Illustration with their   vain mysterious art

And on the word from and the wrong syllable like

Illustration Godlike wisdom from  above

For the drawling see the last syllable of the word wounded And in
the syllable wis and the word from and syllable bove

Illustration Nor can heal the wounded heart

Illustration Godlike wisdom from above

For the stuttering see the words neer relieve in

Illustration Magic charms can neer   relieve you

Here are four syllables made of one and eight of three but this is
moderate I have seen in another song that I cannot now find seventeen
syllables made of three and sixteen of one The latter I remember was
the word charms viz cha a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
arms Stammering with a witness

For the unintelligibleness give this whole song to any taught singer
and let her sing it to any company that have never heard it you shall
find they will not understand three words in ten It is therefore that
at the oratorios and operas one sees with books in their hands all those
who desire to understand what they hear sung by even our best
performers

For the Tautology you have with their vain mysterious art twice
repeated magic charms can neer relieve you three times Nor can
heal the wounded heart three times Godlike wisdom from above
twice and this alone can neer deceive you two or three times But
this is reasonable when compared with the Monster Polypheme the
Monster Polypheme a hundred times over and over in his admired Acis
and Galatea

As to the screaming perhaps I cannot find a fair instance in this
song but whoever has frequented our operas will remember many And yet
here methinks the words no and eer when sung to these notes have
a little of the air of screaming and would actually be screamed by
some singers

Illustration No magic charms can eer relieve you

I send you inclosed the song with its music at length Read the words
without the repetitions Observe how few they are and what a shower of
notes attend them You will then perhaps be inclined to think with me
that though the words might be the principal part of an ancient song
they are of small importance in a modern one they are in short only a
pretence for singing

                              I am as ever
                                 Your affectionate brother
                                                     B FRANKLIN

PS I might have mentioned inarticulation among the defects in common
speech that are assumed as beauties in modern singing But as that seems
more the fault of the singer than of the composer I omitted it in what
related merely to the composition The fine singer in the present mode
stifles all the hard consonants and polishes away all the rougher parts
of words that serve to distinguish them one from another so that you
hear nothing but an admirable pipe and understand no more of the song
than you would from its tune played on any other instrument If ever it
was the ambition of musicians to make instruments that should imitate
the human voice that ambition seems now reversed the voice aiming to
be like an instrument Thus wigs were first made to imitate a good
natural head of hair but when they became fashionable though in
unnatural forms we have seen natural hair dressed to look like wigs



ON THE PRICE OF CORN AND MANAGEMENT OF THE POOR

TO THE PUBLIC

I am one of that class of people that feeds you all and at present is
abused by you all in short I am a farmer

By your newspapers we are told that God had sent a very short harvest
to some other countries of Europe I thought this might be in favour of
Old England and that now we should get a good price for our grain
which would bring millions among us and make us flow in money that to
be sure is scarce enough

But the wisdom of government forbade the exportation

Well says I then we must be content with the market price at home

No say my lords the mob you shant have that Bring your corn to
market if you dare well sell it for you for less money or take it for
nothing

Being thus attacked by both ends of the constitution the head and
tail of government what am I to do

Must I keep my corn in the barn to feed and increase the breed of rats
Be it so they cannot be less thankful than those I have been used to
feed

Are we farmers the only people to be grudged the profits of our honest
labour And why One of the late scribblers against us gives a bill of
fare of the provisions at my daughters wedding and proclaims to all
the world that we had the insolence to eat beef and pudding Has he not
read the precept in the good Book Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of
the ox that treadeth out the corn or does he think us less worthy of
good living than our oxen

O but the manufacturers the manufacturers they are to be favoured
and they must have bread at a cheap rate

Hark ye Mr Oaf the farmers live spendidly you say And pray would
you have them hoard the money they get Their fine clothes and
furniture do they make them themselves or for one another and so keep
the money among them Or do they employ these your darling
manufacturers and so scatter it again all over the nation

The wool would produce me a better price if it were suffered to go to
foreign markets but that Messieurs the Public your laws will not
permit It must be kept all at home that our dear manufacturers may
have it the cheaper And then having yourselves thus lessened our
encouragement for raising sheep you curse us for the scarcity of
mutton

I have heard my grandfather say that the farmers submitted to the
prohibition on the exportation of wool being made to expect and
believe that when the manufacturer bought his wool cheaper they
should also have their cloth cheaper But the deuce a bit It has been
growing dearer and dearer from that day to this How so Why truly the
cloth is exported and that keeps up the price

Now if it be a good principle that the exportation of a commodity is
to be restrained that so our people at home may have it the cheaper
stick to that principle and go thoroughstitch with it Prohibit the
exportation of your cloth your leather and shoes your iron ware and
your manufactures of all sorts to make them all cheaper at home And
cheap enough they will be I will warrant you till people leave off
making them

Some folks seem to think they ought never to be easy till England
becomes another Lubberland where it is fancied that streets are paved
with pennyrolls the houses tiled with pancakes and chickens ready
roasted cry Come eat me

I say when you are sure you have got a good principle stick to it and
carry it through I hear it is said that though it was necessary and
right for the ministry to advise a prohibition of the exportation of
corn yet it was contrary to law and also that though it was
contrary to law for the mob to obstruct wagons yet it was necessary
and right Just the same thing to a tittle Now they tell me an act of
indemnity ought to pass in favour of the ministry to secure them from
the consequences of having acted illegally If so pass another in
favour of the mob Others say some of the mob ought to be hanged by
way of example If sobut I say no more than I have said before when
you are sure that you have a good principle go through with it

You say poor labourers cannot afford to buy bread at a high price
unless they had higher wages Possibly But how shall we farmers be able
to afford our labourers higher wages if you will not allow us to get
when we might have it a higher price for our corn

By all that I can learn we should at least have had a guinea a quarter
more if the exportation had been allowed And this money England would
have got from foreigners

But it seems we farmers must take so much less that the poor may have
it so much cheaper

This operates then as a tax for the maintenance of the poor A very
good thing you will say But I ask Why a partial tax why laid on us
farmers only If it be a good thing pray Messieurs the Public take
your share of it by indemnifying us a little out of your public
treasury In doing a good thing there is both honour and pleasure you
are welcome to your share of both

For my own part I am not so well satisfied of the goodness of this
thing I am for doing good to the poor but I differ in opinion about
the means I think the best way of doing good to the poor is not
making them easy in poverty but leading or driving them out of it
In my youth I travelled much and I observed in different countries
that the more public provisions were made for the poor the less they
provided for themselves and of course became poorer And on the
contrary the less was done for them the more they did for themselves
and became richer There is no country in the world where so many
provisions are established for them so many hospitals to receive them
when they are sick or lame founded and maintained by voluntary
charities so many almshouses for the aged of both sexes together with
a solemn general law made by the rich to subject their estates to a
heavy tax for the support of the poor Under all these obligations are
our poor modest humble and thankful And do they use their best
endeavours to maintain themselves and lighten our shoulders of this
burthen On the contrary I affirm that there is no country in the
world in which the poor are more idle dissolute drunken and insolent
The day you passed that act you took away from before their eyes the
greatest of all inducements to industry frugality and sobriety by
giving them a dependence on somewhat else than a careful accumulation
during youth and health for support in age or sickness

In short you offered a premium for the encouragement of idleness and
you should not now wonder that it has had its effect in the increase of
poverty Repeal that law and you will soon see a change in their
manners Saint Monday and Saint Tuesday will soon cease to be
holidays SIX days shalt thou labour though one of the old
commandments long treated as out of date will again be looked upon as a
respectable precept industry will increase and with it plenty among
the lower people their circumstances will mend and more will be done
for their happiness by inuring them to provide for themselves than
could be done by dividing all your estates among them

Excuse me Messieurs the Public if upon this interesting subject I
put you to the trouble of reading a little of my nonsense I am sure I
have lately read a great deal of yours and therefore from you at
least from those of you who are writers I deserve a little indulgence

                                          I am yours c
                                                          ARATOR



AN EDICT BY THE KING OF PRUSSIA

From the Gentlemans Magazine October 

                                        Dantzic Sept  

We have long wondered here at the supineness of the English nation
under the Prussian impositions upon its trade entering our port We did
not till lately know the claims ancient and modern that hang over
that nation and therefore could not suspect that it might submit to
those impositions from a sense of duty or from principles of equity The
following Edict just made publick may if serious throw some light
upon this matter

FREDERIC by the grace of God King of Prussia c c c to all
present and to come  tous prsens et  venir Health The peace
now enjoyed throughout our dominions having afforded us leisure to
apply ourselves to the regulation of commerce the improvement of our
finances and at the same time the easing our domestic subjects in their
taxes For these causes and other good considerations us thereunto
moving we hereby make known that after having deliberated these
affairs in our council present our dear brothers and other great
officers of the state members of the same we of our certain
knowledge full power and authority royal have made and issued this
present Edict viz

    Whereas it is well known to all the world that the first
    German settlements made in the Island of Britain were by
    colonies of people subject to our renowned ducal ancestors
    and drawn from their dominions under the conduct of Hengist
    Horsa Hella Uff Cerdicus Ida and others and that the
    said colonies have nourished under the protection of our
    august house for ages past have never been emancipated
    therefrom and yet have hitherto yielded little profit to the
    same And whereas we ourself have in the last war fought for
    and defended the said colonies against the power of France
    and thereby enabled them to make conquests from the said
    power in America for which we have not yet received adequate
    compensation And whereas it is just and expedient that a
    revenue should be raised from the said colonies in Britain
    towards our indemnification and that those who are
    descendants of our ancient subjects and thence still owe us
    due obedience should contribute to the replenishing of our
    royal coffers as they must have done had their ancestors
    remained in the territories now to us appertaining We do
    therefore hereby ordain and command that from and after
    the date of these presents there shall be levied and paid
    to our officers of the customs on all goods wares and
    merchandizes and on all grain and other produce of the
    earth exported from the said Island of Britain and on all
    goods of whatever kind imported into the same a duty of four
    and a half per cent ad valorem for the use of us and our
    successors And that the said duty may more effectually be
    collected we do hereby ordain that all ships or vessels
    bound from Great Britain to any other part of the world or
    from any other part of the world to Great Britain shall in
    their respective voyages touch at our port of Koningsberg
    there to be unladen searched and charged with the said
    duties

    And whereas there hath been from time to time discovered in
    the said island of Great Britain by our colonists there
    many mines or beds of ironstone and sundry subjects of our
    ancient dominion skilful in converting the said stone into
    metal have in time past transported themselves thither
    carrying with them and communicating that art and the
    inhabitants of the said island presuming that they had a
    natural right to make the best use they could of the natural
    productions of their country for their own benefit have not
    only built furnaces for smelting the said stone into iron
    but have erected platingforges slittingmills and
    steelfurnaces for the more convenient manufacturing of the
    same thereby endangering a diminution of the said
    manufacture in our ancient dominionwe do therefore hereby
    farther ordain that from and after the date hereof no mill
    or other engine for slitting or rolling of iron or any
    platingforge to work with a tilthammer or any furnace for
    making steel shall be erected or continued in the said
    island of Great Britain And the Lord Lieutenant of every
    county in the said island is hereby commanded on information
    of any such erection within his county to order and by force
    to cause the same to be abated and destroyed as he shall
    answer the neglect thereof to us at his peril But we are
    nevertheless graciously pleased to permit the inhabitants of
    the said island to transport their iron into Prussia there
    to be manufactured and to them returned they paying our
    Prussian subjects for the workmanship with all the costs of
    commission freight and risk coming and returning any
    thing herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding

    We do not however think fit to extend this our indulgence
    to the article of wool but meaning to encourage not only
    the manufacturing of woollen cloth but also the raising of
    wool in our ancient dominions and to prevent both as much
    as may be in our said island we do hereby absolutely forbid
    the transportation of wool from thence even to the mother
    country Prussia and that those islanders may be farther and
    more effectually restrained in making any advantage of their
    own wool in the way of manufacture we command that none
    shall be carried out of one county into another nor shall
    any worsted bay or woollen yarn cloth says bays
    kerseys serges frizes druggets clothserges shalloons
    or any other drapery stuffs or woollen manufactures
    whatsoever made up or mixed with wool in any of the said
    counties be carried into any other county or be waterborne
    even across the smallest river or creek on penalty of
    forfeiture of the same together with the boats carriages
    horses c that shall be employed in removing them
    Nevertheless our loving subjects there are hereby permitted
    if they think proper to use all their wool as manure for
    the improvement of their lands

    And whereas the art and mystery of making hats hath arrived
    at great perfection in Prussia and the making of hats by our
    remoter subjects ought to be as much as possible restrained
    And forasmuch as the islanders before mentioned being in
    possession of wool beaver and other furs have
    presumptuously conceived they had a right to make some
    advantage thereof by manufacturing the same into hats to
    the prejudice of our domestic manufacture We do therefore
    hereby strictly command and ordain that no hats or felts
    whatsoever dyed or undyed finished or unfinished shall be
    loaded or put into or upon any vessel cart carriage or
    horse to be transported or conveyed out of one county in the
    said island into another county or to any other place
    whatsoever by any person or persons whatsoever on pain of
    forfeiting the same with a penalty of five hundred pounds
    sterling for every offence Nor shall any hatmaker in any
    of the said counties employ more than two apprentices on
    penalty of five pounds sterling per month we intending
    hereby that such hatmakers being so restrained both in the
    production and sale of their commodity may find no advantage
    in continuing their business But lest the said islanders
    should suffer inconveniency by the want of hats we are
    farther graciously pleased to permit them to send their
    beaver furs to Prussia and we also permit hats made thereof
    to be exported from Prussia to Britain the people thus
    favoured to pay all costs and charges of manufacturing
    interest commission to our merchants insurance and freight
    going and returning as in the case of iron

    And lastly being willing farther to favour our said
    colonies in Britain we do hereby also ordain and command
    that all the thieves highway and street robbers
    housebreakers forgerers murderers sdtes and villains
    of every denomination who have forfeited their lives to the
    law in Prussia but whom we in our great clemency do not
    think fit here to hang shall be emptied out of our gaols
    into the said island of Great Britain for the better
    peopling of that country

    We flatter ourselves that these our royal regulations and
    commands will be thought just and reasonable by our
    muchfavoured colonists in England the said regulations
    being copied from their statutes of  and  William III c
      Geo II c   Geo II c   Geo I c 
    and from other equitable laws made by their parliaments or
    from instructions given by their Princes or from resolutions
    of both Houses entered into for the good government of their
    own colonies in Ireland and America

    And all persons in the said island are hereby cautioned not
    to oppose in any wise the execution of this our Edict or any
    part thereof such opposition being high treason of which
    all who are suspected shall be transported in fetters from
    Britain to Prussia there to be tried and executed according
    to the Prussian law

                                      Such is our pleasure

    Given at Potsdam this twentyfifth day of the month of
    August one thousand seven hundred and seventythree and in
    the thirtythird year of our reign

    By the King in his Council

                                      RECHTMAESSIG Sec

Some take this Edict to be merely one of the Kings Jeux dEsprit
others suppose it serious and that he means a quarrel with England but
all here think the assertion it concludes with that these regulations
are copied from acts of the English parliament respecting their
colonies a very injurious one it being impossible to believe that a
people distinguished for their love of liberty a nation so wise so
liberal in its sentiments so just and equitable towards its neighbours
should from mean and injudicious views of petty immediate profit treat
its own children in a manner so arbitrary and tyrannical



RULES BY WHICH A GREAT EMPIRE MAY BE REDUCED TO A SMALL ONE

Presented to a late Minister when he entered upon his Administration

From the Gentlemans Magazine Sept 

An ancient Sage boasted that tho he could not fiddle he knew how to
make a great city of a little one The science that I a modern
simpleton am about to communicate is the very reverse

I address myself to all ministers who have the management of extensive
dominions which from their very greatness are become troublesome to
govern because the multiplicity of their affairs leaves no time for
fiddling

I In the first place gentlemen you are to consider that a great
empire like a great cake is most easily diminished at the edges Turn
your attention therefore first to your remotest provinces that as
you get rid of them the next may follow in order

II That the possibility of this separation may always exist take
special care the provinces are never incorporated with the mother
country that they do not enjoy the same common rights the same
privileges in commerce and that they are governed by severer laws
all of your enacting without allowing them any share in the choice of
the legislators By carefully making and preserving such distinctions
you will to keep to my simile of the cake act like a wise
gingerbreadbaker who to facilitate a division cuts his dough half
through in those places where when baked he would have it broken to
pieces

III Those remote provinces have perhaps been acquired purchased or
conquered at the sole expence of the settlers or their ancestors
without the aid of the mother country If this should happen to increase
her strength by their growing numbers ready to join in her wars her
commerce by their growing demand for her manufactures or her naval
power by greater employment for her ships and seamen they may
probably suppose some merit in this and that it entitles them to some
favour you are therefore to forget it all or resent it as if they
had done you injury If they happen to be zealous whigs friends of
liberty nurtured in revolution principles remember all that to their
prejudice and resolve to punish it for such principles after a
revolution is thoroughly established are of no more use they are
even odious and abominable

IV However peaceably your colonies have submitted to your government
shewn their affection to your interests and patiently borne their
grievances you are to suppose them always inclined to revolt and
treat them accordingly Quarter troops among them who by their
insolence may provoke the rising of mobs and by their bullets and
bayonets suppress them By this means like the husband who uses his
wife ill from suspicion you may in time convert your suspicions
into realities

V Remote provinces must have Governors and Judges to represent the
Royal Person and execute everywhere the delegated parts of his office
and authority You ministers know that much of the strength of
government depends on the opinion of the people and much of that
opinion on the choice of rulers placed immediately over them If you
send them wise and good men for governors who study the interest of the
colonists and advance their prosperity they will think their King
wise and good and that he wishes the welfare of his subjects If you
send them learned and upright men for Judges they will think him a
lover of justice This may attach your provinces more to his government
You are therefore to be careful whom you recommend for those offices If
you can find prodigals who have ruined their fortunes broken gamesters
or stockjobbers these may do well as governors for they will
probably be rapacious and provoke the people by their extortions
Wrangling proctors and pettifogging lawyers too are not amiss for
they will be for ever disputing and quarrelling with their little
parliaments If withal they should be ignorant wrongheaded and
insolent so much the better Attornies clerks and Newgate solicitors
will do for Chief Justices especially if they hold their places
during your pleasure and all will contribute to impress those ideas
of your government that are proper for a people you would wish to
renounce it

VI To confirm these impressions and strike them deeper whenever the
injured come to the capital with complaints of maladministration
oppression or injustice punish such suitors with long delay enormous
expence and a final judgment in favour of the oppressor This will have
an admirable effect every way The trouble of future complaints will be
prevented and Governors and Judges will be encouraged to farther acts
of oppression and injustice and thence the people may become more
disaffected and at length desperate

VII When such Governors have crammed their coffers and made themselves
so odious to the people that they can no longer remain among them with
safety to their persons recall and reward them with pensions You may
make them baronets too if that respectable order should not think fit
to resent it All will contribute to encourage new governors in the same
practice and make the supreme government detestable

VIII If when you are engaged in war your colonies should vie in
liberal aids of men and money against the common enemy upon your simple
requisition and give far beyond their abilities reflect that a penny
taken from them by your power is more honourable to you than a pound
presented by their benevolence despise therefore their voluntary
grants and resolve to harass them with novel taxes They will probably
complain to your parliaments that they are taxed by a body in which
they have no representative and that this is contrary to common right
They will petition for redress Let the Parliaments flout their claims
reject their petitions refuse even to suffer the reading of them and
treat the petitioners with the utmost contempt Nothing can have a
better effect in producing the alienation proposed for though many can
forgive injuries none ever forgave contempt

IX In laying these taxes never regard the heavy burthens those remote
people already undergo in defending their own frontiers supporting
their own provincial governments making new roads building bridges
churches and other public edifices which in old countries have been
done to your hands by your ancestors but which occasion constant calls
and demands on the purses of a new people Forget the restraints you
lay on their trade for your own benefit and the advantage a
monopoly of this trade gives your exacting merchants Think nothing of
the wealth those merchants and your manufacturers acquire by the colony
commerce their encreased ability thereby to pay taxes at home their
accumulating in the price of their commodities most of those taxes
and so levying them from their consuming customers all this and the
employment and support of thousands of your poor by the colonists you
are intirely to forget But remember to make your arbitrary tax more
grievous to your provinces by public declarations importing that your
power of taxing them has no limits so that when you take from them
without their consent one shilling in the pound you have a clear right
to the other nineteen This will probably weaken every idea of security
in their property and convince them that under such a government they
have nothing they can call their own which can scarce fail of
producing the happiest consequences

X Possibly indeed some of them might still comfort themselves and
say Though we have no property we have yet something left that is
valuable we have constitutional liberty both of person and of
conscience This King these Lords and these Commons who it seems are
too remote from us to know us and feel for us cannot take from us our
Habeas Corpus right or our right of trial by a jury of our
neighbours they cannot deprive us of the exercise of our religion
alter our ecclesiastical constitution and compel us to be Papists if
they please or Mahometans To annihilate this comfort begin by laws
to perplex their commerce with infinite regulations impossible to be
remembered and observed ordain seizures of their property for every
failure take away the trial of such property by Jury and give it to
arbitrary Judges of your own appointing and of the lowest characters in
the country whose salaries and emoluments are to arise out of the
duties or condemnations and whose appointments are during pleasure
Then let there be a formal declaration of both Houses that opposition
to your edicts is treason and that any person suspected of treason in
the provinces may according to some obsolete law be seized and sent to
the metropolis of the empire for trial and pass an act that those
there charged with certain other offences shall be sent away in chains
from their friends and country to be tried in the same manner for
felony Then erect a new Court of Inquisition among them accompanied by
an armed force with instructions to transport all such suspected
persons to be ruined by the expence if they bring over evidences to
prove their innocence or be found guilty and hanged if they cannot
afford it And lest the people should think you cannot possibly go any
farther pass another solemn declaratory act that King Lords Commons
had hath and of right ought to have full power and authority to make
statutes of sufficient force and validity to bind the unrepresented
provinces IN ALL CASES WHATSOEVER This will include spiritual with
temporal and taken together must operate wonderfully to your purpose
by convincing them that they are at present under a power something
like that spoken of in the scriptures which can not only kill their
bodies but damn their souls to all eternity by compelling them if
it pleases to worship the Devil

XI To make your taxes more odious and more likely to procure
resistance send from the capital a board of officers to superintend the
collection composed of the most indiscreet illbred and
insolent you can find Let these have large salaries out of the
extorted revenue and live in open grating luxury upon the sweat and
blood of the industrious whom they are to worry continually with
groundless and expensive prosecutions before the abovementioned
arbitrary revenue Judges all at the cost of the party prosecuted
tho acquitted because the King is to pay no costs Let these men
by your order be exempted from all the common taxes and burthens of
the province though they and their property are protected by its laws
If any revenue officers are suspected of the least tenderness for the
people discard them If others are justly complained of protect and
reward them If any of the under officers behave so as to provoke the
people to drub them promote those to better offices this will
encourage others to procure for themselves such profitable drubbings by
multiplying and enlarging such provocations and all will work towards
the end you aim at

XII Another way to make your tax odious is to misapply the produce of
it If it was originally appropriated for the defence of the
provinces the better support of government and the administration of
justice where it may be necessary then apply none of it to that
defence but bestow it where it is not necessary in augmented
salaries or pensions to every governor who has distinguished himself by
his enmity to the people and by calumniating them to their sovereign
This will make them pay it more unwillingly and be more apt to quarrel
with those that collect it and those that imposed it who will quarrel
again with them and all shall contribute to your main purpose of
making them weary of your government

XIII If the people of any province have been accustomed to support
their own Governors and Judges to satisfaction you are to apprehend
that such Governors and Judges may be thereby influenced to treat the
people kindly and to do them justice This is another reason for
applying part of that revenue in larger salaries to such Governors and
Judges given as their commissions are during your pleasure only
forbidding them to take any salaries from their provinces that thus the
people may no longer hope any kindness from their Governors or in
Crown cases any justice from their Judges And as the money thus
misapplied in one province is extorted from all probably all will
resent the misapplication

XIV If the parliaments of your provinces should dare to claim rights
or complain of your administration order them to be harassed with
repeated dissolutions If the same men are continually returned by new
elections adjourn their meetings to some country village where they
cannot be accommodated and there keep them during pleasure for this
you know is your PREROGATIVE and an excellent one it is as you may
manage it to promote discontents among the people diminish their
respect and increase their disaffection

XV Convert the brave honest officers of your navy into pimping
tidewaiters and colony officers of the customs Let those who in
time of war fought gallantly in defence of the commerce of their
countrymen in peace be taught to prey upon it Let them learn to be
corrupted by great and real smugglers but to shew their diligence
scour with armed boats every bay harbour river creek cove or nook
throughout the coast of your colonies stop and detain every coaster
every woodboat every fisherman tumble their cargoes and even their
ballast inside out and upside down and if a pennorth of pins is found
unentered let the whole be seized and confiscated Thus shall the trade
of your colonists suffer more from their friends in time of peace than
it did from their enemies in war Then let these boats crews land upon
every farm in their way rob the orchards steal the pigs and the
poultry and insult the inhabitants If the injured and exasperated
farmers unable to procure other justice should attack the aggressors
drub them and burn their boats you are to call this high treason and
rebellion order fleets and armies into their country and threaten to
carry all the offenders three thousand miles to be hanged drawn and
quartered O this will work admirably

XVI If you are told of discontents in your colonies never believe
that they are general or that you have given occasion for them
therefore do not think of applying any remedy or of changing any
offensive measure Redress no grievance lest they should be encouraged
to demand the redress of some other grievance Grant no request that is
just and reasonable lest they should make another that is unreasonable
Take all your informations of the state of the colonies from your
Governors and officers in enmity with them Encourage and reward these
leasingmakers secrete their lying accusations lest they should be
confuted but act upon them as the clearest evidence and believe
nothing you hear from the friends of the people suppose all their
complaints to be invented and promoted by a few factious demagogues
whom if you could catch and hang all would be quiet Catch and hang a
few of them accordingly and the blood of the Martyrs shall work
miracles in favour of your purpose

XVII If you see rival nations rejoicing at the prospect of your
disunion with your provinces and endeavouring to promote it if they
translate publish and applaud all the complaints of your discontented
colonists at the same time privately stimulating you to severer
measures let not that alarm or offend you Why should it since you
all mean the same thing

XVIII If any colony should at their own charge erect a fortress to
secure their port against the fleets of a foreign enemy get your
Governor to betray that fortress into your hands Never think of paying
what it cost the country for that would look at least like some
regard for justice but turn it into a citadel to awe the inhabitants
and curb their commerce If they should have lodged in such fortress the
very arms they bought and used to aid you in your conquests seize them
all it will provoke like ingratitude added to robbery One
admirable effect of these operations will be to discourage every other
colony from erecting such defences and so your enemies may more easily
invade them to the great disgrace of your government and of course
the furtherance of your project

XIX Send armies into their country under pretence of protecting the
inhabitants but instead of garrisoning the forts on their frontiers
with those troops to prevent incursions demolish those forts and
order the troops into the heart of the country that the savages may be
encouraged to attack the frontiers and that the troops may be protected
by the inhabitants This will seem to proceed from your ill will or your
ignorance and contribute farther to produce and strengthen an opinion
among them that you are no longer fit to govern them

XX Lastly invest the General of your army in the provinces with great
and unconstitutional powers and free him from the controul of even your
own Civil Governors Let him have troops enow under his command with
all the fortresses in his possession and who knows but like some
provincial Generals in the Roman empire and encouraged by the universal
discontent you have produced he may take it into his head to set up for
himself If he should and you have carefully practised these few
excellent rules of mine take my word for it all the provinces will
immediately join him and you will that day if you have not done it
sooner get rid of the trouble of governing them and all the plagues
attending their commerce and connection from henceforth and for ever

TO WILLIAM FRANKLIN

                                         London October  

DEAR SON

I wrote to you the st of last month since which I have received yours
of July  from New York I know not what letters of mine Governor
Hutchinson could mean as advising the people to insist on their
independency But whatever they were I suppose he has sent copies of
them hither having heard some whisperings about them I shall however
be able at any time to justify every thing I have written the purport
being uniformly this that they should carefully avoid all tumults and
every violent measure and content themselves with verbally keeping up
their claims and holding forth their rights whenever occasion requires
secure that from the growing importance of America those claims will
ere long be attended to and acknowledged

From a long and thorough consideration of the subject I am indeed of
opinion that the parliament has no right to make any law whatever
binding on the colonies that the king and not the king lords and
commons collectively is their sovereign and that the king with their
respective parliaments is their only legislator I know your sentiments
differ from mine on these subjects You are a thorough government man
which I do not wonder at nor do I aim at converting you I only wish
you to act uprightly and steadily avoiding that duplicity which in
Hutchinson adds contempt to indignation If you can promote the
prosperity of your people and leave them happier than you found them
whatever your political principles are your memory will be honoured

I have written two pieces here lately for the Public Advertiser on
American affairs designed to expose the conduct of this country towards
the colonies in a short comprehensive and striking view and stated
therefore in outoftheway forms as most likely to take the general
attention The first was called Rules by which a Great Empire may be
reduced to a small one the second An Edict of the King of
Prussia I sent you one of the first but could not get enough of the
second to spare you one though my clerk went the next morning to the
printers and wherever they were sold They were all gone but two In
my own mind I preferred the first as a composition for the quantity and
variety of the matter contained and a kind of spirited ending of each
paragraph But I find that others here generally prefer the second

I am not suspected as the author except by one or two friends and have
heard the latter spoken of in the highest terms as the keenest and
severest piece that has appeared here for a long time Lord Mansfield I
hear said of it that it was very ABLE and very ARTFUL indeed
and would do mischief by giving here a bad impression of the measures of
government and in the colonies by encouraging them in their contumacy
It is reprinted in the Chronicle where you will see it but stripped
of all the capitaling and italicing that intimate the allusions and
mark the emphasis of written discourses to bring them as near as
possible to those spoken printing such a piece all in one even small
character seems to me like repeating one of Whitefields sermons in the
monotony of a schoolboy

What made it the more noticed here was that people in reading it were
as the phrase is taken in till they had got half through it and
imagined it a real edict to which mistake I suppose the King of
Prussias character must have contributed I was down at Lord Le
Despencers when the post brought that days papers Mr Whitehead was
there too Paul Whitehead the author of Manners who runs early
through all the papers and tells the company what he finds remarkable
He had them in another room and we were chatting in the breakfast
parlour when he came running in to us out of breath with the paper in
his hand Here says he heres news for ye Heres the King of
Prussia claiming a right to this kingdom All stared and I as much as
anybody and he went on to read it When he had read two or three
paragraphs a gentleman present said Damn his impudence I dare say
we shall hear by next post that he is upon his march with one hundred
thousand men to back this Whitehead who is very shrewd soon after
began to smoke it and looking in my face said Ill be hanged if this
is not some of your American jokes upon us The reading went on and
ended with abundance of laughing and a general verdict that it was a
fair hit and the piece was cut out of the paper and preserved in my
Lords collection

I do not wonder that Hutchinson should be dejected It must be an
uncomfortable thing to live among people who he is conscious universally
detest him Yet I fancy he will not have leave to come home both
because they know not well what to do with him and because they do not
very well like his conduct I am ever your affectionate father

PREFACE TO AN ABRIDGMENT OF THE BOOK OF COMMON PRAYER



The editor of the following abridgment of the Liturgy of the Church of
England thinks it but decent and respectful to all more particularly to
the reverend body of clergy who adorn the Protestant religion by their
good works preaching and example that he should humbly offer some
reason for such an undertaking He addresses himself to the serious and
discerning He professes himself to be a Protestant of the Church of
England and holds in the highest veneration the doctrines of Jesus
Christ He is a sincere lover of social worship deeply sensible of its
usefulness to society and he aims at doing some service to religion by
proposing such abbreviations and omissions in the forms of our Liturgy
retaining everything he thinks essential as might if adopted procure
a more general attendance For besides the differing sentiments of many
pious and welldisposed persons in some speculative points who in
general have a good opinion of our Church it has often been observed
and complained of that the Morning and Evening Service as practised in
England and elsewhere are so long and filled with so many repetitions
that the continued attention suitable to so serious a duty becomes
impracticable the mind wanders and the fervency of devotion is
slackened Also the propriety of saying the same prayer more than once
in the same service is doubted as the service is thereby lengthened
without apparent necessity our Lord having given us a short prayer as
an example and censured the heathen for thinking to be heard because of
much speaking

Moreover many pious and devout persons whose age or infirmities will
not suffer them to remain for hours in a cold church especially in the
winter season are obliged to forego the comfort and edification they
would receive by their attendance at divine service These by
shortening the time would be relieved and the younger sort who have
had some principles of religion instilled into them and who have been
educated in a belief of the necessity of adoring their Maker would
probably more frequently as well as cheerfully attend divine service
if they were not detained so long at any one time Also many well
disposed tradesmen shopkeepers artificers and others whose
habitations are not remote from churches could and would more
frequently at least find time to attend divine service on other than
Sundays if the prayers were reduced to a much narrower compass

Formerly there were three services performed at different times of the
day which three services are now usually joined in one This may suit
the convenience of the person who officiates but it is too often
inconvenient and tiresome to the congregation If this abridgment
therefore should ever meet with acceptance the welldisposed clergy
who are laudably desirous to encourage the frequency of divine
service may promote so great and good a purpose by repeating it three
times on a Sunday without so much fatigue to themselves as at present
Suppose at nine oclock at eleven and at one in the evening and by
preaching no more sermons than usual of a moderate length and thereby
accommodate a greater number of people with convenient hours

These were general reasons for wishing and proposing an abridgment In
attempting it we do not presume to dictate even to a single Christian
We are sensible there is a proper authority in the rulers of the Church
for ordering such matters and whenever the time shall come when it may
be thought not unreasonable to revise our Liturgy there is no doubt but
every suitable improvement will be made under the care and direction of
so much learning wisdom and piety in one body of men collected Such
a work as this must then be much better executed In the meantime this
humble performance may serve to show the practicability of shortening
the service near one half without the omission of what is essentially
necessary and we hope moreover that the book may be occasionally of
some use to families or private assemblies of Christians

To give now some account of particulars We have presumed upon this
plan of abridgment to omit the First Lesson which is taken from the Old
Testament and retain only the Second from the New Testament which we
apprehend is more suitable to teach the somuchtoberevered doctrine
of Christ and of more immediate importance to Christians although the
Old Testament is allowed by all to be an accurate and concise history
and as such may more properly be read at home

We do not conceive it necessary for Christians to make use of more than
one creed Therefore in this abridgment are omitted the Nicene Creed
and that of St Athanasius Of the Apostles Creed we have retained the
parts that are most intelligible and most essential And as the
Father Son and Holy Ghost are there confessedly and avowedly a
part of the belief it does not appear necessary after so solemn a
confession to repeat again in the Litany the Son and Holy Ghost
as that part of the service is otherwise very prolix

The Psalms being a collection of odes written by different persons it
hath happened that many of them are on the same subjects and repeat the
same sentimentssuch as those that complain of enemies and persecutors
call upon God for protection express a confidence therein and thank
him for it when afforded A very great part of the book consists of
repetitions of this kind which may therefore well bear abridgment
Other parts are merely historical repeating the mention of facts more
fully narrated in the preceding books and which relating to the
ancestors of the Jews were more interesting to them than to us Other
parts are local and allude to places of which we have no knowledge
and therefore do not affect us Others are personal relating to the
particular circumstances of David or Solomon as kings and can
therefore seldom be rehearsed with any propriety by private Christians
Others imprecate in the most bitter terms the vengeance of God on our
adversaries contrary to the spirit of Christianity which commands us
to love our enemies and to pray for those that hate us and despitefully
use us For these reasons it is to be wished that the same liberty were
by the governors of our Church allowed to the minister with regard to
the reading Psalms as is taken by the clerk with regard to those
that are to be sung in directing the parts that he may judge most
suitable to be read at the time from the present circumstances of the
congregation or the tenor of his sermon by saying Let us read
such and such parts of the Psalms named Until this is done our
abridgment it is hoped will be found to contain what may be most
generally proper to be joined in by an assembly of Christian people The
Psalms are still apportioned to the days of the month as heretofore
though the several parts for each day are generally a full third
shorter

We humbly suppose the same service contained in this abridgment might
properly serve for all the saints days fasts and feasts reading only
the Epistle and Gospel appropriated to each day of the month

The Communion is greatly abridged on account of its great length
nevertheless it is hoped and believed that all those parts are retained
which are material and necessary

Infant Baptism in Churches being performed during divine service would
greatly add to the length of that service if it were not abridged We
have ventured therefore to leave out the less material parts

The Catechism as a compendium of systematic theology which learned
divines have written folio volumes to explain and which therefore it
may be presumed they thought scarce intelligible without such
expositions is perhaps taken altogether not so well adapted to the
capacities of children as might be wished Only those plain answers
therefore which express our duty towards God and our duty towards our
neighbor are retained here The rest is recommended to their reading
and serious consideration when more years shall have ripened their
understanding

The Confirmation is here shortened

The Commination and all cursing of mankind is we think best omitted
in this abridgment

The form of solemnization of Matrimony is often abbreviated by the
officiating minister at his discretion We have selected what appears to
us the material parts and which we humbly hope will be deemed
sufficient

The long prayers in the service for the Visitation of the Sick seem not
so proper when the afflicted person is very weak and in distress

The Order for the Burial of the Dead is very solemn and moving
nevertheless to preserve the health and lives of the living it
appeared to us that this service ought particularly to be shortened For
numbers standing in the open air with their hats off often in
tempestuous weather during the celebration its great length is not
only inconvenient but may be dangerous to the attendants We hope
therefore that our abridgment of it will be approved by the rational
and prudent

The Thanksgiving of women after childbirth being when read part of the
service of the day we have also in some measure abridged that

Having thus stated very briefly our motives and reasons and our manner
of proceeding in the prosecution of this work we hope to be believed
when we declare the rectitude of our intentions We mean not to lessen
or prevent the practice of religion but to honour and promote it We
acknowledge the excellency of our present Liturgy and though we have
shortened it we have not presumed to alter a word in the remaining
text not even to substitute who for which in the Lords Prayer and
elsewhere although it would be more correct We respect the characters
of bishops and other dignitaries of our Church and with regard to the
inferior clergy we wish that they were more equally provided for than
by that odious and vexatious as well as unjust method of gathering
tithes in kind which creates animosities and litigations to the
interruption of the good harmony and respect which might otherwise
subsist between the rectors and their parishioners

And thus conscious of upright meaning we submit this abridgment to the
serious consideration of the prudent and dispassionate and not to
enthusiasts and bigots being convinced in our own breasts that this
shortened method or one of the same kind better executed would further
religion increase unanimity and occasion a more frequent attendance on
the worship of God



A PARABLE AGAINST PERSECUTION

 And it came to pass after these things that Abraham sat in the door
of his tent about the going down of the sun

 And behold a man bent with age coming from the way of the
wilderness leaning on a staff

 And Abraham arose and met him and said unto him Turn in I pray
thee and wash thy feet and tarry all night and thou shalt arise early
in the morning and go on thy way

 But the man said Nay for I will abide under this tree

 And Abraham pressed him greatly so he turned and they went into the
tent and Abraham baked unleavened bread and they did eat

 And when Abraham saw that the man blessed not God he said unto him
Wherefore dost thou not worship the most high God Creator of heaven and
earth

 And the man answered and said I do not worship thy God neither do I
call upon his name for I have made to myself a god which abideth
always in mine house and provideth me with all things

 And Abrahams zeal was kindled against the man and he arose and fell
upon him and drove him forth with blows into the wilderness

 And God called unto Abraham saying Abraham where is the stranger

 And Abraham answered and said Lord he would not worship thee
neither would he call upon thy name therefore have I driven him out
from before my face into the wilderness

 And God said Have I borne with him these hundred and ninety and
eight years and nourished him and cloathed him notwithstanding his
rebellion against me and couldst not thou who art thyself a sinner
bear with him one night

 And Abraham said Let not the anger of the Lord wax hot against his
servant lo I have sinned lo I have sinned forgive me I pray thee

 And Abraham arose and went forth into the wilderness and sought
diligently for the man and found him and returned with him to the
tent and when he had entreated him kindly he sent him away on the
morrow with gifts

 And God spake again unto Abraham saying For this thy sin shall thy
seed be afflicted four hundred years in a strange land

 But for thy repentance will I deliver them and they shall come
forth with power and with gladness of heart and with much substance



A PARABLE ON BROTHERLY LOVE

 In those days there was no worker of iron in all the land And the
merchants of Midian passed by with their camels bearing spices and
myrrh and balm and wares of iron

 And Reuben bought an axe of the Ishmaelite merchants which he prized
highly for there was none in his fathers house

 And Simeon said unto Reuben his brother Lend me I pray thee thine
axe But he refused and would not

 And Levi also said unto him My brother lend me I pray thee thine
axe and he refused him also

 Then came Judah unto Reuben and entreated him saying Lo thou
lovest me and I have always loved thee do not refuse me the use of
thine axe

 But Reuben turned from him and refused him likewise

 Now it came to pass that Reuben hewed timber on the bank of the
river and his axe fell therein and he could by no means find it

 But Simeon Levi and Judah had sent a messenger after the
Ishmaelites with money and had bought for themselves each an axe

 Then came Reuben unto Simeon and said Lo I have lost mine axe
and my work is unfinished lend me thine I pray thee

 And Simeon answered him saying Thou wouldest not lend me thine
axe therefore will I not lend thee mine

 Then went he unto Levi and said unto him My brother thou knowest
my loss and my necessity lend me I pray thee thine axe

 And Levi reproached him saying Thou wouldest not lend me thine
axe when I desired it but I will be better than thou and will lend
thee mine

 And Reuben was grieved at the rebuke of Levi and being ashamed
turned from him and took not the axe but sought his brother Judah

 And as he drew near Judah beheld his countenance as it were covered
with grief and shame and he prevented him saying My brother I know
thy loss but why should it trouble thee Lo have I not an axe that
will serve both thee and me Take it I pray thee and use it as thine
own

 And Reuben fell on his neck and kissed him with tears saying
Thy kindness is great but thy goodness in forgiving me is greater
Thou are indeed my brother and whilst I live will I surely love thee

 And Judah said Let us also love our other brethren behold are we
not all of one blood

 And Joseph saw these things and reported them to his father Jacob

 And Jacob said Reuben did wrong but he repented Simeon also did
wrong and Levi was not altogether blameless

 But the heart of Judah is princely Judah hath the soul of a king
His fathers children shall bow down before him and he shall rule over
his brethren

TO JOSEPH PRIESTLEY

                                      Philadelphia July  

DEAR FRIEND

The Congress met at a time when all minds were so exasperated by the
perfidy of General Gage and his attack on the country people that
propositions of attempting an accommodation were not much relished and
it has been with difficulty that we have carried another humble petition
to the crown to give Britain one more chance one opportunity more of
recovering the friendship of the colonies which however I think she
has not sense enough to embrace and so I conclude she has lost them for
ever

She has begun to burn our seaport towns secure I suppose that we
shall never be able to return the outrage in kind She may doubtless
destroy them all but if she wishes to recover our commerce are these
the probable means She must certainly be distracted for no tradesman
out of Bedlam ever thought of encreasing the number of his customers by
knocking them on the head or of enabling them to pay their debts by
burning their houses If she wishes to have us subjects and that we
should submit to her as our compound sovereign she is now giving us
such miserable specimens of her government that we shall ever detest
and avoid it as a complication of robbery murder famine fire and
pestilence

You will have heard before this reaches you of the treacherous conduct
of General Gage to the remaining people in Boston in detaining their
goods after stipulating to let them go out with their effects on
pretence that merchants goods were not effects the defeat of a great
body of his troops by the country people at Lexington some other small
advantages gained in skirmishes with their troops and the action at
Bunkers Hill in which they were twice repulsed and the third time
gained a dear victory Enough has happened one would think to convince
your ministers that the Americans will fight and that this is a harder
nut to crack than they imagined

We have not yet applied to any foreign power for assistance nor
offered our commerce for their friendship Perhaps we never may yet it
is natural to think of it if we are pressed We have now an army on our
establishment which still holds yours besieged My time was never more
fully employed In the morning at six I am at the Committee of Safety
appointed by the Assembly to put the province in a state of defence
which committee holds till near nine when I am at the Congress and
that sits till after four in the afternoon Both these bodies proceed
with the greatest unanimity and their meetings are well attended It
will scarce be credited in Britain that men can be as diligent with us
from zeal for the public good as with you for thousands per annum Such
is the difference between uncorrupted new states and corrupted old
ones

Great frugality and great industry are now become fashionable here
Gentlemen who used to entertain with two or three courses pride
themselves now in treating with simple beef and pudding By these means
and the stoppage of our consumptive trade with Britain we shall be
better able to pay our voluntary taxes for the support of our troops
Our savings in the article of trade amount to near five millions
sterling per annum

I shall communicate your letter to Mr Winthrop but the camp is at
Cambridge and he has as little leisure for philosophy as myself
Believe me ever with sincere esteem my dear friend yours most
affectionately

TO A FRIEND IN ENGLAND

                                      Philadelphia Oct  

DEAR SIR

I wish as ardently as you can do for peace and should rejoice
exceedingly in coperating with you to that end But every ship from
Britain brings some intelligence of new measures that tend more and more
to exasperate and it seems to me that until you have found by dear
experience the reducing us by force impracticable you will think of
nothing fair and reasonable

We have as yet resolved only on defensive measures If you would recall
your forces and stay at home we should meditate nothing to injure you
A little time so given for cooling on both sides would have excellent
effects But you will goad and provoke us You despise us too much and
you are insensible of the Italian adage that there is no little
enemy I am persuaded that the body of the British people are our
friends but they are changeable and by your lying Gazettes may soon be
made our enemies Our respect for them will proportionably diminish and
I see clearly we are on the high road to mutual Enmity hatred and
detestation A separation of course will be inevitable Tis a million
of pities so fair a plan as we have hitherto been engaged in for
increasing strength and empire with public felicity should be
destroyed by the mangling hands of a few blundering ministers It will
not be destroyed God will protect and prosper it you will only exclude
yourselves from any share in it We hear that more ships and troops are
coming out We know that you may do us a great deal of mischief and
are determined to bear it patiently as long as we can But if you
flatter yourselves with beating us into submission you know neither the
people nor the country The Congress are still sitting and will wait
the result of their last petition Yours c

TO LORD HOWE

                               Philadelphia July th 

MY LORD

I receivd safe the Letters your Lordship so kindly forwarded to me and
beg you to accept my thanks

The official dispatches to which you refer me contain nothing more
than what we had seen in the Act of Parliament viz Offers of Pardon
upon Submission which I was sorry to find as it must give your
Lordship Pain to be sent upon so fruitless a Business

Directing Pardons to be offered to the Colonies who are the very
Parties injured expresses indeed that Opinion of our Ignorance
Baseness and Insensibility which your uninformd and proud Nation has
long been pleased to entertain of us but it can have no other effect
than that of increasing our Resentments It is impossible we should
think of Submission to a Government that has with the most wanton
Barbarity and Cruelty burnt our defenceless Towns in the midst of
Winter excited the Savages to massacre our Peacefull Farmers and our
Slaves to murder their Masters and is even now bringing foreign
Mercenaries to deluge our Settlements with Blood These atrocious
Injuries have extinguished every remaining Spark of Affection for that
Parent Country we once held so dear but were it possible for us to
forget and forgive them it is not possible for you I mean the
British Nation to forgive the People you have so heavily injured You
can never confide again in those as Fellow Subjects and permit them to
enjoy equal Freedom to whom you know you have given such just Cause of
lasting Enmity And this must impel you were we again under your
Government to endeavour the breaking our Spirit by the severest
Tyranny and obstructing by every Means in your Power our growing
Strength and Prosperity

But your Lordship mentions the Kings paternal solicitude for promoting
the Establishment of lasting Peace and Union with the Colonies If by
Peace is here meant a Peace to be entered into between Britain and
America as distinct States now at War and his Majesty has given your
Lordship Powers to treat with us of such a Peace I may venture to say
though without Authority that I think a Treaty for that purpose not yet
quite impracticable before we enter into foreign Alliances But I am
persuaded you have no such Powers Your nation though by punishing
those American Governors who have fomented the Discord rebuilding our
burnt Towns and repairing as far as possible the mischiefs done us
might yet recover a great Share of our Regard and the greatest Part of
our growing Commerce with all the Advantage of that additional Strength
to be derived from a Friendship with us but I know too well her
abounding Pride and deficient Wisdom to believe she will ever take such
salutary Measures Her Fondness for Conquest as a warlike Nation her
lust of Dominion as an ambitious one and her wish for a gainful
Monopoly as a commercial One none of them legitimate Causes of War
will all join to hide from her Eyes every view of her true Interests
and continually goad her on in those ruinous distant Expeditions so
destructive both of Lives and Treasure that must prove as pernicious to
her in the End as the Crusades formerly were to most of the Nations in
Europe

I have not the Vanity my Lord to think of intimidating by thus
predicting the Effects of this War for I know it will in England have
the Fate of all my former Predictions not to be believed till the Event
shall verify it

Long did I endeavour with unfeigned and unwearied Zeal to preserve
from breaking that fine and noble China Vase the British Empire for I
knew that being once broken the separate Parts could not retain even
their Shares of the Strength and Value that existed in the Whole and
that a perfect Reunion of those Parts could scarce ever be hoped for
Your Lordship may possibly remember the tears of Joy that wet my Cheek
when at your good Sisters in London you once gave me Expectations
that a Reconciliation might soon take Place I had the Misfortune to
find those Expectations disappointed and to be treated as the Cause of
the Mischief I was laboring to prevent My Consolation under that
groundless and malevolent Treatment was that I retained the Friendship
of many wise and good Men in that country and among the rest some
Share in the Regard of Lord Howe

The wellfounded Esteem and permit me to say Affection which I shall
always have for your Lordship makes it Painful to me to see you engaged
in conducting a War the great Ground of which as expressed in your
Letter is the necessity of preventing the American trade from passing
into foreign Channels To me it seems that neither the Obtaining or
Retaining of any trade how valuable soever is an Object for which men
may justly spill each others Blood that the true and sure Means of
extending and securing Commerce is the goodness and Cheapness of
Commodities and that the profit of no trade can ever be equal to the
Expence of compelling it and of holding it by Fleets and Armies

I consider this War against us therefore as both unjust and unwise
and I am persuaded that cool dispassionate Posterity will condemn to
Infamy those who advised it and that even Success will not save from
some Degree of Dishonor those who voluntarily engaged to Conduct it I
know your great motive in coming hither was the hope of being
Instrumental in a Reconciliation and I believe when you find that to
be impossible on any Terms given you to propose you will relinquish so
odious a Command and return to a more honourable private Station

With the greatest and most sincere Respect I have the Honour to be my
Lord your Lordships most obedient humble Servant

                                                     B FRANKLIN



THE SALE OF THE HESSIANS

FROM THE COUNT DE SCHAUMBERGH TO THE BARON HOHENDORF COMMANDING THE
HESSIAN TROOPS IN AMERICA

                                         Rome February  

MONSIEUR LE BARON

On my return from Naples I received at Rome your letter of the th
December of last year I have learned with unspeakable pleasure the
courage our troops exhibited at Trenton and you cannot imagine my joy
on being told that of the  Hessians engaged in the fight but 
escaped There were just  men killed and I cannot sufficiently
commend your prudence in sending an exact list of the dead to my
minister in London This precaution was the more necessary as the
report sent to the English ministry does not give but  dead This
would make  florins instead of  which I am entitled to
demand under our convention You will comprehend the prejudice which
such an error would work in my finances and I do not doubt you will
take the necessary pains to prove that Lord Norths list is false and
yours correct

The court of London objects that there were a hundred wounded who ought
not to be included in the list nor paid for as dead but I trust you
will not overlook my instructions to you on quitting Cassel and that
you will not have tried by human succor to recall the life of the
unfortunates whose days could not be lengthened but by the loss of a leg
or an arm That would be making them a pernicious present and I am sure
they would rather die than live in a condition no longer fit for my
service I do not mean by this that you should assassinate them we
should be humane my dear Baron but you may insinuate to the surgeons
with entire propriety that a crippled man is a reproach to their
profession and that there is no wiser course than to let every one of
them die when he ceases to be fit to fight

I am about to send to you some new recruits Dont economize them
Remember glory before all things Glory is true wealth There is nothing
degrades the soldier like the love of money He must care only for
honour and reputation but this reputation must be acquired in the midst
of dangers A battle gained without costing the conqueror any blood is
an inglorious success while the conquered cover themselves with glory
by perishing with their arms in their hands Do you remember that of the
 Lacedmonians who defended the defile of Thermopylae not one
returned How happy should I be could I say the same of my brave
Hessians

It is true that their king Leonidas perished with them but things
have changed and it is no longer the custom for princes of the empire
to go and fight in America for a cause with which they have no concern
And besides to whom should they pay the thirty guineas per man if I did
not stay in Europe to receive them Then it is necessary also that I be
ready to send recruits to replace the men you lose For this purpose I
must return to Hesse It is true grown men are becoming scarce there
but I will send you boys Besides the scarcer the commodity the higher
the price I am assured that the women and little girls have begun to
till our lands and they get on not badly You did right to send back to
Europe that Dr Crumerus who was so successful in curing dysentery
Dont bother with a man who is subject to looseness of the bowels That
disease makes bad soldiers One coward will do more mischief in an
engagement than ten brave men will do good Better that they burst in
their barracks than fly in a battle and tarnish the glory of our arms
Besides you know that they pay me as killed for all who die from
disease and I dont get a farthing for runaways My trip to Italy
which has cost me enormously makes it desirable that there should be a
great mortality among them You will therefore promise promotion to all
who expose themselves you will exhort them to seek glory in the midst
of dangers you will say to Major Maundorff that I am not at all content
with his saving the  men who escaped the massacre of Trenton Through
the whole campaign he has not had ten men killed in consequence of his
orders Finally let it be your principal object to prolong the war and
avoid a decisive engagement on either side for I have made arrangements
for a grand Italian opera and I do not wish to be obliged to give it
up Meantime I pray God my dear Baron de Hohendorf to have you in his
holy and gracious keeping



MODEL OF A LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION

                                            Paris April  

SIR

The bearer of this who is going to America presses me to give him a
Letter of Recommendation tho I know nothing of him not even his Name
This may seem extraordinary but I assure you it is not uncommon here
Sometimes indeed one unknown Person brings another equally unknown to
recommend him and sometimes they recommend one another As to this
Gentleman I must refer you to himself for his Character and Merits
with which he is certainly better acquainted than I can possibly be I
recommend him however to those Civilities which every Stranger of whom
one knows no Harm has a Right to and I request you will do him all the
good Offices and show him all the Favour that on further Acquaintance
you shall find him to deserve I have the Honour to be etc

TO 

      Passy Oct  

SIR

I am much obliged by your communication of the letter from England I am
of your opinion that it is not proper for publication here Our
friends expressions concerning Mr Wilson will be thought too angry to
be made use of by one philosopher when speaking of another and on a
philosophical question He seems as much heated about this one point
as the Jansenists and Molinists were about the five As to my writing
any thing on the subject which you seem to desire I think it not
necessary especially as I have nothing to add to what I have already
said upon it in a paper read to the committee who ordered the
conductors at Purfleet which paper is printed in the last French
edition of my writings

I have never entered into any controversy in defence of my philosophical
opinions I leave them to take their chance in the world If they are
right truth and experience will support them if wrong they ought
to be refuted and rejected Disputes are apt to sour ones temper and
disturb ones quiet I have no private interest in the reception of my
inventions by the world having never made nor proposed to make the
least profit by any of them The Kings changing his pointed
conductors for blunt ones is therefore a matter of small importance
to me If I had a wish about it it would be that he had rejected them
altogether as ineffectual For it is only since he thought himself and
family safe from the thunder of Heaven that he dared to use his own
thunder in destroying his innocent subjects I am Sir yours c

TO DAVID HARTLEY

                                            Passy Oct  

Dear Sir

I received duly your letter of May   including a copy of one you
had sent me the year before which never came to hand and which it
seems has been the case with some I wrote to you from America Filled
tho our letters have always been with sentiments of good will to both
countries and earnest desires of preventing their ruin and promoting
their mutual felicity I have been apprehensive that if it were known
that a correspondence subsisted between us it might be attended with
inconvenience to you I have therefore been backward in writing not
caring to trust the post and not well knowing whom else to trust with
my letters But being now assured of a safe conveyance I venture to
write to you especially as I think the subject such an one as you may
receive a letter upon without censure

Happy should I have been if the honest warnings I gave of the fatal
separation of interests as well as of affections that must attend the
measures commenced while I was in England had been attended to and the
horrid mischief of this abominable war been thereby prevented I should
still be happy in any successful endeavours for restoring peace
consistent with the liberties the safety and honour of America As to
our submitting to the government of Great Britain it is vain to think
of it She has given us by her numberless barbarities in the
prosecution of the war and in the treatment of prisoners by her malice
in bribing slaves to murder their masters and savages to massacre the
families of farmers with her baseness in rewarding the unfaithfulness
of servants and debauching the virtue of honest seamen intrusted with
our property so deep an impression of her depravity that we never
again can trust her in the management of our affairs and interests It
is now impossible to persuade our people as I long endeavoured that
the war was merely ministerial and that the nation bore still a good
will to us The infinite number of addresses printed in your gazettes
all approving this conduct of your government towards us and
encouraging our destruction by every possible means the great majority
in Parliament constantly manifesting the same sentiments and the
popular public rejoicings on occasion of any news of the slaughter of an
innocent and virtuous people fighting only in defence of their just
rights these together with the recommendations of the same measures
by even your celebrated moralists and divines in their writings and
sermons that are cited approved and applauded in your great national
assemblies all join in convincing us that you are no longer the
magnanimous and enlightened nation we once esteemed you and that you
are unfit and unworthy to govern us as not being able to govern your
own passions

But as I have said I should be nevertheless happy in seeing peace
restored For tho if my friends and the friends of liberty and virtue
who still remain in England could be drawn out of it a continuance of
this war to the ruin of the rest would give me less concern I cannot
as that removal is impossible but wish for peace for their sakes as
well as for the sake of humanity and preventing further carnage

This wish of mine ineffective as it may be induces me to mention to
you that between nations long exasperated against each other in war
some act of generosity and kindness towards prisoners on one side has
softened resentment and abated animosity on the other so as to bring
on an accommodation You in England if you wish for peace have at
present the opportunity of trying this means with regard to the
prisoners now in your goals sic They complain of very severe
treatment They are far from their friends and families and winter is
coming on in which they must suffer extremely if continued in their
present situation fed scantily on bad provisions without warm lodging
clothes or fire and not suffered to invite or receive visits from
their friends or even from the humane and charitable of their enemies

I can assure you from my own certain knowledge that your people
prisoners in America have been treated with great kindness they have
been served with the same rations of wholesome provisions with our own
troops comfortable lodgings have been provided for them and they have
been allowed large bounds of villages in a healthy air to walk and
amuse themselves with on their parole Where you have thought fit to
employ contractors to supply your people these contractors have been
protected and aided in their operations Some considerable act of
kindness towards our people would take off the reproach of inhumanity in
that respect from the nation and leave it where it ought with more
certainty to lay on the conductors of your war in America This I hint
to you out of some remaining good will to a nation I once sincerely
loved But as things are and in my present temper of mind not being
over fond of receiving obligations I shall content myself with
proposing that your government would allow us to send or employ a
commissary to take some care of those unfortunate people Perhaps on
your representations this might speedily be obtained in England though
it was refused most inhumanly at New York

If you could have leisure to visit the goals sic in which they are
confined and should be desirous of knowing the truth relative to the
treatment they receive I wish you would take the trouble of
distributing among the most necessitous according to their wants two or
three hundred pounds for which your drafts on me here shall be
punctually honourd You could then be able to speak with some certainty
to the point in Parliament and this might be attended with good effect

If you cannot obtain for us permission to send a commissary possibly
you may find a trusty humane discreet person at Plymouth and another
at Portsmouth who would undertake to communicate what relief we may be
able to afford those unhappy brave men martyrs to the cause of
liberty Your King will not reward you for taking this trouble but God
will I shall not mention the good will of America you have what is
better the applause of your own good conscience Our captains have set
at liberty above  of your people made prisoners by our armed vessels
and brought into France besides a great number dismissed at sea on your
coasts to whom vessels were given to carry them in But you have not
returned us a man in exchange If we had sold your people to the Moors
at Sallee as you have many of ours to the African and East India
Companies could you have complained

In revising what I have written I found too much warmth in it and was
about to strike out some parts Yet I let them go as they will afford
you this one reflection If a man naturally cool and renderd still
cooler by old age is so warmed by our treatment of his country how
much must those people in general be exasperated against us And why are
we making inveterate enemies by our barbarity not only of the present
inhabitants of a great country but of their infinitely more numerous
posterity who will in future ages detest the name of Englishman as
much as the children in Holland now do those of Alva and Spaniard
This will certainly happen unless your conduct is speedily changed and
the national resentment falls where it ought to fall heavily on your
ministry or perhaps rather on the King whose will they only execute

With the greatest esteem and affection and best wishes for your
prosperity I have the honour to be dear Sir c

A DIALOGUE BETWEEN BRITAIN FRANCE SPAIN HOLLAND SAXONY AND AMERICA


Britain Sister of Spain I have a Favour to ask of you My Subjects
in America are disobedient and I am about to chastize them I beg you
will not furnish them with any Arms or Ammunition

Spain Have you forgotten then that when my Subjects in the Low
Countries rebelled against me you not only furnishd them with military
Stores but joind them with an Army and a Fleet I wonder how you can
have the Impudence to ask such a Favour of me or the Folly to expect
it

Britain You my dear Sister of France will surely not refuse me this
Favour

France Did you not assist my Rebel Hugenots with a Fleet and an Army
at Rochelle And have you not lately aided privately and sneakingly my
Rebel Subjects in Corsica And do you not at this Instant keep their
Chief pensiond and ready to head a fresh Revolt there whenever you
can find or make an Opportunity Dear Sister you must be a little
silly

Britain Honest Holland You see it is remembered that I was once your
Friend you will therefore be mine on this Occasion I know indeed
you are accustomd to smuggle with these Rebels of mine I will wink at
that sell em as much Tea as you please to enervate the Rascals since
they will not take it of me but for Gods sake dont supply them with
any Arms

Holland Tis true you assisted me against Philip my Tyrant of Spain
but have I not assisted you against one of your TyrantsH and enabled
you to expell him Surely that Accompt as we Merchants say is
ballanced and I am nothing in your Debt I have indeed some
Complaints against you for endeavouring to starve me by your
Navigation Acts but being peaceably disposd I do not quarrel with
you for that I shall only go on quietly with my own Business Trade is
my Profession t is all I have to subsist on And let me tell you I
shall make no scruple on the prospect of a good Market for that
Commodity even to send my ships to Hell and supply the Devil with
Brimstone For you must know I can insure in London against the Burning
of my Sails

  H James d Franklins note

America to Britain Why you old bloodthirsty Bully You who have been
everywhere vaunting your own Prowess and defaming the Americans as
poltroons You who have boasted of being able to march over all their
Bellies with a single Regiment You who by Fraud have possessed yourself
of their strongest Fortress and all the arms they had stored up in it
You who have a disciplind Army in their Country intrenchd to the
Teeth and provided with every thing Do you run about begging all
Europe not to supply those poor People with a little Powder and Shot Do
you mean then to fall upon them naked and unarmd and butcher them in
cold Blood Is this your Courage Is this your Magnanimity

Britain Oh you wickedWhigPresbyterianSerpent Have you the
Impudence to appear before me after all your Disobedience Surrender
immediately all your Liberties and Properties into my Hands or I will
cut you to Pieces Was it for this that I planted your country at so
great an Expence That I protected you in your Infancy and defended you
against all your Enemies

America I shall not surrender my Liberty and Property but with my
Life It is not true that my Country was planted at your expence Your
own Records refute that Falshood to your Face Nor did you ever afford
me a Man or a Shilling to defend me against the Indians the only
Enemies I had upon my own Account But when you have quarrelld with
all Europe and drawn me with you into all your Broils then you value
yourself upon protecting me from the Enemies you have made for me I
have no natural Cause of Difference with Spain France or Holland and
yet by turns I have joind with you in Wars against them all You would
not suffer me to make or keep a separate Peace with any of them tho I
might easily have done it to great Advantage Does your protecting me in
those Wars give you a Right to fleece me If so as I fought for you as
well as you for me it gives me a proportionable Right to fleece you

TO CHARLES DE WEISSENSTEIN

                                             Passy July  

SIR

I received your letter dated at Brussels the th past My vanity might
possibly be nattered by your expressions of compliment to my
understanding if your proposals did not more clearly manifest a mean
opinion of it

You conjure me in the name of the omniscient and just God before whom
I must appear and by my hopes of future fame to consider if some
expedient cannot be found to put a stop to the desolation of America
and prevent the miseries of a general war As I am conscious of having
taken every step in my power to prevent the breach and no one to widen
it I can appear cheerfully before that God fearing nothing from his
justice in this particular though I have much occasion for his mercy in
many others As to my future fame I am content to rest it on my past
and present conduct without seeking an addition to it in the crooked
dark paths you propose to me where I should most certainly lose it
This your solemn address would therefore have been more properly made to
your sovereign and his venal Parliament He and they who wickedly
began and madly continue a war for the desolation of America are
alone accountable for the consequences

You endeavour to impress me with a bad opinion of French faith but the
instances of their friendly endeavours to serve a race of weak princes
who by their own imprudence defeated every attempt to promote their
interest weigh but little with me when I consider the steady
friendship of France to the Thirteen United States of Switzerland which
has now continued inviolate two hundred years You tell me that she
will certainly cheat us and that she despises us already I do not
believe that she will cheat us and I am not certain that she despises
us but I see clearly that you are endeavouring to cheat us by your
conciliatory bills that you actually despised our understandings when
you flattered yourselves those artifices would succeed and that not
only France but all Europe yourselves included most certainly and for
ever would despise us if we were weak enough to accept your insidious
propositions

Our expectations of the future grandeur of America are not so
magnificent and therefore not so vain or visionary as you represent
them to be The body of our people are not merchants but humble
husbandmen who delight in the cultivation of their lands which from
their fertility and the variety of our climates are capable of
furnishing all the necessaries and conveniences of life without external
commerce and we have too much land to have the least temptation to
extend our territory by conquest from peaceable neighbours as well as
too much justice to think of it Our militia you find by experience
are sufficient to defend our lands from invasion and the commerce with
us will be defended by all the nations who find an advantage in it We
therefore have not the occasion you imagine of fleets or standing
armies but may leave those expensive machines to be maintained for the
pomp of princes and the wealth of ancient states We propose if
possible to live in peace with all mankind and after you have been
convinced to your cost that there is nothing to be got by attacking
us we have reason to hope that no other power will judge it prudent to
quarrel with us lest they divert us from our own quiet industry and
turn us into corsairs preying upon theirs The weight therefore of an
independent empire which you seem certain of our inability to bear
will not be so great as you imagine The expense of our civil government
we have always borne and can easily bear because it is small A
virtuous and laborious people may be cheaply governed Determining as
we do to have no offices of profit nor any sinecures or useless
appointments so common in ancient or corrupted states we can govern
ourselves a year for the sum you pay in a single department or for
what one jobbing contractor by the favour of a minister can cheat you
out of in a single article

You think we flatter ourselves and are deceived into an opinion that
England must acknowledge our independency We on the other hand
think you flatter yourselves in imagining such an acknowledgment a vast
boon which we strongly desire and which you may gain some great
advantage by granting or withholding We have never asked it of you we
only tell you that you can have no treaty with us but as an independent
state and you may please yourselves and your children with the rattle
of your right to govern us as long as you have done with that of your
Kings being King of France without giving us the least concern if you
do not attempt to exercise it That this pretended right is
indisputable as you say we utterly deny Your Parliament never had a
right to govern us and your King has forfeited it by his bloody
tyranny But I thank you for letting me know a little of your mind
that even if the Parliament should acknowledge our independency the
act would not be binding to posterity and that your nation would resume
and prosecute the claim as soon as they found it convenient from the
influence of your passions and your present malice against us We
suspected before that you would not be actually bound by your
conciliatory acts longer than till they had served their purpose of
inducing us to disband our forces but we were not certain that you
were knaves by principle and that we ought not to have the least
confidence in your offers promises or treaties though confirmed by
Parliament

I now indeed recollect my being informed long since when in England
that a certain very great personage then young studied much a certain
book called Arcana Imperii I had the curiosity to procure the
book and read it There are sensible and good things in it but some bad
ones for if I remember rightly a particular king is applauded for his
politically exciting a rebellion among his subjects at a time when they
had not strength to support it that he might in subduing them take
away their privileges which were troublesome to him and a question is
formally stated and discussed Whether a prince who to appease a
revolt makes promises of indemnity to the revolters is obliged to
fulfil those promises Honest and good men would say Ay but this
politician says as you say No And he gives this pretty reason that
though it was right to make the promises because otherwise the revolt
would not be suppressed yet it would be wrong to keep them because
revolters ought to be punished to deter from future revolts

If these are the principles of your nation no confidence can be placed
in you it is in vain to treat with you and the wars can only end in
being reduced to an utter inability of continuing them

One main drift of your letter seems to be to impress me with an idea of
your own impartiality by just censures of your ministers and measures
and to draw from me propositions of peace or approbations of those you
have enclosed to me which you intimate may by your means be conveyed to
the King directly without the intervention of those ministers You
would have me give them to or drop them for a stranger whom I may
find next Monday in the church of Notre Dame to be known by a rose in
his hat You yourself Sir are quite unknown to me you have not
trusted me with your true name Our taking the least step towards a
treaty with England through you might if you are an enemy be made use
of to ruin us with our new and good friends I may be indiscreet enough
in many things but certainly if I were disposed to make propositions
which I cannot do having none committed to me to make I should never
think of delivering them to the Lord knows who to be carried to the
Lord knows where to serve no one knows what purposes Being at this
time one of the most remarkable figures in Paris even my appearance in
the church of Notre Dame where I cannot have any conceivable business
and especially being seen to leave or drop any letter to any person
there would be a matter of some speculation and might from the
suspicions it must naturally give have very mischievous consequences to
our credit here

The very proposing of a correspondence so to be managed in a manner not
necessary where fair dealing is intended gives just reason to suppose
you intend the contrary Besides as your court has sent Commissioners
to treat with the Congress with all the powers that could be given
them by the crown under the act of Parliament what good purpose can be
served by privately obtaining propositions from us Before those
Commissioners went we might have treated in virtue of our general
powers with the knowledge advice and approbation of our friends
upon any propositions made to us But under the present circumstances
for us to make propositions while a treaty is supposed to be actually
on foot with the Congress would be extremely improper highly
presumptuous with regard to our constituents and answer no good end
whatever

I write this letter to you notwithstanding which I think I can convey
in a less mysterious manner and guess it may come to your hands I
write it because I would let you know our sense of your procedure which
appears as insidious as that of your conciliatory bills Your true way
to obtain peace if your ministers desire it is to propose openly to
the Congress fair and equal terms and you may possibly come sooner to
such a resolution when you find that personal flatteries general
cajolings and panegyrics on our virtue and wisdom are not likely to
have the effect you seem to expect the persuading us to act basely and
foolishly in betraying our country and posterity into the hands of our
most bitter enemies giving up or selling our arms and warlike stores
dismissing our ships of war and troops and putting those enemies in
possession of our forts and ports

This proposition of delivering ourselves bound and gagged ready for
hanging without even a right to complain and without a friend to be
found afterwards among all mankind you would have us embrace upon the
faith of an act of Parliament Good God an act of your Parliament This
demonstrates that you do not yet know us and that you fancy we do not
know you but it is not merely this flimsy faith that we are to act
upon you offer us hope the hope of PLACES PENSIONS and PEERAGES
These judging from yourselves you think are motives irresistible This
offer to corrupt us Sir is with me your credential and convinces me
that you are not a private volunteer in your application It bears the
stamp of British court character It is even the signature of your
King But think for a moment in what light it must be viewed in America
By PLACES you mean places among us for you take care by a special
article to secure your own to yourselves We must then pay the salaries
in order to enrich ourselves with these places But you will give us
PENSIONS probably to be paid too out of your expected American revenue
and which none of us can accept without deserving and perhaps
obtaining a SUSpension PEERAGES alas Sir our long observation of
the vast servile majority of your peers voting constantly for every
measure proposed by a minister however weak or wicked leaves us small
respect for that title We consider it as a sort of tarandfeather
honour or a mixture of foulness and folly which every man among us
who should accept it from your King would be obliged to renounce or
exchange for that conferred by the mobs of their own country or wear it
with everlasting infamy I am Sir your humble Servant

THE EPHEMERA

An Emblem of Human Life



You may remember my dear friend that when we lately spent that happy
day in the delightful garden and sweet society of the Moulin Joly I
stopt a little in one of our walks and staid some time behind the
company We had been shown numberless skeletons of a kind of little fly
called an ephemera whose successive generations we were told were
bred and expired within the day I happened to see a living company of
them on a leaf who appeared to be engaged in conversation You know I
understand all the inferior animal tongues my too great application to
the study of them is the best excuse I can give for the little progress
I have made in your charming language I listened through curiosity to
the discourse of these little creatures but as they in their national
vivacity spoke three or four together I could make but little of
their conversation I found however by some broken expressions that I
heard now and then they were disputing warmly on the merit of two
foreign musicians one a cousin the other a moscheto in which
dispute they spent their time seemingly as regardless of the shortness
of life as if they had been sure of living a month Happy people
thought I you live certainly under a wise just and mild government
since you have no public grievances to complain of nor any subject of
contention but the perfections and imperfections of foreign music I
turned my head from them to an old greyheaded one who was single on
another leaf and talking to himself Being amused with his soliloquy I
put it down in writing in hopes it will likewise amuse her to whom I am
so much indebted for the most pleasing of all amusements her delicious
company and heavenly harmony

It was said he the opinion of learned philosophers of our race who
lived and flourished long before my time that this vast world the
Moulin Joly could not itself subsist more than eighteen hours and I
think there was some foundation for that opinion since by the apparent
motion of the great luminary that gives life to all nature and which in
my time has evidently declined considerably towards the ocean at the end
of our earth it must then finish its course be extinguished in the
waters that surround us and leave the world in cold and darkness
necessarily producing universal death and destruction I have lived
seven of those hours a great age being no less than four hundred and
twenty minutes of time How very few of us continue so long I have seen
generations born flourish and expire My present friends are the
children and grandchildren of the friends of my youth who are now
alas no more And I must soon follow them for by the course of
nature though still in health I cannot expect to live above seven or
eight minutes longer What now avails all my toil and labor in amassing
honeydew on this leaf which I cannot live to enjoy What the political
struggles I have been engaged in for the good of my compatriot
inhabitants of this bush or my philosophical studies for the benefit of
our race in general for in politics what can laws do without morals
Our present race of ephemer will in a course of minutes become corrupt
like those of other and older bushes and consequently as wretched And
in philosophy how small our progress Alas art is long and life is
short My friends would comfort me with the idea of a name they say I
shall leave behind me and they tell me I have lived long enough to
nature and to glory But what will fame be to an ephemera who no longer
exists And what will become of all history in the eighteenth hour when
the world itself even the whole Moulin Joly shall come to its end and
be buried in universal ruin

To me after all my eager pursuits no solid pleasures now remain but
the reflection of a long life spent in meaning well the sensible
conversation of a few good lady ephemer and now and then a kind smile
and a tune from the ever amiable Brillante

TO RICHARD BACHE

                                             Passy June  

I am very easy about the efforts Messrs Lee and Izard are using as
you tell me to injure me on that side of the water I trust in the
justice of the Congress that they will listen to no accusations against
me that I have not first been acquainted with and had an opportunity
of answering I know those gentlemen have plenty of ill will to me
though I have never done to either of them the smallest injury or given
the least just cause of offence But my too great reputation and the
general good will this people have for me and the respect they show me
and even the compliments they make me all grieve those unhappy
gentlemen unhappy indeed in their tempers and in the dark
uncomfortable passions of jealousy anger suspicion envy and malice
It is enough for good minds to be affected at other peoples
misfortunes but they that are vexed at everybodys good luck can
never be happy I take no other revenge of such enemies than to let
them remain in the miserable situation in which their malignant natures
have placed them by endeavouring to support an estimable character and
thus by continuing the reputation the world has hitherto indulged me
with I shall continue them in their present state of damnation and I
am not disposed to reverse my conduct for the alleviation of their
torments

I am surprised to hear that my grandson Temple Franklin being with
me should be an objection against me and that there is a cabal for
removing him Methinks it is rather some merit that I have rescued
a valuable young man from the danger of being a Tory and fixed him in
honest republican Whig principles as I think from the integrity of his
disposition his industry his early sagacity and uncommon abilities
for business he may in time become of great service to his country It
is enough that I have lost my son would they add my grandson An
old man of seventy I undertook a winter voyage at the command of the
Congress and for the public service with no other attendant to take
care of me I am continued here in a foreign country where if I am
sick his filial attention comforts me and if I die I have a child to
close my eyes and take care of my remains His dutiful behaviour towards
me and his diligence and fidelity in business are both pleasing and
useful to me His conduct as my private secretary has been
unexceptionable and I am confident the Congress will never think of
separating us

I have had a great deal of pleasure in Ben too He is a good honest
lad and will make I think a valuable man He had made as much
proficiency in his learning as the boarding school he was at could well
afford him and after some consideration where to find a better for
him I at length fixed on sending him to Geneva I had a good
opportunity by a gentleman of that city who had a place for him in his
chaise and has a son about the same age at the same school He promised
to take care of him and enclosed I send you the letters I have since
received relating to him and from him He went very cheerfully and I
understand is very happy I miss his company on Sundays at dinner But
if I live and I can find a little leisure I shall make the journey
next spring to see him and to see at the same time the old thirteen
United States of Switzerland

Thanks be to God I continue well and hearty Undoubtedly I grow older
but I think the last ten years have made no great difference I have
sometimes the gout but they say that is not so much a disease as a
remedy God bless you I am your affectionate father

MORALS OF CHESS



Playing at chess is the most ancient and most universal game known
among men for its original is beyond the memory of history and it has
for numberless ages been the amusement of all the civilised nations of
Asia the Persians the Indians and the Chinese Europe has had it
above a thousand years the Spaniards have spread it over their part of
America and it has lately begun to make its appearance in the United
States It is so interesting in itself as not to need the view of gain
to induce engaging in it and thence it is seldom played for money
Those therefore who have leisure for such diversions cannot find one
that is more innocent and the following piece written with a view to
correct among a few young friends some little improprieties in the
practice of it shows at the same time that it may in its effects on
the mind be not merely innocent but advantageous to the vanquished as
well as the victor

The Game of Chess is not merely an idle Amusement Several very valuable
qualities of the Mind useful in the course of human Life are to be
acquird or strengthened by it so as to become habits ready on all
occasions For Life is a kind of Chess in which we often have Points to
gain  Competitors or Adversaries to contend with and in which there
is a vast variety of good and ill Events that are in some degree the
Effects of Prudence or the want of it By playing at Chess then we may
learn

I Foresight which looks a little into futurity and considers the
Consequences that may attend an action for it is continually occurring
to the Player If I move this piece what will be the advantages or
disadvantages of my new situation What Use can my Adversary make of it
to annoy me What other moves can I make to support it and to defend
myself from his attacks

II Circumspection which surveys the whole Chessboard or scene of
action the relations of the several pieces and situations the Dangers
they are respectively exposed to the several possibilities of their
aiding each other the probabilities that the Adversary may make this or
that move and attack this or the other Piece and what different Means
can be used to avoid his stroke or turn its consequences against him

III Caution not to make our moves too hastily This habit is best
acquired by observing strictly the laws of the Game such as If you
touch a Piece you must move it somewhere if you set it down you must
let it stand And it is therefore best that these rules should be
observed as the Game becomes thereby more the image of human Life and
particularly of War in which if you have incautiously put yourself
into a bad and dangerous position you cannot obtain your Enemys Leave
to withdraw your Troops and place them more securely but you must
abide all the consequences of your rashness

And lastly we learn by Chess the habit of not being discouraged by
present appearances in the state of our affairs the habit of hoping for
a favourable Change and that of persevering in the search of resources
The Game is so full of Events there is such a variety of turns in it
the Fortune of it is so subject to sudden Vicissitudes and one so
frequently after long contemplation discovers the means of extricating
ones self from a supposed insurmountable Difficulty that one is
encouraged to continue the Contest to the last in hopes of Victory from
our own skill or at least of getting a stale mate from the Negligence
of our Adversary And whoever considers what in Chess he often sees
instances of that particular pieces of success is are apt to
produce Presumption  its consequent Inattention by which more is
afterwards lost than was gaind by the preceding Advantage while
misfortunes produce more care and attention by which the loss may be
recovered will learn not to be too much discouraged by any present
success of his Adversary nor to despair of final good fortune upon
every little Check he receives in the pursuit of it

That we may therefore be induced more frequently to chuse this
beneficial amusement in preference to others which are not attended
with the same advantages every Circumstance that may increase the
pleasure of it should be regarded and every action or word that is
unfair disrespectful or that in any way may give uneasiness should be
avoided as contrary to the immediate intention of both the Players
which is to pass the Time agreably

Therefore first if it is agreed to play according to the strict rules
then those rules are to be exactly observed by both parties and should
not be insisted on for one side while deviated from by the otherfor
this is not equitable

Secondly if it is agreed not to observe the rules exactly but one
party demands indulgencies he should then be as willing to allow them
to the other

Thirdly no false move should ever be made to extricate yourself out of
difficulty or to gain an advantage There can be no pleasure in playing
with a person once detected in such unfair practice

Fourthly if your adversary is long in playing you ought not to hurry
him or express any uneasiness at his delay You should not sing nor
whistle nor look at your watch nor take up a book to read nor make a
tapping with your feet on the floor or with your fingers on the table
nor do any thing that may disturb his attention For all these things
displease and they do not show your skill in playing but your
craftiness or your rudeness

Fifthly you ought not to endeavour to amuse and deceive your adversary
by pretending to have made bad moves and saying that you have now lost
the game in order to make him secure and careless and inattentive to
your schemes for this is fraud and deceit not skill in the game

Sixthly you must not when you have gained a victory use any
triumphing or insulting expression nor show too much pleasure but
endeavour to console your adversary and make him less dissatisfied with
himself by every kind of civil expression that may be used with truth
such as you understand the game better than I but you are a little
inattentive or you play too fast or you had the best of the
game but something happened to divert your thoughts and that turned it
in my favour

Seventhly if you are a spectator while others play observe the most
perfect silence For if you give advice you offend both parties him
against whom you give it because it may cause the loss of his game him
in whose favour you give it because though it be good and he follows
it he loses the pleasure he might have had if you had permitted him to
think until it had occurred to himself Even after a move or moves you
must not by replacing the pieces show how they might have been placed
better for that displeases and may occasion disputes and doubts about
their true situation All talking to the players lessens or diverts
their attention and is therefore unpleasing Nor should you give the
least hint to either party by any kind of noise or motion If you do
you are unworthy to be a spectator If you have a mind to exercise or
show your judgment do it in playing your own game when you have an
opportunity not in criticizing or meddling with or counselling the
play of others

Lastly if the game is not to be played rigorously according to the
rules above mentioned then moderate your desire of victory over your
adversary and be pleased with one over yourself Snatch not eagerly at
every advantage offered by his unskilfulness or inattention but point
out to him kindly that by such a move he places or leaves a piece in
danger and unsupported that by another he will put his king in a
perilous situation c By this generous civility so opposite to the
unfairness above forbidden you may indeed happen to lose the game to
your opponent but you will win what is better his esteem his respect
and his affection together with the silent approbation and goodwill of
impartial spectators



TO BENJAMIN VAUGHAN

                                             Passy Nov  

DEAR SIR

I have received several kind Letters from you which I have not
regularly answered They gave me however great Pleasure as they
acquainted me with your Welfare and that of your Family and other
Friends and I hope you will continue writing to me as often as you can
do it conveniently

I thank you much for the great Care and Pains you have taken in
regulating and correcting the Edition of those Papers Your Friendship
for me appears in almost every Page and if the Preservation of any of
them should prove of Use to the Publick it is to you that the Publick
will owe the Obligation In looking them over I have noted some Faults
of Impression that hurt the Sense and some other little Matters which
you will find all in a Sheet under the title of Errata You can best
judge whether it may be worth while to add any of them to the Errata
already printed or whether it may not be as well to reserve the whole
for Correction in another Edition if such should ever be Inclosd I
send a more perfect copy of the Chapter

If I should ever recover the Pieces that were in the Hands of my Son
and those I left among my Papers in America I think there may be enough
to make three more such Volumes of which a great part would be more
interesting

As to the Time of publishing of which you ask my Opinion I am not
furnishd with any Reasons or Ideas of Reasons on which to form any
Opinion Naturally I should suppose the Bookseller to be from Experience
the best Judge and I should be for leaving it to him

I did not write the Pamphlet you mention I know nothing of it I
suppose it is the same concerning which Dr Priestley formerly asked me
the same Question That for which he took it was intitled A
Dissertation on Liberty and Necessity Pleasure and Pain with these
Lines in the Title Page

    Whatever is is right But purblind Man
     Sees but a part o the Chain the nearest Link
     His Eye not carrying to that equal Beam
     That poises all above
                                          DRYDEN

       London Printed M D C C X X V

It was addressed to Mr J R that is James Ralph then a youth of
about my age and my intimate friend afterwards a political writer and
historian The purport of it was to prove the doctrine of fate from the
supposed attributes of God in some such manner as this that in
erecting and governing the world as he was infinitely wise he knew
what would be best infinitely good he must be disposed and infinitely
powerful he must be able to execute it consequently all is right
There were only an hundred copies printed of which I gave a few to
friends and afterwards disliking the piece as conceiving it might have
an ill tendency I burnt the rest except one copy the margin of which
was filled with manuscript notes by Lyons author of the Infallibility
of Human Judgment who was at that time another of my acquaintance in
London I was not nineteen years of age when it was written In  I
wrote a piece on the other side of the question which began with laying
for its foundation this fact That almost all men in all ages and
countries have at times made use of prayer Thence I reasoned that if
all things are ordained prayer must among the rest be ordained But as
prayer can produce no change in things that are ordained praying must
then be useless and an absurdity God would therefore not ordain praying
if everything else was ordained But praying exists therefore all
things are not ordained etc This pamphlet was never printed and the
manuscript has been long lost The great uncertainty I found in
metaphysical reasonings disgusted me and I quitted that kind of reading
and study for others more satisfactory

I return the Manuscripts you were so obliging as to send me I am
concernd at your having no other copys I hope these will get safe to
your hands I do not remember the Duke de Chaulnes showing me the Letter
you mention I have received Dr Crawfords book but not your Abstract
which I wait for as you desire

I send you also M Duponts Table Economique which I think an
excellent Thing as it contains in a clear Method all the principles of
that new sect called here les conomistes

Poor Henleys dying in that manner is inconceivable to me Is any Reason
given to account for it besides insanity

Remember me affectionately to all your good Family and believe me with
great Esteem my dear Friend yours most sincerely

THE WHISTLE

TO MADAME BRILLON

                                        Passy November  

I received my dear friends two letters one for Wednesday and one for
Saturday This is again Wednesday I do not deserve one for today
because I have not answered the former But indolent as I am and
averse to writing the fear of having no more of your pleasing epistles
if I do not contribute to the correspondence obliges me to take up my
pen and as Mr B has kindly sent me word that he sets out tomorrow
to see you instead of spending this Wednesday evening as I have done
its namesakes in your delightful company I sit down to spend it in
thinking of you in writing to you and in reading over and over again
your letters

I am charmed with your description of Paradise and with your plan of
living there and I approve much of your conclusion that in the mean
time we should draw all the good we can from this world In my opinion
we might all draw more good from it than we do and suffer less evil if
we would take care not to give too much for whistles For to me it
seems that most of the unhappy people we meet with are become so by
neglect of that caution

You ask what I mean You love stories and will excuse my telling one of
myself

When I was a child of seven years old my friends on a holiday filled
my pocket with coppers I went directly to a shop where they sold toys
for children and being charmed with the sound of a whistle that I
met by the way in the hands of another boy I voluntarily offered and
gave all my money for one I then came home and went whistling all over
the house much pleased with my whistle but disturbing all the
family My brothers and sisters and cousins understanding the bargain
I had made told me I had given four times as much for it as it was
worth put me in mind what good things I might have bought with the rest
of the money and laughed at me so much for my folly that I cried with
vexation and the reflection gave me more chagrin than the whistle
gave me pleasure

This however was afterwards of use to me the impression continuing on
my mind so that often when I was tempted to buy some unnecessary
thing I said to myself Dont give too much for the whistle and I
saved my money

As I grew up came into the world and observed the actions of men I
thought I met with many very many who gave too much for the whistle

When I saw one too ambitious of court favour sacrificing his time in
attendance on levees his repose his liberty his virtue and perhaps
his friends to attain it I have said to myself This man gives too
much for his whistle

When I saw another fond of popularity constantly employing himself in
political bustles neglecting his own affairs and ruining them by that
neglect He pays indeed said I too much for his whistle

If I knew a miser who gave up every kind of comfortable living all the
pleasure of doing good to others all the esteem of his fellowcitizens
and the joys of benevolent friendship for the sake of accumulating
wealth Poor man said I you pay too much for your whistle

When I met with a man of pleasure sacrificing every laudable
improvement of the mind or of his fortune to mere corporeal
sensations and ruining his health in their pursuit Mistaken man
said I you are providing pain for yourself instead of pleasure you
give too much for your whistle

If I see one fond of appearance or fine clothes fine houses fine
furniture fine equipages all above his fortune for which he contracts
debts and ends his career in a prison Alas say I he has paid
dear very dear for his whistle

When I see a beautiful sweettempered girl married to an illnatured
brute of a husband What a pity say I that she should pay so much
for a whistle

In short I conceive that great part of the miseries of mankind are
brought upon them by the false estimates they have made of the value of
things and by their giving too much for their whistles

Yet I ought to have charity for these unhappy people when I consider
that with all this wisdom of which I am boasting there are certain
things in the world so tempting for example the apples of King John
which happily are not to be bought for if they were put to sale by
auction I might very easily be led to ruin myself in the purchase and
find that I had once more given too much for the whistle

Adieu my dear friend and believe me ever yours very sincerely and with
unalterable affection

THE LORDS PRAYER



OLD VERSION

 Our Father which art in Heaven

 Hallowed be thy Name

 Thy Kingdom come

 Thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven

 Give us this Day our daily Bread

 Forgive us our Debts as we forgive our Debtors
   And lead us not into Temptation but deliver us from Evil


NEW VERSION BY B F

 Heavenly Father

 May all revere thee

 And become thy dutiful Children and faithful Subjects

 May thy Laws be obeyed on Earth as perfectly as they are in Heaven

 Provide for us this Day as thou hast hitherto daily done

 Forgive us our Trespasses and enable us likewise to forgive
   those that offend us

 Keep us out of Temptation and deliver us from Evil


Reasons for the Change of Expression

Old Version Our Father which art in Heaven

New VHeavenly Father is more concise equally expressive and
  better modern English

Old VHallowed be thy Name This seems to relate to an Observance
  among the Jews not to pronounce the proper or peculiar Name of God
  they deeming it a Profanation so to do We have in our Language no
  proper Name for God the Word God being a common or general Name
  expressing all chief Objects of Worship true or false The Word
  hallowed is almost obsolete People now have but an imperfect
  Conception of the Meaning of the Petition It is therefore proposed
  to change the expression into

New VMay all revere thee

Old VThy Kingdom come This Petition seems suited to the then
  Condition of the Jewish Nation Originally their State was a
  Theocracy God was their King Dissatisfied with that kind of
  Government they desired a visible earthly King in the manner of the
  Nations round them They had such Kings accordingly but their
  Offerings were due to God on many Occasions by the Jewish Law
  which when People could not pay or had forgotten as Debtors are apt
  to do it was proper to pray that those Debts might be forgiven Our
  Liturgy uses neither the Debtors of Matthew nor the indebted of
  Luke but instead of them speaks of those that trespass against us
  Perhaps the Considering it as a Christian Duty to forgive Debtors
  was by the Compilers thought an inconvenient Idea in a trading
  NationThere seems however something presumptuous in this Mode of
  Expression which has the Air of proposing ourselves as an Example of
  Goodness fit for God to imitate We hope you will at least be as
  good as we are you see we forgive one another and therefore we
  pray that you would forgive us Some have considered it in another
  sense Forgive us as we forgive others ie If we do not forgive
  others we pray that thou wouldst not forgive us But this being a
  kind of conditional Imprecation against ourselves seems improper
  in such a Prayer and therefore it may be better to say humbly 
  modestly

New VForgive us our Trespasses and enable us likewise to forgive
  those that offend us This instead of assuming that we have already
  in  of ourselves the Grace of Forgiveness acknowledges our
  Dependance on God the Fountain of Mercy for any Share we may have in
  it praying that he would communicate of it to  us

Old VAnd lead us not into Temptation The Jews had a Notion that
  God sometimes tempted or directed or permitted the Tempting of
  People Thus it was said he tempted Pharaoh directed Satan to tempt
  Job and a false Prophet to tempt Ahab c Under this Persuasion it
  was natural for them to pray that he would not put them to such
  severe Trials We now suppose that Temptation so far as it is
  supernatural comes from the Devil only and this Petition continued
  conveys a Suspicion which in our present Conception seems unworthy of
  God therefore might be altered to

New VKeep us out of Temptation Happiness was not increasd by the
  Change and they had reason to wish and pray for a Return of the
  Theocracy or Government of God Christians in these Times have other
  Ideas when they speak of the Kingdom of God such as are perhaps more
  adequately expressd by

New VAnd become thy dutiful Children  faithful Subjects

Old VThy Will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven

New VMay thy Laws be obeyed on Earth as perfectly as they are in
  Heaven

Old VGive us this Day our daily Bread Give us what is ours
  seems to put us in a Claim of Right and to contain too little of the
  grateful Acknowledgment and Sense of Dependance that becomes
  Creatures who live on the daily Bounty of their Creator Therefore it
  is changed to

New VProvide for us this Day as thou hast hitherto daily done

Old VForgive us our Debts as we forgive our Debtors Matthew

  Forgive us our Sins for we also forgive every one that is indebted
     to us Luke



THE LEVE



In the first chapter of Job we have an account of a transaction said to
have arisen in the court or at the leve of the best of all possible
princes or of governments by a single person viz that of God himself

At this leve in which the sons of God were assembled Satan also
appeared

It is probable the writer of that ancient book took his idea of this
leve from those of the eastern monarchs of the age he lived in

It is to this day usual at the leves of princes to have persons
assembled who are enemies to each other who seek to obtain favor by
whispering calumny and detraction and thereby ruining those that
distinguish themselves by their virtue and merit And kings frequently
ask a familiar question or two of every one in the circle merely to
show their benignity These circumstances are particularly exemplified
in this relation

If a modern king for instance finds a person in the circle who has not
lately been there he naturally asks him how he has passed his time
since he last had the pleasure of seeing him the gentleman perhaps
replies that he has been in the country to view his estates and visit
some friends Thus Satan being asked whence he cometh answers From
going to and fro in the earth and walking up and down in it And being
further asked whether he had considered the uprightness and fidelity of
the princes servant Job he immediately displays all the malignance of
the designing courtier by answering with another question Doth Job
serve God for naught Hast thou not given him immense wealth and
protected him in the possession of it Deprive him of that and he will
curse thee to thy face In modern phrase Take away his places and his
pensions and your Majesty will soon find him in the opposition

This whisper against Job had its effect He was delivered into the power
of his adversary who deprived him of his fortune destroyed his family
and completely ruined him

The book of Job is called by divines a sacred poem and with the rest
of the Holy Scriptures is understood to be written for our instruction

What then is the instruction to be gathered from this supposed
transaction

Trust not a single person with the government of your state For if the
Deity himself being the monarch may for a time give way to calumny and
suffer it to operate the destruction of the best of subjects what
mischief may you not expect from such power in a mere man though the
best of men from whom the truth is often industriously hidden and to
whom falsehood is often presented in its place by artful interested
and malicious courtiers

And be cautious in trusting him even with limited powers lest sooner or
later he sap and destroy those limits and render himself absolute

For by the disposal of places he attaches to himself all the
placeholders with their numerous connexions and also all the expecters
and hopers of places which will form a strong party in promoting his
views By various political engagements for the interest of neighbouring
states or princes he procures their aid in establishing his own
personal power So that through the hopes of emolument in one part of
his subjects and the fear of his resentment in the other all
opposition falls before him



PROPOSED NEW VERSION OF THE BIBLE



TO THE PRINTER OF

SIR

It is now more than one hundred and seventy years since the translation
of our common English Bible The language in that time is much changed
and the style being obsolete and thence less agreeable is perhaps one
reason why the reading of that excellent book is of late so much
neglected I have therefore thought it would be well to procure a new
version in which preserving the sense the turn of phrase and manner
of expression should be modern I do not pretend to have the necessary
abilities for such a work myself I throw out the hint for the
consideration of the learned and only venture to send you a few verses
of the first chapter of Job which may serve as a sample of the kind of
version I would recommend

PART OF THE FIRST CHAPTER OF JOB MODERNIZED

OLD TEXT

      NEW VERSION

Verse  Now there was a
day when the sons of God
came to present themselves before
the Lord and Satan came
also amongst them

      Verse  And it being leve
      day in heaven all Gods nobility
      came to court to present
      themselves before him
      and Satan also appeared in the
      circle as one of the ministry

 And the Lord said unto
Satan Whence comest thou
Then Satan answered the Lord
and said From going to and
fro in the earth and from
walking up and down in it

       And God said to Satan
      You have been some time absent
      where were you And
      Satan answered I have been
      at my countryseat and in
      different places visiting my
      friends

 And the Lord said unto
Satan Hast thou considered
my servant Job that there is
none like him in the earth a
perfect and an upright man
one that feareth God and
escheweth evil

       And God said Well
      what think you of Lord Job
      You see he is my best friend
      a perfectly honest man full
      of respect for me and avoiding
      every thing that might offend
      me

 Then Satan answered the
Lord and said Doth Job fear
God for naught

       And Satan answered
      Does your Majesty imagine
      that his good conduct is the
      effect of mere personal attachment
      and affection

 Hast thou not made an
hedge about his house and
about all that he hath on every
side Thou hast blessed the
work of his hands and his
substance is increased in the
land

       Have you not protected
      him and heaped your benefits
      upon him till he is grown
      enormously rich

 But put forth thine
hand now and touch all that
he hath and he will curse thee
to thy face

       Try himonly withdraw
      your favor turn him out
      of his places and withhold his
      pensions and you will soon
      find him in the opposition

Dear Sir

Your kind Letter of September  came to hand but very lately the
Bearer having staied long in Holland I always rejoice to hear of your
being still employd in experimental Researches into Nature and of the
Success you meet with The rapid Progress true Science now makes
occasions my regretting sometimes that I was born so soon It is
impossible to imagine the Height to which may be carried in a thousand
years the Power of Man over Matter We may perhaps learn to deprive
large Masses of their Gravity and give them absolute Levity for the
sake of easy Transport Agriculture may diminish its Labour and double
its Produce all Diseases may by sure means be prevented or cured not
excepting even that of Old Age and our Lives lengthened at pleasure
even beyond the antediluvian Standard O that moral Science were in as
fair a way of Improvement that Men would cease to be Wolves to one
another and that human Beings would at length learn what they now
improperly call Humanity

I am glad my little Paper on the Aurora Borealis pleased If it should
occasion further Enquiry and so produce a better Hypothesis it will
not be wholly useless I am ever with the greatest and most sincere
Esteem dear Sir yours very affectionately

SIR

I have received but lately the Letter your Excellency did me the honour
of writing to me in Recommendation of the Marquis de la Fayette His
modesty detained it long in his own Hands We became acquainted
however from the time of his Arrival at Paris and his Zeal for the
Honour of our Country his Activity in our Affairs here and his firm
Attachment to our Cause and to you impressd me with the same Regard
and Esteem for him that your Excellencys Letter would have done had it
been immediately delivered to me

Should peace arrive after another Campaign or two and afford us a
little Leisure I should be happy to see your Excellency in Europe and
to accompany you if my Age and Strength would permit in visiting some
of its ancient and most famous Kingdoms You would on this side of the
Sea enjoy the great Reputation you have acquird pure and free from
those little Shades that the Jealousy and Envy of a Mans Countrymen and
Cotemporaries are ever endeavouring to cast over living Merit Here you
would know and enjoy what Posterity will say of Washington For 
Leagues have nearly the same Effect with  Years The feeble Voice of
those grovelling Passions cannot extend so far either in Time or
Distance At present I enjoy that Pleasure for you as I frequently hear
the old Generals of this martial Country who study the Maps of
America and mark upon them all your Operations speak with sincere
Approbation and great Applause of your conduct and join in giving you
the Character of one of the greatest Captains of the Age

I must soon quit the Scene but you may live to see our Country nourish
as it will amazingly and rapidly after the War is over Like a Field of
young Indian Corn which long Fair weather and Sunshine had enfeebled
and discolored and which in that weak State by a Thunder Gust of
violent Wind Hail and Rain seemd to be threatend with absolute
Destruction yet the Storm being past it recovers fresh Verdure shoots
up with double Vigour and delights the Eye not of its Owner only but
of every observing Traveller

The best Wishes that can be formd for your Health Honour and
Happiness ever attend you from your Excellencys most obedient and most
humble servant

TO MISS GEORGIANA SHIPLEY

                                             Passy Oct  

It is long very long my dear Friend since I had the great Pleasure of
hearing from you and receiving any of your very pleasing Letters But
it is my fault I have long omitted my Part of the Correspondence Those
who love to receive Letters should write Letters I wish I could safely
promise an Amendment of that Fault But besides the Indolence attending
Age and growing upon us with it my Time is engrossd by too much
Business and I have too many Inducements to postpone doing what I feel
I ought to do for my own Sake and what I can never resolve to omit
entirely

Your Translations from Horace as far as I can judge of Poetry and
Translations are very good That of the Qu qu ruitis is so
suitable to the Times that the Conclusion in your Version seems to
threaten like a Prophecy and methinks there is at least some Appearance
of Danger that it may be fulfilled I am unhappily an Enemy yet I think
there has been enough of Blood spilt and I wish what is left in the
Veins of that once lovd People may be spared by a Peace solid and
everlasting

It is a great while since I have heard any thing of the good Bishop
Strange that so simple a Character should sufficiently distinguish one
of that sacred Body Donnezmoi de ses Nouvelles I have been some
time flatterd with the Expectation of seeing the Countenance of that
most honoured and ever beloved Friend delineated by your Pencil The
Portrait is said to have been long on the way but is not yet arrivd
nor can I hear where it is

Indolent as I have confessd myself to be I could not you see miss
this good and safe Opportunity of sending you a few Lines with my best
Wishes for your Happiness and that of the whole dear and amiable Family
in whose sweet Society I have spent so many happy Hours Mr Jones
tells me he shall have a Pleasure in being the Bearer of my Letter of
which I make no doubt I learn from him that to your Drawing and
Music and Painting and Poetry and Latin you have added a Proficiency
in Chess so that you are as the French say tout plein de talens
May they and you fall to the Lot of one that shall duly value them and
love you as much as I do Adieu

TO RICHARD PRICE

                                             Passy Oct  

DEAR SIR

Besides the Pleasure of their Company I had the great Satisfaction of
hearing by your two valuable Friends and learning from your Letter
that you enjoy a good State of Health May God continue it as well for
the Good of Mankind as for your Comfort I thank you much for the second
Edition of your excellent Pamphlet I forwarded that you sent to
Mr Dana he being in Holland I wish also to see the Piece you have
written as Mr Jones tells me on Toleration I do not expect that your
new Parliament will be either wiser or honester than the last All
Projects to procure an honest one by Place Bills c appear to me
vain and Impracticable The true Cure I imagine is to be found only
in rendring all Places unprofitable and the King too poor to give
Bribes and Pensions Till this is done which can only be by a
Revolution and I think you have not Virtue enough left to procure one
your Nation will always be plundered and obliged to pay by Taxes the
Plunderers for Plundering and Ruining Liberty and Virtue therefore join
in the call COME OUT OF HER MY PEOPLE

I am fully of your Opinion respecting religious Tests but tho the
People of Massachusetts have not in their new Constitution kept quite
clear of them yet if we consider what that People were  Years ago
we must allow they have gone great Lengths in Liberality of Sentiment on
religious Subjects and we may hope for greater Degrees of Perfection
when their Constitution some years hence shall be revised If
Christian Preachers had continued to teach as Christ and his Apostles
did without Salaries and as the Quakers now do I imagine Tests would
never have existed for I think they were invented not so much to
secure Religion itself as the Emoluments of it When a Religion is
good I conceive that it will support itself and when it cannot
support itself and God does not take care to support so that its
Professors are obligd to call for the help of the Civil Power it is a
sign I apprehend of its being a bad one But I shall be out of my
Depth if I wade any deeper in Theology and I will not trouble you with
Politicks nor with News which are almost as uncertain but conclude
with a heartfelt Wish to embrace you once more and enjoy your sweet
Society in Peace among our honest worthy ingenious Friends at the
London Adieu

DIALOGUE BETWEEN FRANKLIN AND THE GOUT

                                      Midnight October  

FRANKLIN Eh Oh Eh What have I done to merit these cruel sufferings

GOUT Many things you have ate and drank too freely and too much
indulged those legs of yours in their indolence

FRANKLIN Who is it that accuses me

GOUT It is I even I the Gout

FRANKLIN What my enemy in person

GOUT No not your enemy

FRANKLIN I repeat it my enemy for you would not only torment my body
to death but ruin my good name you reproach me as a glutton and a
tippler now all the world that knows me will allow that I am neither
the one nor the other

GOUT The world may think as it pleases it is always very complaisant
to itself and sometimes to its friends but I very well know that the
quantity of meat and drink proper for a man who takes a reasonable
degree of exercise would be too much for another who never takes any

FRANKLIN I takeEh Ohas much exerciseEhas I can Madam Gout
You know my sedentary state and on that account it would seem Madam
Gout as if you might spare me a little seeing it is not altogether my
own fault

GOUT Not a jot your rhetoric and your politeness are thrown away your
apology avails nothing If your situation in life is a sedentary one
your amusements your recreations at least should be active You ought
to walk or ride or if the weather prevents that play at billiards But
let us examine your course of life While the mornings are long and you
have leisure to go abroad what do you do Why instead of gaining an
appetite for breakfast by salutary exercise you amuse yourself with
books pamphlets or newspapers which commonly are not worth the
reading Yet you eat an inordinate breakfast four dishes of tea with
cream and one or two buttered toasts with slices of hung beef which I
fancy are not things the most easily digested Immediately afterward you
sit down to write at your desk or converse with persons who apply to
you on business Thus the time passes till one without any kind of
bodily exercise But all this I could pardon in regard as you say to
your sedentary condition But what is your practice after dinner
Walking in the beautiful gardens of those friends with whom you have
dined would be the choice of men of sense yours is to be fixed down to
chess where you are found engaged for two or three hours This is your
perpetual recreation which is the least eligible of any for a sedentary
man because instead of accelerating the motion of the fluids the
rigid attention it requires helps to retard the circulation and obstruct
internal secretions Wrapt in the speculations of this wretched game
you destroy your constitution What can be expected from such a course
of living but a body replete with stagnant humours ready to fall a
prey to all kinds of dangerous maladies if I the Gout did not
occasionally bring you relief by agitating those humours and so
purifying or dissipating them If it was in some nook or alley in Paris
deprived of walks that you played awhile at chess after dinner this
might be excusable but the same taste prevails with you in Passy
Auteuil Montmartre or Sanoy places where there are the finest gardens
and walks a pure air beautiful women and most agreeable and
instructive conversation all which you might enjoy by frequenting the
walks But these are rejected for this abominable game of chess Fie
then Mr Franklin But amidst my instructions I had almost forgot to
administer my wholesome corrections so take that twingeand that

FRANKLIN Oh Eh Oh Ohhh As much instruction as you please Madam
Gout and as many reproaches but pray Madam a truce with your
corrections

GOUT No Sir noI will not abate a particle of what is so much for
your goodtherefore

FRANKLIN Oh EhhhIt is not fair to say I take no exercise when I do
very often going out to dine and returning in my carriage

GOUT That of all imaginable exercises is the most slight and
insignificant if you allude to the motion of a carriage suspended on
springs By observing the degree of heat obtained by different kinds of
motion we may form an estimate of the quantity of exercise given by
each Thus for example if you turn out to walk in winter with cold
feet in an hours time you will be in a glow all over ride on
horseback the same effect will scarcely be perceived by four hours
round trotting but if you loll in a carriage such as you have
mentioned you may travel all day and gladly enter the last inn to
warm your feet by a fire Flatter yourself then no longer that half an
hours airing in your carriage deserves the name of exercise Providence
has appointed few to roll in carriages while he has given to all a pair
of legs which are machines infinitely more commodious and serviceable
Be grateful then and make a proper use of yours Would you know how
they forward the circulation of your fluids in the very action of
transporting you from place to place observe when you walk that all
your weight is alternately thrown from one leg to the other this
occasions a great pressure on the vessels of the foot and repels their
contents when relieved by the weight being thrown on the other foot
the vessels of the first are allowed to replenish and by a return of
this weight this repulsion again succeeds thus accelerating the
circulation of the blood The heat produced in any given time depends
on the degree of this acceleration the fluids are shaken the humours
attenuated the secretions facilitated and all goes well the cheeks
are ruddy and health is established Behold your fair friend at
Auteuil a lady who received from bounteous nature more really
useful science than half a dozen such pretenders to philosophy as you
have been able to extract from all your books When she honours you with
a visit it is on foot She walks all hours of the day and leaves
indolence and its concomitant maladies to be endured by her horses In
this see at once the preservative of her health and personal charms But
when you go to Auteuil you must have your carriage though it is no
further from Passy to Auteuil than from Auteuil to Passy

FRANKLIN Your reasonings grow very tiresome

GOUT I stand corrected I will be silent and continue my office take
that and that

FRANKLIN Oh Ohh Talk on I pray you

GOUT No no I have a good number of twinges for you tonight and you
may be sure of some more tomorrow

FRANKLIN What with such a fever I shall go distracted Oh Eh Can no
one bear it for me

GOUT Ask that of your horses they have served you faithfully

FRANKLIN How can you so cruelly sport with my torments

GOUT Sport I am very serious I have here a list of offences against
your own health distinctly written and can justify every stroke
inflicted on you

FRANKLIN Read it then

GOUT It is too long a detail but I will briefly mention some
particulars

FRANKLIN Proceed I am all attention

GOUT Do you remember how often you have promised yourself the
following morning a walk in the grove of Boulogne in the garden de la
Muette or in your own garden and have violated your promise alleging
at one time it was too cold at another too warm too windy too moist
or what else you pleased when in truth it was too nothing but your
insuperable love of ease

FRANKLIN That I confess may have happened occasionally probably ten
times in a year

GOUT Your confession is very far short of the truth the gross amount
is one hundred and ninetynine times

FRANKLIN Is it possible

GOUT So possible that it is fact you may rely on the accuracy of my
statement You know M Brillons gardens and what fine walks they
contain you know the handsome flight of an hundred steps which lead
from the terrace above to the lawn below You have been in the practice
of visiting this amiable family twice a week after dinner and it is a
maxim of your own that a man may take as much exercise in walking a
mile up and down stairs as in ten on level ground What an
opportunity was here for you to have had exercise in both these ways
Did you embrace it and how often

FRANKLIN I cannot immediately answer that question

GOUT I will do it for you not once

FRANKLIN Not once

GOUT Even so During the summer you went there at six oclock You
found the charming lady with her lovely children and friends eager to
walk with you and entertain you with their agreeable conversation and
what has been your choice Why to sit on the terrace satisfying
yourself with the fine prospect and passing your eye over the beauties
of the garden below without taking one step to descend and walk about
in them On the contrary you call for tea and the chessboard and lo
you are occupied in your seat till nine oclock and that besides two
hours play after dinner and then instead of walking home which would
have bestirred you a little you step into your carriage How absurd to
suppose that all this carelessness can be reconcilable with health
without my interposition

FRANKLIN I am convinced now of the justness of poor Richards remark
that Our debts and our sins are always greater than we think for

GOUT So it is You philosophers are sages in your maxims and fools in
your conduct

FRANKLIN But do you charge among my crimes that I return in a carriage
from Mr Brillons

GOUT Certainly for having been seated all the while you cannot
object the fatigue of the day and cannot want therefore the relief of a
carriage

FRANKLIN What then would you have me do with my carriage

GOUT Burn it if you choose you would at least get heat out of it once
in this way or if you dislike that proposal heres another for you
observe the poor peasants who work in the vineyards and grounds about
the villages of Passy Auteuil Chaillot c you may find every day
among these deserving creatures four or five old men and women bent
and perhaps crippled by weight of years and too long and too great
labour After a most fatiguing day these people have to trudge a mile
or two to their smoky huts Order your coachman to set them down This
is an act that will be good for your soul and at the same time after
your visit to the Brillons if you return on foot that will be good for
your body

FRANKLIN Ah how tiresome you are

GOUT Well then to my office it should not be forgotten that I am
your physician There

FRANKLIN Ohhh what a devil of a physician

GOUT How ungrateful you are to say so Is it not I who in the
character of your physician have saved you from the palsy dropsy and
apoplexy one or other of which would have done for you long ago but
for me

FRANKLIN I submit and thank you for the past but entreat the
discontinuance of your visits for the future for in my mind one had
better die than be cured so dolefully Permit me just to hint that I
have also not been unfriendly to you I never feed physician or quack
of any kind to enter the list against you if then you do not leave me
to my repose it may be said you are ungrateful too

GOUT I can scarcely acknowledge that as any objection As to quacks I
despise them they may kill you indeed but cannot injure me And as to
regular physicians they are at last convinced that the gout in such a
subject as you are is no disease but a remedy and wherefore cure a
remedybut to our businessthere

FRANKLIN Oh ohfor Heavens sake leave me and I promise faithfully
never more to play at chess but to take exercise daily and live
temperately

GOUT I know you too well You promise fair but after a few months of
good health you will return to your old habits your fine promises will

the account and I will go But I leave you with an assurance of
visiting you again at a proper time and place for my object is your
good and you are sensible now that I am your real friend



THE HANDSOME AND DEFORMED LEG



There are two Sorts of People in the World who with equal Degrees of
Health  Wealth and the other Comforts of Life become the one happy
and the other miserable This arises very much from the different Views
in which they consider Things Persons and Events and the Effect of
those different Views upon their own Minds

In whatever Situation Men can be placd they may find Conveniencies 
Inconveniencies In whatever Company they may find Persons 
Conversation more or less pleasing At whatever Table they may meet
with Meats  Drinks of better and worse Taste Dishes better  worse
dressd In whatever Climate they will find good and bad Weather Under
whatever Government they may find good  bad Laws and good  bad
Administration of those Laws In every Poem or Work of Genius they may
see Faults and Beauties In almost every Face  every Person they may
discover fine Features  Defects good  bad Qualities

Under these Circumstances the two Sorts of People above mentiond fix
their Attention those who are to be happy on the Conveniencies of
Things the pleasant Parts of Conversation the welldressd Dishes the
Goodness of the Wines the fine Weather c and enjoy all with
Chearfulness Those who are to be unhappy think  speak only of the
contraries Hence they are continually discontented themselves and by
their Remarks sour the Pleasures of Society offend personally many
People and make themselves everywhere disagreable If this Turn of Mind
was founded in Nature such unhappy Persons would be the more to be
pitied But as the Disposition to criticise  be disgusted is perhaps
taken up originally by Imitation and is unawares grown into a Habit
which tho at present strong may nevertheless be cured when those who
have it are convincd of its bad Effects on their Felicity I hope this
little Admonition may be of Service to them and put them on changing a
Habit which tho in the Exercise it is chiefly an Act of Imagination
yet has serious Consequences in Life as it brings on real Griefs and
Misfortunes For as many are offended by  nobody well loves this Sort
of People no one shows them more than the most common civility and
respect and scarcely that and this frequently puts them out of humour
and draws them into disputes and contentions If they aim at obtaining
some advantage in rank or fortune nobody wishes them success or will
stir a step or speak a word to favour their pretensions If they incur
public censure or disgrace no one will defend or excuse and many join
to aggravate their misconduct and render them completely odious If
these people will not change this bad habit and condescend to be
pleased with what is pleasing without fretting themselves and others
about the contraries it is good for others to avoid an acquaintance
with them which is always disagreeable and sometimes very
inconvenient especially when one finds ones self entangled in their
quarrels

An old philosophical friend of mine was grown from experience very
cautious in this particular and carefully avoided any intimacy with
such people He had like other philosophers a thermometer to show him
the heat of the weather and a barometer to mark when it was likely to
prove good or bad but there being no instrument invented to discover
at first sight this unpleasing disposition in a person he for that
purpose made use of his legs one of which was remarkably handsome the
other by some accident crooked and deformed If a Stranger at the
first interview regarded his ugly Leg more than his handsome one he
doubted him If he spoke of it  took no notice of the handsome Leg
that was sufficient to determine my Philosopher to have no further
Acquaintance with him Every body has not this twolegged Instrument
but every one with a little Attention may observe Signs of that
carping faultfinding Disposition  take the same Resolution of
avoiding the Acquaintance of those infected with it I therefore advise
those critical querulous discontented unhappy People that if they
wish to be respected and belovd by others  happy in themselves they
should leave off looking at the ugly Leg



TO MISS GEORGIANA SHIPLEY

 Must now be next its End as I have compleated my th Year I could
wish to see my dear Friends of your Family once more before I withdraw
but I see no Prospect of enjoying that Felicity Let me at least have
that of hearing from you a little oftener

I do not understand the Coldness you mention of the Nights in the
Desert I never before heard of such an Observation If you have learnt
what was the Degree of cold and how it was observed and what Difference
between the Night and the Day you will oblige me by communicating it I
like to see that you retain a Taste for Philosophical Enquiries

I recd also your very kind Letter by Made  illegible in MS

and I felicitate you as the French say on the Increase of your
Brothers Family

Accept my Thanks for your Friendly Verses and good Wishes How many
Talents you possess Painting Poetry Languages etc etc All

with its Father alone the delightful Walks in the Gardens and
neighbouring Grounds Pleasures past and gone forever Since I have had
your Fathers Picture I am grown more covetous of the rest every time I

more Trouble I must however beg that you will make me up a compleat
Set of your little Profiles which are more easily done You formerly

TO DAVID HARTLEY

                                        Passy December  

MY DEAR FRIEND

I received your favour of September th containing your very
judicious proposition of securing the spectators in the opera and play
houses from the danger of fire I communicated it where I thought it
might be useful You will see by the enclosed that the subject has been
under consideration here Your concern for the security of life even
the lives of your enemies does honour to your heart and your humanity
But what are the lives of a few idle haunters of play houses compared
with the many thousands of worthy men and honest industrious families
butchered and destroyed by this devilish war Oh that we could find some
happy invention to stop the spreading of the flames and put an end to
so horrid a conflagration Adieu I am ever yours most affectionately

                                          Boston March  

Extract of a Letter from Captain Gerrish of the New England Militia
dated Albany March 

The Peltry taken in the Expedition see the Account of the Expedition to
Oswegatchie on the River St Laurence in our Paper of the st
Instant will as you see amount to a good deal of Money The

    being fixed to the Hoop of his Scalp Most of the Farmers
    appear by the Hair to have been young or middleaged Men

    With these Packs the Chiefs send to your Excellency the
    following Speech delivered by Conejogatchie in Council
    interpreted by the elder Moore the Trader and taken down by
    me in Writing

        Father

        We send you herewith many Scalps that you may see we are
        not idle Friends

                                              A blue Belt

        Father

        We wish you to send these Scalps over the Water to the
        great King that he may regard them and be refreshed
        and that he may see our faithfulness in destroying his
        Enemies and be convinced that his Presents have not been
        made to ungrateful people

                   A blue and white Belt with red Tassels

        Father

        Attend to what I am now going to say it is a Matter of
        much Weight The great Kings Enemies are many and they
        grow fast in Number They were formerly like young
        Panthers they could neither bite nor scratch we could
        play with them safely we feared nothing they could do to
        us But now their Bodies are become big as the Elk and
        strong as the Buffalo they have also got great and sharp
        Claws They have driven us out of our Country for taking
        part in your Quarrel We expect the great King will give
        us another Country that our Children may live after us
        and be his Friends and Children as we are Say this for
        us to the great King To enforce it we give this Belt

                     A great white Belt with blue Tassels

        Father

        We have only to say farther that your Traders exact more
        than ever for their Goods and our hunting is lessened by
        the War so that we have fewer Skins to give for them
        This ruins us Think of some Remedy We are poor and you
        have Plenty of every Thing We know you will send us
        Powder and Guns and Knives and Hatchets but we also
        want Shirts and Blankets

                                      A little white Belt

    I do not doubt but that your Excellency will think it proper
    to give some farther Encouragement to those honest People
    The high Prices they complain of are the necessary Effect of
    the War Whatever Presents may be sent for them through my
    Hands shall be distributed with Prudence and Fidelity I
    have the Honour of being your Excellencys most obedient

                           And most humble Servant
                                            JAMES CRAUFURD

It was at first proposed to bury these Scalps but Lieutenant
Fitzgerald who you know has got Leave of Absence to go to Ireland on
his private Affairs said he thought it better they should proceed to
their Destination and if they were given to him he would undertake to
carry them to England and hang them all up in some dark Night on the
Trees in St Jamess Park where they could be seen from the King and
Queens Palaces in the Morning for that the Sight of them might perhaps
strike Muley Ishmael as he called him with some Compunction of
Conscience They were accordingly delivered to Fitz and he has brought
them safe hither Tomorrow they go with his Baggage in a Waggon for
Boston and will probably be there in a few Days after this Letter

                                            I am c
                                                  SAMUEL GERRISH


                                                Boston March 

Monday last arrived here Lieutenant Fitzgerald above mentioned and
Yesterday the Waggon with the Scalps Thousands of People are flocking
to see them this Morning and all Mouths are full of Execrations Fixing
them to the Trees is not approved It is now proposed to make them up in
decent little Packets seal and direct them one to the King containing
a Sample of every Sort for his Museum one to the Queen with some of
Women and little Children the Rest to be distributed among both Houses
of Parliament a double Quantity to the Bishops

MR WILLIS

Please to insert in your useful Paper the following Copy of a Letter
from Commodore Jones directed

    TO SIR JOSEPH YORK AMBASSADOR FROM THE KING OF ENGLAND TO
    THE STATESGENERAL OF THE UNITED PROVINCES

    Ipswich New England March  

    SIR

    I have lately seen a memorial said to have been presented
    by your Excellency to their High Mightinesses the
    Statesgeneral in which you are pleased to qualify me with
    the title of pirate

    A pirate is defined to be hostis humani generis an enemy
    to all mankind It happens Sir that I am an enemy to no
    part of mankind except your nation the English which
    nation at the same time comes much more within the
    definition being actually an enemy to and at war with one
    whole quarter of the world America considerable part of
    Asia and Africa a great part of Europe and in a fair way of
    being at war with the rest

    A pirate makes war for the sake of rapine This is not the
    kind of war I am engaged in against England Ours is a war in
    defence of liberty  the most just of all wars and of
    our properties which your nation would have taken from us
    without our consent in violation of our rights and by an
    armed force Yours therefore is a war of rapine of
    course a piratical war and those who approve of it and are
    engaged in it more justly deserve the name of pirates
    which you bestow on me It is indeed a war that coincides
    with the general spirit of your nation Your common people in
    their alehouses sing the twentyfour songs of Robin Hood
    and applaud his deerstealing and his robberies on the
    highway those who have just learning enough to read are
    delighted with your histories of the pirates and of the
    buccaniers and even your scholars in the universities study
    Quintus Curtius and are taught to admire Alexander for what
    they call his conquests in the Indies Severe laws and the
    hangmen keep down the effects of this spirit somewhat among
    yourselves though in your little Island you have
    nevertheless more highway robberies than there are in all the
    rest of Europe put together but a foreign war gives it full
    scope It is then that with infinite pleasure it lets
    itself loose to strip of their property honest merchants
    employed in the innocent and useful occupation of supplying
    the mutual wants of mankind Hence having lately no war with
    your ancient enemies rather than be without a war you chose
    to make one upon your friends In this your piratical war
    with America the mariners of your fleets and the owners of
    your privateers were animated against us by the act of your
    Parliament which repealed the law of God Thou shalt not
    steal by declaring it lawful for them to rob us of all our
    property that they could meet with on the ocean This act
    too had a retrospect and going beyond bulls of pardon
    declared that all the robberies you had committed previous
    to the act should be deemed just and lawful Your soldiers
    too were promised the plunder of our cities and your
    officers were flattered with the division of our lands You
    had even the baseness to corrupt our servants the sailors
    employed by us and encourage them to rob their masters and
    bring to you the ships and goods they were entrusted with Is
    there any society of pirates on the sea or land who in
    declaring wrong to be right and right wrong have less
    authority than your parliament Do any of them more justly
    than your parliament deserve the title you bestow on me

    You will tell me that we forfeited all our estates by our
    refusal to pay the taxes your nation would have imposed on us
    without the consent of our colony parliaments Have you then
    forgotten the incontestable principle which was the
    foundation of Hambdens glorious lawsuit with Charles the
    first that what an English king has no right to demand an
    English subject has a right to refuse But you cannot so
    soon have forgotten the instructions of your late honorable
    father who being himself a sound Whig taught you certainly
    the principles of the Revolution and that if subjects
    might in some cases forfeit their property kings also might
    forfeit their title and all claim to the allegiance of their
    subjects I must then suppose you well acquainted with those
    Whig principles on which permit me Sir to ask a few
    questions

    Is not protection as justly due from a king to his people
    as obedience from the people to their king

    If then a king declares his people to be out of his
    protection

    If he violates and deprives them of their constitutional
    rights

    If he wages war against them

    If he plunders their merchants ravages their coasts burns
    their towns and destroys their lives

    If he hires foreign mercenaries to help him in their
    destruction

    If he engages savages to murder their defenceless farmers
    women and children

    If he cruelly forces such of his subjects as fall into his
    hands to bear arms against their country and become
    executioners of their friends and brethren

    If he sells others of them into bondage in Africa and the
    East Indies

    If he excites domestic insurrections among their servants
    and encourages servants to murder their masters

    Does not so atrocious a conduct towards his subjects
    dissolve their allegiance

    If not please to say how or by what means it can possibly
    be dissolved

    All this horrible wickedness and barbarity has been and
    daily is practised by the King your master as you call
    him in your memorial upon the Americans whom he is still
    pleased to claim as his subjects

    During these six years past he has destroyed not less than
    forty thousand of those subjects by battles on land or sea
    or by starving them or poisoning them to death in the
    unwholesome air with the unwholesome food of his prisons
    And he has wasted the lives of at least an equal number of
    his own soldiers and sailors many of whom have been forced
    into this odious service and dragged from their families
    and friends by the outrageous violence of his illegal
    pressgangs You are a gentleman of letters and have read
    history do you recollect any instance of any tyrant since
    the beginning of the world who in the course of so few
    years had done so much mischief by murdering so many of his
    own people Let us view one of the worst and blackest of
    them Nero He put to death a few of his courtiers placemen
    and pensioners and among the rest his tutor Had George
    the Third done the same and no more his crime though
    detestable as an act of lawless power might have been as
    useful to his nation as that of Nero was hurtful to Rome
    considering the different characters and merits of the
    sufferers Nero indeed wished that the people of Rome had but
    one neck that he might behead them all by one stroke but
    this was a simple wish George is carrying the wish as fast
    as he can into execution and by continuing in his present
    course a few years longer will have destroyed more of the
    British people than Nero could have found inhabitants in
    Rome Hence the expression of Milton in speaking of Charles
    the First that he was Nerone Neronior is still more
    applicable to George the third Like Nero and all other
    tyrants while they lived he indeed has his flatterers his
    addressers his applauders Pensions places and hopes of
    preferment can bribe even bishops to approve his conduct but
    when those fulsome purchased addresses and panegyrics are
    sunk and lost in oblivion or contempt impartial history will
    step forth speak honest truth and rank him among public
    calamities The only difference will be that plagues
    pestilences and famines are of this world and arise from
    the nature of things but voluntary malice mischief and
    murder are from hell and this King will therefore stand
    foremost in the list of diabolical bloody and execrable
    tyrants His basebought parliaments too who sell him their
    souls and extort from the people the money with which they
    aid his destructive purposes as they share his guilt will
    share his infamyparliaments who to please him have
    repeatedly by different votes year after year dipped their
    hands in human blood insomuch that methinks I see it dried
    and caked so thick upon them that if they could wash it off
    in the Thames which flows under their windows the whole
    river would run red to the ocean

    One is provoked by enormous wickedness but one is ashamed
    and humiliated at the view of human baseness It afflicts me
    therefore to see a gentleman of Sir Joseph Yorks education
    and talents for the sake of a red riband and a paltry
    stipend mean enough to style such a monster his master
    wear his livery and hold himself ready at his command even
    to cut the throats of fellow subjects This makes it
    impossible for me to end my letter with the civility of a
    compliment and obliges me to subscribe myself simply

                      Whom you are pleased to style a pirate



TO JOHN THORNTON

                                              Passy May  

SIR

I received the letter you did me the honour of writing to me and am
much obliged by your kind present of a book The relish for reading of
poetry had long since left me but there is something so new in the
manner so easy and yet so correct in the language so clear in the
expression yet concise and so just in the sentiments that I have read
the whole with great pleasure and some of the pieces more than once I
beg you to accept my thankful acknowledgments and to present my
respects to the author

I shall take care to forward the letters to America and shall be glad
of any other opportunity of doing what may be agreeable to you being
with great respect for your characterYour most obedient humble
servant

TO JOSEPH PRIESTLEY

                                  Passy near Paris June  

DEAR SIR

I received your kind Letter of the th of April also one of the d of
May I have always great Pleasure in hearing from you in learning that
you are well and that you continue your Experiments I should rejoice
much if I could once more recover the Leisure to search with you into
the Works of Nature I mean the inanimate not the animate or moral
part of them the more I discoverd of the former the more I admird
them the more I know of the latter the more I am disgusted with them
Men I find to be a Sort of Beings very badly constructed as they are
generally more easily provokd than reconcild more disposed to do
Mischief to each other than to make Reparation much more easily
deceivd than undeceivd and having more Pride and even Pleasure in
killing than in begetting one another for without a Blush they assemble
in great armies at NoonDay to destroy and when they have killd as many
as they can they exaggerate the Number to augment the fancied Glory
but they creep into Corners or cover themselves with the Darkness of
night when they mean to beget as being ashamd of a virtuous Action A
virtuous Action it would be and a vicious one the killing of them if
the Species were really worth producing or preserving but of this I
begin to doubt

I know you have no such Doubts because in your zeal for their welfare
you are taking a great deal of pains to save their Souls Perhaps as you
grow older you may look upon this as a hopeless Project or an idle
Amusement repent of having murdered in mephitic air so many honest
harmless mice and wish that to prevent mischief you had used Boys and
Girls instead of them In what Light we are viewed by superior Beings
may be gathered from a Piece of late West India News which possibly has
not yet reached you A young Angel of Distinction being sent down to
this world on some Business for the first time had an old
courierspirit assigned him as a Guide They arrivd over the Seas of
Martinico in the middle of the long Day of obstinate Fight between the
Fleets of Rodney and De Grasse When thro the Clouds of smoke he saw
the Fire of the Guns the Decks covered with mangled Limbs and Bodies
dead or dying the ships sinking burning or blown into the Air and
the Quantity of Pain Misery and Destruction the Crews yet alive were
thus with so much Eagerness dealing round to one another he turnd
angrily to his Guide and said You blundering Blockhead you are
ignorant of your Business you undertook to conduct me to the Earth
and you have brought me into Hell No Sir says the Guide I have
made no mistake this is really the Earth and these are men Devils
never treat one another in this cruel manner they have more Sense and
more of what Men vainly call Humanity

But to be serious my dear old Friend I love you as much as ever and I
love all the honest Souls that meet at the London Coffee House I only
wonder how it happend that they and my other Friends in England came
to be such good Creatures in the midst of so perverse a Generation I
long to see them and you once more and I labour for Peace with more
Earnestness that I may again be happy in your sweet society

I showd your letter to the Duke de Larochefoucault who thinks with me
the new Experiments you have made are extremely curious and he has
given me thereupon a Note which I inclose and I request you would
furnish me with the answer desired

Yesterday the Count du Nord was at the Academy of Sciences when sundry
Experiments were exhibited for his Entertainment among them one by M
Lavoisier to show that the strongest Fire we yet know is made in a
Charcoal blown upon with dephlogisticated air In a Heat so produced he
melted Platina presently the Fire being much more powerful than that of

TO JONATHAN SHIPLEY

                                            Passy June  

I received and read the Letter from my dear and much respected Friend
with infinite Pleasure After so long a Silence and the long
Continuance of its unfortunate Causes a Line from you was a Prognostic
of happier Times approaching when we may converse and communicate
freely without Danger from the malevolence of Men enragd by the ill
success of their distracted Projects

I long with you for the Return of Peace on the general Principles of
Humanity The Hope of being able to pass a few more of my last Days
happily in the sweet Conversations and Company I once enjoyd at
Twyford is a particular Motive that adds Strength to the general Wish
and quickens my Industry to procure that best of Blessings After much
Occasion to consider the Folly and Mischiefs of a State of Warfare and
the little or no Advantage obtaind even by those Nations who have
conducted it with the most Success I have been apt to think that there
has never been nor ever will be any such thing as a good War or a
bad Peace

You ask if I still relish my old Studies I relish them but I cannot
pursue them My Time is engrossd unhappily with other Concerns I
requested of the Congress last Year my Discharge from this publick
Station that I might enjoy a little Leisure in the Evening of a long
Life of Business but it was refusd me and I have been obliged to
drudge on a little longer

You are happy as your Years come on in having that dear and most
amiable Family about you Four Daughters how rich I have but one and
she necessarily detaind from me at  leagues distance I feel the
Want of that tender Care of me which might be expected from a Daughter
and would give the World for one Your Shades are all placd in a Row
over my Fireplace so that I not only have you always in my Mind but
constantly before my Eyes

The Cause of Liberty and America has been greatly obligd to you I hope
you will live long to see that Country flourish under its new
Constitution which I am sure will give you great Pleasure Will you
permit me to express another Hope that now your Friends are in Power
they will take the first Opportunity of showing the sense they ought to
have of your Virtues and your Merit

Please to make my best Respects acceptable to Mrs Shipley and embrace
for me tenderly all our dear Children With the utmost Esteem Respect
and Veneration I am ever my dear Friend yours most affectionately

TO JAMES HUTTON

                                             Passy July  

MY OLD AND DEAR FRIEND

A Letter written by you to M Berlin Ministre dEtat containing
an Account of the abominable Murders committed by some of the frontier
People on the poor Moravian Indians has given me infinite Pain and
Vexation The Dispensations of Providence in this World puzzle my weak
Reason I cannot comprehend why cruel Men should have been permitted
thus to destroy their Fellow Creatures Some of the Indians may be
supposd to have committed Sins but one cannot think the little
Children had committed any worthy of Death Why has a single Man in
England who happens to love Blood and to hate Americans been permitted
to gratify that bad Temper by hiring German Murderers and joining them
with his own to destroy in a continued Course of bloody Years near
 human Creatures many of them possessed of useful Talents
Virtues and Abilities to which he has no Pretension It is he who has
furnished the Savages with Hatchets and Scalping Knives and engages
them to fall upon our defenceless Farmers and murder them with their
Wives and Children paying for their Scalps of which the account kept
in America already amounts as I have heard to near two Thousand

Perhaps the people of the frontiers exasperated by the Cruelties of the
Indians have been induced to kill all Indians that fall into their
Hands without Distinction so that even these horrid Murders of our poor
Moravians may be laid to his Charge And yet this Man lives enjoys all
the good Things this World can afford and is surrounded by Flatterers
who keep even his Conscience quiet by telling him he is the best of
Princes I wonder at this but I cannot therefore part with the
comfortable Belief of a Divine Providence and the more I see the
Impossibility from the number  extent of his Crimes of giving
equivalent Punishment to a wicked Man in this Life the more I am
convincd of a future State in which all that here appears to be wrong
shall be set right all that is crooked made straight In this Faith
let you  I my dear Friend comfort ourselves it is the only Comfort
in the present dark Scene of Things that is allowd us

I shall not fail to write to the Government of America urging that
effectual Care may be taken to protect  save the Remainder of those
unhappy People

Since writing the above I have received a Philadelphia Paper
containing some Account of the same horrid Transaction a little
different and some Circumstances alledged as Excuses or Palliations
but extreamly weak  insufficient I send it to you inclosd With great
and sincere Esteem I am ever my dear Friend yours most
affectionately

TO SIR JOSEPH BANKS

                                            Passy Sept  

DEAR SIR

I have just received the very kind friendly Letter you were so good as
to write to me by Dr Broussonnet Be assured that I long
earnestly for a Return of those peaceful Times when I could sit down in
sweet Society with my English philosophic Friends communicating to each
other new Discoveries and proposing Improvements of old ones all
tending to extend the Power of Man over Matter avert or diminish the
Evils he is subject to or augment the Number of his Enjoyments Much
more happy should I be thus employd in your most desirable Company
than in that of all the Grandees of the Earth projecting Plans of
Mischief however necessary they may be supposed for obtaining greater
Good

I am glad to learn by the Dr that your great Work goes on I admire
your Magnanimity in the Undertaking and the Perseverance with which you
have prosecuted it

I join with you most perfectly in the charming Wish you so well express
that such Measures may be taken by both Parties as may tend to the
Elevation of both rather than the Destruction of either If any thing
has happened endangering one of them my Comfort is that I endeavourd
earnestly to prevent it and gave honest faithful Advice which if it
had been regarded would have been effectual And still if proper Means
are usd to produce not only a Peace but what is much more
interesting a thorough Reconciliation a few Years may heal the Wounds
that have been made in our Happiness and produce a Degree of Prosperity
of which at present we can hardly form a Conception With great and
sincere Esteem and Respect I am dear Sir c

INFORMATION TO THOSE WHO WOULD REMOVE TO AMERICA



Many Persons in Europe having directly or by Letters expressd to the
Writer of this who is well acquainted with North America their Desire
of transporting and establishing themselves in that Country but who
appear to have formed thro Ignorance mistaken Ideas and Expectations
of what is to be obtained there he thinks it may be useful and prevent
inconvenient expensive and fruitless Removals and Voyages of improper
Persons if he gives some clearer and truer Notions of that part of the
World than appear to have hitherto prevailed

He finds it is imagined by Numbers that the Inhabitants of North
America are rich capable of rewarding and disposd to reward all
sorts of Ingenuity that they are at the same time ignorant of all the
Sciences and consequently that Strangers possessing Talents in the
BellesLettres fine Arts c must be highly esteemed and so well
paid as to become easily rich themselves that there are also abundance
of profitable Offices to be disposed of which the Natives are not
qualified to fill and that having few Persons of Family among them
Strangers of Birth must be greatly respected and of course easily
obtain the best of those Offices which will make all their Fortunes
that the Governments too to encourage Emigrations from Europe not
only pay the Expence of personal Transportation but give Lands gratis
to Strangers with Negroes to work for them Utensils of Husbandry and
Stocks of Cattle These are all wild Imaginations and those who go to
America with Expectations founded upon them will surely find themselves
disappointed

The Truth is that though there are in that Country few People so
miserable as the Poor of Europe there are also very few that in Europe
would be called rich it is rather a general happy Mediocrity that
prevails There are few great Proprietors of the Soil and few Tenants
most People cultivate their own Lands or follow some Handicraft or
Merchandise very few rich enough to live idly upon their Rents or
Incomes or to pay the high Prices given in Europe for Paintings
Statues Architecture and the other Works of Art that are more curious
than useful Hence the natural Geniuses that have arisen in America
with such Talents have uniformly quitted that Country for Europe where
they can be more suitably rewarded It is true that Letters and
Mathematical Knowledge are in Esteem there but they are at the same
time more common than is apprehended there being already existing nine
Colleges or Universities viz four in New England and one in each of
the Provinces of New York New Jersey Pensilvania Maryland and
Virginia all furnishd with learned Professors besides a number of
smaller Academies these educate many of their Youth in the Languages
and those Sciences that qualify men for the Professions of Divinity
Law or Physick Strangers indeed are by no means excluded from
exercising those Professions and the quick Increase of Inhabitants
everywhere gives them a Chance of Employ which they have in common with
the Natives Of civil Offices or Employments there are few no
superfluous Ones as in Europe and it is a Rule establishd in some of
the States that no Office should be so profitable as to make it
desirable The th Article of the Constitution of Pennsilvania runs
expressly in these Words As every Freeman to preserve his
Independence if he has not a sufficient Estate ought to have some
Profession Calling Trade or Farm whereby he may honestly subsist
there can be no Necessity for nor Use in establishing Offices of
Profit the usual Effects of which are Dependance and Servility
unbecoming Freemen in the Possessors and Expectants Faction
Contention Corruption and Disorder among the People Wherefore
whenever an Office thro Increase of Fees or otherwise becomes so
profitable as to occasion many to apply for it the Profits ought to be
lessened by the Legislature

These Ideas prevailing more or less in all the United States it cannot
be worth any Mans while who has a means of Living at home to
expatriate himself in hopes of obtaining a profitable civil Office in
America and as to military Offices they are at an End with the War
the Armies being disbanded Much less is it adviseable for a Person to
go thither who has no other Quality to recommend him but his Birth In
Europe it has indeed its Value but it is a Commodity that cannot be
carried to a worse Market than that of America where people do not
inquire concerning a Stranger What is he but What can he do If
he has any useful Art he is welcome and if he exercises it and
behaves well he will be respected by all that know him but a mere Man
of Quality who on that Account wants to live upon the Public by some
Office or Salary will be despisd and disregarded The Husbandman is in
honor there and even the Mechanic because their Employments are
useful The People have a saying that God Almighty is himself a
Mechanic the greatest in the Universe and he is respected and admired
more for the Variety Ingenuity and Utility of his Handyworks than for
the Antiquity of his Family They are pleasd with the Observation of a
Negro and frequently mention it that Boccarorra meaning the White
men make de black man workee make de Horse workee make de Ox workee
make ebery ting workee only de Hog He de hog no workee he eat he
drink he walk about he go to sleep when he please he libb like a
Gentleman According to these Opinions of the Americans one of them
would think himself more obligd to a Genealogist who could prove for
him that his Ancestors and Relations for ten Generations had been
Ploughmen Smiths Carpenters Turners Weavers Tanners or even
Shoemakers and consequently that they were useful Members of Society
than if he could only prove that they were Gentlemen doing nothing of
Value but living idly on the Labour of others mere fruges consumere
natiL and otherwise good for nothing till by their Death their
Estates like the Carcass of the Negros GentlemanHog come to be cut
up

  L  born merely to eat up the cornWATTS Franklins note

With regard to Encouragements for Strangers from Government they are
really only what are derived from good Laws and Liberty Strangers are
welcome because there is room enough for them all and therefore the
old Inhabitants are not jealous of them the Laws protect them
sufficiently so that they have no need of the Patronage of Great Men
and every one will enjoy securely the Profits of his Industry But if
he does not bring a Fortune with him he must work and be industrious to
live One or two Years residence gives him all the Rights of a Citizen
but the government does not at present whatever it may have done in
former times hire People to become Settlers by Paying their Passages
giving Land Negroes Utensils Stock or any other kind of Emolument
whatsoever In short America is the Land of Labour and by no means
what the English call Lubberland and the French Pays de Cocagne
where the streets are said to be pavd with halfpeck Loaves the Houses
tild with Pancakes and where the Fowls fly about ready roasted
crying Come eat me

Who then are the kind of Persons to whom an Emigration to America may be
advantageous And what are the Advantages they may reasonably expect

Land being cheap in that Country from the vast Forests still void of
Inhabitants and not likely to be occupied in an Age to come insomuch
that the Propriety of an hundred Acres of fertile Soil full of Wood may
be obtained near the Frontiers in many Places for Eight or Ten
Guineas hearty young Labouring Men who understand the Husbandry of
Corn and Cattle which is nearly the same in that Country as in Europe
may easily establish themselves there A little Money savd of the good
Wages they receive there while they work for others enables them to
buy the Land and begin their Plantation in which they are assisted by
the GoodWill of their Neighbours and some Credit Multitudes of poor
People from England Ireland Scotland and Germany have by this means
in a few years become wealthy Farmers who in their own Countries
where all the Lands are fully occupied and the Wages of Labour low
could never have emerged from the poor Condition wherein they were born

From the salubrity of the Air the healthiness of the Climate the
plenty of good Provisions and the Encouragement to early Marriages by
the certainty of Subsistence in cultivating the Earth the Increase of
Inhabitants by natural Generation is very rapid in America and becomes
still more so by the Accession of Strangers hence there is a continual
Demand for more Artisans of all the necessary and useful kinds to
supply those Cultivators of the Earth with Houses and with Furniture
and Utensils of the grosser sorts which cannot so well be brought from
Europe Tolerably good Workmen in any of those mechanic Arts are sure to
find Employ and to be well paid for their Work there being no
Restraints preventing Strangers from exercising any Art they understand
nor any Permission necessary If they are poor they begin first as
Servants or Journeymen and if they are sober industrious and frugal
they soon become Masters establish themselves in Business marry raise
Families and become respectable Citizens

Also Persons of moderate Fortunes and Capitals who having a Number of
Children to provide for are desirous of bringing them up to Industry
and to secure Estates for their Posterity have Opportunities of doing
it in America which Europe does not afford There they may be taught
and practise profitable mechanic Arts without incurring Disgrace on
that Account but on the contrary acquiring Respect by such Abilities
There small Capitals laid out in Lands which daily become more valuable
by the Increase of People afford a solid Prospect of ample Fortunes
thereafter for those Children The writer of this has known several
Instances of large Tracts of Land bought on what was then the
Frontier of Pensilvania for Ten Pounds per hundred Acres which after
 years when the Settlements had been extended far beyond them sold
readily without any Improvement made upon them for three Pounds per
Acre The Acre in America is the same with the English Acre or the Acre
of Normandy

Those who desire to understand the State of Government in America
would do well to read the Constitutions of the several States and the
Articles of Confederation that bind the whole together for general
Purposes under the Direction of one Assembly called the Congress
These Constitutions have been printed by order of Congress in America
two Editions of them have also been printed in London and a good
Translation of them into French has lately been published at Paris

Several of the Princes of Europe having of late years from an Opinion
of Advantage to arise by producing all Commodities and Manufactures
within their own Dominions so as to diminish or render useless their
Importations have endeavoured to entice Workmen from other Countries by
high Salaries Privileges c Many Persons pretending to be skilled in
various great Manufactures imagining that America must be in Want of
them and that the Congress would probably be disposd to imitate the
Princes above mentioned have proposed to go over on Condition of
having their Passages paid Lands given Salaries appointed exclusive
Privileges for Terms of years c Such Persons on reading the Articles
of Confederation will find that the Congress have no Power committed
to them or Money put into their Hands for such purposes and that if
any such Encouragement is given it must be by the Government of some
separate State This however has rarely been done in America and
when it has been done it has rarely succeeded so as to establish a
Manufacture which the Country was not yet so ripe for as to encourage
private Persons to set it up Labour being generally too dear there and
Hands difficult to be kept together every one desiring to be a Master
and the Cheapness of Lands inclining many to leave Trades for
Agriculture Some indeed have met with Success and are carried on to
Advantage but they are generally such as require only a few Hands or
wherein great Part of the Work is performed by Machines Things that are
bulky and of so small Value as not well to bear the Expence of Freight
may often be made cheaper in the Country than they can be imported and
the Manufacture of such Things will be profitable wherever there is a
sufficient Demand The Farmers in America produce indeed a good deal of
Wool and Flax and none is exported it is all workd up but it is in
the Way of domestic Manufacture for the Use of the Family The buying
up Quantities of Wool and Flax with the Design to employ Spinners
Weavers c and form great Establishments producing Quantities of
Linen and Woollen Goods for Sale has been several times attempted in
different Provinces but those Projects have generally failed goods of
equal Value being imported cheaper And when the Governments have been
solicited to support such Schemes by Encouragements in Money or by
imposing Duties on Importation of such Goods it has been generally
refused on this Principle that if the Country is ripe for the
Manufacture it may be carried on by private Persons to Advantage and
if not it is a Folly to think of forcing Nature Great Establishments
of Manufacture require great Numbers of Poor to do the Work for small
Wages these Poor are to be found in Europe but will not be found in
America till the Lands are all taken up and cultivated and the Excess
of People who cannot get Land want Employment The Manufacture of
Silk they say is natural in France as that of Cloth in England
because each Country produces in Plenty the first Material but if
England will have a Manufacture of Silk as well as that of Cloth and
France one of Cloth as well as that of Silk these unnatural Operations
must be supported by mutual Prohibitions or high Duties on the
Importation of each others Goods by which means the Workmen are
enabled to tax the home Consumer by greater Prices while the higher
Wages they receive makes them neither happier nor richer since they
only drink more and work less Therefore the Governments in America do
nothing to encourage such Projects The People by this Means are not
imposd on either by the Merchant or Mechanic If the Merchant demands
too much Profit on imported Shoes they buy of the Shoemaker and if he
asks too high a Price they take them of the Merchant thus the two
Professions are checks on each other The Shoemaker however has on
the whole a considerable Profit upon his Labour in America beyond what
he had in Europe as he can add to his Price a Sum nearly equal to all
the Expences of Freight and Commission Risque or Insurance c
necessarily charged by the Merchant And the Case is the same with the
Workmen in every other Mechanic Art Hence it is that Artisans
generally live better and more easily in America than in Europe and
such as are good conomists make a comfortable Provision for Age and
for their Children Such may therefore remove with Advantage to
America

In the longsettled Countries of Europe all Arts Trades Professions
Farms c are so full that it is difficult for a poor Man who has
Children to place them where they may gain or learn to gain a decent
Livelihood The Artisans who fear creating future Rivals in Business
refuse to take Apprentices but upon Conditions of Money Maintenance
or the like which the Parents are unable to comply with Hence the
Youth are draggd up in Ignorance of every gainful Art and obligd to
become Soldiers or Servants or Thieves for a Subsistence In America
the rapid Increase of Inhabitants takes away that Fear of Rivalship and
Artisans willingly receive Apprentices from the hope of Profit by their
Labour during the Remainder of the Time stipulated after they shall be
instructed Hence it is easy for poor Families to get their Children
instructed for the Artisans are so desirous of Apprentices that many
of them will even give Money to the Parents to have Boys from Ten to
Fifteen Years of Age bound Apprentices to them till the Age of
Twentyone and many poor Parents have by that means on their Arrival
in the Country raised Money enough to buy Land sufficient to establish
themselves and to subsist the rest of their Family by Agriculture
These Contracts for Apprentices are made before a Magistrate who
regulates the Agreement according to Reason and Justice and having in
view the Formation of a future useful Citizen obliges the Master to
engage by a written Indenture not only that during the time of Service
stipulated the Apprentice shall be duly provided with Meat Drink
Apparel washing and Lodging and at its Expiration with a compleat
new Suit of Cloaths but also that he shall be taught to read write
and cast Accompts and that he shall be well instructed in the Art or
Profession of his Master or some other by which he may afterwards gain
a Livelihood and be able in his turn to raise a Family A Copy of this
Indenture is given to the Apprentice or his Friends and the Magistrate
keeps a Record of it to which recourse may be had in case of Failure
by the Master in any Point of Performance This desire among the
Masters to have more Hands employd in working for them induces them
to pay the Passages of young Persons of both Sexes who on their
Arrival agree to serve them one two three or four Years those who
have already learnt a Trade agreeing for a shorter Term in proportion
to their Skill and the consequent immediate Value of their Service and
those who have none agreeing for a longer Term in consideration of
being taught an Art their Poverty would not permit them to acquire in
their own Country

The almost general Mediocrity of Fortune that prevails in America
obliging its People to follow some Business for subsistence those
Vices that arise usually from Idleness are in a great measure
prevented Industry and constant Employment are great preservatives of
the Morals and Virtue of a Nation Hence bad Examples to Youth are more
rare in America which must be a comfortable Consideration to Parents
To this may be truly added that serious Religion under its various
Denominations is not only tolerated but respected and practised
Atheism is unknown there Infidelity rare and secret so that persons
may live to a great Age in that Country without having their Piety
shocked by meeting with either an Atheist or an Infidel And the Divine
Being seems to have manifested his Approbation of the mutual Forbearance
and Kindness with which the different Sects treat each other by the
remarkable Prosperity with which He has been pleased to favour the whole
Country



APOLOGUE



Lion king of a certain forest had among his subjects a body of
faithful dogs in principle and affection strongly attached to his
person and government but through whose assistance he had extended his
dominions and had become the terror of his enemies

Lion however influenced by evil counsellors took an aversion to the
dogs condemned them unheard and ordered his tigers leopards and
panthers to attack and destroy them

The dogs petitioned humbly but their petitions were rejected haughtily
and they were forced to defend themselves which they did with bravery

A few among them of a mongrel race derived from a mixture with wolves
and foxes corrupted by royal promises of great rewards deserted the
honest dogs and joined their enemies

The dogs were finally victorious a treaty of peace was made in which
Lion acknowledged them to be free and disclaimed all future authority
over them

The mongrels not being permitted to return among them claimed of the
royalists the reward that had been promised

A council of the beasts was held to consider their demand

The wolves and the foxes agreed unanimously that the demand was just
that royal promises ought to be kept and that every loyal subject
should contribute freely to enable his majesty to fulfil them

The horse alone with a boldness and freedom that became the nobleness
of his nature delivered a contrary opinion

    The King said he has been misled by bad ministers to
    war unjustly upon his faithful subjects Royal promises when
    made to encourage us to act for the public good should
    indeed be honourably acquitted but if to encourage us to
    betray and destroy each other they are wicked and void from
    the beginning The advisers of such promises and those who
    murdered in consequence of them instead of being
    recompensed should be severely punished Consider how
    greatly our common strength is already diminished by our loss
    of the dogs If you enable the King to reward those
    fratricides you will establish a precedent that may justify
    a future tyrant to make like promises and every example of
    such an unnatural brute rewarded will give them additional
    weight Horses and bulls as well as dogs may thus be
    divided against their own kind and civil wars produced at
    pleasure till we are so weakened that neither liberty nor
    safety is any longer to be found in the forest and nothing
    remains but abject submission to the will of a despot who
    may devour us as he pleases

The council had sense enough to resolvethat the demand be rejected



TO SIR JOSEPH BANKS

                                            Passy July  

DEAR SIR

I received your very kind letter by Dr Blagden and esteem myself
much honoured by your friendly Remembrance I have been too much and too
closely engaged in public Affairs since his being here to enjoy all
the Benefit of his Conversation you were so good as to intend me I hope
soon to have more Leisure and to spend a part of it in those Studies
that are much more agreable to me than political Operations

I join with you most cordially in rejoicing at the return of Peace I
hope it will be lasting and that Mankind will at length as they call
themselves reasonable Creatures have Reason and Sense enough to settle
their Differences without cutting Throats for in my opinion there
never was a good War or a bad Peace What vast additions to the
Conveniences and Comforts of Living might Mankind have acquired if the
Money spent in Wars had been employed in Works of public utility What
an extension of Agriculture even to the Tops of our Mountains what
Rivers rendered navigable or joined by Canals what Bridges Aqueducts
new Roads and other public Works Edifices and Improvements rendering
England a compleat Paradise might have been obtained by spending those
Millions in doing good which in the last War have been spent in doing
Mischief in bringing Misery into thousands of Families and destroying
the Lives of so many thousands of working people who might have
performed the useful labour

I am pleased with the late astronomical Discoveries made by our Society
the RoyalEds Furnished as all Europe now is with Academies of
Science with nice Instruments and the Spirit of Experiment the
progress of human knowledge will be rapid and discoveries made of
which we have at present no Conception I begin to be almost sorry I was
born so soon since I cannot have the happiness of knowing what will be
known  years hence

I wish continued success to the Labours of the Royal Society and that
you may long adorn their Chair being with the highest esteem dear

sent up into the Air much talked of here and which if prosecuted may
furnish means of new knowledge



TO MRS SARAH BACHE

                                            Passy Jan  

MY DEAR CHILD

Your Care in sending me the Newspapers is very agreable to me I
received by Capt Barney those relating to the Cincinnati My Opinion
of the Institution cannot be of much Importance I only wonder that
when the united Wisdom of our Nation had in the Articles of
Confederation manifested their Dislike of establishing Ranks of
Nobility by Authority either of the Congress or of any particular
State a Number of private Persons should think proper to distinguish
themselves and their Posterity from their fellow Citizens and form an
Order of hereditary Knights in direct Opposition to the solemnly
declared Sense of their Country I imagine it must be likewise contrary
to the Good Sense of most of those drawn into it by the Persuasion of
its Projectors who have been too much struck with the Ribbands and
Crosses they have seen among them hanging to the Buttonholes of Foreign
Officers And I suppose those who disapprove of it have not hitherto
given it much Opposition from a Principle somewhat like that of your
good Mother relating to punctilious Persons who are always exacting
little Observances of Respect that if People can be pleased with
small Matters it is a pity but they should have them

In this View perhaps I should not myself if my Advice had been askd
have objected to their wearing their Ribband and Badge according to
their Fancy tho I certainly should to the entailing it as an Honour on
their Posterity For Honour worthily obtaind as for Example that of
our Officers is in its Nature a personal Thing and incommunicable
to any but those who had some Share in obtaining it Thus among the
Chinese the most ancient and from long Experience the wisest of
Nations honour does not descend but ascends If a man from his
Learning his Wisdom or his Valour is promoted by the Emperor to the
Rank of Mandarin his Parents are immediately entitled to all the same
Ceremonies of Respect from the People that are establishd as due to
the Mandarin himself on the supposition that it must have been owing to
the Education Instruction and good Example afforded him by his
Parents that he was rendered capable of serving the Publick

This ascending Honour is therefore useful to the State as it
encourages Parents to give their Children a good and virtuous Education
But the descending Honour to Posterity who could have no Share in
obtaining it is not only groundless and absurd but often hurtful to
that Posterity since it is apt to make them proud disdaining to be
employd in useful Arts and thence falling into Poverty and all the
Meannesses Servility and Wretchedness attending it which is the
present case with much of what is called the Noblesse in Europe Or
if to keep up the Dignity of the Family Estates are entailed entire on
the Eldest male heir another Pest to Industry and Improvement of the
Country is introducd which will be followed by all the odious mixture
of pride and Beggary and idleness that have half depopulated and
decultivated Spain occasioning continual Extinction of Families by
the Discouragements of Marriage and neglect in the improvement of
estates

I wish therefore that the Cincinnati if they must go on with their
Project would direct the Badges of their Order to be worn by their
Parents instead of handing them down to their Children It would be a
good Precedent and might have good Effects It would also be a kind of
Obedience to the Fourth Commandment in which God enjoins us to honour
our Father and Mother but has nowhere directed us to honour our
Children And certainly no mode of honouring those immediate Authors of
our Being can be more effectual than that of doing praiseworthy
Actions which reflect Honour on those who gave us our Education or
more becoming than that of manifesting by some public Expression or
Token that it is to their Instruction and Example we ascribe the Merit
of those Actions

But the Absurdity of descending Honours is not a mere Matter of
philosophical Opinion it is capable of mathematical Demonstration A
Mans Son for instance is but half of his Family the other half
belonging to the Family of his Wife His Son too marrying into another
Family his Share in the Grandson is but a fourth in the Great
Grandson by the same Process it is but an Eighth in the next
Generation a Sixteenth the next a Thirtysecond the next a
Sixtyfourth the next an Hundred and twentyeighth the next a Two
hundred and Fiftysixth and the next a Five hundred and twelfth thus
in nine Generations which will not require more than  years no very
great Antiquity for a Family our present Chevalier of the Order of
Cincinnatuss Share in the then existing Knight will be but a th
part which allowing the present certain Fidelity of American Wives to
be insurd down through all those Nine Generations is so small a
Consideration that methinks no reasonable Man would hazard for the sake
of it the disagreable Consequences of the Jealousy Envy and Ill will
of his Countrymen

Let us go back with our Calculation from this young Noble the th
part of the present Knight thro his nine Generations till we return
to the year of the Institution He must have had a Father and Mother
they are two Each of them had a father and Mother they are four Those
of the next preceding Generation will be eight the next Sixteen the
next thirtytwo the next sixtyfour the next One hundred and
Twentyeight the next Two hundred and fiftysix and the ninth in this
Retrocession Five hundred and twelve who must be now existing and all
contribute their Proportion of this future Chevalier de Cincinnatus
These with the rest make together as follows

                 
                 
                 
                
                
                
               
               
               
              
      Total   

One Thousand and Twentytwo Men and Women contributors to the formation
of one Knight And if we are to have a Thousand of these future
knights there must be now and hereafter existing One million and
Twentytwo Thousand Fathers and Mothers who are to contribute to their
Production unless a Part of the Number are employd in making more
Knights than One Let us strike off then the  on the Supposition
of this double Employ and then consider whether after a reasonable
Estimation of the Number of Rogues and Fools and Royalists and
Scoundrels and Prostitutes that are mixd with and help to make up
necessarily their Million of Predecessors Posterity will have much
reason to boast of the noble Blood of the then existing Set of
Chevaliers de Cincinnatus The future genealogists too of these
Chevaliers in proving the lineal descent of their honour through so
many generations even supposing honour capable in its nature of
descending will only prove the small share of this honour which can
be justly claimed by any one of them since the above simple process in
arithmetic makes it quite plain and clear that in proportion as the
antiquity of the family shall augment the right to the honour of the
ancestor will diminish and a few generations more would reduce it to
something so small as to be very near an absolute nullity I hope
therefore that the Order will drop this part of their project and
content themselves as the Knights of the Garter Bath Thistle St
Louis and other Orders of Europe do with a Life Enjoyment of their
little Badge and Ribband and let the Distinction die with those who
have merited it This I imagine will give no offence For my own part I
shall think it a Convenience when I go into a Company where there may
be Faces unknown to me if I discover by this Badge the Persons who
merit some particular Expression of my Respect and it will save modest
Virtue the Trouble of calling for our Regard by awkward roundabout
Intimations of having been heretofore employd in the Continental
Service

The Gentleman who made the Voyage to France to provide the Ribands and
Medals has executed his Commission To me they seem tolerably done but
all such Things are criticisd Some find Fault with the Latin as
wanting classic Elegance and Correctness and since our Nine
Universities were not able to furnish better Latin it was pity they
say that the Mottos had not been in English Others object to the
Title as not properly assumable by any but Gen Washington and a few
others who servd without Pay Others object to the Bald Eagle as
looking too much like a Dindon or Turkey For my own part I wish the
Bald Eagle had not been chosen as the Representative of our Country he
is a Bird of bad moral Character he does not get his living honestly
you may have seen him perchd on some dead Tree near the River where
too lazy to fish for himself he watches the Labour of the FishingHawk
and when that diligent Bird has at length taken a Fish and is bearing
it to his Nest for the support of his Mate and young ones the Bald
Eagle pursues him and takes it from him With all this Injustice he is
never in good Case but like those among Men who live by Sharping and
Robbing he is generally poor and often very lousy Besides he is a
rank Coward the little King Bird not bigger than a sparrow attacks
him boldly and drives him out of the District He is therefore by no
means a proper emblem for the brave and honest Cincinnati of America
who have driven all the Kingbirds from our Country though exactly fit
for that Order of Knights which the French call Chevaliers
dIndustrie

I am on this account not displeasd that the Figure is not known as a
Bald Eagle but looks more like a Turky For in Truth the Turky is in
comparison a much more respectable Bird and withal a true original
Native of America Eagles have been found in all Countries but the
Turky was peculiar to ours the first of the Species seen in Europe
being brought to France by the Jesuits from Canada and servd up at the
Wedding Table of Charles the Ninth He is though a little vain and
silly it is true but not the worse emblem for that a Bird of
Courage and would not hesitate to attack a Grenadier of the British
Guards who should presume to invade his Farm Yard with a red Coat on

I shall not enter into the Criticisms made upon their Latin The gallant
officers of America may not have the merit of being be no great
scholars but they undoubtedly merit much as brave soldiers from
their Country which should therefore not leave them merely to Fame
for their Virtutis Premium which is one of their Latin Mottos
Their Esto perpetua another is an excellent Wish if they meant it
for their Country bad if intended for their Order The States should
not only restore to them the Omnia of their first Motto which many of
them have left and lost but pay them justly and reward them
generously They should not be suffered to remain with all their
newcreated Chivalry entirely in the Situation of the Gentleman in
the Story which their omnia reliquit reminds me of You know every
thing makes me recollect some Story He had built a very fine House and
thereby much impaird his Fortune He had a Pride however in showing
it to his Acquaintance One of them after viewing it all remarkd a
Motto over the Door IA VANITAS What says he is the Meaning
of this IA it is a word I dont understand I will tell you
said the Gentleman I had a mind to have the Motto cut on a Piece of
smooth Marble but there was not room for it between the Ornaments to
be put in Characters large enough to be read I therefore made use of a
Contraction antiently very common in Latin Manuscripts by which the
ms and ns in Words are omitted and the Omission noted by a little
Dash above which you may see there so that the Word is omnia OMNIA
VANITAS O says his Friend I now comprehend the Meaning of your
motto it relates to your Edifice and signifies that if you have
abridged your Omnia you have nevertheless left your VANITAS legible
at full length I am as ever your affectionate father

AN ECONOMICAL PROJECT

TO THE AUTHORS OF THE JOURNAL OF PARIS

                                           March  

MESSIEURS

You often entertain us with accounts of new discoveries Permit me to
communicate to the public through your paper one that has lately been
made by myself and which I conceive may be of great utility

I was the other evening in a grand company where the new lamp of
Messrs Quinquet and Lange was introduced and much admired for its
splendour but a general inquiry was made whether the oil it consumed
was not in proportion to the light it afforded in which case there
would be no saving in the use of it No one present could satisfy us in
that point which all agreed ought to be known it being a very
desirable thing to lessen if possible the expense of lighting our
apartments when every other article of family expense was so much
augmented

I was pleased to see this general concern for economy for I love
economy exceedingly

I went home and to bed three or four hours after midnight with my
head full of the subject An accidental sudden noise waked me about six
in the morning when I was surprised to find my room filled with light
and I imagined at first that a number of those lamps had been brought
into it but rubbing my eyes I perceived the light came in at the
windows I got up and looked out to see what might be the occasion of
it when I saw the sun just rising above the horizon from whence he
poured his rays plentifully into my chamber my domestic having
negligently omitted the preceding evening to close the shutters

I looked at my watch which goes very well and found that it was but
six oclock and still thinking it something extraordinary that the sun
should rise so early I looked into the almanac where I found it to be
the hour given for his rising on that day I looked forward too and
found he was to rise still earlier every day till towards the end of
June and that at no time in the year he retarded his rising so long as
till eight oclock Your readers who with me have never seen any signs
of sunshine before noon and seldom regard the astronomical part of the
almanac will be as much astonished as I was when they hear of his
rising so early and especially when I assure them that he gives light
as soon as he rises I am convinced of this I am certain of my fact
One cannot be more certain of any fact I saw it with my own eyes And
having repeated this observation the three following mornings I found
always precisely the same result

Yet it so happens that when I speak of this discovery to others I can
easily perceive by their countenances though they forbear expressing it
in words that they do not quite believe me One indeed who is a
learned natural philosopher has assured me that I must certainly be
mistaken as to the circumstance of the light coming into my room for it
being well known as he says that there could be no light abroad at
that hour it follows that none could enter from without and that of
consequence my windows being accidentally left open instead of letting
in the light had only served to let out the darkness and he used many
ingenious arguments to show me how I might by that means have been
deceived I owned that he puzzled me a little but he did not satisfy
me and the subsequent observations I made as above mentioned
confirmed me in my first opinion

This event has given rise in my mind to several serious and important
reflections I considered that if I had not been awakened so early in
the morning I should have slept six hours longer by the light of the
sun and in exchange have lived six hours the following night by
candlelight and the latter being a much more expensive light than the
former my love of economy induced me to muster up what little
arithmetic I was master of and to make some calculations which I shall
give you after observing that utility is in my opinion the test of
value in matters of invention and that a discovery which can be applied
to no use or is not good for something is good for nothing

I took for the basis of my calculation the supposition that there are
one hundred thousand families in Paris and that these families consume
in the night half a pound of bougies or candles per hour I think this
is a moderate allowance taking one family with another for though I
believe some consume less I know that many consume a great deal more
Then estimating seven hours per day as a medium quantity between the
time of the suns rising and ours he rising during the six following
months from six to eight hours before noon and there being seven hours
of course per night in which we burn candles the account will stand
thus

In the six months between the th of March and the th of September
there are

    Nights                                                     
    Hours of each night in which we burn candles                
                                                             
    Multiplication gives for the total number of
      hours                                                  

    These  hours multiplied by  the
    number of inhabitants give                        

    One hundred twentyeight millions and one
      hundred thousand hours spent at Paris by
      candlelight which at half a pound of wax
      and tallow per hour gives the weight of          

    Sixtyfour millions and fifty thousand of pounds
      which estimating the whole at the medium
      price of thirty sols the pound makes the sum
      of ninetysix millions and seventyfive thousand
      livres tournois                                   

An immense sum that the city of Paris might save every year by the
economy of using sunshine instead of candles

If it should be said that people are apt to be obstinately attached to
old customs and that it will be difficult to induce them to rise before
noon consequently my discovery can be of little use I answer Nil
desperandum I believe all who have common sense as soon as they have
learnt from this paper that it is daylight when the sun rises will
contrive to rise with him and to compel the rest I would propose the
following regulations

First Let a tax be laid of a louis per window on every window that is
provided with shutters to keep out the light of the sun

Second Let the same salutary operation of police be made use of to
prevent our burning candles that inclined us last winter to be more
economical in burning wood that is let guards be placed in the shops
of the wax and tallow chandlers and no family be permitted to be
supplied with more than one pound of candles per week

Third Let guards also be posted to stop all the coaches c that would
pass the streets after sunset except those of physicians surgeons
and midwives

Fourth Every morning as soon as the sun rises let all the bells in
every church be set ringing and if that is not sufficient let cannon
be fired in every street to wake the sluggards effectually and make
them open their eyes to see their true interest

All the difficulty will be in the first two or three days after which
the reformation will be as natural and easy as the present irregularity
for ce nest que le premier pas qui cote Oblige a man to rise at
four in the morning and it is more than probable he will go willingly
to bed at eight in the evening and having had eight hours sleep he
will rise more willingly at four in the morning following But this sum
of ninetysix millions and seventyfive thousand livres is not the whole
of what may be saved by my economical project You may observe that I
have calculated upon only one half of the year and much may be saved in
the other though the days are shorter Besides the immense stock of
wax and tallow left unconsumed during the summer will probably make
candles much cheaper for the ensuing winter and continue them cheaper
as long as the proposed reformation shall be supported

For the great benefit of this discovery thus freely communicated and
bestowed by me on the public I demand neither place pension exclusive
privilege nor any other reward whatever I expect only to have the
honour of it And yet I know there are little envious minds who will
as usual deny me this and say that my invention was known to the
ancients and perhaps they may bring passages out of the old books in
proof of it I will not dispute with these people that the ancients
knew not the sun would rise at certain hours they possibly had as we
have almanacs that predicted it but it does not follow thence that
they knew he gave light as soon as he rose This is what I claim as my
discovery If the ancients knew it it might have been long since
forgotten for it certainly was unknown to the moderns at least to the
Parisians which to prove I need use but one plain simple argument
They are as well instructed judicious and prudent a people as exist
anywhere in the world all professing like myself to be lovers of
economy and from the many heavy taxes required from them by the
necessities of the state have surely an abundant reason to be
economical I say it is impossible that so sensible a people under such
circumstances should have lived so long by the smoky unwholesome and
enormously expensive light of candles if they had really known that
they might have had as much pure light of the sun for nothing I am c

TO SAMUEL MATHER

                                             Passy May  

REVD SIR

I received your kind letter with your excellent advice to the people of
the United States which I read with great pleasure and hope it will be
duly regarded Such writings though they may be lightly passed over by
many readers yet if they make a deep impression on one active mind in
a hundred the effects may be considerable Permit me to mention one
little instance which though it relates to myself will not be quite
uninteresting to you When I was a boy I met with a book entitled
Essays to do Good which I think was written by your father It had
been so little regarded by a former possessor that several leaves of it
were torn out but the remainder gave me such a turn of thinking as to
have an influence on my conduct through life for I have always set a
greater value on the character of a doer of good than on any other
kind of reputation and if I have been as you seem to think a useful
citizen the public owes the advantage of it to that book

You mention your being in your th year I am in my th we are
grown old together It is now more than  years since I left Boston
but I remember well both your father and grandfather having heard them
both in the pulpit and seen them in their houses The last time I saw
your father was in the beginning of  when I visited him after my
first trip to Pennsylvania He received me in his library and on my
taking leave showed me a shorter way out of the house through a narrow
passage which was crossed by a beam over head We were still talking as
I withdrew he accompanying me behind and I turning partly towards him
when he said hastily Stoop stoop I did not understand him till I
felt my head hit against the beam He was a man that never missed any
occasion of giving instruction and upon this he said to me You are
young and have the world before you STOOP as you go through it and
you will miss many hard thumps This advice thus beat into my head
has frequently been of use to me and I often think of it when I see
pride mortified and misfortunes brought upon people by their carrying
their heads too high

I long much to see again my native place and to lay my bones there I
left it in  I visited it in    and  In  I
was in England in  I had a sight of it but could not enter it
being in possession of the enemy I did hope to have been there in 
but could not obtain my dismission from this employment here and now I
fear I shall never have that happiness My best wishes however attend my
dear country Esto perpetua It is now blest with an excellent
constitution may it last for ever

This powerful monarchy continues its friendship for the United States
It is a friendship of the utmost importance to our security and should
be carefully cultivated Britain has not yet well digested the loss of
its dominion over us and has still at times some flattering hopes of
recovering it Accidents may increase those hopes and encourage
dangerous attempts A breach between us and France would infallibly
bring the English again upon our backs and yet we have some wild heads
among our countrymen who are endeavouring to weaken that connexion Let
us preserve our reputation by performing our engagements our credit by
fulfilling our contracts and friends by gratitude and kindness for we
know not how soon we may again have occasion for all of them With great
and sincere esteem I have the honour to be c

TO BENJAMIN VAUGHAN

                                          Passy July th 

DEAR FRIEND

I have received several Letters from you lately dated June  June 
and July  I thank you for the Information respecting the Proceedings
of your West India Merchants or rather Planters The Restraints what
ever they may be upon our Commerce with your Islands will prejudice
their Inhabitants I apprehend more than us

It is wonderful how preposterously the affairs of this world are
managed Naturally one would imagine that the interest of a few
individuals should give way to general interest but individuals manage
their affairs with so much more application industry and address than
the public do theirs that general interest most commonly gives way to
particular We assemble parliaments and councils to have the benefit of
their collected wisdom but we necessarily have at the same time the
inconvenience of their collected passions prejudices and private
interest By the help of these artful men overpower their wisdom and
dupe its possessors and if we may judge by the acts arrts and
edicts all the world over for regulating commerce an assembly of
great men is the greatest fool upon earth

I have received Cooks Voyages which you put Mr Oswald in the way of
sending to me By some Mistake the first Volume was omitted and instead
of it a Duplicate sent of the third If there is a good Print of Cook I
should be glad to have it being personally acquainted with him I thank
you for the Pamphlets by Mr Estlin Every thing you send me gives me
Pleasure to receive your Account would give me more than all

I am told that the little Pamphlet of Advice to such as would remove
to America is reprinted in London with my Name to it which I would
rather had been omitted but wish to see a Copy when you have an
Opportunity of sending it

Mr H has long continued here in Expectation of Instructions for making
a Treaty of Commerce but they do not come and I begin to suspect none
are intended tho perhaps the Delay is only occasioned by the over
great Burthen of Business at present on the Shoulders of your Ministers
We do not press the Matter but are content to wait till they can see
their Interest respecting America more clearly being certain that we
can shift as well as you without a Treaty

The Conjectures I sent you concerning the cold of last Winter still
appear to me probable The moderate Season in Russia and Canada do not
weaken them I think our Frost here began about the th of December in
America the  of January I thank you for recommending to me Mr
Arbuthnot I have had Pleasure in his Conversation I wish much to see
the new Pieces you had in hand I congratulate you on the Return of your
Weddingday and wish for your Sake and Mrs Vaughans that you may see
a great many of them all as happy as the first

I like the young stranger very much He seems sensible ingenious and
modest has a good deal of Instruction and makes judicious
Observations He will probably distinguish himself advantageously I
have not yet heard from Mr Nairne

Dr Prices Pamphlet of Advice to America is a good one and will do
Good You ask what Remedy I have for the growing Luxury of my Country
which gives so much Offence to all English travellers without
exception I answer that I think it exaggerated and that Travellers
are no good Judges whether our Luxury is growing or diminishing Our
People are hospitable and have indeed too much Pride in displaying upon
their Tables before Strangers the Plenty and Variety that our Country
affords They have the Vanity too of sometimes borrowing one anothers
Plate to entertain more splendidly Strangers being invited from House
to House and meeting every Day with a Feast imagine what they see is
the ordinary Way of living of all the Families where they dine when
perhaps each Family lives a Week after upon the Remains of the Dinner
given It is I own a Folly in our People to give such Offence to
English Travellers The first part of the Proverb is thereby verified
that Fools make Feasts I wish in this Case the other were as true
and wise Men eat them These Travellers might one would think find
some Fault they could more decently reproach us with than that of our
excessive Civility to them as Strangers

I have not indeed yet thought of a Remedy for Luxury I am not sure
that in a great State it is capable of a Remedy Nor that the Evil is
in itself always so great as it is represented Suppose we include in
the Definition of Luxury all unnecessary Expence and then let us
consider whether Laws to prevent such Expence are possible to be
executed in a great Country and whether if they could be executed our
People generally would be happier or even richer Is not the Hope of
one day being able to purchase and enjoy Luxuries a great Spur to Labour
and Industry May not Luxury therefore produce more than it consumes
if without such a Spur People would be as they are naturally enough
inclined to be lazy and indolent To this purpose I remember a
Circumstance The Skipper of a Shallop employed between Cape May and
Philadelphia had done us some small Service for which he refused Pay
My Wife understanding that he had a Daughter sent her as a Present a
newfashioned Cap Three Years After this Skipper being at my House
with an old Farmer of Cape May his Passenger he mentioned the Cap and
how much his Daughter had been pleased with it But says he it
proved a dear Cap to our Congregation How so When my Daughter
appeared in it at Meeting it was so much admired that all the Girls
resolved to get such Caps from Philadelphia and my Wife and I computed
that the whole could not have cost less than a hundred Pound True
says the Farmer but you do not tell all the Story I think the Cap was
nevertheless an Advantage to us for it was the first thing that put our
Girls upon Knitting worsted Mittens for Sale at Philadelphia that they
might have wherewithal to buy Caps and Ribbands there and you know that
that Industry has continued and is likely to continue and increase to a
much greater Value and answer better Purposes Upon the whole I was
more reconciled to this little Piece of Luxury since not only the Girls
were made happier by having fine Caps but the Philadelphians by the
Supply of warm Mittens

In our Commercial Towns upon the Seacoast Fortunes will occasionally be
made Some of those who grow rich will be prudent live within Bounds
and preserve what they have gained for their Posterity others fond of
showing their Wealth will be extravagant and ruin themselves Laws
cannot prevent this and perhaps it is not always an evil to the
Publick A Shilling spent idly by a Fool may be picked up by a Wiser
Person who knows better what to do with it It is therefore not lost A
vain silly Fellow builds a fine House furnishes it richly lives in it
expensively and in few years ruins himself but the Masons Carpenters
Smiths and other honest Tradesmen have been by his Employ assisted in
maintaining and raising their Families the Farmer has been paid for his
labour and encouraged and the Estate is now in better Hands In some
Cases indeed certain Modes of Luxury may be a publick Evil in the
same Manner as it is a Private one If there be a Nation for Instance
that exports its Beef and Linnen to pay for its Importation of Claret
and Porter while a great Part of its People live upon Potatoes and
wear no Shirts wherein does it differ from the Sot who lets his Family
starve and sells his Clothes to buy Drink Our American Commerce is I
confess a little in this way We sell our Victuals to your Islands for
Rum and Sugar the substantial Necessaries of Life for Superfluities
But we have Plenty and live well nevertheless tho by being soberer
we might be richer

By the by here is just issued an arrt of Council taking off all the
Duties upon the exportation of Brandies which it is said will render
them cheaper in America than your Rum in which case there is no doubt
but they will be preferrd and we shall be better able to bear your
Restrictions on our Commerce There are Views here by augmenting their
Settlements of being able to supply the growing People of America with
the Sugar that may be wanted there On the whole I guess England will
get as little by the Commercial War she has begun with us as she did by
the Military But to return to Luxury

The vast Quantity of Forest Lands we have yet to clear and put in order
for Cultivation will for a long time keep the Body of our Nation
laborious and frugal Forming an Opinion of our People and their Manners
by what is seen among the Inhabitants of the Seaports is judging from
an improper Sample The People of the Trading Towns may be rich and
luxurious while the Country possesses all the Virtues that tend to
private Happiness and publick Prosperity Those Towns are not much
regarded by the Country they are hardly considered as an essential Part
of the States and the Experience of the last War has shown that their
being in the Possession of the Enemy did not necessarily draw on the
Subjection of the Country which bravely continued to maintain its
Freedom and Independence notwithstanding

It has been computed by some Political Arithmetician that if every Man
and Woman would work for four Hours each Day on something useful that
Labour would produce sufficient to procure all the Necessaries and
Comforts of Life Want and Misery would be banished out of the World
and the rest of the  hours might be Leisure and Pleasure

What occasions then so much Want and Misery It is the Employment of Men
and Women in Works that produce neither the Necessaries nor
Conveniences of Life who with those who do nothing consume the
Necessaries raised by the Laborious To explain this

The first Elements of Wealth are obtained by Labour from the Earth and
Waters I have Land and raise Corn With this if I feed a Family that
does nothing my Corn will be consumd and at the end of the Year I
shall be no richer than I was at the beginning But if while I feed
them I employ them some in Spinning others in hewing Timber and
sawing Boards others in making Bricks c for Building the Value of
my Corn will be arrested and remain with me and at the end of the Year
we may all be better clothed and better lodged And if instead of
employing a Man I feed in making Bricks I employ him in fiddling for
me the Corn he eats is gone and no Part of his Manufacture remains to
augment the Wealth and Convenience of the family I shall therefore be
the poorer for this fiddling Man unless the rest of my Family work
more or eat less to make up the Deficiency he occasions

Look round the World and see the Millions employd in doing nothing or
in something that amounts to nothing when the Necessaries and
Conveniences of Life are in question What is the Bulk of Commerce for
which we fight and destroy each other but the Toil of Millions for
Superfluities to the great Hazard and Loss of many Lives by the
constant Dangers of the Sea How much labour is spent in Building and
fitting great Ships to go to China and Arabia for Tea and Coffee to
the West Indies for Sugar to America for Tobacco These things cannot
be called the Necessaries of Life for our Ancestors lived very
comfortably without them

A Question may be asked Could all these People now employed in
raising making or carrying Superfluities be subsisted by raising
Necessaries I think they might The World is large and a great Part of
it still uncultivated Many hundred Millions of Acres in Asia Africa
and America are still Forest and a great Deal even in Europe On 
Acres of this Forest a Man might become a substantial Farmer and
 Men employed in clearing each his  Acres would hardly
brighten a Spot big enough to be Visible from the Moon unless with
Herschells Telescope so vast are the Regions still in Wood unimproved

Tis however some Comfort to reflect that upon the whole the
Quantity of Industry and Prudence among Mankind exceeds the Quantity of
Idleness and Folly Hence the Increase of good Buildings Farms
cultivated and populous Cities filled with Wealth all over Europe
which a few Ages since were only to be found on the Coasts of the
Mediterranean and this notwithstanding the mad Wars continually
raging by which are often destroyed in one year the Works of many
Years Peace So that we may hope the Luxury of a few Merchants on the
Seacoast will not be the Ruin of America

One reflection more and I well end this long rambling Letter Almost
all the Parts of our Bodies require some Expence The Feet demand Shoes
the Legs Stockings the rest of the Body Clothing and the Belly a
good deal of Victuals Our Eyes tho exceedingly useful ask when
reasonable only the cheap Assistance of Spectacles which could not
much impair our Finances But the Eyes of other People are the Eyes
that ruin us If all but myself were blind I should want neither fine
Clothes fine Houses nor fine Furniture Adieu my dear Friend I am

                                            Yours ever

TO GEORGE WHATELY

                                             Passy May  

DEAR OLD FRIEND

 I must agree with you that the Gout is bad and that the Stone is
worse I am happy in not having them both together and I join in your
Prayer that you may live till you die without either But I doubt the
Author of the Epitaph you send me was a little mistaken when he
speaking of the World says that

                          he neer card a pin
    What they said or may say of the Mortal within

It is so natural to wish to be well spoken of whether alive or dead
that I imagine he could not be quite exempt from that Desire and that
at least he wishd to be thought a Wit or he would not have given
himself the Trouble of writing so good an Epitaph to leave behind him
Was it not as worthy of his Care that the World should say he was an
honest and a good Man I like better the concluding Sentiment in the old
Song calld The Old Mans Wish wherein after wishing for a warm
House in a country Town an easy Horse some good old authors ingenious
and cheerful Companions a Pudding on Sundays with stout Ale and a
bottle of Burgundy c c in separate Stanzas each ending with this
burthen

    May I govern my Passions with an absolute sway
     Grow wiser and better as my Strength wears away
     Without Gout or Stone by a gentle Decay

he adds

    With a Courage undaunted may I face my last day
     And when I am gone may the better Sort say
     In the Morning when sober in the Evening when mellow
     Hes gone and has not left behind him his Fellow
         For he governed his Passions c

But what signifies our Wishing Things happen after all as they will
happen I have sung that wishing Song a thousand times when I was
young and now find at Fourscore that the three Contraries have
befallen me being subject to the Gout and the Stone and not being yet
Master of all my Passions Like the proud Girl in my Country who wished
and resolvd not to marry a Parson nor a Presbyterian nor an Irishman
and at length found herself married to an Irish Presbyterian Parson

You see I have some reason to wish that in a future State I may not
only be as well as I was but a little better And I hope it for I
too with your Poet trust in God And when I observe that there is
great Frugality as well as Wisdom in his Works since he has been
evidently sparing both of Labour and Materials for by the various
wonderful Inventions of Propagation he has provided for the continual
peopling his World with Plants and Animals without being at the Trouble
of repeated new Creations and by the natural Reduction of compound
Substances to their original Elements capable of being employd in new
Compositions he has prevented the Necessity of creating new Matter so
that the Earth Water Air and perhaps Fire which being compounded
form Wood do when the Wood is dissolved return and again become Air
Earth Fire and Water I say that when I see nothing annihilated and
not even a Drop of Water wasted I cannot suspect the Annihilation of
Souls or believe that he will suffer the daily Waste of Millions of
Minds ready made that now exist and put himself to the continual
Trouble of making new ones Thus finding myself to exist in the World I
believe I shall in some Shape or other always exist and with all the
inconveniencies human Life is liable to I shall not object to a new
Edition of mine hoping however that the Errata of the last may be
corrected

 Adieu my dear Friend and believe me ever yours very
affectionately

DEAR FRIENDS

I received your kind letter which gave me great pleasure as it
informed me of your welfare Your friendly congratulations are very
obliging I had on my return some right as you observe to expect
repose and it was my intention to avoid all public business But I had
not firmness enough to resist the unanimous desire of my country folks
and I find myself harnessed again in their service for another year
They engrossed the prime of my life They have eaten my flesh and seem
resolved now to pick my bones You are right in supposing that I
interest myself in every thing that affects you and yours sympathizing
in your afflictions and rejoicing in your felicities for our
friendship is ancient and was never obscured by the least cloud

I thank you for your civilities to my grandson and am ever with
sincere and great esteem and regard my dear friends yours most
affectionately

TO JONATHAN SHIPLEY

                                  Philadelphia Feb th 

DEAR FRIEND

I received lately your kind letter of Nov th My Reception here was
as you have heard very honourable indeed but I was betrayd by it and
by some Remains of Ambition from which I had imagined myself free to
accept of the Chair of Government for the State of Pennsylvania when
the proper thing for me was Repose and a private Life I hope however
to be able to bear the Fatigue for one Year and then to retire

I have much regretted our having so little Opportunity for Conversation
when we last met You could have given me Informations and Counsels that
I wanted but we were scarce a Minute together without being broke in
upon I am to thank you however for the Pleasure I had after our
Parting in reading the new Book you gave me which I think
generally well written and likely to do good tho the Reading Time of
most People is of late so taken up with News Papers and little
periodical Pamphlets that few nowadays venture to attempt reading a
Quarto Volume I have admird to see that in the last Century a
Folio Burton on Melancholly went through Six Editions in about
Twenty Years We have I believe more Readers now but not of such
large Books

You seem desirous of knowing what Progress we make here in improving our
Governments We are I think in the right Road of Improvement for we
are making Experiments I do not oppose all that seem wrong for the
Multitude are more effectually set right by Experience than kept from
going wrong by Reasoning with them And I think we are daily more and
more enlightened so that I have no doubt of our obtaining in a few
Years as much public Felicity as good Government is capable of
affording

Your NewsPapers are filld with fictitious Accounts of Anarchy
Confusion Distresses and Miseries we are supposd to be involvd in
as Consequences of the Revolution and the few remaining Friends of the
old Government among us take pains to magnify every little Inconvenience
a Change in the Course of Commerce may have occasiond To obviate the
Complaints they endeavour to excite was written the enclosd little
Piece from which you may form a truer Idea of our Situation than
your own public Prints would give you And I can assure you that the
great Body of our Nation find themselves happy in the Change and have
not the smallest Inclination to return to the Domination of Britain
There could not be a stronger Proof of the general Approbation of the
Measures that promoted the Change and of the Change itself than has
been given by the Assembly and Council of this State in the nearly
unanimous Choice for their Governor of one who had been so much
concernd in those Measures the Assembly being themselves the unbribd
Choice of the People and therefore may be truly supposd of the same
Sentiments I say nearly unanimous because of between  and  Votes
there were only my own and one other in the negative

As to my Domestic Circumstances of which you kindly desire to hear
something they are at present as happy as I could wish them I am
surrounded by my Offspring a Dutiful and Affectionate Daughter in my
House with Six Grandchildren the eldest of which you have seen who is
now at a College in the next Street finishing the learned Part of his
Education the others promising both for Parts and good Dispositions
What their Conduct may be when they grow up and enter the important
Scenes of Life I shall not live to see and I cannot foresee I
therefore enjoy among them the present Hour and leave the future to
Providence

He that raises a large Family does indeed while he lives to observe
them stand as Watts says a broader Mark for Sorrow but then he
stands a broader Mark for Pleasure too When we launch our little Fleet
of Barques into the Ocean bound to different Ports we hope for each a
prosperous Voyage but contrary Winds hidden Shoals Storms and
Enemies come in for a Share in the Disposition of Events and though
these occasion a Mixture of Disappointment yet considering the Risque
where we can make no Insurance we should think ourselves happy if some
return with Success My Sons Son Temple Franklin whom you have also
seen having had a fine Farm of  Acres conveyd to him by his
Father when we were at Southampton has dropd for the present his Views
of acting in the political Line and applies himself ardently to the
Study and Practice of Agriculture This is much more agreable to me who
esteem it the most useful the most independent and therefore the
noblest of Employments His Lands are on navigable water communicating
with the Delaware and but about  Miles from this City He has
associated to himself a very skillful English Farmer lately arrived
here who is to instruct him in the Business and partakes for a Term
of the Profits so that there is a great apparent Probability of their
Success

You will kindly expect a Word or two concerning myself My Health and
Spirits continue Thanks to God as when you saw me The only complaint
I then had does not grow worse and is tolerable I still have
Enjoyment in the Company of my Friends and being easy in my
Circumstances have many Reasons to like Living But the Course of
Nature must soon put a period to my present Mode of Existence This I
shall submit to with less Regret as having seen during a long Life a
good deal of this World I feel a growing Curiosity to be acquainted
with some other and can chearfully with filial Confidence resign my
Spirit to the conduct of that great and good Parent of Mankind who
created it and who has so graciously protected and prospered me from my
Birth to the present Hour Wherever I am I hope always to retain the
pleasing remembrance of your Friendship being with sincere and great
Esteem my dear Friend yours most affectionately

                                                     B FRANKLIN

whole amiable Family

DEAR SIR

I have read your Manuscript with some Attention By the Argument it
contains against the Doctrines of a particular Providence tho you
allow a general Providence you strike at the Foundation of all
Religion For without the Belief of a Providence that takes Cognizance
of guards and guides and may favour particular Persons there is no
Motive to Worship a Deity to fear its Displeasure or to pray for its
Protection I will not enter into any Discussion of your Principles
tho you seem to desire it At present I shall only give you my
Opinion that though your Reasonings are subtile and may prevail with
some Readers you will not succeed so as to change the general
Sentiments of Mankind on that Subject and the Consequence of printing
this Piece will be a great deal of Odium drawn upon yourself Mischief
to you and no Benefit to others He that spits against the Wind spits
in his own Face

But were you to succeed do you imagine any Good would be done by it
You yourself may find it easy to live a virtuous Life without the
Assistance afforded by Religion you having a clear Perception of the
Advantages of Virtue and the Disadvantages of Vice and possessing a
Strength of Resolution sufficient to enable you to resist common
Temptations But think how great a Proportion of Mankind consists of
weak and ignorant Men and Women and of inexperiencd and inconsiderate
Youth of both Sexes who have need of the Motives of Religion to
restrain them from Vice to support their Virtue and retain them in the
Practice of it till it becomes habitual which is the great Point for
its Security And perhaps you are indebted to her originally that is
to your Religious Education for the Habits of Virtue upon which you now
justly value yourself You might easily display your excellent Talents
of reasoning upon a less hazardous subject and thereby obtain a Rank
with our most distinguishd Authors For among us it is not necessary
as among the Hottentots that a Youth to be receivd into the Company
of men should prove his Manhood by beating his Mother

I would advise you therefore not to attempt unchaining the Tyger but
to burn this Piece before it is seen by any other Person whereby you
will save yourself a great deal of Mortification from the Enemies it may
raise against you and perhaps a good deal of Regret and Repentance If
men are so wicked as we now see them with religion what would they be
if without it I intend this Letter itself as a Proof of my
Friendship and therefore add no Professions to it but subscribe
simply yours

SPEECH IN THE CONVENTION ON THE SUBJECT OF SALARIES

Delivered June  

SIR

It is with Reluctance that I rise to express a Disapprobation of any one
Article of the Plan for which we are so much obliged to the honourable
Gentleman who laid it before us From its first Reading I have borne a
good Will to it and in general wishd it Success In this Particular
of Salaries to the Executive Branch I happen to differ and as my
Opinion may appear new and chimerical it is only from a Persuasion that
it is right and from a Sense of Duty that I hazard it The Committee
will judge of my Reasons when they have heard them and their judgment
may possibly change mine I think I see Inconveniences in the
Appointment of Salaries I see none in refusing them but on the
contrary great Advantages

Sir there are two Passions which have a powerful Influence in the
Affairs of Men These are Ambition and Avarice the Love of Power
and the Love of Money Separately each of these has great Force in
prompting Men to Action but when united in View of the same Object
they have in many Minds the most violent Effects Place before the Eyes
of such Men a Post of Honour that shall at the same time be a Place
of Profit and they will move Heaven and Earth to obtain it The vast
Number of such Places it is that renders the British Government so
tempestuous The Struggles for them are the true Source of all those
Factions which are perpetually dividing the Nation distracting its
Councils hurrying it sometimes into fruitless and mischievous Wars and
often compelling a Submission to dishonourable Terms of Peace

And of what kind are the men that will strive for this profitable
Preminence thro all the Bustle of Cabal the Heat of Contention the
infinite mutual Abuse of Parties tearing to Pieces the best of
Characters It will not be the wise and moderate the Lovers of Peace
and good Order the men fittest for the Trust It will be the Bold and
the Violent the men of strong Passions and indefatigable Activity in
their selfish Pursuits These will thrust themselves into your
Government and be your Rulers And these too will be mistaken in the
expected Happiness of their Situation for their vanquishd competitors
of the same Spirit and from the same Motives will perpetually be
endeavouring to distress their Administration thwart their Measures
and render them odious to the People

Besides these Evils Sir tho we may set out in the Beginning with
moderate Salaries we shall find that such will not be of long
Continuance Reasons will never be wanting for proposd Augmentations
and there will always be a Party for giving more to the Rulers that the
Rulers may be able in Return to give more to them Hence as all History
informs us there has been in every State and Kingdom a constant kind of
Warfare between the Governing and the Governed the one striving to
obtain more for its Support and the other to pay less And this has
alone occasiond great Convulsions actual Civil Wars ending either in
dethroning of the Princes or enslaving of the People Generally indeed
the Ruling Power carries its Point and we see the Revenues of Princes
constantly increasing and we see that they are never satisfied but
always in want of more The more the People are discontented with the
Oppression of Taxes the greater Need the Prince has of Money to
distribute among his Partisans and pay the Troops that are to suppress
all Resistance and enable him to plunder at Pleasure There is scarce a
King in a hundred who would not if he could follow the Example of
Pharaohget first all the Peoples Money then all their Lands and
then make them and their Children Servants for ever It will be said
that we do not propose to establish Kings I know it But there is a
natural Inclination in Mankind to kingly Government It sometimes
relieves them from Aristocratic Domination They had rather have one
Tyrant than  It gives more of the Appearance of Equality among
Citizens and that they like I am apprehensive thereforeperhaps too
apprehensivethat the Government of these States may in future times
end in a Monarchy But this Catastrophe I think may be long delayd
if in our proposd System we do not sow the Seeds of Contention
Faction and Tumult by making our Posts of Honour Places of Profit If
we do I fear that tho we employ at first a Number and not a single
Person the Number will in time be set aside it will only nourish the
Ftus of a King as the honourable Gentleman from Virga very aptly
expressd it and a King will the sooner be set over us

It may be imagined by some that this is an Utopian Idea and that we
can never find Men to serve us in the Executive Department without
paying them well for their Services I conceive this to be a Mistake
Some existing Facts present themselves to me which incline me to a
contrary Opinion The High Sheriff of a County in England is an
honourable Office but it is not a profitable one It is rather
expensive and therefore not sought for But yet it is executed and
well executed and usually by some of the principal Gentlemen of the
County In France the Office of Counsellor or Member of their
judiciary Parliaments is more honourable It is therefore purchasd at
a High Price there are indeed Fees on the Law Proceedings which are
divided among them but these Fees do not amount to more than three per
cent on the Sum paid for the Place Therefore as legal Interest is
there at five per cent they in fact pay two per cent for being allowd
to do the Judiciary Business of the Nation which is at the same time
entirely exempt from the Burthen of paying them any Salaries for their
Services I do not however mean to recommend this as an eligible Mode
for our judiciary Department I only bring the Instance to show that
the Pleasure of doing Good and serving their Country and the Respect
such Conduct entitles them to are sufficient Motives with some Minds
to give up a great Portion of their Time to the Public without the mean
Inducement of pecuniary Satisfaction

Another Instance is that of a respectable Society who have made the
Experiment and practisd it with Success now more than a hundred
years I mean the Quakers It is an establishd Rule with them that they
are not to go to law but in their Controversies they must apply to
their Monthly Quarterly and Yearly Meetings Committees of these sit
with Patience to hear the Parties and spend much time in composing
their Differences In doing this they are supported by a Sense of Duty
and the Respect paid to Usefulness It is honourable to be so employd
but it was never made profitable by Salaries Fees or Perquisites And
indeed in all Cases of public Service the less the Profit the greater
the Honour

To bring the Matter nearer home have we not seen the greatest and most
important of our Offices that of General of our Armies executed for
Eight Years together without the smallest Salary by a patriot whom I
will not now offend by any other Praise and this thro Fatigues and
Distresses in common with the other brave Men his military Friends and
Companions and the constant Anxieties peculiar to his Station And
shall we doubt finding three or four Men in all the United States with
public Spirit enough to bear sitting in peaceful Council for perhaps an
equal Term merely to preside over our civil Concerns and see that our
Laws are duly executed Sir I have a better opinion of our Country I
think we shall never be without a sufficient Number of wise and good Men
to undertake and execute well and faithfully the Office in question

Sir the Saving of the Salaries that may at first be proposd is not
an object with me The subsequent Mischiefs of proposing them are what I
apprehend And therefore it is that I move the Amendment If it is not
seconded or accepted I must be contented with the Satisfaction of
having delivered my Opinion frankly and done my Duty



MOTION FOR PRAYERS IN THE CONVENTION

Motion made June  

MR PRESIDENT

The small Progress we have made after  or  Weeks close Attendance
and continual Reasonings with each other our different Sentiments on
almost every Question several of the last producing as many Noes as
Ayes is methinks a melancholy Proof of the Imperfection of the
Human Understanding We indeed seem to feel our own want of political
Wisdom since we have been running all about in Search of it We have
gone back to ancient History for Models of Government and examind the
different Forms of those Republics which having been originally
formd with the Seeds of their own Dissolution now no longer exist and
we have viewd modern States all round Europe but find none of their
Constitutions suitable to our Circumstances

In this Situation of this Assembly groping as it were in the dark to
find Political Truth and scarce able to distinguish it when presented
to us how has it happened Sir that we have not hitherto once thought
of humbly applying to the Father of Lights to illuminate our
Understandings In the Beginning of the Contest with Britain when we
were sensible of Danger we had daily Prayers in this Room for the
Divine Protection Our Prayers Sir were heardand they were
graciously answered All of us who were engagd in the Struggle must
have observed frequent Instances of a superintending Providence in our
Favour To that kind Providence we owe this happy Opportunity of
Consulting in Peace on the Means of establishing our future national
Felicity And have we now forgotten that powerful Friend or do we
imagine we no longer need its assistance I have lived Sir a long
time and the longer I live the more convincing proofs I see of this
Truth that GOD governs in the Affairs of Men And if a Sparrow
cannot fall to the Ground without His Notice is it probable that an
Empire can rise without His Aid We have been assured Sir in the
Sacred Writings that except the Lord build the House they labour in
vain that build it I firmly believe this and I also believe that
without his concurring Aid we shall succeed in this political Building
no better than the Builders of Babel we shall be divided by our little
partial local Interests our Projects will be confounded and we
ourselves shall become a Reproach and a Byeword down to future Ages
And what is worse Mankind may hereafter from this unfortunate
Instance despair of establishing Government by human Wisdom and leave
it to Chance War and Conquest

I therefore beg leave to move

That henceforth Prayers imploring the Assistance of Heaven and its
Blessing on our Deliberations be held in this Assembly every morning
before we proceed to Business and that one or more of the Clergy of
this city be requested to officiate in that ServiceM

  M The convention except three or four persons thought
      prayers unnecessary Franklins note



SPEECH IN THE CONVENTION

At the Conclusion of its Deliberations

September  

MR PRESIDENT

I confess that I do not entirely approve of this Constitution at
present but Sir I am not sure I shall never approve it for having
lived long I have experienced many instances of being obliged by
better information or fuller consideration to change my opinions even
on important subjects which I once thought right but found to be
otherwise It is therefore that the older I grow the more apt I am to
doubt my own judgment of others Most men indeed as well as most sects
in religion think themselves in possession of all truth and that
wherever others differ from them it is so far error Steele a
Protestant in a dedication tells the Pope that the only difference
between our two churches in their opinions of the certainty of their
doctrine is the Romish Church is infallible and the Church of
England is never in the wrong But though many private Persons think
almost as highly of their own infallibility as of that of their Sect
few express it so naturally as a certain French Lady who in a little
dispute with her sister said But I meet with nobody but myself that
is always in the right Je ne trouve que moi qui aie toujours
raison

In these sentiments Sir I agree to this Constitution with all its
faultsif they are such because I think a general Government
necessary for us and there is no form of government but what may be a
blessing to the people if well administered and I believe farther
that this is likely to be well administered for a course of years and
can only end in despotism as other forms have done before it when the
people shall become so corrupted as to need despotic government being
incapable of any other I doubt too whether any other Convention we
can obtain may be able to make a better constitution for when you
assemble a number of men to have the advantage of their joint wisdom
you inevitably assemble with those men all their prejudices their
passions their errors of opinion their local interests and their
selfish views From such an assembly can a perfect production be
expected It therefore astonishes me Sir to find this system
approaching so near to perfection as it does and I think it will
astonish our enemies who are waiting with confidence to hear that our
councils are confounded like those of the builders of Babel and that
our States are on the point of separation only to meet hereafter for
the purpose of cutting one anothers throats Thus I consent Sir to
this Constitution because I expect no better and because I am not sure
that it is not the best The opinions I have had of its errors I
sacrifice to the public good I have never whispered a syllable of them
abroad Within these walls they were born and here they shall die If
every one of us in returning to our Constituents were to report the
objections he has had to it and endeavour to gain Partisans in support
of them we might prevent its being generally received and thereby lose
all the salutary effects and great advantages resulting naturally in our
favour among foreign nations as well as among ourselves from our real
or apparent unanimity Much of the strength and efficiency of any
government in procuring and securing happiness to the people depends
on opinion on the general opinion of the goodness of that government
as well as of the wisdom and integrity of its governors I hope
therefore for our own sakes as a part of the people and for the sake
of our posterity that we shall act heartily and unanimously in
recommending this Constitution wherever our Influence may extend and
turn our future thoughts and endeavours to the means of having it well
administered

On the whole Sir I cannot help expressing a wish that every member of
the Convention who may still have objections to it would with me on
this occasion doubt a little of his own infallibility and to make
manifest our unanimity put his name to this Instrument

Then the motion was made for adding the last formula viz Done in
convention by the Unanimous Consent c which was agreed to and added
accordingly



TO THE EDITORS OF THE PENNSYLVANIA GAZETTE

On the Abuse of the Press



MESSRS HALL AND SELLERS

I lately heard a remark that on examination of The Pennsylvania
Gazette for fifty years from its commencement it appeared that
during that long period scarce one libellous piece had ever appeared in
it This generally chaste conduct of your paper is much to its
reputation for it has long been the opinion of sober judicious people
that nothing is more likely to endanger the liberty of the press than
the abuse of that liberty by employing it in personal accusation
detraction and calumny The excesses some of our papers have been
guilty of in this particular have set this State in a bad light abroad
as appears by the following letter which I wish you to publish not
merely to show your own disapprobation of the practice but as a caution
to others of the profession throughout the United States For I have
seen a European newspaper in which the editor who had been charged
with frequently calumniating the Americans justifies himself by saying
that he had published nothing disgraceful to us which he had not taken
from our own printed papers I am c

                                  New York March  

    DEAR FRIEND

    My Gout has at length left me after five Months painful
    Confinement It afforded me however the Leisure to read or
    hear read all the Packets of your various Newspapers which
    you so kindly sent for my Amusement

    Mrs W has partaken of it she likes to read the
    Advertisements but she remarks some kind of Inconsistency in
    the announcing so many Diversions for almost every Evening of
    the Week and such Quantities to be sold of expensive
    Superfluities Fineries and Luxuries just imported in a
    Country that at the same time fills its Papers with
    Complaints of Hard Times and Want of Money I tell her
    that such Complaints are common to all Times and all
    Countries and were made even in Solomons Time when as we
    are told Silver was as plenty in Jerusalem as the Stones in
    the Street and yet even then there were People who
    grumbled so as to incur this Censure from that knowing
    Prince Say not thou that the former Times were better than
    these for thou dost not enquire rightly concerning that
    matter

    But the Inconsistence that strikes me the most is that
    between the Name of your City Philadelphia Brotherly
    Love and the Spirit of Rancour Malice and Hatred that
    breathes in its Newspapers For I learn from those Papers
    that your State is divided into Parties that each Party
    ascribes all the public Operations of the other to vicious
    Motives that they do not even suspect one another of the
    smallest Degree of Honesty that the antifederalists are
    such merely from the Fear of losing Power Places or
    Emoluments which they have in Possession or in Expectation
    that the Federalists are a set of Conspirators who aim at
    establishing a Tyranny over the Persons and Property of their
    Countrymen and to live in Splendor on the Plunder of the
    People I learn too that your Justices of the Peace tho
    chosen by their Neighbours make a villainous Trade of their
    Office and promote Discord to augment Fees and fleece their
    Electors and that this would not be mended by placing the
    Choice in the Executive Council who with interested or
    party Views are continually making as improper Appointments
    witness a petty Fidler Sycophant and Scoundrel
    appointed Judge of the Admiralty an old Woman and
    Fomenter of Sedition to be another of the Judges and a
    Jeffries Chief Justice c c with two Harpies the
    Comptroller and Naval Officers to prey upon the Merchants
    and deprive them of their Property by Force of Arms c

    I am informd also by these Papers that your General
    Assembly tho the annual choice of the People shows no
    Regard to their Rights but from sinister Views or Ignorance
    makes Laws in direct Violation of the Constitution to divest
    the Inhabitants of their Property and give it to Strangers
    and Intruders and that the Council either fearing the
    Resentment of their Constituents or plotting to enslave
    them had projected to disarm them and given Orders for that
    purpose and finally that your President the unanimous
    joint choice of the Council and Assembly is an old
    Rogue who gave his Assent to the federal Constitution
    merely to avoid refunding Money he had purloind from the
    United States

    There is indeed a good deal of manifest Inconsistency in
    all this and yet a Stranger seeing it in your own Prints
    tho he does not believe it all may probably believe enough
    of it to conclude that Pennsylvania is peopled by a Set of
    the most unprincipled wicked rascally and quarrelsome
    Scoundrels upon the Face of the Globe I have sometimes
    indeed suspected that those Papers are the Manufacture of
    foreign Enemies among you who write with a view of
    disgracing your Country and making you appear contemptible
    and detestable all the World over but then I wonder at the
    Indiscretion of your Printers in publishing such Writings
    There is however one of your Inconsistencies that
    consoles me a little which is that tho living you give
    one another the characters of Devils dead you are all
    Angels It is delightful when any of you die to read what

REVEREND SIR

 I have been long impressed with the same sentiments you so well
express of the growing felicity of mankind from the improvements in
philosophy morals politics and even the conveniences of common
living by the invention and acquisition of new and useful utensils and
instruments that I have sometimes almost wished it had been my destiny
to be born two or three centuries hence For invention and improvement
are prolific and beget more of their kind The present progress is
rapid Many of great importance now unthought of will before that
period be produced and then I might not only enjoy their advantages
but have my curiosity gratified in knowing what they are to be I see a
little absurdity in what I have just written but it is to a friend who
will wink and let it pass while I mention one reason more for such a
wish which is that if the art of physic shall be improved in
proportion with other arts we may then be able to avoid diseases and
live as long as the patriarchs in Genesis to which I suppose we should
make little objection

TO THE EDITOR OF THE FEDERAL GAZETTE

A COMPARISON OF THE CONDUCT OF THE ANCIENT JEWS AND OF THE
ANTIFEDERALISTS IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA



A zealous Advocate for the proposd Federal Constitution in a certain
public Assembly said that the Repugnance of a great part of Mankind
to good Government was such that he believed that if an angel from
Heaven was to bring down a Constitution formd there for our Use it
would nevertheless meet with violent Opposition He was reprovd for
the supposd Extravagance of the Sentiment and he did not justify it
Probably it might not have immediately occurd to him that the
Experiment had been tryd and that the Event was recorded in the most
faithful of all Histories the Holy Bible otherwise he might as it
seems to me have supported his Opinion by that unexceptionable
Authority

The Supreme Being had been pleased to nourish up a single Family by
continued Acts of his attentive Providence till it became a great
People and having rescued them from Bondage by many Miracles
performed by his Servant Moses he personally deliverd to that chosen
Servant in the presence of the whole Nation a Constitution and Code of
Laws for their Observance accompanied and sanctiond with Promises of
great Rewards and Threats of severe Punishments as the Consequence of
their Obedience or Disobedience

This Constitution tho the Deity himself was to be at its Head and it
is therefore calld by Political Writers a Theocracy could not be
carried into Execution but by the Means of his Ministers Aaron and his
Sons were therefore commissiond to be with Moses the first
establishd Ministry of the new Government

One would have thought that this Appointment of Men who had
distinguishd themselves in procuring the Liberty of their Nation and
had hazarded their Lives in openly opposing the Will of a powerful
Monarch who would have retaind that Nation in Slavery might have been
an Appointment acceptable to a grateful People and that a Constitution
framd for them by the Deity himself might on that Account have been
secure of a universal welcome Reception Yet there were in every one of
the thirteen Tribes some discontented restless Spirits who were
continually exciting them to reject the proposd new Government and
this from various Motives

Many still retained an Affection for Egypt the Land of their Nativity
and these whenever they felt any Inconvenience or Hardship tho the
natural and unavoidable Effect of their Change of Situation exclaimd
against their Leaders as the Authors of their Trouble and were not only
for returning into Egypt but for stoning their deliverersN Those
inclind to idolatry were displeasd that their Golden Calf was
destroyd Many of the Chiefs thought the new Constitution might be
injurious to their particular Interests that the profitable Places
would be engrossed by the Families and Friends of Moses and Aaron and
others equally wellborn excludedO In Josephus and the Talmud we
learn some Particulars not so fully narrated in the Scripture We are
there told That Corah was ambitious of the Priesthood and offended
that it was conferred on Aaron and this as he said by the Authority
of Moses only without the Consent of the People He accusd Moses of
having by various Artifices fraudulently obtaind the Government and
deprivd the People of their Liberties and of conspiring with Aaron
to perpetuate the Tyranny in their Family Thus tho Corahs real
Motive was the Supplanting of Aaron he persuaded the People that he
meant only the Public Good and they moved by his Insinuations began
to cry out Let us maintain the Common Liberty of our respective
Tribes we have freed ourselves from the Slavery imposd on us by the
Egyptians and shall we now suffer ourselves to be made Slaves by Moses
If we must have a Master it were better to return to Pharaoh who at
least fed us with Bread and Onions than to serve this new Tyrant who
by his Operations has brought us into Danger of Famine Then they
called in question the Reality of his Conference with God and
objected the Privacy of the Meetings and the preventing any of the
People from being present at the Colloquies or even approaching the
Place as Grounds of great Suspicion They accused Moses also of
Peculation as embezzling part of the Golden Spoons and the Silver
Chargers that the Princes had offerd at the Dedication of the
AltarP and the Offerings of Gold by the common PeopleQ as well as
most of the PollTaxR and Aaron they accusd of pocketing much of the
Gold of which he pretended to have made a molten Calf Besides
Peculation they chargd Moses with Ambition to gratify which
Passion he had they said deceivd the People by promising to bring
them to a land flowing with Milk and Honey instead of doing which he
had brought them from such a Land and that he thought light of all
this mischief provided he could make himself an absolute PrinceS
That to support the new Dignity with Splendor in his Family the
partial PollTax already levied and given to AaronT was to be followd
by a general oneU which would probably be augmented from time to
time if he were suffered to go on promulgating new Laws on pretence of
new occasional Revelations of the divine Will till their whole Fortunes
were devourd by that Aristocracy

  N Numbers ch xiv Franklins note

  O Numbers ch xiv verse  And they gathered themselves
      together against Moses and Aaron and said unto them Ye
      take too much upon you seeing all the congregation are holy
      every one of them wherefore then lift ye up yourselves
      above the congregation

  P Numbers ch vii

  Q Exodus ch xxxv verse 

  R Numbers ch iii and Exodus ch xxx Franklins notes

  S Numbers ch xvi verse  Is it a small thing that thou
      hast brought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and
      honey to kill us in the wilderness except thou make thyself
      altogether a prince over us

  T Numbers ch iii

  U Exodus ch xxx

Moses denyd the Charge of Peculation and his Accusers were destitute
of Proofs to support it tho Facts if real are in their Nature
capable of Proof I have not said he with holy Confidence in the
Presence of his God I have not taken from this People the value of an
Ass nor done them any other Injury But his Enemies had made the
Charge and with some Success among the Populace for no kind of
Accusation is so readily made or easily believd by Knaves as the
Accusation of Knavery

In fine no less than two hundred and fifty of the principal Men
famous in the Congregation Men of RenownV heading and exciting the
Mob worked them up to such a pitch of Frenzy that they called out
Stone em stone em and thereby secure our Liberties and let us
chuse other Captains that may lead us back into Egypt in case we do
not succeed in reducing the Canaanites

  V Numbers ch xvi Franklins notes

On the whole it appears that the Israelites were a People jealous of
their newlyacquired Liberty which Jealousy was in itself no Fault
but when they sufferd it to be workd upon by artful Men pretending
Public Good with nothing really in view but private Interest they were
led to oppose the Establishment of the New Constitution whereby they
brought upon themselves much Inconvenience and Misfortune It appears
further from the same inestimable History that when after many Ages
that Constitution was become old and much abusd and an Amendment of it
was proposd the populace as they had accusd Moses of the Ambition of
making himself a Prince and cried out Stone him stone him so
excited by their High Priests and SCRIBES they exclaimd against the
Messiah that he aimd at becoming King of the Jews and cryd out
Crucify him Crucify him From all which we may gather that
popular Opposition to a public Measure is no Proof of its Impropriety
even tho the Opposition be excited and headed by Men of Distinction

To conclude I beg I may not be understood to infer that our General
Convention was divinely inspired when it formd the new federal
Constitution merely because that Constitution has been unreasonably and
vehemently opposed yet I must own I have so much Faith in the general
Government of the world by Providence that I can hardly conceive a
Transaction of such momentous Importance to the Welfare of Millions now
existing and to exist in the Posterity of a great Nation should be
suffered to pass without being in some degree influencd guided and
governed by that omnipotent omnipresent and beneficent Ruler in whom
all inferior Spirits live and move and have their Being

DEAR FRIEND

I am glad to see by the papers that our grand machine has at length
begun to work I pray God to bless and guide its operations If any form
of government is capable of making a nation happy ours I think bids
fair now for producing that effect But after all much depends upon
the people who are to be governed We have been guarding against an evil
that old States are most liable to excess of power in the rulers but
our present danger seems to be defect of obedience in the
subjects There is hope however from the enlightened state of
this age and country we may guard effectually against that evil as well
as the rest

My grandson William Temple Franklin will have the honour of presenting
this line He accompanied me to France and remained with me during my
mission I beg leave to recommend him to your notice and that you would
believe me my dear friend yours most affectionately

AN ACCOUNT OF THE SUPREMEST COURT OF JUDICATURE IN PENNSYLVANIA VIZ
THE COURT OF THE PRESS

From the Federal Gazette September  


Power of this Court

It may receive and promulgate accusations of all kinds against all
persons and characters among the citizens of the State and even against
all inferior courts and may judge sentence and condemn to infamy not
only private individuals but public bodies c with or without
inquiry or hearing at the courts discretion


In whose Favour and for whose Emolument this Court is established

In favour of about one citizen in five hundred who by education or
practice in scribbling has acquired a tolerable style as to grammar and
construction so as to bear printing or who is possessed of a press and
a few types This five hundredth part of the citizens have the privilege
of accusing and abusing the other four hundred and ninetynine parts at
their pleasure or they may hire out their pens and press to others for
that purpose


Practice of the Court

It is not governed by any of the rules of common courts of law The
accused is allowed no grand jury to judge of the truth of the accusation
before it is publicly made nor is the Name of the Accuser made known to
him nor has he an Opportunity of confronting the Witnesses against him
for they are kept in the dark as in the Spanish Court of Inquisition
Nor is there any petty Jury of his Peers sworn to try the Truth of the
Charges The Proceedings are also sometimes so rapid that an honest
good Citizen may find himself suddenly and unexpectedly accusd and in
the same Morning judgd and condemnd and sentence pronouncd against
him that he is a Rogue and a Villain Yet if an officer of this
court receives the slightest check for misconduct in this his office he
claims immediately the rights of a free citizen by the constitution and
demands to know his accuser to confront the witnesses and to have a
fair trial by a jury of his peers


The Foundation of its Authority

It is said to be founded on an Article of the Constitution of the State
which establishes the Liberty of the Press a Liberty which every
Pennsylvanian would fight and die for tho few of us I believe have
distinct Ideas of its Nature and Extent It seems indeed somewhat like
the Liberty of the Press that Felons have by the Common Law of
England before Conviction that is to be pressd to death or hanged
If by the Liberty of the Press were understood merely the Liberty of
discussing the Propriety of Public Measures and political opinions let
us have as much of it as you please But if it means the Liberty of
affronting calumniating and defaming one another I for my part own
myself willing to part With my Share of it when our Legislators shall
please so to alter the Law and shall cheerfully consent to exchange my
Liberty of Abusing others for the Privilege of not being abusd
myself


By whom this Court is commissioned or constituted

It is not by any Commission from the Supreme Executive Council who
might previously judge of the Abilities Integrity Knowledge c of
the Persons to be appointed to this great Trust of deciding upon the
Characters and good Fame of the Citizens for this Court is above that
Council and may accuse judge and condemn it at pleasure Nor
is it hereditary as in the Court of dernier Resort in the Peerage of
England But any Man who can procure Pen Ink and Paper with a Press
and a huge pair of BLACKING Balls may commissionate himself and his
court is immediately established in the plenary Possession and exercise
of its rights For if you make the least complaint of the judges
conduct he daubs his blacking balls in your face wherever he meets you
and besides tearing your private character to flitters marks you out
for the odium of the public as an enemy to the liberty of the press


Of the natural Support of these Courts

Their support is founded in the depravity of such minds as have not
been mended by religion nor improved by good education

    There is a Lust in Man no Charm can tame
     Of loudly publishing his Neighbours Shame

Hence

    On Eagles Wings immortal Scandals fly
     While virtuous Actions are but born and die
                                              DRYDEN

Whoever feels pain in hearing a good character of his neighbour will
feel a pleasure in the reverse And of those who despairing to rise
into distinction by their virtues are happy if others can be depressed
to a level with themselves there are a number sufficient in every great
town to maintain one of these courts by their subscriptions A shrewd
observer once said that in walking the streets in a slippery morning
one might see where the goodnatured people lived by the ashes thrown
on the ice before their doors probably he would have formed a
different conjecture of the temper of those whom he might find engaged
in such a subscription


Of the Checks proper to be established against the Abuse of Power in
these Courts

Hitherto there are none But since so much has been written and
published on the federal Constitution and the necessity of checks in
all other parts of good government has been so clearly and learnedly
explained I find myself so far enlightened as to suspect some check may
be proper in this part also but I have been at a loss to imagine any
that may not be construed an infringement of the sacred liberty of the
press At length however I think I have found one that instead of
diminishing general liberty shall augment it which is by restoring to
the people a species of liberty of which they have been deprived by our
laws I mean the liberty of the cudgel In the rude state of society
prior to the existence of laws if one man gave another ill language
the affronted person would return it by a box on the ear and if
repeated by a good drubbing and this without offending against any
law But now the right of making such returns is denied and they are
punished as breaches of the peace while the right of abusing seems to
remain in full force the laws made against it being rendered
ineffectual by the liberty of the press

My proposal then is to leave the liberty of the press untouched to be
exercised in its full extent force and vigor but to permit the
liberty of the cudgel to go with it pari passu Thus my
fellowcitizens if an impudent writer attacks your reputation dearer
to you perhaps than your life and puts his name to the charge you may
go to him as openly and break his head If he conceals himself behind
the printer and you can nevertheless discover who he is you may in
like manner waylay him in the night attack him behind and give him a
good drubbing Thus far goes my project as to private resentment and
retribution But if the public should ever happen to be affronted as
it ought to be with the conduct of such writers I would not advise
proceeding immediately to these extremities but that we should in
moderation content ourselves with tarring and feathering and tossing
them in a blanket

If however it should be thought that this proposal of mine may disturb
the public peace I would then humbly recommend to our legislators to
take up the consideration of both liberties that of the press and
that of the cudgel and by an explicit law mark their extent and
limits and at the same time that they secure the person of a citizen
from assaults they would likewise provide for the security of his
reputation



AN ADDRESS TO THE PUBLIC

From the Pennsylvania Society for Promoting the Abolition of Slavery
and the Relief of Free Negroes Unlawfully Held in Bondage

It is with peculiar satisfaction we assure the friends of humanity
that in prosecuting the design of our association our endeavours have
proved successful far beyond our most sanguine expectations

Encouraged by this success and by the daily progress of that luminous
and benign spirit of liberty which is diffusing itself throughout the
world and humbly hoping for the continuance of the divine blessing on
our labours we have ventured to make an important addition to our
original plan and do therefore earnestly solicit the support and
assistance of all who can feel the tender emotions of sympathy and
compassion or relish the exalted pleasure of beneficence

Slavery is such an atrocious debasement of human nature that its very
extirpation if not performed with solicitous care may sometimes open a
source of serious evils

The unhappy man who has long been treated as a brute animal too
frequently sinks beneath the common standard of the human species The
galling chains that bind his body do also fetter his intellectual
faculties and impair the social affections of his heart Accustomed to
move like a mere machine by the will of a master reflection is
suspended he has not the power of choice and reason and conscience
have but little influence over his conduct because he is chiefly
governed by the passion of fear He is poor and friendless perhaps worn
out by extreme labour age and disease

Under such circumstances freedom may often prove a misfortune to
himself and prejudicial to society

Attention to emancipated black people it is therefore to be hoped will
become a branch of our national policy but as far as we contribute to
promote this emancipation so far that attention is evidently a serious
duty incumbent on us and which we mean to discharge to the best of our
judgment and abilities

To instruct to advise to qualify those who have been restored to
freedom for the exercise and enjoyment of civil liberty to promote in
them habits of industry to furnish them with employments suited to
their age sex talents and other circumstances and to procure their
children an education calculated for their future situation in life
these are the great outlines of the annexed plan which we have adopted
and which we conceive will essentially promote the public good and the
happiness of these our hitherto too much neglected fellowcreatures

A plan so extensive cannot be carried into execution without
considerable pecuniary resources beyond the present ordinary funds of
the Society We hope much from the generosity of enlightened and
benevolent freemen and will gratefully receive any donations or
subscriptions for this purpose which may be made to our treasurer
James Starr or to James Pemberton chairman of our committee of
correspondence

                          Signed by order of the Society

MY VERY DEAR FRIEND

I received your Favor of August last Your kind Condolences on the
painful State of my Health are very obliging I am thankful to God
however that among the numerous Ills human Life is subject to one
only of any Importance is fallen to my Lot and that so late as almost
to insure that it can be but of short Duration

The Convulsions in France are attended with some disagreable
Circumstances but if by the Struggle she obtains and secures for the
Nation its future Liberty and a good Constitution a few Years
Enjoyment of those Blessings will amply repair all the Damages their
Acquisition may have occasioned God grant that not only the Love
of Liberty but a thorough Knowledge of the Rights of Man may pervade
all the Nations of the Earth so that a Philosopher may set his Foot
anywhere on its Surface and say This is my Country

Your Wishes for a cordial and perpetual Friendship between Britain and
her ancient Colonies are manifested continually in every one of your
Letters to me something of my Disposition on the same Subject may
appear to you in casting your Eye over the enclosed Paper I do not by
this Opportunity send you any of our Gazettes because the Postage from
Liverpool would be more than they are worth I can now only add my best
Wishes of every kind of Felicity for the three amiable Hartleys to whom
I have the honor of being an affectionate friend and most obedient
humble servant

REVEREND AND DEAR SIR

I received your kind Letter of Jany  and am glad you have at length
received the portrait of Govr Yale from his Family and deposited it in
the College Library He was a great and good Man and had the Merit of
doing infinite Service to your Country by his Munificence to that
Institution The Honour you propose doing me by placing mine in the same
Room with his is much too great for my Deserts but you always had a
Partiality for me and to that it must be ascribed I am however too
much obliged to Yale College the first learned Society that took Notice
of me and adorned me with its Honours to refuse a Request that comes
from it thro so esteemed a Friend But I do not think any one of the
Portraits you mention as in my Possession worthy of the Place and
Company you propose to place it in You have an excellent Artist lately
arrived If he will undertake to make one for you I shall cheerfully
pay the Expence but he must not delay setting about it or I may slip
thro his fingers for I am now in my eightyfifth year and very
infirm

I send with this a very learned Work as it seems to me on the antient
Samaritan Coins lately printed in Spain and at least curious for the
Beauty of the Impression Please to accept it for your College Library
I have subscribed for the Encyclopdia now printing here with the
Intention of presenting it to the College I shall probably depart
before the Work is finished but shall leave Directions for its
Continuance to the End With this you will receive some of the first
numbers

You desire to know something of my Religion It is the first time I have
been questioned upon it But I cannot take your Curiosity amiss and
shall endeavour in a few Words to gratify it Here is my Creed I
believe in one God Creator of the Universe That he governs it by his
Providence That he ought to be worshipped That the most acceptable
Service we render to him is doing good to his other Children That the
soul of Man is immortal and will be treated with Justice in another
Life respecting its Conduct in this These I take to be the fundamental
Principles of all sound Religion and I regard them as you do in
whatever Sect I meet with them

As to Jesus of Nazareth my Opinion of whom you particularly desire I
think the System of Morals and his Religion as he left them to us the
best the World ever saw or is likely to see but I apprehend it has
received various corrupting Changes and I have with most of the
present Dissenters in England some Doubts as to his Divinity tho it
is a question I do not dogmatize upon having never studied it and
think it needless to busy myself with it now when I expect soon an
Opportunity of knowing the Truth with less Trouble I see no harm
however in its being believed if that Belief has the good Consequence
as probably it has of making his Doctrines more respected and better
observed especially as I do not perceive that the Supreme takes it
amiss by distinguishing the Unbelievers in his Government of the World
with any peculiar Marks of his Displeasure

I shall only add respecting myself that having experienced the
Goodness of that Being in conducting me prosperously thro a long life
I have no doubt of its Continuance in the next though without the
smallest Conceit of meriting such Goodness My Sentiments on this Head
you will see in the Copy of an old Letter enclosed which I wrote in
answer to one from a zealous Religionist whom I had relieved in a
paralytic case by electricity and who being afraid I should grow proud
upon it sent me his serious though rather impertinent Caution I send
you also the Copy of another Letter which will shew something of my
Disposition relating to Religion With great and sincere Esteem and
Affection I am Your obliged old Friend and most obedient humble
Servant

                                                     B FRANKLIN

PS Had not your College some Present of Books from the King of France
Please to let me know if you had an Expectation given you of more and
the Nature of that Expectation I have a Reason for the Enquiry

I confide that you will not expose me to Criticism and censure by
publishing any part of this Communication to you I have ever let others
enjoy their religious Sentiments without reflecting on them for those
that appeared to me unsupportable and even absurd All Sects here and
we have a great Variety have experienced my good will in assisting them
with Subscriptions for building their new Places of Worship and as I
have never opposed any of their Doctrines I hope to go out of the World
in Peace with them all



ON THE SLAVETRADE

TO THE EDITOR OF THE FEDERAL GAZETTE

                                                 March d 

SIR

Reading last night in your excellent Paper the speech of Mr Jackson in
Congress against their meddling with the Affair of Slavery or
attempting to mend the Condition of the Slaves it put me in mind of a
similar One made about  Years since by Sidi Mehemet Ibrahim a member
of the Divan of Algiers which may be seen in Martins Account of his
Consulship anno  It was against granting the Petition of the Sect
called Erika or Purists who prayd for the Abolition of Piracy and
Slavery as being unjust Mr Jackson does not quote it perhaps he has
not seen it If therefore some of its Reasonings are to be found in
his eloquent Speech it may only show that mens Interests and
Intellects operate and are operated on with surprising similarity in all
Countries and Climates when under similar Circumstances The Africans
Speech as translated is as follows

    Allah Bismillah c God is great and Mahomet is his
    Prophet

    Have these Erika considered the Consequences of granting
    their Petition If we cease our Cruises against the
    Christians how shall we be furnished with the Commodities
    their Countries produce and which are so necessary for us
    If we forbear to make Slaves of their People who in this hot
    Climate are to cultivate our Lands Who are to perform the
    common Labours of our City and in our Families Must we not
    then be our own Slaves And is there not more Compassion and
    more Favour due to us as Mussulmen than to these Christian
    Dogs We have now above  Slaves in and near Algiers
    This Number if not kept up by fresh Supplies will soon
    diminish and be gradually annihilated If we then cease
    taking and plundering the Infidel Ships and making Slaves of
    the Seamen and Passengers our Lands will become of no Value
    for want of Cultivation the Rents of Houses in the City will
    sink one half and the Revenues of Government arising from
    its Share of Prizes be totally destroyd And for what To
    gratify the whims of a whimsical Sect who would have us not
    only forbear making more Slaves but even to manumit those we
    have

    But who is to indemnify their Masters for the Loss Will the
    State do it Is our Treasury sufficient Will the Erika do
    it Can they do it Or would they to do what they think
    Justice to the Slaves do a greater Injustice to the Owners
    And if we set our Slaves free what is to be done with them
    Few of them will return to their Countries they know too
    well the greater Hardships they must there be subject to
    they will not embrace our holy Religion they will not adopt
    our Manners our People will not pollute themselves by
    intermarrying with them Must we maintain them as Beggars in
    our Streets or suffer our Properties to be the Prey of their
    Pillage For Men long accustomd to Slavery will not work for
    a Livelihood when not compelld And what is there so
    pitiable in their present Condition Were they not Slaves in
    their own Countries

    Are not Spain Portugal France and the Italian states
    governd by Despots who hold all their Subjects in Slavery
    without Exception Even England treats its Sailors as Slaves
    for they are whenever the Government pleases seizd and
    confind in Ships of War condemnd not only to work but to
    fight for small Wages or a mere Subsistence not better
    than our Slaves are allowd by us Is their Condition then
    made worse by their falling into our Hands No they have
    only exchanged one Slavery for another and I may say a
    better for here they are brought into a Land where the Sun
    of Islamism gives forth its Light and shines in full
    Splendor and they have an Opportunity of making themselves
    acquainted with the true Doctrine and thereby saving their
    immortal Souls Those who remain at home have not that
    Happiness Sending the Slaves home then would be sending them
    out of Light into Darkness

    I repeat the Question What is to be done with them I have
    heard it suggested that they may be planted in the
    Wilderness where there is plenty of Land for them to subsist
    on and where they may flourish as a free State but they
    are I doubt too little disposd to labour without
    Compulsion as well as too ignorant to establish a good
    government and the wild Arabs would soon molest and destroy
    or again enslave them While serving us we take care to
    provide them with every thing and they are treated with
    Humanity The Labourers in their own Country are as I am
    well informed worse fed lodged and cloathed The Condition
    of most of them is therefore already mended and requires no
    further Improvement Here their Lives are in Safety They are
    not liable to be impressd for Soldiers and forcd to cut
    one anothers Christian Throats as in the Wars of their own
    Countries If some of the religious mad Bigots who now teaze
    us with their silly Petitions have in a Fit of blind Zeal
    freed their Slaves it was not Generosity it was not
    Humanity that movd them to the Action it was from the
    conscious Burthen of a Load of Sins and Hope from the
    supposed Merits of so good a Work to be excusd Damnation

    How grossly are they mistaken in imagining Slavery to be
    disallowd by the Alcoran Are not the two Precepts to quote
    no more Masters treat your Slaves with kindness Slaves
    serve your Masters with Cheerfulness and Fidelity clear
    Proofs to the contrary Nor can the Plundering of Infidels be
    in that sacred Book forbidden since it is well known from
    it that God has given the World and all that it contains
    to his faithful Mussulmen who are to enjoy it of Right as
    fast as they conquer it Let us then hear no more of this
    detestable Proposition the Manumission of Christian Slaves
    the Adoption of which would by depreciating our Lands and
    Houses and thereby depriving so many good Citizens of their
    Properties create universal Discontent and provoke
    Insurrections to the endangering of Government and producing
    general Confusion I have therefore no doubt but this wise
    Council will prefer the Comfort and Happiness of a whole
    Nation of true Believers to the Whim of a few Erika and
    dismiss their Petition

The Result was as Martin tells us that the Divan came to this
Resolution The Doctrine that Plundering and Enslaving the Christians
is unjust is at best problematical but that it is the Interest of
this State to continue the Practice is clear therefore let the
Petition be rejected

And it was rejected accordingly

And since like Motives are apt to produce in the Minds of Men like
Opinions and Resolutions may we not Mr Brown venture to predict
from this Account that the Petitions to the Parliament of England for
abolishing the SlaveTrade to say nothing of other Legislatures and
the Debates upon them will have a similar Conclusion I am Sir your
constant Reader and humble Servant

REMARKS CONCERNING THE SAVAGES OF NORTH AMERICA

Savages we call them because their Manners differ from ours which we
think the Perfection of Civility they think the same of theirs

Perhaps if we could examine the Manners of different Nations with
Impartiality we should find no People so rude as to be without any
Rules of Politeness nor any so polite as not to have some Remains of
Rudeness

The Indian Men when young are Hunters and Warriors when old
Counsellors for all their Government is by Counsel of the Sages there
is no Force there are no Prisons no Officers to compel Obedience or
inflict Punishment Hence they generally study Oratory the best Speaker
having the most Influence The Indian Women till the Ground dress the
Food nurse and bring up the Children and preserve and hand down to
Posterity the Memory of public Transactions These Employments of Men
and Women are accounted natural and honourable Having few artificial
Wants they have abundance of Leisure for Improvement by Conversation
Our laborious Manner of Life compared with theirs they esteem slavish
and base and the Learning on which we value ourselves they regard as
frivolous and useless An Instance of this occurred at the Treaty of
Lancaster in Pennsylvania anno  between the Government of
Virginia and the Six Nations After the principal Business was settled
the Commissioners from Virginia acquainted the Indians by a Speech that
there was at Williamsburg a College with a Fund for Educating Indian
youth and that if the Six Nations would send down half a dozen of
their young Lads to that College the Government would take care that
they should be well provided for and instructed in all the Learning of
the White People It is one of the Indian Rules of Politeness not to
answer a public Proposition the same day that it is made they think it
would be treating it as a light matter and that they show it Respect by
taking time to consider it as of a Matter important They therefore
deferrd their Answer till the Day following when their Speaker began
by expressing their deep Sense of the kindness of the Virginia
Government in making them that Offer for we know says he that you
highly esteem the kind of Learning taught in those Colleges and that
the Maintenance of our young Men while with you would be very
expensive to you We are convincd therefore that you mean to do us
Good by your Proposal and we thank you heartily But you who are wise
must know that different Nations have different Conceptions of things
and you will therefore not take it amiss if our Ideas of this kind of
Education happen not to be the same with yours We have had some
Experience of it Several of our young People were formerly brought up
at the Colleges of the Northern Provinces they were instructed in all
your Sciences but when they came back to us they were bad Runners
ignorant of every means of living in the Woods unable to bear either
Cold or Hunger knew neither how to build a Cabin take a Deer or kill
an Enemy spoke our Language imperfectly were therefore neither fit for
Hunters Warriors nor Counsellors they were totally good for nothing
We are however not the less obligd by your kind Offer tho we decline
accepting it and to show our grateful Sense of it if the Gentlemen of
Virginia will send us a Dozen of their Sons we will take great Care of
their Education instruct them in all we know and make Men of them

Having frequent Occasions to hold public Councils they have acquired
great Order and Decency in conducting them The old Men sit in the
foremost Ranks the Warriors in the next and the Women and Children in
the hindmost The Business of the Women is to take exact Notice of what
passes imprint it in their Memories for they have no Writing and
communicate it to their Children They are the Records of the Council
and they preserve Traditions of the Stipulations in Treaties  Years
back which when we compare with our Writings we always find exact He
that would speak rises The rest observe a profound Silence When he
has finishd and sits down they leave him  or  Minutes to recollect
that if he has omitted any thing he intended to say or has any thing
to add he may rise again and deliver it To interrupt another even in
common Conversation is reckond highly indecent How different this is
from the conduct of a polite British House of Commons where scarce a
day passes without some Confusion that makes the Speaker hoarse in
calling to Order and how different from the Mode of Conversation in
many polite Companies of Europe where if you do not deliver your
Sentence with great Rapidity you are cut off in the middle of it by the
Impatient Loquacity of those you converse with and never sufferd to
finish it

The Politeness of these Savages in Conversation is indeed carried to
Excess since it does not permit them to contradict or deny the Truth of
what is asserted in their Presence By this means they indeed avoid
Disputes but then it becomes difficult to know their Minds or what
Impression you make upon them The Missionaries who have attempted to
convert them to Christianity all complain of this as one of the great
Difficulties of their Mission The Indians hear with Patience the Truths
of the Gospel explaind to them and give their usual Tokens of Assent
and Approbation you would think they were convincd No such matter It
is mere Civility

A Swedish Minister having assembled the chiefs of the Susquehanah
Indians made a Sermon to them acquainting them with the principal
historical Facts on which our Religion is founded such as the Fall of
our first Parents by eating an Apple the coming of Christ to repair the
Mischief his Miracles and Suffering c When he had finished an
Indian Orator stood up to thank him What you have told us says he
is all very good It is indeed bad to eat Apples It is better to make
them all into Cyder We are much obligd by your kindness in coming so
far to tell us these Things which you have heard from your Mothers In
return I will tell you some of those we have heard from ours In the
Beginning our Fathers had only the Flesh of Animals to subsist on and
if their Hunting was unsuccessful they were starving Two of our young
Hunters having killd a Deer made a Fire in the Woods to broil some
Part of it When they were about to satisfy their Hunger they beheld a
beautiful young Woman descend from the Clouds and seat herself on that
Hill which you see yonder among the Blue Mountains They said to each
other it is a Spirit that has smelt our broiling Venison and wishes to
eat of it let us offer some to her They presented her with the Tongue
she was pleasd with the Taste of it and said Your kindness shall be
rewarded come to this Place after thirteen Moons and you shall find
something that will be of great Benefit in nourishing you and your
Children to the latest Generation They did so and to their Surprise
found Plants they had never seen before but which from that ancient
time have been constantly cultivated among us to our great Advantage
Where her right Hand had touched the Ground they found Maize where her
left hand had touchd it they found KidneyBeans and where her
Backside had sat on it they found Tobacco The good Missionary
disgusted with this idle Tale said What I delivered to you were
sacred Truths but what you tell me is mere Fable Fiction and
Falshood The Indian offended replyd My brother it seems your
Friends have not done you Justice in your Education they have not well
instructed you in the Rules of Common Civility You saw that we who
understand and practise those Rules believd all your stories why do
you refuse to believe ours

When any of them come into our Towns our People are apt to crowd round
them gaze upon them and incommode them where they desire to be
private this they esteem great Rudeness and the Effect of the Want of
Instruction in the Rules of Civility and good Manners We have say
they as much Curiosity as you and when you come into our Towns we
wish for Opportunities of looking at you but for this purpose we hide
ourselves behind Bushes where you are to pass and never intrude
ourselves into your Company

Their Manner of entring one anothers village has likewise its Rules It
is reckond uncivil in travelling Strangers to enter a Village abruptly
without giving Notice of their Approach Therefore as soon as they
arrive within hearing they stop and hollow remaining there till
invited to enter Two old Men usually come out to them and lead them
in There is in every Village a vacant Dwelling called the Strangers
House Here they are placd while the old Men go round from Hut to
Hut acquainting the Inhabitants that Strangers are arrivd who are
probably hungry and weary and every one sends them what he can spare of
Victuals and Skins to repose on When the Strangers are refreshd
Pipes and Tobacco are brought and then but not before Conversation
begins with Enquiries who they are whither bound what News c and
it usually ends with offers of Service if the Strangers have occasion
of Guides or any Necessaries for continuing their Journey and nothing
is exacted for the Entertainment

The same Hospitality esteemd among them as a principal Virtue is
practisd by private Persons of which Conrad Weiser our Interpreter
gave me the following Instance He had been naturalizd among the Six
Nations and spoke well the Mohock Language In going thro the Indian
Country to carry a Message from our Governor to the Council at
Onondaga he calld at the Habitation of Canassatego an old
Acquaintance who embracd him spread Furs for him to sit on placd
before him some boild Beans and Venison and mixd some Rum and Water
for his Drink When he was well refreshd and had lit his Pipe
Canassatego began to converse with him askd how he had fard the many
Years since they had seen each other whence he then came what
occasiond the Journey c Conrad answered all his Questions and when
the Discourse began to flag the Indian to continue it said Conrad
you have lived long among the white People and know something of their
Customs I have been sometimes at Albany and have observed that once
in Seven Days they shut up their Shops and assemble all in the great
House tell me what it is for What do they do there They meet
there says Conrad to hear and learn good Things I do not
doubt says the Indian that they tell you so they have told me the
same but I doubt the Truth of what they say and I will tell you my
Reasons I went lately to Albany to sell my Skins and buy Blankets
Knives Powder Rum c You know I usd generally to deal with Hans
Hanson but I was a little inclind this time to try some other
Merchant However I calld first upon Hans and asked him what he would
give for Beaver He said he could not give any more than four Shillings
a Pound but says he I cannot talk on Business now this is the Day
when we meet together to learn Good Things and I am going to the
Meeting So I thought to myself Since we cannot do any Business
today I may as well go to the meeting too and I went with him There
stood up a Man in Black and began to talk to the People very angrily I
did not understand what he said but perceiving that he lookd much at
me and at Hanson I imagind he was angry at seeing me there so I went
out sat down near the House struck Fire and lit my Pipe waiting till
the Meeting should break up I thought too that the Man had mentiond
something of Beaver and I suspected it might be the Subject of their
Meeting So when they came out I accosted my Merchant Well Hans
says I I hope you have agreed to give more than four Shillings a
Pound No says he I cannot give so much I cannot give more than
three shillings and sixpence I then spoke to several other Dealers
but they all sung the same songThree and sixpenceThree and
sixpence This made it clear to me that my Suspicion was right and
that whatever they pretended of meeting to learn good Things the real
purpose was to consult how to cheat Indians in the Price of Beaver
Consider but a little Conrad and you must be of my Opinion If they
met so often to learn good Things they would certainly have learnt
some before this time But they are still ignorant You know our
Practice If a white Man in travelling thro our Country enters one of
our Cabins we all treat him as I treat you we dry him if he is wet we
warm him if he is cold we give him Meat and Drink that he may allay
his Thirst and Hunger and we spread soft Furs for him to rest and sleep
on we demand nothing in return But if I go into a white Mans House
at Albany and ask for Victuals and Drink they say Where is your
Money and if I have none they say Get out you Indian Dog You see
they have not yet learned those little Good Things that we need no
Meetings to be instructed in because our Mothers taught them to us when
we were Children and therefore it is impossible their Meetings should
be as they say for any such purpose or have any such Effect they are
only to contrive the Cheating of Indians in the Price of Beaver

  NOTEIt is remarkable that in all Ages and Countries
  Hospitality has been allowd as the Virtue of those whom the
  civilizd were pleasd to call Barbarians The Greeks
  celebrated the Scythians for it The Saracens possessd it
  eminently and it is to this day the reigning Virtue of the
  wild Arabs St Paul too in the Relation of his Voyage and
  Shipwreck on the Island of Melita says the Barbarous People
  shewed us no little kindness for they kindled a fire and
  received us every one because of the present Rain and
  because of the Cold Franklins note



AN ARABIAN TALE

Albumazar the good magician retired in his old age to the top of the
lofty mountain Calabut avoided the society of men but was visited
nightly by genii and spirits of the first rank who loved him and
amused him with their instructive conversation

Belubel the strong came one evening to see Albumazar his height was
seven leagues and his wings when spread might overshadow a kingdom He
laid himself gently down between the long ridges of Elluem the tops of
the trees in the valley were his couch his head rested on Calabut as on
a pillow and his face shone on the tent of Albumazar

The magician spoke to him with rapturous piety of the wisdom and
goodness of the Most High but expressed his wonder at the existence of
evil in the world which he said he could not account for by all the
efforts of his reason

Value not thyself my friend said Belubel on that quality which
thou callest reason If thou knewest its origin and its weakness it
would rather be matter of humiliation

Tell me then said Albumazar what I do not know inform my
ignorance and enlighten my understanding Contemplate said
Albumazar sic Belubel the scale of beings from an elephant down
to an oyster Thou seest a gradual diminution of faculties and powers
so small in each step that the difference is scarce perceptible There
is no gap but the gradation is complete Men in general do not know
but thou knowest that in ascending from an elephant to the infinitely
Great Good and Wise there is also a long gradation of beings who
possess powers and faculties of which thou canst yet have no
conception



A PETITION OF THE LEFT HAND

TO THOSE WHO HAVE THE SUPERINTENDENCY OF EDUCATION

Date unknown

I address myself to all the friends of youth and conjure them to direct
their compassionate regards to my unhappy fate in order to remove the
prejudices of which I am the victim There are twin sisters of us and
the two eyes of man do not more resemble nor are capable of being upon
better terms with each other than my sister and myself were it not for
the partiality of our parents who make the most injurious distinctions
between us From my infancy I have been led to consider my sister as a
being of a more elevated rank I was suffered to grow up without the
least instruction while nothing was spared in her education She had
masters to teach her writing drawing music and other accomplishments
but if by chance I touched a pencil a pen or a needle I was bitterly
rebuked and more than once I have been beaten for being awkward and
wanting a graceful manner It is true my sister associated me with her
upon some occasions but she always made a point of taking the lead
calling upon me only from necessity or to figure by her side

But conceive not Sirs that my complaints are instigated merely by
vanity No my uneasiness is occasioned by an object much more serious
It is the practice in our family that the whole business of providing
for its subsistence falls upon my sister and myself If any
indisposition should attack my sisterand I mention it in confidence
upon this occasion that she is subject to the gout the rheumatism and
cramp without making mention of other accidentswhat would be the
fate of our poor family Must not the regret of our parents be
excessive at having placed so great a difference between sisters who
are so perfectly equal Alas we must perish from distress for it would
not be in my power even to scrawl a suppliant petition for relief
having been obliged to employ the hand of another in transcribing the
request which I have now the honour to prefer to you

Condescend Sirs to make my parents sensible of the injustice of an
exclusive tenderness and of the necessity of distributing their care
and affection among all their children equally I am with a profound
respect Sirs your obedient servant

                                                   THE LEFT HAND



SOME GOOD WHIG PRINCIPLES

Date unknown

DECLARATION of those RIGHTS of the Commonalty of Great Britain without
which they cannot be FREE

It is declared

First That the government of this realm and the making of laws for the
same ought to be lodged in the hands of King Lords of Parliament and
Representatives of the whole body of the freemen of this realm

Secondly That every man of the commonalty excepting infants insane
persons and criminals is of common right and by the laws of God a
freeman and entitled to the free enjoyment of liberty

Thirdly That liberty or freedom consists in having an actual share
in the appointment of those who frame the laws and who are to be the
guardians of every mans life property and peace for the all of one
man is as dear to him as the all of another and the poor man has an
equal right but more need to have representatives in the
legislature than the rich one

Fourthly That they who have no voice nor vote in the electing of
representatives do not enjoy liberty but are absolutely enslaved
to those who have votes and to their representatives for to be
enslaved is to have governors whom other men have set over us and be
subject to laws made by the representatives of others without having
had representatives of our own to give consent in our behalf

Fifthly That a very great majority of the commonalty of this realm
are denied the privilege of voting for representatives in Parliament
and consequently they are enslaved to a small number who do now
enjoy the privilege exclusively to themselves but who it may be
presumed are far from wishing to continue in the exclusive possession
of a privilege by which their fellowsubjects are deprived of common
right of justice of liberty and which if not communicated to
all must speedily cause the certain overthrow of our happy
constitution and enslave us all

And sixthly and lastly We also say and do assert that it is the
right of the commonalty of this realm to elect a new House of Commons
once in every year according to the ancient and sacred laws of the
land because whenever a Parliament continues in being for a longer
term very great numbers of the commonalty who have arrived at years
of manhood since the last election and therefore have a right to be
actually represented in the House of Commons are then unjustly
deprived of that right



THE ART OF PROCURING PLEASANT DREAMS

INSCRIBED TO MISS SHIPLEY BEING WRITTEN AT HER REQUEST

As a great part of our life is spent in sleep during which we have
sometimes pleasant and sometimes painful dreams it becomes of some
consequence to obtain the one kind and avoid the other for whether real
or imaginary pain is pain and pleasure is pleasure If we can sleep
without dreaming it is well that painful dreams are avoided If while
we sleep we can have any pleasing dream it is as the French say
autant de gagn so much added to the pleasure of life

To this end it is in the first place necessary to be careful in
preserving health by due exercise and great temperance for in
sickness the imagination is disturbed and disagreeable sometimes
terrible ideas are apt to present themselves Exercise should precede
meals not immediately follow them the first promotes the latter
unless moderate obstructs digestion If after exercise we feed
sparingly the digestion will be easy and good the body lightsome the
temper cheerful and all the animal functions performed agreeably
Sleep when it follows will be natural and undisturbed while
indolence with full feeding occasions nightmares and horrors
inexpressible we fall from precipices are assaulted by wild beasts
murderers and demons and experience every variety of distress
Observe however that the quantities of food and exercise are relative
things those who move much may and indeed ought to eat more those who
use little exercise should eat little In general mankind since the
improvement of cookery eat about twice as much as nature requires
Suppers are not bad if we have not dined but restless nights naturally
follow hearty suppers after full dinners Indeed as there is a
difference in constitutions some rest well after these meals it costs
them only a frightful dream and an apoplexy after which they sleep till
doomsday Nothing is more common in the newspapers than instances of
people who after eating a hearty supper are found dead abed in the
morning

Another means of preserving health to be attended to is the having a
constant supply of fresh air in your bedchamber It has been a great
mistake the sleeping in rooms exactly closed and in beds surrounded by
curtains No outward air that may come in to you is so unwholesome as
the unchanged air often breathed of a close chamber As boiling water
does not grow hotter by longer boiling if the particles that receive
greater heat can escape so living bodies do not putrefy if the
particles so fast as they become putrid can be thrown off Nature
expels them by the pores of the skin and the lungs and in a free open
air they are carried off but in a close room we receive them again and
again though they become more and more corrupt A number of persons
crowded into a small room thus spoil the air in a few minutes and even
render it mortal as in the Black Hole at Calcutta A single person is
said to spoil only a gallon of air per minute and therefore requires a
longer time to spoil a chamberfull but it is done however in
proportion and many putrid disorders hence have their origin It is
recorded of Methusalem who being the longest liver may be supposed to
have best preserved his health that he slept always in the open air
for when he had lived five hundred years an angel said to him Arise
Methusalem and build thee an house for thou shalt live yet five
hundred years longer But Methusalem answered and said If I am to
live but five hundred years longer it is not worth while to build me an
house I will sleep in the air as I have been used to do Physicians
after having for ages contended that the sick should not be indulged
with fresh air have at length discovered that it may do them good It
is therefore to be hoped that they may in time discover likewise that
it is not hurtful to those who are in health and that we may be then
cured of the arophobia that at present distresses weak minds and
makes them choose to be stifled and poisoned rather than leave open the
window of a bedchamber or put down the glass of a coach

Confined air when saturated with perspirable matter will not receive
more and that matter must remain in our bodies and occasion diseases
but it gives some previous notice of its being about to be hurtful by
producing certain uneasiness slight indeed at first which as with
regard to the lungs is a trifling sensation and to the pores of the
skin a kind of restlessness which is difficult to describe and few
that feel it know the cause of it But we may recollect that sometimes
on waking in the night we have if warmly covered found it difficult
to get asleep again We turn often without finding repose in any
position This fidgettiness to use a vulgar expression for want of a
better is occasioned wholly by an uneasiness in the skin owing to the
retention of the perspirable matterthe bedclothes having received
their quantity and being saturated refusing to take any more To
become sensible of this by an experiment let a person keep his position
in the bed but throw off the bedclothes and suffer fresh air to
approach the part uncovered of his body he will then feel that part
suddenly refreshed for the air will immediately relieve the skin by
receiving licking up and carrying off the load of perspirable matter
that incommoded it For every portion of cool air that approaches the
warm skin in receiving its part of that vapour receives therewith a
degree of heat that rarefies and renders it lighter when it will be
pushed away with its burthen by cooler and therefore heavier fresh air
which for a moment supplies its place and then being likewise changed
and warmed gives way to a succeeding quantity This is the order of
nature to prevent animals being infected by their own perspiration He
will now be sensible of the difference between the part exposed to the
air and that which remaining sunk in the bed denies the air access
for this part now manifests its uneasiness more distinctly by the
comparison and the seat of the uneasiness is more plainly perceived
than when the whole surface of the body was affected by it

Here then is one great and general cause of unpleasing dreams For
when the body is uneasy the mind will be disturbed by it and
disagreeable ideas of various kinds will in sleep be the natural
consequences The remedies preventive and curative follow

 By eating moderately as before advised for healths sake less
perspirable matter is produced in a given time hence the bedclothes
receive it longer before they are saturated and we may therefore sleep
longer before we are made uneasy by their refusing to receive any more

 By using thinner and more porous bedclothes which will suffer the
perspirable matter more easily to pass through them we are less
incommoded such being longer tolerable

 When you are awakened by this uneasiness and find you cannot easily
sleep again get out of bed beat up and turn your pillow shake the
bedclothes well with at least twenty shakes then throw the bed open
and leave it to cool in the meanwhile continuing undrest walk about
your chamber till your skin has had time to discharge its load which it
will do sooner as the air may be dried and colder When you begin to
feel the cold air unpleasant then return to your bed and you will soon
fall asleep and your sleep will be sweet and pleasant All the scenes
presented to your fancy will be too of the pleasing kind I am often as
agreeably entertained with them as by the scenery of an opera If you
happen to be too indolent to get out of bed you may instead of it
lift up your bedclothes with one arm and leg so as to draw in a good
deal of fresh air and by letting them fall force it out again This
repeated twenty times will so clear them of the perspirable matter they
have imbibed as to permit your sleeping well for some time afterwards
But this latter method is not equal to the former

Those who do not love trouble and can afford to have two beds will
find great luxury in rising when they wake in a hot bed and going into
the cool one Such shifting of beds would also be of great service to
persons ill of a fever as it refreshes and frequently procures sleep A
very large bed that will admit a removal so distant from the first
situation as to be cool and sweet may in a degree answer the same end

One or two observations more will conclude this little piece Care must
be taken when you lie down to dispose your pillow so as to suit your
manner of placing your head and to be perfectly easy then place your
limbs so as not to bear inconveniently hard upon one another as for
instance the joints of your ankles for though a bad position may at
first give but little pain and be hardly noticed yet a continuance will
render it less tolerable and the uneasiness may come on while you are
asleep and disturb your imagination These are the rules of the art
But though they will generally prove effectual in producing the end
intended there is a case in which the most punctual observance of them
will be totally fruitless I need not mention the case to you my dear
friend but my account of the art would be imperfect without it The
case is when the person who desires to have pleasant dreams has not
taken care to preserve what is necessary above all things

                                               A GOOD CONSCIENCE
